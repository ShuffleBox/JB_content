00:00.000 --> 00:05.920
Happy holidays, listener! We have a special episode for you this week. Some old friends

00:05.920 --> 00:10.400
join the show for a 3D printing special with Alex.

00:10.400 --> 00:18.240
Well, I'm joined today by a couple of special guests, long-time JB friends and former colleagues,

00:18.240 --> 00:22.040
I suppose. We've got Cheese on the line. Hey Cheese, how you doing?

00:22.040 --> 00:23.480
Hey, hey, how's it going?

00:23.480 --> 00:24.480
And Drew.

00:24.480 --> 00:25.480
Hello!

00:25.480 --> 00:30.440
Both of you are now in Colorado. You're both in Denver, serendipitously, I suppose. Cheese,

00:30.440 --> 00:33.880
you're working for System76 these days, and what about you, Drew?

00:33.880 --> 00:41.900
I am working for the Community College System, so we handle basically high-end IT and server

00:41.900 --> 00:45.860
needs for 13 different colleges across the state.

00:45.860 --> 00:48.720
And you do chew my ear off about OpenShift on occasion.

00:48.720 --> 00:49.720
Every now and then, yeah.

00:49.720 --> 00:54.360
It has been known. What about you, Cheese? What are you doing for System76?

00:54.360 --> 00:59.240
Right now, I'm working with the marketing department, doing videography, photography,

00:59.240 --> 01:04.200
some animation, graphic design stuff, all sorts of fun, cool things.

01:04.200 --> 01:08.480
I feel like breaking out into Troy McClure at this point, you may remember Cheese from

01:08.480 --> 01:14.200
shows such as The Friday Stream and all sorts of other Linux Unplugged, all sorts of stuff.

01:14.200 --> 01:18.160
If you're a long-time JB listener, these two guys will be very familiar to you.

01:18.160 --> 01:22.760
So I've got these two today to talk to you all about 3D printing. This is a topic that

01:22.760 --> 01:28.400
we covered very briefly in an episode of Self-Hosted recently, and lots of feedback came my way

01:28.400 --> 01:30.360
that you'd like a bit more information.

01:30.360 --> 01:35.720
So I have two guys that are at different points in their 3D printing journey.

01:35.720 --> 01:41.040
So just very quickly, Drew, perhaps you could give us a very quick overview of where you're

01:41.040 --> 01:43.720
at in your journey and that kind of thing.

01:43.720 --> 01:44.720
Sure.

01:44.720 --> 01:52.080
So just a few months ago, I purchased my first 3D printer and have been kind of getting up

01:52.080 --> 01:54.720
to speed since then.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.880
It's a smaller unit.

01:56.880 --> 02:02.680
We'll talk more about the actual gear a little later, but it's a very much the beginner's

02:02.680 --> 02:06.760
entrance style unit that one might pick up.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.940
It's not super fancy.

02:08.940 --> 02:11.920
So you're looking at this discussion through the lens of someone who's been printing for

02:11.920 --> 02:12.920
a few months.

02:12.920 --> 02:14.320
And what about you, Cheese?

02:14.320 --> 02:15.320
Where are you at in your journey?

02:15.320 --> 02:19.200
Well, I've been printing now for a couple of years.

02:19.200 --> 02:24.280
After encouragement, I believe it was from Linux Fest Northwest, where we all met up

02:24.280 --> 02:31.120
and you had printed some things, which encouraged me just to bite the bullet and buy a printer.

02:31.120 --> 02:36.160
So I've been using basically the same printer as Drew for quite some time over the last

02:36.160 --> 02:39.160
couple of years and learned that I enjoy the hobby.

02:39.160 --> 02:42.280
So I want to expand that and picked up a new printer recently.

02:42.280 --> 02:47.480
Yeah, I think I 3D printed a carabiner clip to hold my luggage together or something.

02:47.480 --> 02:48.480
Yeah.

02:48.480 --> 02:49.800
I believe it was that.

02:49.800 --> 02:57.640
And you had also printed the on-air signs that were powered by the little NodeMCUs.

02:57.640 --> 02:58.640
Those things are so cool.

02:58.640 --> 03:01.000
Yeah, I think that's what pushed me over the edge.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.540
Well, I'm glad you like them.

03:03.540 --> 03:06.840
Of course, they're running WLED, so I hope you've been keeping them up to date.

03:06.840 --> 03:11.560
There's lots of new features on that stuff these days on the ESP side of things.

03:11.560 --> 03:19.800
So I've been 3D printing a little bit off and on for four, I guess, years.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.800
Quite a long time, I guess.

03:21.800 --> 03:26.640
I got into it through wanting to print little parts for my racing drones.

03:26.640 --> 03:32.260
The perfect use case for me was to print custom holders for all the little tiny circuit boards

03:32.260 --> 03:34.760
that go into an FPV racing drone.

03:34.760 --> 03:41.520
And so I learned very basic CAD skills, computer-aided design skills through stuff like Tinkercad

03:41.520 --> 03:43.200
and Fusion 360.

03:43.200 --> 03:50.020
I am not very good, but I can 3D print a cube or a little square box I made for something

03:50.020 --> 03:51.800
easily enough.

03:51.800 --> 03:55.480
And so I've had probably three or four prints.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.400
I think I'm on my fourth printer now.

03:57.400 --> 04:02.120
I've had some of the cheap Chinese ones, and I've got Prusas these days, but we'll come

04:02.120 --> 04:03.400
on to that stuff a bit more later.

04:03.400 --> 04:08.640
But first of all, I thought it might be helpful to talk about what is 3D printing a little

04:08.640 --> 04:10.860
bit for those that aren't familiar with it.

04:10.860 --> 04:14.600
Would either of you two like to take that mantle?

04:14.600 --> 04:21.000
I feel like as the junior here, that you as the senior printer should take that.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.840
All right, fine, fine, fine.

04:23.840 --> 04:29.560
Okay, so what we call 3D printing is actually technically probably referred to as a bit

04:29.560 --> 04:34.000
like calling a Docker container a container and Linux container.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.840
It's that whole Kleenex debate, right?

04:35.840 --> 04:41.620
So what we're actually talking about is what's called FDM printing, fused deposition modeling.

04:41.620 --> 04:45.920
And essentially what that does is it takes a spool of plastic filament, it can be of

04:45.920 --> 04:47.300
different materials.

04:47.300 --> 04:51.880
So there's three main types that I print with, I'll come on to those in a moment.

04:51.880 --> 04:59.720
But essentially what FDM printing does is it takes in a spaghetti sized piece of plastic,

04:59.720 --> 05:06.720
squishes it through what's called a hot end, melts that plastic at 220 ish Celsius.

05:06.720 --> 05:12.240
It varies on the different filament that you use, the chemical properties of that filament.

05:12.240 --> 05:16.840
So it takes that filament in through a drive gear, squishes it through the hot end, melts

05:16.840 --> 05:17.840
it.

05:17.840 --> 05:23.560
And then the pressure of the drive gears forcing that filament through, forces it out of what's

05:23.560 --> 05:27.040
called a nozzle at the bottom of your hot end.

05:27.040 --> 05:31.040
And so the hot end is the thing that contains the thermistor and it's what contains the

05:31.040 --> 05:34.480
other chamber where the melted plastic is and all that kind of stuff.

05:34.480 --> 05:38.620
And right at the very end of the process is the nozzle, which is what, you know, if you've

05:38.620 --> 05:45.760
ever watched a video of a 3D printer printing, it's that kind of nozzle shaped thing, funnel

05:45.760 --> 05:51.420
shaped thing on the bottom where the plastic actually gets extruded out of.

05:51.420 --> 05:59.360
And essentially the basic premise is you can use what's called G-code to move stepper motors

05:59.360 --> 06:02.840
left and right, up and down, forwards and backwards.

06:02.840 --> 06:07.600
You can use G-code to control the movement of that nozzle such that it will form layers

06:07.600 --> 06:08.600
of plastic.

06:08.600 --> 06:15.240
You know, we're talking an extruded line of plastic will be half a millimeter wide, a

06:15.240 --> 06:16.600
millimeter wide at most.

06:16.600 --> 06:23.360
And what it will do is it will build up layer upon layer upon layer of plastic to form models.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.360
It has some limitations.

06:24.360 --> 06:29.260
Obviously you can't print stuff with certain overhangs in certain shapes because the layer

06:29.260 --> 06:35.360
by layer construction of these things presupposes that there is a support underneath.

06:35.360 --> 06:39.040
So there's all sorts of different ways you can get around that by including supports

06:39.040 --> 06:41.360
in your models and things like that.

06:41.360 --> 06:45.000
But ultimately there are some shapes that just aren't very well suited to 3D printing,

06:45.000 --> 06:50.160
you know, a complete sphere would be quite tricky because it wouldn't be able to stick

06:50.160 --> 06:52.440
to what's called the print bed.

06:52.440 --> 06:57.180
And so one of the most difficult parts of 3D printing, which I'm sure both of you can

06:57.180 --> 07:02.680
attest to, is that first layer adhesion.

07:02.680 --> 07:07.200
Definitely I know whenever I first started, layer adhesion was definitely a thing for

07:07.200 --> 07:08.200
me.

07:08.200 --> 07:14.020
I was using the inexpensive removable bed that came with my printer and quickly found

07:14.020 --> 07:19.000
out that that probably wasn't the best idea, especially after cracking off one print and

07:19.000 --> 07:21.880
then kind of putting a crease in part of the removable bed.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.560
Well, you're doing better than me.

07:23.560 --> 07:29.400
I had a Creality CR-10 as my first printer and I went to Ikea and purchased a mirror

07:29.400 --> 07:32.720
tile, which is I think about 12 inches square.

07:32.720 --> 07:36.880
And I actually had something stick to the glass so hard that when I was trying to unstick

07:36.880 --> 07:42.560
and unpeel this damn thing, that the print actually smashed the mirror when I took a

07:42.560 --> 07:45.000
chunk of glass with it.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
That's impressive.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.080
Yeah, I mean, I was able to get mine leveled out pretty good, but I definitely had to go

07:50.080 --> 07:51.960
to a glass bed.

07:51.960 --> 08:00.160
So even with the original mat that came with my Ender 3, I honestly didn't have many adhesion

08:00.160 --> 08:06.560
problems with PLA, which we'll get into the types of plastics that you can use.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.780
But PLA I had no trouble with.

08:08.780 --> 08:14.880
It's when I started going on to more exotic filaments that I'm using now that I really

08:14.880 --> 08:17.520
started having adhesion problems.

08:17.520 --> 08:22.460
Fortunately I was finally able to suss them out, but it's taken some time and a lot of

08:22.460 --> 08:25.020
experimentation to get there.

08:25.020 --> 08:26.020
It does.

08:26.020 --> 08:30.800
I think we should dispel the myth right now that 3D printing is out of the box, ready

08:30.800 --> 08:32.520
to go hobby.

08:32.520 --> 08:37.880
It's not like you can go to Best Buy and buy a 3D printer like you could a paper printer,

08:37.880 --> 08:41.840
for want of a better word, and just press go and expect it to work first time every

08:41.840 --> 08:42.840
time.

08:42.840 --> 08:43.840
That's just not the reality.

08:43.840 --> 08:47.080
They are very finely-toleranced machines.

08:47.080 --> 08:51.600
We're talking microns of a millimetre makes a big difference to how well a layer sticks

08:51.600 --> 08:52.600
or doesn't.

08:52.600 --> 08:57.240
A few particles of dust can make the difference between a print sticking or not.

08:57.240 --> 08:58.860
Well, and it's not just that.

08:58.860 --> 09:04.580
There are so many different things that can really matter here, like the temperature that

09:04.580 --> 09:09.360
you have the filament coming out at, the temperature that you have the bed sitting at, whether

09:09.360 --> 09:14.100
or not it's in an enclosure depending on what type of material it is.

09:14.100 --> 09:19.020
There are so many different variables that you can mess up and just totally throw off

09:19.020 --> 09:20.020
the whole thing.

09:20.020 --> 09:22.320
All right, so let's break down the filaments for a second.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.160
We mentioned PLA.

09:24.160 --> 09:27.900
That's probably the most beginner-friendly one that's available, and probably the most

09:27.900 --> 09:29.480
popular to be honest.

09:29.480 --> 09:32.180
PLA has a few interesting characteristics.

09:32.180 --> 09:35.420
First of all, it's very easy to work with.

09:35.420 --> 09:37.300
There's very little in the way of stringing.

09:37.300 --> 09:44.100
It doesn't require a particularly sticky bed in order to adhese properly, but it can be

09:44.100 --> 09:45.380
quite brittle.

09:45.380 --> 09:49.640
For stuff like my racing drone parts, for example, when it got a bit cold outside, I'd

09:49.640 --> 09:55.460
slam my drone into a tree or something, and the stuff would just snap, it would just crack.

09:55.460 --> 10:01.220
It's good for indoor stuff like plant pots, or I've got a rocket lamp behind me that I

10:01.220 --> 10:03.980
3D printed, for example, so a Saturn V rocket.

10:03.980 --> 10:09.220
It's good for that kind of stuff where there's very little load and very little stress on

10:09.220 --> 10:10.220
the print.

10:10.220 --> 10:14.740
But if you're wanting to do anything where heat is an issue, let's say you're printing

10:14.740 --> 10:21.900
a bracket for your car, another 3D print I've done, a functional print, is a dash cam bracket

10:21.900 --> 10:29.500
for my car, and a car in the south of the United States gets pretty warm in the summer.

10:29.500 --> 10:33.860
I'm talking to a Texan and I'm well aware that you guys get warm too, but you know what

10:33.860 --> 10:34.860
I'm saying, right?

10:34.860 --> 10:39.420
If you were to try and use PLA in that environment, very quickly that plastic would get to what

10:39.420 --> 10:45.020
it's called its glass transition point and start softening drastically.

10:45.020 --> 10:49.300
And eventually, if it's under any kind of load, even if it's just from a dash cam, a

10:49.300 --> 10:53.940
few grams, it would start to warp and twist and eventually melt.

10:53.940 --> 10:59.340
Yeah, and I think that that depends on your print too because a print that I had made

10:59.340 --> 11:04.500
for some friends, they had an above-ground pool and on that pool was a railing that,

11:04.500 --> 11:09.980
I don't know the diameter of that railing, but they had no cup holders, right?

11:09.980 --> 11:14.260
So everyone was trying to figure out like where do I set my drink down.

11:14.260 --> 11:18.400
So I made some cup holders and it just had these little hooks that hooked over the top

11:18.400 --> 11:24.060
of the ring on the pool and was able to put your drink there.

11:24.060 --> 11:31.820
And they probably sat out there for a little over a year before one of them finally failed

11:31.820 --> 11:34.140
and one of the little arms had cracked.

11:34.140 --> 11:38.620
And I don't know if that's because somebody bumped it or how it happened, but it can hold

11:38.620 --> 11:46.260
up to some extent, but under a magnified windshield in the heat, direct heat, probably not the

11:46.260 --> 11:47.260
best.

11:47.260 --> 11:48.460
There's no chances there.

11:48.460 --> 11:53.100
So for that kind of application, you want to be looking at something called PETG.

11:53.100 --> 11:58.300
There are a few other types that are suitable for sort of higher temperature environments,

11:58.300 --> 12:01.820
but PETG in particular is one of my go-tos.

12:01.820 --> 12:06.940
It's sort of chemically related to PLA, so it takes the best bits of PLA and another

12:06.940 --> 12:13.060
plastic called ABS, which is famously difficult to print and work with because of things like

12:13.060 --> 12:18.040
warping, which is where during a print, the corners of a print will lift and then the

12:18.040 --> 12:23.380
entire model is put under intense stress and it can start to crack and all that kind of

12:23.380 --> 12:24.380
stuff.

12:24.380 --> 12:29.140
But PETG is probably the best of both worlds.

12:29.140 --> 12:35.380
It's got pretty much the same ease of printing as PLA and almost the same heat-resistant

12:35.380 --> 12:37.580
characteristics as ABS.

12:37.580 --> 12:44.060
The downside to PETG is it can be a very sticky thing indeed.

12:44.060 --> 12:47.340
That was the filament that stuck to my glass bed and took a chunk of glass with it, for

12:47.340 --> 12:48.340
example.

12:48.340 --> 12:54.300
So chemically, it's very good at bonding with the build layer, the build surface on certain

12:54.300 --> 12:55.300
printers.

12:55.300 --> 12:58.700
So for my Prusa behind me, for example, I actually have two separate sheets.

12:58.700 --> 13:03.860
I have a texture sheet from Prusa, which is actually designed for PETG and a separate

13:03.860 --> 13:07.980
one for PLA just so that I have that separation of concerns.

13:07.980 --> 13:12.260
I don't have to worry about glue sticks or any other kind of nonsense or tape or anything

13:12.260 --> 13:13.260
like that.

13:13.260 --> 13:18.900
It's worth mentioning too that PETG is the slightly more exotic material I referenced

13:18.900 --> 13:22.620
earlier that I was moving towards and was having adhesion issues.

13:22.620 --> 13:28.740
It does require more heat than PLA to really get it to flow nicely and you also can't

13:28.740 --> 13:35.860
print as fast because to get it to where it's flowing well, if you get it flowing too well,

13:35.860 --> 13:41.820
then it bubbles and you need a hotter bed to really get it to stick well.

13:41.820 --> 13:48.260
It's a lot more finicky, but not as finicky as something like ABS or anything like that.

13:48.260 --> 13:58.900
So we're talking about with PLA for example, the hot end is around 180 Celsius and typically

13:58.900 --> 14:01.940
I run my bed at around 60 Celsius.

14:01.940 --> 14:08.700
With PETG, I can run my hot end anywhere from 220 to 250 depending on the particular filament

14:08.700 --> 14:13.380
properties and the bed is anywhere from 80 to 90 degrees Celsius.

14:13.380 --> 14:17.840
So there's a good step up there in the temperature and therefore energy required to use this

14:17.840 --> 14:23.700
filament, but that's why it performs better in heat sensitive environments.

14:23.700 --> 14:31.300
Speaking of, different filaments from different manufacturers can have vastly different responses.

14:31.300 --> 14:38.980
I'm using various filaments from Micro Center and I have my bed turned up to about 100.

14:38.980 --> 14:44.780
I find it works a little better, but I can print with the PETG itself down at about 230

14:44.780 --> 14:50.500
which is the low end of what Micro Center actually recommends for that filament.

14:50.500 --> 14:51.500
Really it just depends.

14:51.500 --> 14:56.900
Yeah, most manufacturers will print a recommended set of settings on the side and that's generally

14:56.900 --> 15:02.860
a good place to start, but you will need to start printing things like calibration cubes

15:02.860 --> 15:07.300
and temperature towers and torture tests and all this kind of thing.

15:07.300 --> 15:10.800
If you're moving to a completely new supplier of filament and you're not seeing the results

15:10.800 --> 15:15.300
you would expect, there's all sorts of things on a website called Thingiverse that you can

15:15.300 --> 15:21.900
actually download for free to import into your printer's slicer software and send across

15:21.900 --> 15:23.020
to the printer.

15:23.020 --> 15:29.320
So speaking of slicers, Cheese, we haven't really touched on that much at all yet.

15:29.320 --> 15:30.320
Would you like to?

15:30.320 --> 15:35.740
Yeah, so a slicer is basically exactly what it sounds like.

15:35.740 --> 15:41.200
As Alex had mentioned earlier, with FDM you're laying down layer by layer, so a slicer will

15:41.200 --> 15:48.740
take your 3D model and separate it layer by layer, drawing the path and or creating the

15:48.740 --> 15:55.660
G-code that allows the printer to know in X, Y, and Z in space where the nozzle needs

15:55.660 --> 15:57.700
to be at any given time.

15:57.700 --> 16:00.980
And then once you've taken your model and you've sliced it, then you can import that

16:00.980 --> 16:04.360
G-code directly into your printer and print your model.

16:04.360 --> 16:09.540
So there are a couple of different pieces of software, Cura, which is one that I'm a

16:09.540 --> 16:15.380
little more familiar with, that's C-U-R-A, it's really great.

16:15.380 --> 16:20.700
And then Prusa, the manufacturer of 3D printers, actually has their own piece of software.

16:20.700 --> 16:26.780
I think they, it's a fork of slicer was the original name and now it's just referred to

16:26.780 --> 16:30.380
as Prusa Slicer, but it's kind of the de facto for them.

16:30.380 --> 16:34.500
It's spelled Slic3R, if you're looking for that on the internet.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.500
Yeah, that's it.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.140
It's LeetSpeak spelled, right?

16:37.140 --> 16:43.580
But yeah, it's a great one as well and I'm learning more of that now that I've purchased

16:43.580 --> 16:51.340
a Prusa printer, but Cura is also fantastic and there are a lot of settings that you can

16:51.340 --> 16:53.760
take from other resources.

16:53.760 --> 17:02.100
So I know Chep is one of the guys I took his settings for Cura originally and they worked

17:02.100 --> 17:09.460
really well for me, better than the stock settings that were suggested by Cura itself.

17:09.460 --> 17:14.100
So I'm pretty curious to know how the humidity has affected you, because I know you've just

17:14.100 --> 17:19.480
moved from Texas to Colorado, but obviously there's a drastic humidity difference between

17:19.480 --> 17:26.500
the Gulf Coast and the Colorado air and PETG is famously hygroscopic, so what that means

17:26.500 --> 17:29.340
is it will absorb water from the air around it.

17:29.340 --> 17:33.900
So me and Riley, for example, with my relatively high humidity, I have to keep my filament

17:33.900 --> 17:38.660
in a dry box full of silica gel in order to try and keep it relatively usable.

17:38.660 --> 17:44.060
I was wondering, have you noticed any difference in how you store your filaments and how easily

17:44.060 --> 17:48.500
they print or not at the different altitudes and humidity levels?

17:48.500 --> 17:53.100
Well for me, I haven't really experimented with much outside of PLA.

17:53.100 --> 18:01.380
So I know the PETG, like you said, has a lot more, is hygroscopic as you mentioned.

18:01.380 --> 18:08.020
But I will say that with PLA, I have noticed that moving from Texas along the Gulf Coast

18:08.020 --> 18:17.440
to here in Colorado, even the PLA, it gets more brittle than normal.

18:17.440 --> 18:26.220
So it's not like I keep it in a humidifier or something, but once I get through the batch

18:26.220 --> 18:30.420
of filament that I have now and I move over to PETG, I'll know a little bit more.

18:30.420 --> 18:36.180
But so far, the humidity and the change in humidity has affected the PLA, but not significantly

18:36.180 --> 18:38.380
to the point where I can't print with what I have.

18:38.380 --> 18:41.620
How about you, Drew, how's your experience been?

18:41.620 --> 18:44.380
So I've only been doing this a few months.

18:44.380 --> 18:52.100
I'm not sure how quickly PETG under circumstances like yours, Alex, would really take on enough

18:52.100 --> 18:56.100
water to need to be dried before printing.

18:56.100 --> 18:59.420
But it could be a month, it could be three or four months.

18:59.420 --> 19:01.340
I mean, it really depends.

19:01.340 --> 19:05.620
For example, you were living in Georgia before and now you're in Colorado.

19:05.620 --> 19:12.660
Similar thing as cheese really, an ocean level of Gulf humidity moving up to the mountains.

19:12.660 --> 19:21.460
So here I have had my PETG sitting out for a while and I keep it in a box most of the

19:21.460 --> 19:22.460
time.

19:22.460 --> 19:28.100
But I don't like after a print is finished, heat up the end and pull the filament and

19:28.100 --> 19:29.740
put it back in the box.

19:29.740 --> 19:32.940
I tend to just kind of leave it on the roll.

19:32.940 --> 19:34.380
You should be fine where you are now.

19:34.380 --> 19:38.300
I mean, I was wondering whether you'd noticed any difference in terms of how, because I

19:38.300 --> 19:43.060
know for example, things like boiling a kettle takes longer altitude and baking recipes are

19:43.060 --> 19:44.060
slightly different.

19:44.060 --> 19:45.060
Yeah, exactly.

19:45.060 --> 19:54.900
So no, I haven't had any issues just leaving my PETG on the roll for weeks.

19:54.900 --> 19:56.300
Still prints fine.

19:56.300 --> 19:58.020
All right.

19:58.020 --> 20:05.020
Well talking of software, we mentioned PrusaSlicer and Cura, those are the two main slicers.

20:05.020 --> 20:09.640
There's another piece of software that I think everybody ought to know about called Octoprint.

20:09.640 --> 20:10.900
Wonderful piece of software.

20:10.900 --> 20:12.660
It's like the best thing.

20:12.660 --> 20:13.660
Wonderful.

20:13.660 --> 20:19.800
Seriously, if you are getting into 3D printing, just do yourself a favor and Google Octoprint.

20:19.800 --> 20:26.620
It is something that you install on like a Raspberry Pi and you connect it to your printer

20:26.620 --> 20:33.040
via the USB slot and then you can control your printer remotely.

20:33.040 --> 20:37.500
It is damn near necessary for anybody who's really going to do this as a hobby.

20:37.500 --> 20:42.820
You really need a way to be able to touch your printer without having to walk to it.

20:42.820 --> 20:43.820
Absolutely.

20:43.820 --> 20:44.820
I totally agree.

20:44.820 --> 20:48.860
I have a Pi 4 running my Octopi instance.

20:48.860 --> 20:55.140
So the piece of software is called Octoprint, but the developer of Octoprint makes available

20:55.140 --> 21:00.940
a build for the Raspberry Pi called Octopi, making the Raspberry Pi ecosystem almost synonymous

21:00.940 --> 21:03.260
with 3D printing in my opinion.

21:03.260 --> 21:07.040
And I actually use that to run the Python application, which is Octoprint.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.960
There are a bunch of different plugins you can get.

21:08.960 --> 21:13.420
So for example, I have one that's called Spaghetti Detective, which looks at my webcam feed and

21:13.420 --> 21:19.400
tries to use machine learning to try and figure out if my printers come unstuck for any reason.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.400
That's a fun one.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.140
There's another one that does Telegram integration.

21:22.140 --> 21:26.420
So I get notifications and I can control my printer via Telegram bot.

21:26.420 --> 21:29.260
I can get GIFs as well, all that kind of stuff.

21:29.260 --> 21:30.260
There are hundreds of plugins.

21:30.260 --> 21:31.980
I couldn't possibly list them all.

21:31.980 --> 21:34.060
MQTT is another one.

21:34.060 --> 21:36.420
Yeah, MQTT is awesome.

21:36.420 --> 21:37.980
The time-lapse plugins.

21:37.980 --> 21:39.540
Yes, that one is great.

21:39.540 --> 21:44.140
The webcam plugin, just in general, to let you monitor in real time.

21:44.140 --> 21:46.520
There's even cost estimation plugins.

21:46.520 --> 21:50.820
So based on the G code that you provided, it will estimate how many grams of filament

21:50.820 --> 21:55.060
and how much that filament costs and therefore how much a print's going to cost.

21:55.060 --> 22:00.660
So there are a lot of things in OctoPrint that there's really nothing out there that

22:00.660 --> 22:07.660
compares to it that I've seen, and it's probably one of the best uses for a Raspberry Pi, especially

22:07.660 --> 22:12.220
if you have, well, specifically if you have a 3D printer.

22:12.220 --> 22:13.220
For sure.

22:13.220 --> 22:15.540
Now I would probably suggest running it on a Pi 4.

22:15.540 --> 22:21.420
I've been running it on a Pi 3B Plus for a year or two, but I upgraded about six months

22:21.420 --> 22:24.580
ago to a Pi 4 and it's night and day difference.

22:24.580 --> 22:29.500
It's so much faster, and I would highly recommend a Pi 4 as a baseline if you're just getting

22:29.500 --> 22:30.660
into this.

22:30.660 --> 22:37.220
So a few months ago, everybody from JB came out to Denver and we all had a jolly good

22:37.220 --> 22:44.300
time, but Linode was giving away Raspberry Pis at our little meetup, and I managed to

22:44.300 --> 22:45.660
win one, right?

22:45.660 --> 22:47.300
Yeah, you did.

22:47.300 --> 22:50.140
That's what my Raspberry Pi from Linode is doing.

22:50.140 --> 22:51.140
Awesome.

22:51.140 --> 22:52.140
Rad.

22:52.140 --> 22:58.860
So the final filament I think is worth talking about is TPU, which is a flexible filament.

22:58.860 --> 23:02.060
Have either of you experimented at all with flexies?

23:02.060 --> 23:03.060
Not yet.

23:03.060 --> 23:05.940
Looking forward to it though, but not quite yet.

23:05.940 --> 23:07.340
It's a world of pain.

23:07.340 --> 23:08.340
Not at all.

23:08.340 --> 23:13.740
I mean, I'm familiar with TPU in that I've purchased phone cases before, but as far as

23:13.740 --> 23:16.660
actually making it myself, no, I haven't.

23:16.660 --> 23:21.620
So with the Creality CR-10 I used to have in London, I was printing a lot of drone parts,

23:21.620 --> 23:25.020
as I said, which included stuff like GoPro mounts.

23:25.020 --> 23:28.500
Like I say, when I smashed into a tree, I wanted some give in the parts, so it didn't

23:28.500 --> 23:31.580
just smash into a thousand pieces.

23:31.580 --> 23:36.020
And with the CR-10, it had what's called a Bowden tube extruder, which essentially means

23:36.020 --> 23:41.820
that the gearing, which feeds the filament into the hot end, is on the main body of the

23:41.820 --> 23:47.820
printer connected to the extruder via a plastic or nylon tube.

23:47.820 --> 23:51.100
Whereas the Prusa has what's called a direct drive extruder.

23:51.100 --> 23:56.780
And I've had a lot of success 3D printing with the flexible filaments on the Prusa simply

23:56.780 --> 24:01.840
because there's a lot less chance for a flexible filament to kind of collapse on itself and

24:01.840 --> 24:07.580
start tying itself in knots like spaghetti on the direct drive printers.

24:07.580 --> 24:14.100
Yeah, I haven't had much experience, actually no experience with TPU yet, but from what

24:14.100 --> 24:21.460
I've heard, the direct drive is kind of the way to go for that because, and depending

24:21.460 --> 24:27.120
on the extruder itself, right, the extruder itself can have one gear or multiple gears

24:27.120 --> 24:28.120
in it.

24:28.120 --> 24:34.180
So with multiple gears, you're able to pull filaments that are maybe a little bit more

24:34.180 --> 24:38.820
difficult to pull through and through the hot end and out the nozzle.

24:38.820 --> 24:40.620
So I'm looking forward to it.

24:40.620 --> 24:44.500
I kind of want to print my own phone case, but we'll see.

24:44.500 --> 24:48.620
I don't want to buy a whole roll and then just be sad because I can't print with it

24:48.620 --> 24:51.260
and now I have a whole roll of TPU.

24:51.260 --> 24:57.500
One thing I will say is TPU is incredibly hygroscopic, so just bear that in mind.

24:57.500 --> 25:01.420
There are some more exotic filaments, you know, carbon fiber based ones, but once you

25:01.420 --> 25:07.060
start getting out of those main three that we talked about, so PLA, PETG and TPU, once

25:07.060 --> 25:11.460
you go outside of those three mainstream ones, there are significant compromises to be made

25:11.460 --> 25:13.900
with all the different other plastics that are available.

25:13.900 --> 25:19.020
There are too many for us to get into today, but that's an overview of most entry-level

25:19.020 --> 25:22.900
filaments for most beginners.

25:22.900 --> 25:24.360
Linode.com slash SSH.

25:24.360 --> 25:29.020
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

25:29.020 --> 25:30.020
show.

25:30.020 --> 25:33.300
What I love about Linode, straight up, it's fast, reliable cloud hosting.

25:33.300 --> 25:35.260
You should really go try it for your next project.

25:35.260 --> 25:39.780
It also makes for great R&D if you want to learn something and spin it up super quick.

25:39.780 --> 25:44.380
I guess back in the day, I used to fuss a lot more with VMs on my workstation, but these

25:44.380 --> 25:48.300
days I just jump on the Linode dashboard and I get it going in no time.

25:48.300 --> 25:52.740
One of the things I love is when I'm setting up a system, you can actually get console

25:52.740 --> 25:55.420
access through an SSH session.

25:55.420 --> 25:57.540
They even just give you the command right there in the dashboard.

25:57.540 --> 26:02.420
You highlight that, copy that thing, post it into your terminal, you hit that sucker

26:02.420 --> 26:07.180
button, and then you're actually in an SSH session looking at the console of your Linode

26:07.180 --> 26:08.180
machine.

26:08.180 --> 26:09.180
It's awesome.

26:09.180 --> 26:12.180
It's just those kinds of things that make it fun for when you really want to get down

26:12.180 --> 26:16.620
deep, but they also have the one-click deployments and stuff.

26:16.620 --> 26:18.720
Maybe you want to do a GitLab.

26:18.720 --> 26:19.720
Maybe your own Jitsi server.

26:19.720 --> 26:21.220
Get rid of that Zoom.

26:21.220 --> 26:23.060
One-click deployments for that kind of stuff.

26:23.060 --> 26:27.140
They've been rolling out PCIe MVME storage so things are real nice and fast.

26:27.140 --> 26:30.220
They have 11 data centers around the world, so you're going to find something close to

26:30.220 --> 26:36.620
you or your clients or whoever you want it to be close to, because there's 11 of them.

26:36.620 --> 26:41.380
Linode's been doing this for 18 years, and they just keep dialing it in and making it

26:41.380 --> 26:42.380
better and better.

26:42.380 --> 26:43.860
Go see it for yourself.

26:43.860 --> 26:45.220
Use it for your next project.

26:45.220 --> 26:46.460
Deploy something.

26:46.460 --> 26:48.060
Maybe run a game server up there.

26:48.060 --> 26:50.780
Go have fun and use our promo code and get $100.

26:50.780 --> 26:55.780
It's lino.com.

26:55.780 --> 27:02.340
So then there's a question about, do I need an enclosure to 3D print?

27:02.340 --> 27:07.100
The answer is maybe.

27:07.100 --> 27:12.100
There are a lot of factors that kind of go into it, but the main one is, do you need

27:12.100 --> 27:18.980
to really contain the heat for one, and two, are there environmental variables in the area

27:18.980 --> 27:24.980
that you're going to put your 3D printer that you might benefit from using an enclosure?

27:24.980 --> 27:31.380
And in my particular case, I have lots of pets with lots of loose fur, and that was

27:31.380 --> 27:33.660
the primary reason that I bought one.

27:33.660 --> 27:37.140
I'm pretty sure it saved a number of my prints already.

27:37.140 --> 27:42.580
Yeah, I mean, there's lots of cases I've had where just a single corner has lifted on a

27:42.580 --> 27:47.420
print for no discernibly good reason, and then I realized that the air conditioning kicked

27:47.420 --> 27:52.100
on halfway through that print, and I'm like, huh, I wonder if that draft from that vent

27:52.100 --> 27:57.820
up there was just enough to cause that part to cool down just enough to lift or something.

27:57.820 --> 28:01.580
So yeah, like you say, it's highly dependent on your environment.

28:01.580 --> 28:06.980
It's also highly dependent on the plastic that you're using, so some plastics give off

28:06.980 --> 28:11.760
odors and smells, and sometimes you might want to actually extract those fumes away

28:11.760 --> 28:16.920
from the printer, from the enclosure, but generally speaking, most people run an enclosure

28:16.920 --> 28:22.540
to prevent, like you do, pet hair or dust, or to maintain some kind of temperature for

28:22.540 --> 28:26.020
more finicky plastics like ABS.

28:26.020 --> 28:30.580
I could see it being really valuable to have your printer in an enclosure if, say, you

28:30.580 --> 28:35.420
had your printer in your garage, and the ambient temperature of your garage may shoot down

28:35.420 --> 28:41.940
during the winter, or different variables just in the area in which your printer is.

28:41.940 --> 28:49.340
So I could see there being some uses other than just to help maintain the dust and noise

28:49.340 --> 28:51.740
and fumes of a printer.

28:51.740 --> 28:54.140
Yeah, I totally agree.

28:54.140 --> 28:56.100
Garage is a great shout, particularly in a garage as well.

28:56.100 --> 29:00.460
You're going to end up with a lot of environmental debris in there because they're not as well

29:00.460 --> 29:02.620
sealed as a house, for example.

29:02.620 --> 29:07.340
All right, shall we take a few moments to discuss the various different printers that

29:07.340 --> 29:09.460
we all have and the gear that we've got?

29:09.460 --> 29:10.460
Yeah, let's do it.

29:10.460 --> 29:12.180
Andrew, would you like to go first?

29:12.180 --> 29:14.380
Sure, as the newbie here.

29:14.380 --> 29:23.120
So I bought an Ender 3 Pro, which I then very quickly upgraded various parts of.

29:23.120 --> 29:31.000
One thing that I saw on the Ender 3 subreddit that I really, really enjoy is that when you

29:31.000 --> 29:35.940
buy an Ender, you're not buying a 3D printer, you're buying a do-it-yourself 3D printing

29:35.940 --> 29:36.940
kit.

29:36.940 --> 29:37.940
Yes, you are.

29:37.940 --> 29:38.940
Yes.

29:38.940 --> 29:40.620
That is absolutely so true.

29:40.620 --> 29:44.900
I have replaced a number of things on my printer already.

29:44.900 --> 29:51.780
I went from the Bowden tube setup to a direct drive, and I've also replaced the original

29:51.780 --> 29:58.420
hot end with an all metal one, which is to say the original one had a piece of plastic

29:58.420 --> 30:04.260
tubing that goes all the way down almost to the nozzle to feed the filament.

30:04.260 --> 30:10.100
And the one I replaced it with has a fully metal body so that you don't have the issue

30:10.100 --> 30:14.900
of if you print it too high of a temperature that that tubing starts melting inside the

30:14.900 --> 30:20.460
hot end, which can happen once you start getting into things like PETG.

30:20.460 --> 30:22.220
So I just didn't want to deal with that.

30:22.220 --> 30:25.060
I went ahead and upgraded to the direct drive.

30:25.060 --> 30:30.260
I've also upgraded to what's called auto bed leveling.

30:30.260 --> 30:36.620
So with a normal 3D printer out of the box, typically, at least for the lower end ones,

30:36.620 --> 30:44.020
you have to manually go down there and measure down to the millimeter every corner and adjust

30:44.020 --> 30:50.980
the height so that it is the same distance from the nozzle all across the whole bed.

30:50.980 --> 30:53.740
Potentially every single time you print as well.

30:53.740 --> 30:54.740
Exactly.

30:54.740 --> 30:55.740
Yes.

30:55.740 --> 31:01.900
All the calibrations of the previous print cause your calibrations to be off.

31:01.900 --> 31:08.060
I mentioned I had a CR-10 in London, which I sold before I moved to America, and that

31:08.060 --> 31:09.460
had manual bed leveling on it.

31:09.460 --> 31:12.660
And it was just the most frustrating thing in the world.

31:12.660 --> 31:16.980
You didn't know if it was going to work until the first layer was all completely done.

31:16.980 --> 31:17.980
Right.

31:17.980 --> 31:18.980
Yeah.

31:18.980 --> 31:24.780
So now with the auto bed leveling, it literally will, before print, go through and take measurements

31:24.780 --> 31:28.980
in nine different spots, and you can tune that depending on the firmware you're running.

31:28.980 --> 31:35.200
But on mine, it's nine different spots across the bed, saves that value, and then when it

31:35.200 --> 31:40.540
goes to print, it pulls that value up, shows itself a mesh, and says, okay, this area is

31:40.540 --> 31:43.060
a little lower, so I need to compensate for that.

31:43.060 --> 31:46.340
This area is a little higher, need to compensate for that.

31:46.340 --> 31:51.380
And so it takes something that's not level and essentially adjusts itself to make it

31:51.380 --> 31:52.380
level.

31:52.380 --> 31:53.380
One of the best upgrades.

31:53.380 --> 32:00.380
You have just outlined my primary argument for not buying an Ender, very, very eloquently,

32:00.380 --> 32:02.060
and I appreciate the fact that you did.

32:02.060 --> 32:05.740
I'm curious to know, how much did you spend on it in the first place, and then how much

32:05.740 --> 32:07.380
did you spend on upgrades?

32:07.380 --> 32:08.980
Yeah, I'm curious.

32:08.980 --> 32:15.740
So the original Ender, I found on clearance at Micro Center for 200 bucks.

32:15.740 --> 32:17.420
That's a great price.

32:17.420 --> 32:18.660
Yes, yes it is.

32:18.660 --> 32:25.640
So I snapped that up, and then the upgrade kit with the auto bed leveling, and it also

32:25.640 --> 32:31.140
had the silent board, which is the upgraded V2 board, as well as the V2 screen, which

32:31.140 --> 32:36.200
the V2 is the next version up from the Ender 3 Pro.

32:36.200 --> 32:45.620
So I got all of that for under 100, and then the direct drive was about 60 bucks.

32:45.620 --> 32:55.140
The all metal hot end was about 40, and then I also replaced the cheap brass nozzles that

32:55.140 --> 33:01.400
typically are the things that come with it and that most people buy in packets of 20

33:01.400 --> 33:05.220
because they wear out after three prints, in my opinion.

33:05.220 --> 33:12.200
I replaced that most recently with a Nozzle X, which the nozzle alone was $40.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.420
So far, it is worth every penny.

33:14.420 --> 33:20.900
I'm 60% through my first print with it, and it has had no issues so far.

33:20.900 --> 33:26.220
Fingers crossed it's going to be a great upgrade that outlasts the actual printer.

33:26.220 --> 33:29.660
So all in, I mean, we're talking what, less than 500 bucks?

33:29.660 --> 33:32.420
Yeah, probably around 400 bucks or so.

33:32.420 --> 33:37.100
Yeah, and I feel like I've got a really good machine going now.

33:37.100 --> 33:39.940
Those are some solid bargains, dude.

33:39.940 --> 33:44.160
I think the next time I want to buy something off from Goodwill or something on clearance

33:44.160 --> 33:47.540
or Micro Center, I'm going to deploy Drew to go and find it for me.

33:47.540 --> 33:48.540
That's right.

33:48.540 --> 33:50.340
Deal helm, Drew.

33:50.340 --> 33:52.140
Find any 3D printers wherever you go.

33:52.140 --> 33:53.140
That's right.

33:53.140 --> 33:54.140
I like it.

33:54.140 --> 34:00.320
You know, to be honest, though, Drew, I think that that's probably about the same that I

34:00.320 --> 34:07.020
have into my Ender, somewhere sub 500 bucks, I would say.

34:07.020 --> 34:08.860
So you went with an Ender as well, did you, Cheese?

34:08.860 --> 34:13.920
Yeah, I went with the Ender 3, the Ender 3 Pro.

34:13.920 --> 34:17.260
Probably the same printer as Drew.

34:17.260 --> 34:21.300
I got it for 180 ish on sale through Creality.

34:21.300 --> 34:22.300
Good deal.

34:22.300 --> 34:24.380
I think they're wonderful printers.

34:24.380 --> 34:29.840
If you enjoy tinkering, you don't mind assembling it, you don't mind adjusting it to get it

34:29.840 --> 34:33.340
all dialed in, and you don't mind incrementally upgrading it.

34:33.340 --> 34:38.700
I think that's particularly interesting because I know that you've just bought yourself a

34:38.700 --> 34:39.700
Prusa.

34:39.700 --> 34:40.700
Yes.

34:40.700 --> 34:41.700
Which is something I'm a huge fan of.

34:41.700 --> 34:46.820
And I'm really curious to get your take on someone, you know, besides me, that's just

34:46.820 --> 34:53.580
used both an entry level now and what is considered the Rolls-Royce of FDM printers, the Prusa

34:53.580 --> 34:55.640
i3 Mark III.

34:55.640 --> 35:01.220
I'm curious to know what you think now of now you've used both.

35:01.220 --> 35:03.180
I think there's a place for both.

35:03.180 --> 35:09.700
I think the Ender is great to get started on and see if you like the hobby.

35:09.700 --> 35:15.820
And then I think most people find themselves looking at Prusa or other high end 3D printer

35:15.820 --> 35:21.860
manufacturers for something that is more just kind of turnkey and reliable.

35:21.860 --> 35:23.120
Yeah, 100%.

35:23.120 --> 35:26.620
And that's definitely what I've gotten with the Prusa.

35:26.620 --> 35:35.300
Well let's not forget as well that the Prusas are $750 as a kit and $1,000 pre-built.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.800
So they're twice the price.

35:36.800 --> 35:40.140
They are twice the price.

35:40.140 --> 35:45.260
I just splurged and bought the $1,000 kit, the pre-assembled kit.

35:45.260 --> 35:47.620
It came in obviously pre-assembled.

35:47.620 --> 35:50.460
See, I have strong opinions about this as well.

35:50.460 --> 35:55.760
I think that everybody that's buying a Prusa should, if they have the time and the means,

35:55.760 --> 35:59.620
you know, should go through the process of building it.

35:59.620 --> 36:08.860
Because the first time I built a Prusa, I've built two now, I learned so much about electronics,

36:08.860 --> 36:13.620
about how different screws fit through different things and just quite what 3D printing is

36:13.620 --> 36:19.340
capable of in terms of, you know, part tolerances and the strength of different pillars and

36:19.340 --> 36:21.780
all that kind of stuff that's required.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.180
Highly fascinating procedure.

36:23.180 --> 36:26.740
Yeah, I mean, I think it's worth doing that.

36:26.740 --> 36:28.460
I'm not against that.

36:28.460 --> 36:32.580
But I felt that I had kind of already done that with Ender and I could see that when

36:32.580 --> 36:37.340
I had gotten to the point where I wanted, because I generally don't purchase things

36:37.340 --> 36:41.300
like this for myself or I wanted to have something that was turnkey, right?

36:41.300 --> 36:46.660
So I just wanted to pull it out of the box, set it on the table, plug it in, go through

36:46.660 --> 36:49.540
the initial setup.

36:49.540 --> 36:54.500
Some of the things that you get with the Prusa that you don't get with, say, an Ender, the

36:54.500 --> 36:59.340
Prusa comes with a handbook that goes through everything you need to know about the printer.

36:59.340 --> 37:01.100
It's about as thick as a Bible.

37:01.100 --> 37:02.100
It's amazing.

37:02.100 --> 37:06.860
Yeah, it's a great handbook, great documentation.

37:06.860 --> 37:10.700
Not that you can't find great documentation for an Ender or something like that, probably

37:10.700 --> 37:15.780
not through the vendor, more so through third parties, but there's documentation available

37:15.780 --> 37:16.780
there.

37:16.780 --> 37:22.420
Prusa sets the bar, in my opinion, for documentation, for customer support and also, you know, not

37:22.420 --> 37:28.380
to come across as too much of a fanboy, but everything they do is open source.

37:28.380 --> 37:32.180
The hardware designs, the drawings, everything is open hardware.

37:32.180 --> 37:35.340
It's all based off the original RepRap movement.

37:35.340 --> 37:40.780
It's all designed around 3D printers printing more 3D printers, which is kind of a, it's

37:40.780 --> 37:44.200
machines making machines, so Matrix, watch out.

37:44.200 --> 37:49.500
But in my opinion, as a company, Prusa do so much right.

37:49.500 --> 37:53.980
They're based out of the Czech Republic in Prague, Joseph Prusa is incredibly present

37:53.980 --> 37:54.980
on social media.

37:54.980 --> 37:58.020
He also does a lot of YouTube stuff.

37:58.020 --> 38:02.660
You'll frequently see him on with Joel Telling, he's the 3D printing nerd on YouTube.

38:02.660 --> 38:09.500
And you know, there's so much in my life that is open source, working for Red Hat, obviously

38:09.500 --> 38:15.060
open source is at the core of everything that pays my mortgage and it's been a huge factor

38:15.060 --> 38:19.180
in my personal journey with Linux and everything else.

38:19.180 --> 38:27.540
So the fact that I can also buy a piece of hardware that is totally open, 100% open,

38:27.540 --> 38:34.180
and the vendor has shown a commitment to doing everything open for a decade or so now.

38:34.180 --> 38:40.620
For me, Prusa is just a, you know, I'm a fanboy, I'm going to admit it, but Prusa is pretty

38:40.620 --> 38:42.420
much untouchable in my opinion.

38:42.420 --> 38:49.400
Yeah, I mean, Prusa does a lot of good things, right, they even have their own prints library

38:49.400 --> 38:51.820
similar to Thingiverse.

38:51.820 --> 39:00.460
But in that same vein, the Ender 3 from Creality is open source and open hardware.

39:00.460 --> 39:01.460
The

39:01.460 --> 39:03.420
Only because of Prusa.

39:03.420 --> 39:04.420
Absolutely.

39:04.420 --> 39:05.860
Well, they set a bar, right?

39:05.860 --> 39:06.860
But

39:06.860 --> 39:07.860
And it didn't used to be.

39:07.860 --> 39:13.300
If I recall correctly, it wasn't open and then Creality bowed to public pressure and

39:13.300 --> 39:18.140
eventually released drawings that were of a questionable quality to start with and then

39:18.140 --> 39:19.580
they've improved with time.

39:19.580 --> 39:21.980
Well, I mean, I don't know about that.

39:21.980 --> 39:25.740
I haven't, you know, I'm not here to bash on Creality, but I'm just saying that they

39:25.740 --> 39:30.880
also have open source, their hardware, you know, but I think that it's good to have someone

39:30.880 --> 39:37.520
like Prusa in the market to help push those narratives and to help push the way that things

39:37.520 --> 39:39.940
should maybe be conducted in an ecosystem, right?

39:39.940 --> 39:45.340
So by making these things open hardware and encouraging others to do so, I think it's

39:45.340 --> 39:47.260
awesome.

39:47.260 --> 39:52.660
I think I look at this through the lens of drone racing, where there's an awful lot of

39:52.660 --> 39:57.540
commodity parts put together onto flight controllers and things like that.

39:57.540 --> 40:01.300
And Chinese clones are a real problem in that industry.

40:01.300 --> 40:09.500
You'll have a lot of guys in the West that put a lot of IP into developing specific radios

40:09.500 --> 40:13.860
and flight control algorithms and all this stuff.

40:13.860 --> 40:19.280
And they will put that board out to be made at a factory in China at a decent price.

40:19.280 --> 40:24.540
And then two weeks later, a complete copy clone of that thing is floating around for

40:24.540 --> 40:27.700
half the price on the internet, you know?

40:27.700 --> 40:33.780
And for a while, I kind of felt like Creality were in that similar space of just copying

40:33.780 --> 40:35.340
IP.

40:35.340 --> 40:40.500
They have proven me wrong, I think, in general.

40:40.500 --> 40:46.540
They've done a lot of stuff to open source a lot of their drawings and stuff like that,

40:46.540 --> 40:48.540
but there's still a way for them to go, I think.

40:48.540 --> 40:50.940
Definitely think there's a way for them to go.

40:50.940 --> 40:55.840
I mean, I think there's a way for the entire industry to go as well.

40:55.840 --> 41:02.860
And I think, you know, going back to kind of why I had ended up going from Ender to

41:02.860 --> 41:05.720
Prusa, Prusa has a lot of nice features, right?

41:05.720 --> 41:11.820
It's got auto bed leveling built in with a really accurate probe.

41:11.820 --> 41:20.660
It's got a really nice bed that comes with it and the steel sheet to put on the bed.

41:20.660 --> 41:23.780
And Drew had mentioned earlier that it draws a mesh, essentially.

41:23.780 --> 41:30.660
So mind you, all of these printers, regardless of which one it is, the bed is not going to

41:30.660 --> 41:33.820
be manufactured perfectly true.

41:33.820 --> 41:35.660
It's basically impossible for that to happen.

41:35.660 --> 41:41.100
That's why you see people use mirrors on their 3D printers is because mirrors are generally

41:41.100 --> 41:44.140
more true than a piece of glass.

41:44.140 --> 41:49.100
Because if you had a mirror that wasn't true or flat, then you would have a funhouse mirror.

41:49.100 --> 41:52.860
And I don't think, you know, everyone wants to wake up in the morning staring at a funhouse

41:52.860 --> 41:55.220
version of themselves while they brush their teeth.

41:55.220 --> 41:59.660
So there are a lot of nice features that come with the Prusa.

41:59.660 --> 42:06.880
You get the direct drive extruder, which you can also love this feature, remove the filament.

42:06.880 --> 42:11.440
So instead of, say, with my Ender, I would heat up the hot end and then just yank the

42:11.440 --> 42:13.560
filament out.

42:13.560 --> 42:18.380
With the Prusa, it will heat up the hot end and then reverse the drive gears in the extruder

42:18.380 --> 42:19.760
to pull the filament out.

42:19.760 --> 42:22.100
And I just pulled the filament out of the top of the extruder.

42:22.100 --> 42:23.660
It's pretty nice.

42:23.660 --> 42:24.660
Super nice.

42:24.660 --> 42:26.200
Super clean.

42:26.200 --> 42:31.920
The steppers and the drivers for the motors or the steppers themselves and the drivers

42:31.920 --> 42:33.420
for them are super quiet.

42:33.420 --> 42:37.260
I hear the fans more than I hear the motors, which wasn't true.

42:37.260 --> 42:42.260
And I'm sure, Drew, you can attest to this that the original Ender board that you had

42:42.260 --> 42:49.140
in your Ender 3, the sound from whenever you upgraded from the original board to the version

42:49.140 --> 42:52.460
2, just the drivers for the motors.

42:52.460 --> 42:54.980
Dude, it's night and day.

42:54.980 --> 42:55.980
Reduced.

42:55.980 --> 42:56.980
Absolutely.

42:56.980 --> 43:00.820
Yeah, it's ridiculous how loud the Ender 3 Pro is out of the box.

43:00.820 --> 43:06.640
So let me ask you both, what kind of stuff do you print these days?

43:06.640 --> 43:12.500
So I've been printing lately things like cases and stands for various items that need them

43:12.500 --> 43:18.740
around the house, some things for some musical instruments and things of that nature.

43:18.740 --> 43:24.760
My wife and I, when we first started getting into 3D printing, part of the goal was to

43:24.760 --> 43:34.660
design things, print them, and then use her Cricut maker to print vinyl, which could then

43:34.660 --> 43:41.740
be 2D printed to have her designs on them and then go on to the 3D objects to sell through

43:41.740 --> 43:42.740
her store.

43:42.740 --> 43:44.000
That's very cool.

43:44.000 --> 43:47.140
So that's coming.

43:47.140 --> 43:52.220
We both need a little more experience with our individual parts, like I need to get a

43:52.220 --> 43:53.220
little better.

43:53.220 --> 43:58.840
I haven't designed anything yet as far as 3D printing is concerned.

43:58.840 --> 44:00.640
That's the next level up, right?

44:00.640 --> 44:02.660
That's a whole nother bowl game, man.

44:02.660 --> 44:03.660
Absolutely.

44:03.660 --> 44:08.400
I'm getting used to making the filament do what I want it to do before I try to make

44:08.400 --> 44:12.060
it do stuff that we're going to sell.

44:12.060 --> 44:15.660
Understandable, absolutely.

44:15.660 --> 44:22.100
For me, I've been printing, well, shortly after, I would say maybe four months after

44:22.100 --> 44:31.060
we got our printer, COVID hit, and like many makers at the time, Alex, I know you're one,

44:31.060 --> 44:35.900
and had encouraged me to get onto the bandwagon as well, started pitching in and making face

44:35.900 --> 44:42.960
masks or shields using our 3D printers and some other materials.

44:42.960 --> 44:48.620
So I spent a lot of time doing that, printed a ton of those for schools and nurseries and

44:48.620 --> 44:51.380
random public places.

44:51.380 --> 44:55.300
But I enjoy printing cases, little electronics projects.

44:55.300 --> 45:02.620
I think after seeing your recording sign project and it also got me kind of into microcontrollers

45:02.620 --> 45:05.740
and I think that 3D printing helped kind of drag me there too.

45:05.740 --> 45:15.900
So like I've printed a little project that has a 0.96 inch OLED screen that basically

45:15.900 --> 45:21.020
connects to OctoPrint, tells me the progress of a print, sits on my desk, it's powered

45:21.020 --> 45:22.740
by five volts.

45:22.740 --> 45:29.080
Just recently finished printing a case for a stream deck that I'm planning on making

45:29.080 --> 45:38.300
using a Arduino Pro Micro, some sliders and actually some of the Jade switches that are

45:38.300 --> 45:42.260
left over from the launch keyboards.

45:42.260 --> 45:49.680
Sometimes in our shipment of switches we get bent pins and so we have like a bent pin bucket.

45:49.680 --> 45:54.800
So I raided the bent pin bucket and found some switches to include in the project.

45:54.800 --> 45:56.940
So looking forward to getting that one done.

45:56.940 --> 46:03.340
But I think as you start with the hobby you find just things that you can print online,

46:03.340 --> 46:10.280
things that are useful, then you drift into kind of designing things and the next thing

46:10.280 --> 46:14.420
you know you're just absolved in it I guess.

46:14.420 --> 46:17.660
It's kind of like a drug addiction to some extent, right?

46:17.660 --> 46:20.500
Maybe a drug addiction would be cheaper at times.

46:20.500 --> 46:21.500
At times.

46:21.500 --> 46:22.500
I mean at times, right?

46:22.500 --> 46:23.500
Maybe.

46:23.500 --> 46:24.500
Maybe.

46:24.500 --> 46:30.580
I mean I wouldn't imagine over the long term, maybe short term, but like Drew said, buying

46:30.580 --> 46:34.620
the upgrades and upgrading the thing, you just kind of get into this something I don't

46:34.620 --> 46:35.620
know what it is.

46:35.620 --> 46:40.900
It's like this thing that just pulls you forward to like let's make all of the things.

46:40.900 --> 46:48.460
How can I just make this myself instead of just being a consumer and just grabbing the

46:48.460 --> 46:54.100
first thing off the shelf that kind of fits your needs or solves your problem.

46:54.100 --> 46:58.220
It's nice to be able to actually make something yourself to solve that problem.

46:58.220 --> 46:59.220
Totally agree.

46:59.220 --> 47:00.860
An example of that in my life recently.

47:00.860 --> 47:05.240
My daughter recently figured out how to crawl and so obviously we started needing to baby

47:05.240 --> 47:11.260
proof the house so I've printed corner protectors for you know things like coffee tables and

47:11.260 --> 47:15.020
the outlet prong protector things.

47:15.020 --> 47:17.060
All sorts of little things like that you know.

47:17.060 --> 47:20.580
Have you printed any little door locks for like under the cabinet?

47:20.580 --> 47:23.940
No, but I think I will need to pretty soon.

47:23.940 --> 47:29.740
I do a lot of stuff like shelf brackets and little widgets to help me you know in the

47:29.740 --> 47:33.900
workshop when I'm doing woodworking that kind of stuff like little templates and routing

47:33.900 --> 47:38.580
guides and jigs that kind of thing.

47:38.580 --> 47:41.620
There's just so many little things you can do with it.

47:41.620 --> 47:48.700
There's a great subreddit called r-slash-functional-print and there's all sorts of great stuff on there.

47:48.700 --> 47:54.220
So if you're struggling for inspiration, take a look at that subreddit.

47:54.220 --> 48:00.500
Have you guys on the note of all of these printers and Alex I'm sure you guys have,

48:00.500 --> 48:05.340
Drew have you had a chance to see the new Prusa XL printer?

48:05.340 --> 48:06.340
That's a big boy.

48:06.340 --> 48:07.340
I have not.

48:07.340 --> 48:09.340
How big is it?

48:09.340 --> 48:10.340
It's XL.

48:10.340 --> 48:20.340
It's not double XL but it's XL but it also has automatic extruder tool head changes.

48:20.340 --> 48:24.420
So you can have multiple filaments loaded like I think it's five filaments loaded at

48:24.420 --> 48:30.820
a time and it will just pick the head and pull the hot end and head.

48:30.820 --> 48:37.620
Typically a Prusa is nine inches tall by eight inches front to back and left to right.

48:37.620 --> 48:45.260
The Prusa XL is 14 inches square, that's its build volume is front to back left to right

48:45.260 --> 48:53.200
up down 14 inches so significantly larger and in order to do that they're charging $2,000

48:53.200 --> 48:55.540
as a starting point for this printer.

48:55.540 --> 48:59.400
Bear in mind a normal Prusa starts at $750 and they've got the Prusa Mini as well which

48:59.400 --> 49:05.180
starts at $300, $400 something like that to compete with the Enders.

49:05.180 --> 49:10.380
But like Cheez says, the really cool game-changing feature that they've got on this new Prusa

49:10.380 --> 49:15.060
XL, it's not just the fact that they're changing the heads or anything, they're changing the

49:15.060 --> 49:16.420
whole tool.

49:16.420 --> 49:21.020
So it's five separate, you can have up to five separate extruders on this thing.

49:21.020 --> 49:25.360
So you could 3D print five completely different materials.

49:25.360 --> 49:30.020
So you could have dissolvable filaments, soluble filaments to do supports for example that

49:30.020 --> 49:33.540
you could then submerge your print and they would just dissolve.

49:33.540 --> 49:37.140
So there's all sorts of really interesting different applications you could use for that

49:37.140 --> 49:38.140
one.

49:38.140 --> 49:41.860
And it has a really neat new bed technology.

49:41.860 --> 49:46.900
The way that they've segmented the bed, so instead of it just being a flat bed, they've

49:46.900 --> 49:52.300
segmented the beds leaving like cooling and expansion channels in between so that as the

49:52.300 --> 50:00.620
print, as the bed heats up and expands and contracts, you'll be less likely to have warpages

50:00.620 --> 50:03.580
on the bottom of your prints where they're adhering to the bed and stuff.

50:03.580 --> 50:09.780
A lot of cool new tech definitely coming out from Prusa, which I think is going to set

50:09.780 --> 50:17.700
the bar for everyone else going forward and hopefully we'll continue to do this ourselves

50:17.700 --> 50:20.340
and next year we'll sit down and see where we are.

50:20.340 --> 50:26.740
But I did have a couple of questions for you Alex and Drew as well.

50:26.740 --> 50:32.420
Do you guys weigh your filament before you put a print together?

50:32.420 --> 50:37.100
So if you know that you're going to have an extended print, do you weigh the filament

50:37.100 --> 50:42.860
that's on the roll before you load it into your printer to make sure you have enough

50:42.860 --> 50:47.060
filament or do you just cross your fingers and hope that you have enough filament?

50:47.060 --> 50:50.460
I do the cross and clench method, yeah.

50:50.460 --> 50:53.660
The Prusa has a filament run out sensor so I'm not too worried.

50:53.660 --> 50:59.820
Yeah, my upgrade kit also came with a filament run out sensor which I haven't actually installed

50:59.820 --> 51:00.820
yet.

51:00.820 --> 51:07.940
I need to do that but I also haven't gone through enough filament yet to really make

51:07.940 --> 51:10.340
it necessary as of now.

51:10.340 --> 51:13.460
Got you, got you.

51:13.460 --> 51:15.700
But I mean do you weigh your filament?

51:15.700 --> 51:19.500
How do you measure to know if you have enough filament on a roll to complete a print?

51:19.500 --> 51:22.340
Do you just do the same method, just the cross and clench method?

51:22.340 --> 51:23.340
Yeah, pretty much.

51:23.340 --> 51:24.340
Yeah, eyeballing.

51:24.340 --> 51:30.380
You're like, that's roughly half a roll, we can roughly get this much out of it.

51:30.380 --> 51:34.820
Well, I haven't gone even through half a roll of any of my individual rolls yet.

51:34.820 --> 51:40.060
I've got like eight different rolls of filament sitting around and I've kind of played with

51:40.060 --> 51:42.820
each of them so far, you know.

51:42.820 --> 51:48.220
If you consider that each roll of filament is a kilo, typically it's a kilogram, that's

51:48.220 --> 51:49.220
a lot of plastic.

51:49.220 --> 51:54.020
So you'd be printing something pretty massive in order to go through an entire roll in a

51:54.020 --> 51:55.020
single print.

51:55.020 --> 51:56.020
Yeah.

51:56.020 --> 51:58.780
I think where it matters more is where you're trying to use up the dregs, for example.

51:58.780 --> 52:01.060
Absolutely, and that's why I'd asked, yeah.

52:01.060 --> 52:05.580
I got pretty good when I was doing the mask making that you referenced when COVID first

52:05.580 --> 52:07.740
started, kind of doing like a hot swap.

52:07.740 --> 52:12.420
I would sort of sit, you know, a printer's next to me on my desk, I'd sit and watch it

52:12.420 --> 52:17.300
and then I would have the second spool ready and I just sort of get a lighter and fuse

52:17.300 --> 52:21.260
it together really roughly and then sort of file it down a little bit and sort of show

52:21.260 --> 52:27.860
it and it would be fine, it would jam occasionally, but most of the time it was fine.

52:27.860 --> 52:29.100
I never thought of that.

52:29.100 --> 52:33.740
Whilst doing that I would do the same, but I would just watch OctoPrint and then hit

52:33.740 --> 52:34.740
pause.

52:34.740 --> 52:36.740
You could do that, that's probably safer.

52:36.740 --> 52:38.140
And then just swap the filament out real quick.

52:38.140 --> 52:40.100
That's probably safer.

52:40.100 --> 52:44.380
I never thought of, I mean that's a good way to do that, I mean I guess you could potentially

52:44.380 --> 52:45.380
introduce clogs, but.

52:45.380 --> 52:49.540
I could potentially burn my house down, but apart from that.

52:49.540 --> 52:53.780
I mean only, you know, the nozzles are only a few cents each if you get the cheap brass

52:53.780 --> 52:57.900
ones that Drew had mentioned earlier.

52:57.900 --> 52:58.900
What about maintenance?

52:58.900 --> 53:02.340
What do you guys do for maintenance on your printers?

53:02.340 --> 53:06.620
There is an excellent video by a Welsh guy on YouTube whose name escapes me, but I'll

53:06.620 --> 53:11.380
put a link to it in the show notes, where he talks through dismantling a Prusa for example

53:11.380 --> 53:14.380
and all the different oils that you need to put on various different parts and what have

53:14.380 --> 53:15.580
you.

53:15.580 --> 53:19.460
I tend to do it on an annual basis or as often as I can be bothered.

53:19.460 --> 53:22.140
It really depends how much you're printing, how many hours a day you're printing, that

53:22.140 --> 53:23.340
kind of thing.

53:23.340 --> 53:28.900
My printer sits idle much more than it's printing to be perfectly honest, so I don't feel the

53:28.900 --> 53:31.700
need to do quite so much maintenance.

53:31.700 --> 53:35.620
But if I was running a print farm or something I would definitely put it as part of a regular

53:35.620 --> 53:36.620
regime.

53:36.620 --> 53:37.620
Gotcha.

53:37.620 --> 53:38.620
What about you Drew?

53:38.620 --> 53:43.500
I don't imagine you've done much since you haven't had a printer too long, but what kind

53:43.500 --> 53:44.860
of maintenance do you do?

53:44.860 --> 53:50.940
As far as the printer maintenance that Alex is talking about, I haven't done any.

53:50.940 --> 54:00.100
However, once a week or so if I have an issue that I notice, like the x-axis is a little

54:00.100 --> 54:07.000
wonky on a print, I'll go through and I'll check the belts, spot checking various things.

54:07.000 --> 54:11.420
One thing I will say is after every print I will go through with a microfiber cloth

54:11.420 --> 54:17.540
and just wipe down the bed, wipe off the nozzle, make sure that everything's clean and ready

54:17.540 --> 54:20.300
for the next time I go to print.

54:20.300 --> 54:25.740
That is one thing that I would say is well worth doing is just having something around

54:25.740 --> 54:30.420
to just wipe down the bed and wipe down the nozzle at the very least every time you do

54:30.420 --> 54:32.180
a print.

54:32.180 --> 54:37.900
Just because you can get stuff that maybe attaches to the nozzle, although it's less

54:37.900 --> 54:43.980
of a problem if you have one of the nicer nozzles than it is with brass, but still it's

54:43.980 --> 54:49.780
good practice to clean up after yourself in your workspace.

54:49.780 --> 54:54.340
I would say that I do that as well every time I have like a little spray bottle of isopropyl

54:54.340 --> 55:00.660
alcohol and a microfiber cloth that I just spray down and wipe the bed every time I finish

55:00.660 --> 55:01.660
with the print.

55:01.660 --> 55:06.740
I used to spray mine down, but now with the PETG because I am printing on tempered glass,

55:06.740 --> 55:09.420
I do use glue stick.

55:09.420 --> 55:11.460
So I tend to leave the glue stick.

55:11.460 --> 55:14.740
I don't wipe that down after every use.

55:14.740 --> 55:20.780
I'll do a number of prints before I go through and wash it off and reapply.

55:20.780 --> 55:24.580
That's one of the beautiful things about the Prusa though is I can't remember the last

55:24.580 --> 55:27.140
time I cleaned my bed.

55:27.140 --> 55:32.100
Maybe that's bad, but it just works every time.

55:32.100 --> 55:36.180
I'm looking forward to that, but I'll probably still clean my bed every single time I print

55:36.180 --> 55:37.180
something.

55:37.180 --> 55:38.180
It's a habit, dude.

55:38.180 --> 55:39.180
I just can't not.

55:39.180 --> 55:44.940
I used to just out of habit from the CR-10 that I had, but eventually I just stopped

55:44.940 --> 55:51.140
and whilst I was doing the masks, I got pretty good at figuring out what was actually needed

55:51.140 --> 55:56.900
versus what the internet told me I needed to do.

55:56.900 --> 56:02.500
Generally speaking, as long as your house isn't in the desert full of dust, you should

56:02.500 --> 56:05.920
be fine with just the occasional wipe down.

56:05.920 --> 56:11.860
When I say clean, all I really mean is literally taking a microfiber cloth, running it across

56:11.860 --> 56:17.700
the bed, running it across the nozzle, job done.

56:17.700 --> 56:21.660
We're not talking about you have to get in there and scrub every nook and cranny or anything

56:21.660 --> 56:22.660
like that.

56:22.660 --> 56:23.660
No.

56:23.660 --> 56:29.100
I had to do that on my glass bed with the Creality that I had.

56:29.100 --> 56:34.020
Take some dish soap and wash it with love and care and affection and then never touch

56:34.020 --> 56:36.500
it and get my – it was just a pain in the ass.

56:36.500 --> 56:37.780
After every print.

56:37.780 --> 56:38.780
Pretty much, yeah.

56:38.780 --> 56:39.780
Oh, God.

56:39.780 --> 56:40.780
Wow.

56:40.780 --> 56:41.780
That's horrible.

56:41.780 --> 56:44.780
Bear in mind, this was like four years ago before things have come on a bit of a way

56:44.780 --> 56:45.780
since then.

56:45.780 --> 56:46.780
That's fair.

56:46.780 --> 56:47.780
Yeah.

56:47.780 --> 56:50.820
I mean, for anybody listening, if you're getting into it and you want to take my route

56:50.820 --> 56:56.140
where you're kind of spending a little less money and doing some DIY upgrades, go get

56:56.140 --> 57:00.980
yourself some decent quality glue stick.

57:00.980 --> 57:01.980
It makes a world of difference.

57:01.980 --> 57:02.980
It really does.

57:02.980 --> 57:03.980
100%.

57:03.980 --> 57:06.500
Now, thank you both for joining.

57:06.500 --> 57:11.340
I really appreciate you taking the time out of your schedules to come and talk to us today.

57:11.340 --> 57:14.100
Is there any way you'd like to send people to follow you or anything?

57:14.100 --> 57:21.660
I mean, you can follow me on Twitter at Cheese Bacon, that's C-H-C-B-A-C-O-N.

57:21.660 --> 57:25.540
If you have any questions or just want to talk shop, feel free to reach out.

57:25.540 --> 57:27.100
My DMs are open.

57:27.100 --> 57:28.100
Yep.

57:28.100 --> 57:30.540
Same here, Drew of Doom on Twitter.

57:30.540 --> 57:31.540
Feel free to reach out.

57:31.540 --> 57:33.220
Well, thank you both very much.

57:33.220 --> 57:34.220
Thank you for having me, man.

57:34.220 --> 57:35.220
Yeah.

57:35.220 --> 57:36.220
Thank you.

57:36.220 --> 57:38.740
Maybe 2022 will be the year that I finally get a 3D printer.

57:38.740 --> 57:40.140
I know my kids would love it.

57:40.140 --> 57:44.660
And then I know I'd start printing stuff for my RV all the time.

57:44.660 --> 57:48.500
I want to say a special holiday thank you to our members over at selfhosted.show slash

57:48.500 --> 57:51.920
S-R-E. You make this show possible.

57:51.920 --> 57:54.760
Don't forget you also get the extra post show.

57:54.760 --> 58:02.340
And we now, after a lot of, I guess the term is popular demand, as they say, we now have

58:02.340 --> 58:05.420
a network membership at Jupiter.party.

58:05.420 --> 58:07.740
You can gift it as well.

58:07.740 --> 58:09.900
We'll have that for a little bit longer.

58:09.900 --> 58:13.940
And also till the end of December, if you sign up, we're taking two bucks off.

58:13.940 --> 58:17.300
So normally the membership is just the cost of two memberships, but you get access to

58:17.300 --> 58:23.260
all the show special stuff, all the goodies, the behind the scenes stuff and love the member

58:23.260 --> 58:29.820
stuff that you get only with self hosteds, member show, the coder QA, all that and Linux

58:29.820 --> 58:36.020
action news, totally ad free and any new content we add as well for just the price of two memberships.

58:36.020 --> 58:41.020
But right now, until the end of the month of December, we're taking two bucks off for

58:41.020 --> 58:42.540
a year.

58:42.540 --> 58:48.820
This membership is designed to let us be picky, to make sure we choose the right sponsors.

58:48.820 --> 58:54.100
We get a lot of emails that come in and we don't want to be in a position where we have

58:54.100 --> 58:58.180
to work with a sponsor that we don't actively believe in.

58:58.180 --> 58:59.620
And this lets us be picky.

58:59.620 --> 59:04.340
It gives us runway because these good sponsorship deals, they don't happen overnight.

59:04.340 --> 59:06.500
They take months to develop a relationship.

59:06.500 --> 59:08.640
You give us the runway to do that.

59:08.640 --> 59:13.140
The episodes where there's fewer sponsorships, those are the episodes our members actually

59:13.140 --> 59:15.700
make possible too.

59:15.700 --> 59:21.140
So it's a pretty special thing and it puts you in the driver's seat because you're funding

59:21.140 --> 59:23.500
the content and that's fundamental.

59:23.500 --> 59:25.980
That changes everything.

59:25.980 --> 59:30.300
Jupiter.party if you'd like to be a member for the entire network or selfhosted.show

59:30.300 --> 59:34.100
slash SRE if you'd like to be a member just for this show.

59:34.100 --> 59:38.380
And even if you can't support us through a membership, we are so grateful for your downloads,

59:38.380 --> 59:43.300
for your community support, for maybe telling a friend, maybe leaving a review somewhere.

59:43.300 --> 59:47.580
So happy holidays from the self-hosted team and feel free to reach out to us at selfhosted.show

59:47.580 --> 01:00:17.180
