WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:03.500
Coming up on today's show, we have good news, everyone.

00:04.140 --> 00:08.220
I check out Lychee's latest release and Chris licks a stamp and sends it.

00:08.520 --> 00:09.140
All of it.

00:09.580 --> 00:10.220
I'm Alex.

00:10.580 --> 00:13.020
I'm Chris, and this is Self-Hosted 27.

00:14.300 --> 00:18.240
Episode 27 feels like a lucky one, Alex, because around the time this comes out,

00:18.240 --> 00:19.740
it'll be our one year anniversary.

00:19.980 --> 00:22.140
Happy birthday to us.

00:23.900 --> 00:24.820
Can you believe it?

00:25.180 --> 00:27.660
I mean, in some ways it feels like we've been doing this forever.

00:27.660 --> 00:29.420
In some ways it feels like it's been six months.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.020
God, they grow up so fast, don't they?

00:31.860 --> 00:32.920
You know what else this means?

00:32.920 --> 00:36.060
It means it was a year since you and I went to see Wendell.

00:36.360 --> 00:36.940
Right.

00:37.020 --> 00:37.820
On that road trip.

00:38.020 --> 00:39.140
What a different world it was.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.940
I could use a nice road trip like that.

00:41.060 --> 00:41.940
Me too.

00:42.860 --> 00:44.400
Well, we have a lot to talk about.

00:44.420 --> 00:46.460
I'm going to try to convince you to adopt something.

00:46.460 --> 00:49.980
So let me start by saying thank you to a cloud guru for sponsoring this episode.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.780
If you're looking to make a high paying career move into the cloud, no better

00:53.780 --> 00:55.740
place to start than a certification.

00:55.740 --> 01:00.180
ACG has helped more than 2 million people skill up on cloud, AWS, Azure,

01:00.220 --> 01:01.900
GCP exam preps also available.

01:01.900 --> 01:02.900
They've got you covered.

01:03.220 --> 01:05.460
Get going at a cloud guru.com.

01:06.340 --> 01:11.540
Alex, as we record this show, some people may know this, others may not, but a cloud

01:11.540 --> 01:15.020
guru and Jupiter Broadcasting have made a mutual decision to separate and restore

01:15.020 --> 01:17.460
Jupiter Broadcasting's independent media status.

01:18.140 --> 01:21.700
This de-merger will allow Jupiter Broadcasting and a cloud guru to dedicate

01:21.700 --> 01:25.020
their resources to specialize in content they do best.

01:25.020 --> 01:29.460
Jupiter Broadcasting in creating Linux and open source podcasts, content catered

01:29.460 --> 01:34.100
to enthusiasts and industry professionals, and a cloud guru in creating comprehensive

01:34.100 --> 01:36.060
hands-on multi-cloud computing.

01:36.340 --> 01:38.740
Linux and DevOps training for businesses and individuals.

01:39.060 --> 01:43.100
A cloud guru and Jupiter Broadcasting share many commonalities such as a passion

01:43.100 --> 01:46.860
we have for our respective missions and an investment we make in creating

01:46.860 --> 01:50.900
accessible, accurate, and engaging content that makes a difference to our audience.

01:51.620 --> 01:54.420
We also share a belief in the importance of giving back to the open source

01:54.420 --> 01:57.780
community, as such a cloud guru will continue its support of Jupiter

01:57.780 --> 02:01.300
Broadcasting with a sponsorship arrangement, and we'll continue to explore

02:01.300 --> 02:03.460
future content collaboration opportunities.

02:03.940 --> 02:06.140
So we are an independent company again.

02:06.140 --> 02:09.780
And as part of that, we have been rolling out some new shows.

02:09.780 --> 02:11.620
Linux Action News just relaunched.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.300
I'm very excited about that.

02:13.620 --> 02:14.140
So am I.

02:14.220 --> 02:18.820
That was one of my favorite ways of just, you know, dipping my toe into the pool

02:18.820 --> 02:20.060
of Linux news every week.

02:21.220 --> 02:22.100
That's a funny visual.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.660
And then Coder Radio also just relaunched.

02:24.660 --> 02:26.220
We just recorded our second episode.

02:26.540 --> 02:28.900
So that's out right about now as well.

02:29.060 --> 02:30.420
What's funny about my toes?

02:31.140 --> 02:34.300
It's not so much that it's like the Linux news pool and what that might actually

02:34.300 --> 02:34.820
look like.

02:35.460 --> 02:41.540
I'm picturing a pool with a lot of algae, you know, a really gross one that needs

02:41.540 --> 02:42.740
to be washed a little bit.

02:43.660 --> 02:45.420
Maybe some ducks came and crapped in it.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.180
I'm staying out of this.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.180
You're going to have to find a shovel, man.

02:49.740 --> 02:50.420
I just love it.

02:50.420 --> 02:55.260
I just, the Linux people know I love, so I get to have a little bit of fun as part

02:55.260 --> 02:57.140
of this transition to independent.

02:57.300 --> 03:00.740
Some of our shows are launching membership feeds.

03:01.380 --> 03:04.140
Predominantly, these are limited ad feeds that will have some

03:04.140 --> 03:05.660
additional value as well.

03:05.980 --> 03:09.460
The idea being is that we want to help for production of the shows

03:09.460 --> 03:10.780
and keep them sustainable.

03:11.540 --> 03:16.300
Jupiter Broadcasting will live and die on the success of some of the multiple

03:16.300 --> 03:18.140
sources of income that I can come up with.

03:18.140 --> 03:21.700
And so the idea being is we don't want the only way we live and die being

03:21.700 --> 03:24.500
sponsorships, we're very grateful for our sponsorships.

03:24.500 --> 03:29.220
And if you can't afford to be a member or a member of all of our shows, that's

03:29.220 --> 03:33.740
fine, just, we appreciate you listening and engaging with a sponsor if it seems

03:33.740 --> 03:39.700
like an appropriate fit, if you can't afford to support the show and you want

03:39.700 --> 03:45.100
to help keep us going, and in addition to getting a limited ad version of the show,

03:45.100 --> 03:48.820
you will also get a bonus post-show, we'll include the bonus post-show

03:48.820 --> 03:51.140
that isn't included anywhere else.

03:51.900 --> 03:55.860
If you want to join us, we have a limited time code and we've come up with a name

03:55.860 --> 03:57.460
for the team that we think is pretty great.

03:57.460 --> 04:02.460
It's going to be the Self-Hosted Site Reliability Engineers.

04:02.460 --> 04:06.180
So you go to selfhosted.show slash SRE to sign up.

04:06.460 --> 04:08.940
It is $5 a month.

04:09.140 --> 04:14.300
And if you use the code SSH, we'll take a dollar off indefinitely.

04:14.300 --> 04:16.540
So it's $4 a month indefinitely.

04:16.940 --> 04:21.740
If you use the promo code SSH at self-hosted.show slash SRE, you become

04:21.740 --> 04:24.140
a site reliability engineer for the show.

04:24.340 --> 04:25.900
You get a limited ad version of the show.

04:25.900 --> 04:30.780
Plus you also get the post-show included with that one feed and you just subscribe

04:30.780 --> 04:34.380
to that and that's your version of the show fully produced, just limited ads,

04:34.740 --> 04:37.820
the post-show just for you and you help keep us going.

04:37.820 --> 04:39.180
It's $5 right now.

04:39.460 --> 04:43.860
You might want to get in on that because if for some reason in the future,

04:43.860 --> 04:47.980
in the, in, you know, in year two of this show or something, we decided to go to

04:47.980 --> 04:52.180
weekly, we'd probably bring the membership price up to help cover that cost.

04:52.500 --> 04:57.420
So you might want to lock that price in while you can at self-hosted.show slash SRE.

04:57.620 --> 05:00.020
Thank you to everybody who is in a position to support us there.

05:00.820 --> 05:04.580
And if you can't, your support by listening, sharing the show with someone

05:04.580 --> 05:08.340
you like, or engaging in those sponsors is all the thanks we need.

05:08.380 --> 05:09.460
And we appreciate that too.

05:09.860 --> 05:10.300
Absolutely.

05:10.300 --> 05:14.420
I couldn't be more delighted in the news that JB is independent again.

05:14.420 --> 05:16.540
I think that's fantastic for everybody involved.

05:16.540 --> 05:21.420
So, uh, I thank anybody in advance that sees fit to throw a bone or two, are we?

05:21.660 --> 05:24.780
Thank you, Alex too, because you know, it's doing these shows is what makes it

05:24.780 --> 05:28.580
possible and it just means this is, this is my full-time thing now.

05:28.580 --> 05:29.660
It's a lot right now.

05:30.060 --> 05:33.700
Like honestly, it's overwhelming at the moment and it's touch and go.

05:34.020 --> 05:37.220
I don't know if we'll make it the next three months and I don't know if we'll

05:37.220 --> 05:38.380
make it six months after that.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.300
I'm hopeful, but it is really quite touch and go.

05:41.300 --> 05:44.540
And I know it's touch and go for a lot of people out there, but I'm hoping

05:44.540 --> 05:48.660
these memberships not only give us like a little additional runway.

05:48.660 --> 05:51.460
So if maybe a week, we don't have a sponsor, we can still cover the

05:51.460 --> 05:53.700
cost of running the show that'd be ideal.

05:54.060 --> 05:58.940
But additionally, maybe it can go towards paying the hosts a little bit of beer

05:58.940 --> 06:02.220
money for doing the show, which I think would be really, that's, that's my kind

06:02.220 --> 06:05.660
of hope, I don't think it's going to make us millionaires, but I hope it covers

06:05.660 --> 06:09.340
the cost of an editor and maybe gives you and I a little beer money, you know?

06:09.380 --> 06:10.060
Wouldn't that be nice?

06:10.380 --> 06:13.980
Reminds me of only fools and horses in the UK to watch as a kid.

06:14.140 --> 06:19.580
And David Jason was one day Rogers will be millionaires.

06:19.900 --> 06:22.460
That won't mean anything to you, but to anybody from England will

06:22.460 --> 06:23.700
know exactly what I'm talking about.

06:23.980 --> 06:26.060
No, but I'm going to, I'm over here scratching my lottery tickets.

06:26.060 --> 06:26.300
Sorry.

06:26.300 --> 06:26.700
What was that?

06:28.820 --> 06:34.580
I kid, but also I do have something in the works for like a, um, a bundle for

06:34.580 --> 06:39.580
the network, if this isn't for you yet, or you want everything, stay tuned.

06:39.620 --> 06:41.980
There will probably be upgrade options or something like that as well.

06:41.980 --> 06:46.860
But I do have some ideas around that to try to give everybody one bundle package

06:46.860 --> 06:49.980
you could get and you get all the shows feeds and all of that, but that's in the

06:49.980 --> 06:53.180
works, we'll have more information about that in the meantime, self hosted that

06:53.180 --> 06:55.980
show slash SRE, it's a new beginning.

06:55.980 --> 06:59.780
It's, it's fun and kind of coincidental that it's right here at the year.

06:59.780 --> 07:00.300
Mark too.

07:00.700 --> 07:03.220
Do we start playing 2001 space Odyssey now?

07:03.220 --> 07:04.940
I haven't been thinking about it more and more.

07:04.940 --> 07:09.980
Actually, I have a project for you, Chris, and it has a name

07:09.980 --> 07:11.580
with questionable pronunciation.

07:11.580 --> 07:12.740
So it's perfect for you.

07:13.060 --> 07:13.620
Oh, okay.

07:13.940 --> 07:14.460
I'll give it a go.

07:14.460 --> 07:14.940
You ready?

07:15.420 --> 07:15.940
I'm ready.

07:15.980 --> 07:16.460
Yes.

07:16.940 --> 07:19.340
I'm going to say, okay.

07:19.340 --> 07:21.260
It's L Y C H E E.

07:21.300 --> 07:22.740
I'm going to say lychee.

07:22.820 --> 07:23.420
You bastard.

07:23.740 --> 07:24.460
You copied me.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.980
That's not what you said five minutes ago.

07:27.060 --> 07:28.300
Well, I was either that or lychee.

07:28.300 --> 07:29.860
I just wasn't, I could be lychee.

07:29.860 --> 07:32.780
Oh, I think lychee, I've, I've always said lychee to myself.

07:32.780 --> 07:33.100
Okay.

07:33.340 --> 07:33.700
Oh, okay.

07:33.740 --> 07:34.100
All right.

07:34.300 --> 07:37.380
But the whole big thing was you were going to get it wrong, but I don't think

07:37.380 --> 07:39.340
you did, so good job, Chris.

07:39.580 --> 07:41.460
Although for all you know, you have a wrong true.

07:41.500 --> 07:41.780
Yes.

07:41.780 --> 07:45.660
Well, I mean, you are speaking to the guy that read Hermione as Hermione for about

07:45.780 --> 07:47.220
the first two Harry Potter books.

07:47.220 --> 07:49.740
So, but that's, that's not what really matters.

07:49.780 --> 07:53.740
What matters is this is a self hosted photo gallery.

07:53.980 --> 07:54.620
Yes, sir.

07:54.660 --> 07:58.860
So light room and those kinds of things come with the photo gallery.

07:58.860 --> 08:03.420
Those kinds of things come with built-in galleries and stuff like that.

08:03.460 --> 08:07.460
But obviously if you stop paying Adobe, those galleries go away.

08:08.140 --> 08:08.860
That's what happened to me.

08:08.860 --> 08:12.180
I stopped paying Adobe for a bit and my galleries went away and I'm like,

08:13.380 --> 08:16.300
this is probably a solved problem in the self-hosted space.

08:16.340 --> 08:23.380
And yes, there are tons, and I do mean tons of photo galleries, but for me,

08:23.380 --> 08:31.460
none are quite as simple and just fit the bill of doing nothing except for just

08:31.460 --> 08:37.500
displaying my image in a distraction-free way with basic album support.

08:38.060 --> 08:41.540
And that's what Lychee does fantastically well, I think.

08:41.980 --> 08:47.700
So if you head over to gallery.selfhosted.show, I am in the process of hopefully by

08:47.700 --> 08:51.100
the time the episode airs, setting up a gallery for you all to go and have a look

08:51.100 --> 08:54.340
at what Lychee looks like, but in the meantime, you can go and take a look at

08:54.340 --> 08:57.020
their GitHub there at lychee.org as well.

08:57.660 --> 09:01.180
And it's a fully open source photo gallery app.

09:01.620 --> 09:04.580
And I think it's the best of the bunch.

09:04.940 --> 09:05.660
It's clean.

09:06.180 --> 09:11.860
It's really easy to navigate and the UI is clean and it has various size thumbnails

09:11.860 --> 09:14.020
for the images, which really displays them nicely.

09:14.020 --> 09:19.700
Like you have this one at the beach and it's a super wide shot of birds flying

09:19.700 --> 09:24.380
along the water, and it displays that one as a large panorama in the list.

09:24.380 --> 09:27.860
It does a really good job of doing that and making it all work.

09:28.140 --> 09:29.300
This is super slick.

09:29.580 --> 09:34.140
Now, my question for you is how are these photos stored on the backend?

09:34.140 --> 09:38.300
Is it just looking at a directory and then indexing them and presenting them?

09:38.300 --> 09:40.380
Or are you uploading them through a web form?

09:40.380 --> 09:41.220
Like, what's that like?

09:41.460 --> 09:44.060
Well, come on, you know me, if it doesn't run in a container, I

09:44.060 --> 09:45.820
don't generally run it at all.

09:46.740 --> 09:47.620
Okay, of course.

09:47.620 --> 09:50.900
So I'm running it out of a Docker container, a Linux container.

09:51.460 --> 09:54.340
Someone actually wrote in and told me off for calling them Docker containers.

09:54.340 --> 09:56.340
You know, they're not Docker containers, Alex.

09:56.340 --> 09:57.340
They're Linux containers.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.100
I know.

09:58.420 --> 09:59.220
I swear.

09:59.220 --> 10:03.660
I even said in the episode that Docker is the Kleenex of containers

10:03.660 --> 10:07.420
and someone still wrote in anyway.

10:07.860 --> 10:08.860
Thank you for writing in.

10:08.900 --> 10:15.460
I love hearing from you all, but I do know the difference between a

10:15.460 --> 10:16.980
Linux container and Docker container.

10:16.980 --> 10:17.460
Thank you.

10:18.100 --> 10:18.420
Right.

10:18.580 --> 10:19.980
Going back to Lychee.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.260
Yeah, it's running out of a container.

10:22.460 --> 10:25.500
I do a volume bind mount to the images.

10:26.260 --> 10:27.220
So I'll go and sign in.

10:27.660 --> 10:31.980
And once I'm signed in as my admin user, I am able to create albums and

10:31.980 --> 10:33.700
upload through the web interface.

10:34.100 --> 10:37.260
So you can import via link from a server.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.500
Oh, I haven't tried that one or Dropbox.

10:39.820 --> 10:40.740
Oh, interesting.

10:41.260 --> 10:41.980
That's not bad.

10:41.980 --> 10:43.340
Those are a couple of good options really.

10:43.500 --> 10:43.820
Yeah.

10:43.820 --> 10:48.460
So this action will, if you import from a server, you point it to a

10:48.460 --> 10:52.300
folder or sub folder, which will be located in the following directory.

10:52.700 --> 10:56.420
So I assume that means a volume that you've bind mounted.

10:56.820 --> 11:01.540
So this is probably a way to import entire directory structures

11:01.540 --> 11:02.740
worth of pictures at once.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.820
So I didn't know that feature existed until just now.

11:06.620 --> 11:07.220
That's great.

11:08.060 --> 11:08.940
That does seem nice.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.580
And Lychee just released.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.500
Well, I say just in 2020 time.

11:13.500 --> 11:18.220
Anyway, just released a new release in April version four, lots of changes in

11:18.220 --> 11:20.420
there, so head over to GitHub and take a look at some of them.

11:20.700 --> 11:26.220
So in our off-air conversations, I have kind of grok that you are an anti-Syncite.

11:26.580 --> 11:28.260
You don't like the SyncThing project.

11:28.260 --> 11:32.380
I know you've got a experience from BitTorrent Sync back in the day.

11:32.740 --> 11:36.460
You obviously have experience with Nextcloud and I'd like to take a minute to

11:36.460 --> 11:40.700
try to convince you and maybe a couple of people in the audience to give

11:40.700 --> 11:42.220
SyncThing another try.

11:42.220 --> 11:45.460
If it's been a little while, it might be worth a go.

11:45.500 --> 11:52.220
I too, like you had tried it, gave it a decent like 30 day try, actually a couple

11:52.220 --> 11:56.620
of times and both times walked away very frustrated and decided I wasn't going to

11:56.620 --> 11:57.020
use it.

11:57.420 --> 12:01.300
If you're not familiar with SyncThing, it is a continuous file synchronization

12:01.300 --> 12:01.700
program.

12:01.700 --> 12:05.340
It synchronizes files between two or more computers in real time.

12:05.980 --> 12:07.660
It uses encryption.

12:08.340 --> 12:10.140
There is no cloud storage.

12:10.140 --> 12:12.340
It is from machine to machine.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.940
It has a peer-to-peer discovery network.

12:13.940 --> 12:15.460
It uses an open protocol.

12:15.860 --> 12:19.300
It's open source and it's private.

12:19.300 --> 12:22.420
There's no data stored anywhere else that could be indexed or

12:22.420 --> 12:23.860
inventoried or reviewed.

12:24.140 --> 12:26.500
It uses a key system for authentication.

12:27.500 --> 12:31.340
It's overall, once you set it up, fairly just simple and just goes.

12:31.740 --> 12:36.060
It's really kind of set it and forget it kind of background stuff.

12:36.420 --> 12:37.900
So I'm looking at your server now.

12:37.900 --> 12:39.420
You shared with me fish sticks.

12:39.420 --> 12:40.980
Yes, that's what we've called your server.

12:42.020 --> 12:47.300
You shared with me this through SyncThing and you gave me a code, like an ID.

12:48.060 --> 12:52.820
If there's no middleman, how did my server reach your server to do that initial

12:52.820 --> 12:54.980
key exchange behind firewalls?

12:55.500 --> 12:57.380
Which is so cool, isn't it?

12:57.380 --> 13:01.460
So if you actually just watch the logs, when you first fire up your SyncThing

13:01.460 --> 13:06.340
server, you can see it doing a peer-to-peer discovery mechanism.

13:06.340 --> 13:11.340
There's a shared directory amongst them that they can use to discover each other.

13:11.340 --> 13:15.100
And it's incredible, actually, when you think about it, how fast that actually works.

13:15.580 --> 13:20.020
In that initial key exchange, there's a third-party server somewhere, surely.

13:20.060 --> 13:24.100
Like my server is talking to a shared directory.

13:24.780 --> 13:28.220
Does that mean every SyncThing in the world is also talking to that shared directory?

13:28.220 --> 13:30.980
So it's like a phone book for SyncThings?

13:30.980 --> 13:37.220
In a sense, there is a SyncThing discovery server that finds peers on the internet.

13:37.220 --> 13:39.260
So it's a peer-to-peer system.

13:39.740 --> 13:42.900
And so there's a couple of directory servers they can check, and then they very

13:42.900 --> 13:44.620
quickly populate and discover them.

13:44.620 --> 13:48.100
In fact, it's very impressive when you think about it, how fast it does populate.

13:48.940 --> 13:54.740
So the project just maintains a global cluster for public use that by default,

13:54.900 --> 13:56.060
SyncThing just uses.

13:56.060 --> 14:03.060
But you can point it at any discovery server you want, or you can tell it not to do that at all.

14:03.300 --> 14:06.740
It's exchanging these keys, though, so it's nice and encrypted, it's secure.

14:06.740 --> 14:11.300
And then there's a network of community-contributed relay servers as well.

14:11.300 --> 14:17.220
So if you're behind some particular tricky NAT, like I am in the RV, it will automatically

14:17.220 --> 14:22.180
help your relay server join that pool and get discovered by the other SyncThing

14:22.180 --> 14:26.140
servers and actually make the Sync session start even behind a double NAT.

14:26.500 --> 14:31.180
That's also a community-contributed thing that by default uses those community

14:31.180 --> 14:33.020
servers, but you could point at something else.

14:33.220 --> 14:38.100
So there's no hosted service that I'm connected to that's going to go away when

14:38.100 --> 14:40.620
some company buys another company or something?

14:40.940 --> 14:45.340
No, and not only that, but there's really no one company that goes down that takes

14:45.340 --> 14:45.860
this out.

14:46.180 --> 14:51.060
But for me, one of the areas I've relied on SyncThing a lot recently is the

14:51.060 --> 14:54.740
transferring files with my clients that maybe are producing media.

14:54.740 --> 15:00.780
So I have chrislash.com consulting and I have a handful of clients, some that are

15:00.780 --> 15:03.180
doing video, mostly audio, but some that are doing video.

15:03.180 --> 15:07.940
And these are really large files because they're, they're recording raw files, and

15:07.940 --> 15:11.140
then they're asking me to like cut them up or do something with them.

15:11.860 --> 15:17.180
And we looked at it and for cloud storage, like through Dropbox or OneDrive, or even

15:17.180 --> 15:20.500
using something where you'd upload it and download it, it's very exciting.

15:20.500 --> 15:24.580
It's very expensive for these 40 gig files, and there's like maybe a couple of them

15:24.940 --> 15:26.940
and they take forever to upload and download.

15:27.780 --> 15:31.540
So it was just a light above the head kind of moment, you know, where the light

15:31.540 --> 15:32.060
goes on.

15:32.060 --> 15:36.940
And I realized, holy crap, this is the perfect job for SyncThing because there's

15:36.940 --> 15:39.740
no cloud provider, so there's no cost there.

15:40.100 --> 15:44.820
Both my editing system and the system they're recording on have copious amounts

15:44.820 --> 15:47.540
of free space, terabytes of free space.

15:47.540 --> 15:49.900
So why not just have them go directly to each other?

15:50.060 --> 15:53.540
I don't need a cloud server in the middle that it's also syncing to.

15:53.700 --> 15:57.940
I don't need a big suite of software like Nextcloud offers sitting on top of my sync.

15:58.260 --> 16:02.220
I just want this computer's file system writing to this computer's file system.

16:02.700 --> 16:06.380
And the more I use SyncThing, the more it feels like it creates this pervasive

16:06.380 --> 16:08.180
universal network file system for me.

16:08.340 --> 16:15.980
I wonder how much, you know, storing my 40 terabytes on Dropbox would cost me.

16:16.140 --> 16:16.740
Yeah, a lot.

16:16.740 --> 16:17.340
Yeah, a lot.

16:18.660 --> 16:22.300
And then so I can just pick a directory and give you a link, which is effectively

16:22.300 --> 16:23.420
what we're doing with SyncThing.

16:23.660 --> 16:23.980
Right.

16:24.140 --> 16:24.540
Yeah.

16:24.620 --> 16:30.460
I mean the, the cost alone of, of, you know, S3 or a Dropbox or a Google Drive

16:30.460 --> 16:34.660
for that amount of storage is, yeah, this is quite compelling.

16:35.100 --> 16:36.060
I have to be honest.

16:36.060 --> 16:38.060
There's the peace of mind aspect of it too.

16:38.460 --> 16:42.700
Right now I'm getting ready for a road trip and there'll be a good portion where

16:42.700 --> 16:45.820
we go off grid, that's kind of like just something we do kind of on the regular

16:45.820 --> 16:49.780
now and after chatting with you, it dawned on me, you know, I'm a fan of Open

16:49.780 --> 16:52.820
Audible, I don't have all that stuff at my RV, but I have it here at the studio.

16:53.140 --> 16:57.420
I can use SyncThing to lift and move all of my audio books that I want to listen

16:57.420 --> 17:00.900
to on this road trip and it just does it in the background as the bandwidth that

17:00.900 --> 17:06.380
the RV allows and it just does it silently and, and patiently to a Raspberry Pi.

17:06.780 --> 17:10.940
And it creates this network syncing effect where I can move whatever I want,

17:10.940 --> 17:15.620
even if it could potentially flag some copyright bot, even though I own it,

17:15.620 --> 17:17.100
right, I own that stuff, I bought it.

17:17.660 --> 17:21.140
I just want to listen to it in a different device, but it

17:21.140 --> 17:22.300
would still trigger a bot.

17:22.860 --> 17:24.980
I don't have to, I don't have any of that worries with SyncThing.

17:25.260 --> 17:28.820
So is everything encrypted then between different servers when you're syncing?

17:29.100 --> 17:29.780
Yes, it is.

17:29.860 --> 17:35.380
And, um, they have a open bounty program that try to encourage people to discover

17:35.380 --> 17:40.540
issues and they have a dedicated security page at syncthing.net that gives

17:40.540 --> 17:44.540
you front and center information on how to report issues, where to get their

17:44.540 --> 17:49.900
keys, if you need to verify something or sign something and how to report bugs.

17:49.900 --> 17:50.980
Just all boom right there.

17:51.420 --> 17:53.140
They take it pretty seriously from what I can tell.

17:53.660 --> 17:57.060
And they have a foundation that they've created behind the project as well that

17:57.060 --> 18:01.460
puts out annual reports and has created bylaws and seems to really run the

18:01.460 --> 18:02.860
operations of the project for them.

18:03.020 --> 18:04.060
So I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

18:04.060 --> 18:08.260
I'm going to set a reminder for, let's say four months time.

18:08.860 --> 18:11.580
And we'll check back in at an episode in about four months.

18:11.580 --> 18:15.820
And you can ask me whether I've switched or not, I don't know.

18:15.820 --> 18:16.780
I'm skeptical.

18:16.820 --> 18:17.580
I'm tempted.

18:17.700 --> 18:18.580
I am tempted.

18:19.060 --> 18:23.700
And I tell you my, my main use case for syncing files around would be my

18:23.700 --> 18:26.060
MacBook pro where I keep all my photos and stuff like that.

18:26.300 --> 18:26.700
Yeah.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.900
My general workflow is, you know, if I go out and take some pictures, I'll

18:29.900 --> 18:33.580
import them onto the Mac book, edit them directly on that SSD.

18:34.260 --> 18:38.380
And then as I'm making those edits, you know, that creates a sidecar XMP

18:38.380 --> 18:43.820
files and stuff like that, if it would send it back then to my NAS as like

18:43.820 --> 18:48.180
a read only situation, that's my primary use case for something like this.

18:48.860 --> 18:52.660
Where I ran into some issues was when it was trying to index existing

18:52.660 --> 18:56.900
content, that's particularly, you know, I've got about two terabytes worth

18:56.900 --> 19:01.500
of very small files to index for, for pictures, for photos.

19:02.340 --> 19:07.580
And, uh, it seems to just choke down on that for a couple of days on the

19:07.580 --> 19:13.100
server side and then again on the laptop side as well, so it, because I only

19:13.100 --> 19:18.900
wanted a one way sync, uh, it seemed to struggle a bit, so I actually be really

19:18.900 --> 19:22.220
interested to know how it handles a bunch of files because that was the

19:22.220 --> 19:23.820
Achilles heel of BitTorrent sync.

19:23.940 --> 19:25.260
I don't remember if you recall.

19:25.420 --> 19:29.420
I actually bought BitTorrent sync, uh, when you had it on and filter

19:29.420 --> 19:31.620
probably half a year, half a decade ago.

19:31.900 --> 19:32.700
Yeah, me too.

19:32.780 --> 19:36.460
Um, but you throw it like in a director with a lot of files and it was just a

19:36.460 --> 19:41.380
mess and then, um, I changed to Resilio sync, right.

19:41.420 --> 19:42.380
And then Resilio sync.

19:42.380 --> 19:42.580
Yep.

19:42.940 --> 19:47.620
My tip for success is have a master server of truth, something that's online

19:47.620 --> 19:49.300
when the other ones come online.

19:49.300 --> 19:53.820
What I messed up, I think in the past is I had was mostly using sync thing on

19:53.820 --> 19:57.500
laptops and they would be on and offline at various times and what would come

19:57.500 --> 20:00.060
online and it just, I think it just caused problems.

20:00.300 --> 20:04.860
Now I run it continuously in the RV and continuously on the NAS, but I'm also

20:04.860 --> 20:08.900
considering tossing it up on a VPS to just make sure I always have a source of

20:08.900 --> 20:14.300
truth up there, not syncing the files, but running as my own discovery server and

20:14.300 --> 20:17.820
something they call an introducer server that will automatically introduce a

20:17.820 --> 20:19.380
client to all of your other nodes.

20:19.860 --> 20:20.900
Thinking about trying that.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.380
So, all right, now you got me.

20:22.580 --> 20:24.140
That's a, that's pretty cool.

20:26.660 --> 20:30.940
And if you need some cloud hosting, check out lino.com slash SSH.

20:30.940 --> 20:36.140
If you go to lino.com slash SSH, you'll get a $100 60 day credit towards a new

20:36.140 --> 20:36.580
account.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.020
This is a great opportunity to try out Linode.

20:39.260 --> 20:43.260
They have 11 data centers around the world, enterprise grade hardware, and

20:43.260 --> 20:45.580
next generation super fast network.

20:45.940 --> 20:49.820
And Linode has a really easy to use interface and lots of distributions to

20:49.820 --> 20:54.140
choose from and a ton of good pricing options starting at a $5 a month shared

20:54.140 --> 20:58.180
rig, but they also have dedicated CPU plans, GPU compute plans.

20:58.460 --> 21:00.500
They'll even integrate with orchestration management.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.420
They have Terraform as well.

21:02.460 --> 21:04.020
I'm reliably informed.

21:04.260 --> 21:05.300
That's pretty cool.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.620
And Kubernetes support is also in there.

21:07.820 --> 21:09.780
So really you have the whole gamut.

21:09.780 --> 21:12.500
They also have stack scripts, which are community scripts to spin up different

21:12.500 --> 21:16.660
parts of infrastructure that are really easy to read and easy to create your own.

21:16.860 --> 21:20.060
They have one click app deployments as well, but obviously you can just do the

21:20.060 --> 21:21.340
traditional deploy a machine.

21:22.100 --> 21:23.580
Then get running on top of that.

21:23.940 --> 21:25.340
They have block storage.

21:25.540 --> 21:28.740
So if you'd like to do something like we're doing with our next cloud setup

21:28.740 --> 21:34.140
and use block storage or object storage on the backend, it's really nice.

21:34.140 --> 21:35.420
They have both options available.

21:35.820 --> 21:39.460
As an example, I'll use object storage for show notes when there's media that

21:39.460 --> 21:43.260
we have in line in the show notes, Wes gave me this idea and it works so easy.

21:43.900 --> 21:47.340
You just upload something to the object storage, generate a URL.

21:47.620 --> 21:51.260
They have a Linode command line application, so you can just point it at

21:51.260 --> 21:55.660
a file and tell it to market as public and you just hit enter and it does the

21:55.660 --> 21:57.900
upload, it publishes it in the object storage.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.620
It generates the URL for you.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.780
And then I just dropped that right there in the show notes.

22:02.020 --> 22:03.220
It's really slick.

22:03.420 --> 22:05.860
Linode.com slash SSH.

22:05.860 --> 22:08.580
Go there, get a hundred dollars, 60 day credit for a new

22:08.580 --> 22:10.340
account and support the show.

22:10.540 --> 22:14.660
That's Linode.com slash SSH and thanks to Linode for sponsoring

22:14.900 --> 22:16.060
the self-hosted podcast.

22:16.340 --> 22:17.020
Thank you indeed.

22:18.860 --> 22:20.260
Push notifications.

22:21.140 --> 22:25.300
This is something that has been a solved problem for a long time.

22:25.300 --> 22:29.420
And somebody asked me in, in the self-hosted discord last week, how I

22:29.420 --> 22:34.500
handle push notifications and I thought, well, doesn't everyone just use pushover?

22:34.900 --> 22:36.900
I actually never have, I have heard of it.

22:36.900 --> 22:37.700
I have to be honest.

22:37.700 --> 22:43.340
I've never really thought of what a great use case would be other than possibly

22:43.660 --> 22:46.380
alerts from some systems, some software.

22:46.580 --> 22:48.940
Alerts is the primary use case.

22:48.940 --> 22:53.020
I would say for a while, actually I was using it for home assistant notifications.

22:53.020 --> 22:56.140
I also wrote a little script, which is on GitHub under the

22:56.140 --> 22:58.700
name Ironic Badger slash bootlace.

22:59.260 --> 23:05.420
A little Python script, which lets you send notifications from a Linux or any,

23:05.420 --> 23:07.340
any Python capable system, I suppose.

23:07.900 --> 23:11.060
What I use that for is to announce when my Linux boxes are booted.

23:11.460 --> 23:15.820
So my remote server at my dad's house in England, for example, every time

23:15.820 --> 23:21.460
that boots, the at reboot cron job is to call bootlace, which sends me a push

23:21.460 --> 23:24.860
over notification, and that's really useful for a remote server.

23:25.260 --> 23:28.140
You kind of piqued my attention there with the system D service.

23:28.140 --> 23:34.100
So a service that I have on every box I essentially deploy now is a system D

23:34.100 --> 23:43.020
unit that creates a self repairing SSH tunnel back to a Linode machine of mine

23:43.380 --> 23:45.340
that is always on, always persistent.

23:45.340 --> 23:51.340
So I could jump to machines from that one VPS, wherever I'm at.

23:51.380 --> 23:51.900
Does that make sense?

23:51.900 --> 23:55.900
You follow me, a jump post or a bastion type server, right.

23:55.900 --> 23:59.300
And where I could see an advantage here is if there was a way within that

23:59.300 --> 24:03.220
setup to generate an alert, when that tunnel has con has gone down or something,

24:03.220 --> 24:07.580
if there's a way to hook in at that level of the Linux system, well, guess what?

24:08.100 --> 24:09.100
I wrote a blog post.

24:11.900 --> 24:13.100
Oh, Alex, that's perfect.

24:13.100 --> 24:18.220
LinkedIn, the show notes, it uses my bootlace script, which was one of my sort

24:18.220 --> 24:22.500
of junior programming assignments at, uh, at university.

24:22.900 --> 24:27.540
So, uh, it just, you need to generate a couple of tokens from the push over

24:27.580 --> 24:32.420
interface, and then once you've got those tokens, you just add it to your cron

24:32.620 --> 24:37.100
with the at reboot to start with, and then just call the script from there.

24:37.420 --> 24:41.220
It looks like at the core of it, you can generate a push notification just

24:41.220 --> 24:44.540
by presenting the token, the user and calling a certain URL.

24:44.820 --> 24:45.820
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

24:45.980 --> 24:50.780
So push over, have an API, which when I wrote this tool, you know, several years

24:50.780 --> 24:53.860
ago, there wasn't a lot in this space.

24:54.300 --> 24:56.780
Push over's API was a lot more basic too.

24:57.420 --> 25:01.020
Whereas now, if you go to the pusher of a website and have a look at their API

25:01.020 --> 25:05.620
documentation, you can call this thing using curl from the command line, or you

25:05.620 --> 25:08.300
can use Pearl, Ruby, PHP.

25:08.300 --> 25:12.860
They've got a whole bunch of documentation, which, you know, curls installed on every

25:12.860 --> 25:14.780
system, so that might be the way to go.

25:14.780 --> 25:15.300
Chris.

25:15.460 --> 25:16.100
Pretty neat.

25:16.140 --> 25:16.500
All right.

25:16.500 --> 25:17.420
I will give it a look.

25:17.460 --> 25:21.500
I've heard of it before, and now that it's gotten your recommendation, I

25:21.500 --> 25:22.820
think it's worth a look.

25:23.060 --> 25:28.100
I posted this blog post in the discord and, uh, straight away, as is always the

25:28.100 --> 25:30.620
way somebody said, why didn't you do it this way?

25:32.060 --> 25:34.580
And I'm like, well, I didn't know about this way.

25:34.580 --> 25:38.940
And this was, uh, rock Cedars, Roxas, Roxas, I'm sorry.

25:39.060 --> 25:42.020
One of our listeners from Norway, anyway, he's very active in the discord.

25:42.060 --> 25:42.620
Lovely chap.

25:43.420 --> 25:49.340
He gave me a link to a GitHub repo called Karen see app rise, and that is

25:49.340 --> 25:51.020
in the show notes as a link.

25:51.740 --> 25:58.620
And this thing is like the universal notification library for literally

25:58.740 --> 26:00.260
anything you'd want to do.

26:00.260 --> 26:02.100
You can send messages to me.

26:02.100 --> 26:08.580
Twitter, Facebook, XBMC, Slack pushover is one of those funnily enough.

26:08.580 --> 26:09.340
Push bullets.

26:09.340 --> 26:14.220
Another one next cloud, uh, matter most if this, then that.

26:15.020 --> 26:21.100
So you could have an if this, then that event trigger when your server uses app

26:21.100 --> 26:26.740
price, which you could then put in a script when it reboots and it's fantastic.

26:27.220 --> 26:29.860
It sounds cliche, but I really like that.

26:29.860 --> 26:32.820
You can send it to Slack because then I actually will see it.

26:34.700 --> 26:36.940
I have to have that up every day anyways.

26:36.980 --> 26:40.580
So I don't know whether it's because I've heard it so many times

26:40.580 --> 26:42.700
with that little, but it does.

26:43.180 --> 26:43.660
Yeah.

26:43.780 --> 26:46.100
That little three dot noise it makes.

26:46.180 --> 26:47.220
Oh, does it trigger you?

26:47.340 --> 26:48.060
Does it get you?

26:48.140 --> 26:49.180
Gives me nightmares.

26:49.260 --> 26:49.780
Yeah.

26:51.660 --> 26:52.180
Yeah.

26:52.260 --> 26:52.820
Yeah, I know.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.460
I, I've actually muted it.

26:55.020 --> 26:57.860
So, you know, what have you and I said a lot, I don't know how many people have

26:57.860 --> 27:00.100
said it on the show, but you and I have said a lot that somebody should create

27:00.100 --> 27:02.300
a store and just take these.

27:03.180 --> 27:09.180
Tasmoto compatible devices and pre flash them and start selling them as a product.

27:09.740 --> 27:11.780
In fact, we've even said, maybe we should just do it.

27:11.780 --> 27:12.100
Dang it.

27:12.140 --> 27:13.340
Maybe we should just do it.

27:13.980 --> 27:18.300
Well, a listener out there in the self-hosted community has taken it upon

27:18.300 --> 27:19.500
himself to do just that.

27:19.540 --> 27:22.500
And he has launched cloud free dot shop.

27:23.020 --> 27:26.380
And it looks like one of the first things he's done is add a

27:26.380 --> 27:27.980
cloud-free smart plug.

27:28.660 --> 27:29.300
Check this thing out.

27:29.300 --> 27:29.580
Okay.

27:29.620 --> 27:35.460
So he's created it for $9 and he's pre flashed it was with Tasmota.

27:35.860 --> 27:39.620
And, uh, it's essentially just set as a base image ready to go.

27:39.940 --> 27:40.980
And he reached out to you, didn't he?

27:41.180 --> 27:42.260
Via the discord again.

27:42.260 --> 27:42.500
Yes.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.740
All good things apparently start on discord this week.

27:45.460 --> 27:49.660
So David reached out to me via discord and said, Hey, thanks for the great idea.

27:49.660 --> 27:52.820
I've, I've turned your great idea into my next big thing.

27:52.820 --> 27:56.420
I think he's at college, so some of, some of the funds from this for him, for

27:56.420 --> 28:01.380
example, will go to towards his college fees, tuition, I suppose you call it here.

28:01.380 --> 28:01.740
Don't you?

28:01.980 --> 28:04.860
Now here's the question, Alex, did he give you a hookup for the audience?

28:04.900 --> 28:05.820
He did indeed.

28:05.980 --> 28:09.940
You can support the show by using the coupon code self-hosted at checkout.

28:09.980 --> 28:11.300
That's all on word self-hosted.

28:11.620 --> 28:12.540
Well, that's great.

28:12.540 --> 28:13.500
That's really cool.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.860
He says he's got a lot in stock too.

28:16.620 --> 28:20.260
I, uh, I think this is nice because the no cloud forever.

28:20.260 --> 28:22.900
Pair directly with home assistant via MQTT.

28:22.900 --> 28:25.580
That is my kind of language right there.

28:25.900 --> 28:30.700
Just imagine taking one of these things out of the box and it never, ever talks

28:30.700 --> 28:33.980
to anything outside your house ever in its entire life.

28:34.460 --> 28:38.460
That's like going back 10, 15 years, you know, now we've got toasters

28:38.460 --> 28:39.820
that talk to the cloud.

28:39.820 --> 28:43.740
We've got fridges, smart plugs, light bulbs, you name it.

28:44.380 --> 28:47.380
This thing will be 100% owned by you.

28:47.380 --> 28:49.020
There's no way you're going to be able to do that.

28:49.020 --> 28:52.740
And owned by you, there's no business models at play your data.

28:53.100 --> 28:56.980
I mean, I don't know what companies are doing with my power socket, turning

28:56.980 --> 29:01.860
on and off schedule anyway, but I suppose meta metadata is, is, is powerful.

29:01.860 --> 29:05.260
So yeah, even just knowing when you're home and active is useful.

29:05.420 --> 29:06.380
Yeah, I suppose so.

29:06.460 --> 29:10.580
And then there's the angle of you, this, this device is yours until

29:10.580 --> 29:11.980
it physically stops working.

29:12.380 --> 29:17.940
Whereas as we've seen with many different IOT vendors, they can basically cut

29:17.940 --> 29:21.620
you off at any moment that their business model decides, right.

29:22.340 --> 29:24.780
And when it comes to something in the home, you know, that's,

29:24.780 --> 29:26.060
that is a big deal for me.

29:26.380 --> 29:31.860
I still have a few of those TP links that work great, but I would imagine.

29:32.580 --> 29:35.100
I would never be able to set them up again if I had to, for some

29:35.100 --> 29:39.580
reason, and TP link had pulled the, uh, the, the Casa app or whatever.

29:39.860 --> 29:41.460
Where's the incentive for TP link.

29:41.620 --> 29:44.580
If you haven't bought a new physical piece of hardware in 20 years,

29:44.900 --> 29:45.820
that'd be a record for me.

29:45.820 --> 29:49.340
I meant from them, like it's, it's the planned obsolescence

29:49.580 --> 29:51.020
model, literally in action.

29:51.260 --> 29:53.660
So while we're talking about hardware, there was that group

29:53.660 --> 29:55.140
by for the power monitoring PI.

29:55.420 --> 29:56.220
That's right.

29:56.220 --> 29:56.460
Yeah.

29:56.460 --> 29:57.220
I almost forgot.

29:57.300 --> 30:00.020
Uh, and I honestly did forget last episode.

30:00.020 --> 30:02.700
So I'm very sorry, David, two Davids, this is a different David.

30:02.700 --> 30:05.140
This is the power monitoring David I'm talking about.

30:05.980 --> 30:11.940
So he set up a website over at power-monitor.dallbrecht.tech that

30:11.940 --> 30:16.540
that link is in the show notes because I completely butchered that, but this

30:16.540 --> 30:19.260
is now essentially a web store.

30:19.300 --> 30:23.700
You can go and buy your DIY power monitor kit for $30.

30:23.980 --> 30:28.780
What the group by form that you all filled out enabled us to do was, well,

30:28.860 --> 30:31.180
I say us David's done all the work.

30:31.220 --> 30:34.180
All I did was literally give, give him a plug.

30:34.980 --> 30:38.700
What David's done is he's actually built he's he's known how many

30:38.700 --> 30:39.740
orders are going to come in.

30:39.740 --> 30:44.380
Approximately, and he's been able to order all those components in, put

30:44.380 --> 30:47.340
them in little baggies, design a custom PCB.

30:47.660 --> 30:50.860
So everything that you need is over at that link in the show notes.

30:51.140 --> 30:55.300
You can buy the, um, the CT clamps, the current transformer clamps, the

30:55.300 --> 30:59.060
things that actually do the reading of the power, um, you can buy the

30:59.060 --> 31:01.980
power adapters as well as the actual power monitor kit itself.

31:01.980 --> 31:06.740
So total cost I would imagine would be in the region of a hundred bucks.

31:06.740 --> 31:08.980
By the time you've got everything set up, you've got the power

31:08.980 --> 31:10.380
time, you've got everything that you need.

31:10.780 --> 31:14.860
The actual power monitoring kit itself is $30 as priced on the website.

31:15.540 --> 31:18.500
He gave me a code that was for all of the self-hosted people that were

31:18.500 --> 31:21.740
part of the group by to get an exclusive $10 off.

31:21.780 --> 31:23.220
Now we don't make anything from this.

31:23.220 --> 31:25.100
This isn't a sponsorship or anything like that.

31:25.100 --> 31:27.340
It's literally just a cool project.

31:27.340 --> 31:31.780
I saw on Reddit, which I got in touch with the author and here we are.

31:32.260 --> 31:35.220
The coupon code is all one word self-hosted.

31:35.460 --> 31:38.020
It's actually kind of cool that the community is working

31:38.020 --> 31:41.740
on these hardware projects and either you're reaching out to them

31:41.740 --> 31:44.980
or they're reaching out to us and we're chatting and getting details

31:44.980 --> 31:46.740
and they're creating codes for our audience.

31:46.740 --> 31:48.780
I mean, that's pretty cool, man.

31:48.900 --> 31:54.380
Well, I think we're in an interesting kind of time for open source.

31:54.980 --> 31:58.060
I was listening to a point that you and Mike made in Coder this week about

31:58.060 --> 32:04.180
how VS code is kind of the universal development operating system, if you

32:04.180 --> 32:06.420
like, that kind of struck a chord with me.

32:06.420 --> 32:08.420
Like I've stopped fussing with my tools now.

32:08.420 --> 32:10.980
I kind of, I just use VS code everywhere.

32:11.780 --> 32:14.660
And I get on with real work far more often because I'm not chopping

32:14.660 --> 32:15.780
and changing the whole time.

32:16.100 --> 32:16.260
Yeah.

32:16.260 --> 32:21.220
And I think that that shift has, has opened it up to a lot more people who

32:21.220 --> 32:25.660
are also hardware tinkerers and software tinkerers, and they're bringing these

32:25.660 --> 32:29.220
two passions together and if they're doing it from a Windows 10 machine with

32:29.220 --> 32:31.220
WSL, it's no big deal.

32:31.220 --> 32:32.740
It's just, it's totally normal now.

32:32.740 --> 32:36.180
It's not just only people on Linux that can know how to tell them that

32:36.180 --> 32:39.980
into a USB device, you know, it's opening it up to more people.

32:39.980 --> 32:41.420
And I think that's pretty awesome too.

32:41.900 --> 32:43.980
I have a question that I put out there, and if you have an answer,

32:43.980 --> 32:46.740
self-hosted.show slash contact or tweet me at Chris Lass.

32:47.220 --> 32:50.500
I have a DC powered, it's a awning system.

32:50.500 --> 32:54.420
It goes, you know, brings my RV awning out and then you push down

32:54.420 --> 32:56.220
and it brings my RV awning in.

32:56.220 --> 32:59.900
So it's like a rocker switch and it's a DC power system that powers the motor.

32:59.900 --> 33:07.060
I had to, before the show today, drive home, unlock my front door, sit there

33:07.220 --> 33:12.100
and hold the button down so that my awning would come in and then close

33:12.100 --> 33:15.980
the door, lock my RV back up and drive back down to the studio because the

33:15.980 --> 33:19.740
wind just randomly started picking up above 30 miles per hour and that's

33:19.740 --> 33:21.220
enough to really damage something like that.

33:21.220 --> 33:27.140
Cause it's basically like a huge wing alongside of my RV and it just, as I'm

33:27.140 --> 33:31.660
driving there, I'm thinking to myself, there has got to be a way to either

33:31.660 --> 33:33.700
make this accessible via home assistant.

33:33.700 --> 33:37.740
So I could just remote into home assistant and trigger it, or even like

33:37.740 --> 33:41.660
a sensor, like a wind sensor could trigger it, which is how they do it on

33:41.660 --> 33:43.620
newer RVs that have fancy awnings.

33:43.620 --> 33:44.820
They have wind sensors built in.

33:45.140 --> 33:46.700
Is it a low voltage switch?

33:46.980 --> 33:48.540
It must be.

33:48.940 --> 33:54.660
I'm not sure because what I do for my garage door is I have a, uh, what's it

33:54.660 --> 34:00.260
called a SONOFF SV, SONOFF safe voltage, I think is what it stands for.

34:00.900 --> 34:04.140
And this will do like 12 or 24 volts or something like that.

34:04.140 --> 34:05.180
Don't quote me on that.

34:05.180 --> 34:07.060
I think it's that region anyway.

34:07.100 --> 34:09.380
Um, maybe it's five, I think it's five volts.

34:09.780 --> 34:11.980
I'm sure this must be 12 volts what I'm working with.

34:12.060 --> 34:16.660
And using ESP home, I'm able to set a switch to stay open or closed for a

34:16.660 --> 34:19.740
certain amount of time in software, you know, with a delay or something like that.

34:20.100 --> 34:23.940
If I had a contact sensor, so I knew it was, yeah, that'd be tricky because

34:23.940 --> 34:26.340
you have to hold it just for a certain time to open or close it.

34:26.340 --> 34:27.060
That is tricky.

34:27.380 --> 34:28.740
Well, you know how long that is, right?

34:28.740 --> 34:32.300
So you just program in hold button for 7.2 seconds or something.

34:32.580 --> 34:32.860
Yeah.

34:33.100 --> 34:35.780
And it will just keep the relay close for that length of time.

34:36.220 --> 34:37.300
You come up here, let's wire it in.

34:37.980 --> 34:40.860
I love other suggestions to self hosted that show slash contact.

34:41.060 --> 34:43.860
Maybe there's a solution there cause I'd love to solve it.

34:43.860 --> 34:48.420
I kind of started to, um, pull back on the RV automation stuff.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.020
Like I thought maybe I'd taken it far enough.

34:50.020 --> 34:54.340
And then I came across a dude who's automated like everything, every bay

34:54.340 --> 35:00.340
door, flushing his tanks, everything's automated, everything's automated.

35:00.820 --> 35:03.060
And then I thought, okay, there's something to aspire to.

35:03.220 --> 35:04.260
I got to get ahold of that guy.

35:04.700 --> 35:07.620
Here is motivation enough for home for home automation.

35:07.820 --> 35:10.300
Anything that gets you further away from your own poop.

35:11.940 --> 35:12.540
No kidding.

35:13.180 --> 35:15.060
You don't want to even know the stories, Alex.

35:15.060 --> 35:15.620
You really don't.

35:15.860 --> 35:18.620
I'm now imagining the absolute worst case scenarios.

35:18.620 --> 35:23.020
So I'm going to try to get ahold of that guy, uh, and get some ideas from him.

35:23.540 --> 35:25.660
Uh, I know this is something that's developing more.

35:25.660 --> 35:27.500
I'm seeing more and more people talk about it.

35:27.500 --> 35:28.580
People have contacted me.

35:28.580 --> 35:29.060
It's a thing.

35:29.620 --> 35:31.660
So there's, they're selling them like crazy.

35:31.660 --> 35:34.940
The RVs right now, some of them are nerds buying them and they want

35:34.940 --> 35:36.340
to do crazy things like automation.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.820
Now there are a couple of other options for people who

35:38.820 --> 35:40.980
wanted to do power monitoring.

35:41.860 --> 35:45.540
I actually set one up about three months ago from circuit

35:45.540 --> 35:49.500
set up.us and they make, uh, an integrated board.

35:49.500 --> 35:53.460
You can buy, you know, pre-made pre-soldered board, which

35:53.460 --> 35:56.980
connects up to an ESP 32.

35:57.700 --> 36:02.940
This thing sells for about $70 and that gives you six channels of monitoring.

36:02.940 --> 36:05.100
So it's, you know, 60 ish 65.

36:05.740 --> 36:07.580
So it's about $70 for the board.

36:07.980 --> 36:12.980
CT clamps are again, about 10 bucks, same as the, um, other group buy products.

36:12.980 --> 36:17.900
That we talked about with David and, um, this thing, I'll tell you what, because

36:17.900 --> 36:20.540
it's just running on the node MCU, okay.

36:20.540 --> 36:25.180
The ESP 32 variant, it's been solid, really, really good.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.780
And I have it connected to my AC units.

36:27.860 --> 36:33.380
And so in my home assistant, you know, AC cards, I'm able to get real-time

36:33.380 --> 36:39.260
information about how many Watts each AC unit is pulling and, and then I use

36:39.260 --> 36:44.780
that against my utility, you know, the electricity cost times that by kilowatt

36:44.780 --> 36:50.340
hours, whatever, and so I can see I've spent exactly $1.83 on air conditioning

36:50.340 --> 36:55.900
today, it's actually not as bad when you do the actual math, I'm like, yeah, I'd

36:55.900 --> 36:57.380
pay two bucks to be really comfortable.

36:57.460 --> 36:57.960
Yep.

36:58.020 --> 36:58.520
Yeah.

37:00.580 --> 37:05.060
Now the power draw and whatnot, that's a whole other, uh, discussion, but you're

37:05.060 --> 37:07.700
probably going to have a lot more to talk about than that, but I'm going to

37:07.700 --> 37:10.060
you're probably going to have a lot more to talk about that in the future, I'd

37:10.060 --> 37:10.560
imagine.

37:10.820 --> 37:11.500
Yeah, I think so.

37:11.500 --> 37:16.420
I mean, that particular one was inspired by a video over on Digiblur's YouTube

37:16.420 --> 37:19.820
channel, which there's a link to in the show notes, but I had some other

37:19.820 --> 37:24.020
listeners write in when I mentioned I was going to do a sort of mini roundup

37:24.020 --> 37:28.780
of the energy monitoring options, open energy monitor.org.

37:29.260 --> 37:31.780
Now this thing is super duper cool.

37:32.340 --> 37:33.940
Does exactly what it says on the tin.

37:33.940 --> 37:38.820
It lets you monitor things that consume or create energy.

37:39.460 --> 37:43.820
So solar is supported, EV charging, you can monitor your heat pump.

37:44.220 --> 37:49.660
They have all sorts of different things, uh, sort of like recommended builds

37:49.660 --> 37:54.420
almost, so if you go over to their shop, they have a bunch of different options

37:54.420 --> 37:57.740
that you can buy, you know, there's Raspberry Pi shields, web connected

37:57.740 --> 38:02.660
base stations, man, if you're a nerd, this is right up your street.

38:02.660 --> 38:04.620
Now this one happens to be based in the UK.

38:05.020 --> 38:09.140
So if that matters to you, then, uh, there's another option for you there.

38:09.580 --> 38:12.580
They also have guides though, even if you don't want to buy anything that

38:12.580 --> 38:16.620
could be really useful, including integrating them with Node-RED or MQTT.

38:17.020 --> 38:22.980
So this is interesting because I very, very much would like to get as detailed

38:22.980 --> 38:25.700
as possible insights into what is drawing power.

38:26.180 --> 38:31.300
I was out in the woods just a couple of weeks ago and my system is using 500

38:31.300 --> 38:35.220
Watts of power and I don't have anything unusual on my fridge isn't running.

38:35.220 --> 38:38.260
I I'm not running anything strange, but all of a sudden 500 Watts

38:38.260 --> 38:39.220
of power being consumed.

38:39.220 --> 38:40.660
What the hell is using 500 Watts?

38:40.940 --> 38:43.180
You didn't buy one of those new Nvidia GPUs did you?

38:44.780 --> 38:47.020
I never did figure out what it was actually.

38:47.260 --> 38:48.660
It just eventually stopped.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.220
Whatever it was, it just stopped.

38:52.060 --> 38:55.820
Oh, oh, and then the night before you see, cause we were a little rust.

38:55.820 --> 38:59.020
We were a little rusty the night before we had left the water heater in electric

38:59.020 --> 39:02.860
mode and it draws like 900 Watts while it's heating the tank and that

39:02.860 --> 39:06.380
kept going all night long, a little dashboard, you know, a little bit

39:06.380 --> 39:08.900
of information would go a long ways here.

39:08.980 --> 39:09.900
This is so cool.

39:09.900 --> 39:12.220
So open energy monitor.org.

39:12.220 --> 39:14.820
We'll have a link in the show notes, but I'm just looking at the guides

39:14.820 --> 39:17.500
alone, even though I don't buy a single thing, this could really be helpful.

39:17.700 --> 39:18.060
Yeah.

39:18.100 --> 39:20.980
Now the fundamental thing about all three of these different options is

39:20.980 --> 39:22.780
that they all pretty much utilize.

39:23.420 --> 39:25.180
Largely speaking the same technology.

39:25.180 --> 39:30.780
They're using these CT clamps and these are little transformers that basically

39:30.780 --> 39:35.100
clip around an electric cable, monitor the electric field going through that

39:35.100 --> 39:40.500
cable and outputs a very low voltage, which you're, you can use a headphone

39:40.500 --> 39:44.740
jack or something on the other end of the CT clamp and the chip will monitor

39:44.740 --> 39:46.420
the voltage coming off of the clamp.

39:46.500 --> 39:50.500
And then you can extrapolate from those pieces of information, how

39:50.500 --> 39:53.260
many amps are being drawn and that's it.

39:53.260 --> 39:54.860
That's really cool.

39:54.860 --> 39:57.100
Boy, I've gotten some good stuff out of this episode.

39:57.140 --> 39:57.900
Thank you, Alex.

39:57.900 --> 40:00.340
And thank you out there to the community who have been getting in touch with us.

40:00.340 --> 40:04.780
Again, that's selfhosted.show slash discord or selfhosted.show slash

40:04.780 --> 40:06.460
contact if you just want to fill out a form.

40:06.940 --> 40:09.620
I want to thank a cloud guru for sponsoring this episode.

40:09.780 --> 40:12.860
You know, a cloud guru now includes cloud playgrounds.

40:13.140 --> 40:19.140
This means for Azure or AWS or the Google cloud platform, if you want to learn, if

40:19.140 --> 40:22.300
you want to get hands-on experience, if you want to create sandboxes and try

40:22.300 --> 40:26.940
things, experiment and break things, you can do that now on ACG's credit card, not

40:26.940 --> 40:33.020
yours that has bit me once before one time and one time only, I accidentally

40:33.020 --> 40:37.180
got myself like nearly a $300 bill because I was just trying to learn AWS.

40:37.220 --> 40:38.180
This was a little while ago.

40:38.660 --> 40:39.780
It was very embarrassing.

40:39.900 --> 40:42.260
It was, it was really embarrassing.

40:42.500 --> 40:44.620
A former colleague of mine has that beat though.

40:44.620 --> 40:49.580
I think his bill was like three and a half thousand dollars in a month.

40:49.740 --> 40:50.580
Oh my goodness.

40:50.740 --> 40:51.220
Yeah.

40:51.220 --> 40:52.860
Yeah, so you got to be careful with that.

40:53.220 --> 40:53.540
Yeah.

40:53.540 --> 40:56.420
So this, and it's a nice resource because it's built in with all of the other

40:56.420 --> 40:57.540
things on the training platform.

40:57.540 --> 41:01.780
It's just one click to a fast, fresh, disposable cloud environment at your

41:01.780 --> 41:04.500
fingertips, go to a cloud guru.com to check it out.

41:04.940 --> 41:07.900
And thanks to a cloud guru for sponsoring this episode of self-hosted.

41:08.300 --> 41:10.700
Also, I'm going to give a shout out for our Twitter handle at

41:10.700 --> 41:11.980
self-hosted show on Twitter.

41:11.980 --> 41:15.620
You'll get announcements about new releases or anything news related to the

41:15.620 --> 41:16.060
show.

41:16.260 --> 41:18.300
It's also a great way to ping us for questions.

41:18.300 --> 41:21.780
If you like to do the Twitter thing and you're not on the discord or don't want

41:21.780 --> 41:24.340
to do a contact form, we got all the options these days, Alex.

41:24.380 --> 41:25.460
So many options.

41:25.780 --> 41:26.500
Well, why they're over there.

41:26.500 --> 41:27.260
How do they follow you?

41:27.540 --> 41:29.220
I'm at ironic Badger on Twitter.

41:29.340 --> 41:29.780
Get that.

41:29.780 --> 41:34.180
I'm at Chris Lass and the network is at Jupiter signal links for everything we

41:34.180 --> 41:52.700
talked about today or at self-hosted.show slash 27.
