1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
Coming up on self-hosted. I'm slow cooking some servers Alex has self-hosted some AI with a nasty gotcha and a damp basement

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,980
I'm Chris and I'm Alex and this is self-hosted 22

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,680
I've got a 13 pound brisket in my fridge the only man I know who has hooked his barbecue up to home assistant

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,560
Almost almost so I bought a signals below or something now

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,200
They make a couple of products and I wanted to try and get this particular one hooked up to home assistant

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:39,520
They have another more expensive model, which does work with home assistant. And so this one I tried to decompile the APK and reverse-engineer the

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,400
Firebase database calls that it's making but no luck haven't been able to get it working

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,480
So I just have to cope with using their crappy app, which it's fine. No, it's no good

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,200
but this needs to be an obvious priority clearly we need to have you set everything else aside and

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,560
Get this working

11
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:02,560
There's no other option. It's really nice. So when you want to cook a big piece of meat in this

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,160
In the Kamado Joe you have to you know temperature is everything when you're coming to barbecue and

13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,560
Keeping a nice stable temperature to get that lovely smoky flavor. That's really important

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,280
I had lessons from Carl, you know, so, you know, it's important, you know, we'll get to this

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,080
But that's what I'm doing is I'm just slow cooking my raspberry pies in the RV

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,080
I'm not it's not a thermal getaway issue. It's a it's a slow cooking and it plan

17
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,360
I don't know what you're talking about. Ooh, could you use them to do sous-vide?

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,880
You absolutely could you just put some meat in a bag in my server in my server booth and and let it go

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,280
that is unless I have to

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,600
Deploy my current fix which I'll tell you about shortly

21
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,560
but one of the things I did for this road trip that I'm on down here in Texas enjoying myself some barbecue myself was

22
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,880
shut down my

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,000
shinobi

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,160
Home camera system, so I have no recordings right now. Everything's just

25
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,480
streaming into the wind I guess and

26
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,440
Before I fire things back up

27
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:10,200
I think you may be changing my mind on what software I go with because while shinobi did the job

28
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:17,000
I kind of had issues with it over time. I'd have to reboot and for those of you not familiar shinobi is a

29
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,640
Closed-circuit capturing application. It's a web-based app

30
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,220
It's a little strange to use but it gives you an ability to pull in all these RTSP feeds and camera feeds into a single

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,600
Application. I have a sense Alex. I have a sense you may have found something better

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,960
I was watching a video by the hookup YouTube channel and he

33
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:42,480
Really piqued my interest in blue iris now blue iris is paid software

34
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,320
It's $75 for a proper license, so I'll just get that out out the way up front

35
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,320
You know, it's not free like shinobi in terms of cost, but it is self-hosted

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,560
It is self-hosted, but it's not open source either. So, you know, there's a couple of trade-offs to make

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,960
it's running fully offline fully on my LAN, you know, it's a

38
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,840
local NVR software and

39
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,760
What really piqued my interest was he

40
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,400
set up

41
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,040
artificial intelligence

42
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,160
motion detection really now

43
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,560
This is super cool AI motion detection

44
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,920
In other words, the software is aware of what's in the picture and it's using image recognition to make that determination

45
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,140
Correct. So when I first watched the video, I thought there's no way this is all local

46
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,520
He must be leveraging some kind of a cloud API

47
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,680
sending these photos off, you know to who knows where and

48
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,720
I'm not interested

49
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:44,640
but then I watched the video and realized that he was using deep stack AI and deep stack you can run in a container on

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,920
your LAN and

51
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,600
so what this thing does is you submit a JPEG to it and then it will apply its

52
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,240
What you call it? I don't know what

53
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,920
object recognition because from what I could see in there, it seems like it can determine the difference between

54
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,680
Faces dogs all kinds of common objects that would be in a camera feed

55
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,680
There is a list of objects it can detect and you know a short list of useful ones is stuff like car truck bus

56
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,360
Person dog bear that kind of thing bear

57
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,040
Bear is on the list. That's good up in the Pacific Northwest. Trust me. It's just funny

58
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,080
And so I thought this is gonna be really hard to get working, but I'll give it a stab

59
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:33,240
I'll set aside an evening and I'll get going. So JDM who was on the last episode, you know, the server builds dotnet guy

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,360
He hooked me up with one of those HP

61
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
Z I

62
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,960
Can't remember the model name a HP box anyway, and it cost me about $100 and in this thing

63
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,960
it has a dual core seller on and

64
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,480
And most importantly it supports Intel quicksync

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
so this $90

66
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,960
x86 system with 12 gigabytes of RAM and I bought a very cheap NVMe SSD. That's like

67
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,140
60 gigs to put in there. So it was not booting off the spinning rust drive. It shipped with I

68
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,860
Have an NVR system now that can support five cameras for $90

69
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,500
Whoa, and how much storage like how long can you keep the footage with this? Did you have to add disk?

70
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,300
Are you using the network storage? How is that part working? I have a USB 4 terabyte hard drive

71
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,300
That's been sat in a drawer for about three years

72
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,180
And I thought well may as well use it for something useful

73
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,720
So I've just literally plugged in a USB hard drive into this desktop system

74
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,580
There is room inside for a three and a half inch hard drive

75
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:41,220
So I was kind of tempted to go and buy an easy store and throw it in there, but use what you got, right?

76
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,260
Yeah, especially for something like this and then you could always build on it later

77
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:52,700
well, we're talking about storage one of the things that impressed me when I was digging around and learning a little bit about blue iris and

78
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:58,860
The hookups videos. He also mentions this it would seem that if your camera supports it

79
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,380
You can do two types of video storage a low resolution

80
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,580
maybe 15 frames a second 640 by

81
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:13,180
You know 480 or whatever some really low-res video that you can store indefinitely forever

82
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,580
You have that but then when the AI

83
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,780
Detection kicks in and it notices something that is recognized

84
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:29,060
It will flip over and keep a 4k copy or whatever your camera support of that particular moment in time

85
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,580
So your stuff that has the action is in full glorious resolution

86
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:41,020
And then your keep forever stuff is lower resolution and lower frame rate. Is that how you are using it with this box?

87
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,880
Yeah, pretty much. They're called sub streams. So, you know, I have a 4k camera pointing at my driveway

88
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,780
There's no reason to record 4k 24 7 that's just honestly stupid and a waste of energy

89
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,580
but these cameras have hardware chips in them, which do the

90
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,620
Video encoding in real time. So you actually get two streams out of this camera

91
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,780
You get the 4k stream it can be either h264 or h265

92
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,860
Which is great for file size and then you get a second sub stream as well

93
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,540
which again comes out in h264 or 265 depending on what you set up and

94
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,460
The resolution as you say of the sub stream. The second stream is much much lower

95
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:28,300
So the SD stream is what we'll call the low-res stream. The SD stream is running pretty much all the time

96
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,540
It has motion detection turned on so that's what's looking for motion in the frame. So

97
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,940
What happens is motion is detected. It takes a JPEG still of that frame

98
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,220
Sends that to the AI detection software

99
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,380
The three pieces of software at work here. You've got blue iris

100
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:51,060
You've got AI motion and then you've got deep stack. So deep stack is what does the image processing AI?

101
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:59,460
motion is what reacts to the JPEGs coming in and sends the images off to deep stack and then

102
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,540
Obviously blue iris is the CCTV NVR software. So AI motion

103
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:13,520
Which is a small app which was written by someone the IP cam talk forums. I think his name is gentle pumpkin

104
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,660
This app you can figure what you want the deep stack AI to be looking for

105
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,140
so, you know cars bears trucks, etc, and

106
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:30,220
Then once it detects a certain type of object in the frame, it will then and only then tell your

107
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,820
Cameras to record the HD feed and you can set a pre record buffer of 5 10

108
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,140
30 seconds if you want to so if you were sat there thinking oh, well

109
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:43,580
Maybe it takes a bit of time for the images to process

110
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,060
Am I not going to lose in the time it takes for that to happen up?

111
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:52,420
Am I not going to lose the pizza guy coming down my driveway? No, you won't because you get the pre-record and it's all fine

112
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,980
And it all just works, you know, that's the amazing thing about it. Is it just works. So

113
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:03,900
one of the big things I missed after moving away from nest when I moved into this house early this year was

114
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,580
You know that that really super simple interface of just swiping back through the timeline to see events and stuff like that

115
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,780
And with blue iris, I have that again now and it's it's great. I've really missed it

116
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:22,360
Yeah, there's a couple of cool modes for capturing stuff including what looks like a really nice UI for reviewing those motion events

117
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,580
Pretty efficiently. Have you found that?

118
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:30,220
Okay, I downloaded an app on my iPad that has been the best way to do that kind of stuff

119
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,900
but one of the

120
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:37,300
Better bits of blue iris is that it has a web interface so I can just log into you know

121
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,300
IP address of HP server

122
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,540
Colon port whatever and bring up the web interface and I have access through wire guard to my LAN

123
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,100
Of course so I can just connect through a wire guard tunnel and do it that way wherever I am

124
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,260
That that works really nicely, but I do have a bit of a confession to make about blue iris Chris

125
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,980
It only runs on Windows

126
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:04,540
Wait a minute, but doesn't the deep stack stuff run in a container on Linux? It does. It's a Windows Linux mix

127
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,460
Yes. Yep. Well, I don't know if I want to deploy Windows just for that but at the same time

128
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:15,540
It does look significantly better than shinobi. That's would you say maybe it's biggest downside for those that don't run?

129
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,960
Oh, I mean, I don't know some people that it's not a big deal for sure. I'd say it's the biggest downside. Yeah

130
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,100
the reason I ended up going that route in the end was

131
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,260
Because of the fact that you want direct hardware

132
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,580
Support for things like quicksync to make the the video transcoding or stuff like that

133
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,720
You know not to CPU intensive

134
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,500
You're gonna have a dedicated box for it. Anyway, let's say I wanted to put it on my server in the basement

135
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,740
I would have either needed to buy a dedicated graphics card and pass that through to the Windows VM

136
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,060
So that that can do the transcoding using envy ankle or whatever

137
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,220
or I would need to buy a more modern CPU and put that in my server because I have

138
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,620
Some old Xeons that don't have quicksync or I can spend 90 bucks put Windows on this thing and just forget about it

139
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,640
Yeah, you did Windows 10. I have an old Windows 8

140
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,340
Product key that I bought back in like 2013 or something

141
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,700
And I just typed that in thinking this ain't gonna work and it did so, you know, I've got Windows 10 Pro for free

142
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,660
I was getting pretty hyped, but that is a bummer. Yeah. Sorry about that

143
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,420
Do you think deep stack would work with shinobi deep stack will work with anything that is a JPEG

144
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,660
So all you need to feed to deep stack is

145
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,020
an image

146
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,940
Doesn't really matter what the problem is. The rest is shinobi

147
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,700
It's a good it's a good app, but I just yeah

148
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,300
I when it came time to reduce thermal load in the server booth. I thought yeah, this is one that has to go

149
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,660
Well, there are a couple of others that perhaps you should try out, you know in the interest of science

150
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,100
There's motion. I and zone minder. Yeah, I have looked at them. I

151
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,440
Definitely need to give motion. I another fair shake zone minder

152
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:04,400
I'm less impressed with but maybe it's improved recently. Yeah, I mean the worst thing about running Windows is that

153
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:10,200
It's Windows and I don't really like running anywhere and I don't mean to come across as a you know

154
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,560
A typical Linux kind of, you know, four legs good two legs bad sort of guy, but I just don't

155
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
Feel the need to run it anywhere

156
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,000
That said if I'm throwing it in a closet and forgetting about it the whole time

157
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,560
Does it really matter probably not probably not no and if you were in the commercial space out in the you know

158
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,760
real world with that at businesses running

159
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,200
CCTV systems if they weren't appliances running Linux, they would be applications running on Windows boxes

160
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,040
So you do see some of it out there in the real world? Yeah, there's nothing really better in the small to medium

161
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,780
NVR space in my opinion. Yes, there's the unified thing

162
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:54,200
But again, that's a proprietary ecosystem that you need to have their cloud key dream machine, whatever. They're calling it this week

163
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,640
That's super expensive and the prices of their cameras are outrageous

164
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,240
They might be good quality, but they are super duper expensive

165
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:09,780
So, you know 70 bucks for blue iris supports up to 64 cameras and for me, obviously, I'm you know

166
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:15,400
I'm only in the house. I'm not gonna get anywhere much much above 10, you know, and that's pushing it really, you know

167
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,000
I bought one of those

168
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,440
Doorbells, we had Morgan review a couple of weeks ago, but I bought the easy vis branded version of it

169
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:28,360
Must say picture quality is fantastic on this thing and it plugged into blue iris. No problem with the RTSP feed

170
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:34,560
So another vote for that doorbell really so who needs a ring when you can get an easy vis, huh?

171
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
well an easy vis with a

172
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:43,400
24-7 Windows box talking to a 24-7 Linux box running an artificial intelligence model to

173
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,640
Decode your images apart from that. That's what we're all about here

174
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,120
Right is taking something that is a commercial offering and enrolling it yourself

175
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,480
And in this case you bought a commercial app to do it

176
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,560
But you're still able to run it locally on premises, which I think is when it comes to video camera footage

177
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,640
It's just so critical. I'm trading my time and effort for my data and convenience

178
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,680
Yes, but this in particular is visual data of activities around your home and that to me

179
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,280
Like yeah, I'll tell you like when I'm walking around in my house in the buck naked

180
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:20,000
It crosses my mind when I see a camera out of the corner of my mind. I think to myself man

181
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm really glad that's not cloud connected right now

182
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,800
Ain't no one gonna see that

183
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,600
Right exactly just go ahead and delete that footage

184
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,280
So easy vis is the maker of the doorbell you got and that does RTSP

185
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,080
So you could in theory pull that into home assistant as well

186
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,080
If you just wanted a Lovelace car just showing you the front door. Yep

187
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:47,280
I can pull it into Lovelace and I do it works great. The the camera is like a weird like fisheye lens thing

188
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,480
So that's kind of a trip getting used to that

189
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,280
But I mean that's no big deal

190
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,960
At least I can see whether those packages on my porch now without actually having to go and physically look

191
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,800
Yeah, and I it sounds silly but when you're traveling like I am right now

192
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,840
I have a camera at the studio at the door on the door and

193
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,840
I love being able to just pull it up and check on it from time to time that particular camera, too

194
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,040
I've intentionally made it possible for me to view when I'm away

195
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,680
Yeah, I just love this at the studio that way when I get a package

196
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,600
I know it's there and I can I can call up West I can say hey Wes

197
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Will you go grab that package for me?

198
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,920
Now before you left you were really quite worried about the heat down in Texas, you know melting your pies

199
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,840
How's that been? It has been tricky. In fact, I'd say it's been trickier than I

200
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:41,600
Appreciated because it really starts with the solar system. I've gotten some good experience and I've learned a few tricks

201
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,340
So I can run my air conditioning off of solar which feels like a hack

202
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,560
It feels like a cheat code for nature

203
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,920
But what I discovered when I'm running my air conditioners off of solar is when you invert

204
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,640
That much of a load it generates a lot of heat

205
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,520
so I'm already dealing with a heat issue in my server seat and now my electrical system is

206
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:11,720
Struggling to stay cool as well. So the very system that powers the entire RV which I did not expect to be an issue

207
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But when you start inverting a huge load

208
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:21,920
There's safety mechanisms that kick in when the gear reaches 110 Fahrenheit and it starts an auto shutdown procedure where certain things

209
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,880
Ironically, it wasn't the air conditioner, but certain things start shutting off

210
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:33,220
How much load does your AC unit pull in how when they're both going it's it's about 2,200 watts

211
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,840
It varies that's the same as to what my entire house uses for AC

212
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,280
Well when they're both going full bore and I really mean, you know, like it's 100 degrees out. It's hot

213
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,800
It's hot. Yeah when it's Texas heat. Yeah

214
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,360
If I run just one and it's not I don't have it on high, you know high power mode

215
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,080
I think it's around 700 watts. Okay. Well, that's still a lot but not you know

216
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,480
2000 plus it generates quite a bit of heat. So I've come up with a human solution to this problem

217
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,020
I've trained the boy on which bays of the RV to go open to create some some venting

218
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
Hey Dylan

219
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,760
Ventilation bays go open the ventilation bays and he runs out so you have to do when you're stopped obviously can't do it going

220
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,880
Down the road, so he runs out. He opens up the bays and I kick on the air conditioning

221
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,200
I had visions of some Keanu Reeves style speed stuff of hanging out the window

222
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,660
Yeah, I'm holding on to his feet. He's hanging down the side of the RV as we're going down the road. It's tricky

223
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:39,800
It's trickier than I expected because the batteries are near the drivetrain and so the drivetrain gets hot plus it's 100 degrees outside

224
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,780
So there's just a lot of thermal pressure on everything and the server seats

225
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:51,860
very warm during the day if I don't get ready for this get ready for these numbers if I don't

226
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,340
Implement a cooling solution for the server seat

227
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,700
I have seen the temperature in that booth get as high as 97 degrees Fahrenheit for the ambient air temperature

228
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,940
For all the components in there, so I've been following this very closely

229
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,660
Of course, I'm bringing all this data into home assistant and then I'm reviewing it each day to kind of see how bad it got

230
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,700
I now have like five of these

231
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,700
six in one

232
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,620
multi-sensor from

233
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:24,060
Aotec AEO tech they're kind of expensive. They're like almost 60 bucks each, but they track light UV motion

234
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:31,620
vibration temperature all that kind of stuff and it has a cool temperature sensor where it's actually like scanning using

235
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,260
infrared

236
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:38,860
So it actually it gets it's it's a really cool way to get ambient temperature and the pies themselves

237
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:45,300
Start to throttle when they reach 80 degrees Celsius and they don't really

238
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,700
Go above 85 degrees Celsius without shutting down

239
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:55,860
Amazingly, they continue to function everything continues to work even transcoding and watching video

240
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:03,660
All that stuff is still working and I have implemented another human solution here where I have tillin crack the booth

241
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,020
he just he

242
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,260
Removes the cover on the top of the booth and creates a little bit of airflow and that cools it down

243
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,860
But then we have to seal it back up to turn it into a bed every single night

244
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:18,140
So then if the temperature builds back up each day and then we crack it to cool it

245
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,740
Have you thought about a vent in the side of the thing or something? Yeah, we're looking right now at ways to vent it

246
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,920
It's tricky because it's wrapped in cloth and it would be really gaudy and it's also right as you enter the RV

247
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,580
So if I put it right in the side of the booth, it'd just be right as you walk in you'd see it

248
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:37,100
Very ugly. I am looking at other options. I've just got visions of Dylan going to sit down and you've been like, nope

249
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,080
Sorry, son. You can't sit down today. The servers have got a breathe. It's a hot seat. Yeah

250
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,580
It's so bad, so I ended up scouring the internet to find

251
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,220
The various ways to take the temperature of a Raspberry Pi

252
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,500
Because a lot of the built-in things like LM sensors that you would normally use on a Linux box

253
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,800
They don't work on a Raspberry Pi

254
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,180
I got a little script and I'll link the the details in it

255
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:09,820
but essentially if if you just cat sys class thermal thermal zone zero slash temp if you just cat that file you'll get back a

256
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,060
number and it'll be like

257
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:20,340
54,530 and what that actually is is the temperature of your CPU. So when I ran it it was

258
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:28,340
Fifty four thousand five hundred and thirty was the number that came back. Well, that is fifty four degrees Celsius fifty four point

259
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,900
Five degrees Celsius and so I know that right now as we do this

260
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:41,660
My pie is just a little under sixty degrees Celsius. So it's not in the dangerous throttling zone yet, and I just keep an eye on that

261
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,780
Basically, I'm running it on the red line

262
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:51,460
During this entire trip and I have a few ideas about relocating or using ventilate ventilation when I get back

263
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:58,260
I mean, this is production mode, you know, the real solution here is just don't go to Texas in June. No kidding

264
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,420
This was a non problem in the Pacific Northwest

265
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,500
I'm only here for a few more days and then I'm making my way north again

266
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:10,260
And it shouldn't be as much of an issue and then I think when I do eventually make it back to the Pacific Northwest

267
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,460
And get to my home base. I will probably retool this setup

268
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,220
And move it to a different spot that has ventilation because you had a spare Raspberry Pi ready to go and everything like that

269
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,380
I did. Yep

270
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,660
I was gonna be surprised if it was the pie that went first, you know

271
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:30,140
Not a power supply or you know switch or something instead, but I think I think that's a very fair point

272
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:35,240
In fact, that was the realization I had as the temperature started to rise as I realized

273
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:41,120
Oh, you know, it's gonna pop first will be the power bricks or my firewall or my Wi-Fi

274
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,780
That's what's gonna go first not the Raspberry Pi

275
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:49,020
I mean if you look at you know, any Intel system these days, you know any Intel laptop

276
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:54,740
They'll go up to 100 Celsius, you know almost instantly and so the I mean these things can cope

277
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,220
I mean a pie isn't probably built to the same tolerances as a high-end Intel chip

278
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,340
But you know these things can cope with some heat the circuit boards and stuff like that

279
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,500
They're not they're not gonna melt or anything like that, but power supplies. They really really don't like heat

280
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,860
Yeah, I'm a little nervous to be honest

281
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:16,640
I have to give a hearty plug again for these AO tech multi sensors. I've talked about them on the show before

282
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:23,220
They're not the cheapest z-wave temperature sensors. You can find out there, but I have these now

283
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:26,060
I have one in my water bay. I have one in my electrical bay

284
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,100
I have one in the bedroom one in the living room. I have one in the server booth

285
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,180
I have one up front where I drive and I all of them

286
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,060
flawlessly

287
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:43,640
Report into home assistant and what is fantastic about them is you can run them with continuous power with with USB

288
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:50,500
It's just you know, like super low voltage and then you get continuous one every second reporting if you'd like

289
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:56,340
Or you can pop a like a Duracell lithium ion battery, you know those little removable lithium ions

290
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:01,660
It has a spot for one of those you can pop in there and you can adjust the update interval by default when you run off

291
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,580
Battery, it's much slower

292
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:07,940
It's like every 15 minutes to save battery life and then the thing runs for like a year off one of those batteries

293
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,880
Nice. I really like these things you do have to have z-wave, but they're just fantastic

294
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,580
What I'm thinking is I'd love to put one under my deck or something outside that somewhere kind of vaguely sheltered

295
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,560
Just to get you know an outdoor weather station going or something

296
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,440
Are they suitable to go outside or are they indoor only?

297
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,740
I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if you could but on their box now they think about it

298
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,580
Does it does say indoor use only I don't know man

299
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:35,540
I mean once you have the power in there and you seal it up

300
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,020
It's they're pretty simple if you had it under your deck where it was out of the rain

301
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:44,460
I think you'd probably be fine because I have two of them in my outside bays and one of them is my water bay

302
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:49,620
Which is frequently exposed to the elements because I have incoming, you know hoses and stuff

303
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,840
So you might be like get away with it cuz I'm I'm doing it

304
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,620
Basically, it's pretty great and I just want to give them a hardy plug

305
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,300
So I'll put it in the show notes. No, you know, I get no affiliate or anything like that

306
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,840
But boy have they just worked really solid for me

307
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,820
What I learned is you can use motion sensors for a lot of the things

308
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:10,740
I was using cameras for for presence awareness and and automations. It's pretty great

309
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:15,340
Well, particularly in your world where you know one footstep probably shakes the entire house

310
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,980
Or at least I'm running kids, right?

311
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:26,140
Like I I see a future where when several of these sensors are reading a certain vibration level. I just automate

312
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:34,180
Something I I started playing with this for a brief period of time where if there has been motion or or not motion

313
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,540
but vibration

314
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:40,760
Disable all of the automatic lights and heater stuff because one of the tricks about home assistant going down the road

315
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,500
Which I've been dealing with on this trip. It does not automatically update its location

316
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:52,740
In fact, nothing does nobody builds these home products for a home that moves the echo product doesn't update Google stuff

317
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,980
Doesn't auto update its location. You think you have a smart tube on your on your counter and it

318
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
For the life of it still thinks I'm in Washington

319
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,460
but also home assistant doesn't update its location automatically and

320
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:09,180
Heaven forbid you've ever specified it via the YAML file because then you can't even update it in the web UI

321
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,540
So I've had to go through and like every time zone change. I have to go through and fix that stuff

322
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,820
So my automations for sunrise and sunset and all that still work, right? That really is a first-world problem, bro

323
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,140
Yeah, who you tell it I know

324
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:29,380
Doesn't mean doesn't mean I don't enjoy them, you know, it's it's these little challenges that kind of make this fun

325
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:34,180
I mean, I know you you were kind of playing around with trying to get it right in your basement recently because you got a wet

326
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:39,180
Basement. Yep, when we first moved in actually one of the first episodes where I was in this house

327
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:45,980
Around the turn of this year. We talked a little bit about how I was monitoring the temperature and humidity in my basement

328
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:52,020
now it's not a finished basement, but it's important to me because that's where my primary server, you know with the

329
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,820
15 or whatever is

330
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,700
13 spinning hard drives in is down there

331
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:03,860
So, you know if it's you know, sitting at 90 plus percent humidity for a month. I want to know about it

332
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,500
well, the rainy season has started here in Raleigh and

333
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,460
unfortunately the

334
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,740
Basement at Casa del Crech Mar is getting a little bit humid

335
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,740
Got a wet basement

336
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,420
How bad is it? Like when you say a little humid? Is it like yeah 90% plus?

337
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:26,100
Oh, so there could be even moisture like collecting in areas and maybe mold starting to develop

338
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:32,260
Yep, you can actually correlate in Grafana when I when I put some of the six month views into the discord

339
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,100
I was talking with some of the guys in there about it and

340
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,780
You could correlate storms

341
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,420
with

342
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,140
Spikes in humidity in my basement. Obviously is the ground around the house gets wet

343
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,940
It's got to come up somewhere, which I just thought was super interesting

344
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:51,220
And so I went on the Costco's website and bought a hundred and fifty dollar dumb

345
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,760
Dehumidifier as in dumb as in it doesn't have any Wi-Fi enabled nonsense or anything like that

346
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,340
And I've just thrown it down in the basement forgetting about it

347
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,460
But I didn't really want it running 24 hours a day because it's quite loud

348
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:10,780
It's directly underneath where my home offices so I could hear it through the floor. Oh, that's annoying

349
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:17,100
Yeah, and so I just thought hmm. I've got the technology to solve this haven't I I found one of my tasmota smart plugs

350
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,620
I wasn't using I

351
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:25,620
Threw the dehumidifier on there and then I put a home assistant automation to run the dehumidifier between 7 p.m

352
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,860
And 7 a.m. And that's worked great. Have you thought about getting a

353
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,380
Sensor for humidity and then just running it when humidity is at a certain level

354
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,340
that's how I know the basement was at 90 plus percent was because the

355
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:46,820
The temperature sensor I have is one of those esp8 to 66 d1 minis connected to I think it's a dht22

356
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:53,900
Which just monitor temperature and humidity that's all they do and that just reports back into the home assistant API

357
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,220
I flash that one using ESP home a little while ago

358
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:05,860
Which it just works really really reliably really really well. And so yes, you know in time. I will have the humidifier

359
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:12,020
The dehumidifier, sorry, I will have that only come on. I mean it has its own

360
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:17,820
Sensors built in once it detects the basement is you know, like 45% or whatever your target is

361
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:23,740
It will shut itself off, but I also only want it running overnight when I'm not anywhere near it. So

362
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,400
You know for me, I think

363
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:33,380
That's the best of both worlds the dumb appliance has been made vaguely smart to fit my own personal requirements

364
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,740
And then it uses its own thing inside itself to turn itself on only when needed. So hmm

365
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,540
Yeah, that is a nice combo a way to use some of its built-in sensors

366
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:48,220
I really whenever I can now and I'm buying something like a fan or a heater or a dehumidifier

367
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,220
I just look for something that just has a dumb switch on

368
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:57,380
That I can just leave in the on position and then really power cycle it with a smart switch. Mm-hmm

369
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,700
Speaking of smart outlets some of the designers at github have obviously been a bit bored recently

370
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,340
Oh, I got to admit I didn't realize they'd done a design change

371
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,620
I mostly just interact with github from the command line

372
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:15,580
So and also I don't think it's as bad on my screen because I'm on a laptop screen

373
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:22,060
It's quite a subtle change, but it was I think the same day as Apple's keynote where they announced the big sir

374
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:27,260
You know the the big design refresh with the rounded corners and the transparency and the magic

375
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,100
yeah, then comes the github theme change and it's

376
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,900
It's it's a very subtle change, but I use github every single day

377
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:41,740
So for me, it's like one of the most important websites on the internet and I hate it. I just hate it

378
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,500
there is

379
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,900
the issues and the projects and the wiki thing the little bar above the repo is now over to the left and the releases tab has

380
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,700
Moved from being a tab to being this weird

381
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:58,740
Micro sidebar on the right and oh you're right. It's a fully adaptive website now and it I

382
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:04,820
Mean, it's probably better in some ways. I'm just checking it out right now. Oh my goodness. You're right. Oh

383
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,340
Hmm I kind of like it

384
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,500
You really are an apple sheep well, no, it's just I'm on a smaller screen

385
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:17,940
So it feels like it's a little tighter, but I could see if I was on a ginormous

386
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:24,060
95 inch screen like you are it would be a lot of wasted space 95 darling. It's only 38

387
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:28,700
Well, it's bigger than my 14-inch think bad, yeah, yeah

388
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,740
So, I mean I do generally work on an ultra wide all day

389
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,660
So I'm probably not the target market the designers had in mind

390
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:39,260
When you move github to be, you know

391
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,980
A third of my screen width or anything like that

392
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:45,100
It looks like it always used to and for the most part the changes are largely

393
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,340
Fine and benign

394
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:52,420
But it's only when you start to get that wider screen where you've got elements all the way to the right and all the way

395
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:57,180
To the left and in the middle. It's like guys it was fine before you've just made it worse

396
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:03,900
You're taking a mouse road trip just to click on a UI element. Yeah, true now the good news is that

397
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,420
That pushed me. I mean, it's just something I've been using kind of not super seriously for a while

398
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:15,220
But in the last couple of weeks, I've taken it a bit more seriously and that's get tea get a yeah get tea

399
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:20,500
I think get tea. I've always called it get tea a self-hosted. I want to say github clone

400
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:26,160
That's probably not necessarily fair. Although it's very similar feature set to github

401
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:33,660
They call it a community managed lightweight code hosting solution written in go and it's published under the MIT license

402
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,620
It's really nice. It lets you mirror any public repositories that you want to so if you know

403
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:43,180
You want to mirror every single thing you push to github locally just automatically

404
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:49,600
Get tea will do that for you. It supports multiple organizations multiple users pull requests

405
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,080
Forks all that kind of stuff, you know everything you're used to really with github

406
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,660
Obviously the downside of self-hosting something like git is that you don't have the community that's there

407
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:06,380
You know, I often think that when I see big projects moving to git lab even which is obviously a next level up from self

408
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,440
hosting your own

409
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,400
Git server again, so, you know just bear that in mind when you're making that choice. I think that's fair

410
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,200
I think if you're a project that's trying to

411
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,560
Draw in as many contributors as possible. You've really got to do the math on this

412
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,240
However, if it's for yourself and some friends or for a work project

413
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,600
I don't think there's any real downsides to it if you've got the storage and the means to keep it running

414
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:37,200
I assume you probably deployed the container version of get tea. I do. Yes, and then it backs itself up to a ZFS

415
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,900
Dataset which is now remotely replicated between my server and my other server in England

416
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,900
I finally finished a six terabyte upload to England which took eight weeks

417
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,280
How often were you checking in on that thing the trouble was

418
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,640
Whenever I was uploading and my dad wanted to watch I player it kept buffering

419
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,480
So I had to keep going in and turning it off and then I'd lose a night because I'd forget to turn it back on again

420
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,880
Did he complain Alex? My my internet's just been so horrible. I don't know why yes, he did

421
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,360
Sorry, dad. Did you say? Oh dad. Sorry about that. I

422
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,320
Don't understand because so here's here's what I'm doing. I'm running from ZFS in my basement

423
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,040
I'm doing a wire guard tunnel through my open sense router

424
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,840
directly to the endpoint, which is a

425
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,600
Ubuntu

426
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,360
2004 LTS the box. I did the remote reinstall on a few episodes ago

427
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,520
So if you want to know how long this uploads been going for go back to that episode

428
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,600
And that was when I started the upload so it was a while ago

429
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,100
Wow, he was having stuttering

430
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,120
Downloading I player which is going to be a couple of megabits of most I would have thought

431
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:55,740
Made let's say 10 and he has 300 something down and I have 35 meg up here with spectrum

432
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:02,500
And it's like how can that possibly be causing buffering on his end? No kidding. You would think that your remote connection

433
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,920
That's over a transcontinental link

434
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:10,680
It wouldn't be able to mess up a download that he's doing this probably as near local as it gets

435
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,680
And the only thing I could think of and this is just a pie-in-the-sky theory

436
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,080
Is that there were too many connections open or something?

437
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:23,680
But then it's going into a pf sense box at the other end which has you know a pretty large state table

438
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,760
So it's not a cheap ISP router or anything like that, you know

439
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,000
So I'm a bit stumped to it is as to what was causing it

440
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,960
So if you have any ideas right in and let me know please. Yeah, that's tricky. It may not be a bandwidth issue

441
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:39,720
It could be could be a device issue that was causing it but six terabytes

442
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:42,600
I mean, I must feel good to have it all done now and backed up

443
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,120
Yeah, and now I just do the incremental backups, you know

444
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,880
I did my app data back up this morning and it took about 20 minutes instead of

445
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,640
Six weeks. That was nice when you're self-hosting boy

446
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:58,040
Have I learned this lesson recently that kind of peace of mind is necessary because you know when you're when you're deploying something like get

447
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,120
to yourself

448
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:04,080
You don't want to lose that data. That's gonna be really embarrassing and I am so grateful that the recent data loss I had

449
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:12,160
the vast vast vast majority of it was all recovered even though my backups had broken because I had that data stored on another system which

450
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,560
like you're doing now too and I

451
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,840
Just really really got to double down on that. Like if you're gonna do this if you're gonna host this stuff yourself

452
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,520
take the time because

453
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,840
Boy, did I learn that one the hard way recently and that's even knowing this, you know

454
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,040
Even having said this and preach this stuff over and over again, like it can still be an issue. So

455
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,040
Congratulations, sir. That must be a nice piece of mind. It must feel good. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep

456
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,600
My grand vision is I'll have the the ZFS

457
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:48,120
Replication at his house which will then itself replicate to the PI 8 gigabyte. I bought a couple of weeks ago at my sister's house

458
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:54,680
So I'll have three full copies of everything. I care about in a ZFS reachable location

459
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,800
On top of that. I have everything backed up to Google Drive that I care about and also Glacier

460
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:07,440
So between those five different points, I think I have it covered. You're set unless it's a meteor strikes the earth

461
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,880
Yeah, unless something takes out North America and Europe at the same time. I'm fine. I

462
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,040
Think you probably have other problems at that point. Maybe maybe we'll see if you're lucky

463
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,800
So thank you very much for listening. That was self-hosted 22. You can find the show at self-hosted show on Twitter

464
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,600
And don't forget the discord self hosted show slash discord. Oh, yeah, it's really kicking up over there

465
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:36,120
We've got over a thousand users these days. It's a it's a really great community. It is my social media platform now

466
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,800
I mean, I'm still on Twitter at Chris last of course, but I've been really getting a lot out of discord

467
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:49,600
So go check that out. We'd also like your emails your feedback your questions your ideas self hosted a show slash contact
