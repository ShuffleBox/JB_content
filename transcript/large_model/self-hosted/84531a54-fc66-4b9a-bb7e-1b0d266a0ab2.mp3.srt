1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
Coming up on the show, we react to home assistant password shaming both of us and then attempt to solve an age-old cloud problem.

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,480
Backups. I'm Chris. And I'm Alex and this is Self Hosted.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,200
The podcast is the middle-aged man now. We're 40.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,520
Yeah, the podcast is feeling like he's still got some pet left in him

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,560
but also has a few miles on him or her. Midlife crisis coming up. Is it a, is the podcast,

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,400
does it have a gender? It's a thing, right? The podcast prefers to be referred to as they.

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,480
Podcast pronouns. Yeah, there's a title right there. I'll tell you what. Anyway, you were gonna tell me about your off-grid solar stuff.

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,120
We've not heard about that for a while. We were chatting about this just before we hit record because I'm off-grid and

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,740
podcasting on solar right now.

10
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,000
I was just talking to you actually because you're thinking about getting solar and I think that the thing

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,440
that people have to wrap their head around is

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,080
what are you planning for? Are you planning for like a grid blackout or brownout? Are you planning for going out into the woods?

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,480
What's your scenario? And

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,040
then how much battery do you really need versus could you supplement with a generator? Like for me right now,

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,480
I think I've hit a sweet spot of

16
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,040
enough battery

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,480
capacity that I can run on it for a day or so and if it's a sunny day out,

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,040
I can get charged. I can get a 30-40% charge right now in the winter,

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,240
but I can't get a hundred percent charge off of solar right now.

20
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,640
And so I need to run the generator for about an hour once a day right now when I'm off-grid and

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,160
that's fine. I feel like that's actually a really good spot because the more battery you have, the more generator or solar you're gonna need.

22
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,880
You can't, you know, you can't charge all you have to have the ability to charge all that stuff up.

23
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,760
So I feel like I've kind of hit the sweet spot that because it's winter, you know, we're not getting prime sunshine.

24
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,800
And I'm only running the generator about once a day and otherwise we're getting, we're getting along.

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,240
I think I'm kind of in that sweet spot.

26
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,720
And I think that's something you should think about when you're speccing out your solar system for your house is

27
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,240
what are you covering for? Are you covering for a couple of days of no power?

28
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,600
Or do you really just need to cover for a couple of hours?

29
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,000
And if it goes longer, maybe you could run a generator for an hour or two.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,360
I think I want to cover just the the average daily low-level load of the house.

31
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,800
I want to make the house more sustainable. So, you know, like just all the lighting, all the computers that are on in here,

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
whatever that works out to be.

33
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,520
My electric bill is normally in a sort of hundred to hundred and twenty-ish dollar range. So it's not too crazy.

34
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,400
And for me, it's about sustainability and I was watching a David Attenborough program, Our Perfect Planet, the other night.

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,560
Beautiful 4k HDR on the LG OLED. Oh, it was magical to watch that thing.

36
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,960
Streaming from the Plex server.

37
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,280
Correct. Yeah, through the Nvidia Shield.

38
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,200
You can't help but watch these Perfect Planet things and be left with a sense of guilt about what humanity is doing to the planet

39
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,400
and how we're consuming too many resources and stuff like that.

40
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,280
So, you know, I think about how I might be in a position to do something about that as just an individual

41
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,040
when in reality we need to as a species collectively actually effect change.

42
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:17,040
But as an individual, there isn't much I can do, but reducing my use of fossil fuels even by a little bit feels like a good place to start.

43
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,400
Yeah, I love the idea of even just offsetting the computers that run all the time.

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,240
So during the day, I've reached the point where all day long I'm running off the solar power.

45
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:32,320
I'm bringing in more solar power than I am using, which is a great spot to be because that means my home server,

46
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,680
all my stuff is being sustained by the sun.

47
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,480
And I'd love to do a similar setup at the studio, a couple of panels on the roof.

48
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,520
If I could just bring in, you know, 400 watts or so, I could probably cover most of my computer gear that's running 24-7.

49
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,880
And, you know, I think about long term Alex, say even just 10 years, 15 years down the road,

50
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,320
maybe the majority of cars or all cars sold will be electric.

51
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:04,400
How does the grid in the United States, at least, handle that if we don't have some people offsetting their load with solar?

52
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,320
It seems like long term, the direction things are going between crypto mining and electric cars,

53
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,320
there's going to be more demand on the grid than ever.

54
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,200
So being able to supplement a little bit might not only just be a nice thing to do for the environment,

55
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,520
but also ensure that you have enough power to go around.

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,040
Free Bitcoin, baby.

57
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,520
Yep. Get that crypto going and maybe, maybe spend your time learning.

58
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,000
This episode is brought to you by the all new A Cloud Guru.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,400
They are the leader in learning for the cloud, Linux and other modern tech skills.

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,960
Go check them out.

61
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,680
They have hundreds of courses and thousands of hands on labs.

62
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,080
Get certified, get hired, get learning at a cloud guru dot com.

63
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,960
You could spend that time mining crypto or you could spend that time learning job skills and getting hired.

64
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:57,040
But, you know, I think maybe you and I are thinking about off grid and backup power today because a lot of our listener services are down and offline as we record this right now.

65
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,760
That's right. Yeah.

66
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:06,560
OVH, one of the largest VPS providers in Europe, have suffered a major fire this week and it's, it's taken,

67
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:16,160
literally taken out one of their data centers and had dramatic effects on some of their other regions, data centers, whatever they called for OVH as well.

68
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,520
It's just got me thinking, great, there's another disaster that I hadn't really thought about.

69
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,040
What if AWS or DigitalOcean or Linode, what if they catch fire?

70
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Oh, that's another one to plan for.

71
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Yeah, the thing that's tricky about OVH is data centers one through four, we're all kind of like in the same area.

72
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:41,280
So after midnight on the Wednesday of the week, we're recording this OVH cloud had an alarm go off.

73
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,400
The cause as of this recording right now is still unknown.

74
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,600
However, the founder and CEO speculated it may have been a UPS fire.

75
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:58,240
And he noted in a video update that he released a couple of days ago that UPS number seven had been serviced earlier that day.

76
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,120
But obviously more investigation is required.

77
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:10,240
In total, OVH had four data centers in this area and one data center, SPG two was just totally destroyed by fire.

78
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,680
And then part of SPG one was also damaged and then SPG three and four, they're fine.

79
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,800
But as we record, there's still some outages because there's some areas the staff can't get to.

80
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:32,080
There's network issue, there's still some power issues, and there's even the fact that they still have to validate that the cooling system is still fully functional.

81
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,000
It's like bad, Alex.

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is a weird one to me because every data center that I've worked near or in in some occasions,

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:54,800
they've all had argon fire suppressant systems and just fire was something that you kind of assumed would never get out of control in a data center because it's a controlled environment.

84
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,280
There isn't a huge amount of flammable stuff like on a data center floor.

85
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,960
It's just metal boxes with some cables and stuff like that, essentially.

86
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,400
So it's kind of surprising to me that it was able to get to this level.

87
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,480
I mean, if you look at some of the pictures and we've got a Reuters article linked in the show notes.

88
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,480
That building was toast.

89
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:22,320
Yeah, the CEO says something about it using the older style construction techniques and that the newer buildings that weren't damaged were using the newer style.

90
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:30,000
I wonder if that style is fire suppression, you know, or materials or something.

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,720
But it kind of got us thinking like, you know, we got kind of a sad note in from listener Kerry said my server was in data center one and I have lost it, I'm afraid.

92
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:47,520
I didn't have any complete backups because I didn't really have anywhere to back up to that server already blew my personal self-hosting budget.

93
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,480
I feel like I've lost a loved one.

94
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,760
I guess I'll get a box at home and I'll have to back up to that from now on.

95
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,640
But that's going to get very expensive.

96
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,600
That is tricky.

97
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,960
Well, it is.

98
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
It is going to get expensive.

99
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,640
But I would argue that the emotions you're feeling right now are also expensive.

100
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,680
And just in a, you know, not dollars and cents necessarily, but they're expensive in a different way emotionally.

101
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,400
And only you can quantify how much your data is worth.

102
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:24,800
I mean, I don't know what was on this particular server for you, Kerry, but I certainly know in the past when I've lost data, it hurts.

103
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:40,480
Like genuinely, you spend the next few weeks, months, sometimes longer wishing you'd done things differently, thinking, oh, if only I'd spent a couple of hundred on a Pi and an external hard drive and I wouldn't even be in this situation.

104
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:50,240
I mean, if you think about what most typical VPSs are, they are probably less than 100 gig disk, probably only a few gigabytes of RAM or something like that.

105
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,320
So we aren't talking about a huge amount of data to back up here.

106
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:02,720
And what I would say is if you've got no backup, I mean, literally zero, don't try and aim for perfect.

107
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:14,080
Just get a 128 gig USB stick off Amazon and then just get in the habit of downloading your data once a month, once a year even.

108
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,320
Because I'm sure right now you wish you'd had something, even if it was 11 months old, you'd have something.

109
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:36,800
Something I've seen really common is a lot of people these days when they have cheap cloud hosting, they're going for like a NUC with a disk hanging off it or something that they're syncing to locally and getting that peace of mind by having the data on their local network.

110
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:50,400
And I got to admit, that's kind of what I did for the Jupiter broadcasting stuff is we have next cloud up at Linode and then we have next cloud installed on the server at the Jupiter Broadcasting Studio on the LAN.

111
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,520
And we sync the stuff that I really care about.

112
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:00,480
We don't sync everything because it's hundreds of gigs, but locally we've we actually that's what it will also archive.

113
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:10,320
But so I should probably back up the studio server now that I think about it, but we back up the cloud locally to anything that's that's not ephemeral and anything's not ephemeral.

114
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,920
We try to keep locally. And then my intention is to back that server up somewhere.

115
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,440
Alex's house back plays. I don't know what, but I've got the cloud part covered.

116
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:31,040
I don't necessarily have the local part fully covered right now because I ended up and it's sort of where I connected with what Kerry was saying is I just ended up with terabytes of data, terabytes.

117
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,560
And I don't know. I don't really know how to even get that offside over the wire.

118
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,960
It's so much data. Never underestimate.

119
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:46,720
I think the saying goes the bandwidth of a truck driving down a highway full of hard drives, get it on a hard drive and mail it to me.

120
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,760
That's the best way.

121
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,640
What you're saying is I should pack up the RV and drive a hard drive down to your place.

122
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,840
That makes the most sense, right?

123
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,880
You can if you want.

124
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Three thousand dollar backup trip.

125
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,640
But, you know, so that's something we all struggle with.

126
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:09,920
But you remember when we went and saw Wendell, how he was implementing at his data center on his land, he was backing up his place was nuts.

127
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Yeah, he was backing up his client's cloud data for them to his to his service, just in case their cloud providers had issues.

128
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,360
It's something you do kind of have to think about is when I'm building something, what is the risk to losing this?

129
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:29,760
Like, there's some things I have on the cloud that if they were if they were if they were lost, it'd be inconvenient, but we could regenerate from source material.

130
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,640
Not everything.

131
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:38,240
Yeah, it is. It is about evaluating the I don't want to say like opportunity cost or whatever, but everything has a cost.

132
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,720
And, you know, photos, for example, are irreplaceable.

133
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,080
You can't recreate those moments, videos, whatever.

134
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:53,840
But, you know, a PDF with an invoice of some work you did 10 years ago, maybe that.

135
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,160
OK, it might be nice to have it, but that's all just nice.

136
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:12,320
But, you know, the cost of a one time backup off site to a pendrive or something like that is so small compared to the amount, just the amount of time you're going to spend noodling after you've lost some data.

137
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,880
Whilst you reconstruct what was actually on that file system and remember, oh, yeah, that was on that box as well.

138
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,680
I lost that, too. And some of that stuff won't occur to you until years later.

139
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,440
That's very true. And it feels so you just feel like you've like somebody cut a hole out of you sometimes.

140
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:40,080
And I think that especially when it comes to the pictures, I have opted to leave on for the iPhone members of my family, our iCloud photo backup for everybody.

141
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,720
I even end up paying for like some sort of family storage plan.

142
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:52,560
So that way I knew because my mom is on there and, you know, my wife and I just wanted to know that everybody's photos were backed up, even though I also back them up.

143
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,240
My my phone, every picture I take goes off to next cloud in 100 percent quality.

144
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,480
But Google Photos also duplicates everything.

145
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:10,960
I'm off the Google Photos sauce because I'm using the iCloud photo, but it's like, you know, trading one one service for the other.

146
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:18,240
I mean, there are arguments to be made for Google's privacy policies versus Apple's, but I'm not sure I fully trust either, to be honest with you.

147
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,960
Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm kind of gambling that Apple's are a little better and that they're not mining it for data.

148
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,560
But make no mistake, bro, Apple are mining you for your cash.

149
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,960
Right. No kidding. No kidding. And we have talked about Google Photos alternatives.

150
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,320
And it's not that I'm not going to implement one of those.

151
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:42,160
That's actually been my intention. But I still feel like I get some value out of just paying Apple to back that thing up because they are so valuable.

152
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,280
And that's really photos are it like pretty much everything else.

153
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:50,600
I'm comfortable how I back it up, although I know there's a couple of areas that I could probably do better.

154
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,680
I mean, do you feel like there's an area where if you were to audit your backups right now, you'd look at and go, oh, no, Alex, you got to fix it.

155
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,360
Yeah, I do. So the last couple of months have been a bit crazy for me.

156
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:08,080
My wife and I had our first daughter and she spent she came a little bit early and she spent a couple of months in the hospital.

157
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,640
So things have kind of been decaying whilst I've been there.

158
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:17,080
Congratulations. An official on show. Congratulations. Yay. Yay.

159
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:25,160
I've known this the first time you said anything on the show. So, yeah, I didn't want to go public until she was home just in case because anyway, she's home.

160
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,960
She's healthy. Everything's good with the world.

161
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:36,400
So, yeah, I purchased the Helios as to be my on site replication backup device.

162
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:43,720
And then when everything went down in January and Ella was born, I was in the middle of rebuilding my server at that point,

163
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,560
because that's when the whole GVTG thing started playing up and not working quite as I'd hoped.

164
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:56,120
So, you know, I was at the hospital most of the day, but I'd come back here for two or three hours just to unwind and just mess around with hardware and stuff.

165
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,120
And I never quite got to putting my backups back in place.

166
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,240
And it's one of those things you think, oh, I'll get to it. I'll get to it.

167
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,560
And then before you know it, a year later, you have a problem, you think, crap, I never got to it.

168
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,080
Yeah, I do have plans which we'll share with you soon as to what's going to replace the Helios in that situation.

169
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,840
But I'm tight lipped for now.

170
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:25,600
But we do have a we do have an upcoming segment on backups that will hopefully give you some ideas and inspiration.

171
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,680
Linode dot com slash SSH.

172
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,320
Go there to get one hundred dollars in Linode credit.

173
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,760
This could be the opportunity to try out Linode.

174
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,480
Linode dot com slash SSH.

175
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,440
You also support the show.

176
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,600
Linode is how we host in the cloud.

177
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,080
We've built all kinds of back end services for the show and for Jupiter broadcasting on Linode.

178
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,480
And I have a peace of mind knowing that Linode has great support.

179
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,480
So if I ever get stuck, well, I know they're going to take care of me.

180
00:15:52,480 --> 00:16:02,200
In fact, they just received Linode, just received the People's Choice Stevie Award for favorite customer service in the computer services category.

181
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,320
That's huge.

182
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:09,520
You guys having great support has been one of the key things that people write into our show when they switch and tell us about Linode.

183
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,720
They have eleven data centers worldwide.

184
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:20,920
In 2016, they became their own ISP and have full control over their own network and have built out super fast connections to their worldwide data centers.

185
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,080
They have a brilliant cloud manager that makes it simple to use Linode.

186
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,480
If you're a brand new user or if you're a pro, you're going to love what they have.

187
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,800
Then there's the pricing Linode has dialed this in.

188
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,560
The value is nuts.

189
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,760
They have systems, of course, are like five dollars a month.

190
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,880
Right. But you can do different combinations depending on what you need.

191
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,080
Maybe you need a lot of memory or a lot of CPU.

192
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,600
Maybe you need GPU. Maybe you need several GPUs.

193
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,160
Maybe you need it all.

194
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,920
I got to be honest, we recently just decided to go all in on our matrix server because it's getting busier and busier.

195
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,840
And it's awesome what Linode lets you do.

196
00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:00,240
And even when you need to upgrade an existing machine or clone a machine or snapshot, it's all just brilliant in their cloud manager.

197
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,240
I'm really impressed with the complexity that they can make seem so simple.

198
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,920
You know, like I'm I'm managing servers in data centers around the world and they just make it all seem so intuitive.

199
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,960
So I like that. And you can really get a sense of that when you try out our one hundred dollar credit.

200
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:20,880
One hundred dollars when you go to Linode dot com slash SSH, see what I've been talking about.

201
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,680
And of course, you support the show when you go there and you visit that URL and you use that and you sign up.

202
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,360
It tells Linode that our audience is supporting the show and that Linode should keep supporting us.

203
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,320
It helps us put these shows out for free.

204
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,080
It makes content like this possible.

205
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,120
It's the circle of podcasting.

206
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,560
Go to Linode dot com slash SSH.

207
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,480
Don't be using that stinking Linux unplugged Linode code.

208
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,320
Got to be using that self-hosted Linode code.

209
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,960
That's right. Live long.

210
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:53,360
Hashtag SSH, live long and and go to Linode dot com slash SSH.

211
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,720
My home assistant box password shamed me this week.

212
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,600
Did you get this? Yes.

213
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,360
Did you get it for the SSH add-in?

214
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,360
That's what I think I got it for.

215
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,560
Mine was node red, I think.

216
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,040
Oh, node red.

217
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,080
Alex, you're using a bad password with node red.

218
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,120
Well, maybe even home assistant itself.

219
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,360
Yeah, I don't know. I've been a bit busy.

220
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,560
I didn't actually read it.

221
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,240
I just saw the notification and dismissed it.

222
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,840
I was like, oh, whatever. I'll get to you later.

223
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,440
I dismissed it and then mine came back.

224
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,520
Mine is for the add-on core underscore SSH,

225
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,160
which uses secrets which have been detected as not secure.

226
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,960
Probably a lot of people in the audience are getting

227
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,120
this if they're on home assistant.

228
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,200
It's a new feature, quote unquote,

229
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,200
that has been integrated and frankly, probably a good one.

230
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,800
Yeah, but the Internet being the Internet, people are pissed.

231
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,800
I don't really get, oh, maybe I'm just becoming

232
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,800
a grumpy old man now I'm a dad and outrage culture is just,

233
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,080
I don't know, I'm just tired of it.

234
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,120
So there's a link in the show notes to a post by Troy Hunt,

235
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,120
who is an incredibly well-respected security researcher.

236
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,560
And he's the guy that is behind the website,

237
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,480
have I been pwned?

238
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,400
And this website is incredible.

239
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,680
You can tap in any password into their database

240
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,000
and it'll tell you that yes, this password

241
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,720
is out in the wild.

242
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,120
And as Troy puts it, if your password is in this list,

243
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,840
I've seen it clear text, which means that the bad guys

244
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,720
have seen it clear text.

245
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,480
So no matter your opinion on how secure you think it is,

246
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,440
I guarantee it's out there in the wild somewhere

247
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,800
and somebody knows what it is.

248
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,840
So don't use that password.

249
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,560
It's actually pretty clever for the home assistant

250
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,760
developers to build this in.

251
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,360
So the way it works is your passwords are hashed,

252
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,880
the first five characters of that hash,

253
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,880
so just the first five characters of a hash

254
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,280
of your password are then used to query

255
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,200
the have I been pwned website.

256
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,160
It then returns a result of possible password hashes

257
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,120
that match and then home assistant checks that list

258
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,320
against your hash locally.

259
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,800
All of that validation is happening on your box.

260
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,960
And what I find really interesting,

261
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,240
and Troy goes into full details in the article,

262
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,960
he basically goes through the home assistant forums thread

263
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,320
where people are bitching and moaning and whining

264
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,680
about this feature being turned on without their permission

265
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,960
to give you an idea of how, I don't wanna say stupid,

266
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,680
but honestly, when I was reading this Troy Hunt article,

267
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,760
I was like, yeah, this thread is stupid.

268
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,960
Someone was complaining it was sending out data

269
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,640
over their metered connection.

270
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,360
He then proceeded to say, it's a few bytes.

271
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,520
Like 36 kilobytes, yeah.

272
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,720
Yeah, we're talking five times smaller

273
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,480
than the average webpage load.

274
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,280
If you notice that on a metered connection,

275
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,600
then you've got problems.

276
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,800
Right, we're not really talking very much data.

277
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,400
And it's probably, although we don't know for sure,

278
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,960
only happening when you start up home assistant

279
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,480
or reload the config.

280
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,480
How do you feel about doing this on your local LAN?

281
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,480
I mean, I'm definitely guilty of reusing passwords

282
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,600
on the internet.

283
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,360
I'm certainly guilty of doing it on my LAN.

284
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,600
That seems to be the crux of everyone's argument

285
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,600
is my LAN, my rules, I have a safe, trusted environment,

286
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,480
and I don't wanna have to use good password hygiene.

287
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,320
I don't want long passwords that are unique.

288
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,040
And I can definitely relate.

289
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,600
They're sort of, when you do this for a living,

290
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,120
every now and then it's nice to be a little lazy.

291
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,480
Like, what's the saying about the guy who makes shoes,

292
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,280
his kids always have the worst shoes.

293
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,800
You know, like, cause you just get home,

294
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,840
it's the last thing you wanna do, right?

295
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,440
It's just the last thing.

296
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,120
So I do understand that.

297
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,720
However, this is where I fall down on it.

298
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,160
The home assistant community is kind of a special case

299
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,960
because they're playing around with IoT smart devices

300
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,080
that are network connected.

301
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,920
There's a higher threat level,

302
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,440
a broader threat attack surface, if you will.

303
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,360
And so I feel like you have to be a little more secure

304
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,560
when you are willing to ride the IoT train, you know?

305
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,920
Because the problem is any one of those individual devices

306
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,480
one day could become compromised,

307
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,240
and then that becomes a launching off point

308
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,000
where they can go after other devices on your LAN.

309
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,720
And we see it happen.

310
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,000
And to that point, Troy actually makes this point

311
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,280
in his article that LinkedIn,

312
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,080
I mean, we're talking a proper website here,

313
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,760
had a data breach because one of their developers,

314
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,800
Home Networks, had a weak SSH password,

315
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,000
which allowed people to pivot through

316
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,520
that developer's Home Network into LinkedIn servers

317
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,360
and compromise LinkedIn that way.

318
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,960
Yeah, they brute-forced his iMac.

319
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,440
And so, you know, I put myself in that developer's shoes

320
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,480
and I think, well, holy crap,

321
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,640
someone could pivot into Red Hat from here

322
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,040
and I wouldn't want that.

323
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,000
So I think to myself, okay, actually, Troy,

324
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
you've probably got a point here.

325
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I do need to step up my game.

326
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,840
And he uses 1Password.

327
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,080
I think he's on the advisory board for 1Password.

328
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,160
But we talked last episode about Bitwarden.

329
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,360
And I really cannot emphasize enough,

330
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,080
you know, there are command line clients

331
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,400
and stuff like that that you can use

332
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,480
so you can put it in scripts

333
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,040
and do all sorts of fun stuff if you want to.

334
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,840
And I think that's gonna have to become

335
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,400
a 2021 rather late New Year's resolution for me

336
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,000
is to try and use that CLI stuff more on my LAN at least.

337
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,880
Yeah, good passwords, I think, matter

338
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,320
when we're kind of riding the cutting edge of technology.

339
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,920
Even if you're not intentionally exposing your LAN

340
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,040
to the internet, you never know

341
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,560
when some crazy thing could happen.

342
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,920
It's unlikely, but it could happen.

343
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,760
But really, you also never know

344
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,760
if one day somebody is gonna rock up

345
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,200
onto your Wi-Fi or something,

346
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,080
or somebody joins your LAN that you put on intentionally,

347
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,280
but they have some misconfiguration or infection.

348
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,200
So it's kind of like multiple layers

349
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,840
of protecting yourself is the best kind of protection.

350
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,480
And I think when you look at logins,

351
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,640
you could look at maybe not only unique passwords,

352
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,840
but when possible, also using keys to do SSH sign-ins.

353
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,440
So that way you have to have maybe a key and a password.

354
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,120
And that just takes it a little bit step further.

355
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,760
Like that LinkedIn developer,

356
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,920
if he had had a decent password or password and a key,

357
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,480
then the attackers would have never gotten onto his iMac

358
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,000
and then never gotten into LinkedIn.

359
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,560
And when the whole COVID lockdown thing started

360
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,560
and we had a lot more people all of a sudden

361
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,520
working from home, that was one of my first concerns is,

362
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,320
well, now all of these corporations are as insecure

363
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
as people's home networks are.

364
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,600
And you never know when that could be an issue as well.

365
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,320
I just think as much of a pain in the arse as it is,

366
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,040
there's enough tools and we know enough information now

367
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,440
that it's worth doing.

368
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,360
The only thing I would have changed

369
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,880
with how Home Assistant has implemented this

370
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,360
is give me an option to turn it off for a bit.

371
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,720
I'm not fixing it while I'm out here in the woods.

372
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,640
Simon sat checkbox for seven days or something.

373
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,680
Or until next update even, that could work too.

374
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,160
I do believe they're actually working on

375
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,280
making it opt in or opt out now.

376
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,240
So for what it's worth,

377
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,280
the outrage has had some effect on the feature.

378
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,520
But I mean, I think it's great.

379
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,960
I think anything that we can do,

380
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,400
and here's another point about the Home Assistant community

381
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,520
being a special case as well,

382
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,520
is a lot of people are coming to servers for the first time

383
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,440
because of Home Assistant.

384
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,720
They're running a box in their house for the first time

385
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,720
that's got SSH listening on something,

386
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,800
maybe for the first time ever.

387
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,320
And anything that Home Assistant can do

388
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,200
for those kind of newer users

389
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,200
that aren't enterprise grade buffoons like me

390
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,120
that just reminds them that, hold on,

391
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,480
if you're exposing your house to the internet

392
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,160
through Nebuchadnezzar, through WireGuard,

393
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,320
through whatever it might be, there is some risk.

394
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,960
And then when you couple that up

395
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,240
with some leaky washing machine

396
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,200
that's running an old firmware from eight years ago,

397
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,680
there are risks to these things.

398
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,960
And I for one applaud the Home Assistant project

399
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,240
for having the stones to put this in.

400
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,280
Yeah, and it definitely, I think,

401
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,720
will improve the community security overall,

402
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,640
which is a good thing for them.

403
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,200
And as they make this a commercial product one day,

404
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,040
because you know this has got to be

405
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
the direction this thing's going

406
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,880
when they try to make it a consumer product

407
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,360
and not just a more advanced prosumer

408
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,680
or enthusiast product.

409
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,800
Nerd product.

410
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,640
Go on, you should say it.

411
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,520
Nerd product.

412
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,640
It's a nerd product right now.

413
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,240
But one day, maybe one day,

414
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,000
they're gonna try to sell it to average Joes

415
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,400
who have bought all these smart devices

416
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,280
and now they just need something

417
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,680
to make it all work together.

418
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,840
And buy the $100 Home Assistant appliance.

419
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,920
And you need these kind of things built in.

420
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,400
And they just recently had a run-in with add-ons

421
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,880
that were leaking information.

422
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,720
So I could see why this is an area they're investing into.

423
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,600
And I say good on them.

424
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,080
And I think it'll be a smooth transition.

425
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,160
There is also something worth looking into

426
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,480
is they're working with K-Aninemy,

427
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,160
which is a Cloudflare hosted service.

428
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,880
So Cloudflare's kind of proxying

429
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,160
some of these requests to anonymize them.

430
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,280
That's also made some people uncomfortable in all of this.

431
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,640
But I did a read through of the setup

432
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,320
and it actually, it seems like they've done

433
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,160
a really, really solid job here.

434
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,280
So we'll have a link in the show notes

435
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,520
at selfhosted.show slash 40

436
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,120
for the Cloudflare information on that.

437
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,020
If that has also perhaps gotten the hairs

438
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,720
on the back of your neck up a little bit,

439
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,800
it's worth reading about, we'll have information.

440
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,120
I'm super curious to hear what you all do

441
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,680
for your local LAN password situations.

442
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,520
Do you use a password manager?

443
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,760
Are you like me and reuse the same password on every box?

444
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,100
Let us know, selfhosted.show slash contact.

445
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,440

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,800
across your entire environment

452
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,580
and troubleshoot issues faster with Datadog.

453
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,520
You see Datadog's continuous profiler

454
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,260
automatically collects information

455
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,840
from your production servers all the time.

456
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,380
So then when you're ready, when you need to,

457
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,880
you can quickly look and analyze all of the data

458
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,640
with minimal overhead and get finally

459
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,000
a unified picture of your entire environment.

460
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,760
Correlate code performance with server metrics

461
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,400
and other monitoring data in real time, beautiful dashboards.

Datadog.com slash self-hosted,

463
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,880
just to look at these dashboards.

464
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,920
And then they have a lot of tightly integrated additions,

465
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,880
add-ons, tracing, log management,

466
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,280
and that continuous profiler

467
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,480
that brings it all into one platform, that's Datadog.

468
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,000
And imagine getting yourself a visual dashboard

469
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,120
that you can use to communicate issues with your team.

470
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,620
Developers to sysadmins, sysadmins to executives.

471
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,180

478
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,720
and create one dashboard, you'll get some free swag,

479
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,400
a Datadog t-shirt.

480
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,840
And I miss swag, I miss event swag, I miss t-shirts.

481
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,240
So go get one, datadog.com slash self-hosted,

482
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,920
create an account, get that trial going and get a t-shirt,

483
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,040
and then begin visualizing your entire infrastructure.

484
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,340
Datadog.com slash self-hosted.

485
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,720
Listener Chris writes in,

486
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,000
I run a number of services from my home server

487
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,880
that are internet facing.

488
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,040
I understand that the smart best practice

489
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,800
is to minimize that as much as possible,

490
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,380
but some of these things I wanna access

491
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,500
whilst I'm away from the house.

492
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,440
Some of them are also used by family members,

493
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,320
and so it's unavoidable on some levels.

494
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,960
My question is this, how do I know if a service

495
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,320
is hardened enough to raw dog it out on the open internet?

496
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,160
Wow.

497
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,440
We're just gonna, let's let that sit for a second.

498
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,200
How do you know, how do you know if you can raw dog it?

499
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,840
Yeah, I mean, I feel this one, you know, Plex is one,

500
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,260
you know, Plex you kind of feel safe about,

501
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,960
but how do you know about some of the lesser used ones,

502
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,600
like Subsonic or something, right?

503
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,480
I think it's safe to assume that everything is porous.

504
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,200
Everything.

505
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,000
Yeah, I hate though that the answer

506
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,760
always is put it behind a VPN.

507
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,600
Why?

508
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,180
I mean, with WireGuard these days,

509
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,520
it's really the, the barrier to entry,

510
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,500
as long as you don't screw up your subnets like I did,

511
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,840
the barrier is pretty low.

512
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,300
But you have friends and family

513
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,740
that are using your Plex server

514
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,220
without connecting to WireGuard.

515
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,280
You know, like Plex is such a great example,

516
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,560
or JellyFan, because you do often wanna share with others.

517
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,400
That's true.

518
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,800
And I could see that being true with others as well.

519
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,520
Nextcloud he mentions in here,

520
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,720
but BabyBuddy, I'm not so sure about that.

521
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,600
You know, that starts to get a little more niche.

522
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,460
And I hate to be the guy that just says,

523
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,340
well, if it's big, you can use it publicly,

524
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,800
and if it's small, you should hide it.

525
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,920
But that's kind of a general rule of thumb that I follow.

526
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,160
You know, you try to figure how many eyes have been on it.

527
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,360
You know, another angle to consider

528
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,780
is security by obscurity.

529
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,800
Now, if you think that, you know,

530
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,880
you just have a random URL that you're using

531
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,540
to access this service,

532
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,880
and you've put it behind a reverse proxy,

533
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,920
and probably these days you're using Let's Encrypt

534
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,660
to generate a certificate for it,

535
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,160
so that you know that things are secure.

536
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,580
Well, I've got bad news for you, I'm afraid.

537
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:22,580
If you go to crt.sh and type in your domain name,

538
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,120
you'll see every single certificate

539
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,900
that's ever been issued by Let's Encrypt

540
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,400
for your domain name.

541
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,440
And so you think to yourself,

542
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,240
okay, well now my super secret string

543
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,680
that I came up with to hide this service

544
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,400
is now out in the public domain.

545
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,140
So really, it's not secret at all.

546
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,860
One thing you could do to kind of work around that

547
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,240
is use a wildcard certificate.

548
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,620
That would kind of sort of help,

549
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,520
because it wouldn't, you know, publish the actual string.

550
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,020
But it just goes to show to me that, you know,

551
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:00,440
security through obscurity is really not, it's an illusion.

552
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,860
Yeah, and I was gonna suggest throwing it out

553
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,940
on like a VPS, like Linode,

554
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,720
and run your software there for a bit

555
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,100
on the public internet and monitor the logs.

556
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,180
But you could run something for six months

557
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,260
and nobody nibbles at it,

558
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,380
and then on, you know, day one of seven months,

559
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,820
somebody nibbles on it.

560
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,900
It's tricky that way.

561
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,940
And so it really, the only way to have full peace of mind,

562
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,960
and that's what I've opted to do here in LadyJupes,

563
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,300
is just to have absolutely zero outside inbound.

564
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,300
That's the only way I've found

565
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,140
to be completely comfortable with it.

566
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,160
I don't necessarily always follow that rule myself,

567
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,480
because some services like mail servers,

568
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,240
web servers, media streaming servers,

569
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,940
they have to be public by their very nature.

570
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,340
So you have to hope that those just have more eyes

571
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,220
and that they get a little more attention

572
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,860
and that they've been a little more audited.

573
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,380
But remember, logging is your friend.

574
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,300
So if you ever suspect something's weird is happening,

575
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,220
go check your logs, see if you have weird logins,

576
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,740
see if you have somebody hitting your website all the time.

577
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,740
Use DataDog.

578
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,540
Yeah, yeah, use something that will,

579
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,700
you go through there and alert you.

580
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,780
That absolutely could be a good way to go.

581
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,140
It's a good question, though, listener Chris,

582
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,860
because I'm sure it's one that people struggle with.

583
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,960
So let us know what you out there would do,

584
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,280
selfhosted.show slash contact.

585
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,460
Now, we have Joseph who writes in.

586
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,680
He says, I have a bunch of those Tekken smart switches

587
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,040
flashed with Tasmoto, and they work great.

588
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,380
I have a need for smart switches

589
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,480
to replace my wall switches, though.

590
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,740
You know, for example, like my kids' closet lights,

591
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,100
which are always left on.

592
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,100
I would also love to replace the controllers

593
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,380
on our ceiling fans with smart devices,

594
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,660
something that would toggle the light on and off,

595
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,260
and also set the fan to high, medium, or low,

596
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,820
or even off completely.

597
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,280
My preference would be for something I can self-host,

598
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,260
non-cloud connected, open source software.

599
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,700
Are there any devices which would actually fill this need

600
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,380
or similar to the way the Tekken smart plugs do?

601
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,460
What are your thoughts?

602
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,980
Well, this is an easy question.

603
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,740
The Shelly devices are exactly what you're looking for,

604
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,020
and I think we've talked about them on a previous episode,

605
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,100
but just to recap,

606
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,220
they're about the size of an Oreo cookie,

607
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,560
and they go inside the light box behind the switch.

608
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,860
So you don't change the switch itself,

609
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:14,860
but this little cookie-sized box has a relay inside it.

610
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,500
You need to do a little bit of wiring.

611
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,180
So, you know, mains voltage, be careful,

612
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,680
or get an electrician if you're not comfortable.

613
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,760
They make a few products.

614
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,380
So they make a 2.5, which will let you do

615
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:28,500
up to two switches in the same box.

616
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,540
They make a single unit as well,

617
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,660
and they make a bunch of other stuff

618
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,220
that does like rolling shutters for garage doors

619
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,580
and all sorts of stuff.

620
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,940
So go to Shelly.cloud and check out their stuff

621
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,780
if you're interested,

622
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,820
but it's exactly what you're looking for,

623
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,460
and you can put TAS motor on them.

624
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,340
So Mahendra writes in,

625
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,620
in the latest episode,

626
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,820
you suggest file run for a simple file browser.

627
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:53,540
I wanted to suggest another minimalist alternative.

628
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,380
It's very light with no database required

629
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:00,700
at github.com slash file browser slash file browser.

630
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,380
God, that rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?

631
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,180
It's very simple, easy to remember.

632
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,860
Yeah, it is just a web-based file browser

633
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,940
that sits on top of a directory.

634
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,060
Each user gets their own directory,

635
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,280
and it's just a standalone app.

636
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,460
Pretty simple.

637
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,300
I like it.

638
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,660
Even easier than the one we had talked about before.

639
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,600
So I'm gonna think I'm gonna grab this and try it out.

640
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,440
It is nice.

641
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,780
Yeah, I tried it out before the show,

642
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,420
and I kinda wish I hadn't bothered with file run now.

643
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,080
This is, I think, my new standard kind of

644
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,660
throw it up and forget about it remote access software.

645
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,800
So yeah, great job.

646
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,620
Thanks for writing in, Mahendra.

647
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,340
Now I've mentioned Chowdown a couple of times

648
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,860
on the show before as a self-hosted recipe app.

649
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,700
I still use it.

650
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,520
I still love it.

651
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,980
It stores all of my recipes in clear text files on disk,

652
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,420
but there are some alternatives,

653
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,180
and we've had a couple of listeners write in,

654
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,340
and one of them is called Tandoor Recipes.

655
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,420
What do you think of this one, Chris?

656
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,100
It looks really good.

657
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,820
This, if anything, would probably get me

658
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,780
to start doing something like this,

659
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,600
because it has a planning aspect,

660
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,580
which is useful for a guy like me.

661
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,620
I can do a little meal planning,

662
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,880
but also has a sharing feature,

663
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,460
and it's all on a progressive web app,

664
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,580
which means my wife and I could share it on our phones,

665
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,580
which I think would be really nice.

666
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,140
And then the other thing I would need is,

667
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,620
and it does support importing from Chowdown, is import,

668
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,280
and it has Chowdown import

669
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,020
as well as Nextcloud, Cookbook import,

670
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,900
Mealy, Paprika, Saffron,

671
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,540
and a couple of others it can import from.

672
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,940
I think it's easy to try out.

673
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,140
Now we have mentioned this one previously,

674
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:37,300
because it goes by the name vabeen1111 slash recipes

675
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,140
on GitHub.

676
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,880
That's the repo it's in.

677
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,220
I think the Tandoor name must be new.

678
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,480
I don't know how old exactly it is.

679
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,760
Yeah, it is a new release too,

680
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,660
so that might be maybe they did a name change.

681
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,140
But they are using MKDocs for their documentation,

682
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,220
so I've got to give them a plus point for that.

683
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,660
Yeah, it says here that they're happy to announce

684
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,780
they've released a new version

685
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,900
which gives the application its well-deserved name

686
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,620
and logo, Tandoor recipes.

687
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,660
So there you go.

688
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,900
It runs out of a Docker container.

689
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,780
It will also run on Unraid, Synology, Kubernetes.

690
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,700
You can do it manually as well if you want to.

691
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,260
There's a bunch of interesting stuff

692
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,740
about syncing and storage in their documentation.

693
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,860
So it's going to take a lot for me to throw away Chowdown,

694
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,940
because I do genuinely really like it,

695
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,740
and I've modified the CSS so I've got some fuzzy search.

696
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,260
You know how I love my fuzzy search.

697
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,300
Oh, that's cool.

698
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,540
You know, I've customized Chowdown for my own needs,

699
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,940
but then maybe the grass is greener.

700
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,460
Maybe I should try this one out.

701
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,840
I mean, it does have the import functionality.

702
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,260
Downside though is it needs a Postgres database,

703
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,860
and I've already got like,

704
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,940
it feels like a dozen different database containers running.

705
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,560
Do I need another one?

706
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,560
That is a constant internal battle,

707
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,820
and sometimes I'm just down to, ah, who cares?

708
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,700
Just run a whole bunch.

709
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,700
You've got the resources.

710
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,620
And other times, like the sysadmin in me

711
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,780
is just not having it.

712
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,300
You can't run three copies of Postgres.

713
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,260
That doesn't make any sense.

714
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,100
They're different versions.

715
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,660
They have different security issues, different features.

716
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:02,900
What are you doing?

717
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,380
And it's a recipes app at the end of the day.

718
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,220
Do you know what I mean?

719
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:10,220
Just having the files in clear text on disk

720
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,980
feels more future-proof to me.

721
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,780
So if this person loses interest

722
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:18,220
in maintaining this particular app for whatever reason,

723
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,820
I'm not up the creek without a paddle, so to speak.

724
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,860
That I think is a great feature of Chowdown.

725
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:26,460
That kind of clear text backend gives me peace of mind.

726
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,860
That's just a peace of mind for that kind of stuff.

727
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,260
And if Chowdown stops working for some reason,

728
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,460
I can just pull it up in any text editor

729
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,560
and it's still readable.

730
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,460
Yeah, it's almost as good as writing them down

731
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,480
on an index card.

732
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,160
You know, you laugh at that,

733
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
but I'm pretty sure if I asked my mom

734
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,420
to go and find me a recipe for something,

735
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,580
she would find it in less time than it takes me to fix.

736
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:50,060
Oh, Chowdown's not working?

737
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,780
Okay, well, let me just SSH in and do this, do that,

738
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,740
do the other.

739
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,140
And before you know it, 10 minutes later,

740
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,620
you've forgotten that you're actually looking for a recipe

741
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,580
and then you go and order pizza instead, so.

742
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:04,180
Yeah, and meanwhile, she's got the index card ready to go.

743
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,020
It's very true.

744
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,980
There's something to that.

745
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,500
A reminder, you can find our sponsor,

746
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,140

747
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,860
They're just slash the Cloud Guru.

748
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,020
It's really easy, like on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube,

749
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,900
pretty much all the social media platforms,

750
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,740
just slash a Cloud Guru.

751
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,060

My wife's CAM3 came in this week,

758
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,380
so we're gonna have a little chat about that today.

759
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,740
Yes, that's gonna be the post show.

760
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,660
I ordered a few of them, so I got thoughts.

761
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,020
Of course you did.

762
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,700

So thanks very much for listening, everybody.

769
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:16,260
That was selfhosted.show slash 40.
