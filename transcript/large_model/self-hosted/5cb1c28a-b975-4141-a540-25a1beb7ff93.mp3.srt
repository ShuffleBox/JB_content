1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Is there some sort of universal law that states that your infrastructure is going to fail

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,800
whenever you're not around?

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,580
Because I seem to always be subject to it.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:15,440
There I was, down at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, actually the night before, dreaming

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,580
about what we might discover, thinking about what we might learn.

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:26,060
I decide to check in on my Intrepid RV, about seven hours north of where I was.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,960
I pull up the Home Assistant app, and it just isn't quite loading, and I think, hmm, that's

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,960
strange.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,040
So I fire up Tailscale, and I pull up the web interface, because the web interface always

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,160
works when the app doesn't work.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,920
And it still doesn't load, and I think, huh, I wonder if something's wrong with Home Assistant.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,020
And a few days go by, and I finally make it back to the RV, and I discover that my Raspberry

13
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,240
Pi home server, that runs more than just Home Assistant, I mean it runs my Plex instance,

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:03,680
my SyncThing instance, my Duplicati instance, my Smokeping instance, my Markdown notes instance,

15
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,640
and Home Assistant, dead.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Just dead.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,640
Dead as a doornail.

18
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,120
Just totally dead.

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,120
Uh-oh.

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,240
And you know the worst part?

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,240
I don't even know why it's dead.

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,080
What do you mean you don't know why it's dead?

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,520
I don't even know what happened.

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,400
I mean, we've been on the road, and I've been trying to figure it out, but I just haven't

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,400
had a chance.

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,720
I haven't even hooked up an HDMI screen to it.

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,720
Oh, I see.

28
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,240
I did the hardware swap thing, you know?

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,400
Yeah, so what was your plan with that hardware swap?

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,360
Because it seemed like a brilliant plan at the time.

31
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,360
Well, thank you.

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,520
I mean, I bought a duplicate Raspberry Pi, same thing, Raspberry Pi 4, 8 gigs, in the

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,920
same case, forever ago.

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,440
Just ready to go.

35
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,320
I swapped everything over, hit the power button, and nothing.

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,360
And I looked at my dead Raspberry Pi, and I realized, oh, there's an SD card in here.

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,840
I think it might...

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,320
This is like the first one I ever set up.

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,080
I think maybe it was using that SD card for, like, slash boot.

40
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,200
I can't remember anymore.

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,560
But when I first did this, it was kind of a workaround to get Ubuntu running on the

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
Raspberry Pi 4.

43
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,840
It was before official support had landed.

44
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,620
And I think maybe the SD card was used for grub or something like that.

45
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,960
But I don't know why it would have died while it was running.

46
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,360
So I'm wondering if something more significant happened, but I just don't know at this point.

47
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,360
Maybe there was an unintended upgrade.

48
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,960
Maybe a live patch.

49
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,960
You know, I did the whole reboot thing, and of course, I'm trying to SSH into it.

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,600
I can't ping it.

51
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,440
I can't ping it on the tail scale IP either.

52
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,520
It seems gone.

53
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,600
And the worst part of that is it runs a lot of automations in the RV, like all of the

54
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,160
lighting, the heating, of course, the cooling, a lot of the outdoor stuff.

55
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,160
It's all managed by Home Assistant on this stupid Raspberry Pi.

56
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,920
And so it's like we're running things like animals with switches.

57
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,040
Yeah, this place went from a five star to about a three and a half, I think.

58
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Wow.

59
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,640
You let this guy into your home, Alex, you know?

60
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
Indeed.

61
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,240
Well, this seems like an appropriate moment to introduce Brent again.

62
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
Hello, Brent.

63
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
How are you?

64
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
Welcome back.

65
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,240
Thank you very much.

66
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
And what about you, gentlemen?

67
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,920
Well, actually, we had some feedback at the meetup in Pasadena that we don't introduce

68
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
ourselves anymore.

69
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,240
So let's just take a moment for anybody that hasn't worked out that I'm Alex and the other

70
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
guy is Chris.

71
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,240
Hey, Chris.

72
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,040
Hello, everybody.

73
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,040
Thank you for being here.

74
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
Okay, good.

75
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
Now that's out of the way.

76
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Welcome to episode 81.

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
Yeah.

78
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Now that's out of the way.

79
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,400
I want to ask you if this has got you thinking about deploying some real hardware in the

80
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
production system?

81
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Ooh.

82
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Throwing shade.

83
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Fair enough.

84
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:52,320
You know, Listener Jeff was really the MVP of our West Coast road trip and he sent me

85
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:59,080
home with an atom based unit that only draws five watts and it's got two cores, but four

86
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,080
gigs of RAM.

87
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm tempted to just build a dedicated home assistant system out of that.

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Why not?

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,640
Well, I just got shipment notification about my home assistant Yellow.

90
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,720
I should be receiving it this week.

91
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
I did.

92
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
No, you didn't.

93
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,000
I've got UPS, I've got a UPS tracking number and everything.

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,040
Where's it coming from Guam?

95
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,600
I think they landed in Texas and then some some distribution place in Texas is sending

96
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,600
them out from there.

97
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
Right.

98
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
Okay.

99
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,520
It's so exciting because this marks the second crowd supply thing that I've ever backed that

100
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,480
I'm actually going to receive.

101
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,560
Very excited.

102
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,560
And so the home assistant Yellow is supposed to arrive this Friday.

103
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,000
The only thing was I kind of wanted to go something more powerful.

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah.

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,480
Well, I'll tell you what's got me thinking is you often run into these issues when you're

106
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,360
on the road remotely and that kind of thing.

107
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,360
Yeah.

108
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Almost exclusively.

109
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Oh, it's so annoying.

110
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,400
I think you need to embrace IPMI of some description.

111
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,600
I think that needs to be a requirement for you.

112
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Oh, interesting.

113
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,920
Oh, you know, I thought about that for the studio and I agree, but I had not thought

114
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,120
about it for the RV.

115
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,520
Well, of course, there's the Pi KVM project for x86 boards that don't come with a BMC

116
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
chip built in.

117
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,420
But, you know, you could probably build a server that does everything.

118
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,120
How many pies do you have deployed in in dupes right now?

119
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,600
Well, come on.

120
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
I pared it down.

121
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,720
I pared it down to only two.

122
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm not I'm not saying this to be a to be a, you know, a phallic object.

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,940
I'm just saying this out of love, like genuine question.

124
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,940
It was four.

125
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,840
It was four in production, and over time I pared it down to two.

126
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:45,320
OK, so if we allow a 10 watt budget per pie, give or take right now, it was 40 watts.

127
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,160
It's now 20 watts.

128
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,560
You could build a very capable x86 system that does everything all of those pies do

129
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,480
and has a BMC built into it, you know, given the power is it's not you're not quite as

130
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,360
limited on power as the Mars Rover is, but you're not far off.

131
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
It's true.

132
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,120
Every watt does count, especially watts that run continuously.

133
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,180
What about heat consideration?

134
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,480
That is a thing.

135
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
That's a big thing.

136
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,080
I've been really trying to do the math on that, too.

137
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,440
When I build the next one, I'm trying to think, do I want to build it in a booth or do I want

138
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,440
to go somewhere else and just drill holes?

139
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,480
The Raspberry Pi and maybe that's what finally killed it was heat.

140
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
I don't know.

141
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,360
But the Raspberry Pi has done a remarkable job of holding up to intense temperatures

142
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,520
over long periods of time.

143
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,340
My bet really is what happened is there was some kind of a power brownout that was enough

144
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,440
to make the Pi reboot and the SD card was toast in that time since it last rebooted.

145
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,720
I don't obviously have any data to back that up, but that's what I suspect probably happened.

146
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:51,600
So in total, I spent $169 on the Home Assistant Yellow and I was watching their live stream

147
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,960
today as we record and I don't think they're going to make many more of these because they

148
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,320
can't get their hands on the compute module.

149
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,400
So they finally got this thing shipping.

150
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,320
In fact, they don't even have the POE one sorted out yet.

151
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:13,400
They have the non POE one shipping and they may not make many more just because you can't

152
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
get them.

153
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
That's a real shame.

154
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,520
I mean, but on the flip side, it's not a good look for the project, is it?

155
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,040
Charge people money for something and then not ship it for a year or two.

156
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,560
I know it's not their fault, but yeah, I ordered it mid September and now we're here in early

157
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
October.

158
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,520
It was just over a year ago that I ordered it.

159
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
That's a long time.

160
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,120
It's a very long time.

161
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,440
I mean, if you look at what Valve did with the Steam Deck, I know that Valve orders of

162
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:47,160
magnitude got more buying power than Home Assistant, Nebuchadnezzar as a company, but

163
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,100
I paid Valve five bucks to sit in a queue, essentially.

164
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:56,440
And then when the time came to actually ship my hardware, that's when my credit card got

165
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,940
charged.

166
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,880
Maybe something like that could work for Home Assistant.

167
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:04,720
Yeah, I think, too, the tricky thing here is they based it on the Pi compute module

168
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,580
and that became one of the hardest things to get your hands on in bulk right now.

169
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,920
The Raspberry Pi stuff is like still impossible to find.

170
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,600
I was just doing a check recently and the most common thing you can find at the moment

171
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,160
is the Pi 3.

172
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,040
Which from what I'm learning, isn't that useful for anything.

173
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,880
Did you see that Jeff Gehling did a video just last few days where he talked with the

174
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:33,320
founder of the Raspberry Pi project about availability and things like that and how

175
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,440
there's no end in sight.

176
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:41,760
They're making 400,000 of these things a month and something like 95% is going into industrial

177
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
use cases.

178
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
Wow.

179
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
95%?

180
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,000
Is it even really meant for industrial use cases?

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,680
I noticed, because Jeff also does an accompanying blog post, and I noticed that one of the comments

182
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,480
on Jeff's blog post was sort of giving a different version of this story.

183
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,480
They claim, I don't know how they would know, but they claim having inside knowledge and

184
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,040
that Broadcom is actually a bit pissed at the Raspberry Pi folks because they're going

185
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,760
commercial and essentially like the whole deal for getting a super cheap chip from Broadcom

186
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,640
was that you were creating this educational device for kids and now you've announced your

187
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,240
intentions to IPO and make a commercial company out of all this and now you need to pay the

188
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,920
commercial rates and you're going to be lumped in with our commercial clients and not our

189
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,360
educational clients.

190
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,160
And so they're also getting slower supply from Broadcom, according to this commenter.

191
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,880
But I have to say, it kind of seems like it checks out.

192
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,640
I think the Raspberry Pi Foundation, much like all of us, are kind of being caught off

193
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,320
guard by just how ubiquitous it's become.

194
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,320
And I think it's a perfect example of how if you influence the right people, the nerds,

195
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,240
the engineers, the people tinkering, if you influence them, they will then go into work

196
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,880
and say, hey, well, why don't we just use a Pi?

197
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,200
If I, you know, I remember my last job we had on the wall, we had TV screens showing

198
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,840
build statuses of all the different CI processes and each one of them had a Raspberry Pi running

199
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,040
because one of the development team in that sprint team was like, well, we need to monitor

200
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
the status.

201
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,960
Why don't we just get a Pi because it's only 35 pounds, stick it behind the TV and jobs

202
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,060
are good.

203
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,160
And I think not only has the Pi Foundation been caught out by the success of their product,

204
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,280
but so it sounds like has Broadcom.

205
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,680
Perhaps that would make a lot of sense.

206
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:38,440
It's tricky because I actually think if they don't figure something out, the M1 platform

207
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,440
is going to make a pretty worthy successor for home labors.

208
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,240
If imagine for a moment, if you would, Alex, there was decent Linux support for the M1,

209
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,840
which we may be only nine months, 10 months away from.

210
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,640
And that includes Thunderbolt support because right now I'm hanging USB disks off a Raspberry

211
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,680
Pi.

212
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,960
But if I had Thunderbolt support, I could have real actual PCI attached storage.

213
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:09,920
And if I had an M1 CPU, I would have something that has built in HD 64 decoding and encoding

214
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,120
like a Banshee.

215
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,700
And if somehow Plex could come along and get support for that, then we'd really be cooking

216
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,700
with gas.

217
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,800
Don't you just wish that Mac OS server wasn't terrible?

218
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,360
Is Mac OS server even a thing anymore?

219
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
I think they might.

220
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
No.

221
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,360
I don't even know.

222
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
I know.

223
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
It's really sad.

224
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,560
And honestly, I feel like Docker desktop isn't good enough on the Mac for production use

225
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,560
the way I would want.

226
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,560
I want something headless.

227
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
I want it to be Linux.

228
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,880
I mean, Asahi this the last couple of weeks released preliminary support for GPU acceleration

229
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,800
under Linux with the M1 chip, which is a huge, huge milestone.

230
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Yeah.

231
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
Using a Rust driver.

232
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
A Rust driver.

233
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,280
I mean, that's amazing.

234
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,280
So maybe, I mean, maybe it's not too far off, but it's not going to be within the time that

235
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,440
I need to build my next home server.

236
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,600
I think I'm going to have to just out of practicality base it around this yellow, it would seem

237
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,560
crazy not to, you know, showing up on my doorstep as I'm returning back in town and I need a

238
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
new server.

239
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,600
If you need an appliance, it sounds like that might be it.

240
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,240
But let me ask you this.

241
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,320
If money was no object, what would you do in tubes?

242
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,760
The trickiest thing is storage.

243
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,480
If money was no object, I'd spend a lot on storage and it'd be solid state storage because

244
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,560
I have to go down the road.

245
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,360
So that's where I'd probably blow a lot of money.

246
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,560
You're not going to believe this, but I mean, for 90% of the time I have found the Raspberry

247
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,760
Pi 4 has been fast enough.

248
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,140
The pages could have always loaded faster in Home Assistant and I'm on a couple of versions

249
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,280
behind now.

250
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,240
Home Assistant could have always been faster.

251
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,160
But Plex and Sync thing and like my Markdown docs, I forget the name of the Markdown docs

252
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,440
website thing.

253
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,360
Those all always ran totally fine.

254
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
I was surprised.

255
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,180
I was shocked that I got by with a Raspberry Pi.

256
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,100
It was just Home Assistant that could be a little bit faster.

257
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,760
But you know, a lot of that might've come down to storage technology.

258
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,200
That's why I think the M1 would be perfect, you know, 10, 20 Watts, a lot of horsepower,

259
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,800
fast storage.

260
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Just don't want macOS.

261
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,160
Well, if, if power was no object, I know we, we made money, no object just then, but I

262
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,360
think power is probably your biggest limiting factor as well as maybe space.

263
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,920
You can't have a big 42U rack in there, can you?

264
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,200
Like if power was no object, would you do the same thing?

265
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,560
If power was no object, I think I'd be tempted to build a rack unit into one of the storage

266
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:32,960
bays, you know, and go with like a big x86 box and probably do a lot of hosting in dupes

267
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,520
just because that's, I like the idea of it's, it's truly decentralized.

268
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,280
I can move it, I can take it with me and I'd rather have the source of truth here as long

269
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,720
as I had a good backup.

270
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,740
Right now I hold the source of truth and everything at the studio.

271
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,320
So I'd probably build a rack unit if I could go crazy, but I don't need it.

272
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,760
You know, I didn't lose any data.

273
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,280
My server is down, but I didn't lose any data.

274
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,000
So the setup is working as I need it to.

275
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:05,440
Well, the obvious thing that comes to mind for me is the Intel NUC, that kind of tiny

276
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
mini micro thing.

277
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,720
I don't know if you've been following serve the home at all over the last few months.

278
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,320
They've been doing a series called tiny mini micro where they get these four, five, six,

279
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:25,080
10 liter micro, essentially thin client machines designed for business applications.

280
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,480
And they've got powerful chips in them and 32 gigs of Ram and you know, all the rest

281
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
of it.

282
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,120
And they are the size of two or three CD cases stacked on top of each other.

283
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
What about something like that?

284
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,440
That is pretty tempting, especially if it's got, you know, reasonable horsepower and it

285
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,680
can do decent video decoding.

286
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,000
That would be and networking and connectivity because I always need to add more storage.

287
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,560
I think what you'd be looking for there as your silver bullet for video decoding would

288
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,320
be quick sync support, which does limit you to Intel.

289
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,760
But you know, speaking from experience, quick sync uses anywhere from four to six, maybe

290
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,040
eight watts to transcode a 4k stream.

291
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,720
And it's hard limited at eight watts.

292
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,200
Like I've never been able to get it to go above eight, eight to 10 watts is about the

293
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,520
maximum I've ever seen.

294
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:20,360
So even if you're doing multiple trans codes at once, which in an RV I find very unlikely,

295
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,800
quick sync is the way to go.

296
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,160
That is the nice thing is I only really need to build for like two televisions.

297
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,840
Three is the max.

298
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,720
Well I guess there's always tablets, but very unlikely that we'd have three TVs and a tablet

299
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
going in the RV.

300
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,520
But you could negate the transcoding requirement entirely just simply by using something like

301
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,840
Tedar or Handbrake to pre encode the media.

302
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,800
And you can automate all that stuff, you know, into the correct formats for the TV.

303
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,720
You know, actually I think for the most part, I mean, for the most part, most of my stuff

304
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,080
doesn't need transcoding because it's either an Apple TV or an NVIDIA Shield and it's H264

305
00:15:54,080 --> 00:16:01,840
and AC MP3 or AC3 audio for the most part, not 100%, but I'd say, I'd say 85, 90%.

306
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,400
How many terabytes do you need here in JOOPS?

307
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
I'd love four.

308
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,120
I'm getting by with two, right?

309
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,360
I would love to do more even.

310
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,400
I mean, ideally I'd love 14, let's be honest.

311
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,040
But I get what I do is I, I batch over just the stuff we're watching, like a couple of

312
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,080
series for the kids, a couple of movies that are for Hadiya and I, a couple of movies that

313
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,640
are for the kids and a couple of movies that are for family and just a few TV shows.

314
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,560
And I just kind of keep like what the current season is that we're watching of a show on

315
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,560
there.

316
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,060
And I don't need to keep everything because I have a larger storage at the studio.

317
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:39,040
I have no idea how reliable it is, but I just looked on Amazon just to sort of see how much

318
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,200
a two terabyte SSD costs these days.

319
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:49,280
The brands you've heard of, Samsung, Crucial, et cetera, they're all in the 160 to 200 range

320
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,160
per two terabytes, but there's a brand here I've never heard of called Levin and these

321
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:02,600
guys make a two terabyte 3D NAND SATA 3 internal SSD for $99.

322
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,040
I mean, you throw a few of those in a raid, what could go wrong?

323
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,080
You throw a few of those in merger FS and what I'm thinking is before a trip, right,

324
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:16,440
you take one or two of these into the studio, sync across what you need to through a USB

325
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,780
interface that's much faster than a network interface and then you throw it back into

326
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,440
your hot swap bay in dupes and you're good to go.

327
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,440
Yeah.

328
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,840
And then you just keep it topped off with a little sync thing action, you know?

329
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,840
Yes.

330
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,360
Yeah, that could totally work.

331
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,120
What I'm kind of picturing is like a board, right?

332
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,400
Like a removable, almost like a piece of plywood that has the yellow mounted to it and the

333
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:47,080
disks mounted to it and the Zigbee and Z-Wave antennas mounted to it and I can just insert

334
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,480
this board into dupes and I can pull this board out of dupes.

335
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,040
And if I need to work on it, I just remove the whole componentry, all of it, put together

336
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,880
as one piece, I take it to the studio and I work on it and then I bring it back into

337
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,400
dupes and I just reinstall it and reconnect things.

338
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,320
I love that modular approach.

339
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:09,720
I'd love to add into that mix your new mixer plans too, that would be kind of fun, huh?

340
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,080
Oh, imagine the ultimate setup, right?

341
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,040
Like server capacity, media capacity and production capacity and just slide them all in.

342
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,580
You have, you know, like eight XLR inputs on the front of this thing for all your mics

343
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,020
and what have you.

344
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,040
And then on the back, you've got a couple of network jacks and a power cord going in

345
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
and that's it.

346
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
That would be pretty cool.

347
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
That sounds really sweet, actually.

348
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,560
That'd be pretty, pretty, pretty great, pretty, pretty great.

349
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,760
Let's work on that then.

350
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,800
But speaking of upgrades and stuff like that, I assume you saw that Paulus from the Home

351
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:47,280
Assistant Project has been very, very excited that Matter finally hit 1.0 this week.

352
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,560
Damn it.

353
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
Can you believe this?

354
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,580
You know what that means is that they're beginning to pull it into Home Assistant.

355
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:59,200
They're beginning to build in Matter support into Home Assistant and an actual device shipped

356
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,700
in the last week, a light bulb with Matter.

357
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,840
It's actually happening, but you know, it's really still like probably six months to a

358
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,800
year out before just general devices are available.

359
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,240
And of course, of course, I'm doing this rebuild right now.

360
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,440
Of course, my server died.

361
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,820
I couldn't hold out.

362
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,520
You know, I was holding out for Matter.

363
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,160
You know, that was what I did.

364
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,600
That was my entire intention all along was to hold out and just replace my devices with

365
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,880
Matter devices.

366
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,720
And just as it becomes official, just as the first device ships, my system dies and I'm

367
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,920
going to have to either go all in on Z-Wave or ZigBee.

368
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,280
ZigBee is very well tested, though.

369
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:42,840
I wouldn't imagine Matter is going to be stable, properly stable for another, I don't want

370
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,840
to say five years.

371
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,760
That might be a bit pessimistic, but you know, at least two or three before we've got, you

372
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,040
know, the ubiquitous level of devices we have now in ZigBee land.

373
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,240
I pulled the trigger and I pre-ordered the Home Assistant.

374
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,240
I think they call it...

375
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,240
iLink?

376
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
What do they call it, Alex?

377
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,960
SkyConnect, I think.

378
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,600
Yeah, SkyConnect.

379
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,800
It is a ZigBee radio.

380
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,040
It has ZigBee and Thread, and they promise they'll do a firmware upgrade and add Matter

381
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,040
to it.

382
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:17,600
So Home Assistant SkyConnect is their own hardware ZigBee radio, which seems like, okay,

383
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,680
so Home Assistant's clearly going all in on ZigBee.

384
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,840
This is a clear signal from the project.

385
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,280
ZigBee is the future of Home Assistant and Matter, but then they made the announcement

386
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,160
that they just full-time hired the Z-Wave integration guy.

387
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,800
And now the Z-Wave integration guy is a Nebuchadnezzar employee.

388
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,320
Mixed messages, it sounds like.

389
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,840
I'm so confused as to what direction to go right now.

390
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,040
I think what they're saying is, whatever you want to use, we're going to support and we're

391
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,180
going to try to support it really well, but they haven't like just clearly articulated

392
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,180
that to me.

393
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,360
So I'm trying to figure out like, well, if I'm going to buy one device, should I buy

394
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,760
ZigBee or should I be buying Z-Wave or what?

395
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,980
It's like, I'm probably going to have to replace some of these devices because some of these

396
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,800
things are probably not going to unpair very easily with my dead system.

397
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,920
Or are they saying that when you buy this in a year from now, when it actually lands

398
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,520
on your door, then they'll be supporting it full-time?

399
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,700
Yeah, it is a pre-order and it is quote, available soon.

400
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:19,320
So just as I'm finally receiving my yellow, we'll see how long it takes me to get my SkyConnect.

401
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,000
Linode.com slash SSH.

402
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,600
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account.

403
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,880
It's just a great way to support the show while you're checking out something awesome.

404
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,920
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting with the best support in the business.

405
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,120
Real humans every day.

406
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,360
It's how we run everything we've built in the last few years in the cloud, like our

407
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
brand new website.

408
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,400
Got to go check it out, jupyterbroadcasting.com.

409
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,320
We use it in our personal environments.

410
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,280
We use it in our testing environments and we use it in our production environments because

411
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,160
Linode's tooling makes it really straightforward to do all of that.

412
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,680
And Linode was built nearly 19 years ago and they just added better and better things.

413
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
They've improved.

414
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,120
They've refined the service over the years.

415
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,420
So now, like, we're riding on top of years and years and years of investment.

416
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,040
We get all of that as just part of the product.

417
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,120
And Linode is still 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers that want to lock you into

418
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,200
their crazy platforms that are just secondary to their main business.

419
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,880
And on top of that, I think Linode has the best performance out there.

420
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,920
And independent testing is also showing that.

421
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,720
And right now, today, Linode has 11 data centers for you to choose from.

422
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,320
And that's a whole bunch all over the world.

423
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,880
And coming soon, there's going to be more than a dozen new Linode data centers firing

424
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,200
up across the world.

425
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
That's just going to be insane.

426
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
You're going to have so much choice.

427
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,080
And you know, Linode really is just the perfect balance of support, performance, and price.

428
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,760
So with that $100, you get a chance to see it for yourself.

429
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,120
That really is an opportunity to kick the tires and try it.

430
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,680
So go build something, go learn something, go experiment with something, and support

431
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
the show.

432
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Try it for yourself.

433
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,080
Get your $100 at linode.com slash SSH.

434
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
One more time.

435
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
That's linode.com slash SSH.

436
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:03,120
We're trying to review an app that I've actually put in the show notes more times than I can

437
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
actually remember.

438
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,120
We just never quite seem to get to it.

439
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,260
This time, finally, Invoice Ninja has made the cut into the show.

440
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,240
So I thought it would be good because I know, Brent, you do quite a lot of freelancing stuff

441
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,320
with your photography and other things, you know, podcast related stuff.

442
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
So you're always sending invoices to people.

443
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:25,540
So I thought whilst we had you on the show, it would be a good time to discuss Invoice

444
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,540
Ninja.

445
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:31,160
Now, this is a piece of software that allows you to create customizable and nicely designed

446
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,120
invoices and quotes.

447
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:40,200
So essentially, whenever I do a piece of freelance work for somebody, I create a customer in

448
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,160
the Invoice Ninja software.

449
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,640
And then I create a product, you know, like a podcast episode, for example, or something

450
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,640
like that.

451
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,280
And then I put in there, you know, what the product is, it could be a physical thing,

452
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,760
it could be a service, whatever.

453
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,960
And it has a rate attached to it, a standard rate, which I can go in and customize if I

454
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
want to.

455
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,160
But typically, it doesn't change that much between clients.

456
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,400
After that, it automatically generates the invoice based on my information and the client's

457
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,040
information.

458
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,820
And if you get fancy and set up email with it, which I've never done, I always just download

459
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:18,040
the PDF once it's generated the invoice and stick it in my email manually, but it can

460
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,000
actually send emails directly from the Invoice Ninja software to the client, which is a really

461
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
nice feature.

462
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,600
Alex, you're right to include me because I have a lot of questions.

463
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,080
Okay, far away.

464
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,040
Okay, you've been using this for how long now?

465
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,160
I think it's been like two years if I remember.

466
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,120
Two years plus however long it is since I set you up with your instance that is probably

467
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,720
dead by now.

468
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,920
You did send me a backup.

469
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,160
So thank you for that.

470
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
Okay.

471
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Okay, good.

472
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,120
Yeah, Alex, you you shared with me invoice into I think when you first found it, or maybe

473
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,600
you were a few months in and you were crazy excited about it, and I did get the chance

474
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
to try it.

475
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Yeah, it's it's years old in my workflow.

476
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,120
Now at this point, everything you described your introduction just there is not something

477
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,300
that I think is unique.

478
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,600
I'm curious from your perspective.

479
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,360
What are the things that you're really loving about this?

480
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,360
Is it that?

481
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,160
Is it the fact that you can self host it really easily?

482
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,240
Is it the fact that it's really responsive?

483
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,640
Is it the interface?

484
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,960
What is it about it that really grabs you?

485
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,120
Yeah, I didn't touch much on the actual mechanics of hosting this thing.

486
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,360
The invoice ninja project actually has hosted options which you can pay monthly for.

487
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,160
However, I don't do that I have a fully self hosted version that lives on my server.

488
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,120
This thing requires three containers.

489
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,280
So there's the app container, there's a database container, which in my case, I'm using my

490
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,420
sequel.

491
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,000
And then there's a front end, which in my case, I'm using nginx, which I then proxy

492
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
through traffic.

493
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,560
So I tell you what I like about it just as a piece of software.

494
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,840
It looks nice.

495
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,680
Yeah, I'll agree with that.

496
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,760
I like the fact that when I create an invoice, it gives me a little chart that says you're

497
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,680
owed $500 this month.

498
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:01,840
And then until you mark that invoice as received or paid, it will show you a pending number

499
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,600
versus a last 30 day number versus a, you know, 90 day number or whatever you want.

500
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,960
So I could see this being very useful for people who are actually sending hundreds of

501
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,800
invoices every day, less useful for me who sends maybe one a month or two a month.

502
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:21,760
But it's still nice to have a record of everything I've ever sent in one place.

503
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:28,240
The other thing that I like about it too, is that I can tweak stuff.

504
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:33,000
And I feel like I'm using a really, I'm driving a really powerful sports car.

505
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,280
And I'm okay, I'm only puting down the road at 30 miles an hour.

506
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,760
But it's nice to know that it's got all of that other stuff there should I ever need

507
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,760
it.

508
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
Yeah.

509
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,640
And I think too, it's it's pretty quick that the pricing on a lot of the hosted invoicing

510
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,720
can get really expensive.

511
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,760
You know, I have been a customer of FreshBooks for a long time.

512
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,000
But I think I'm paying some somewhere near 50 bucks a month or something like that 60

513
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,600
bucks a month for the package, well, JB does not me, but it's actually kind of a good deal

514
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,740
for a lot of these things.

515
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:08,360
People pay astronomical prices for QuickBooks and the invoicing components.

516
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,360
So there's that aspect of invoice, besides the UI, and besides the self hosting and tinkering,

517
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,300
there's the cost savings too.

518
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,760
In addition, it does a whole bunch of other stuff.

519
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,240
So I can set up things like recurring invoices, if I want to in a separate area from individual

520
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
invoices.

521
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,600
I can record manually all the payments that come in and attach those to specific invoices

522
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,800
if I want to.

523
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,000
I can also do things like quotes and proposals and set up specific projects and attach different

524
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,760
things within invoice ninja to different projects and what have you which, you know, if I was,

525
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,100
I don't know, let's say running a home improvement company, that could be quite useful to have

526
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:51,080
different quotes for the same person within a single project, for example, something like

527
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,080
that.

528
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,600
I can also do things like track different vendors.

529
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,240
So I can say, well, this vendor, I've sent them this money for this product.

530
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,640
And like I say, it's, it's an incredibly powerful piece of software that I'm really only scratching

531
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:11,200
the surface of by pretty much only using the invoice portion of it.

532
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,440
But it has the ability to run some pretty sophisticated reporting as well.

533
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,640
So again, if I was a bit more of a serious small business owner or something like that,

534
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:25,440
which I'm not, I could, you know, let's say give me the last, you know, every invoice

535
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,240
this year to a specific client or something like that.

536
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,040
And it'll just show me all those things in one place.

537
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,920
Now, Alex, have you used anything else for invoicing or is this kind of your first foray

538
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,400
into this style of software to help you accomplish things?

539
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,160
I used to just have a Google sheet that I've, you know, manually changed and filled out

540
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,160
things for a long time.

541
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,960
Which is also very powerful.

542
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,400
It can be, but it's also, you know, you don't really have a record unless you do a new sheet

543
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,440
per invoice or something of what you've done.

544
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,240
But this is the first kind of invoicing suite, I guess, that I've used.

545
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,880
Because many of the features you described are, yeah, they're great.

546
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
They're not unique.

547
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,400
But what I have found when I used Invoice Ninja was that they're very well implemented.

548
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,640
And like you mentioned, they allowed you to really tweak a lot of things.

549
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:23,120
I have been using for many years a piece of software called Invoice Plane, and it is far

550
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
more basic.

551
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:29,920
It is self-hosted, and I have some automated emails and stuff sending out of there.

552
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:35,160
But I do find after having used Invoice Ninja, thanks to you, that I feel it's lacking now.

553
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,120
And every time I use it, I'm like, oh, God, I really gotta switch over.

554
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,840
I gotta change this.

555
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,560
So I think you made probably a really nice choice in choosing your first piece of software

556
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,400
because often, the hardest part is taking all that information out of these pieces of

557
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,440
software and switching to something new.

558
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,000
That's one thing I really struggle with.

559
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,940
And so have you investigated at all what the importing and exporting parts of this database

560
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,480
might look like and what that's like to port to something new, if you so choose?

561
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:11,260
Well, I just, whilst we were talking just then, exported a CSV report of every invoice

562
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,260
that I've sent this year.

563
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,200
So let's just take a quick look at that.

564
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,920
All numbers, of course, is gonna be a real fun time.

565
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,120
So the CSV is exactly what you'd expect.

566
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,920
It's just a bunch of this client, this date, this invoice number, this amount, status,

567
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,500
all that kind of stuff.

568
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:33,880
And so if you can get it out to a format that you own, like a CSV file, there's no QuickBooks

569
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,960
or FreshBooks kind of proprietary license required.

570
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,240
That's a huge thing for me, given I just do this as a spare time thing.

571
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,680
But yeah, I think CSV seems to be pretty good.

572
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,320
I haven't actually done anything with importing though.

573
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,760
Well, I have another question for you.

574
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,920
I overheard when I was at your place last that your wife, Catherine, has been using

575
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
it as well.

576
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,280
Did you get any feedback from her using it in her business?

577
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:07,720
Yeah, I think it's massive overkill for just invoicing a few music students, parents, but

578
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,720
she likes it.

579
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,720
I mean, she has her own login.

580
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,920
You know, has a shortcut on her browser's bookmarks.

581
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,800
She just logs in and just does the thing and like I do once a month, I guess, and just

582
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,360
sends the invoice out and it's all good.

583
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,160
I've just found the import data pane, by the way, and it supports a huge number of different

584
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
formats.

585
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,840
You've got CSV, JSON, FreshBooks, blah, blah, blah.

586
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,120
Invoice plane is one of them, I would just say.

587
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:40,160
There's about 10 or 12 different options for importing and exporting is CSV, XLS or JSON.

588
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
Sounds like you've got me hooked.

589
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Yeah, there's no downside.

590
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
I can see.

591
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
Next.

592
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,160
Yeah.

593
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,520
And even if you try it and you don't like it, it sounds like it's pretty easy to get

594
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,520
out.

595
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,360
So it's no real downside to trying it.

596
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,280
I know a lot of people listening to this show probably love their Yubikey.

597
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,800
I've heard from some of them.

598
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,640
And it sounds like Cloudflare is going to work with Yubikeys.

599
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,320
I didn't know they didn't tell us all about this one, Alex.

600
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,120
Well, the first thing about Yubikeys, we should explain what they are for those that don't

601
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
know.

602
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,480
They're a hardware two-factor authentication token.

603
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,240
So essentially what that means is whenever you log into a specific login portal, website,

604
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,440
piece of software, whatever that needs 2FA, that six digit code or whatever, it could

605
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,480
be an alphanumeric string in the case of a Yubikey.

606
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:33,600
You have to physically plug in a USB device into your computer or your phone via NFC.

607
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,240
The two-factor piece is stored in the hardware of the Yubikey.

608
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,640
That has a few benefits, obviously, unless someone has physical access to my hardware

609
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,240
two-factor token, they can't log in.

610
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,800
The downside is that includes me.

611
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:57,600
And what I found when I got a free Yubikey back at DockerCon in 2015, I think, because

612
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,120
they were doing some push to get people to sign Docker images back then.

613
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,160
So I tried it for a while because you can load SSH keys onto this thing as well.

614
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,400
Secrets can include a private key, all that kind of stuff.

615
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,080
Even your Bitwarden two-factor authentication token can be stored and set up to work with

616
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,600
a Yubikey.

617
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,400
The trouble is my Yubikey is always at the wrong end of the house.

618
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,820
It's always at the opposite end of the house from where I am.

619
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,220
And so whenever I want to log into something, I'm like, damn it, I have to run from one

620
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,400
end of the house to the other or just have multiple Yubikeys.

621
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,780
I feel like there's some universal law about two-factor and the device you're using is

622
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,440
always at the other end of the house.

623
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,720
Yeah, that's true.

624
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,360
I remember our friend Noah wears it around his neck for that very reason.

625
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,640
I mean, so it's not to say that they're not good because they're incredibly useful in

626
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,720
the workplace.

627
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,200
For example, you want to give someone access to some privileged secrets.

628
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,680
You give them this hardware token and at work, typically that's the most common use case

629
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,440
for it, I would say.

630
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,320
And so what Cloudflare are doing is they're running a promotion with Yubikey to provide

631
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:12,800
these security keys at air quotes, good for the internet end quotes pricing and they start

632
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,120
as low as $10 per Yubikey.

633
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,720
Now typically these things are 30, 40 plus each.

634
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,680
So actually that could be a huge boon if you've been looking to get involved with the YubiCo

635
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:29,520
Yubikey stuff, sign up to this offer that's in the show notes with Cloudflare, it's not

636
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,280
sponsored or affiliated, it's just a Cloudflare thing and get yourself a cheap Yubikey.

637
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,160
Good for the internet pricing is adorable.

638
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,280
I thought we're supposed to hate Cloudflare, but I can't help but think this is a good

639
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,280
idea.

640
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,880
This is truly good for the security of the internet.

641
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,880
You know, Chris, I did find a Yubikey in your closet one time.

642
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,920
I think the last time I was here, um, Brent, you're going through my closet?

643
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,800
No, no, I just, well, we'll talk about it later.

644
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:03,760
You know, there used to be lots of reasons not to use Yubikey's laziness, being at the

645
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,880
wrong end of the house is one of them, but they didn't used to make a USB-C specific

646
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,880
one that was low profile for like MacBooks and stuff.

647
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,880
They fixed that.

648
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,080
That's now a low profile one for MacBooks.

649
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,800
They didn't used to work on mobile devices, but they now do through NFC.

650
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,360
So really there's no real reason if you're curious not to try one at a $10 entry price.

651
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,880
That is a really good point.

652
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,980
I've looked at these keys many times, both the Yubikeys and alternatives, and I've always

653
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:38,480
hesitated to pull the trigger on price because actually you kind of need two of them.

654
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,000
One is your main, one is the backup.

655
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,200
But the other reason was always that I couldn't quite figure out all of the different features

656
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,840
and you know, which, is it Fido that I need to support everything?

657
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:54,240
It's like, it seemed like 12 websites use this one proprietary way of doing it, and

658
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,920
the other 12 use this other method.

659
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,380
So I always got lost in all of those details and complexity, and I hope that maybe that's

660
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,380
been solved recently.

661
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:06,320
Do you have any sense of whether they're easier these days than they were maybe five years

662
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,320
ago?

663
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,660
I think they're more mature and they support a lot more stuff than they used to.

664
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,480
I don't know whether that makes it simpler or more approachable though.

665
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,880
If anything, it makes it worse because there's more options.

666
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,880
That's where I kind of debate, like maybe the, maybe the sweet spot is like an authenticator

667
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,440
app on your phone, but I do kind of, I love that idea of you plug in a hardware device

668
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,080
that does something and it feels like you'd really want to combine a two factor code on

669
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:36,260
an authentication app with a hardware device with a password potentially.

670
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,200
Or as a backup, you know, when places do SMS phishing attacks and stuff, that's one of

671
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:47,520
the most common attack vectors is people steal your SMS access, send a two factor code there

672
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,440
whilst they have the temporary access before you notice.

673
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,560
And this would completely negate that as an attack vector.

674
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,320
But only if supported.

675
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,500
Only if supported.

676
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:03,160
This takes me back to a few years ago where the company I worked at used Yubikeys and

677
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:08,280
in Slack multiple times a day, different people accidentally touched their Yubikeys and put

678
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:16,760
in their, you know, 40 character long string, most of the days.

679
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
I have seen that.

680
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,680
I see that in our chat room sometimes too.

681
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,540
I did it one time.

682
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,960
And Alex, you've, you've sent some of your passwords to GitHub if I remember correctly.

683
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,240
Oh, well that's, that's different.

684
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,360
That's just me being, being an idiot, but that's different.

685
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,920
What's the difference?

686
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,360
Well these strings aren't useful on their own because they're attached to a specific

687
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,240
service and they're time limited and all that kind of stuff.

688
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,960
So if you happen to know exactly what service I'm logging into at that specific moment in

689
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,560
history, maybe it's useful for about the next 25 seconds, but otherwise it's useless.

690
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,840
Well I want to talk about something you came across that really piques my interest because

691
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:59,080
I'm often using Reddit as a way to discover topics that seem like might be worth discussion.

692
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,840
And you found essentially an automatic archiver for Reddit.

693
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
I did.

694
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:06,680
I haven't actually tried it out yet, but there's a piece of software in the show notes linked

695
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,080
called Expanse.

696
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:15,000
And this builds itself as a fully self-hosted multi-user web app, which allows you to externally

697
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,880
store Reddit items such as things you've saved, created, upvoted, downvoted and hidden.

698
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,760
And this bypasses Reddit's 1000 item listing limit, which I didn't know was a limit.

699
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,400
And so essentially there's a quick demo in the GitHub repo, short YouTube video, and

700
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,400
that was enough to sell me.

701
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
I'm hooked.

702
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,880
I will set this up the earliest opportunity.

703
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
Same.

704
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,280
What the video really demonstrates is it creates like a mirrored environment of Reddit.

705
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,800
So you kind of create some of the same categories of saved post, upvoted post, downvoted, submitted,

706
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,800
commented.

707
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,720
You know, that same kind of thing you get from your Reddit history.

708
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:55,320
It mirrors that UI in a cleaner way and just presents all that information to you.

709
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,460
And it just continues to just suck that information into your own local instance as you use Reddit

710
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,840
like you normally might.

711
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,560
You don't have to do anything special.

712
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,480
Pretty much like Pocket for Reddit.

713
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,480
Yeah.

714
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,160
Like if, but like if everything you read just automatically went to Pocket or something,

715
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,400
because it's everything you do on Reddit just automatically gets backed up to this thing.

716
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,400
It's kind of brilliant.

717
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,000
I wish I had that for all the services.

718
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Yeah.

719
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Can we get that for Hacker News?

720
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Yeah.

721
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Well, we can give you that.

722
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,780
We can give you anything that's really like all the services for everything.

723
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,280
Have you heard of RSS?

724
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:34,840
I see you found out that Bitwarden has integrated Fastmail email aliasing.

725
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:42,460
So that way, when you sign up now you can generate a fastmail unique email address for

726
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,360
a service.

727
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,360
How great is this?

728
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,680
Well, this is amazing.

729
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:52,040
know that Google supports the plus delimiter in their email

730
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:58,040
addresses. So you can say, Alex KTZ plus Twitter at Gmail or

731
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:04,500
whatever, and it will send every email that Twitter has to that

732
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,200
specific email address. The trouble is it relies on the

733
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,120
service that's in question Twitter or whoever, to respect

734
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,280
that. And then also when they sell that information to third

735
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:22,000
parties at whatever point Elon decides to in the future, they've

736
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,080
also got to include that plus in there because everybody knows

737
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,040
that plus is just a delimiter. And so the real email address is

738
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,000
just a bit before the plus. What this fast mail integration

739
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,360
allows me to do is set up a genuine email alias. So you

740
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,240
know, becomes two or three random words and a couple of

741
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,520
random numbers instead of my actual email address being semi

742
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,840
obfuscated. And it's built directly into the Bitwarden

743
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,560
clients. So they have that generate password feature. If

744
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,760
you if you look at the checkbox, the next one down is now a

745
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,360
generate username box, which we've talked about before. But

746
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,240
if you look just a little bit further down than that, there's

747
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,120
three or four services in there and one of them is now fast

748
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:13,400
mail. And so just by creating or generating an email address

749
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,640
alias in the Bitwarden client, it will go and talk to the fast

750
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,000
mail API create the email alias. And then from that point in

751
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,160
history, you have a routable email address that is not your

752
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,960
real email address, but is the alias. It's it's brilliant.

753
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,360
You know, it feels to me like we are creating a huge void between

754
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,960
two worlds. We now have, you know, most of us hopefully, who

755
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,160
are well educated about passwords using password

756
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,840
managers, you know, you mentioned YubiKey earlier, all

757
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,560
of these things that are really great, but then I feel like most

758
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,000
people are just not even anywhere close to using a unique

759
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,680
email address for each service. I think we need to figure out

760
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,680
how to bridge that gap.

761
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,400
Well, the tooling helps, you know, building the tooling to

762
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,440
do it. I think that's what this I think that's what this is

763
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,760
trying to do, isn't it? Mm hmm.

764
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,120
Yeah, I think you're right. Yeah. Okay, you win. I've been

765
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,080
I mean, this is not a sponsored thing. I've been trying to get

766
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,200
Brent on Bitwarden for weeks. The man loves his key pass.

767
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,760
You know, what I like about it is that it's worked for the last

768
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,840
15 years, and I don't need to question it. And but I've been

769
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,160
trying to find that key reason that will make me switch and

770
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:25,920
maybe this is it.

771
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,000
I think the key reason will be when you decide it's time. If I

772
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,720
know anything about about you, Brent, it's that you have to

773
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,560
decide it's a good idea before you'll do something.

774
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,760
Shouldn't that be all of us?

775
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,840
Yeah, technically, technically. I think it might be time for some

776
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,480
feedback, gentlemen. What do you think?

777
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,480
Bring it on. We've been getting a lot of various tail scale

778
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,360
alternatives sent into the show. And at first, I was like, okay,

779
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,120
okay. But what's coming a couple of times has been net-based

780
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,400
and I don't know if either one of you guys have seen this, but

781
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,160
netbird is trying to check all the boxes. And I hope the tail

782
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,400
scale team takes this as a compliment because this is

783
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,360
clearly an indication that they're on to something that all

784
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,960
of these open source projects have cropped up. And I suppose

785
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,680
for a lot of folks, headscale has not been sufficient, I

786
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,400
guess. But the netbird folks are attempting to get as close as

787
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,360
you can to a WireGuard based mesh network. They're supporting

788
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,480
single sign on and multi-factor authentication like tail scale

789
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,600
does. They have some simple controls. I don't think they

790
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,960
have the install down quite as smooth as tail scale does, but

791
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,840
really, who would right? But you get a lot of it, you get a lot

792
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:41,080
of the advantages. But you know, it's 100% a well, it doesn't

793
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:43,520
have to be actually, they're also offering their own hosted

794
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,840
implementation as well, of course, which then I'm not even

795
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,480
sure why it's even better than tail scale. But they do have a

796
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,920
by default, a host implementation, but they make it

797
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,360
really clear how to do all your own self hosting if you like.

798
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,960
This is why we were also excited about WireGuard being put in the

799
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:01,960
Linux kernel a few years ago. It legitimized the project. And we

800
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,400
hoped at the time that it would lead to this proliferation of

801
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,480
solutions based upon it for VPN stuff. I'm so pleased to see

802
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,280
that that's coming true. Aren't you?

803
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,960
Yeah, absolutely. And it looks like, you know, we're gonna have

804
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,560
a spoil of choices. So I wonder if we'll go through a period of

805
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,480
some of these sort of proving themselves out and tail scale

806
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:26,640
will probably be a leader for a while. Because they got a huge

807
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,880
start. They have a commercial entity behind them that has some

808
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,920
money. And they got a good product, right. But so now

809
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,320
you're gonna see a lot of, I'd say, kind of not clones, but

810
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,480
this kind of kind of what they are, right. And we're gonna have

811
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,360
to see which one kind of wins out. And I think that's going to

812
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,640
be interesting to see which one wins out. And which one ends up

813
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,120
being the most popular in the community? Will it be tail scale

814
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,360
and headscale for those that want self hosting? Or will it be

815
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,960
something like netbird? So if you tried something like this

816
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,760
out there, let us know send us a boost or go to self hosted that

817
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,600
show slash contact and let us know your thoughts. I am just so

818
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,480
happy with tail scale. And now that I'm doing subnet routing,

819
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,600
and all of that I I'm really, I'm really quite pleased. I don't

820
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,800
really see any particular reason to switch. And I'm also totally

821
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,840
in managing some of the authentication and some of the

822
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,080
connecting that's fine for me because I want this to work like

823
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,840
a rock. We talked a little bit about the subnet routing at the

824
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:28,360
Airbnb in Pasadena with our questionable Wi Fi situation.

825
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,400
That's generous. And it's fascinating. I use the heck out

826
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,040
of the subnet routing. It's amazing. Oh, it's so handy,

827
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,240
especially for devices that aren't PCs or Raspberry Pi is

828
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,680
that you something you can't install software on like my

829
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,160
Victor on solar equipment and battery equipment. I can't

830
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,360
install tail scale on that it's an appliance. But I have tail

831
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:54,520
scale on my Raspberry Pi that's on the same land and I have

832
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,160
subnet routing on. So now I'm like checking the solar when

833
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,040
we're at the Airbnb making sure jupes is doing okay. And then

834
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,920
you know, I wanted to check the temperatures at the studio. So I

835
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,280
have tail scale installed from hacks on Home Assistant with

836
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,040
subnet routing turned on. And so I'm checking the temperatures in

837
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,680
the garage to make sure the server is okay. And I'm just

838
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,280
using local IPS for all of it. And I'm pleased to say that I I

839
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,000
did hope one day that this would exist that this world would be

840
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,760
real. And so I preemptively set the RV network to a 17 to 16

841
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:36,560
subnet. And the studio is a 192 168 seven subnet. And so the two

842
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,400
are very different. And that has made life like so just made it

843
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,360
ready to go. Yeah,

844
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,900
when Brent was here, I had to completely re change my retool

845
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:48,180
my cider my IP range in the house because there was some

846
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,860
overlap between my house here and my dad's Starlink network

847
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,460
because remember, I moaned in an episode, I couldn't change the

848
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,820
ACP range. So I had to completely retool. So that's

849
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,540
some good foresight from you there, Christopher. I tell you

850
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:00,820
what,

851
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:04,700
the old days, the old days of VPNing like an animal building

852
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,060
flat networks. But let us know if you try out netbird, I'd be

853
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,500
really curious to hear how it goes.

854
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,400
Yeah, same. And I think in a future episode, we might do a

855
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,120
bit bit more of a deep dive into the subnet routing that that I'm

856
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:19,400
doing and the split DNS between different sites, because I think

857
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,080
that'd be of interest to folks. So if you're interested in that,

858
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,600
let us know at self hosted dot show slash contact.

859
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,200
I agree. Having chatted a little bit about it at the Airbnb, I

860
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,120
think it would be a great topic. We got some boosts into the show

861
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:36,480
two and have boosted in with over 9000 9001 sats. And we also

862
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,600
got 1024 sats from Amar, who's having some trouble getting

863
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,120
their audio whole home audio working. So these are these are

864
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,200
our whole home audio boosts that I wanted to follow up on. So

865
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,020
we'll start with Nav and he writes, whole home audio as a

866
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:54,240
concept has existed as long as human history. So there are

867
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,240
plenty of solutions moving around. Rather than getting

868
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,920
fancy with software, I might present an alternative he

869
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,600
writes, pulse audios, network streaming, and Cody. Now why

870
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,320
Cody, because Cody has a rich app ecosystem for remote

871
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,680
controls and a web GUI. Plus, it supports Plex jellyfin MB, and

872
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:19,000
even aircast. This solution I have been using for years now,

873
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:22,880
I would never have thought of Cody, would you know, and I

874
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,760
think it's probably worth a mention because a lot of people

875
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,040
love Cody that listen to the show. And pulse audio network

876
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,960
streaming has been around for years, and I never think to

877
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,700
mention it. But I constantly hear feedback from the audience

878
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,280
that it works pretty well. Just anything with pulse audio gives

879
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,480
me PTSD, I think rustic as diverse boosted with 2000 sats.

880
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:47,180
And he echoed a sentiment we heard from multiple people out

881
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:51,440
there. What about vol milio or volumio? Sorry, I'm butchering

882
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,360
that. But it acts as an Airplay Chromecast endpoint. He says if

883
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,000
you want a lot of them synced, you'd have to pay but it's a

884
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,240
good projects was worth paying for. I had a couple of

885
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,320
recommendations for volumio. Actually, the pricing doesn't

886
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,120
put me off too much. I don't mind necessarily paying for the

887
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,960
right solution. I mean, the alternative would be just giving

888
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,560
up and going for a Sonos based deployment, right and that that

889
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,880
ain't gonna be free, is it? So the other thing that came in as

890
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,400
a recommendation was there's a chap on YouTube called Darko

891
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,860
that does he's got beautiful production quality on his

892
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:31,800
videos. He is a hi fi audio file nerd. And he talks occasionally

893
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,920
about how he streams music around his house. One of the

894
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,840
recommendations I had come in was something called rune audio.

895
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,320
It's not open source, I don't think. And it is paid does cost

896
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:45,200
quite a bit per month. But you know, this will support along

897
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,680
with volumio multiple rooms based off of Raspberry Pi and

898
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,640
that kind of thing. I'm still stuck though, on how to actually

899
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,400
automate the speaker component. The Raspberry Pi bit I think is

900
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,080
actually the easy bit. I mean, there's a few options, you know,

901
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:04,760
snapcast is another one out there. It's just controlling the

902
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,160
speaker component. That's the tricky bit. The Broadlink

903
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,640
infrared emitter blaster that I talked about in the last episode

904
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,920
sort of kind of is behaving itself. But I've ordered the

905
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,200
components to build myself a blaster based off an ESP device

906
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,920
as well. See if that's any better than the Broadlink stuff

907
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,560
because it's not, it's just not reliable enough. Yeah, thanks

908
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,000
for the recommendation. I'll take a look at volumio a bit

909
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,040
more seriously over the next next few weeks when I'm not

910
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,040
traveling to LA.

911
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,560
The shame to hear you're having some trouble with the IR blaster

912
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,680
because when you're doing the music stuff, and you just you

913
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,760
just want to hit a button and have it go, you know, you want

914
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,160
it to be a really kind of chill experience. That's not, it's not

915
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,560
when you want to do the troubleshooting.

916
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,680
It seems to me like the intersection of two very

917
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:51,880
different worlds, you know, the the hardware button, audio file

918
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,440
grade box that's sitting, you know, next to your TV or your

919
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:59,520
entertainment system feels like maybe high end technology of a

920
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:03,200
very different era. And you're trying to kind of marry the two.

921
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,080
So I understand there's clearly some some challenge there. But

922
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,560
wouldn't it be great if they just made friends?

923
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,600
Quick code wanted to know if anybody has any tips on content

924
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,040
request systems for music, you know, how there's things out

925
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:22,000
there like overseer and other tools for like books and stuff

926
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,840
like that. If anybody has suggestions for music, send them

927
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:30,960
into the show. And then drew oof, or Dr. oof, boosted in with

928
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,960
5678 sats. And he wanted to give a plus one to the zoos z wave

929
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,640
switches, specifically the 700 series. Thank you very much for

930
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,960
that detail. He says I've been through a bunch of different

931
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,840
brands of smart switches over the years. And the zoos have

932
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,520
been that zoos have been the most reliable, affordable and

933
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,880
configurable to date. I'm a network security engineer by

934
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,720
trade. And I've an enterprise grade Wi Fi throughout my house

935
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,920
and property for different APS. And even that can't keep up with

936
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,640
my smart switches. Interesting. My house is long and narrow. So

937
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,520
it just turns out 900 megahertz mesh network works better than

938
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:11,480
Wi Fi. Thanks for the great podcast. I do love 900 mega

939
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:17,560
hertz. I love 900 megahertz radio so much. I wish we could

940
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,360
have stayed there. mega strike three boosted in with 3000 sats

941
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,200
Hey, Chris and Alex love the show. I picked up an IKEA ZigBee

942
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,320
light bulb. As I begin to build out my smart home. Any

943
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,080
recommendations for a home assistant ZigBee router?

944
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,800
Currently, I'm looking at the con be two thanks, as always.

945
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,600
Well, he's already got my recommendation that can be I use

946
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:43,600
the really cheap sewn off one to start with. And it was it was

947
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:49,200
not good. It was just not good. But the con be two has been my

948
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,400
favorite phrase rock solid since I installed it.

949
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,480
You know what, though, I agree. In fact, I don't even have like

950
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,760
mine hanging off a dongle. It's just like hooked up right to the

951
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,680
back of my home assistant blue in the studio. And I'm talking

952
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,920
to devices that are on the other end of the house. I will also

953
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:11,160
link to the Zalesh ZigBee 3.0 stick that cloud free.shop sells

954
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,080
because I would imagine if cloud free is selling that that's

955
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,880
probably a pretty good device. But I to own the con be two USB

956
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,680
ZigBee gateway and have been very happy with it and home

957
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,280
assistant just picked it up right away. So that was really

958
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:24,840
nice.

959
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,640
Don't forget, we still got a coupon code over at cloud free

960
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,280
dot shop. If you put self hosted in there, you'll probably get a

961
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,440
dollar off whatever you're buying.

962
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,960
At user 3513 boosted in with 8192 sets. I'd love to know how

963
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,240
Alex is running Proxmox and Docker on a systems. Are you

964
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:45,120
running an Ubuntu VM on top of Proxmox? Or containers? Did you

965
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,280
use a bare metal Linux and then somehow hack the packages to

966
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,800
install Proxmox onto it? Tell user 3513 Alex,

967
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,360
you know,

968
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:57,880
this question has been coming up in discord a lot in the last

969
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:03,360
month or so. And it's like something has changed and people

970
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,240
just need to need to know exactly what I'm doing to copy

971
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,360
it, which I don't understand.

972
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,640
They can't buy pies anymore. So they're finally giving in and

973
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,920
buying x86 systems and going Proxmox.

974
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,360
They are very sensible people, you know, they should, you know,

975
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:21,240
you should you should consider doing that. Perfect media

976
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,880
server.com would be where I'd send people for actual

977
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:28,280
documentation on what I'm doing. I put a new page up there in

978
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:33,760
May, I think badgers stack in in May, just to just to tell

979
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,560
because I got was getting so many questions. What are you

980
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,280
doing, Alex? What are you doing? And I'm like, well, okay, here

981
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,440
it is. Here's the hardware. I'm using the exact hardware, the

982
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,480
CPU, the the OS, all that kind of stuff. So in the original

983
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,400
perfect meter server guides, I used to recommend virtualizing

984
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,640
Ubuntu, and then passing through all of the drive

985
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,200
controllers to those virtual machines. That was in the days

986
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:02,480
before I was an absolute quick sync snob. And if you recall in

987
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,880
the show, a long time ago, also, I've written blog posts about

988
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,040
it. And it's on perfect media server.com. I was I was trying

989
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:16,880
to do something called GVTG to split the quick sync GPU, the

990
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,920
IGPU up between multiple virtual machines and pass it through

991
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,120
and all that kind of stuff. It just didn't work. The

992
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,720
performance was no good. And the complexity was off the charts.

993
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,480
And you know how it goes. So essentially, I decided at that

994
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,920
point, I've got no option if I want hardware transcoding using

995
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:40,560
quicksync, rather than having my Jules Eon box pull 400 watts, I

996
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,760
only want to pull four watts when I'm doing a transcode. And

997
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:47,880
who wouldn't want that? I've got to run Plex on the host. And

998
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:52,480
that's it. That really drove the next wave of my builds, which

999
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,800
I've been doing now for about 18 months, I would say. All of my

1000
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,040
containers run directly on the host. Home Assistant itself

1001
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:03,760
runs as a has OS VM, or whatever they call it these days. That's

1002
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,200
the only VM I have in Proxmox is literally just Home Assistant.

1003
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,840
It's a bit of a waste. I mean, occasionally I spin up a, you

1004
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,440
know, an Ubuntu thing for testing or fedora thing or

1005
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,080
whatever, just literally for testing. But in terms of

1006
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,480
production, everything's on the Proxmox host. It's all done in

1007
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,080
Ansible in my GitHub repo, which I'll put a link to in the show

1008
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:28,200
notes as well. And it's just really simple. It's just an

1009
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,040
install of Debian with Proxmox installed on top of it. I used

1010
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:35,880
the Proxmox documentation to achieve that. There's not much

1011
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,040
to it. It's just Linux, really. It's very boring.

1012
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,800
I think that's a good thing. I was we were talking before we

1013
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,320
hit record. I'm like, you know, there's a lot of things about

1014
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,680
Linux are getting boring, but that's what you need when it

1015
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:50,240
becomes like this layer in the industry. It just needs to work.

1016
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:53,400
So that's great. And we'll have a link to Alex's high level

1017
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:58,680
overview in the notes, including some links to also, as Alex is

1018
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,840
adding them right now to documentation on how to get

1019
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,480
Proxmox running on Debian 11.

1020
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:03,520
The Badger Stack.

1021
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,040
The Badger Stack.

1022
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:10,160
Well, it can be confusing because Proxmox provide an ISO

1023
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,000
directly so you can install Proxmox directly from an ISO

1024
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,000
just, you know, from the project. Or you can install

1025
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,200
Debian and then install Proxmox on top of it. And that can

1026
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,560
confuse some people. Either route is completely valid. One

1027
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:28,360
is slightly more hands on there than the other. There's no real

1028
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,360
preference in my mind as to which one works better. Just do

1029
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:33,280
whatever makes you feel warm and cozy.

1030
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,960
I'm wondering how you feel about this next one, Alex, John A

1031
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:40,600
boosting with 10,000 SATs. And he after listening to the last

1032
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:44,840
episode is yoloing into setting up his own email server. No.

1033
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,960
Yeah, yeah. He also was checking out pod verse, which is awesome

1034
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,240
new podcast apps. And we also heard from P4 P4, John, who

1035
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,280
says, I've started self hosting my own email server this year.

1036
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,720
I got a business Comcast connection with a static IP. And

1037
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,400
I'm using, you know, host. It's going great. We're somehow when

1038
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,600
we say, I don't know if it's a good idea. People are like,

1039
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,880
thanks, guys. I'm doing it. You guys are crazy.

1040
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,440
I don't think it's a good idea to send us a million dollars.

1041
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,240
That would be an awful idea, don't you?

1042
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:18,480
Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely a bad idea to know. So I see, you

1043
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,760
know, I just think it's interesting.

1044
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,320
So John, you can send us an email from your shiny new email

1045
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,920
server to tell us how it's going, huh? And if we receive

1046
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,640
it, we'll let you know. Right?

1047
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,640
Yeah, definitely. Also, let me know how the pod verse

1048
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,640
transition goes, John, I'm gonna expect a boost from pod verse in

1049
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,480
the future. Also, I just want to give a quick shout out. We got

1050
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,760
5555 sats from soul trust, sending in just some love for

1051
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,360
the show just wanted to wish us well, I thought that was nice.

1052
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:48,360
And then, right, you got this one right. Schmitzfeld, I think

1053
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:52,040
it was mitzvah, he says that he just want to send us a series

1054
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:56,440
of ducks, Huey, Louie, and Dewey. And we got 3000 sats from

1055
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:01,400
four legged emu, who says he's loving calyx on his pixel. So

1056
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,960
we get it. I switched to graphene. And now I'm hearing

1057
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,680
about calyx constantly. I heard you were testing graphene. So

1058
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,360
maybe you need to switch and text calyx. Maybe I should just

1059
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,920
go back to the iPhone because this is just it's too much. It's

1060
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,680
too much. But we do love the boost. We read all of them. We

1061
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,000
only feature some of them on the shows now just to keep things

1062
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,160
tight. But we do appreciate everybody who sends one in. If

1063
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,240
you'd like to boost the show, you can grab a new podcasting

1064
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,200
app new podcast apps.com. Or if you don't want to switch

1065
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,760
podcast apps, you can use breeze br ez. technology and keep your

1066
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,800
dang podcast app. I think probably Albie deserves a

1067
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,280
mention as well. Albie is a way to do it from the web. If you

1068
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:41,400
don't want to use a mobile app at all. And the Albie team seems

1069
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,320
to be really solid. They're creating some great open source

1070
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:46,760
code. I had a little call with one of their co founders. I

1071
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:50,400
really like where they're going a l b y for that. Can we give a

1072
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:55,920
little pluggy pug to office hours dot hair? Yeah, it's

1073
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,280
something about plugs and hair but office hours dot hair.

1074
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,400
Lucky episode 13. I think it was we covered our our some of

1075
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,200
the shenanigans on our trip. And then in the most recent Linux

1076
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,840
unplugged, we covered our JPL trip to which how great was the

1077
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:15,480
JPL trip? Alex, that was the JPL trip. I just can't process it.

1078
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,760
Did that really happen to us? Like we're just normal people.

1079
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,120
Something like that doesn't happen to normal people. Does

1080
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,400
it? It was so cool. And and to see the clipper to see them

1081
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:29,400
working on the next mission. The Europa clipper. Oh, so Chris

1082
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,400
last night to tuning into the live cam that you can get for

1083
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,480
there. Oh, cool. Yeah, on YouTube. Go look up the if you

1084
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,400
look up the Europa clipper stream. It's on there. I've

1085
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,640
checked it several times. And they've added a lot more to it

1086
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,280
since we saw it. Wow, that's, that's so cool. I'm just so

1087
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,920
grateful. I know I put a little clip in the next unplugged for

1088
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,880
you, saying how great the audience is. And it sounds like

1089
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,840
a cliche. But genuinely, I think you said it that it's amazing.

1090
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:58,360
We had, you know, 20 people show up for the tour and about double

1091
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:02,400
that for the meetup. Not one person got lost. Everybody was

1092
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,240
on time. Everybody was friendly. They brought stories

1093
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:09,120
they brought, you know, I was just like, does any other

1094
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,480
podcast network have such an amazing audience? I don't know.

1095
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,280
But ours is pretty great. I don't think so. How could they

1096
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,200
because we took all the good ones.

1097
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:22,480
True. I also learned so much just by chatting with people.

1098
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,720
Alex, I know you were fascinated, but basically all

1099
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,400
night because I was kind of hanging around you and learning

1100
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,400
a bunch of stuff. But Chris, you were having a great time. And it

1101
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,760
was almost like 10pm.

1102
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,440
Yeah, oh, we went for our meetup went for five hours

1103
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,200
strong, and I still didn't get to everybody. But let's, let's

1104
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,360
be clear here, Alex saved the night. Because our guest of the

1105
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:47,800
night, Tim can from JPL brought a very exclusive little device,

1106
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,760
he brought the computer from the Mars Copter, like that, you

1107
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,320
know, the earth version, the test version, the prototype

1108
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,880
version, he brought that for show and tell. So we can all see

1109
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,720
like just the parts that we don't recognize. And so you

1110
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,320
know, it's in this bag, and it's like secret top, or it's like

1111
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,440
private property of NASA and JPL, like it's, and then it's

1112
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:10,240
inside like this sealed case even, you know, and it was like

1113
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,920
really a big deal. And Tim bless his heart. You know, I think

1114
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,280
with everything going on, he got up, walked away, left it on the

1115
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,920
bench. He left it on the bench.

1116
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,520
We very nearly had our own iPhone four moment, didn't we?

1117
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:28,040
Very nearly. Yeah, you tapped him on the shoulder. And you're

1118
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,000
like, I think you forgot something. And I think he was

1119
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,720
extremely grateful. A little bit of history right there. Yeah.

1120
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,520
What a lovely guy. What a lovely guy. Yeah, it was really nice of

1121
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:42,800
him to help us make all that happen. And then to make it to

1122
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,680
the meetup as well and bring a little show and tell for

1123
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,840
everybody. Just so cool. Really, really a great experience

1124
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:50,600
something you'll never forget, you know? Yeah.

1125
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,280
Huge thanks to Tim. Huge thanks to everybody at JB. But of

1126
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,080
course, thanks to Linode as well for enabling us all to go down

1127
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:58,760
there and take the tour, you know?

1128
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,320
Yeah, absolutely. They, they really came through for us. And

1129
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,280

1132
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:15,280
there and all that and brighter, bolder colors. So awesome. You

1134
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,160

Yep. And if you missed us future meetups, meetup.com slash

1144

Jupiter broadcasting. Well, I do think we've we've done the

1145
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,160
meetups pretty heavily for the last few months. I will say if

1146
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,520
you're going to be in Raleigh around Halloween at all things

1147
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:59,440
open. I'm going to be in town obviously because I live here.

1148
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:02,640
But so is cheese bacon longtime friend of the network. I think

1149
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,480
system 76 are sending him over to man a booth for the

1150
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:11,560
conference. So we may do an informal meetup. Keep an eye on

1151
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:15,400
the matrix rally room. And we'll talk about any stuff that's

1152
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,320
going to happen in there. I mentioned in the shows too, of

1153
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,200
course, but the details will be in the matrix room.

1154
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,520
That's gonna be fun. All things open always seems like a good

1155
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,520
