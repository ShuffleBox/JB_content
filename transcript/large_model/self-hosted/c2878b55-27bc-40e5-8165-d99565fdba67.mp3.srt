00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,220
We're doing the show from Cheyenne Wyoming and Brent is here in Lady Dupes with me Alex. Hello Brent

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,080
Hello guys, I brought him with you know, he's been with us the whole trip Alex. We're in for such a treat tonight

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,520
I have two of my best friends in the whole world

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,960
My one of my favorite beverages and a self-hosted podcast. This is this is gonna be a perfect episode

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,120
Wow, wait a minute though. What's the favorite beverage? I feel like you gotta gotta give us more information

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,520
Well, this particular one is non-alcoholic

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,880
It's an import. Okay, so I've gone to a lot a lot of effort for this particular beverage

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,920
Import from Canada or somewhere further the British people in the audience are gonna laugh their faces off in a minute

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,260
It's it's Robinson's squash

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,880
You know what that is? No, I gotta look it up. Tell me about it. Okay, so it's just flavored water

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,880
Essentially, it's a bit of it's a bit of sugar

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,000
with

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,840
Apple and blackcurrant flavoring in it and every six months or so

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,520
Someone in my family sends me a care package with a few British treats in so some you know

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,720
British style Kit Kats because the Kit Kats you have over here a garbage. Mm-hmm. And then also a few of these Robinson's squashed

16
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,160
The this the word squash with an apostrophe and D after the end these little you know

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,640
Water flavoring packets you can get and I end up with a you know, the taste of home

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,400
It's it's just a little treat. I have every now and again that does sound kind of nice

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,560
We have we have we have some some things just like that on board today

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,600
Actually, the kids love to drink it while we're going down the road. We've been off grid and to killing it

21
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,440
In fact in some ways, I think I've been not in some ways in every single way. I've enjoyed our off-grid

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,560
Random spots that we've stayed along the way more than any of the campgrounds

23
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,040
Some have been forced and some have been planned, but they've all been good

24
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,400
you know there was there was a time where we had to pull over for a bit and

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,520
You know, the power system was great. Although we were a little we were a little short on water

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,160
The mobile internet system has been killing it though. It's been fantastic

27
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:05,160
We've had connectivity the entire time everywhere. We've went sometimes better or worse connectivity like here in Cheyenne, Wyoming. We have kind of

28
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,680
Moderate connectivity right now

29
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,080
but even with moderate connectivity you can still use a cloud guru and become a

30
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,360
A cloud guru go over to club guru comm the leader and learning for cloud and Linux and other modern tech skills hundreds of courses

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,600
Thousands of hands-on labs get certified get hired get learning at a cloud guru comm

32
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:34,320
So Alex with our special guest in studio as it were do you have any questions for our our exclusive?

33
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,480
Access to Brent. I mean, when's the last time we've had a chance to sit down and ask him a question

34
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,120
it's been too long for those of you that don't know Brent is the host of

35
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,520
Brunch with Brent which you can find over extras dot show

36
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,680
Now I wanted to ask you Brent you spent a few days now in lady dupes with Chris and the fam

37
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,440
He often goes on about

38
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,880
Accessibility of the home assistant interface and how he's got these

39
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,960
Tablets mounted to the wall and how easy it is to use and blah blah blah

40
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:07,100
I was curious as to how you found using someone else's automation system

41
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,160
Well, as you know, I don't have an automation system at home

42
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,840
So I'm pretty fresh when it comes to experiencing these things

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,400
However, I will say my experience on day one started actually in the studio

44
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:26,200
He very kindly set up the exact same tablet system in the studio as he did here in lady dupes

45
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,920
So night one I slept over there and had to figure it out. He gave me a 37 second tour

46
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,440
But actually that was enough. It had a familiar enough

47
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,760
On off switch interface with very kind labels that were identical to the voice commands

48
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,360
and so I was able to play a little bit actually I could sort of

49
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,520
Run over there and go see the tablet and what things were named and then use some of the voice commands

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,360
And I guess learn myself

51
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,080
The other thing I did is I got one of those wall mount socket mounts for the HomePod mini

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,600
So it's plugged in and mounted right there at the wall socket. And so it's in that guest room

53
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,800
So once you learn the names, you can just ask the HomePod to turn things on and off

54
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,080
I do remember when my mother-in-law came to stay once a couple of years ago now

55
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,080
I was just in the throes of doing home assistant, you know, the first few months

56
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:27,840
Everything I could possibly put behind automation was behind automation including, you know, the light switches the light switches no longer worked and

57
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:35,320
I just remember hearing through the wall. Hey Google turn off the sodding lights. Yeah

58
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,640
Yeah, you got it the memorizing the names is the hardest part I mean

59
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,080
My wife's been using the automation system for a couple of years now

60
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,640
She still has some troubles with the verbal syntax and in part that's because I've tried all the different

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,880
Assistant tubes and so they sometimes have various different syntaxes, but the real systems in the RV

62
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,240
That's like the bigger system. Mm-hmm. I feel like that system in the studio was really the training. It was like

63
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,440
step one

64
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,160
To the system in the RV. And so what was nice about that was that getting here into the RV?

65
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,240
It was like, oh, yeah, you know this tablet thing

66
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,160
It just has a heck of a lot more on the screen, but the same kind of systems apply

67
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,160
and so what I appreciate I think the most about that interface is its simplicity and

68
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,480
It's categorization. So Chris has the systems categorized by either living space or

69
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,200
what their use is and

70
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,080
So the first few nights I would walk all the way back there just to turn the lights on but these days

71
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,800
Feels a lot easier now, you know the names and they can just bark it into the air

72
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:50,080
Are you tempted at all to retrofit the cabin that you live in with with any of this stuff?

73
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,960
That's a very good question. So that hadn't quite hit me yet

74
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,600
But now I'm beginning to realize all of the advantages

75
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,880
So for instance Chris has shown me, you know, he gave me the geek tour and he's given other people the geek tour

76
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,360
So I've been on it a few times and there are sensors in various bays on the RV

77
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,000
That give temperature and in my home

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,280
I'm got these thermometers all over the place

79
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,600
But I got to actually, you know go up the stairs into my loft to go check out if the fire is too hot up

80
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
There and like an animal

81
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,840
So, yeah, I know I could see now

82
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,400
The two systems in juxtaposition where I could really gain some

83
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,560
Some currency there because we've talked a lot about how you in particular

84
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,640
can dip your toes into more self-hosting stuff and I feel like you're

85
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:48,640
Curious and you want to do this stuff, but you just don't quite know how to break down that first barrier and kind of

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,480
Get going. I think if I had to pick the very first barrier that's keeping me from it the most it would be the server side

87
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,680
It would be getting in there and creating a server that's stable enough and safe enough that I feel like

88
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,160
I'm not getting myself in more trouble than not. Mm-hmm

89
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,840
This is where I think the home assistant blue or something like it eventually is gonna be it's such an easy

90
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,920
on-ramp for a guy like you because you know about home assistant now you've you've seen my home assistant setup and

91
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,880
The fact that there is a an official home assistant device that runs the whole stack

92
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,720
That's that's pretty compelling

93
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,880
I don't know if the price points right yet or you know if it's quite the right device yet

94
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,440
But I could definitely see that being a good starting spot though, you know

95
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,320
I think that maybe you guys are on to something I have

96
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:44,360
At least two very good mentors who can walk me through some of the glitches if any but it sounds also like these days

97
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,400
You know, I've been hearing you guys talk about this for years, but it sounds like these days things are pretty solid

98
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,440
So I feel like for me, maybe then that was a nice time to jump in

99
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,000
Yeah, and you could always start small

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,360
Um, you'd be surprised to how many things homo system might just pick up on a LAN automatically and suggest integrations for and it's never

101
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,600
Been a better time to take local stuff. Seriously

102
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:04,800
I mean

103
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:11,360
I don't know if you saw the Apple news that broke over the last week or two about their expanded protections for children

104
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,240
In other words, they're going to scan all of your pictures for kiddie porn, right?

105
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,480
and it always starts this way and I I really hate this kind of

106
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,100
Insidious way that big companies will roll out

107
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:32,020
Overreaching egregious things like this in the name of you know, child porn because who could possibly disagree with child porn

108
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,900
The other thing about those integrations. It feels to me like it is

109
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:44,100
Affecting many people to solve the problems of few. Absolutely. No wonder about that

110
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:51,100
Yeah, I mean so as Apple put it our goal is to create technology that empowers people and enriches their lives

111
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:59,100
We want to help protect children from predators and those who use communication tools to recruit and exploit them and limit the spread of

112
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,100
CSAM, you know child sexual abuse material

113
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:08,100
Obviously, that's a laudable goal and we can't legitimately sit here and say that that is not a laudable goal

114
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,100
However, the way in which they're doing it. I have significant issues with so

115
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:23,100
What they're doing is they're taking every photo that you have on your iPhone or iPad that is linked to an iCloud account and

116
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Scanning it on your local device and this entire announcement has been extremely complicated and confusing because they've really announced three things

117
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:40,100
They've announced iMessage image detection for child accounts in a family plan. They've announced iCloud

118
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Photo library scanning on your local device

119
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,100
In other words, if you have iCloud photo library turned on locally on your device

120
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:56,100
It will scan and check for matches in the CSAM database. And then the third thing they've announced is they're also going to start censoring

121
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Results in Siri search. So if you search for something like child porn and it matches that stuff series going to block that and this is all happening

122
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:11,100
Using that new neural processing area in the Apple processors that they love to break so much

123
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:16,100
It's accelerating this and I find this to be an extremely extremely slippery slope

124
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,100
And I know that the other side of the argument is is that child harm is real

125
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:29,100
So one interesting stat you've probably seen this floating around is Apple reports a couple of hundred incidents of child porn and iMessage a year

126
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:38,100
A couple hundred a year and Facebook Messenger because they are already using the CSAM scanner reports 20 million

127
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:45,100
It's a huge difference and you've got to figure people that are using Facebook are probably on iPhones or Android devices

128
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:52,100
So there's probably a lot of iPhone users if 20 million Facebook messaging flags have happened

129
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Whatever that is whatever that metric is there's a good chance that they were using iPhones and that that stuff's on their phone

130
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,100
Now the thing is is it's not going to matter if they don't turn on iPhoto library

131
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:10,100
And if you are a big child porn collector I wouldn't imagine you're probably using iCloud's photo library feature

132
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,100
You probably wouldn't be auto uploading your child porn to their server right

133
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,100
I think you might be surprised actually I bet you there's a lot of people out there

134
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:24,100
Using technology just with for the bare minimum just to get what they need done and not understanding like we do the underlying principles

135
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:30,100
And yeah I guess and I suppose it's so easy to turn that stuff on you turn on iCloud when you get your phone

136
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:35,100
You don't realize every picture you're taking I suppose especially if you're taking the pictures with the phone

137
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:42,100
But an important thing to realize is the CSAM detection is only looking for images that are in the database

138
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:50,100
It's not doing like some sort of flesh recognition algorithm and detecting 80 percent nakedness on a 10 year old like it's not doing that

139
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:58,100
It is looking at a hash that has been provided by CSAM which they then only look for those images

140
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:04,100
And so it doesn't really feel that effective if you combine the fact that people can just turn off iCloud photo library

141
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,100
And it's only looking for the CSAM photos that exist today

142
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:16,100
It seems like a limited reach, limited return for a massive increase in surveillance on people's devices

143
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,100
And Alex I think it sounds like it bothers you that it's actually happening on device

144
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,100
Like you'd almost be more comfortable if it was happening up in the cloud it sounds like

145
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:33,100
I think I would and for me this feels like a capitulation to wider pressures that are at play

146
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:41,100
If you're Apple you probably get a lot of requests from different governments, different organizations

147
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,100
To put back doors into your end-to-end encryption algorithms

148
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,100
And for me I think this is their way of saying no we're not going to do that

149
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:57,100
But what we are going to do is say we have some protections in place for the stuff that you say is actually bad

150
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,100
As opposed to terrorists or whatever the next excuse is going to be

151
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Right, you say you need a backdoor for child porn so we are going to build a system that automatically detects it

152
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,100
And then your excuse for a backdoor goes away, it's nullified

153
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,100
And then you have to move on to the next one

154
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,100
But what bothers me most is there was an ad campaign not that long ago that says

155
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:24,100
What happens on your iPhone stays on your phone as part of their privacy message

156
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,100
This feels to me like it crosses a line because the scanning is happening on the local device

157
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:37,100
I don't necessarily opt in quite as obviously as I would if say my stuff was being uploaded to a remote server

158
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:44,100
Like Facebook is a good example, if I upload something to Facebook in my mind I consider that now public domain

159
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,100
Whatever the privacy controls that Facebook say is there

160
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,100
And it was an implicit action as well, you're choosing to upload to Facebook

161
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,100
It's a manual action you're taking where iCloud photo library is kind of a built-in default

162
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,100
You have to be an iCloud user and you can go in there and turn it on and off

163
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:07,100
But if you sign up for the whole shebang you're going to get iCloud photo and every photo you take goes in there

164
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,100
Like you said it's just a very, very slippery slope

165
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,100
This year it's child pornography, next year it's terrorists

166
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:22,100
In 20 years time it's monitoring a social credit score because you said something bad about the president

167
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,100
That's what I worry about

168
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,100
It's also true that these are only the things that they're saying they're scanning for

169
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,100
We don't know about the things they are not saying

170
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:36,100
Right and if you go by the docs that Apple has released they don't even have input in that CSAM database

171
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:41,100
They're basically just being handed a list of hashes, here put this in your database

172
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Now I have to say I am actually more comfortable with this being on device

173
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,100
I think because it limits the scale and scope of something when it's on device

174
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,100
A big database update or a feature like this is going to have to come through a software update

175
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,100
Where if it was a cloud service they would just push the update and one day I would be subject to it

176
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:04,100
So I kind of prefer those aspects and I think it also does help with the privacy aspect

177
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,100
They're not having to unencrypt everything on iCloud to do this

178
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,100
They're doing it on your device that already has access

179
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,100
And then they're pinging Apple with a hey we think we found a match here

180
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,100
Apple then has to have some sort of human interact with that alert

181
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,100
There's various descriptions of what kind of alert they get

182
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
And then Apple flags the authorities

183
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,100
And it does seem like they've taken a lot of steps here

184
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,100
They've limited the way they check this, they're looking for specific fingerprints

185
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,100
And then they have this cryptographic signature that they assign to it when they think they have found one

186
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,100
And that's what they send up to Apple

187
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,100
Then it's reviewed by a human

188
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
It's happening on your device instead of at cloud

189
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,100
And you can turn it off by turning off iCloud photo library

190
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:49,100
Is this a reasonable compromise if the platform, let's just say for the sake of argument

191
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:55,100
Is really being used for child abuse at some massive scale because of the popularity of the platform

192
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Is this a reasonable thing for them to do?

193
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:02,100
Do they have some responsibility as a platform owner with a billion devices out there

194
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,100
To take some action to try to maybe stop something like this?

195
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,100
Well I look at that 20 million figure that you came out with for Facebook

196
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,100
And divide that by 365 and that's 55,000 flags a day

197
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Who is reviewing 55,000 flags a day?

198
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,100
That's just a crazy amount of signal to noise ratio isn't it?

199
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,100
No kidding

200
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,100
Well and can you imagine when they turn this on

201
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:31,100
The initial, if this is going to be a thing and it's a real big problem

202
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,100
You would think they're going to have just this massive deluge of alerts

203
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
And I just wouldn't want that job

204
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:44,100
Well I've certainly been on the other end of logging overload or alert overload

205
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
You just stop looking after a while

206
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,100
And you know the other reality is several cloud providers

207
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,100
I think many, I don't want to name them off the top of my head

208
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,100
But I know Facebook and Microsoft are already doing this scanning

209
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,100
They're already doing this

210
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,100
Apple was one of sort of the holdouts here

211
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,100
So it really comes back to if you're not comfortable with this

212
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,100
You really have to self host

213
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,100
And you have to advocate self hosting

214
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,100
Because that's the only way you can avoid this kind of content scanning

215
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,100
And if you're worried about the slippery slope of what could be added to this database

216
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:18,100
Then I think people should really be, I don't know like

217
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,100
When you can, self host

218
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,100
Like invest in self hosting, use it, make an audience for it out there

219
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Absolutely and on that note actually

220
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,100
I thought we might try doing a new challenge in the show

221
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,100
The de-Googlification challenge

222
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,100
I need to come up with a better name than that, don't I?

223
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
I don't know, I actually kind of like it

224
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,100
Because I know what you mean immediately

225
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,100
Yeah, so the idea is

226
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,100
I'm not going to be able to just cold turkey drop Google from my life

227
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,100
Because I use Gmail and I have done for 15 years or however long

228
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,100
I've been using it a long time, since the beta anyway

229
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,100
I use Google Photos a lot

230
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,100
I use Google, you know, it's going to be tricky

231
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,100
I'm not going to pull any punches

232
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
It's going to be very difficult

233
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,100
But the idea is, one day a week

234
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,100
I am going to go completely cold turkey from Google

235
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,100
That's DuckDuckGo

236
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
That's a self hosted note service

237
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,100
A self hosted photo service completely

238
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,100
No Google photo backup etc etc

239
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
No Gmail

240
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,100
And no Android

241
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,100
Well, technically I'm going to be using LineageOS

242
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,100
And I think the only thing that I will allow in terms of de-Googlifying

243
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:34,100
Is the micro Gapps thing through

244
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,100
So for the very first iteration of this

245
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,100
It will probably be in episode 53

246
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,100
This is 51, just because I'm going to Denver next week

247
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,100
To see you two fine gentlemen

248
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:49,100
And I probably won't have time to do the full research on this

249
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,100
But I have an old OnePlus 6 in a drawer

250
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:57,100
I'm going to designate that as my de-Googlify device

251
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,100
What do you think?

252
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,100
I mean, I love this idea

253
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,100
I have an Android device, it's a Pixel 3

254
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:07,100
But I've always struggled with replacing the ROM on there

255
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Because the reason I have it

256
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,100
Is to kind of know what the Google experience is like

257
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
But I'd be down for it

258
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,100
I'd give it a try

259
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,100
I'm trying to run through my head

260
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,100
My biggest area where I worry this is going to lead to

261
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,100
Is I use Google Apps for Jupiter broadcasting

262
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,100
For like email and calendar and stuff like that

263
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,100
And I think it's kind of a decent service

264
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
I hate to say it

265
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,100
Oh right, calendar

266
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,100
I'd forgotten about calendar, I use that all the time

267
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,100
Even stupid stuff like contacts

268
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,100
You kind of forget that they're just managing my contacts for me on that

269
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,100
Oh gentlemen, you guys are so behind the times

270
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,100
Oh, oh what?

271
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,100
You all in our next cloud over there?

272
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,100
Well, I ran through this very experiment many years ago

273
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,100
I'll have you know

274
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Could you sound any more smug right now?

275
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,100
Well, it's only because you guys are both

276
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Typically far ahead of me in most other realms

277
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,100
He's enjoying this moment too much Alex

278
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,100
He's enjoying this

279
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,100
Well good, I want to hear it

280
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,100
I did a similar challenge

281
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,100
I didn't have anyone else to challenge

282
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,100
I just challenged myself

283
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,100
And I will say it's been actually a few years now

284
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,100
I think two, two and a half, something like that

285
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,100
And next cloud I will say is the underpinning of most of it

286
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:29,100
Most of the hard stuff which was calendaring and contact syncing

287
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,100
You know when it comes to file syncing

288
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,100
I can figure that out in a whole bunch of different ways

289
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,100
But I will strongly encourage you both to take it pretty seriously

290
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,100
Because on the other side is a fairly liberating feeling

291
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:48,100
To know that you have control of all of your own deeply personal information

292
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
I mean something like contacts

293
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,100
If you think about the people you know

294
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
And the sensitive information that's in there

295
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,100
It's a little bit surprising to think about what might happen

296
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,100
If that got into someone else's hands

297
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,100
That would like to mix up your life a little bit

298
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,100
Well you heard it here first ladies and gentlemen

299
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,100
Brent is our de-Googlification referee

300
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,100
Yeah, he'll be our correspondent in the de-Googled universe

301
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,100
Reporting live from an alternative universe

302
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,100
So the thing is, I mean there's so many things to this

303
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,100
There's maps, Google Maps is so priceless

304
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,100
Maps? Oh no

305
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,100
I know

306
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
And you could, like if you're on the iPhone

307
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,100
You could use Apple Maps, you could

308
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
And in the RV I've got a Garmin

309
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,100
But I tell you what, when I get to a new town

310
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,100
And like legitimately has happened several times on this road trip

311
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,100
I trust Google Maps to have the most up to date information

312
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,100
That's going to be really hard for me to kick

313
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,100
I really haven't thought this through, this is going to be so hard

314
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,100
Well I can give you a few pointers based on what I've gone through

315
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,100
Are you not using Google Maps?

316
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,100
Well, so that's a really good example of I think the concept I'm about to explain

317
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:07,100
And so I'll start with saying that I use the exact same concept with my dietary choices

318
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,100
So when people say, oh how do you eat Brent?

319
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:17,100
I say well, I'm like trying my very best to eat as vegan as possible

320
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,100
But that never always works out

321
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,100
So what I would say for you both in de-Googlifying

322
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,100
Is you'll never likely get to 100%

323
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,100
And you need to be okay with that

324
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,100
Because if you can do it even 80, 90, 95% of the time

325
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,100
And only rely on Google in certain instances

326
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:45,100
Maybe when Maps in Google has the only updated information on this new ring road around your city

327
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,100
And nobody else does or something like that

328
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,100
Then I think you're already making a massive difference in your life

329
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,100
And you shouldn't feel bad about that 5% or whatever it may be

330
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,100
Amen, yeah absolutely

331
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,100
So the idea behind this challenge is to do exactly what we've just done

332
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,100
Pick a service, in this case it was Google as a whole

333
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,100
But let's take Maps as an example

334
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,100
Discuss what would be required to drop that service

335
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,100
Figure out in the intervening two weeks

336
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:15,100
Some options we could use to try and replace it with

337
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,100
And then in the following episode repeat that cycle

338
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,100
Pick a new service and report back on how the old one went

339
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,100
I mean I kind of feel like if I was going to do it

340
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,100
I could try Maps while I'm on the road

341
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:31,100
Like this is an opportunity to try alternative mapping and routing

342
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,100
I know there's a few apps I could give a go

343
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,100
Maybe I'll try, this is going to be crazy, but while I'm on the road trip

344
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,100
I'll try for the next two weeks not to use Google Maps

345
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,100
See how that goes

346
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,100
Go for it, yeah

347
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,100
I have a question about your choices of alternatives

348
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,100
Will you try to make them free and open source

349
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,100
Or just try to be an equivalent replacement?

350
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,100
What's the name of the show, Brent?

351
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,100
I'm thinking like for mapping, I don't know what would be even equivalent

352
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,100
I think it's not so much equivalent, it's about just core functionality

353
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,100
There's always MapQuest

354
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,100
Yeah, and I feel like switching to Google Search to look things up

355
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Isn't an alternative that I can accept either

356
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
So I'll have to give it some thought

357
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,100
I will have to give it some thought

358
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,100
I'm going to look into a couple of different apps for it

359
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,100
And I'm also going to look into how Apple Maps works

360
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,100
And see what the privacy situation is there

361
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,100
Because that's also already on my device

362
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,100
That's a factor too

363
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
It's like you're saying, I love your point about

364
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,100
You could just reduce your footprint at Google

365
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,100
If that's the goal, I think that's something I could get behind

366
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,100
But it doesn't necessarily mean I want to increase my footprint somewhere else

367
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,100
So that's the math I'm going to have to do

368
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,100
I don't mind taking two steps forward and one step back

369
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,100
With this over the next few years

370
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:41,100
Because that's how long I genuinely think it will take

371
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,100
I just worry, you know, you see people like Apple

372
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:50,100
Who were genuinely supposed to be the privacy first people

373
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,100
Rolling out stuff like this CSAM protections

374
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,100
And you just think, yeah, it's never going to get any better

375
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,100
It's up to me to take control

376
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,100
It's up to me to host this stuff

377
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,100
And if I take my daughter, for example

378
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,100
I think there's one photograph of her on Facebook

379
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,100
One in the last six months

380
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,100
And I want to keep it as low as that

381
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
One every six months

382
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:16,100
I mean, why does Facebook need all of that data to mine on her?

383
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,100
So it's not her choice

384
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,100
She can't make that choice yet

385
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,100
Because she's six months old, you know

386
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,100
When she's old enough to make that choice for herself

387
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,100
And understand the implications

388
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,100
Then fair enough

389
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,100
But it's not really my place to share her pictures everywhere, is it?

390
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,100
Linode.com slash SSH

391
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,100
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account

392
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,100
And you go there to support this here podcast

393
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,100
You know, this show is made possible

394
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,100
Independent content like this

395
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,100
By our listeners taking advantage of our sponsors' offer

396
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,100
And Linode is one that we can enthusiastically endorse

397
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,100
We use it, we love it

398
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,100
It is powering our live tracker right now

399
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,100
As we go down the road

400
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,100
Linode started in 2003

401
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,100
As one of the very first companies in cloud computing

402
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,100
You know, that was 18 years ago

403
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,100
That's like a whole other internet

404
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,100
And the entire time they've stayed competitive

405
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,100
They've increased the capabilities

406
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,100
The performance

407
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,100
The smooth slickness of the dashboard

408
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,100
Over time, they became their own ISP

409
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,100
They've built out to 11 data centers around the world

410
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,100
Super crazy fast systems

411
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,100
They're always investing in the disk I.O.

412
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,100
In the CPUs

413
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,100
In the network connections

414
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,100
And now, they've got nearly a million customers

415
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,100
And businesses around the globe

416
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,100
But yet, Linode's core focus remains

417
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,100
They're making cloud computing simple

418
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,100
Affordable

419
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,100
And really accessible to all of us

420
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,100
If you're a sys admin that's been doing this for years

421
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,100
Or if you've never set up a server

422
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,100
You can get started at Linode

423
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,100
And I think that focus has really led to the best-in-class

424
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
Dashboard

425
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
Speed

426
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,100
And more importantly, customer service

427
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
When you do need it

428
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,100
They've got the very best in the business

429
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,100
And then, as you start to use Linode

430
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
Or something you could use that $100 credit to check out

431
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
Is some of their nice features

432
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,100
Like the S3-compatible object storage

433
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,100
Think about all of the software

434
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,100
Like the backup software you have

435
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,100
Or different ways you can mount file systems

436
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,100
That support S3-compatible object storage

437
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,100
Start thinking about what you could do with that

438
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,100
Not even from like a server standpoint

439
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,100
But just like a cloud storage standpoint that you control

440
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,100
You encrypt

441
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
And then you upload

442
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,100
Plus, they have cloud firewalls

443
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,100
VLAN support

444
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,100
They support a very powerful DNS manager

445
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,100
Block storage as well

446
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,100
I know some of you still prefer the traditional disk

447
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,100
They've got that

448
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,100
And then they also support things like Terraform and Kubernetes

449
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,100
If that

450
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,100
Kubernetes

451
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,100
I say Kubernetes

452
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,100
If that's the direction you're going

453
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,100
They've got all of that

454
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,100
And you combine that with the fact that you can get $100

455
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,100
And support the self-hosted podcast

456
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,100
Well, what kind of maniac wouldn't go to linode.com

457
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,100
Slash SSH

458
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,100
Get that $100 60-day credit on your new account

459
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
And you support the show

460
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
And by the way

461
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,100
If you're coming to our Denver meetup next week

462
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,100
Linode will be there

463
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,100
They're going to be giving out prizes

464
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
Linode credit

465
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Raspberry pies

466
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,100
I mean, Linode is going all in on our road trip

467
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,100
And they're helping support it

468
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,100
It's great

469
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,100
And we'd love to see you at the meetup

470
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,100
That's linode.com slash SSH

471
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,100
To get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account

472
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,100
And to support the show

473
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,100
Linode.com slash SSH

474
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,100
I know you've got this whole road trip prep ritual

475
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,100
Where you update things a couple of nights before

476
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,100
In critical systems the week before

477
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,100
And all this kind of stuff

478
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
What did you upgrade this time?

479
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,100
You are correct

480
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:29,100
And yes, I did do some updates

481
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,100
This time, you know what I wanted to do

482
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,100
Is I wanted to try out the new Pi-hole

483
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,100
Because I was sniffing around

484
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,100
Pi-hole is one of these things

485
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,100
For those of you who maybe are not familiar

486
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,100
Pi-hole is

487
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,100
It's like a nice DNS manager that can block ads

488
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,100
Maybe block adult material

489
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,100
Has a lot of advantages

490
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,100
It's also a DHCP server

491
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,100
So it can hand out addressing

492
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,100
And then give your systems on your network names

493
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,100
And it gives you a beautiful dashboard

494
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,100
To see everything on there

495
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,100
It just checks all my boxes

496
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,100
And you can run it as a Docker container

497
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,100
Which is what I'm doing on a Raspberry Pi

498
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,100
And I have version 4 on there forever

499
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,100
Since I talked about it on the show

500
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,100
And it's just been running

501
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
I don't even mess with it

502
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,100
But I thought

503
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,100
You know what I want to do on this road trip

504
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
Because I'm an old man

505
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,100
And I go to bed, as Brent could attest

506
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,100
Really early

507
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,100
Quite

508
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,100
I've had to change my schedule

509
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,100
When do you normally go to bed?

510
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
Well, if left to my own devices

511
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,100
I drift deep into the night

512
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,100
But that doesn't serve most people around me

513
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,100
Yeah, we're doing like what?

514
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,100
9, 10 PM at the latest

515
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,100
And so I don't want the kids up much later than that

516
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,100
Browsing the internet

517
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,100
Because they can just get their devices

518
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,100
After dad nods off

519
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,100
And start browsing the web

520
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,100
Or watching YouTube more likely

521
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,100
Let's be honest

522
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
And so I wanted to be able to pause their devices

523
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,100
And I had read that you could do that in PyHole

524
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,100
But I logged into my PyHole setup

525
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,100
And I had just done a Docker poll

526
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,100
So it should be totally up to date

527
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,100
And I log in

528
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
And it's several versions behind

529
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,100
And I'm looking at my Docker compose file

530
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,100
And I see it's using the latest tag

531
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,100
You know, for the latest image

532
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,100
And I think

533
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,100
Okay, well, why aren't I getting that?

534
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,100
I'm starting to think

535
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,100
Maybe there's some compatibility problem

536
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,100
So I start looking into it

537
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,100
And it turns out

538
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,100
No, I'm using the wrong tag

539
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,100
I was supposed to be using PyHole Master

540
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,100
Arm64 Buster

541
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,100
Because I'm on a Buster-based Debian

542
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,100
And so I set the right tag in there

543
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,100
I get the right image

544
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,100
I pull down version 5

545
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,100
It's like version 5.3 or whatever

546
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,100
Working great

547
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,100
The upgrade goes super smooth

548
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,100
You know, congrats to the PyHole team

549
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,100
For making that easy

550
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,100
And yet I can't pause the devices

551
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,100
Like I read like I should be able to

552
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,100
I grouped up the kids' devices by Mac addresses

553
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,100
I go into their group

554
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,100
I say disable

555
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
And I think what I'm just doing is disabling

556
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,100
The PyHole filtering

557
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,100
I don't think I'm disabling their internet access

558
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,100
So I went through this whole rigamarole

559
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,100
Getting this whole system updated

560
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,100
So that way we'd have the latest PyHole

561
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,100
While we're going down the road

562
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,100
Because my theory is

563
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,100
Let's block the ads at the network level

564
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,100
So that way I'm not wasting network bandwidth

565
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,100
You know, because we have limited network bandwidth

566
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,100
Anything I can do

567
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
So PyHole, it's working great

568
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,100
But it's not giving me the results I wanted

569
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,100
I wanted to be able to pause the kids' internet

570
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,100
When I go to bed

571
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,100
And I cannot do it

572
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
If anybody out there knows a way

573
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,100
To do this with PyHole

574
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,100
Or a relatively straightforward way

575
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
To just accomplish this

576
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,100
That doesn't require a specific router software

577
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,100
Or whatever

578
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,100
I'd love to know

579
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
Selfhost.show.com

580
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,100
But the upshot is

581
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,100
Upgrading from PyHole 4 to PyHole 5.3.whatever

582
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,100
Super smooth

583
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,100
Totally flawless

584
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,100
Once I got the right tag in there

585
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,100
I have a question

586
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,100
Would you be able to tie that into your

587
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:35,100
Home Assistant Goodnight Kids recipe?

588
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,100
Oh, I could imagine

589
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,100
I do pull in Home Assistant

590
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,100
There is a PyHole integration

591
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,100
And so I do pull into Home Assistant

592
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,100
The amount of active network clients

593
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,100
And some DNS stats for the day

594
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,100
And I graph them in Home Assistant

595
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,100
On the dashboard

596
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,100
Just for my own fun

597
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,100
And I don't know

598
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,100
But I bet you

599
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,100
There is a way you could totally do that

600
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,100
When I run that script

601
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,100
It also would pause their devices

602
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,100
Right

603
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,100
Have a look in your Telegram

604
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,100
I've just sent you a picture

605
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,100
This is of the AdGuard home interface

606
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,100
And just look at all the different services

607
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,100
That you can toggle on and toggle off

608
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,100
And then also look at the top of this page

609
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,100
Where it says

610
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,100
Select the tags that correspond to a specific client

611
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,100
You know, the tag being child or whatever it is

612
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,100
Doesn't this do what you need?

613
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,100
Ah

614
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,100
Yeah, you know

615
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,100
The only thing that's

616
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,100
The funny thing about it is

617
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,100
It felt like

618
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,100
This approach with AdGuard

619
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,100
Because I actually gave AdGuard

620
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,100
About a 20 minute try

621
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,100
It didn't have like

622
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,100
Just turn off everything

623
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,100
You can go in and block individual services

624
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,100
Like eBay

625
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,100
Hulu

626
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,100
Discord

627
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,100
Amazon

628
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,100
Instagram

629
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,100
Facebook

630
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,100
Telegram

631
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,100
Twitch

632
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,100
YouTube

633
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,100
All which actually would basically do the job

634
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,100
To be honest with you

635
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,100
If I just turned off YouTube

636
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,100
That'd do 90% of it

637
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,100
But I just want

638
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
Turn off internet access

639
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,100
Like just

640
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,100
Don't route them

641
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,100
Could you send them to a dud DNS server?

642
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,100
I was wondering about that

643
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,100
You know, it would

644
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,100
It would have to be a pretty short DHCP lease

645
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,100
That somehow switched

646
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,100
Around bedtime

647
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,100
Or something like that

648
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,100
I don't know

649
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,100
Or maybe reboot the Wi-Fi access point

650
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,100
Then every client

651
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,100
Gets a new IP

652
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,100
And at that point

653
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,100
They all get routed to like

654
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,100
Nowhere

655
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,100
I mean, I think the AdGuard solution

656
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,100
May be just simpler

657
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,100
Because if you turn off

658
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,100
It's funny that Cloudflare

659
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,100
Is one of the services in here

660
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,100
I mean, if you turn off Cloudflare

661
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,100
You're going to break

662
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,100
A lot of the internet

663
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,100
Right there

664
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,100
And then if I turn off YouTube

665
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,100
That's going to do pretty much

666
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,100
The rest of it for them

667
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,100
Yeah

668
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,100
So maybe I'll go back to AdGuard

669
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,100
I think I liked the DHCP server

670
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,100
Setup better in PyHole

671
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,100
When I was looking at the two though

672
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,100
One option might just be

673
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,100
Throw them on a different

674
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,100
Wi-Fi network

675
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,100
And switch that off

676
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,100
Yeah, that's true

677
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,100
I could have a kid Wi-Fi network

678
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,100
That's the one, Brent

679
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,100
The simple solutions

680
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,100
Are always the best

681
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,100
Simplicity, gentlemen

682
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,100
I, you know

683
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,100
I do need another Wi-Fi network

684
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,100
In this thing

685
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,100
I've got like six or something

686
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,100
I don't know

687
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,100
It's ridiculous

688
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,100
But yeah, that would probably work

689
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Huh?

690
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,100
If you have a better idea

691
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,100
Let us know at

692
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,100
self-hosted.show slash contact

693
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,100
Now, in the meantime

694
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,100
OnePass would have been busy this week

695
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,100
And released version 8

696
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,100
Yeah, version 8 of what I used to think

697
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:15,100
Was one of the best password managers

698
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,100
Out there

699
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
And they recently released

700
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
A Linux desktop version

701
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,100
And they announced that the backend

702
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,100
Was written in Rust

703
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
And I thought, hey

704
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,100
Isn't that just fantastic?

705
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,100
But version 8 is switching

706
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,100
To a subscription-only service, Alex

707
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,100
And I think there's kind of

708
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,100
A big loss in functionality with that

709
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,100
Three dollars a month

710
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,100
To manage your passwords

711
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,100
Why do we need a password manager

712
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,100
To be a subscription service?

713
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,100
Not only that

714
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
Why do we need a password manager

715
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,100
That can no longer handle local vaults?

716
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:51,100
My mind is just blowing out right now

717
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,100
When I read this news this week

718
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,100
I just couldn't believe

719
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,100
They would make such a dumb move

720
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,100
And then I saw that they took

721
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,100
A $200 million Series A funding

722
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,100
Late in 2019

723
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
And suddenly, all became clear

724
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,100
Oh yeah, okay

725
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,100
That does kind of connect the dots

726
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,100
Doesn't it, unfortunately

727
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,100
I hate to see it that way

728
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,100
But that's...

729
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,100
That's pretty tough not to see

730
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,100
And then when you combine

731
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,100
The changes they're making

732
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,100
So that Linux Electron app

733
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,100
They created with the Rust backend

734
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,100
Surprise!

735
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,100
Turns out to be what they're

736
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,100
Switching everybody to

737
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,100
So now the new Mac version's

738
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
Also Electron

739
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,100
And the Mac users are pissed

740
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,100
Because 1Password started as

741
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,100
Kind of an exclusive to the

742
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,100
Apple ecosystem

743
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,100
With native applications

744
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,100
That was what 1Password

745
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,100
Was special for

746
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,100
And so now

747
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,100
They switch over to Electron

748
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,100
The Mac users are just pissed

749
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,100
And I don't mean to laugh

750
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,100
But Linux users

751
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,100
We've had to live with that

752
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,100
For a while already

753
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,100
But it's two whammies at once

754
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,100
An Electron Swaperoo

755
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:54,100
And the removal of a local vault

756
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,100
That's just...

757
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,100
That's just...

758
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,100
Well...

759
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,100
That's game over right there

760
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,100
I have 1Password installed

761
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,100
On my machine because

762
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,100
I was playing around with it

763
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,100
To compare it to Bitwarden

764
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,100
And they just disqualified themselves

765
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,100
I remember 1Password

766
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,100
I think was the first

767
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,100
Password manager I used

768
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,100
It must have been...

769
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,100
Because I was still working

770
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,100
At the Apple store at the time

771
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,100
So it was 2013

772
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,100
I want to say

773
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,100
And at the time I thought

774
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,100
It was absolutely crazy

775
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,100
The idea of putting

776
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,100
All my passwords in one place

777
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,100
I thought

778
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,100
How could that

779
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
How can this possibly be

780
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,100
More secure

781
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,100
Than me remembering

782
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,100
The password in my head

783
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,100
Yeah

784
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,100
I remember that

785
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,100
I think I thought that way too

786
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
Very early on

787
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,100
I was very skeptical

788
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,100
Yeah but over time

789
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,100
I mean my

790
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,100
Approaches matured

791
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,100
And everything now lives

792
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,100
In my Bitwarden

793
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,100
And I do mean everything

794
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,100
Wireguard configs live in there

795
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,100
Bit of a tangent for a second

796
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,100
We had a right old chat this week

797
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,100
About encrypted storage

798
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,100
Vaults on Discord

799
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,100
With a couple of the guys on there

800
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,100
One was talking about

801
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
CryptoMator

802
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,100
Which I'll talk about

803
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,100
In a future episode

804
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,100
And another one was talking about

805
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,100
VeraCrypt

806
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,100
And both of those are great fun

807
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,100
But honestly nothing beats

808
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,100
The simplicity of Bitwarden for me

809
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Just you can store files in there

810
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,100
You can do all your

811
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,100
Two factor stuff in there

812
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,100
And all your passwords

813
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,100
I mean if you know

814
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
My master password

815
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,100
I've never said it out loud

816
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,100
Good for you

817
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,100
Well done

818
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,100
I mean you deserve to crack

819
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,100
Some of my stuff I guess

820
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,100
Bitwarden should totally

821
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,100
Sponsor this show

822
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,100
Because I am a big

823
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,100
Bitwarden fan now too

824
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,100
They totally won out

825
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,100
In my test

826
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,100
And the fact that there's that

827
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,100
Rust implementation of the server

828
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,100
That's super easy to get up

829
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,100
And running

830
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,100
I'm just all about it

831
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,100
Have you tried Bitwarden?

832
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,100
You know I will admit

833
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,100
I haven't

834
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,100
I got onto password managers

835
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,100
Even earlier than Alex

836
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,100
I will admit

837
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,100
And

838
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
Wow he's really taking

839
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,100
This opportunity Alex

840
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,100
You don't have me on the show

841
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,100
That often

842
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,100
So I got to take it all

843
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,100
I love it

844
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:49,100
So I landed on

845
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,100
A great many years ago

846
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,100
On the key pass databases

847
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,100
And I will say that

848
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,100
They are simpler

849
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,100
And I have to sync them myself

850
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,100
With some other solution

851
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,100
However they've been solid

852
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,100
And my father thinks they're

853
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,100
His favorite application ever

854
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,100
And that says something

855
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,100
So everyone I've shown it to

856
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,100
Has enjoyed their simplicity

857
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,100
And hasn't needed to think about it

858
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,100
Much more than that

859
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,100
So I think Bitwarden

860
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,100
If I was getting into it today

861
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
Would be the perfect solution for me

862
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,100
But I don't really have

863
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,100
A reason to change

864
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,100
Keypass and keypass

865
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,100
Was it XC?

866
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,100
I think

867
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,100
Very popular options

868
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,100
But you touched on the reason

869
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,100
Why I won't consider it

870
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,100
And that for me is the fact

871
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,100
That you have to sync it

872
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,100
With Voltwarden

873
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,100
Which is a self hosted

874
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
Bitwarden server

875
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,100
And the hosted service

876
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,100
That costs $12 a year

877
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,100
I never have to think about it

878
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,100
And for passwords

879
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,100
When I have way too many devices

880
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,100
In my life

881
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,100
And I have often

882
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,100
Got more than one phone

883
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,100
And a tablet

884
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,100
And a laptop

885
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,100
And a desktop

886
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,100
And a server

887
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
And wife's phone

888
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,100
And blah blah blah

889
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,100
I just don't need that extra

890
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,100
Complexity in my life

891
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,100
Systemd has been around

892
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,100
For a while

893
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,100
And a lot of us

894
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,100
Can muddle through

895
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,100
But our friends at a cloud guru

896
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,100
Have a course

897
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,100
In systemd management

898
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,100
For Linux

899
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,100
That will take it

900
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,100
To the next level for you

901
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,100
You can get an idea

902
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,100
Of how the components

903
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,100
Work together

904
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,100
How to configure

905
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,100
This rather important

906
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
Piece of system software

907
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,100
It's a course that's designed

908
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,100
To help demystify

909
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,100
The sometimes difficult

910
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,100
And deep topic

911
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Of systemd

912
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,100
So go over to

913
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,100
Acloudguru.com for that

914
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,100
Or we will have a link

915
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,100
In the show notes

916
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,100
For systemd management

917
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,100
For Linux

918
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,100
At acloudguru.com

919
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,100
And you're all familiar

920
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,100
With cloudfree.shop

921
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,100
At this point

922
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,100
You can go over there

923
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,100
And use the coupon code

924
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,100
Self hosted

925
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,100
To get $1 off a smart plug

926
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,100
The version 2 smart plugs

927
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,100
From cloudfree

928
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,100
Have just launched

929
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,100
With built in energy monitoring

930
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,100
But some good news

931
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,100
For the British people

932
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,100
In the audience

933
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,100
One of our other listeners

934
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,100
On the other side of the pond

935
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,100
Has launched

936
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,100
A similar store

937
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,100
In England

938
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,100
This is at

939
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
Mylocalbytes.com

940
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,100
And to start with

941
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,100
He has launched

942
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,100
A couple of Zigbee devices

943
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,100
As well as a

944
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,100
Branded smart plug

945
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,100
For Localbytes

946
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,100
Again you can use

947
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,100
The coupon code

948
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,100
Self hosted

949
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,100
To get a pound off that

950
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,100
But if

951
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,100
For all of those of you

952
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,100
That have been asking me

953
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,100
About cloudfree.shop

954
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,100
Shipping to

955
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,100
The UK

956
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,100
Well here's your answer

957
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,100
At mylocalbytes.com

958
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,100
Wow that's so great

959
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,100
Now we have no affiliation

960
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,100
With them other than

961
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,100
They are listeners

962
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,100
But this is incredible

963
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,100
They even have an LED

964
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,100
Light strip thing there

965
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,100
What a cool idea

966
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,100
What a cool idea

967
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,100
Mylocalbytes.com

968
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,100
And I love that

969
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,100
There's some Zigbee tech

970
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,100
In there

971
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,100
I've been thinking

972
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,100
More and more

973
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,100
I think I'm going to

974
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,100
Quit getting wifi devices

975
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,100
I'm going to go

976
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,100
Z-Wave and Zigbee

977
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,100
On stuff

978
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,100
We got an email

979
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,100
In about

980
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,100
Two weeks ago

981
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,100
We got an email

982
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,100
In about

983
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,100
My usage

984
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,100
Of wall panel

985
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,100
The linux trucker writes

986
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,100
I was listening to

987
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,100
Your last episode

988
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,100
And heard you talking

989
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,100
About wall panel

990
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,100
Although it is

991
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,100
Great software

992
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,100
I feel there is

993
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,100
A better option

994
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,100
The fully kiosk browser

995
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,100
Does everything

996
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,100
That wall panel does

997
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,100
Including motion detection

998
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,100
Auto launch

999
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,100
And will even function

1000
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,100
With the home button

1001
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,100
On android

1002
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,100
However

1003
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,100
For use with home assistant

1004
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,100
It takes it

1005
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,100
A step further

1006
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,100
Fully kiosk

1007
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,100
Will connect to

1008
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,100
MQTT

1009
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,100
And send battery

1010
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,100
Temperature and some of

1011
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,100
The other information

1012
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,100
To the home assistant

1013
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,100
I'm using this

1014
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,100
In combination with

1015
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,100
A smart outlet

1016
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,100
To cycle the battery

1017
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,100
In hopes it will

1018
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,100
Last a little bit longer

1019
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,100
Man, I've been talking

1020
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,100
About doing that

1021
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,100
That's awesome

1022
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,100
Linux trucker goes on

1023
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,100
To say

1024
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,100
It also gives you

1025
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,100
One more device

1026
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,100
You can use

1027
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,100
For automations

1028
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,100
And tinkering

1029
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,100
In home assistant

1030
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,100
This is a very small

1031
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,100
Five dollar fee

1032
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,100
To unlock all

1033
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,100
Of the features

1034
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,100
And I don't mind

1035
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,100
Supporting great software

1036
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,100
That I use every day

1037
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,100
Give it a look

1038
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,100
Before you settle

1039
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,100
For wall panel

1040
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,100
The linux trucker

1041
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,100
Is saying

1042
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,100
Hi Chris and Alex

1043
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,100
I recently bought

1044
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,100
My first apartment

1045
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,100
And construction

1046
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,100
Will take about

1047
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,100
Two years

1048
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,100
My wife is going to

1049
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,100
Focus on the kitchen

1050
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,100
The living room

1051
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,100
And the bathroom

1052
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,100
Whilst what I'm thinking about

1053
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,100
Are the tech parts

1054
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,100
Of the project

1055
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,100
Of course

1056
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,100
I have many things

1057
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,100
I'm wondering about

1058
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,100
And I'm not entirely sure

1059
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,100
What to prioritize

1060
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,100
I mean

1061
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,100
Laying cables

1062
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,100
And other electrical work

1063
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,100
Is probably going to be

1064
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,100
One of the more important things

1065
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,100
But I'm already wondering

1066
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,100
For example

1067
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,100
Whether POE

1068
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,100
Is the right tech

1069
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,100
Or not

1070
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,100
A totally different topic

1071
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,100
Is IOT

1072
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,100
And home appliances

1073
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,100
You can buy

1074
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,100
Washing machines

1075
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,100
And ovens

1076
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,100
And all sorts of things

1077
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,100
With wifi built in

1078
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,100
These days

1079
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,100
But some of this stuff

1080
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,100
Is going to be in a basement

1081
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,100
Where wifi

1082
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,100
Might not be

1083
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,100
The best choice

1084
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,100
I am hoping

1085
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,100
That there is some compromise

1086
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,100
For all this

1087
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,100
Can you help me?

1088
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,100
This is an opportunity

1089
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,100
Because he is so early

1090
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,100
In the stage

1091
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,100
Of planning

1092
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,100
He can run

1093
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,100
Cat 7

1094
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,100
He could run

1095
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,100
Fiber if he wanted to

1096
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,100
I mean

1097
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,100
He could really go

1098
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,100
All out

1099
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,100
And he could also run

1100
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,100
Ethernet

1101
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,100
To wifi

1102
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,100
Access points

1103
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,100
This is how you get

1104
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,100
Your wifi

1105
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,100
Rock solid

1106
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,100
By the way

1107
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,100
Is you have multiple

1108
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,100
Wifi access points

1109
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,100
That have ethernet

1110
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,100
Run to them

1111
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,100
And that stuff

1112
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,100
Just works like

1113
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,100
Nearly like

1114
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,100
Ethernet

1115
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,100
I won't say

1116
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,100
Like ethernet

1117
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,100
Because nothing works

1118
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,100
Like ethernet

1119
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,100
But it's pretty close

1120
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,100
And if you're in this

1121
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,100
Man if you're in this

1122
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,100
Stage right now

1123
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,100
Anonymous

1124
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,100
You are

1125
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,100
You are in such

1126
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,100
A great position

1127
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,100
Two years before

1128
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,100
Your house was even

1129
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,100
Finished building

1130
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,100
Like you

1131
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,100
What a great

1132
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,100
So many choices

1133
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,100
But what a great

1134
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,100
Position to be in

1135
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,100
Well it's the ultimate

1136
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,100
Conclusion of being

1137
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,100
A self-hoster

1138
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:14,100
Isn't it?

1139
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,100
Is to be a self-builder

1140
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,100
So

1141
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,100
I think in my life plan

1142
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,100
At some point

1143
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,100
It might be

1144
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,100
Ten years away

1145
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,100
But I really want

1146
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,100
To build my own house

1147
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,100
And do all of this stuff

1148
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,100
And make all these decisions

1149
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,100
And to that point

1150
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,100
Another one of our

1151
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,100
Listeners

1152
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,100
Is

1153
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,100
Embarking on a similar

1154
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,100
Journey himself

1155
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,100
Up in Vermont

1156
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,100
My name is Matt

1157
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,100
And they have a YouTube channel

1158
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,100
Called Adventurous Way

1159
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,100
There'll be a link to it

1160
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,100
In the show notes

1161
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,100
They've literally only

1162
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,100
Just closed on the

1163
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,100
40 acre plot of land

1164
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,100
Up in Vermont

1165
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,100
And currently Chris

1166
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,100
They live in an RV

1167
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,100
So you know

1168
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,100
There's a lot of stuff

1169
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,100
A lot of synergy

1170
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,100
Between his approach

1171
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,100
To stuff and yours

1172
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,100
Right now

1173
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,100
So I'm really curious

1174
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,100
To see what they're doing

1175
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,100
I've just watched

1176
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,100
A video tonight

1177
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,100
Where they're cutting back

1178
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,100
All the trees

1179
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,100
On the land for example

1180
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,100
So they're doing it

1181
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,100
All themselves

1182
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,100
Pretty much

1183
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,100
Right from the very beginning

1184
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,100
And man does that

1185
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,100
Give me some excitement

1186
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:02,100
I think

1187
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,100
In the future

1188
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,100
I've just

1189
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,100
You've got to do it

1190
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,100
I've just got to do it

1191
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,100
I feel the same way

1192
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,100
I feel exactly the same way

1193
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,100
So I'm definitely going to

1194
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,100
Check out their channel

1195
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,100
I could see parking

1196
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,100
Lady Dupes on some land

1197
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:13,100
And building from there

1198
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,100
I think that'd be the ultimate

1199
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,100
Final destination

1200
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,100
For Lady Dupes

1201
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,100
If I could

1202
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,100
It'd be some piece of land

1203
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,100
That we park her on

1204
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,100
I can imagine a JB

1205
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,100
Commune right now

1206
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,100
Brent

1207
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,100
In his little

1208
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,100
House in the corner

1209
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,100
Totally

1210
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,100
Yes

1211
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,100
Yep

1212
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,100
Yeah

1213
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,100
You'd be there

1214
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,100
It'd be great

1215
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,100
Yeah man

1216
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,100
You know I've retrofitted

1217
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,100
Many homes in the last few decades

1218
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,100
With the technologies of the day

1219
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,100
And I think

1220
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,100
Part of my advice would be

1221
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,100
To look at the cost

1222
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,100
Of laying a bunch of cable

1223
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,100
Versus what you think the future

1224
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,100
Might bring in the next

1225
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,100
Even five years

1226
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,100
Because

1227
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,100
Some of the homes that

1228
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,100
I've lived in

1229
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,100
That have been retrofitted with

1230
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,100
Ethernet to every room

1231
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,100
Actually

1232
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,100
My parents home right now

1233
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,100
We didn't do this

1234
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,100
Because there's

1235
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,100
Ethernet run to every toilet

1236
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,100
You know

1237
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,100
Just in case you need

1238
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,100
The best

1239
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,100
Speeds possible

1240
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,100
I don't know why

1241
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,100
But I love that idea actually

1242
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,100
I see nothing wrong with that

1243
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,100
That seems reasonable

1244
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,100
But it turns out

1245
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,100
They never get used

1246
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,100
And nothing ever gets plugged in

1247
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,100
Because the wifi

1248
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,100
Even in the basement

1249
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,100
Is good enough for

1250
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,100
Most of the activities

1251
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,100
That ever happen in that home

1252
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:26,100
So I would use some imagination

1253
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,100
And think about where

1254
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,100
That's going to be

1255
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,100
In the next

1256
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,100
Five to ten years

1257
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,100
And think about

1258
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,100
If the cost is worth it

1259
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,100
I know there are people

1260
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,100
Tapping in their keyboards

1261
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,100
Furiously right now

1262
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,100
Run conduit

1263
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,100
And I think that's probably

1264
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,100
The best future proof

1265
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,100
Thing you can do

1266
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,100
Is to make sure

1267
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:42,100
There's plenty of conduit

1268
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:43,100
So you can upgrade

1269
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,100
The cables later

1270
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,100
Without having to

1271
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,100
Fish through walls

1272
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,100
Jonas writes in

1273
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,100
Along the same line

1274
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,100
He says

1275
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,100
I know you guys talk

1276
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,100
About networking a lot

1277
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,100
We're renovating our house

1278
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,100
We ran Cat 7 cables

1279
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,100
Almost to every room

1280
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,100
But we've discovered

1281
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,100
To Brent's point

1282
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,100
We're still using

1283
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,100
Wifi a ton

1284
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,100
And so now I'm looking

1285
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,100
At what are the right

1286
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,100
APs and switches

1287
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,100
To use here

1288
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,100
I heard you guys

1289
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,100
Mention recently

1290
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,100
That you don't think

1291
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,100
You'd recommend

1292
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,100
Unified gear anymore

1293
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,100
So now I'm kind of stuck

1294
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,100
Do I go with cheap stuff?

1295
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,100
Do I do unmanaged?

1296
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,100
Do I do managed switches?

1297
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,100
You know I'm looking

1298
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,100
For stuff in the range

1299
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:18,100
Of maybe a thousand dollars

1300
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,100
Somewhere in there

1301
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,100
Slightly professional gear

1302
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:21,100
But not too crazy

1303
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,100
And he wants to know

1304
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,100
If we have any recommendations

1305
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,100
This is a good point

1306
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,100
Like what do you do

1307
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,100
If you want really

1308
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,100
Great Wifi right now?

1309
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,100
I mean the reality

1310
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,100
Of the situation is

1311
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,100
I bought the Unifi access point

1312
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,100
I'm looking at right now

1313
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,100
From my desk in 2015

1314
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,100
And it has just done the job

1315
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,100
Extremely well since then

1316
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,100
Despite all of Unifi's wackiness

1317
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,100
With their policies

1318
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,100
Over the last year or two

1319
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,100
The hardware and the performance

1320
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,100
Of what I put in

1321
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,100
Has just been great

1322
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,100
I can't really fault

1323
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,100
The actual device

1324
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:56,100
So with regards to

1325
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,100
Would I purchase it again?

1326
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,100
I'm already in the Unifi ecosystem

1327
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,100
The pragmatist in me is going

1328
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,100
Yes I probably would

1329
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,100
If I needed a third access point

1330
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,100
In this house for example

1331
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,100
Just to make sure it all meshed

1332
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,100
And talked together properly

1333
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,100
I'd probably just buy another one

1334
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,100
I know that TP-Link

1335
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,100
Makes some good devices

1336
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,100
And Jim Salters written about those

1337
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,100
On Ars Technica a little bit

1338
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,100
There are lots of people over

1339
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,100
At smallnetbuilder.com

1340
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,100
That regularly review this stuff

1341
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,100
So if you're looking at

1342
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,100
What the best mesh system is

1343
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:27,100
Or the best Ethernet backhaul system is

1344
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,100
That's where I'd go for all that advice

1345
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,100
Rather than listening to what I know

1346
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,100
Now I won't pretend to be an expert

1347
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,100
But I do know some people who are

1348
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,100
And I will notably say

1349
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,100
My older brother Chris

1350
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:42,100
He very, very, very strongly recommends

1351
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,100
The microtik hardware and software

1352
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,100
In this area

1353
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,100
He's explored a bunch of it

1354
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,100
And he has been very happy

1355
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,100
Over many years

1356
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:56,100
With just how powerful their software is

1357
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,100
But also how it can be simple

1358
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:58,100
If you need it to be

1359
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:01,100
And the software that's available

1360
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,100
Is their professional software

1361
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,100
That gets sent to all of their devices

1362
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,100
So even if you buy their low-end hardware

1363
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,100
You get the same software

1364
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,100
So I would recommend looking into that

1365
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:11,100
I can't make any specific recommendations

1366
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,100
But when I asked him

1367
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,100
That's what he told me

1368
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,100
So passing that along

1369
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,100
This is an area I'd love to hear

1370
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,100
What people are using

1371
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,100
What are you actually using out there

1372
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,100
And how has it worked for you

1373
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,100
Because I'm also trying to find something else

1374
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,100
And there's so many mesh options out there

1375
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,100
But so, I think all of them

1376
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,100
If I'm not mistaken

1377
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,100
Require cloud connectivity

1378
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,100
Or some sort of cloud account

1379
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,100
And I just don't want any of that

1380
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,100
Unifi, I feel like I've already made

1381
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,100
That concession once before

1382
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,100
For the stuff we have in the studio

1383
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,100
So okay, that's already a concession I've made

1384
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,100
But I'd love some tips

1385
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,100
And if you're sticking with Unifi

1386
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,100
I'd love to know why too

1387
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,100
Selfhosted.show.com

1388
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,100
Did you see that the Grand Tour

1389
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,100
Aired an episode this week in Scotland?

1390
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,100
We watched it on the road actually

1391
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,100
As a family, we all sat down and watched it

1392
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:01,100
And had a great time

1393
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:02,100
It was more of like a classic episode

1394
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:03,100
I felt, Alex

1395
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,100
Did you get that sense?

1396
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,100
Yeah, for my stag do actually

1397
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,100
A buddy of mine and my dad

1398
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,100
We rented three cars

1399
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:13,100
And we did our own mini top gear road trip

1400
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,100
From Edinburgh actually

1401
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,100
We started in Edinburgh and finished in Edinburgh

1402
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,100
But in the intervening three or four days

1403
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,100
We went up to Inverness

1404
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,100
Drove down the side of Loch Ness

1405
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,100
Out to the Isle of Skye

1406
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,100
And then back through the Trossachs

1407
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,100
Oh man, I tell you what

1408
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,100
Scotland has some of the best driving roads

1409
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,100
Not cliche

1410
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:32,100
In the world

1411
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,100
It was just a phenomenal trip

1412
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,100
And to watch that episode

1413
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,100
Feeling as homesick as I am

1414
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,100
At the moment

1415
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:40,100
You know

1416
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,100
Ah, dude

1417
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,100
It was just so perfectly timed

1418
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,100
Yeah, they really made it beautiful too

1419
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,100
Yeah, those had to be some of the same roads, right?

1420
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,100
Some of them were, yeah

1421
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,100
And I tell you what brought me onto this topic

1422
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,100
Was

1423
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,100
I've been looking at mechanical keyboards lately

1424
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,100
And I came across a podcast

1425
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,100
Named Top Clack

1426
00:49:58,100 --> 00:49:59,100
You know, like Top Gear

1427
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,100
I just thought that was fun

1428
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,100
TopClack.com if you're a mech keyboard enthusiast

1429
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,100
Oh my goodness

1430
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,100
There is a podcast

1431
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,100
Are you kidding me?

1432
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,100
Of course there is

1433
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,100
Why am I surprised at all?

1434
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,100
Why am I surprised by that?

1435
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,100
I shouldn't be surprised by that

1436
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,100
Almost everyone we've met on this trip

1437
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,100
Has had a podcast

1438
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,100
That's true actually

1439
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,100
I was listening to your podcasting adventures

1440
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,100
About concrete in Idaho, so

1441
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,100
Yeah

1442
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,100
We did a couple of micro meetups

1443
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,100
And we had a group of five at one of them

1444
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,100
And literally every single person there had a podcast

1445
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,100
Then we did the Salt Lake City meetup

1446
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,100
And there was a handful of people there that had a podcast

1447
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,100
It's the influence you both had

1448
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,100
I don't know

1449
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,100
I don't know, but it was pretty crazy

1450
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,100
And Brent joined you for episode 418 of Linux Unplugged

1451
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:46,100
Where there was an absolutely excellent rundown of WireGuard user interfaces

1452
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,100
Yeah, and not only the tools to manage WireGuard

1453
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:52,100
But big news for people that want to use WireGuard on Windows

1454
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,100
There is an alternative to that user space implementation

1455
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,100
There is now a kernel space implementation

1456
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,100
And the performance difference is huge

1457
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,100
So Jim Salter from Ars Technica and Two and a Half Admins

1458
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:07,100
Joined us to talk about that on Unplugged 418

1459
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,100
At linuxunplugged.com

1460
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:13,100
That's huge with a Y at the beginning by the way

1461
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,100
Yeah, that's going to be a big deal for people that want to have

1462
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,100
Interconnected Windows and Linux machines

1463
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,100
Or just Windows to Windows machines

1464
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:21,100
And to be able to use WireGuard too

1465
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,100
You feel like this is probably going to take WireGuard up to the next level

1466
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,100
In the enterprise

1467
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,100
And you're going to see adoption now just across the board

1468
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,100
Once they get this code done

1469
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,100
It's early days, it's still experimental

1470
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,100
And Jim goes through all the details

1471
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,100
Also, we want to say a special thank you to our members

1472
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,100
Who support this show

1473
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,100
And to our reliability engineers who sign up at selfhosted.show.sre

1474
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,100
You are very special to us, in my heart

1475
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,100
Remember that? You are in my heart right now

1476
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,100
And I say thank you because as we're out here meeting people

1477
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,100
And we're doing a road trip like this

1478
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,100
And all of it, oh and we're also

1479
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,100
This is the other big part, is we're almost at a year now

1480
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,100
Of being independent again

1481
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,100
And all of this stuff about how critical our members have been

1482
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,100
And all of that has just been on my mind

1483
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,100
So thank you very much and if you'd like to support the show

1484
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,100
selfhosted.show.sre

1485
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:05,100
And don't forget if you're an SRE to listen to the post show

1486
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,100
There's going to be an exclusive discount code in there

1487
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:11,100
For the merch that we launched last episode

1488
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,100
The Chris and the Badger t-shirts are flying off the shelves

1489
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:17,100
And just to make sure that everybody that wants one gets one

1490
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,100
We're going to keep that up for another couple of weeks

1491
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,100
And then we're going to retire it

1492
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,100
And then after that it might make some future

1493
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,100
Special edition appearances, who knows

1494
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,100
But if you want one, make sure you go over there

1495
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:29,100
And pick one up now

1496
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,100
Because who knows when it will ever come back

1497
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:33,100
So we're going to extend that discount code

1498
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,100
For two more weeks

1499
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,100
And come say hi to Chris, Brent and myself

1500
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,100
