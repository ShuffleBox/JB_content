WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
Coming up on the show with rage in our hearts. We proclaim a self-hosted Google Photos replacement and

00:06.360 --> 00:14.260
The only way to conceivably self-host your own email with a caveat. I'm Chris and I'm Alex and this is self-hosted

00:15.440 --> 00:18.920
I've been looking at buying my wife a Nintendo switch now

00:18.920 --> 00:20.400
I know that you've got one

00:20.400 --> 00:27.080
But I can't find them in stock anywhere and I'm trying to decide between the switch light and the switch like full

00:27.080 --> 00:34.760
Version talk me through these options. This is perpetually the problem with Nintendo. I can't believe they still are having stock issues

00:34.840 --> 00:36.720
I know they sell very well

00:36.720 --> 00:43.200
But I always wonder if this is like part of Nintendo's marketing strategy to intentionally always leave high demand

00:43.760 --> 00:46.360
so yeah, we own a few switches in the family because

00:46.860 --> 00:49.720
You know, sometimes it's more fun when you have multiple switches

00:49.720 --> 00:52.780
It really comes down to this if she's gonna have a dock most the time

00:52.780 --> 00:58.440
I don't think it matters if she's gonna carry it around and use it and actually play on the screen. The light looks kind of nice

00:58.440 --> 01:03.160
I don't have the light. I have the regular sized one because I wanted to install Linux on it

01:03.880 --> 01:05.880
Of course

01:06.800 --> 01:10.160
So do that, I think you can with the older ones

01:10.160 --> 01:15.600
I so there was a hardware fix that Nintendo had to issue so I bought right before the hardware fix made it out

01:15.600 --> 01:22.400
You know, like I was watching the news and this hardware vulnerability was discovered and I knew it would be a matter of months

01:22.400 --> 01:24.400
and so I ordered one and then

01:24.440 --> 01:28.160
Surely like that that week almost they had had announced that a new

01:28.880 --> 01:30.880
revised model

01:30.880 --> 01:36.440
How's that going? Is it your portable Linux system your go-to? Oh, yeah all the time

01:36.440 --> 01:39.320
No, never even tried because the games are great

01:40.680 --> 01:42.680
You're so funny

01:42.680 --> 01:48.880
Yeah, it turns out so I say whichever one you can get your hands on you're gonna be happy with you may try eBay, man

01:48.880 --> 01:53.160
Maybe I'm sure somebody's got it on eBay. Yeah, there's a lot of scalpers though. I don't want to pay above retail

01:53.600 --> 01:57.160
Maybe a listener has a used one. They'd sell you for a good price. Sure

01:57.840 --> 02:02.480
Get in touch ironic badger on Twitter. Yeah, or you can hit the contact page or something

02:02.480 --> 02:07.920
I want to mention that this episode is brought to you by the all-new a cloud guru the leader in learning for cloud Linux and other

02:07.920 --> 02:13.400
Modern tech skills, you can get hundreds of courses thousands of hands-on labs. You can get certified get hired and get learning

02:13.400 --> 02:15.520
You just have to go to a cloud guru calm

02:16.080 --> 02:19.200
Well Alex, we have several cool topics to talk about cool

02:19.200 --> 02:26.480
I'm dating myself there when I say that we have some some cool topics Alex. Um, we thought maybe we'd discuss two big

02:27.360 --> 02:30.560
areas of self-hosting for the home and

02:31.200 --> 02:34.880
Photos being one of them, especially with the news about Google photos

02:34.880 --> 02:41.920
which we'll get in get into later and Audiobooks which you and I are both pretty passionate about and there's a couple of different options a

02:41.920 --> 02:45.360
couple of different self-hosted solutions you can throw at these problems and

02:46.080 --> 02:50.960
It kind of I think maybe is best to start with like the awkward

02:51.280 --> 02:56.160
Elephant in the room that we just kind of have to address getting hold of the audiobooks now

02:56.480 --> 02:58.480
one of the goals of this show was to

02:58.480 --> 03:04.640
Showcase all the things you can do a self-hosting and avoid piracy. Obviously, that's a hot topic

03:04.720 --> 03:09.840
and it's it's not something that I really condone or anything like that, but you know

03:10.640 --> 03:12.640
for me, I think audiobooks are

03:13.600 --> 03:15.600
straddling a fine line because

03:16.400 --> 03:20.880
Let's say we're using audible and I certainly think that's what you and I both are using

03:21.520 --> 03:26.080
You pay for credits every month. I think they're about 10 bucks or 15 bucks a month

03:26.080 --> 03:31.520
for a credit that credit allows you to buy in their terminology buy a book

03:32.160 --> 03:36.320
Except for the fact that that book is locked into the Amazon audible ecosystem

03:36.960 --> 03:39.360
Until the end of time and we've actually had this happen

03:40.000 --> 03:41.120
that

03:41.120 --> 03:45.680
Audible have decided to remove a book from our account because the publisher has changed

03:46.720 --> 03:52.560
The terms of the agreement or something and you know, this is fairly common and pervasive among streaming providers with

03:52.560 --> 03:56.880
Licensing deals changing all the time and stuff like that. So this isn't you know, it's not a new problem

03:57.680 --> 04:02.240
But one of the things I really like to do is download the book from audible that I've purchased

04:02.320 --> 04:08.880
And strip the DRM from it and then I own it forever. And um, i've been an audible customer for I think 13 years

04:08.880 --> 04:11.460
It was something like that. It's been a long time. I still have an active subscription

04:12.160 --> 04:18.160
And about once a quarter I just download my latest purchased books and I store them offline myself

04:18.160 --> 04:23.680
And I use a tool called open audible to do that open audible is a 12 shareware

04:24.240 --> 04:25.680
product and

04:25.680 --> 04:31.760
It requires that you have an audible sign-in a valid audible account that you log in you sync your library down

04:32.080 --> 04:37.680
And then it will identify each of the books. It'll pull down the information about the title the description

04:38.320 --> 04:44.560
Album art and if that's what you call it on a book cover art, I suppose and then it it begins the cpc

04:44.560 --> 04:48.880
You intensive process of removing the DRM and saving you a playable

04:49.580 --> 04:54.720
Audiobook that you can use in anything that that plays back essentially m4a's or mp3s

04:55.200 --> 04:58.500
I use another option and this is a windows option called inaudible

04:59.120 --> 05:03.860
And this one lets you divide things up into you know, separate files per chapter

05:04.400 --> 05:07.920
as well as embedding cover art and stuff like that, uh removing the

05:08.720 --> 05:11.200
This is audible in the first place

05:11.200 --> 05:15.280
removing the this is audible, you know intro

05:15.920 --> 05:20.080
Uh and that kind of thing. It's pretty nice. Um, I don't know where I got it from

05:20.240 --> 05:24.080
I think a friend on discord somewhere a few years ago, but it works pretty well

05:25.040 --> 05:31.440
That's like the modern version of in an alley from a shady dude with a van. Yeah, it is but uh, you know

05:32.000 --> 05:33.760
laws will differ

05:33.760 --> 05:41.680
Based on where you live as to as to the legality of doing this and I think there's there is um, other

05:41.680 --> 05:47.920
Outlets besides audible where you can get audiobooks. In fact, I have a batch from core doctora that I just bought directly from him

05:48.320 --> 05:52.500
So there's multiple ways of course to get audiobooks. So once you have these audiobooks

05:53.200 --> 05:55.200
you have to be able to play them back and

05:55.600 --> 05:58.560
Playing back an audiobook is it's a special beast

05:58.560 --> 06:05.780
It's not like playing back music you want to be able to play back and resume your position. You maybe want something that supports chapters

06:06.160 --> 06:08.800
Perhaps you'd even like something that has a sleep timer

06:08.800 --> 06:13.360
If you have some books you go to sleep with like I do I like all these features to be built in

06:13.920 --> 06:19.680
Uh to my to my audiobook player and i've managed to get that to some degree of success

06:20.080 --> 06:24.000
I'm curious what you've employed in this area for playing your own self-hosted audiobooks

06:24.000 --> 06:29.520
Well, the primary consumer of audiobooks in this house is my wife. She is a vociferous reader

06:29.920 --> 06:32.800
And that extends to listening to books as well because obviously you can

06:33.440 --> 06:36.640
Listen to audiobooks whilst you're doing the washing up or or anything else, you know

06:37.520 --> 06:42.160
And she uh has been using now for several years book sonic

06:42.400 --> 06:50.400
So I I host a book sonic server out of a docker container and this is based around the old subsonic

06:50.400 --> 06:55.780
code base, but there have been some tweaks as you say, you know to provide support for

06:56.400 --> 07:02.500
Remembering last playback position also supporting the chapters and that kind of thing and and the offline caching

07:02.960 --> 07:07.300
Aspect of audiobooks, which is which is really important particularly on mobile devices

07:08.100 --> 07:14.660
So my wife is a google fi subscriber. So every gigabyte she uses when she's out and about she has to pay for

07:15.220 --> 07:19.140
So it makes a lot of sense for her to cash an entire book at once listen to the book

07:19.140 --> 07:23.540
And then no matter what wi-fi network she's on when she's driving or or anything like that

07:24.100 --> 07:30.580
There's no data cost associated with that. So there are book sonic apps available for android and ios

07:31.060 --> 07:36.340
They're a little bit basic in terms of the ui, but their functionality is is top notch and very reliable

07:37.140 --> 07:39.220
and uh being based on subsonic

07:40.340 --> 07:41.700
there is a

07:41.700 --> 07:47.780
Web ui to the container as well, which you just access in a browser and you can play your books back that way as well

07:47.780 --> 07:50.820
Well, that sounds like a winner book sonic right there

07:51.300 --> 07:54.020
Um, i'd say a low hanging but not ideal

07:54.500 --> 08:00.180
Approach might be to integrate it into plex if you already have something like plex set up. I don't like it a lot

08:00.660 --> 08:07.380
It doesn't have a sleep timer for one thing. There's other issues along with playback, but it does does remember the position

08:08.500 --> 08:13.220
And it is nice to have all of my books displayed up on the tv. I do enjoy that

08:13.220 --> 08:17.620
I voted for audiobook support in plex as a plex pass subscriber

08:18.020 --> 08:21.700
The best part of a decade ago on their forums and it's just gone nowhere

08:22.340 --> 08:28.740
There are some threads, uh on reddit, which if I can find them i'll put them in the show notes, but

08:29.220 --> 08:34.740
There are threads of people that have gone to a lot of effort to shoehorn audiobook support

08:35.300 --> 08:38.580
Uh into plex which includes stuff like a metadata agent

08:38.580 --> 08:43.540
The nuances come in when you want to start marking chapters as played

08:43.620 --> 08:49.940
That sounds a really simple thing, but the way plex marks things as played is once you get over a certain percentage

08:50.500 --> 08:54.740
I think it's like 90 or 95 percent. It marks the episode

08:55.380 --> 09:02.500
Or track as played which if you are, you know watching a tv show and you just turn it off before the credits are done

09:02.500 --> 09:08.580
Or a movie, you know that five percent is is within the margin of error where most of the time that just works

09:09.380 --> 09:15.700
So you've got a few different ways to slice up an audiobook. You can have one monolithic file. That could be 20

09:16.420 --> 09:18.180
30 hours long

09:18.180 --> 09:20.340
Or the chapters could be a few minutes long

09:20.900 --> 09:27.860
And so that margin of error suddenly goes from being you know on a multi-hour file from being a big margin to being

09:27.860 --> 09:33.780
You know 30 seconds, which if you pause your your playback within that percentage

09:34.260 --> 09:40.180
Plex will mark that chapter as played and you'll miss that percentage of that chapter and it'll take you straight to the next one. So

09:40.740 --> 09:42.740
It's not perfect. Nope, not so much

09:43.060 --> 09:48.340
Um, you can you can do it you can get by but I don't think either one of us really recommend it

09:48.900 --> 09:54.900
But staying on the topic of mobile just for a moment on the ios side. I really like and recommend book player

09:54.900 --> 09:59.620
It plays most audiobook formats and mp3 audiobooks, obviously

10:00.180 --> 10:04.820
It's an ios app that has multiple ways to import the audio files into the app

10:04.900 --> 10:09.620
It has some basic functionality like you'd expect like changing the playback speed

10:10.260 --> 10:16.740
Sleep timer then it has some quality of life features, too that I like it has volume boost. It has smart rewind

10:17.380 --> 10:20.980
And it has carplay support and I really appreciate that

10:20.980 --> 10:26.980
It's just called book player one word on ios and something else that I think is really great about it is it is gpl3

10:27.060 --> 10:29.060
So it's open source. It's on github

10:29.460 --> 10:33.220
And um, I think that's just nice to see on the ios platform as well book player

10:33.860 --> 10:36.660
one word and um, geez, it's got a pretty

10:37.300 --> 10:42.420
Pretty good for 4.8 rating. I hadn't really uh to pay attention to I was looking at it for the show

10:42.740 --> 10:47.780
But that's pretty good almost a five-star rating for an app is pretty rare book player if you're on ios check that one out

10:47.780 --> 10:52.980
I'm, looking at another one and this one does plug into plex and it's called prologue. Oh, yeah, which

10:53.540 --> 10:58.660
Advertises itself and this is ios only unfortunately for me being an android kiddie

10:59.300 --> 11:05.460
Uh, this one advertises itself as the ultimate audiobook player for plex on uh on ios

11:05.540 --> 11:08.260
So a couple of options. Yeah, and I have this one

11:08.420 --> 11:12.420
Um, actually haven't used it very much because I kind of just cooled on the old

11:12.420 --> 11:19.380
Uh using plex for audiobooks approach anyways, but I I think uh, you know, maybe after the show i'll give prologue a

11:19.940 --> 11:22.280
Another shot because I actually have the app already installed

11:23.460 --> 11:26.980
Just hadn't really given it a shot yet, but it looks really good. The ui is pretty tight

11:27.540 --> 11:29.060
um, and it

11:29.060 --> 11:34.020
Claims and this is why I got it alex is it claims to solve that playback percentage issue that you were talking about?

11:34.500 --> 11:38.180
Yeah, that's good. It's if it solves that problem. That is the biggest problem with plex and uh,

11:38.180 --> 11:44.260
an audiobook playback, but what about on the linux desktop? Is there anything there? I like cozy

11:44.500 --> 11:49.780
I'll link to the flathub installer if you want to give it a try. It's a minimal modern looking

11:50.800 --> 11:53.780
Audiobook player so go in with expectations set to

11:54.640 --> 11:55.940
minimal

11:55.940 --> 12:00.260
But it does the basics right it listens to your drm free books. It has a sleep timer

12:00.260 --> 12:04.020
It has playback controls for each book so you can set them per book. I like that

12:04.020 --> 12:09.460
And uh, oh, it also allows you to do multiple storage location support. That's kind of nice

12:09.460 --> 12:14.660
I have had scenarios where i've needed that before and you know, I like this offline mode

12:15.220 --> 12:22.580
So you can just store something on internal storage this I think will also be a good mobile app for like the future

12:23.040 --> 12:25.040
convergence where you have

12:25.060 --> 12:25.940
posh

12:25.940 --> 12:26.820
driven

12:26.820 --> 12:31.300
pine 64 mobile devices, I think this is going to be a really good

12:31.300 --> 12:35.700
pine 64 mobile devices. I think this may actually end up being a

12:36.500 --> 12:41.300
A mobile audiobook player in the future as well. I'm sure those three people that do that will be really happy

12:42.100 --> 12:43.700
Yeah, well

12:43.700 --> 12:47.700
Yeah, and then their audiobook player will work on their desktop and their phone because it's the same one

12:49.940 --> 12:52.180
Oh, i'm sorry to those three people if i've upset you

12:53.860 --> 12:55.380
Linode.com

12:55.380 --> 13:03.140
Ssh go there to get a 100 68 credit towards a new account at linode and you support your boys here at the self-hosted podcast

13:03.380 --> 13:05.380
Linode is our cloud hosting provider

13:05.380 --> 13:07.220
We spin infrastructure up to test on the show

13:07.220 --> 13:13.860
But it also runs the back end cloud infrastructure of jupiter broadcasting and all my personal stuff is on linode

13:13.940 --> 13:19.460
I started using them just over two years ago. And when it was time to take jupiter broadcasting independent

13:19.940 --> 13:23.060
I said let's build it on linode and it's been fantastic

13:23.060 --> 13:25.780
And you know, one of the things I love about them is they're independently owned

13:26.020 --> 13:30.580
They were founded on a love for linux and open source technologies back then it was user mode linux

13:30.580 --> 13:36.580
But of course they've evolved their system over the years to take advantage of the latest virtualization and container technologies in linux

13:36.900 --> 13:40.020
They give you full back end access to your linodes when you spin something up

13:40.260 --> 13:47.300
I used that recently to actually re-image the os drive of one of my linux linodes using their official how-to guide

13:47.460 --> 13:49.540
And they have the tools that make all of that possible

13:49.540 --> 13:53.060
I love that kind of stuff on top of the virtual servers though

13:53.300 --> 13:57.700
They have object storage now if you're thinking about building yourself a super fast static website

13:57.780 --> 14:02.580
Maybe for a resume for yourself for family for the holidays check out their object storage

14:02.980 --> 14:07.460
I use their s3 compatible object storage to host the clips that I play on shows

14:07.940 --> 14:13.140
So we will integrate the clips right into our show notes because our show notes are all written in markdown

14:13.140 --> 14:19.700
I can embed audio files in line that actually are hosted on the node's object storage

14:19.780 --> 14:25.300
You can use that for website assets. You could even use it as a quick cdn for your for your projects

14:26.020 --> 14:27.540
Distribution. I mean think about it

14:27.540 --> 14:32.260
There's a lot you can do with s3 compatible object storage when you're not paying amazon's prices

14:32.420 --> 14:36.740
Linode costs 30 to 50 less than major cloud providers like aws

14:37.300 --> 14:41.460
So there's a lot of advantage to going over to linode plus when you go to linode.com

14:41.460 --> 14:45.460
Go to linode.com slash ssh you get that one hundred dollar credit

14:47.540 --> 14:52.660
One hundred dollars and you also support the show. I mean it's like a win-win so check them out

14:52.900 --> 14:57.140
Linode is dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing if it runs on linux

14:57.300 --> 14:59.780
It runs on linode and there's a lot you can do with that

15:00.180 --> 15:02.580
You know, you know just go check it out and then tell me what you do

15:02.660 --> 15:06.660
I've been asking people to tweet me at chris las or you can hit me up on the telegram

15:06.660 --> 15:11.380
What are you doing with your linode once you spin it up linode.com slash ssh

15:11.380 --> 15:16.520
Thanks to everybody who supports the show and supports our sponsor by going to linode.com slash ssh

15:18.260 --> 15:23.140
Time for some feedback. Don't forget you can send in yours at selfosted.show slash contact

15:23.380 --> 15:26.260
Our first one comes from jeff. Yeah friend of the show jeff

15:26.340 --> 15:32.500
He writes and he says I have an ubuntu machine serving dual purposes as my home server and htpc

15:32.500 --> 15:36.980
This is a chris side note. This seems to be a really super common setup

15:37.060 --> 15:43.060
And if you think about it, if you really only have budget or space or whatever for one computer, why not make it?

15:43.620 --> 15:49.540
Like a cody playback or a plex playback machine and a server or he lives in california where electricity isn't cheap

15:50.820 --> 15:53.860
Yeah, although he does mess around with some solar so he might be able to figure that out

15:54.180 --> 15:55.220
Uh, but uh

15:55.220 --> 16:00.500
He goes on to say i'm running the next cloud snap in the background with plasma 5 as my tv front end

16:00.500 --> 16:03.780
Since ubuntu's app completely breaks on me every time I use

16:04.900 --> 16:06.900
use ubuntu seriously

16:08.180 --> 16:14.020
Is i'm looking to rebase my system on something else I would like to move to next cloud to a containerized setup

16:14.340 --> 16:18.420
But I failed to properly even set up the most basic docker images in the past

16:18.740 --> 16:25.780
My biggest hurdle is understanding the database stuff and how they can connect not being able to just navigate file structure and see the files

16:26.100 --> 16:29.780
Well, it breaks my brain and plus i'm using the next cloud snap

16:29.780 --> 16:35.140
I'm going to have issues moving the files out of the bear of the database buried in the snap itself

16:35.940 --> 16:41.460
Well by default next cloud does use sql lite for data storage. So that's kind of built into the container

16:41.780 --> 16:46.820
You can also link a database of mysql as well. So maybe that's what you're thinking of

16:47.140 --> 16:50.980
I I wonder if it's only him and a couple of family members like he says here in the email

16:51.060 --> 16:55.540
Does he need to have a more robust database? I appreciate there's a performance difference

16:55.540 --> 17:00.420
But there's also the simplicity. I mean this must be what the snap is using already now that I think about it

17:00.500 --> 17:02.900
Yeah, it must be and and to be honest with you. This is uh,

17:03.540 --> 17:07.380
This is one of my issues with snaps as a whole on the server

17:07.940 --> 17:12.740
Right. I appreciate that snap install next cloud is very easy, but it's also

17:13.540 --> 17:20.660
Dare I say I don't want to sound like gatekeeper here, but it's almost too easy. But couldn't you make that argument for docker? Well, uh,

17:21.620 --> 17:23.700
Maybe maybe you could um

17:23.700 --> 17:28.660
But I think there is a difference right with a with a snap. The the data is kind of

17:29.300 --> 17:34.340
Baked in and it's a it's a not as much of an industry standard as docker is

17:34.740 --> 17:38.340
Oh and with docker you have the data external of the image

17:39.060 --> 17:45.780
And so you could blow away the container, but the data remains and also there is an official next cloud docker image with decent

17:46.240 --> 17:48.820
Documentation that talks about volumes right from the get-go

17:49.700 --> 17:51.700
whereas a snap is this kind of

17:51.700 --> 17:55.380
And I i'm really reluctant to to to bash on snaps so hard

17:55.460 --> 18:01.620
But they're just a black box and i've had to help several people extract data from snaps that got things up and running

18:01.940 --> 18:05.460
That they didn't really understand what was going on under the hood, which is great

18:05.540 --> 18:11.540
And I think in terms of enabling people to to do stuff that they wouldn't otherwise do is is a good thing

18:12.100 --> 18:18.500
But the flip side of that is that you don't necessarily plan well enough to you know a data storage strategy

18:18.500 --> 18:24.660
Which volume is going to go explicitly where all that kind of stuff. Yeah, and with docker compose you kind of have this

18:25.220 --> 18:30.820
Reference guide you can go back to to see how you built things and where you specified the that the data volume was

18:31.380 --> 18:36.180
And if you build a snap and you create the yaml file that does all that you would have that those same insights

18:36.580 --> 18:38.580
But it's just a different workflow

18:38.660 --> 18:42.580
He goes on to ask a question that I think maybe we could we could kind of help him with here. He says

18:42.580 --> 18:47.700
Do you guys have any tips or resources to learn about this stuff as a home user level? I am no sysadmin

18:47.700 --> 18:49.300
He doesn't do it for his day job

18:49.300 --> 18:53.220
And he doesn't have a lot of database and container experience. A lot of it goes over his head

18:53.620 --> 18:58.760
He's wondering if we have any tips to migrate his snap next cloud to a proper database

18:59.380 --> 19:00.020
and

19:00.020 --> 19:03.700
I kind of felt like the solution here would be to keep it simple

19:04.580 --> 19:09.140
And start fresh with a next cloud container that uses an internal sqlite database

19:09.140 --> 19:13.940
And manually migrate your data over because a lot of the like if you think about it the cal dev stuff

19:14.660 --> 19:18.420
The the ical stuff all of that will just export just fine if you can do that

19:18.660 --> 19:20.660
Just export it set it up fresh

19:21.300 --> 19:27.300
In the container and then when you're ready move to a to a separate database as a separate project

19:27.780 --> 19:32.420
Another option is to install an xcal client on a system

19:33.140 --> 19:35.140
Sync sync down all your data

19:35.140 --> 19:41.620
sign out of server a the snap server and then sign into server b and point server b at that directory and

19:41.940 --> 19:44.180
It will just re-upload the stuff to the new instance

19:44.740 --> 19:47.780
yeah, absolutely and the next cloud cli client is

19:48.580 --> 19:52.500
The trick that i've used before to move next cloud server. So that is a good way to go and that's

19:53.140 --> 19:58.180
Not bad jeff, and I don't think you need to solve it all in one go either. Uh, if you're talking

19:58.900 --> 20:02.500
10 users or less you may find that the server is not going to be able to do that

20:02.500 --> 20:06.180
10 users or less you may find that the sql light

20:06.720 --> 20:08.720
performance is

20:08.740 --> 20:11.780
perfectly adequate especially because he talks in here about maybe

20:12.900 --> 20:16.500
Using a linode credit to build something and maybe set it up there

20:16.980 --> 20:20.760
That instance is probably going to be so much faster than your htpc

20:21.380 --> 20:26.340
That you'll never run into performance issues with the sql light database. It's super handy to have a uh

20:26.820 --> 20:31.140
a next cloud instance running in the cloud on a linode or something like that because

20:31.140 --> 20:32.340
it

20:32.340 --> 20:34.980
It means if your power goes out at your house

20:35.140 --> 20:40.660
It's still up if you don't want to punch holes in your firewall. It's available nice and easily

20:41.140 --> 20:46.500
Outside the downside of that is it means it's outside your firewall, which means that people might be

20:47.460 --> 20:50.900
You know port scanning you and bashing on it and trying to break into it. So

20:51.700 --> 20:57.860
Linode has this kind of firewall feature where you can disable and enable certain ports and stuff like that

20:57.940 --> 20:59.940
You know like you would in your home firewall

20:59.940 --> 21:06.180
Um, so i'd recommend using that if you're going to put it in linode just to lock down the attack surface as much as possible

21:06.420 --> 21:10.740
and then also consider from a data strategy standpoint now now you have

21:11.620 --> 21:15.860
Your home system and you'll have an offsite system and now you can sync between them

21:15.860 --> 21:20.840
So you could you could back up your next cloud linode instance locally to your htpc

21:21.300 --> 21:25.060
And if you have some really valuable stuff on that htpc like configs or whatever

21:25.300 --> 21:27.220
You could now back that up offsite to linode

21:27.220 --> 21:32.500
So there's some data security advantages you could now also employ. So that's a probably not a bad way to go

21:33.140 --> 21:40.420
Speaking of self-hosting. Do you want to take our next email do jit code is am I i'm butchering that do guys go?

21:42.580 --> 21:48.180
Do you get code writes in I was listening to episode 31 and I want to disagree whilst still agreeing

21:48.740 --> 21:51.860
With your opinion on the difficulty of self-hosting an email server

21:51.860 --> 21:57.540
Uh too long didn't read you can still partially hybrid self-host your emails and gain benefit

21:57.940 --> 22:03.300
Emails a wonderful stack of tech that's often built with the unix mindset of do one thing and do it

22:03.300 --> 22:08.500
Well, and this is why I often encourage people to at least self-host a receiving email server

22:08.820 --> 22:15.460
Whilst farming out the sending portion to an smtp relay like mailgun or amazon's ses

22:15.460 --> 22:21.620
Yes, you know, this is why I actually did contact mail route and I said you guys should become sponsors of our shows

22:22.340 --> 22:26.660
Because I really believe this setup is actually solid and every time we fail to mention it

22:26.820 --> 22:31.460
I think about it after the show because if I was going to host my email and i've been thinking about it

22:31.460 --> 22:36.260
Sometimes I would do it exactly like this. I would have mail route

22:36.900 --> 22:39.300
sponsor our show guys right in front of

22:39.300 --> 22:45.780
My email server and that would do all of the nitty-gritty sending and receiving and the spam checking and all of that

22:46.020 --> 22:48.980
It would be up when my home system is down. It could do a queue

22:49.540 --> 22:54.340
It would deal with all of the domain blacklist issues. And of course, they're a known good provider at this point

22:54.340 --> 22:55.860
So they've been around forever

22:55.860 --> 22:58.180
So if I were going to build email today

22:58.820 --> 23:03.940
I would set up a LAN server that only receives email from the mail route service

23:04.580 --> 23:07.860
Let's see. It doesn't receive email and the LAN it could receive email from the LAN

23:07.860 --> 23:11.540
You've got to wonder how long it is before google cancelled gmail, don't you? No

23:12.100 --> 23:16.500
Never never going to happen from an advertising perspective. I I know that but no, you know what?

23:16.500 --> 23:18.020
You know what? I've been thinking about gmail

23:18.020 --> 23:25.860
It's really about it's about the mining because you who doesn't have their receipt sent to their gmail account everything you purchase

23:26.340 --> 23:30.100
That even if it's not through a google pay app or anything like that if your email

23:30.740 --> 23:33.460
Goes to your inbox google knows what you've been buying

23:34.180 --> 23:37.220
That's so valuable. There's no way they'll ever turn that off

23:37.220 --> 23:41.060
It's true. I'll tell you what my mother-in-law's computer broke last week and I

23:41.680 --> 23:45.620
Reconstructed what computer I built for her four years ago through my gmail inbox. So

23:46.260 --> 23:54.440
It's useful. Yeah, so, uh, I I really like this hybrid email approach and I actually feel like maybe I may start adjusting

23:55.060 --> 23:58.820
My future answer about self-hosting email is do it but just don't

23:59.380 --> 24:02.580
don't be responsible for directly sending and receiving email and I

24:02.580 --> 24:07.380
I I can't believe I didn't think of saying this the last couple times has come up on the show because

24:07.700 --> 24:10.420
This is how I have built it for my clients in the past

24:10.980 --> 24:14.260
This is just it's it's how I would it's it's how I would do it

24:14.340 --> 24:20.420
And if you're willing to self-host your email, then you need to consider a good intermediary. There's mail routes one of them

24:20.420 --> 24:24.260
There's other of there's like postini used to be one but google bought them

24:24.580 --> 24:31.240
There's these that these intermediary services that become trusted well-established players in the email ecosystem

24:31.240 --> 24:37.480
And they provide the sending and receiving they provide the queuing and it's it's wonderful

24:37.560 --> 24:43.480
That's why they should sponsor because you could you could very successfully set up a system like he's talking about at the end of the

24:43.480 --> 24:44.520
day though

24:44.520 --> 24:50.760
You still have users that are relying on a service that really becomes integrated with their life

24:50.920 --> 24:55.960
You know when they're emailing attorneys or they're emailing people at their church or they're figuring out stuff for their kids school

24:56.200 --> 24:57.800
It's all happening on email

24:57.800 --> 25:01.640
So even if it's just a few family members when you start hosting their email you

25:02.040 --> 25:07.960
You really discover how much email matters when it goes out and that's a responsibility that you really have to take seriously

25:08.040 --> 25:10.920
Yeah, it's a bit more serious than I can't watch plex

25:11.480 --> 25:15.560
yeah, or even a chat system being down right because you can still pick up the phone and call but

25:15.960 --> 25:22.360
The thing about email is it is a box of expectations and people can just drop an expectation in there

25:22.360 --> 25:27.880
And so you can have people outside of your world that are sending an expectation into that inbox

25:28.040 --> 25:30.200
And if your email is down and you didn't receive it

25:30.200 --> 25:36.120
They still expected you that you got it and that you're going to be taking action on it and it has domino effects

25:36.360 --> 25:39.560
Very true and now brian writes in saying hey guys

25:39.720 --> 25:44.600
I've been using home assistant for about a year now and I really enjoy the home assistant segments on the show

25:44.600 --> 25:51.800
I've heard you mention mqtt a few times and was wondering if you could tell me more about it and its benefits with home assistant

25:52.520 --> 25:59.560
So chris, do you use mqtt for anything? No, that's why I really like this question from brian because uh, I have like

25:59.800 --> 26:04.360
Uh home assistant fomo a little bit, but i'm well, I mean i'm almost

26:05.000 --> 26:12.120
Two years into using home assistant now. I can't keep track anymore. I've never actually had the need i've gotten close to setting it up

26:12.120 --> 26:15.800
But i've never pulled the trigger. So I I know you use it quite extensively

26:15.800 --> 26:19.240
So I thought maybe you could kind of explain it to us since i'm obviously not

26:19.800 --> 26:27.800
As hands-on experienced I understand in the abstract, but i'd like to hear from you. I use mqtt for my tasmota devices

26:28.440 --> 26:34.280
However, more recently I found that it's becoming less and less necessary in the home assistant world

26:34.840 --> 26:39.960
Simply because the native home assistant api integration is becoming that much more mature

26:39.960 --> 26:47.480
So if you know a couple of years ago when I gave that first talk at linux fest northwest about home assistant and mqtt

26:47.480 --> 26:48.920
And that kind of thing

26:48.920 --> 26:55.320
There weren't as many native home assistant api integrations. And so it was a it was a lot more necessary back then

26:56.360 --> 27:02.520
And so the thing that I use it for the most is for I think my tasmota smart plugs

27:03.160 --> 27:05.160
Whenever they are doing something

27:05.160 --> 27:11.240
They publish, you know, they're the amount of current going through the plug their current state, you know

27:11.240 --> 27:17.800
The the last time they were rebooted all of these things get sent to specific topics as messages

27:18.760 --> 27:25.640
What other mqtt clients can do of which home assistant is one of them is they can subscribe to those topics?

27:26.280 --> 27:32.200
And react when certain types of messages come in so think of it rather than you know

27:32.200 --> 27:38.600
Like the infrared remote kind of model where you you blast out information in the hopes that somebody's going to be receiving it

27:39.560 --> 27:42.120
mqtt is doing the blasting of

27:43.480 --> 27:48.520
Information but it's also able to contextually figure out whether that message was received

27:49.000 --> 27:54.360
When it gets a certain response on a different topic, so you could have different states of things

27:54.920 --> 28:00.600
Being received like a garage door. It could say garage door is currently open by publishing to a specific topic

28:00.600 --> 28:07.720
A certain message that kind of thing. So it's it's useful when your iot devices need a two-way

28:08.520 --> 28:10.520
kind of contextual

28:10.840 --> 28:15.240
Awareness of each other and I think the other nice aspect of it is it's essentially

28:15.800 --> 28:20.920
As lightweight as it gets and it's not necessarily dependent to run over tcp

28:20.920 --> 28:26.440
But it most commonly does and that that subscribe model means that a low-powered device

28:26.440 --> 28:33.400
Could only subscribe to the things that the topics that it absolutely needs to and so it doesn't have to maybe check in as often

28:33.400 --> 28:38.280
And run the cpu as much which saves battery life. Yeah, and a nice example would be something

28:39.080 --> 28:44.440
In the connected world where like my car tells my house to open my garage door

28:45.000 --> 28:51.400
And start my coffee maker or something like that. That's that series of events needs to send a bunch of messages

28:51.400 --> 28:56.280
Across a various different number of apis and and the idea behind mqtt

28:57.000 --> 29:01.320
Was to unify those apis behind what's called a broker

29:01.800 --> 29:07.080
So each of those devices the car would publish a message to the broker

29:07.720 --> 29:13.880
Under a specific topic and then another device would be subscribed to that topic and react based on that message

29:14.360 --> 29:19.240
And the nice thing is is the car doesn't have to remain online because the broker holds that message

29:19.240 --> 29:24.840
Correct. Yep. Mm-hmm. Also another way to save battery life. It's nice. If you have some leds, for example

29:24.840 --> 29:27.720
You want to know what color they are, you know home assistant

29:28.440 --> 29:30.440
And others, you know, um

29:30.760 --> 29:34.840
Smart lighting systems are only as smart as the last message they receive

29:35.640 --> 29:37.160
because these

29:37.160 --> 29:40.600
Devices are publishing to the topic all the time

29:41.080 --> 29:46.760
They can say my current rgb value is this so home assistant without having to constantly publish

29:46.760 --> 29:49.960
So home assistant without having to constantly poll the device

29:50.680 --> 29:53.800
Is also aware of what's happening on that device just by listening

29:53.960 --> 29:57.960
But like you were saying at the beginning with the amount of integrations that are available now

29:58.520 --> 30:02.600
And a lot of the devices you buy today you can buy with home assistant integration in mind

30:03.160 --> 30:05.320
I actually haven't been compelled to set this up yet

30:05.320 --> 30:11.500
But I I imagine there will be a future some device something I want to do that just simply works better using mqtt

30:11.500 --> 30:17.340
Uh, maybe it's maybe it's a tasmota plug. Maybe it's a shelly something like that

30:17.420 --> 30:20.540
I could see pushing me into using it if you need it, you'll know

30:21.420 --> 30:26.620
Our next question is about dns. Do you want to take this one? Yeah, and uh, this is kind of this is kind of a good

30:26.700 --> 30:33.020
Tie-in because everything on a network always runs a lot better when your dns is in good shape ben writes in and he

30:33.260 --> 30:38.780
He says he listens religiously, but he says we mentioned in our last show about hosting our own dns

30:38.780 --> 30:44.460
I'm wondering what you run and why so, um, I generally will I mentioned it briefly

30:44.460 --> 30:52.540
I'll generally self-host dns on any land that I run anywhere for performance reasons mostly because local dns lookups

30:53.100 --> 30:58.860
That happen over your lan are faster than going out to your isp or even all the way out to google or open dns

30:58.940 --> 31:00.380
It's just a simpler

31:00.380 --> 31:02.940
Straighter shot doesn't even have to go out through a router

31:03.260 --> 31:05.100
So that's one reason is performance

31:05.100 --> 31:09.500
The other aspect of that of course is is everything caches that means that it has a lot of records

31:09.580 --> 31:15.020
So if I go to a lot of the same places on my machines once one machine's gone there. I have those records locally

31:15.500 --> 31:18.540
which also improves performance and

31:19.740 --> 31:24.780
Additionally, I like to be able to resolve all of my uh machines by name if possible

31:25.260 --> 31:29.500
So a lot of times i'll use whatever solution ties and integrates in with dhcp

31:29.580 --> 31:32.540
So that way when the dhcp server issues a lease

31:32.540 --> 31:37.580
It also then dynamically updates my dns server with that new client's

31:38.300 --> 31:39.420
host name

31:39.420 --> 31:41.020
Not all dhcp and dns

31:41.020 --> 31:45.340
So systems do this but if there's like a if there's an option in the land i'm using that's straightforward

31:45.420 --> 31:46.700
I go that route

31:46.700 --> 31:49.100
There's a lot of ways you can do this. Sometimes it's dns mass

31:49.100 --> 31:53.500
Sometimes it's just something built into a router. It sort of depends on the hardware and equipment you're using

31:53.820 --> 31:56.940
I don't have any religious like devotion to bind or

31:56.940 --> 32:04.220
Or anything like that alex. Do you have a specific like dns religion on your lands? I wouldn't go as far as a religion

32:04.380 --> 32:05.820
I mean I I run

32:05.820 --> 32:08.780
Open sense, uh, and I run pf sense for a long time

32:09.500 --> 32:12.540
Open sense uses unbound as its built-in dns server

32:13.180 --> 32:15.260
But to complicate matters, I also run

32:15.900 --> 32:17.340
ad guard home

32:17.340 --> 32:21.020
Which does dns level ad filtering across my entire network

32:21.660 --> 32:25.820
So the way I handle this is my dhcp leases

32:25.820 --> 32:31.740
Is hand out the ip address of the vm that's running ad guard home

32:32.380 --> 32:34.380
ad guard home is then

32:34.460 --> 32:41.500
Asked to forward any queries that it doesn't know the answer to to open sense and then open sense forwards any queries

32:41.580 --> 32:43.500
It doesn't know the answer to

32:43.500 --> 32:44.300
to

32:44.300 --> 32:46.300
Cloudflare or google or whoever

32:46.460 --> 32:52.300
And the reason I have to do that is because i'm running open shift and kubernetes clusters on my lan and I want to configure

32:53.020 --> 32:55.020
the dns overrides in

32:55.020 --> 32:58.400
unbound because they know because the router has the

32:58.960 --> 33:03.840
The firewall has the knowledge of which ip address is belonging to which vm and mac address and that kind of stuff

33:04.320 --> 33:10.160
But I also want the ad blocking capabilities of ad guard as well because mobile browsing is just a dumpster fire without it

33:10.800 --> 33:11.760
so

33:11.760 --> 33:17.600
There's lots of different ways. There's no right or wrong way to skin this particular cat. I actually wrote a blog post

33:18.240 --> 33:20.240
on how to do this with

33:20.320 --> 33:24.480
Unbound and pie hole a little while ago, which i'll put a link to in the show notes

33:24.480 --> 33:30.320
Yeah, and to directly answer your question ben I at home am presently using pie hole and have been

33:30.880 --> 33:37.280
Very happy with it. If you use it as your ghcp server. It also does that handy update of the dynamic dns

33:38.560 --> 33:43.680
Datadog.com slash self hosted today's episode of self hosted is sponsored by datadog

33:43.920 --> 33:50.800
They're the unified monitoring platform that gives you real-time observability and detailed insights into your docker performance as well

33:50.800 --> 33:58.320
Why not enhance your visibility into container orchestration with a live container view and you can easily detect clusters that are consuming excessive

33:58.860 --> 34:06.400
Resources and you get an auto generated map that shows you how everything connects together out of the box datadog collects critical metrics from each

34:06.400 --> 34:12.080
Of your containers so you get immediate visibility into aggregated and even disaggregated service level traffic

34:12.320 --> 34:17.920
This is beautiful insights when you're developing an application or when you need to troubleshoot something and it all gets displayed elegantly

34:17.920 --> 34:21.760

If you're a sys admin or your developer

34:33.200 --> 34:40.240
I think you're going to be really drawn to datadog because it was created initially to solve that problem between communicating between sys admins

34:40.480 --> 34:45.760
And developers but now it's really grown over the years into quite the unified metrics platform

34:45.760 --> 34:51.520
And just a couple of years ago, they rewrote their agent into go that makes it really efficient and easy to get an agent

We may as well call this episode google turning the screw hey, yeah, really? Yeah and google photos

35:10.480 --> 35:16.000
This one hurts because I got sucked into google photos. I tried to divorce google photos

35:16.400 --> 35:19.040
And then I was pulled right back in and I was promised

35:19.600 --> 35:23.040
Free storage forever. Well, don't you still get it because you've got a pixel, right?

35:23.280 --> 35:28.560
Does that only count if you take photos on the pixel because that's probably the phone I use the least these days to take photos

35:30.000 --> 35:34.720
Yeah, nothing really changes for me though alex because I paid for two terabytes of google drive storage

35:35.520 --> 35:38.800
And then they're emailed to me telling me that they're discontinuing the unlimited storage

35:38.800 --> 35:42.320
They said but by our estimations you're gonna have four years before you have to worry about it

35:42.560 --> 35:46.640
And nothing's changing until june the 1st 2021. It's worth saying so

35:47.120 --> 35:50.420
Google photos will end its free unlimited storage

35:50.960 --> 35:52.720
in 2021

35:52.720 --> 35:58.320
And the verge writes that you will have to start paying after you hit the 15 gigabyte cap

35:58.880 --> 36:02.560
Google already counts original quality photo uploads against the storage cap

36:03.040 --> 36:06.880
But by taking away unlimited backup for high quality photos and video

36:06.880 --> 36:13.060
Which by the way are horribly compressed if you've ever gone back and looked at any of those high quality

36:13.520 --> 36:18.960
Pictures they are like youtube bad compressed. They they can be really bad sometimes

36:19.600 --> 36:21.600
But I think they're taking away

36:22.160 --> 36:25.200
One of the service's single biggest selling points, honestly

36:25.360 --> 36:32.000
There is one law that seems to be true on the internet is unlimited storage never lasts never lasts. How can it?

36:32.000 --> 36:33.760
It's not sustainable, is it?

36:33.760 --> 36:37.680
I mean if you think about how much just a single 10 terabyte drive costs you or me

36:38.320 --> 36:42.720
okay, we're not buying it anywhere near the scale google are so they're not paying what we're paying but

36:43.360 --> 36:47.600
I've got three or four terabytes up in the cloud and I expect that to be highly available

36:48.300 --> 36:50.300
replicated across multiple regions and

36:50.720 --> 36:52.160
I mean that's all transparent to me

36:52.160 --> 36:56.080
But these are the assumptions i'm making about what google are doing on the back end with the storage

36:56.480 --> 37:00.080
It's not just one disk that I have to pay for the lifespan of

37:00.080 --> 37:07.200
And so there'll be some people that are using way way way more than that 15 gig. Some people will be using

37:08.460 --> 37:15.200
Terabytes video production studios that kind of stuff. Yeah, I have I have a two terabyte google disk myself

37:15.280 --> 37:18.720
Just for that, you know a little extra space on you know, and I don't want to worry about it for a while

37:19.280 --> 37:21.200
but seeing this news and

37:21.200 --> 37:23.200
Just always kind of staying

37:23.600 --> 37:26.320
Google aware, you know, like you have to stay bear aware when you're in the woods

37:26.320 --> 37:31.920
Well when you're on the internet you have to you need to stay google aware and it has this issue coming up again has reminded

37:31.920 --> 37:36.080
Me that I should probably start planning an exit strategy from google photos

37:36.320 --> 37:36.480
Yeah

37:36.480 --> 37:41.600
But you know in some point in the future you're going to want to just open a photos app and type the word mountain

37:41.840 --> 37:49.200
And just get all the mountain machine learning pictures that they found or let's be real. I want to find pictures of levi really quick

37:49.200 --> 37:55.280
He's a cute dog, I think it would be quicker for you to find pictures that aren't at levi probably

37:56.960 --> 37:58.960
Fair play to you. Yeah, it's very true

37:59.440 --> 38:05.460
That's the holy grail of self-hosting photo managers is can you have search and object recognition?

38:06.160 --> 38:10.960
That's competitive with google photos. That's something we've been asked with the from the audience

38:11.120 --> 38:17.280
It's something we've asked ourselves and it appears that a project called photo prism is promising to deliver just that

38:17.280 --> 38:23.200
Actual object recognition automatically tagged and then available via search in a web ui

38:24.000 --> 38:29.440
Similar but maybe even superior to the google photos web ui and alexander you had a chance to try it out

38:29.680 --> 38:35.360
so it does machine learning based on the tensorflow library and uh, I don't know it's

38:35.920 --> 38:40.240
It's fine. It's it's no google photos, but it's certainly promising

38:40.560 --> 38:43.280
They have a demo available if people want to try it out

38:43.280 --> 38:47.380
I'll see if I can't get that linked in the show notes, but it's demo.photoprism.org

38:48.080 --> 38:52.240
And you could go get a sense of how usable this thing is and it worked

38:52.240 --> 38:56.800
You can search for mountain and it will find all of the pictures of mountain or you can search for dog

38:56.800 --> 38:58.800
And it will find all the pictures of dog

38:58.960 --> 39:04.560
Does this I assume just sit on top of a directory that you have passed through in docker compose?

39:04.800 --> 39:08.800
Yeah, so the first time you add a directory in through docker compose

39:08.800 --> 39:13.920
You have to put it in a very specific place in order for photoprism to pick it up

39:14.480 --> 39:16.160
so

39:16.160 --> 39:18.820
Photoprism expects it to be in slash photoprism

39:19.600 --> 39:21.520
slash originals

39:21.520 --> 39:26.240
And once it's given that path so through a volume by matt in a container

39:26.240 --> 39:28.640
you can obviously make that any host path on your

39:29.840 --> 39:34.020
Pi or whatever else is is running this but you're going to need some horsepower

39:34.020 --> 39:40.020
I've got a dual socket zeon system running my server and i've been importing my

39:40.560 --> 39:42.260
50 000 images

39:42.260 --> 39:48.100
All morning and it's now mid afternoon. We're still going and we're only about 20 of the way through

39:49.220 --> 39:52.180
Wow, it's pegged every single cpu core

39:52.900 --> 39:58.660
So my I have 16 cpu cores passed through to this vm. My load average is at 18

39:59.060 --> 40:02.660
I thought it would be on the gpu to tell you the truth. This is going to take quite a while on the cpu

40:02.660 --> 40:07.460
I don't have a gpu in that system. So maybe that's the problem. Okay, okay, huh?

40:08.260 --> 40:11.940
So you throw a box with a lot of resources at it if you want to try out photoprism

40:12.820 --> 40:16.740
But you know, this is what you're paying google photos for right or what you're paying the storage

40:16.740 --> 40:20.340
You're not even having to pay for this aspect, but you know google's doing something very similar

40:20.820 --> 40:22.820
Of course, they're also collecting the data

40:22.820 --> 40:27.940
What kind of appeals to me about photoprism is it means but in a good way I go back to

40:27.940 --> 40:35.960
To like the early aughts where I self-managed my photo library and I self-organized it in what's called a directory

40:37.300 --> 40:42.100
and and then I just then I just throw something on top of it that does the image recognition and

40:42.900 --> 40:46.820
I'll tell you why i'm kind of burned about the google photos pricing change

40:47.460 --> 40:53.300
Google photos came along and it was really good at the object recognition and the search

40:53.300 --> 40:59.780
But alex, it was not the only game in the town. I was paying for a commercial service

41:00.100 --> 41:02.260
Where this small team of developers who I knew them?

41:02.260 --> 41:09.140
So I was I was comfortable with it. They had created a product that took your photos and created the search index for you

41:09.620 --> 41:13.940
And they were put out of business by google photos because google photos was free

41:14.500 --> 41:20.260
And they could not charge eight dollars a month for what google photos did for free and they had to shut down

41:20.500 --> 41:22.500
And they weren't the only shop that had to do that

41:22.500 --> 41:29.140
So google came along and they dumped their google photos product on the market and then after they killed all of the competition

41:29.220 --> 41:34.740
They're now charging for the storage after telling you you'd have a lifetime of storage. It's the walmart effect, isn't it?

41:34.820 --> 41:37.140
And so that's why I think it is maybe worth

41:37.860 --> 41:43.140
A few steps back in features and functionality. Like I don't think photoprism is going to like automatically generate

41:43.620 --> 41:47.460
Those movies for you and suggest a book for you like google photos does

41:47.460 --> 41:52.980
But it will give you a ui that sits on top of a directory of photos and searches and tags them

41:53.540 --> 41:58.740
And of course your mileage will vary depending on what computational method you use and how many photos are involved

41:59.300 --> 42:05.860
Nice thing is is that we've got both options available to us. One is we pay for it with our privacy and

42:06.500 --> 42:12.340
You know that that kind of thing and the other one is a completely free and open freedom respecting solution

42:12.340 --> 42:20.180
So I really hope that this project continues to improve and i'm going to see if I can contribute to it because photos really is

42:20.180 --> 42:22.180
one of the biggest

42:22.180 --> 42:24.180
pieces of of uh

42:24.180 --> 42:28.820
Our digital lives and um, and it's about you know, it's it's about really capturing your memories

42:29.140 --> 42:35.700
It's about capturing some of the most important moments of your life. So as life goes on you you you value those photos even more

42:35.700 --> 42:40.580
Right, so they become more precious over time not less very true. Yeah, so, you know alex

42:40.580 --> 42:46.660
so, you know alex, I could see a future blog post and then a segment on the show where you or I have combined a

42:47.380 --> 42:50.580
auto backup from our phone to the file server that then

42:51.060 --> 42:56.580
Goes into photoprism that then also does a secure offsite backup. Like I could see a whole photo workflow

42:57.220 --> 42:58.420
future

42:58.420 --> 43:01.220
And so if anybody has any insights if they're doing something like this

43:01.620 --> 43:06.020
Why not start collecting intel from the audience go to self-hosted dot show slash contact

43:06.020 --> 43:10.980
What's really interesting is i'm just watching the the processes in htop running running around

43:11.920 --> 43:13.920
photoprism is

43:13.920 --> 43:20.900
Multi-threaded and it's taking up most of the space but every so often I see dark table cli applying custom presets coming through

43:20.980 --> 43:28.180
So I think it's using other open source software under the hood dark table to render the previews and stuff like that

43:28.260 --> 43:34.580
So it's I think that's pretty cool. That is really cool. That would be a combo. I would use that's so awesome

43:34.580 --> 43:38.500
All right. I think i'm going to try it out. So the only reason I didn't try it before the show

43:39.540 --> 43:45.860
is docker sucks at packaging up for the latest linux distributions and so i'm in this no man's zone right now where

43:46.180 --> 43:50.500
Docker hasn't been officially packaged for the distribution i'm using and it drives me crazy and it's

43:50.820 --> 43:54.340
Actually making me want to switch to podman but that is a topic for another show

43:54.900 --> 43:57.620
that's a hangover from several years ago when uh

43:58.100 --> 44:03.060
Docker changed their semantic versioning to be monthly based instead

44:03.060 --> 44:08.100
And then they decided oh, we're going to create our own yum or apt repos

44:08.420 --> 44:13.620
And then we're going to maintain them except for the fact that new distros come out every six months

44:13.620 --> 44:15.620
And then you need to create a whole new repo

44:16.260 --> 44:21.220
For that distro and it's it's a perennial problem with ubuntu and fedora that uh, yes

44:21.380 --> 44:28.340
They just don't solve and it really annoys me and I thought you know, I could I could use the the distributions packages

44:28.420 --> 44:32.340
But I don't really like doing that. Um, I could swat I could try switching to podman

44:32.340 --> 44:37.700
But I decided you know what? I'm just i'm just gonna wait. I'll just wait, you know, Chris

44:37.940 --> 44:41.220
Have you uh, have you have you heard of this thing called, uh arch?

44:43.940 --> 44:49.060
By the way, alex runs arch it's just not a problem on arch, you know, no, you're right you're right

44:49.140 --> 44:55.640
You're right. You're absolutely right. The funny thing is is I i'm using the distribution of your employer and you're using some hippie distribution

44:57.060 --> 44:59.300
Because i'm on fedora 33 hey now

44:59.300 --> 45:03.860
Hey now my server's ubuntu. My desktop is arch. Yep. My laptop is fedora

45:04.740 --> 45:05.780
so

45:05.780 --> 45:09.540
I don't care. You're not only a multi distro guy. You're a multi os guy

45:09.620 --> 45:13.460
You you really hold no platform allegiance as you just use what's best and that's what I like about you

45:13.700 --> 45:20.100
I I try to uh, I want to mention our sponsor a cloud guru has a python 3 scripting course for system administrators

45:20.180 --> 45:24.020
If you need to develop some skills to write effective and powerful python scripts

45:24.020 --> 45:29.060
A cloud guru has a course that will have you completely covered and beyond just the language itself

45:29.060 --> 45:36.100
You'll go through full development processes including project setup planning and automated testing to build different command line tools

45:36.660 --> 45:38.660
all with python 3

45:38.980 --> 45:40.820
So go check out a cloud guru for that

45:40.820 --> 45:46.020
We have a link in the show notes if you want to go directly to this python 3 scripting for system administrator courses

45:46.660 --> 45:50.100
I think you're gonna like it. So we'll have a link in the show notes over at a cloud guru

45:50.100 --> 45:55.620
It's python 3 scripting for system administrators definitely worth checking out if you're getting in the python game

45:56.420 --> 46:00.660
