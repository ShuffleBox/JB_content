1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
I've been busy making tons and tons of bread this week.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,480
Bread? Really?

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,360
Yeah, bread, like the dough stuff, right?

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,280
You know, flour, water, yeast.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,960
Yeah, okay, how's that going?

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,520
It's good.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:17,440
You know, it's a good way to work out some frustrations needing that dough.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,080
I'll tell you what.

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,920
So are you telling me you've bought into the pandemic craze of making sourdough,

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,440
or is this bread for something else?

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,560
This isn't sourdough.

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,840
I'm not a hipster, bro.

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,360
I refute that allegation.

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,880
Sourdough is delicious.

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,840
It is, yeah.

16
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,400
I tried sourdough last year and failed.

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,560
Pretty spectacular.

18
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,560
I ended up with this soggy lump of what should have been delicious bread,

19
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,160
and it was, I mean, it tasted fine.

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,720
It was just dense AF.

21
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,600
Doesn't sound very good.

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,080
Yeah, I've seen those bad bread experiments.

23
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,280
It's not so good.

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,840
But this stuff, I'm just making standard crusty loaf, and it's all in the kneading.

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,680
It's all in the, you know, working.

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,080
You got to work it, girl, you know?

27
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,000
Sure, sure.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,960
I love to work it.

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,080
And is it sandwich bread?

30
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,360
Is that what you're doing with it?

31
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,800
Yeah, well, we actually went to Trader Joe's for the first time this week.

32
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,560
Do you have Trader Joe's up where you are?

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,360
Sure, we do, yeah.

34
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,680
And we've discovered it's somewhat like, for the British audience,

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,000
it's like a cross between Aldi and Marks and Spencer's food hall.

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,000
There's only own brand products in this shop,

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,120
and we found this thing in there called cookie butter.

38
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,320
It's like peanut butter.

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,800
It's a spread, and it goes on bread.

40
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:38,560
And it's like gingerbread meets Nutella on fresh crusty bread.

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,200
I'm telling you, man, there are few meals that are more delicious than that one.

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,400
Man, you're making me hungry.

43
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,600
Well, if you want to spend your time learning something else,

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,840
maybe you should consider a cloud guru.

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,920
They are the leader in cloud learning, and they have all kinds of modern tech skills,

46
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,480
including Linux that you can learn, hundreds of courses,

47
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,680
thousands of hands-on labs.

48
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,400
Get certified.

49
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,360
Get hired.

50
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,160
Get learning at a cloudguru.com.

51
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,480
Or you could learn bread, too, or maybe both.

52
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,080
You mean this isn't the bread action show.

53
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,880
Is that what you're trying to say?

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,400
I mean, not yet.

55
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,720
It could be.

56
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,480
Now, you just got back from a trip, right?

57
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,440
Welcome back.

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,320
Got back yesterday.

59
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,560
Still a little tired.

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,480
Went all the way to Bozeman, Montana, which is one of our favorite destinations.

61
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,000
Just a beautiful spot.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,800
Had the kids, had the dog, had the wife.

63
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,960
So it was a fully loaded bus.

64
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,200
And it's also, I think, Alex, the first trip since the big Project RV upgrades,

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,960
like all of them, including the internet setup, have all been in place.

66
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,360
Yeah, nice.

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,480
I think the last one I recall you took was down to Texas.

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,600
Yeah.

69
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,040
And we didn't have the internet system then.

70
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,720
We had the solar system at that point, but we did not have the internet.

71
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:44,960
Right.

72
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,160
Your industrial grade carrier busting.

73
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,200
How did that work out?

74
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,720
Well, you know, I'm pretty happy.

75
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,360
I'm pretty happy.

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,800
I mean, so the main goal when I'm traveling with the whole family

77
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,480
is to have my self-hosted system in my RV just be like out of the mind,

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,680
out of the picture, no hassle, just I call it out of the way automation

79
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,840
because it's like facilitating the entire trip,

80
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,320
but I don't want to be managing it during the trip.

81
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,200
It's like hygiene.

82
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,640
You shouldn't have to think about it.

83
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,600
The minute you're thinking about someone else's hygiene,

84
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,520
like you know they need to step it up a bit.

85
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,080
And it definitely, the setup passed that bar.

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,800
It was pretty seamless, really.

87
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,320
I had reception in areas that I've never had reception before.

88
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,200
And the whole thing is like, I want the whole land to be really solid

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,120
because the kids are streaming videos off of a Raspberry Pi

90
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,840
or they're playing peer-to-peer networking games.

91
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,680
And I want that connection to remain up

92
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,320
regardless of what the cellular connection is doing.

93
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,760
So I've sort of separated it all out.

94
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,320
I have Wi-Fi access points and I have a router and I keep that all separated

95
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,480
so that way the router could even be offline theoretically.

96
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,640
Because there are times, legitimately,

97
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,480
while we're driving through the Cascade Mountains

98
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,440
or we're going through passes that we just don't have signal.

99
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,680
There's just nobody has a cell tower on the mountain.

100
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,320
So we want stuff to work.

101
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,520
And then when we get back into connectivity,

102
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,560
whichever cellular provider is available and we have three on board,

103
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,920
I want that one to pick up and just start working.

104
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,720
That blew my mind the first time we took a trip in the Southwest

105
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,680
in the deserts around like Utah and stuff is,

106
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,400
we went sometimes an entire workday without any coverage.

107
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,120
Yeah.

108
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,000
Crazy.

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yeah, it is really,

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,560
Washington has gotten really good about it, my home state.

111
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,400
We have got towers everywhere except for the tops of the passes.

112
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,280
But there are absolutely parts of Montana

113
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,320
where there's just no signal we were at and same in Texas still.

114
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,080
So what I have for my technology stuff,

115
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,920
because I wanted all the work really smooth

116
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
and I just want it to be a really good experience

117
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,440
and it's really when I just need it to be the most hassle-free.

118
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,160
So I kind of have a regime before I go into a trip

119
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
and I have these windows of time.

120
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,760
And this is just something where it's for the entire RV,

121
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,000
but the technology stack is part of this.

122
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,720
And the first one is what I call my T48 window.

123
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,200
And that's 48 hours before a trip.

124
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,200
In this T48 window, major changes are allowed to the technology stack.

125
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,360
Like I did an Ubuntu 2104 update to get all the security fixes in.

126
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
I installed the latest Home Assistant upgrade.

127
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,720
And if I'm going to remove a node from the network

128
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,640
or add something to the network,

129
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,160
this T48 window is my last chance, 48 hours before we leave.

130
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,560
That's my last chance to make a major change like that.

131
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,880
It's also when I'll take snapshots of Home Assistant and my boxes

132
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,200
and make sure my backups are offsite.

133
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,360
It's a window of time to kind of just do a sanity check on all of my,

134
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,360
what if I lose the devices?

135
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,640
What if there's something that causes me to completely lose the storage

136
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,760
or something like that?

137
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,360
Do I have something in place just to make sure before I go?

138
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,440
You know, it's so great about everything you've just said.

139
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,760
I think you actually have more pre-flight checks

140
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,840
than some customers of mine do deploying stuff into production.

141
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,480
Well, I recently kind of decided to really treat these trips

142
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,440
as kind of an operational thing.

143
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,520
And that goes into like finding gas stations that we can fit in

144
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,560
and the best routes to take and trying to identify weather conditions

145
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,200
and construction and these concepts of a T48 checklist,

146
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,320
we expand that too to like making sure we have propane available,

147
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,240
double checking reservations.

148
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,560
Like it's a lot outside of just the tech stack.

149
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,120
And you know, we also will use this window of time

150
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,600
to make a go or no go call possibly on the trip.

151
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,280
Maybe something came up.

152
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,800
Like this last trip, we had something come up and we're like,

153
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,960
well, we should have added that to the T48 checklist.

154
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,280
And now that's part of what we're going to do from now on.

155
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,640
Oh, hold on, hold on, your checklist has a name?

156
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,560
Yeah, T48. Yeah, yeah.

157
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,280
That's not just it.

158
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,480
We have it's yeah, because that's T minus 48 hours until leaving.

159
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:46,720
Yeah.

160
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,400
Oh, okay.

161
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,520
I like it.

162
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,920
And then we also have the T24 window.

163
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,480
Now that's the last like crunch time.

164
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,640
That's 24 hours before the trip.

165
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,960
That's when I break down my home office set up quote unquote in the RV.

166
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,200
So I no longer have a PC set up.

167
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,880
So I mostly transitioned to using my iPad for most of my work

168
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,800
or if I have to allow, I'll break out my laptop.

169
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,680
And this is where the change control committee AKA myself says no more big changes.

170
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,000
Just stop with your crazy updates.

171
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,520
I don't care.

172
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,640
I love this so much.

173
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,640
I can't even, oh, this is so good.

174
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,360
It works though.

175
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,600
It's like, and I've been in that window before.

176
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,680
I'm like, oh, I didn't install the home assistant update.

177
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,480
I'm probably going to be too behind by the time I'm on the road trip.

178
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,200
I should do it right before I leave because I'm going to be in a limited

179
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,600
or maybe no bandwidth situation on the road.

180
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,040
But when I'm in that T24 window, no, no major changes

181
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,440
because I don't want to do anything that's going to break

182
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,160
and cause me to go on a big project right before we leave.

183
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,560
Right.

184
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,760
That's what we call in the biz a change freeze window.

185
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,160
Yep.

186
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,480
Yep.

187
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,400
And that is an effect on once the T24 window is in effect.

188
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,920
But you know what I will do during this time is I will manage the media for the trip.

189
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,640
This is part of happy family, happy life where I go through because I have only

190
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,120
two terabytes of media storage in the RV.

191
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,480
So I go through and I purge old movies and shows that we're not watching anymore.

192
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,040
And then I kind of load in the fresh stuff because I want content that the kids can watch

193
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,600
while we're going down the road that I know is kid friendly and will also keep them occupied.

194
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,800
So little tip for you dads out there, what I start doing or you moms is I start collecting

195
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,320
a show for them like weeks before the trip and I don't tell them about it.

196
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,800
And I get it all organized like on an external hard drive.

197
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,640
And then I load it on the Plex server in this T24 window and then I tell Plex to immediately

198
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,840
index and do its thing.

199
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,280
So that way when we set off for the trip, all of a sudden they've just got new content

200
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,840
on Plex.

201
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,560
Oh, look at this.

202
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,360
It's great.

203
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,960
And then something else I'll do is I'll look for like a movie or a trilogy.

204
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,480
That's what I've been doing is finding family trilogies and loading them on there as well.

205
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,480
So while we're on the road, maybe we're at a rest stop for a night or we're at some site

206
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,880
where it's really bad weather and the kids are kind of stuck in the RV, we've got movies

207
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,280
to watch.

208
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,960
Like this year I brought Jurassic Park.

209
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,480
Last year I brought Back to the Future.

210
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,440
I love the trilogies.

211
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,520
Who doesn't love a bit of Jeff Goldblum, eh?

212
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,000
Right.

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,120
Oh, my gosh.

214
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,560
I have not watched Jurassic Park in like forever.

215
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,440
And boy, Jeff Goldblum is laying it on thick in that movie.

216
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,880
It's thicker than my cookie butter on fresh bread.

217
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,760
No doubt about it.

218
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,440
So, you know, they get all that stuff sorted in my 24 hour window.

219
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,680
Verify that my LTE networks are all active, that one of my crazy carriers hasn't like

220
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,920
canceled my account for some random reason.

221
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,680
I'll even reboot my router often just to make sure that comes up fresh and nice and snappy.

222
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,520
And then we set off.

223
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,280
And that's kind of my process every time.

224
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,440
And it forces me to go through and verify my backups, kind of forces me to do updates

225
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,000
and figure out what needs updated and what I couldn't do.

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,480
And kind of makes me think about what do I need that I can store offline so that way

227
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,880
when we don't have connectivity, life goes on as usual.

228
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,480
And I think it worked really well.

229
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,000
You know, this kind of trip to Montana was one of my use cases in my mind for this whole

230
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,800
project off grid.

231
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,000
That's awesome, man.

232
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,160
Like last time you were trying to solve some issues around, was it the various voice tubes,

233
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,480
the voice assistants and their GPS locations and stuff with them freaking out.

234
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,680
How was that this time?

235
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,760
So the HomePod does all right because it goes often, not always, but by the location of

236
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,360
like the primary phone that set it up.

237
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,400
But the other stuff is really dumb about it.

238
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,640
And so what we just use the other stuff as is reference for what it's like back at home.

239
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,880
So when we ask for weather or we see the clock on there, we know that's what time at home

240
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,000
is or what weather is at home.

241
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,600
And that's just, you know, what really, I think, solved that problem for me was when

242
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,040
I put up the fire tablets that have the Home Assistant dashboard up all the time and the

243
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,160
family can just, they kind of just prefer to do that anyways.

244
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,640
And then I still kind of use the tubes.

245
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,960
But you made a point the other day on Linux Unplugged.

246
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,040
There's actually a great interview on there.

247
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,800
And we were torn about whether to use that interview in this show or LUP.

248
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,760
And we ended up using it in LUP in the end with Aaron about his converted school bus.

249
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,920
Yeah, really cool project.

250
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,640
You know, and Alex, he's taken to the next level.

251
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,320
I'm still not there yet where I'm not pulling all of the metrics out of my electrical system

252
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,200
and putting it into Home Assistant, but he's done it.

253
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,800
He's done it with some raspberry pies and a little box that Victron makes called the Venus.

254
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,960
And he gets all that information in there.

255
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,280
And I love that idea.

256
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,760
And then what I want to do is kind of gamify it a little bit.

257
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,680
And I saw another post recently from a dad who took Home Assistant and put family chores

258
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,360
in there and the family checks off the chores via the Home Assistant Lovelace dashboard.

259
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,640
And it generates points.

260
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,360
You saw that?

261
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,320
I saw that one, yeah.

262
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,200
It's such a great way.

263
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,520
I'd love to do that, but with power to kind of encourage and incentivize the family to

264
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,600
conserve power, although on this trip, Alex, legitimately, the solar system was totally

265
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,080
enough.

266
00:11:54,080 --> 00:12:00,320
I was worried that 600 amp hours of lithium would not be enough power for a full family.

267
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,920
But when you get some good solar coming in, like we had on this trip, we had good solar

268
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,000
every day, and you're doing just a little bit of driving so you also charge from the

269
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,840
alternator, I'm not exaggerating when I say we had unlimited power.

270
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:18,240
We had more power than we could use for the nearly two weeks.

271
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,440
We just lived life as if we were hooked up to the grid, and I never had to tell the kids

272
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,600
turn off the lights or don't turn that TV on.

273
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,160
I do still struggle with some overheating problems.

274
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,240
I had my power system overheat once when it was pretty hot out and we were really pushing

275
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,520
it, and I was really trying to see how hard I could push the system in general.

276
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,640
And it did like a safety shut down on me and turned off the power to everything.

277
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,280
Harder everything, including the servers.

278
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,040
Well, I mean, if you're doing a life hack where you're using the sun to power your air

279
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,680
conditioner to cool you down as well as, you know, running a toaster or whatever else you're

280
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,080
doing.

281
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,680
Yeah, it's a bit of a it's a bit of one of those situations where when you have that

282
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,200
much sun, it creates enough heat that you need to run the air conditioning and you end

283
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,560
up trying to balance it all out.

284
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,400
And I was really pushing it.

285
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,840
Oh, and we'd been driving.

286
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,080
And of course, the drivetrain itself gets hot.

287
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,240
So where our power bay is at, you know, there's heat from the drivetrain to adding to this

288
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,640
whole thing.

289
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,400
So, yeah, I'm very happy with it.

290
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,640
I do have to seriously figure out cooling, but it just is going to involve major cutting

291
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,680
into the side of my RV.

292
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,280
And I just don't want to do that.

293
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,160
But one day and I need to get that data into home assistant.

294
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,760
I've got to get that figured out as well.

295
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,840
And then ultimately, Alex, I would love to be managing this entire thing with some system

296
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,200
that allows me to redeploy everything from scratch.

297
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,440
So if a Raspberry Pi died from heat or everything died and I had to pop in new units when I'm

298
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,160
on the road, it would be a minimal amount of downtime and just totally be able to redeploy

299
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,080
my infrastructure from one central point.

300
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,360
And I know that's something we want to talk about today, but it's been on my mind because

301
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,840
that seems like the next level I could take this set up to to make it even more trouble

302
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,160
free.

303
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,480
And when there is a problem, a couple of Raspberry Pis in the drawer, I pop them in

304
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,440
and I run some sort of system and they're back up and running.

305
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,880
OK, I'm out 45 minutes.

306
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,400
That's that's where I want to take it next.

307
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:10,080
So data from the power system, figuring out cooling and doing some kind of infrastructure

308
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,200
as code set up are my next goals for Project Off Grid.

309
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,320
I love your optimism that you've only got a couple of pies in the drawer.

310
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,840
And I should probably have a switch and maybe a whole other router because that stuff gets

311
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,240
hot.

312
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:22,960
Power supplies.

313
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,000
Don't forget those.

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,400
Yes.

315
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,360
Yeah.

316
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,480
Everything the stuff in the in the in the telco cupboard.

317
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,520
How's the bench seat?

318
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,160
It gets hot.

319
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,200
It gets really hot.

320
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,600
The bench seats also getting hot, but less equipment in there.

321
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,560
It's better now as I've moved, as I've dispersed stuff.

322
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,200
Now that I have power over Ethernet, I've kind of spread stuff out.

323
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,520
Yes.

324
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,840
So the thermal load is not as bad, but it's still not where it's still need.

325
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,880
It still needs a solution.

326
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,680
I'm still not happy.

327
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,520
POE is just so awesome.

328
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,800
I was putting a TV on the wall in my kitchen the other day and I've got one of these Unify

329
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,640
units that's powered over Ethernet and on the bottom, it's got a couple of Ethernet

330
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,760
jacks on the bottom.

331
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,480
And so rather than running a whole second Ethernet cable from wherever in the house,

332
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,040
which would have been a good couple of hundred feet's worth of cable, I just plugged one

333
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,360
tiny little right angle jack into the bottom of this Unify thing, fed it up through the

334
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,680
drywall and out behind the TV just above it.

335
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,600
And it was so easy.

336
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:17,760
Yeah.

337
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,440
Those are the kinds of solutions that feel like like life hacks because you just saved

338
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,320
yourself an hour or two running cable.

339
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,280
And who enjoys fishing cables through walls, man?

340
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,400
And crawl spaces.

341
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,960
Not me.

342
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,080
I'll tell you that.

343
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,240
Linode.com slash SSH.

344
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,120
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit towards a new account and go there to support the

345
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,680
show.

346
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,760
Linode.com slash SSH.

347
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,520
Linode is our cloud server provider.

348
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,400
And really, it's not just because the price is so great, although it is great.

349
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,560
It's also because the tools they have make it possible for a small team to have killer

350
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,680
infrastructure.

351
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,840
Alex and I use it for our projects here on the show.

352
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,880
We use it for the back end infrastructure for JB 3.0 and millions of projects and sites

353
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,360
that we all love on the Internet are using Linode.

354
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,600
They've been around since 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing, three

355
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,240
years before AWS and other enterprise providers.

356
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,360
They're independently owned and founded on a love for Linux and open source.

357
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,360
I mean, they like to geek around with this stuff.

358
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,800
That's why they started so long ago.

359
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,080
Now that we live in the future, they're dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

360
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,280
If it runs on Linux, well, it'll run on Linode.

361
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,760
And they have node balancers and, of course, a fantastic dashboard to make it all possible.

362
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,560
Eleven data centers around the world, one click deployments of the entire application

363
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,200
stack, if that's how you roll or build the whole thing up from scratch.

364
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:42,240
And if you like to manage it with some centralized tools like Terraform, they support that, too.

365
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,160
And then just kind of like the bow on top of it all, they have fantastic 24 seven customer

366
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,400
support by phone or by ticket.

367
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,200
So you're going to be taken care of if you ever run into any problems.

368
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,320
Go see why a huge part of our community has started using Linode and why we use it ourselves.

369
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,400
Linode.com slash SSH.

370
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,560
Now, you know, I have a bit of a thing about

371
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,680
GUIs and I prefer to do things on the command line, don't you?

372
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,120
That is totally true.

373
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,280
The one exception to this rule for probably seven or eight years has been my firewall

374
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,320
for some reason.

375
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,480
I've allowed myself to run PFSense and then I moved to OpenSense last year.

376
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,360
You know, I've thought about that and I've meant to ask you why that is.

377
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,320
I don't know.

378
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,520
It's not rational.

379
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
Maybe it's you always do something that way.

380
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,600
And so you go on doing it that way, perhaps.

381
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,480
Yeah, that must be it.

382
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,800
Like and I came to the conclusion that with my home lab set up where I'm spinning up and

383
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,800
down OpenShift stuff all the time and I'm constantly adding Mac address reservations

384
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,960
for new smart devices that arrive, you know, I get a new phone or a new Shelly device pops

385
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,160
up or whatever it is.

386
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,880
I feel like I'm logging into OpenSense three or four times a week to make some small tweak

387
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,360
for some reason.

388
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,680
Now, that's fine if you, you know, think about it.

389
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,880
It's not really that big of a deal, but I would prefer to just make one config line

390
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,040
change in an Ansible repo or something and then run a playbook and it's done.

391
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:14,080
So I finally bitten the bullet and written a playbook to turn an old Raspberry Pi 3B

392
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,480
plus that I have into my DNS and DHCP server.

393
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,000
Very nice.

394
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,160
And you think a Raspberry, I mean, yeah, it should be powerful enough for what you've

395
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,480
got.

396
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,560
How many devices on your network would you say?

397
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:33,760
I think I've got like 150 or so, but I mean, it's not like, you know, the performance

398
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,600
of a DHCP server, this is ancient history technology, you know, that those servers have

399
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,240
been around as long as the internet has pretty much those technologies and they need such

400
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,760
minimal resources.

401
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,880
The only thing I was worried about with the Raspberry Pi using that for DHCP and DNS was

402
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,400
it's a Pi, right?

403
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,840
I mean, it's logging to an SD card, but then I can just USB boot and put logs into RAM

404
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,280
and ship them off to some remote server if I really want to keep them.

405
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,520
So I think I can work around that.

406
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:12,080
But what I ended up doing was using this as an exercise to remind myself how much I enjoy

407
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,880
writing code.

408
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,920
It's not something I do as much as I would like anymore.

409
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:24,080
And one of the most difficult challenges I found actually was making Ansible look at

410
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,320
a list of Mac addresses that I'd supplied and check for any duplicates.

411
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,880
I mean, it sounds like a really simple thing and, you know, probably to some people it

412
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,400
is, but to me, I felt like I was working on the DaVinci code solving this one.

413
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:45,680
I have one big list of dictionaries with multiple sub keys and sub elements within them,

414
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,080
right?

415
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,280
So it's, you know, name, IP and Mac address, for example, which corresponds to a specific

416
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,600
device or a specific host on my network.

417
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,440
So I can go in and iterate over those keys using Ansible, over those sub elements using

418
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,560
Ansible, and pull out the bits of information that I need to generate the config files,

419
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,600
which then get deployed onto the Raspberry Pi using Ansible.

420
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:17,360
But what was really difficult was actually trying to control the flow of variables using

421
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,800
facts using Ansible.

422
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,840
And there's a code snippet in the show notes if you're interested.

423
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,240
But what I ended up doing was reading the list of Mac addresses into a fact and then

424
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,840
comparing it against itself to be unique using one of Ansible's built-in filters.

425
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:40,240
And I'm sure very few people listening to this are going to ever want to solve the problem

426
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,400
that I solved, but I'm incredibly proud of this bit of code.

427
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,520
So I thought I'd talk about it on the show.

428
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,960
That's a nice solution.

429
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,560
And kind of just works towards what I was talking about, how, in a way, what you've

430
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,280
done is you've let the computer solve a problem for you that I would just spend human

431
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,480
hours burning.

432
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:07,840
I spent probably two evenings whilst I was rocking a baby to sleep in one hand and trying

433
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,720
to code in the other.

434
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,920
Productive right there.

435
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,080
Solving this problem, yeah.

436
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,880
Those late nights are productive for some reason.

437
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,680
What was really interesting, actually, was for my testing, I ended up using my ESXi lab

438
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:27,760
and I created a second virtual network interface on that system.

439
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:34,480
And then I span up an isolated network within my network to test DHCP, because obviously

440
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,720
I didn't want to turn off my primary DHCP server because, well, I kind of need that

441
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,760
for everything that goes on most days.

442
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,680
So I ended up with a completely separate subnet within VMware that I was able to test it and

443
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:55,600
I was able to have OpenSense actually running as a firewall on this virtual network running

444
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,560
within VMware.

445
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,920
It was really cool.

446
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,440
And I really think that if you're remotely interested in networking, that there are just

447
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,360
little projects like this you can do to kind of stretch yourself and challenge yourself,

448
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,840
where you can learn little bits and bobs here and there.

449
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,400
And I don't know, I just had fun doing it.

450
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,720
Yeah, push yourself in a way that it solves a problem and you learn something.

451
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,520
And that solving a problem, something that's been on your mind for a while, is such a good

452
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,000
motivator.

453
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,440
It's such a great way to get into something or in your case, maybe take something to the

454
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,480
next level.

455
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,640
People ask all the time, like, where should I get started?

456
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,600
How should I get started?

457
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,840
That's how, it's a cliche to say it, but scratch that itch.

458
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,280
Absolutely true.

459
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,720
Now, speaking of, we've been using something called Slexi on JB for many, many years.

460
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,960
This goes back to Linux Action Show days.

461
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,480
Excuse me?

462
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,280
Yeah, it does, yeah.

463
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,720
It's a bad name, Slexi.org, but it was a good tool.

464
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,400
Yeah, dude, you old, you know?

465
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,600
Yeah, I know.

466
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,880
I know, and I could see the signs coming because every now and then the service would be offline

467
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,080
for a couple of hours.

468
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,400
And then it came back strong for a bit.

469
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,640
It was just a clean pastebin that supported basically every language on the planet, including

470
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,000
my beloved Markdown even.

471
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,840
And it was really simple for us as a team to take emails that come in or messages on

472
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,240
Discord and throw them in something that we could link the other hosts to and link them

473
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,360
in our show notes.

474
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,160
And it really wasn't something that was necessarily intended for public consumption, although

475
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,680
it could be in some cases.

476
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,560
But it was mostly just so that way you have 15 different platforms, messages come in for

477
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,400
a show, and we could take them and have one central spot.

478
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,760
And so it was Slexi.org.

479
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,480
And then, like so many things, when the cloud giveth, the cloud taketh.

480
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,760
And at the beginning of March, they announced they were shutting down.

481
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:54,240
And I was beside myself, Alex, and I looked over to you, Alex, and I said, Alex, save

482
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,720
us.

483
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,800
This is clearly something we should self-host.

484
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,600
Well, I think we might have found a solution in a project called XBin, and this is over

485
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,360
on GitHub at midnight slash XBin, midnight spelt with a one instead of an I.

486
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,920
Just look in the show notes, there'll be a link there for you.

487
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,160
And this project is actually really interesting.

488
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,960
It's a very simple interface, which is, you know, what Chris needs after a late night,

489
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,000
let's be honest.

490
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,280
Yeah, and it just, boom, pops right up and there's a text field, just paste the stuff

491
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,040
in there, pow, it's good, it's really quick.

492
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,800
And I've actually been working with the developer.

493
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,760
I've opened probably more issues than I should have on his GitHub, and he's been honestly

494
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,760
fantastic. He's added, just for us on our request, custom logo support, the ability

495
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,680
to moderate comments, as well as a couple of other things as well.

496
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,800
That's neat.

497
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:50,160
Yeah, you know, sometimes you just love open source so much that some random guy who I

498
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,560
will probably never meet in person is willing to put some time and effort in to help us

499
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,120
adopt his thing by adding features that we asked for.

500
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,880
It's just so cool.

501
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
It really is great to see.

502
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,360
It's actually so hard to overstate the point you just made.

503
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,440
There is an internal tool that we use as a team to produce our shows, and you contact

504
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,240
the developer, or developers, and they're actually going to implement those features.

505
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,560
Think about that in the context of, say, like subscription enterprise software.

506
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,720
You could be paying thousands of dollars a year and not get that kind of service level.

507
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,040
And it's MIT licensed, so it's, you know, it's a really permissible license.

508
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,720
And I just think it's super wonderful to see it.

509
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,880
Do we have a demo for folks so they can check it out?

510
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,520
We do, yes.

511
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,400
We're actually using it for all of our feedback for this episode.

512
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,360
So at paste.docs.lol, that's now the Jupiter broadcasting paste bin.

513
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,840
We're going to just use it for show notes and, well, not show notes, feedback into shows

514
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,560
and stuff like that.

515
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,840
So I think we're already using it on Coder, but you'll see it in other shows as we go

516
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,880
forward.

517
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,800
There is an actual official project demo linked in the show notes as well.

518
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,280
It's really just a nice, easy to use paste bin clone with some great features.

519
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,280
It's written in Phoenix and Elixir.

520
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,840
And I think one of the things that's appealing to us is it's pretty easy and straightforward

521
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,640
to self-host it.

522
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,400
Now, have you seen the stats page that it has?

523
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,800
So if you go to URL of your instance slash stats, you can see how many public snippets

524
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,200
have been made and, you know, the number of views they're getting, the most popular one,

525
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,000
all that kind of stuff.

526
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,600
I mean, kind of pointless, but also who doesn't love a good graph anyway?

527
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,200
Who doesn't love a good graph, eh?

528
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,200
If you want to see ours, you can go to paste.docs.lol and then it's slash stats, like Alex said.

529
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,760
So we've had 11 public snippets.

530
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,040
I make most of mine public.

531
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,480
So we've done, I guess, 11 emails on this thing so far.

532
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,560
It's interesting that what qualifies as popular is eight people viewed one of them, which

533
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,360
is really just us.

534
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,720
That's just the people in JB.

535
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,280
But, you know, it's great that it shows that.

536
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,960
It runs in Docker, of course.

537
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,000
I wouldn't honestly have looked at it if it didn't.

538
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,840
I'm running it up on a Linode.

539
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,200
I think it's up to about 15 containers, that single $5 Linode now.

540
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,320
Hard to overstate how awesome that is really.

541
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,640
Yeah.

542
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,320
So please be nice to it and don't break it because it's a tool we use for daily production

543
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,600
and we're opening the Komodo a little bit telling you about it.

544
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,080
And now in a feature that I think may well be aimed exclusively at Wes Payne, you can

545
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,200
actually use Netcat to pipe text to Xbin.

546
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,880
When I saw that, I was like, this is so for Wes.

547
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,760
This is so great.

548
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,520
But it's actually just a very quick way.

549
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,200
And if you're already on the command line, the fact that you could Netcat something to

550
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,680
your pastebin, your self-hosted pastebin solution, that's a winning feature.

551
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,240
I'm sorry.

552
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,960
That's great.

553
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,160
Now, I know we use HedgeDock for all of our show notes and stuff in our internal collaboration,

554
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,320
but Xbin also has a synced text mode.

555
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,440
So, you know, if you click on, in the UI, there's a button that says synced, it will

556
00:27:53,440 --> 00:28:00,480
give you a five digit custom code in the URL you give to whoever you want to, you know,

557
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,360
watch in real time, what you're doing, you know, and I can just type away and in real

558
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,160
time, it will update whoever is looking at that URL, what I'm doing, which for like pair

559
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,360
programming or something like that, I can see this being absolutely awesome.

560
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:22,080
ProvadoVPN.com slash SSH PR VA DO VPN.com slash SSH.

561
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,840
Go there and try out Provado for free and support the show.

562
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,800
ProvadoVPN is a zero log VPN.

563
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,280
That means no records of your online activity are logged when connected to ProvadoVPN.

564
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,440
Even in the event of a legitimate authority request for logs associated with your activity

565
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,160
when connected to the service, there's just nothing to give and if that wasn't good enough,

566
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,520
you can rest comfortable knowing they're protected by Swiss privacy laws.

567
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,800
They have a strict zero log policy and they're based in Switzerland.

568
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,600
That really mattered to us and that's why we picked ProvadoVPN for our sponsor.

569
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,240
It means you're protected by the absolute strongest consumer privacy laws in the world

570
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,280
and they have a fantastic network to back it all up.

571
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,000
ProvadoVPN owns and operates its own data centers and fiber lines and the network is

572
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,920
composed of hundreds of servers physically located in 45 countries and 58 cities around the world.

573
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,800
You can connect anywhere in seconds and no matter what server you choose,

574
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,760
you'll get incredibly fast speeds every time you connect.

575
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,760
ProvadoVPN's network was built from the ground up, fully optimized for lightning fast speeds.

584
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,840
We've got some feedback from Kevin in Belgium.

585
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,680
Love the show, guys. Keep it up.

586
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,920
In the last episode, there was some talk about pooling different bits of storage over the network.

587
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,280
In the past, I've used GrayHole to do this.

588
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,480
I was able to pool two different machines into one virtual storage presented via Samba.

589
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,400
Brackets. Yes, I know.

590
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,400
It worked for me for many years until I switched to one new machine,

591
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,200
pooling all drives using merger FS using the...

592
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,280
I don't wish to blow my own trumpet here, but the now famous perfect media server guide.

593
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,280
Yeah, it is. People love that. It's a great guy.

594
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,240
So I took a look at GrayHole. It's actually a pretty interesting project.

595
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,480
And yeah, pooling different bits of storage using Samba.

596
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,880
I mean, that's it. That's the pitch for the product.

597
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,440
I wonder what you think of this, Alex, compared to just something like merger FS with a Samba share on top,

598
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:58,800
because ultimately you get similar results, but the difference with GrayHole is it's taking care of the network layer for you.

599
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,680
And also the sort of the organization via the web UI, if you want,

600
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,440
which I know triggers you sometimes, but it does have a web UI, if you want.

601
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,000
I love a good UI. What are we talking about? I love that.

602
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,800
OK, all right, fine, fine. You won't engage, but I know, I know.

603
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,760
So GrayHole, think of it as a way to pool a bunch of shares.

604
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,960
A way to pool a bunch of shares across your network into one big share, right?

605
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,720
And that's sort of a fair summary of it.

606
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,120
Yeah, pretty much. And the underlying shares, it's a bit like Gluster FS in this regard.

607
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,320
So you've got different effectively bricks of storage,

608
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:41,040
which you then concatenate together into one mega Tron of storage.

609
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:49,040
Yeah, nice feature is that you can set redundancy on a per share level so you can indicate how many copies of each file you want to keep as well,

610
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:54,480
which, you know, if you've only got one copy of something, you may as well have zero copies of it.

611
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,120
I know this is popular with the audience because we got several emails about it as the recommendation

612
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,720
when I put out the question of how are you how are you pooling your storage?

613
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,920
I have to say, overall, it's a solution that feels kind of like an old school approach,

614
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,080
and it has been around forever, so that might be part of it.

615
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,920
But I'll give you an example like to get it up and going via their docs.

616
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,160
You start by curling a shell script and then, you know, pseudo bashing that.

617
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,240
You could do it manually, but either way, you end up just stalling a ton of stuff on your box.

618
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,040
It really does.

619
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,360
And that's just the thing I don't really enjoy anymore.

620
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:33,280
And then there's quite a bit of configuration to essentially build up a whole system based on Finicky Samba shares,

621
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,760
which I again totally appreciate and think there is a spot for that.

622
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,760
And I could even see it like if I was in if I was in like a condo with a couple of roommates like I was,

623
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,160
you know, 20 years ago, I could definitely see us using each of our PCs in a system like this.

624
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,240
And it worked really well for what we want.

625
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,040
But I just don't really see it today.

626
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,200
The way this setup works, Alex, it just doesn't seem doesn't quite seem like it's it.

627
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,880
Like, it's not quite the solution I was looking for.

628
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,320
So when I tried it, I that was my that was my impression.

629
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,160
We also had some feedback coming from Greg, also recommending Gray Hole.

630
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,240
And his point was that each drive is a standalone file system.

631
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,520
So losing just one drive doesn't affect the data on the others, which is useful.

632
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:22,640
But I don't know, to me, this is I know you asked the audience to send in their opinions,

633
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,560
but it feels to me like this is a solution looking for a problem.

634
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,600
And then people have kind of built some reliance on it.

635
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,400
And it's kind of it's a Jeff Goldblum moment, right?

636
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,400
Just just because we can your scientists were so obsessed with whether they could.

637
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,240
They didn't stop to think about whether they should.

638
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,000
Right. And I think that's it.

639
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,120
I think that's my impression of it.

640
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,760
But I do like I do like hearing how it works for people.

641
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,160
And we did get several people that said it works well for them.

642
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,280
And that's kind of awesome because I know Gray Hole's been around for a long time.

643
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,520
And I'm glad to see it's still going.

644
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,680
The Web UI does make it simple to get up and going.

645
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,400
You can go in there.

646
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,400
The first thing you do is you add some storage to it and then it lets you get things set up.

647
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,840
And and that's nice.

648
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,040
That's good to see it.

649
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,560
But I don't know, I guess this sounds really dumb when I go to say it out loud.

650
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,960
But you know what I'd really like is I'd love a solution at the ZFS level where there was

651
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,400
some kind of service where you could you could dedicate any partition formatted in ZFS or any

652
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,800
dedicated to ZFS could become part of some sort of network ZFS pool.

653
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,640
That's where I'd love to see that work get done.

654
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,360
That would be nice.

655
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:27,040
Yeah. The tricky part of this, I think, is you don't know what OS the remote system is running.

656
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,560
And with ZFS in particular, licensing is so such a touchy subject.

657
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:37,520
Whether you could actually have ZFS running as some kind of a container on that remote system

658
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,360
and then say, here's a hundred gig, you know, virtual disk, a bit like Docker desktop works like.

659
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,200
Maybe that's the way to do it.

660
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,560
All right. Well, Rob writes in and Rob's been been using quite a few containers recently

661
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,440
and been running with like 50 terabytes of content.

662
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,880
And while that's been fine for Rob, he kind of wants to take things to the next level.

663
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:01,360
And he says, so do you have any advice or resources for folks out there like me who

664
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:05,680
maybe know just enough to be dangerous, but don't actually know how things are working

665
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,880
under the hood of Unraid? Like, do you have a beginner's guide for folks who maybe know just a bit,

666
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,520
but not as much as they could or really should yet? Thanks for the help, Rob.

667
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,840
Well, I think Rob, you're exactly the type of person I had in mind when we were founding Linux server.io.

668
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:27,680
You know, it's all about finding some good sources of documentation.

669
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,640
And I think something like perfectmediaserver.com may well be a good place to start

670
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,240
if you're looking to build your own box.

671
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,440
But websites like linuxserver.io, as well as there's a few other things like the self-hosted wiki,

672
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,160
self-hosted subreddit, but this is the magic of containers, right?

673
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,400
They allow you to walk before you can run.

674
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,400
And I think that is a huge tick in the pro column for containers.

675
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,480
Back in the day, I think a lot of people kind of gate kept Linux because they were like,

676
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:02,480
well, you need to, you know, have your neckbeard badge to be able to do this particular thing on Linux

677
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,680
and install these 59 packages in a specific order and then recite some incantations to do as, you know,

678
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,600
just to get a simple Samba server going.

679
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:18,080
Whereas nowadays, you can just, if you want to run Samba in a container and type docker run Samba,

680
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,080
and there's a little more to it than that.

681
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,560
But effectively, you are now piggybacking off the shoulders of giants, right?

682
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,320
That's the whole purpose of containers.

683
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:34,640
You're basically outsourcing a lot of the sysadmin stuff to other people, like building these containers.

684
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:41,680
You're outsourcing those decisions about what goes into them to other people who you maybe trust more

685
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,320
than you trust yourself, which, you know, certainly as a newbie is probably a wise decision.

686
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,400
Maybe as you mature your approach to building systems, you'll decide that actually I know better

687
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,760
and I want to go and build my own stuff.

688
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,960
But I wouldn't say what you're doing is necessarily wrong.

689
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,320
Just use the stuff that Unraid lets you use.

690
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,320
There's a reason you picked Unraid, right?

691
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,920
And that's because it has a simple to use user interface.

692
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,120
You can use their templates to click and install stuff.

693
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,040
I mean, keep doing what you're doing, man.

694
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,840
That's what I say.

695
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:16,480
Yeah, you could absolutely just keep using that and you can mess around with VMs on your local box.

696
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,000
Or if you are ready to build something, I'm going to double down on Alex's recommendation

697
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,400
to go by the perfect media guide, because which if I don't know if he said, but is that perfectmediaserver.com?

698
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,920
Because that gives you the projects to really kind of branch off from there.

699
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,360
I'm not quite as pro magic server sauce as Alex is.

700
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,520
That scares the crap out of me a little bit from just a security standpoint, because ultimately

701
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,880
it's not understanding how the system works that leads people to make security mistakes.

702
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,520
But I do agree with your point that in most cases, the people designing the containers

703
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,040
for popular applications and projects probably know more about what's going on in there than Rob might.

704
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,840
You know, the people creating the application know a hell of a lot about it.

705
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,360
So you're generally going to be all right, but it's definitely worth learning, but it's really easy to learn.

706
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:07,600
And Rob, I wish the built-in tooling was better at explaining to you, like these four containers

707
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,200
are using this same layer and it's all possible to discover.

708
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,880
But I wish it would tell you in terms of like, and that is these applications and this layer

709
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,800
of libraries and Linux, I wish it was more, if you could understand it in those terms,

710
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,320
I think you'd start to click for you.

711
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,400
So what I would recommend you do is pick a container software of choice, go out there

712
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,120
and read about Podman, go out there and read about Docker, and then start playing, get

713
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,760
inside the containers, learn how to do that and explore them and just see what that's

714
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,600
like and understand what's inside there.

715
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,280
And then you start to realize, you know, it's good things, it's easy to get going.

716
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,080
It's generally pretty well built, but there's also a lot of old libraries in there.

717
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:50,880
And you're relying on them to update the software and maintain the security for applications

718
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,840
you're running on your stack.

719
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,800
And so you just need to be cognizant of the trade-offs.

720
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,720
And I think the way you start that is by learning and then, you know, you can take advantage

721
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,800
of tooling around that to maybe get a better insight into what they're doing.

722
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,840
But ultimately don't feel bad for using Unraid.

723
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,840
They are building a good product.

724
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:12,160
I think both Alex and I are not currently Unraid users, but we think it's a pretty

725
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,040
solid product, and I think it's one of those tools that helps people get going and gets

726
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,160
their data off of something like Google and gets it on their own land.

727
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,720
And that's ultimately something that we're both big fans of.

728
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,640
Yeah, Unraid was how I got started.

729
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,440
And then I ended up trying to build some packages for myself for some apps that weren't on the

730
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,480
platform.

731
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,680
And like Chris says, trying to exec into a container, like figuring out what that means

732
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,560
and sort of getting a shell inside a container and poking around and breaking some stuff,

733
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,040
you know, it's that's how I got started.

734
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,120
So absolutely a good route to go.

735
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:50,080
Now, Martin writes in that in the latest episode, you are wondering about one way phone backup.

736
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,960
And for Android, he recommends an app called Foldersync, and I can't recommend it enough.

737
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,000
Thank you, Martin.

738
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,040
Foldersync.

739
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,080
We'll have a link to that in the Play Store, as you would imagine.

740
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,960
Surprise, surprise, it allows simple sync to cloud-based storage from your local folders

741
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,080
on your phone and SD card on your Android device.

742
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,440
It does exactly what it says on the tin, and it's free.

743
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,240
It does offer, I guess, an in-app purchase to remove the ads, but it looks pretty clean

744
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,520
and straightforward.

745
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,920
Gosh, and it supports everything it looks like.

746
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,200
Martin says it automatically recognizes where he is based on SSID, and then it backs up

747
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,360
to the appropriate local NAS system so that he has multiple physical copies, which is

748
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,560
a really nice feature.

749
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,880
I think I've used an earlier version of this, actually.

750
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,240
I think I have and I liked it.

751
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,360
Now, I use the Nextcloud clients on my phones to back up all my photos and things like that.

752
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:44,640
Those are primarily the files that are created on my mobile devices that I want to get off

753
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,000
of those devices.

754
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,880
It doesn't require any plugins in Nextcloud, it's just built into the standard iOS and

755
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,480
Android clients as well, but I think if I was creating something else regularly on my

756
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,520
phone that wasn't a photo or a video, Foldersync looks like it would be the solution.

757
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,760
A big thank you to our site reliability engineers at selfhosted.show slash SRE.

761
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,920
computers.

762
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,880
I'm looking forward to that.

763
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,720
I don't think I've ever heard that story.
