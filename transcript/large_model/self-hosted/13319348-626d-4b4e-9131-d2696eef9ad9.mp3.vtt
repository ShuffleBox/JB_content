00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Alex I'm checking my email every single day right now because my Starlink kit is on its way

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
There's gonna be a game changer for me. I think so. Yeah, like you've unlocked a

00:11.520 --> 00:16.560
Level like you've one upped life if you've got Starlink, you know, it's funny as I started thinking, you know

00:16.560 --> 00:19.700
Like now I need to get serious about a home PC setup

00:19.700 --> 00:23.960
I can always like my work laptop will do or or an iPad will do

00:23.960 --> 00:30.120
But if I'm gonna have like real internet at home now, I got to have like a real PC to connect to that. So

00:30.120 --> 00:35.800
How's it gonna work? Cuz my understanding of Starlink is reasonably limited. I watched a couple of Jeff Gehrling videos

00:35.800 --> 00:37.800
I think that's about as far as it goes

00:38.400 --> 00:40.400
Don't you have to tie it to a specific?

00:40.680 --> 00:47.680
Grid reference so that they have enough satellite bandwidth for you to talk to like it won't work if you drive 50 miles west or something

00:47.680 --> 00:50.140
Right. Yeah, I think it mostly turns out to be like a 30 mile

00:50.140 --> 00:56.060
Area around your service address that you've put on your account is where it's functional. I don't I don't know yet

00:56.060 --> 00:59.860
This is something I'm gonna play with but it sounds like it's pretty straightforward in

01:00.220 --> 01:05.020
most cases to just update your service address and then like it takes effect in like

01:05.620 --> 01:08.740
15 minutes and then you can start setting up in your new location

01:08.740 --> 01:12.600
I imagine that's actually not as smooth as it's going to go

01:12.820 --> 01:15.860
Like I'll try to do it to be like too many users in this area

01:15.860 --> 01:21.780
I recall I was watching a guy on YouTube who was an RVer and was proclaiming that he had

01:22.140 --> 01:29.420
Hacked the Starlink algorithm to let him use it anywhere in actual fact. What he was doing was he was pre staging his

01:30.540 --> 01:33.180
Location in the Starlink app before he got there

01:33.180 --> 01:38.860
So the systems had time to catch up or if where he got to didn't have connection to update his service address

01:38.860 --> 01:43.340
I mean I could see that cuz I generally know where I'm gonna end up parking at, you know before I go there

01:43.340 --> 01:48.940
So I could plug that in before I arrive. The other tricky thing is is I think the little dishy takes like

01:49.340 --> 01:54.220
150 watts pretty much consistently once it's up and running. That's a significant amount of power

01:54.220 --> 01:58.060
In fact, it's like running a whole PC. It is pretty much isn't it and they're not cheap either

01:59.020 --> 02:05.520
So there was the $99 deposit, which I felt was fair. Okay. All right fine, and then there's like a

02:06.100 --> 02:11.660
Separate four hundred and eighty five dollar fee to get the kit and the kit is everything you need

02:11.660 --> 02:15.940
It's like the router Ethernet the PoE injector the dish all of it

02:16.460 --> 02:18.460
But every time I check it just says pending

02:18.500 --> 02:23.300
So you're six hundred dollars in the hole for this thing then and then the monthly service, of course as well

02:23.300 --> 02:26.920
Oh, what does what does that cost? I think it's gonna be in the hundred dollar range

02:27.540 --> 02:34.500
When you don't have good solid bandwidth almost any price that you can conceivably afford to pay is worth it

02:34.580 --> 02:36.980
Yeah, slow internet is worse than no internet

02:36.980 --> 02:41.460
That's what they say. And then once you get that good internet head over to a cloud guru

02:41.460 --> 02:44.380
They are the leader in learning for the cloud Linux and other modern tech skills

02:45.220 --> 02:51.160
Thousands of hands-on labs hundreds of certifications and courses and free cloud sandboxes on their credit card

02:51.160 --> 02:55.820
Not yours go to cloud guru comm get certified get hired get learning

02:55.820 --> 03:02.340
I can only imagine how having decent low ping internet. Do you have any any sense of?

03:02.340 --> 03:09.620
The Starlink kind of ping times yet. I have done a little bit of meta analysis of the reviews and also to their credit

03:09.620 --> 03:14.540
The Starlink folks kind of give you that information in the signup process when they're like, hey, this is a beta

03:14.820 --> 03:16.820
It's gonna go down sometime

03:16.980 --> 03:23.020
You're probably gonna get ping somewhere in the 40 millisecond range is what they kind of warn you for and I that's kind of what?

03:23.020 --> 03:27.740
I've seen from the meta analysis of the reviews. I have seen some reviewers get it as low as 20

03:27.740 --> 03:32.940
Something in the 20 to 40 would be great because 40 is about the best case

03:32.940 --> 03:37.340
I'm ever going to get ever on LTE is about 40 milliseconds

03:37.340 --> 03:43.020
and I know from having done these shows with you now for a long time an LTE connection is

03:44.340 --> 03:47.260
workable, but we end up stepping on each other quite often and

03:48.100 --> 03:50.120
Makes life for our editor more difficult

03:50.120 --> 03:55.740
So lower the ping time for us certainly the better and also I would imagine although we'll see I'll get a sense of this

03:55.740 --> 04:02.300
Is it would hopefully I know it drifts, but hopefully it drifts either less or more consistently

04:02.900 --> 04:09.180
Than LTE where LTE is kind of all over the board depending on all the other users that are in that area

04:09.460 --> 04:16.180
Are there any constraints around the amount of bandwidth you can consume because with LTE that's a big concern, right?

04:16.180 --> 04:17.780
And as far as I know, there's no limits either

04:17.780 --> 04:24.540
I don't know if eventually when they go public if they'll have tiered plans, but that's a huge deal. No, no, no, no

04:24.540 --> 04:26.540
No, I know I know

04:27.180 --> 04:29.180
Even with my quote-unquote

04:29.380 --> 04:35.220
Unlimited LTE plans. I'm really kind of in the doghouse after 300 gigs and around 400 gigs

04:35.220 --> 04:38.340
They're looking at what I'm doing and you know

04:38.340 --> 04:43.100
I get the prioritized and all that kind of stuff and that is like on the extremely high end

04:43.100 --> 04:48.140
Like these are elite rare plans where I can even get that far along before they start getting mad at me

04:48.140 --> 04:55.260
That's crazy. Where are staying last week at my mother-in-law's in rural Norfolk. The only decent internet that she can get is

04:55.740 --> 05:01.860
Through 4g LTE from EE in the UK and she gets 200 gigabytes a month

05:03.260 --> 05:08.620
Bandwidth for her home internet and for me that was a real adjustment, you know dealing with that ping time

05:09.020 --> 05:15.300
Dealing with that lack of bandwidth availability. Welcome to my world. I honestly don't know how you cope with it full-time

05:15.300 --> 05:19.220
I know I know that's why I'm really excited about Starlink even though

05:19.700 --> 05:24.540
there's the downside of putting more junk up in space, which is a serious problem and

05:25.220 --> 05:30.780
These may actually be visible from the ground and maybe you know, there's we're not gonna be happy about that long term

05:31.180 --> 05:34.580
But it's so obvious that at least here in the States

05:34.580 --> 05:40.900
we need a solution to this because my other options are duopoly cell providers or a

05:41.420 --> 05:43.420
monopoly cable provider

05:43.420 --> 05:47.900
That's my options here and it just isn't is it is not long-term

05:48.660 --> 05:52.340
Sustainable or tenable for something as important as our connectivity

05:52.340 --> 05:59.460
Which is how I organize manage and run my entire business and most of my personal life is all online now

05:59.460 --> 06:06.620
And that's true for probably nearly everyone listening to this show and so access to the internet just is so critical that I think it's kind of

06:06.620 --> 06:13.260
Necessary that we have something like Starlink as an option and if they can get these prices down to below what I'm paying for these

06:13.460 --> 06:15.460
ridiculous LTE plans I

06:15.820 --> 06:21.020
Mean that's gonna make it more available to more people and you know, eventually to folks like Alex's mom

06:21.260 --> 06:24.340
It's gonna be a game-changer for a lot of people

06:24.660 --> 06:31.860
There are remote mountain properties that you look at these days on Zillow or rightmove or whatever and you think I'd love to know

06:31.860 --> 06:37.060
It's gonna have to make a DSL. I can't I just can't even consider it, you know

06:37.060 --> 06:42.340
So yeah, and I think ultimately Alex it's gonna make something like my end dream building some off-grid

06:42.900 --> 06:50.660
Property a lot more feasible because all of the areas I've looked at in the Pacific Northwest that I could even begin to remotely afford

06:50.740 --> 06:59.140
That have water or something like that. They're all outside a cellular range. There's nothing around there's no services and the idea

06:59.140 --> 07:06.340
That I could go out there with my solar-powered RV and set up a little dishy and get a connection to the Internet from space

07:07.020 --> 07:11.380
It's just amazing. I mean, it's huge dishy. What an adorable little name

07:11.740 --> 07:15.220
Did you see that home assistant had a release this week? It seems like a big one

07:15.220 --> 07:17.220
you know you it's hard to tell from the outside like

07:17.740 --> 07:21.740
Which ones are kind of just the minor updates and which ones are the big ones?

07:21.740 --> 07:27.660
And the one that came out as we're recording is the October release that came out on October 6th

07:27.660 --> 07:33.660
There's a big thing in here Alex. They got official tuya integration from the folks at tuya

07:33.660 --> 07:42.140
The people that people that organize all the tuya devices and run the tuya infrastructure have now created an official integration for home assistant

07:42.140 --> 07:46.940
So here's the thing about this. I mean, I think it's awesome that we're starting to get actual vendors

07:46.940 --> 07:50.220
Yeah, looking at home assistant and going yes, I want to support that

07:50.220 --> 07:59.060
but also, you know, we've got stuff like cloudfree.shop and mylocalbytes.com and that kind of thing and

07:59.340 --> 08:06.700
There's other things coming along with with pre-tasmota flash devices said that this becomes less important to me

08:07.020 --> 08:09.380
Well even more so because this is the cloud

08:10.340 --> 08:15.180
Integration. Yeah, they worked with the cloud API team not with like this the firmware team

08:15.180 --> 08:22.100
And so this doesn't work for local integration. This uses the cloud connectivity. It looks like it's doing a really good job

08:22.100 --> 08:24.740
In fact, it's much better than before much quicker all of that

08:25.260 --> 08:31.380
It's what you'd want and it's official, but it does require their cloud API, which means it requires an internet connection

08:32.220 --> 08:37.580
Which means it's a disqualifier for me. Just like you said I'd rather get a device I could control locally

08:37.580 --> 08:42.460
In fact, I'd rather get a device that's not on Wi-Fi. What's your preferred poison these days?

08:42.460 --> 08:46.060
Are you a Z-Wave or a ZigBee type of chat? If you go by the number of devices

08:46.060 --> 08:48.180
I have it'd be it'd be Z-Wave

08:48.180 --> 08:53.780
But if you go by where I plan to go to it'd be ZigBee and matter because that's gonna be one of the same

08:53.780 --> 08:55.380
I think eventually yeah matter

08:55.380 --> 09:00.120
I think is really kind of exciting because if a vendor adopts the matter protocol

09:00.260 --> 09:03.340
Then there is a local API if you use matter

09:03.500 --> 09:07.100
Then you've got a local API and like that to me is like well, that's a no-brainer

09:07.100 --> 09:13.380
But right now I invested pretty early in Z-Wave and I've been very happy with my Z-Wave devices

09:13.380 --> 09:16.820
In fact, I'll talk about that in a little bit more but for me Wi-Fi

09:17.060 --> 09:22.180
It's just I like to be able to reboot my access points and maintain control of my devices

09:22.180 --> 09:25.700
I don't like putting that load on my Wi-Fi network

09:25.700 --> 09:31.580
And if it works with Z-Wave or ZigBee, I almost am guaranteed I can make it work somehow with home assistant

09:31.580 --> 09:37.820
That's very true the stuff I talked about in the last episode at my dad's house that the ZigBee buttons I put in here

09:37.900 --> 09:43.060
He's been delighted with them the the little IKEA trad free buttons. I think it's what they called

09:43.920 --> 09:48.220
They're working great. So you get a plus one on ZigBee from me

09:48.340 --> 09:51.480
Anyway, I'm gonna hold out with my Z-Wave devices for now

09:51.480 --> 09:56.260
And then when the matter stuff settles I may make a transition but Alex with the release

09:56.260 --> 10:00.460
they had a live stream kind of like a release party with the developers and they brought on the

10:00.460 --> 10:08.380
Some of the developers from Tuya and they talked about some stats the opt-in stats that people can can get into and then send their

10:08.460 --> 10:12.860
Information off anonymously. They said that for the people that have opted in they now show

10:13.420 --> 10:15.420
90,000 active home assistant users

10:15.700 --> 10:21.720
That's just since April when they launched this statistics package and the people who have opted into it

10:22.420 --> 10:26.220
Also, the data shows that a lot of people have not updated since that April release. Oh

10:26.220 --> 10:28.220
Oh

10:29.020 --> 10:32.600
Boy that's a lot that's a lot of updates since they're doing a monthly now

10:32.940 --> 10:37.220
Also, their analytics show that 40% of home assistant users have a Chromecast

10:38.460 --> 10:41.480
40% is a huge huge number for that kind of thing

10:42.020 --> 10:46.700
Home kit also shows as quite popular and the most popular hardware

10:47.220 --> 10:49.220
Was the Raspberry Pi?

10:49.380 --> 10:54.580
Followed closely by running home assistant in a VM like you do now

10:54.580 --> 10:57.740
Do they take statistics on how many of those Raspberry Pi users are you?

11:00.100 --> 11:06.660
Very fair very fair those all those stats are public at analytics dot home dash assistant dot IO

11:06.660 --> 11:08.660
Or we'll put a link in the show notes

11:08.740 --> 11:15.860
This is also the release for us Z wave users where it's time to migrate to Z wave JS as

11:16.180 --> 11:23.380
Of this release it now supports s2 which is the improved security model and it's short for security to surprise surprise

11:23.380 --> 11:25.380
besides improved security

11:25.820 --> 11:32.200
Devices are also more reliable. They provide greater battery life and less latency compared to the original security mode

11:32.200 --> 11:34.200
That was supported by Z wave JS

11:35.140 --> 11:39.340
Integration will now automatically pick the best and optimal security method available

11:39.340 --> 11:42.660
They have a whole new wizard for adding new devices and it looks sharp

11:42.660 --> 11:44.260
Oh and speaking of wizards

11:44.260 --> 11:49.740
There is now a migration wizard to migrate you from your old Z wave setup to the new Z wave JS

11:49.740 --> 11:51.260
Which is what I was waiting for

11:51.260 --> 11:57.460
However, when I go in my home assistant, it actually still asking me to migrate to open ZW or whatever it was

11:57.460 --> 12:02.780
I don't know why but I'm still getting a migration offer to open ZW and I I don't know if I'm supposed to install

12:03.060 --> 12:06.940
Z wave JS first or or what like they don't give you any information on that

12:06.940 --> 12:13.060
But if your system isn't wonky like mine, they're saying go ahead and make the migration now. It's been pretty refined

12:13.300 --> 12:18.820
It'll walk you through what it's gonna do and what's gonna change and then Alex the developers in the stream kind of doubled down

12:18.820 --> 12:25.380
Which made me feel good about using Z wave. They said this Z wave JS integration is well written

12:25.380 --> 12:31.900
It's well built and it is well maintained and they think it's good code. And so it's solid. It's good

12:31.900 --> 12:36.140
It's a good in fact, they're gonna go for their thinking they haven't said they're gonna do this

12:36.140 --> 12:39.100
But they're thinking seriously about going for official Z wave

12:40.020 --> 12:45.540
Certification from the Z wave group because they're so proud of how this has turned out. Oh, really that'd be a huge success

12:45.540 --> 12:52.980
I bought a Z wave smart door lock on some kind of sale on Black Friday

12:53.180 --> 12:56.140
And it's been sat in a box ever since because I couldn't ever get it to pair

12:56.540 --> 13:01.900
So maybe now is the time I can with that new s2 security support that's in there

13:01.980 --> 13:03.380
Maybe I should give that another go

13:03.380 --> 13:03.860
Yeah

13:03.860 --> 13:09.260
And it gives you a little more information and it's a little more clear about when you should go hit the pair button on

13:09.500 --> 13:13.500
The device like all of that whole process is a little smoother now

13:13.500 --> 13:18.220
It looks with Z wave JS. They did a little live demonstration of a migration on the stream

13:18.220 --> 13:21.980
I just remember it being frustrating as anything, you know when I tried it

13:22.780 --> 13:28.260
Yeah, it feels a bit like a black box, doesn't it? But no, I think I think they're doing they're doing good things

13:28.260 --> 13:33.700
So if you are a Z wave device user, which you know, I just I have I probably have somewhere

13:33.700 --> 13:35.860
I think I have like a dozen Z wave devices

13:35.860 --> 13:41.700
It's not it's not like an unbelievable number that I can't eventually migrate off of but I'll be using them still for a while

13:41.700 --> 13:48.220
All right. I've got a low-key genuinely awesome feature that's come to github. I think in the last two or three months

13:49.020 --> 13:53.260
load up a github repository right now you can do this live and

13:54.420 --> 13:58.420
Open a repository. You just need to be logged in. That's the important thing

13:58.980 --> 14:04.300
When you have that page open press full stop the period key on your keyboard and watch what happens. Oh

14:05.460 --> 14:08.140
That's pretty nice. Oh, look at them

14:08.140 --> 14:13.980
Yeah, all right straight into VS code web suddenly electron doesn't look so bad now hard does it?

14:13.980 --> 14:19.260
It's that repository opened up in VS code, isn't it? Right? It better be. Yep. Oh, that's slick

14:19.300 --> 14:20.260
Okay

14:20.260 --> 14:27.300
impressive and then you open a file you make an edit you press save and it then is because it's part of git the

14:27.700 --> 14:32.140
Git plug-in in VS code. You just commit it directly in there and boom you're done

14:32.140 --> 14:38.100
Oh my gosh, if you're opening a third-party repository though, and you make a change and you save it

14:38.100 --> 14:43.660
It asks you then if you want to fork it and then automatically helps you with the pool

14:44.420 --> 14:49.780
Merge request model at github has Wow, it is so cool in the browser

14:50.140 --> 14:52.580
When did they sneak this in? I don't know

14:52.580 --> 14:56.340
I mean I first found it someone on our discord told me a couple of months ago about it

14:56.340 --> 15:00.600
I think of course, but I've been using it a lot for my notes in the last few weeks

15:00.600 --> 15:03.600
actually, I've got a private repository on github I use for notes and

15:05.460 --> 15:12.800
I've actually just ended up using VS code in the browser on github.com. It's not very self-hosted is it but it works very well

15:14.340 --> 15:18.380
And I want to mention our friends at a cloud guru have a course on the Linux kernel

15:18.380 --> 15:22.960
It's a standalone course, but it's also part of a learning path to prepare you for the LPG 201 exam

15:23.300 --> 15:27.580
You learn how the Linux kernel provides an interface between hardware and software

15:27.580 --> 15:35.180
you'll compile a kernel from start to finish and of course, you'll cover kernel runtime management troubleshooting adding removing modules and

15:35.660 --> 15:40.480
Modifying the modules on boot. We'll have a link in our show notes or you can go to a cloud guru and search for the

15:40.480 --> 15:42.480
Linux kernel

15:43.660 --> 15:46.860
So we were just talking about Zigbee and Zed wave and all that kind of stuff

15:46.860 --> 15:51.140
So I was really excited to see that the home assistant has a new hardware project out

15:51.180 --> 15:56.260
Yeah, and it's been funded the home assistant amber, which is based around the compute module 4

15:56.260 --> 16:00.780
With their own board. It's got an SSD connector. It has Zigbee built-in

16:01.140 --> 16:06.300
In fact the devs on the stream said no SD cards. We hate SD cards

16:06.300 --> 16:13.180
So you can either use an SSD or it'll come with a MMC built into it. They're gonna chip it with a transparent case. I

16:13.820 --> 16:15.820
Think maybe in part for radio

16:15.820 --> 16:20.300
It's plastic for radio transparency and then they they have a whole post on why they chose transparent

16:20.540 --> 16:23.220
Some models will come with a POE hat as well

16:23.220 --> 16:30.820
It's pretty nice-looking. Although I don't know if it's gonna be as fast as the home assistant blue. Well, no, I mean my only concern

16:30.820 --> 16:34.220
about this box and let me just preface everything I'm about to say with

16:35.060 --> 16:38.980
the fact I think that these kind of projects from home assistant themselves are

16:39.700 --> 16:42.340
Wonderful, and I'm so happy to see that they're doing it

16:42.660 --> 16:50.900
My only concern is that putting the compute module 4 into a product at this stage in the Raspberry Pi 4's life cycle

16:50.900 --> 16:54.820
Feels like we're getting towards the end of the Pi 4 cycle

16:54.820 --> 17:02.180
Maybe are we going to be able to upgrade this to a CM 5 one day? Probably not. Will there be a home assistant?

17:03.060 --> 17:08.500
Burnt sienna instead or something. I don't know but that's my only reservation. Everything else looks great

17:09.140 --> 17:11.140
Yeah, perhaps that could be an issue

17:11.380 --> 17:15.940
I don't know if we know for sure if there will be a compute module 5 this may be a you know

17:15.940 --> 17:18.580
Once every few years. That's a good point Christopher

17:18.580 --> 17:23.300
the other thing that holds the Raspberry Pi 4 back right now is

17:24.020 --> 17:30.180
Absolutely the IO situation and they solve that with emmc or an SSD

17:30.500 --> 17:33.300
you know, I mean it's no x86 box, right like

17:34.100 --> 17:36.420
I've got jobs where I need more powerful systems, but

17:37.380 --> 17:42.900
I am doing more than ever with my Pi 4. I mean now it's doing MQTT and it's doing

17:42.900 --> 17:45.780
energy metric collection and and graphing and

17:48.820 --> 17:52.820
It's still just chugging right along like it's just oh and also for a short period of time

17:52.820 --> 17:54.740
I even ran the wise bridge on it

17:54.740 --> 17:56.740
It was still doing just fine

17:56.740 --> 18:01.060
Oh that thing chomps the CPU only with two camera feeds. Let me be clear and I turned it off

18:01.060 --> 18:06.820
I did turn it off, but it was but home assistant everything was still working like it still has a little bit of oomph to spare

18:06.820 --> 18:14.260
It still has a little bit of oomph to spare and uh, I could see the compute 4 module being enough machine

18:14.820 --> 18:19.460
For most people until you get into more advanced logging and graphing and stuff like that

18:19.540 --> 18:26.340
So what does this mean for the blue then moving forward? Well, it seems like the blue is kind of gonna phase out over time

18:27.060 --> 18:30.420
Uh, I think the words used were we're gonna take the lessons learned

18:31.060 --> 18:34.100
And we're applying that to the amber one thing about the blue that

18:34.100 --> 18:40.900
Was noted by the developers is that it's a board that they took that already existed

18:41.780 --> 18:44.420
And then, you know, they flashed home assistant onto it

18:44.420 --> 18:49.300
but if you want zigbee or z wave or matter support you got to add a dongle and

18:49.860 --> 18:57.220
It's it's not really flexible in that regard where uh, this is a device that they kind of control the board that the compute module

18:57.220 --> 19:02.340
Is going to sit in they can integrate things like zigbee. They can do things like poe

19:02.340 --> 19:06.660
Poe and it seems like when you look at also their hardware stats

19:06.660 --> 19:12.660
We talked about earlier and you see so many so many users are using the raspberry pi

19:13.380 --> 19:15.380
It probably makes sense from like a software

19:16.100 --> 19:22.820
End user reliability stability standpoint to base your core product on that same platform if you can

19:23.300 --> 19:30.180
Because then improvements you make there are going to benefit everybody else also using the raspberry pi that isn't running on an amber

19:30.180 --> 19:36.500
They're just on a pi. Yeah, I hadn't considered that angle. That's an interesting one and alex if you if you'll allow me there's one small

19:37.380 --> 19:41.380
Update in this october home assistant release that I wanted to talk about

19:41.940 --> 19:45.460
It wasn't initially going to cover so I feel kind of embarrassed but it's icons

19:45.620 --> 19:51.300
They updated the material design icons to version six. They've added 400 new icons

19:52.260 --> 19:53.060
and

19:53.060 --> 19:54.100
um

19:54.100 --> 19:59.060
if you haven't done this yet to your home assistant update, I know all this has been very homeless assistant specific, but

19:59.060 --> 20:05.220
I tell you what. It made me love my dashboard a little bit more when I went in there and just tweaked the icons

20:05.780 --> 20:12.340
For all the different entities. So they all have unique individual icons that represent what they are and rumor has it based on

20:12.660 --> 20:16.660
What the devs accidentally said on the live stream. They're going to include in the

20:17.220 --> 20:18.660
lovelace

20:18.660 --> 20:24.900
Wizard a new icon picker soon that lets you easily pick from these icons. Oh good because the mdi

20:24.900 --> 20:28.420
Mdi website that you pick the icons from

20:28.740 --> 20:34.980
Slow is the slowest damn web page to load on the entire freaking internet. I swear so slow so bad. Yeah

20:35.860 --> 20:37.860
I i'm glad they have it but it's so slow

20:38.260 --> 20:40.660
Yeah, so they're gonna have an icon picker. It'll be built in

20:41.220 --> 20:43.940
And these these material design icons are in home assistant

20:43.940 --> 20:50.020
There's so many for your different devices that just kind of give you a nice visual indicator what it do. Mm-hmm

20:50.660 --> 20:52.660
You gotta know what it do

20:52.660 --> 20:54.660
Lino.com

20:54.720 --> 20:59.220
Slash ssh talk about people who know what they are doing. They've been doing this since

21:00.240 --> 21:03.620
2003 one of the very first companies in cloud computing that's

21:04.020 --> 21:06.740
Knowing what you're doing and 18 years later lino

21:06.820 --> 21:13.300
It is the largest independent open cloud provider in the world with 11 different data centers around the world

21:13.540 --> 21:16.580
So it's lino.com slash ssh you go there to get

21:17.840 --> 21:19.840

We're an independent operation a couple of guys doing our thing here and you taking advantage of something great like this lino.com

21:31.680 --> 21:34.160
Slash-ssh man, that's the circle of life for us

21:34.560 --> 21:36.880
Plus you can go in there and just see how great it is

21:37.200 --> 21:44.720
It really is a fantastic service with great performance and they've really invested in the dashboard and the hardware and the networking and well

21:44.880 --> 21:49.440
The whole stack really like if you want to switch over from zoom to jitzy

21:49.440 --> 21:55.120
They got a one-click deployment for that and it's like a great opportunity to take advantage of our $100 credit

21:55.600 --> 22:00.560
They really have the best in class experience because they've been focusing on making this great for the last 18 years

22:00.880 --> 22:02.880
Their mission has remained unchanged

22:03.200 --> 22:10.640
Making cloud computing accessible affordable for all and once you get in you'll see that they have things like s3 compatible object storage

22:10.720 --> 22:12.720
There's so much you can do with that

22:12.800 --> 22:14.080
They have bare metal servers

22:14.080 --> 22:20.000
If your application load requires that ddos protection vlan support a powerful dns manager

22:20.560 --> 22:25.840
And if you like to do your infrastructure by code, they've got terraform and kubernetes support to help you

22:26.240 --> 22:30.560
Well integrate with everything else you're doing and with pricing 30 to 50 cheaper

22:30.960 --> 22:34.800
Maybe it's a great opportunity to go multi-cloud. Why get locked into a single vendor?

22:35.680 --> 22:37.440
Leno can help you spread that out

22:37.440 --> 22:43.040
So you're not just dependent on one hyperscaler and as we've seen just the week that we're recording sometimes

22:43.040 --> 22:48.720
Sometimes they go down and if you ever get stuck linode has the best customer support in the industry

22:48.720 --> 22:53.120
They really have amazing 24 7 customer support by phone ticket or social

22:53.600 --> 22:57.760
And then they back all that up with hundreds of guides and thousands of tutorials

22:58.320 --> 23:04.560

23:17.600 --> 23:22.400
Now what were you doing earlier in the week you weren't you know messing about with bgp routes were you

23:23.920 --> 23:26.800
No, no, i'm not pushing out changes to remove dns entries

23:27.200 --> 23:27.920
Uh, just you know

23:27.920 --> 23:31.600
Of course listeners are probably picking up on the fact that this is the week that facebook went down

23:31.600 --> 23:36.960
And alex and I are watching this with popcorn going. Oh, could you imagine what it's like to be on site right now?

23:37.120 --> 23:41.200
Where they can't even badge in let alone figure out why everything's down

23:41.680 --> 23:47.520
What a nightmare or send each other an email. That's the thing like, you know, bob at facebook.com would no longer work

23:47.520 --> 23:53.360
Would it man if uh, if uh, if I didn't know any better, I think somebody probably lost their job

23:53.760 --> 23:59.920
Well, I mean the conspiracy theorist in me wonders. It's all a little fishy that it happened on the exact same

23:59.920 --> 24:03.440
Week as the uh testimony the whistleblower thing

24:04.000 --> 24:05.200
You know

24:05.200 --> 24:10.080
Is it a deflection tactic or is it just genuine genuinely a screw up? I I don't know but

24:10.640 --> 24:17.760
You gotta wonder sometimes. I don't think it was a deflection tactic. I mean it was if it was that was a very significant self-inflicted wound

24:18.320 --> 24:22.400
Yeah, true. I actually saw one of my neighbors sharing on facebook today

24:22.800 --> 24:27.280
10 facebook alternatives for 2021. I thought that was so funny

24:27.280 --> 24:33.280
Yeah, and telegram saw a massive rush of new users, you know, i'd buy an insider

24:34.160 --> 24:39.680
Job before i'd buy an intentional screw up, you know like rage quit kind of thing. Yeah, maybe

24:40.480 --> 24:43.600
Maybe the zuck didn't give somebody the smoked meats they were after

24:44.720 --> 24:50.880
I've been a little too distracted to really pay attention though. I got I got sucked into the rabbit hole of energy monitoring, right?

24:50.880 --> 24:52.320
Yeah, because you're you're back home now

24:52.320 --> 24:55.360
So you've actually got some free time instead of just driving all day

24:55.360 --> 24:58.080
And home assistant while I was on the roads

24:58.080 --> 25:03.360
I didn't have a chance to really look at it added energy monitoring support where you can actually like get some

25:03.760 --> 25:06.720
Good stats and whatnot in home assistant. Mm-hmm

25:06.960 --> 25:12.720
And identify batteries and utility sources and and even like, you know fuel consumption costs

25:13.600 --> 25:15.600
If you want to monitor that

25:15.680 --> 25:17.680
So I thought okay, I got to try this

25:18.080 --> 25:23.120
And I have a couple of z wave smart plugs that do energy monitoring. I've never really used that

25:23.120 --> 25:28.800
So that is sort of the route that I looked at this like well, why don't why don't I try to see if I can?

25:28.800 --> 25:30.560
get my existing

25:30.560 --> 25:32.240
smart plugs to work

25:32.240 --> 25:38.320
And for listeners that don't remember I have I have two setups. I have a home automation setup in my rv

25:38.400 --> 25:42.880
Which is pretty extensive and then I have like a mini version at the studio

25:43.760 --> 25:45.760
it's like a smaller instance of

25:46.240 --> 25:50.000
of uh home home assistant it runs on the home assistant blue

25:50.000 --> 25:54.880
And in a way it's it's often kind of like a good testing ground because it's so much simpler

25:54.960 --> 25:58.480
there's just there's less entities to go through and all that kind of stuff and

25:59.440 --> 26:01.440
I noticed after the update

26:01.760 --> 26:06.160
To the home assistant blues version of home assistant, which is comes out at the same time. Everybody else does

26:07.040 --> 26:08.240
that

26:08.240 --> 26:13.680
I just had energy monitoring like my belkin wemo plugs that I happen to have that I only use here in the studio

26:14.320 --> 26:18.400
We're just reporting their energy usage and home assistant had like a little

26:18.400 --> 26:23.540
Diagram of where power was going and how much power had been used that day and I thought

26:24.420 --> 26:25.380
Wow

26:25.380 --> 26:30.500
That looks great. I'd love to have that at home where I actually care about my power and all that kind of stuff

26:30.580 --> 26:31.940
I thought to myself

26:31.940 --> 26:34.180
So I go home and I don't have any of that

26:35.140 --> 26:40.180
My plugs are monitoring their draw. They're seeing how many how many watts are being used

26:40.740 --> 26:46.100
But home assistant couldn't care less. It's like if I bring up the sensor. Yeah, it knows how many watts are being used

26:46.100 --> 26:48.900
But when I go to configure an energy device, it's just

26:49.860 --> 26:56.500
Whatever bro. There's no devices giving you any stats for some reason. I've just got this picture of home assistant being like

26:57.380 --> 26:58.020
this

26:58.020 --> 27:04.420
Uh beavis and butthead style character sat on a couch in the corner with a backwards baseball cap and a cigarette in the other hand going

27:05.300 --> 27:10.020
Whatever bro. I don't care. Yeah, you can't have that. I don't care and it's so to me

27:10.020 --> 27:15.540
It's like okay. There's something wrong. Obviously these devices are like not giving home assistant the information you need

27:15.540 --> 27:20.260
But when you go into the developer tools and you look at the state attributes and the states it's sending back

27:20.660 --> 27:24.580
It's clearly saying this is the amount of power being consumed

27:24.980 --> 27:31.940
It's in the watts format and it is this many watts like it's easily readable by the human eye and i'm thinking to myself

27:32.420 --> 27:35.140
What's going on here? Why can't I see this power draw?

27:35.460 --> 27:38.340
And I want to I want to not only get an overview of my power draw

27:38.340 --> 27:40.500
But I want to start building automations that say

27:40.500 --> 27:45.620
Hey, hey when two appliances when these two smart plugs because I can just say these two together

27:46.260 --> 27:51.300
They're on one circuit. I know that so when these two smart plugs both have a draw over 500 watts

27:51.860 --> 27:54.180
Turn off the heater smart plug always turn it off

27:54.180 --> 27:57.940
So that way the wife can turn on the toaster and when it starts drawing a thousand watts

27:58.260 --> 28:00.260
It turns off the heater that's drawing 800 watts

28:00.660 --> 28:05.460
And that's that's essentially what I want. And if anybody has a blueprint or a good advice on how to set that up

28:05.620 --> 28:06.900
Please let me know

28:06.900 --> 28:10.580
Ultimately, that's what i'm trying to get to I haven't gotten there yet. But what I did do

28:11.140 --> 28:17.800
Is I managed to get my damn energy monitor and it took quite a journey. I have to say because of ultimately

28:19.300 --> 28:22.420
You have to get the data in the format that home assistant wants

28:23.060 --> 28:26.980
So first you got to have home assistant 2021.8 or newer

28:27.860 --> 28:33.460
And you need a smart plug or an energy monitoring device like one of those clamp devices or a shelly

28:33.460 --> 28:36.500
That reports in kilowatt hours

28:37.220 --> 28:38.740
all my plugs

28:38.740 --> 28:40.740
report in watts

28:41.220 --> 28:44.040
As in watts currently being consumed

28:45.220 --> 28:49.380
Home assistant wants kilowatt hours and then it'll do all the math for you from there

28:50.020 --> 28:53.160
So what you have to do is you have to get an integration

28:53.860 --> 28:55.120
called

28:55.120 --> 28:56.180
integration

28:56.180 --> 28:58.100
It's a math integration

28:58.100 --> 29:04.820
Which will take the watts and convert them into kilowatt hours for you and then produce a new sensor

29:05.940 --> 29:08.100
That shows that energy information in kilowatt hours

29:08.740 --> 29:12.020
I have a configuration.yaml entry example in the show notes

29:12.900 --> 29:14.900
Then once you have that

29:14.980 --> 29:20.180
The new energy utilities that are built into home assistant will see this device as something it can pull stats from

29:20.580 --> 29:24.980
And we'll start giving you your usage. So I have to go through for each one of my smart plugs

29:24.980 --> 29:27.700
And I have to do this. I have to create this

29:29.060 --> 29:31.860
like this template sensor that takes

29:32.640 --> 29:35.060
information from the state of my smart plug

29:36.020 --> 29:39.540
And formats it in a way that home assistant wants and I have the examples in the show notes

29:39.540 --> 29:42.820
But I had to go deep because I had to learn a little bit of how templating works

29:42.900 --> 29:44.740
I had to I had to learn about

29:44.740 --> 29:46.740
creating new kinds of sensors

29:47.460 --> 29:49.060
It was it was really quite the journey

29:49.060 --> 29:55.700
I I naively expected to just do the update get energy monitoring and see my smart plugs report in there

29:56.180 --> 30:02.740
Boy, was I wrong. Sometimes we get a bit spoiled with home system. Don't we it picks up so much. It does so much and then

30:03.600 --> 30:08.820
Occasionally, we actually have to break out some uh davinci code to find out what we actually wanted

30:09.140 --> 30:12.980
I think this is one of those examples and I felt like there was so much out there that

30:13.460 --> 30:18.100
Didn't apply since the new energy monitoring was introduced. So like a lot of the help

30:18.100 --> 30:21.220
was old and no longer relevant and

30:21.940 --> 30:28.180
Because my smart plugs I guess aren't as common. Um, there's not as many people that have solved this problem

30:28.740 --> 30:31.540
So just yeah, it was I felt like I was searching

30:31.940 --> 30:36.340
Niche resources and it took me a while to even just try to figure out the language

30:36.420 --> 30:39.780
I need and figure out what the requirements were of home assistant and all of that

30:40.100 --> 30:45.460
That is a real problem with with projects like home assistant that moves so fast to see it a lot with kubernetes at work as well

30:45.460 --> 30:46.260
is

30:46.260 --> 30:48.260
that kind of uh

30:49.220 --> 30:51.940
google entropy of of stuff like

30:52.820 --> 30:59.060
A post, you know google will think a year old post isn't too old to surface as the top result

30:59.540 --> 31:02.660
When in actual fact in home assistant land that may as well be 10 years ago

31:03.380 --> 31:07.780
Yeah, that's exactly right. Um, and then you know alex when I got it all kind of done

31:08.900 --> 31:10.820
I realized it's okay

31:10.820 --> 31:16.260
It's pretty basic at this point because I don't have all of my battery and solar information in there

31:16.820 --> 31:22.100
It really wasn't worth the journey. I actually like the dashboards I created myself

31:23.060 --> 31:29.220
Better and i'll have a few links in the show notes it it involved uh setting up a history stats integration

31:29.220 --> 31:35.540
So I could collect historical information about my power usage and then I used a utility meter integration

31:36.180 --> 31:38.180
and that let my

31:38.180 --> 31:42.900
Virtual energy monitors i'd set up that produce kilowatt hours show up as a utility source now

31:43.700 --> 31:47.460
That lets me do all kinds of things like now I have a dashboard

31:48.420 --> 31:49.940
That shows me

31:49.940 --> 31:51.700
if today

31:51.700 --> 31:56.740
My heaters are using more power than they were say three days ago. I have a three-day window

31:57.380 --> 31:59.380
On my power usage of my heaters

31:59.780 --> 32:01.780
And I can kind of tell

32:02.500 --> 32:04.500
When i'm kind of using more power and maybe

32:04.500 --> 32:08.580
I can make adjustments based on that if I want I actually haven't decided to take any action on that right now

32:08.580 --> 32:11.080
I'm, just collecting the information and collecting historical information

32:12.020 --> 32:15.700
And so when summer comes around i'll have a totally, you know different set of data

32:15.780 --> 32:19.320
And then when the whole year is completed, I think the information is going to be pretty fascinating

32:19.940 --> 32:25.140
And i'll probably be able to overlay it with temperature information and all kinds of stuff. So I brought together

32:26.020 --> 32:29.140
the history stats integration with the utility meter

32:29.140 --> 32:35.960
Integration and I have again an example of what that looks like in your configuration.yaml linked in the show notes

32:36.360 --> 32:41.080
So now what that's done is it's created these virtual sensors that i've built dashboards around in home assistant

32:41.320 --> 32:46.280
They give me all this information that I think that's where they're going with the built-in energy support

32:46.360 --> 32:48.680
But I like my version better that I built myself

32:49.240 --> 32:53.640
It's not too bad actually 17 lines of code to do all that history stat stuff. It's not

32:54.340 --> 32:58.440
Unreasonable and it's very readable like it all makes sense when you read it. You can see what i'm doing

32:58.440 --> 33:04.040
It's there's nothing tricky about it. Yeah, that's very true. Now something else we've talked about on the show previously is

33:04.980 --> 33:06.360
de-googlifying

33:06.360 --> 33:10.680
I'll be honest on whilst i've been in england. I haven't been paying much attention to that

33:10.680 --> 33:13.080
I've just been getting on with the business of traveling

33:13.560 --> 33:14.440
however

33:14.440 --> 33:21.400
You mentioned in lup this week, uh linux unplugged dot com slash 426 a tool called tube sync

33:21.720 --> 33:25.000
Yeah, think of tube sync as a pvr for youtube you give it

33:25.000 --> 33:29.880
channels and playlists or if you're familiar with sonar it's like sonar for youtube

33:30.280 --> 33:34.360
And then it goes out and pulls down the videos and it gives you a dashboard to tell you

33:34.760 --> 33:36.760
How many video sources you're pulling from?

33:37.160 --> 33:41.000
What's coming up next exactly like you might expect from something like sonar?

33:41.400 --> 33:46.600
It's a pretty advanced ui and there's a docker compose that gets most of it set up for you, too

33:46.600 --> 33:50.840
Alex including the elastic search stuff. You might need now the reason I brought this up on this show

33:50.840 --> 33:54.920
uh is is this isn't linux unplugged extras, but uh,

33:55.560 --> 34:00.920
Uh, I actually found something called media cms dot io and this is essentially

34:01.560 --> 34:06.440
a youtube front end clone. So what I was thinking about doing was

34:07.000 --> 34:12.840
Originally anyway, I was going to use tube sync to download the videos from youtube just as an archiving

34:13.400 --> 34:13.960
type

34:13.960 --> 34:15.560
uh utility

34:15.560 --> 34:22.920
Bring them into plex maybe because there are some people on the plex forums that have youtube metadata agents and that kind of thing

34:23.400 --> 34:29.800
But I think what I might end up doing is using this media cms. Ios to self host my own kind of

34:30.580 --> 34:35.560
Pseudo youtube instance thing. Have you seen this? Oh, this is neat

34:35.640 --> 34:42.120
Yes, and it it is obviously inspired by the youtube ui but good on them. They've taken the best elements in this

34:42.120 --> 34:47.320
And I think it looks really solid. They got dark mode. They got light mode

34:48.360 --> 34:53.000
And it could really end up making a perfect curated youtube and wow

34:53.080 --> 34:55.400
I could I could see it being a lot of work for what you want to do

34:56.120 --> 34:58.600
Man, this could be a slam dunk for parents

34:59.320 --> 35:01.080
This could be a great way

35:01.080 --> 35:05.800
You could take tube sync and pull in the approved channels that you're comfortable with your kids watching

35:06.280 --> 35:08.280
Have tube sync pull it down to the file system

35:08.280 --> 35:12.120
And then point media cms right at that and it's a curated youtube

35:12.360 --> 35:16.440
I wonder how they handle video transcoding because obviously youtube has

35:17.000 --> 35:19.240
A whole bunch of stuff when you upload video to it

35:19.240 --> 35:25.400
It transcodes to all the different formats and then you just switch on the fly the the quality that you're streaming does

35:26.200 --> 35:31.880
Does this have any function for that? I don't see any quality options in the playback. Oh, yeah. No, it's under the settings

35:31.880 --> 35:36.200
It's right there and it says it has multiple transcoding profiles same defaults

35:36.200 --> 35:40.840
It says for multiple dimensions from 20 from 240p up to 1080p

35:41.480 --> 35:46.120
Experimental support for remote workers. So I guess there's a stuff a bunch of stuff. We could figure out there

35:46.440 --> 35:51.320
That's this could be a fun project. That's something to put on our list after I get done solving energy

35:52.600 --> 35:55.800
Yeah, and then world hunger and world peace and uh

35:56.440 --> 35:58.440
Covid as well. You got to solve that one, too

35:58.440 --> 36:01.400
And then and then we'll get on redoing jb.com

36:01.400 --> 36:06.360
But we do have one thing we can solve for people if they are an icloud

36:07.000 --> 36:11.960
Slash iphone user and you got your pictures up there. You came across a really handy tool

36:12.520 --> 36:17.880
To help pull all of your icloud photos down locally to your machine. Yeah, we were talking about this

36:17.960 --> 36:21.640
Where was it in the jupiter broadcasting telegram chat actually?

36:22.360 --> 36:25.400
Someone was asking, you know, how do you back up your iphone?

36:25.400 --> 36:32.600
Pictures and stuff like that because of the way that ios has very restrictive background api kind of it

36:33.000 --> 36:35.080
kills anything in the background that's

36:36.040 --> 36:39.160
Going to drain battery unlike android. That's a lot more permissive

36:39.800 --> 36:41.800
It means you can't run stuff like

36:42.340 --> 36:47.800
Resilio sync or sync thing very effectively or there's another one on android called folder sync

36:48.920 --> 36:50.120
and so

36:50.120 --> 36:55.560
This neat app is actually called gimme-i photos, which is kind of a funny name

36:56.200 --> 36:59.000
And this sidesteps all of ios's problems

36:59.720 --> 37:02.680
With backgrounding api's and on device, you know

37:03.320 --> 37:05.320
Image management and stuff like that

37:05.560 --> 37:08.440
Because it hooks directly into icloud

37:08.760 --> 37:12.200
The only caveat being is you got to be okay with putting your photos up in icloud

37:12.280 --> 37:13.720
But I think what alex is driving at there

37:13.720 --> 37:18.040
It's like that's the only one that's really going to work reliably with the way the iphone backgrounding works

37:18.040 --> 37:22.840
If you want them off the phone reliably automatically, it's going to have to be icloud photo on an iphone

37:23.080 --> 37:25.800
So that's why this is so great and because it's python

37:26.200 --> 37:30.200
You don't have to be on a mac. You could run it on a linux box or a windows box, too

37:30.520 --> 37:35.480
Yeah, I ran this just on a normal linux server. I think I ran it out of a container because i'm

37:36.040 --> 37:37.800
That's just who I am

37:37.800 --> 37:40.440
The really nice thing about it and I didn't expect this at all

37:40.840 --> 37:43.240
I didn't even think about this until I tried it

37:43.240 --> 37:49.820
It uses a python library underneath which actually supports the icloud two-factor authentication

37:50.420 --> 37:51.560
mechanisms

37:51.560 --> 37:56.520
So when I brought this up for the first time a little pop-up appeared on my mac to say hey

37:56.520 --> 38:02.120
Someone's trying to log in as you back in rally. Is this you and here's your two-factor code and I was like, huh?

38:02.280 --> 38:03.640
Did not expect that

38:03.640 --> 38:08.680
Yeah, that made me feel a little bit better that it was kind of legit about how it's authorizing against the icloud servers

38:08.680 --> 38:11.400
It seems to be using like an official apple api for that

38:11.400 --> 38:16.200
And I think it's great for running on your nas. If you've got a nas box that you can shell into

38:16.680 --> 38:21.640
You could go into your directory of choice on your nas and execute this thing and it's just going to sit there and download

38:21.720 --> 38:24.920
Photos all day long and I think for me the absolute killer

38:25.720 --> 38:31.160
Use case are like my parents phones, you know a couple of parents use android a couple use

38:31.800 --> 38:32.840
ios

38:32.840 --> 38:37.320
And the ios ones i've really struggled to get the photos out of icloud into anything

38:37.320 --> 38:42.700
Meaningful off their phones into anything meaningful like next cloud even is a bit of a crap shoot on ios

38:43.260 --> 38:45.260
And this just solves that problem

38:45.820 --> 38:52.860
Altogether i'm not the only thing i'm not totally certain on is how long that two-factor authentication token lasts for

38:53.340 --> 38:58.860
And I guess time will tell but uh, i'm going to set this up for my parents this week whilst i'm here and then

38:59.420 --> 39:01.420
report back when it uh

39:01.420 --> 39:05.340
You know in six months and let you know how it's how it's gone. And are you thinking just cronit?

39:05.340 --> 39:09.260
So it just runs automatically every night or something. Yeah, exactly

39:09.260 --> 39:13.660
Put it put it on a timer and then let it download every day every week. Whatever. Yeah

39:13.740 --> 39:16.380
Yeah, that will be interesting to see how long that two-factor authentication

39:16.380 --> 39:19.580
If it is it I bet you it must have some time expiration

39:19.660 --> 39:25.040
So you'll have to check back in and see if either a it generates a new prompt or b just breaks quietly

39:28.460 --> 39:30.460
Backblaze.com

39:30.460 --> 39:36.220
Backblaze.com slash ssh go there to get a free trial. No credit card required. Just get peace of mind

39:36.220 --> 39:41.340
Knowing your files are backed up securely in the cloud with backblaze. It's seven dollars a month

39:41.500 --> 39:48.060
No gimmicks you get unlimited backup for your mac or your pc your movies your music your photos your videos your projects

39:48.380 --> 39:56.540
All the data and backblaze now has over an exabyte of customer data backed up and counting with 50 billion files restored for their customers

39:56.860 --> 39:58.300
You can do web restores

39:58.300 --> 40:01.580
If that's how you like to roll you can restore files by the app

40:01.740 --> 40:03.980
If that's how you want to get to files on the go

40:04.060 --> 40:10.380
I don't know how you do and they also offer restore by mail check this out a flash key or a hard drive that you

40:10.380 --> 40:14.860
Can grab from them ship to your door overnight with your data restored to it

40:15.020 --> 40:20.380
But here's the best part if you send the hard drive back within 30 days you get a full refund

40:20.700 --> 40:25.180
Now that's some peace of mind if you lose your data and you've got a lot of things you're going to need to recover

40:25.180 --> 40:29.900
It's nice having a physical hard drive mailed to you overnight by fedex

40:30.300 --> 40:33.980
And if you're worried about accidentally deleting files for an extra two dollars a month

40:34.060 --> 40:36.700
You can increase your retention history to one year

40:37.020 --> 40:40.940
Their mobile apps mean you can get access to those same files when you're out and about on the go

40:41.340 --> 40:47.980
And of course backblaze has been recommended by new york times by macworld by tom's guide nine to five mac and many more

40:48.300 --> 40:52.800
But why not go see it for yourself? You get a free 15 day trial at backblaze.com

40:52.800 --> 40:54.460
slash

40:54.460 --> 41:00.880
ssh 15 days means plenty of time to upload and download some files and get a real feel for the service

41:01.360 --> 41:03.360
And you know backblaze has been around for a while

41:03.520 --> 41:09.700
They started 14 years ago to create a business that's equally fair and good for its customers partners employees

41:10.140 --> 41:12.960
investors and the greater community and since

41:13.660 --> 41:16.560
2013 they've been publishing their hard drive reports

41:16.880 --> 41:17.520
That's a report

41:17.520 --> 41:22.880
We make sure to never miss and it's a real value to the entire industry too because of the amount of disks

41:23.200 --> 41:30.080
The real scale that backblaze is working with they can get some genuine insights and now after 14 years

41:30.880 --> 41:35.680
They have over 500 000 customers in a hundred and seventy five countries

41:36.540 --> 41:41.360
Backblaze.com slash ssh no credit card required get started on a free 15 day trial

41:41.840 --> 41:45.120
And start backing up your data start getting some peace of mind

41:45.120 --> 41:47.120
backblaze.com slash

41:47.340 --> 41:49.340
ssh

41:50.420 --> 41:55.220
Now I mentioned tail scale in the last episode which was a brand new project to me

41:55.300 --> 41:59.060
But it turns out a lot of you guys had already figured this one out well ahead of me

41:59.620 --> 42:05.460
And zahid writes in hello. I was just listening to your latest episode and heard about your love for tail scale

42:06.020 --> 42:12.580
Not sure if you're aware, but there are synology packages available for it as well. Keep up the great work. Cheers zahid

42:12.580 --> 42:14.900
Hey, that's handy. Yeah, it really is

42:14.900 --> 42:19.140
I mean that was actually the only reason I ended up looking at uh tail scale in the first place was

42:19.620 --> 42:24.820
I was futzing about with that synology naz ready to put it at my mom's house and uh, I was like

42:25.380 --> 42:27.860
What's this tail scale thing? I'm pretty sure i've heard of it

42:27.940 --> 42:31.300
and then I did a bit of research figured out it was wire guard and was like

42:32.020 --> 42:33.940
I'll just give this a go

42:33.940 --> 42:39.460
And then within 10 minutes i'd built out everything I was trying to achieve with wire guard for several days prior

42:39.460 --> 42:44.340
So no kidding huge fan of tail scale and it you know real success story

42:44.900 --> 42:50.260
My mom took it back from my mother-in-law's house where she you know came to meet my daughter and stuff like that

42:51.300 --> 42:57.140
Took it back to her house plugged in one ethernet cable the power cable pressed the on button on the synology

42:57.780 --> 43:03.620
And within a couple of minutes it had booted and tail scale had registered it. I didn't have to do any dynamic dns

43:03.620 --> 43:09.140
No, firewall changes. It was just magic. I swear. It was awesome

43:09.700 --> 43:14.900
That's why we've been seeing so much love this week erno writes and i'm beyond ecstatic

43:15.140 --> 43:20.500
I listened to episode 54 self-hosted on my way to my morning mountain biking and as soon as I came home

43:20.580 --> 43:22.580
I had to try tail scale

43:22.580 --> 43:27.220
It was pretty cool based on alex's explanation. But now that I tried it, it's even cooler

43:27.460 --> 43:31.780
They make it super easy to set up. I think i've been setting up wire guard for weeks

43:31.780 --> 43:34.580
But this well this just takes care of all of it for me

43:34.980 --> 43:38.500
I have it installed on my phone kabuntu desktop and my linode server

43:38.660 --> 43:43.940
I plan on installing it on my o droid running in armbian and i'm planning on setting up some kind of sync thing

43:44.900 --> 43:49.460
We'll see but so far. I am super ecstatic. Thank you so much for your mention of tail scale

43:50.180 --> 43:56.180
And chris glad you made it back to washington alex. I hope you're enjoying the motherland sincerely erno from virginia

43:56.180 --> 44:01.540
I think I weigh at least 90 of fish and chips now good for you having been back here for a month

44:01.940 --> 44:04.980
That's what I do, too. I'd have to fish and chips and curry

44:05.460 --> 44:09.940
So taylor writes in thanks so much for the amazing show that is self-hosted every two weeks

44:10.020 --> 44:12.260
I'm refreshing my podcatcher like a madman

44:12.660 --> 44:17.460
I was just catching up on episode 54 and could relate to alex's remote access woes

44:17.860 --> 44:21.080
Tail scale is a solution that seems to be popular on reddit and irc

44:21.080 --> 44:26.840
But I wanted to mention something that has been working really well for me and that is zero tier

44:27.240 --> 44:32.920
Now zero tier is a distributed wan solution that essentially creates a global overlay network

44:33.480 --> 44:35.480
Kind of like nebula does

44:35.640 --> 44:37.640
It's open source and self-hostable

44:38.040 --> 44:41.640
With nas packages third party web management guis and so on

44:42.120 --> 44:44.360
They just released a dns solution as well

44:44.680 --> 44:48.440
Which sounds very similar to the tail scale magic dns offering?

44:48.440 --> 44:52.440
And I just wanted to give you guys another self-hosted option. Thanks for the show

44:52.920 --> 44:54.840
I definitely want to give head scale a try

44:54.840 --> 45:00.040
that's why i'm kind of waiting to replace nebula with tail scale is I want to see how

45:00.440 --> 45:05.560
Viable it is to use head scale and uh self-host the server component of tail scale

45:05.640 --> 45:10.440
But that also looks really great. It does there's so many options. I just had to give a plug for nebula, too

45:11.000 --> 45:13.480
now the only thing about zero tier that

45:13.480 --> 45:17.880
Kind of gives me it's just a one or two percent pause

45:18.200 --> 45:24.840
Is that the protocol is custom whereas the tail scale protocol is based around wire guard. So

45:25.640 --> 45:30.120
I mean who's to say one is better than the other but uh, I love me some wire guard

45:30.600 --> 45:33.320
If I were a betting man, alex, I know which one I would bet on

45:33.800 --> 45:40.520
It's not it's not one that's been made up. Uh, I really I respect the wire guard project immensely

45:40.520 --> 45:45.960
So that's just clearly like the one I would put my trust in if my data was was truly critical

45:46.280 --> 45:47.560
I want to mention uh, thank you

45:47.560 --> 45:50.920
Everybody who went to self-hosted dot show slash contact and sent in their question

45:51.000 --> 45:55.240
We also have the discord community self-host dot show slash discord, which is always popping off

45:55.800 --> 46:01.000
And our matrix community is also growing. There's a good conversation of self-hosters going on

46:01.240 --> 46:05.000
You can find our matrix server. We have a jupiter broadcasting dot com matrix server and

46:05.480 --> 46:08.200
Probably the easiest way to just get like a quick guide

46:08.200 --> 46:12.120
Is to actually go to linux unplugged dot com slash matrix. I haven't put that up anywhere else yet

46:12.680 --> 46:17.720
But there is a community growing out there in matrix land of self-hosters. Oh chris. What have you done?

46:17.720 --> 46:25.000
You've invited another set of notifications into my life. Thank you so much. Oh, oh, I know alex. I know so well

46:26.200 --> 46:33.080
But you know i'm i'm trying to assemble the troops because i'm so close to getting this automation bliss where

46:33.080 --> 46:38.200
You know, my my goal is to make it so my wife no longer has to worry about blowing

46:38.760 --> 46:42.520
A 15 amp circuit if we have a heater going and she wants to run the toaster

46:42.840 --> 46:47.880
I want home assistant to figure it out and I know uh, like our guest matt and others out there have done this

46:47.880 --> 46:49.560
But I could use some wisdom

46:49.560 --> 46:52.120
So the matrix server is a great spot to let me know

46:52.200 --> 46:57.720
Because i'm i'm trying to drop in on the matrix from time to time the discord's also really great or telegram

46:58.200 --> 47:00.920
How have you solved this particular problem? What should I do?

47:00.920 --> 47:06.520
And will my z-wave devices update fast enough because it seems like there's sometimes like a 20 second lag

47:07.000 --> 47:08.440
All these things show your wisdom

47:08.440 --> 47:12.280
Let's get this energy monitoring figured out because I think this is going to be big in the self-hosting community

47:12.680 --> 47:17.560
And as always I want to give a big thank you to our sre subscribers. You make this show possible

47:18.120 --> 47:23.960
You can go to self-hosted. Show slash sre to support the show and you can find us on twitter

47:24.040 --> 47:28.920
Alex is over there at ironic badger. I'm at chris las and the show at self-hosted show

47:28.920 --> 47:35.020
At self-hosted show and as usual, thanks for listening everybody. That was self-hosted. Show slash 55
