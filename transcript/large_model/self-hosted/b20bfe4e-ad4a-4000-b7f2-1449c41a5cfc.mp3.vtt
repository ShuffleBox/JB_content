WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
Coming up on the show, I discover a networking miracle.

00:03.480 --> 00:07.440
Alex has been playing with electrics and we review the wise cam three.

00:07.920 --> 00:10.680
I'm Chris and I'm Alex, and this is self-hosted.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.320
Well, this is a bit of a low hanging fruit, isn't it?

00:14.400 --> 00:17.320
I remember a time before Google,

00:17.880 --> 00:19.920
and that was what it was like this morning, wasn't it?

00:22.320 --> 00:23.720
That's where you're going with that.

00:23.720 --> 00:24.400
Oh, yeah, right.

00:24.400 --> 00:27.840
Because as we record this, Google had itself a bit of an outage.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.520
They experienced a system outage

00:29.520 --> 00:33.520
that was due to an internal storage quota issue, according to Google.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.160
So Google ran out of storage.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.680
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.320
Yeah. Then, you know, it wasn't what more than a month ago

00:40.320 --> 00:44.160
that there was a big outage with Amazon when one of their

00:44.160 --> 00:46.000
just one of their regions went out.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.960
More is reluctant to say cloud bad, local good.

00:48.960 --> 00:54.360
But, you know, sometimes it is it is nice to wake up to these notifications.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.800
You know, you see on Twitter and stuff, people losing their minds

00:56.800 --> 01:00.480
and you're like, oh, um, I didn't even notice.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.520
Well, this is why I think it's good to have a little balance.

01:03.520 --> 01:05.640
I mean, you and I have a very balanced approach to it.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.720
It's you have a little bit of here, you have a little bit of there

01:07.720 --> 01:11.240
and you have a little bit of knowledge, maybe across several clouds, too,

01:11.240 --> 01:12.720
if you're going to cloud host.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.960
So that way, not one outage takes you out.

01:14.960 --> 01:18.200
But, you know, there's nothing you can really do other than educate yourself,

01:18.200 --> 01:21.520
which is why this episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

01:22.160 --> 01:24.440
You know, this whole tech area moves really fast,

01:24.440 --> 01:25.720
so you need to keep up to date.

01:25.720 --> 01:28.160
It's sort of just the way it works, and that's what ACG does.

01:28.160 --> 01:32.120
Their courses and labs are always online and obsessively updated.

01:32.120 --> 01:35.120
And they curate all the news on AWS, Kubernetes, Linux and more.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.920
So stay up to date at a cloud guru dot com.

01:37.920 --> 01:43.000
And it's why I've opted to move some of our storage here offline at the studio.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.840
I have more and more that I store at the studio

01:45.840 --> 01:48.800
and more and more services that we run on premises than ever before.

01:48.800 --> 01:54.360
And even this that you this tool that you and I are using to communicate

01:54.360 --> 01:57.320
once the session is established, it's peer to peer.

01:57.320 --> 02:01.920
And the tool you and I are using to write code EMD is self-hosted.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.440
It's up on a cloud server that we control that we self-host.

02:05.440 --> 02:09.280
Yeah, the downside is when all those alerts start firing,

02:09.280 --> 02:10.560
it's you that has to fix them.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.680
I've said this many times.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.840
Yes, that is the downside of self-hosting.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.960
Absolutely. It is absolutely that.

02:15.960 --> 02:20.120
And then the more people that you have using it, the more stressful that gets.

02:20.120 --> 02:23.240
That's why I kind of really like my home network,

02:23.240 --> 02:29.040
because it's it's this knowable problem with a set limit on users

02:29.040 --> 02:32.720
and a set limit on severity of everything.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.520
Right. So if there's an outage for a day, it's OK.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.760
We'll just we'll get by.

02:37.760 --> 02:40.800
You know, it's funny is this week I've been doing hardware shuffles in my house.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.280
I've been rebuilding servers and moving hard drives around

02:44.280 --> 02:46.440
between different cases and boxes and stuff.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.640
It was really as a consequence of the Helios review,

02:49.640 --> 02:54.200
realizing that device wasn't going to be suitable for my main NAS.

02:54.200 --> 02:59.040
I bought a U-NAS chassis off of eBay for 125, I think.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.560
It takes eight three and a half inch drives.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.240
So I've been moving stuff around all week.

03:03.240 --> 03:06.480
And I didn't want to have Plex online whilst I did that,

03:06.480 --> 03:11.240
so that libraries didn't index stuff that was missing and things like that.

03:11.240 --> 03:15.240
And I got it back up last night after about five or six days.

03:15.240 --> 03:18.040
And Catherine went, oh, I've really missed this.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.920
Yeah, I would definitely miss it if there was an outage.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.160
That's for sure.

03:22.160 --> 03:27.640
But it is a different scale of severness, I guess is what I'm thinking.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.840
But it was still kind of even with that.

03:29.840 --> 03:36.400
I just recently completed kind of a rechange of my home server set up in Lady Joops.

03:36.400 --> 03:41.800
Yeah, I saw on Instagram you've got like a sexy LED home server

03:41.800 --> 03:43.320
covered going on now, right?

03:43.320 --> 03:45.440
Well, previously on Self Hosted Alex.

03:45.440 --> 03:49.440
You remember when I was talking about my upgraded LTE system,

03:49.440 --> 03:51.640
and there was one component that still had to get wired in,

03:51.640 --> 03:54.240
and that was the antenna that goes externally.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.440
And so when I talked about it last time on the show,

03:56.440 --> 04:00.280
I was using an antenna array that was internal to the RV.

04:00.280 --> 04:05.040
And I have this seven in one that is on the roof that does all these great things.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.440
But it needed to be completely wired in.

04:07.440 --> 04:11.480
And where I wanted to wire it in, I was not comfortable drilling myself

04:11.480 --> 04:15.640
because it was where some wiring has been done for the solar panel.

04:15.640 --> 04:18.560
So really wanted to be careful and have an expert's eye on it.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.880
And I brought it into the shop.

04:19.880 --> 04:22.360
I waited because they were super busy.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.720
I bring it into the shop.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.360
And he says, we can't drill there.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.440
He looks at he says, yeah, we can't drill there.

04:28.440 --> 04:32.440
And I was a little devastated because this spot that I had

04:32.440 --> 04:34.560
was where I was going to move everything,

04:34.560 --> 04:37.440
because those who have been listening for a while know that over the summer

04:37.440 --> 04:41.120
when I traveled to Texas, I had severe thermal issues

04:41.120 --> 04:43.280
with where I had put all my server gear.

04:43.280 --> 04:48.000
And I have identified a new spot that would be perfect.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
It's ventilated. It's got power.

04:50.000 --> 04:54.240
And if I could just bring the antenna in right there, it would have been ideal, Alex.

04:54.240 --> 04:59.600
But the problem is that antennas cord length can't be any longer than six feet.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.920
So where that antenna goes, everything else has to go.

05:02.920 --> 05:03.920
What does it plug into?

05:03.920 --> 05:08.120
Is it like an RPSMA on the end of it or essentially it plugs into my router.

05:08.120 --> 05:12.960
The antenna feeds into my router, which is just these small standard antenna connections.

05:12.960 --> 05:13.840
Ethernet, then?

05:13.840 --> 05:15.760
They're common RF coax connectors.

05:15.760 --> 05:20.520
Specifically, these are Jack female and male plugs that come in.

05:20.520 --> 05:25.280
There's like six or seven of them that come in as a bundle

05:25.280 --> 05:27.520
that are all really kind of tightly bundled together

05:27.520 --> 05:31.400
that plug in directly to the back of my PEP Wave router.

05:31.400 --> 05:35.280
OK, so it's like the thing that goes into the back of your cable box or something.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.280
Very similar, right?

05:36.280 --> 05:38.600
Right, and so that means the router has to be there,

05:38.600 --> 05:40.640
which kind of dictates where the switch goes,

05:40.640 --> 05:43.960
which then kind of dictates where the servers go

05:43.960 --> 05:47.920
because I don't want to have my servers connected back to my switch over Wi-Fi.

05:47.920 --> 05:52.920
And it kind of just it's a whole domino effect of where all the equipment goes.

05:52.920 --> 05:58.120
And when this spot that I had really picked out from a thermal solution was going to be perfect.

05:58.120 --> 06:01.800
So when that didn't work out, my my only other spot was was plan B.

06:01.800 --> 06:07.480
And it was up in the driver's cab area where there is some cupboards

06:07.480 --> 06:12.560
that get very hot, Alex, like a like a pizza oven.

06:12.560 --> 06:17.640
So we we wrecked a pair of headphones by leaving them in there over the summer.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.360
Like they just disintegrated the plastic.

06:20.360 --> 06:24.280
Oh, no, I really didn't want to put the antenna in this spot.

06:24.280 --> 06:27.000
But when you look at the wiring and what's available and the distances

06:27.000 --> 06:31.160
it needs for metal objects on the roof and all the solar panels I have up there,

06:31.160 --> 06:34.680
which I didn't consider this problem when I went all solar crazy.

06:34.680 --> 06:37.040
I had to put it up in this front cab and that's where it just had to go.

06:37.040 --> 06:41.920
And so so then I had to figure out a way to get enough equipment in this cupboard

06:41.920 --> 06:45.280
that could be maybe somehow have a chance of succeeding.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.120
I knew I couldn't put the raspberry pies in there, though.

06:48.120 --> 06:52.240
And after years of research, Alex.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.480
And I'm not kidding you.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.240
I cannot I could not exaggerate this point enough.

06:56.240 --> 07:04.200
I watch four or five to a dozen RV videos a day for the last five years,

07:04.200 --> 07:05.880
literally seven days a week.

07:05.880 --> 07:10.720
I'm a member of several RV community forums, including community forums

07:10.720 --> 07:15.160
that are specifically about mobile data and networking in RVs

07:15.160 --> 07:17.280
that have an eighty dollar a year membership fee.

07:17.280 --> 07:19.760
So we're talking like people who really want to be in this club,

07:19.760 --> 07:25.960
who really are detailed and nowhere ever has anyone ever told me

07:25.960 --> 07:29.800
if power line networking works in an RV.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.560
Those of you who are not familiar with power line networking,

07:32.560 --> 07:36.720
it's essentially a way to transmit data over the power line,

07:36.720 --> 07:38.760
kind of kind of like how DSL works.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.840
It's that over your power line in your house.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.520
And there's certain limitations.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.400
And an RV is certainly no home.

07:45.400 --> 07:49.760
And so because I had never seen anybody ever talk about this,

07:49.760 --> 07:52.720
I assumed it was absolutely impossible.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.480
But I figured I'll give it a go, Alex.

07:54.480 --> 07:58.000
I picked up these TP-Link AV1000 adapters.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.120
Have you ever tried this power line networking stuff?

08:00.120 --> 08:01.080
I did, actually.

08:01.080 --> 08:05.040
And this is when I was a teenager a while ago.

08:05.040 --> 08:08.840
And it was slow and it was fairly reliable.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.920
And it certainly beat running an ethernet cable through brick

08:11.920 --> 08:13.320
and plasterboard walls in England.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.840
But has it gotten better now?

08:15.840 --> 08:20.680
Yes, because the last time I tried it was probably no joke,

08:20.680 --> 08:24.800
probably about 18 years ago, maybe 15 years ago.

08:24.800 --> 08:25.840
It's been a long time.

08:25.840 --> 08:29.880
And I got maybe 8, 10, 11 megabits back then,

08:29.880 --> 08:30.960
if I was lucky.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.560
Funny, I think that's probably exactly the same sort

08:33.560 --> 08:35.440
of time frame, 15, 18 years ago.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.280
They kind of just had their moment back then

08:37.280 --> 08:39.240
because Wi-Fi wasn't really reliable.

08:39.240 --> 08:42.000
They faded after Wi-Fi got so popular.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
I remember struggling with Wi-Fi drivers on Windows XP.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.400
I think that was what drove me to power line ethernet.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.160
Right, well, and remember the early stuff

08:49.160 --> 08:52.040
was only like 11 megabits in the home, which was just not

08:52.040 --> 08:55.360
even enough to stream videos to the Xbox or something.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.160
So that's what I started using it for,

08:57.160 --> 08:59.520
was to connect whatever I was using back then

08:59.520 --> 09:02.400
as a media server to my Xbox that was either hacked

09:02.400 --> 09:06.680
or just trying to use DLNA or something to play video.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.120
And it was just enough back then.

09:09.120 --> 09:13.160
But in the intervening years, they've kept at it.

09:13.160 --> 09:16.720
And I think TP-Link is one of the standout companies

09:16.720 --> 09:17.440
in this area now.

09:17.440 --> 09:20.360
And I've been happier and happier with TP-Link

09:20.360 --> 09:22.560
since I got their KASA devices.

09:22.560 --> 09:25.920
And they just integrated so easily into Home Assistant.

09:25.920 --> 09:28.120
And so when I saw TP-Link was in this market,

09:28.120 --> 09:29.760
they were one of the first I looked at.

09:29.760 --> 09:33.160
And I picked up an AV1000 kit.

09:33.160 --> 09:35.240
Now, on the box, it claims it's going

09:35.240 --> 09:39.200
to get you 1,000 megabits.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.380
I don't know, maybe.

09:41.380 --> 09:42.760
I don't know if that's possible.

09:42.760 --> 09:45.560
Maybe if nothing else is plugged in, I'm not sure.

09:45.560 --> 09:49.280
But I'd have been happy with a good solid 100 megabits.

09:49.280 --> 09:55.120
Because what I decided to do was put the router, a switch,

09:55.120 --> 09:57.960
a couple of items that I need for my POE

09:57.960 --> 10:01.160
gear for the junkyard that's POE, which I can talk about more

10:01.160 --> 10:02.120
in a bit.

10:02.120 --> 10:02.920
And that's about it.

10:02.920 --> 10:04.040
I got a really small switch.

10:04.040 --> 10:07.520
I got a really cheap TP-Link gigabit switch.

10:07.520 --> 10:08.660
I installed them all.

10:08.660 --> 10:12.680
They all have to be really well held down because it's moving.

10:12.680 --> 10:17.760
So I installed them all using this industrial grade Velcro

10:17.760 --> 10:21.760
on top of a large laptop cooling fan.

10:21.760 --> 10:24.600
So the router and the switch and the POE gear

10:24.600 --> 10:27.880
have air blowing on them from this laptop cooling fan.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.800
And then we drilled ventilation holes

10:29.800 --> 10:32.580
underneath and in the back of the cab

10:32.580 --> 10:35.600
so it can draw air and exit air to hopefully get

10:35.600 --> 10:36.920
a little bit of airflow going.

10:36.920 --> 10:39.160
I'm going to actually add a fan to the exit hole,

10:39.160 --> 10:40.660
but I just haven't done it yet.

10:40.660 --> 10:43.040
And then the POE adapter sits in there,

10:43.040 --> 10:46.200
and it connects back to the booth where I have now

10:46.200 --> 10:48.760
a reduced Raspberry Pi load.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.840
And I've split up some of the Wi-Fi and the internet

10:51.840 --> 10:54.000
connectivity gear from the server gear,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.120
and I've linked them up over POE.

10:56.120 --> 10:59.320
And it worked out of the box in the RV.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.200
They just immediately saw each other.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.760
I had zero configuration.

11:03.760 --> 11:07.160
Plug one in, plug the other one in, boom, they're online.

11:07.160 --> 11:10.520
And I'm getting 300 megabits transfer rate between them.

11:10.520 --> 11:11.600
That's perfect.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.680
It's great, Alex.

11:12.680 --> 11:13.400
It's great.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.320
And so it means now I can spread out the load.

11:16.320 --> 11:19.240
And I would really appreciate any experience

11:19.240 --> 11:22.440
the audience has with these power line adapters.

11:22.440 --> 11:25.640
What happens if I add another one?

11:25.640 --> 11:26.920
What happens if I add two more?

11:26.920 --> 11:28.400
Do I have to add them in pairs?

11:28.400 --> 11:29.200
How does that work?

11:29.200 --> 11:31.740
Because what I was thinking is that original spot

11:31.740 --> 11:34.520
that I had thought would work really well for the servers,

11:34.520 --> 11:36.440
if I could spread things out a little bit,

11:36.440 --> 11:39.360
I could maybe put a power line adapter in there

11:39.360 --> 11:42.240
and set some stuff up in that original spot

11:42.240 --> 11:44.080
I was thinking of that would have been so great,

11:44.080 --> 11:45.600
take advantage of the cooling there,

11:45.600 --> 11:47.880
and connect it all together with power line networking.

11:47.880 --> 11:52.000
But I really don't want to have an impact on the performance.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.320
And looking at the way the technology works,

11:54.320 --> 11:57.360
it seems like any more traffic you put on the power line,

11:57.360 --> 11:58.800
it will reduce performance.

11:58.800 --> 12:03.320
But are we talking by 50% or are we talking 5%?

12:03.320 --> 12:04.600
It's just not clear to me.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.360
And it's not really clear to me if it

12:06.360 --> 12:08.560
has to be done in pairs or what.

12:08.560 --> 12:12.440
So it feels a little bit like black magic.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.720
It feels like I stumbled onto something

12:14.720 --> 12:16.760
that no one in the RV community is talking about.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.520
This is a fundamental game changer

12:18.520 --> 12:25.040
for networking in a van or other, a bus or an RV.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.520
As far as I'm concerned, this changed my life.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.680
And I'm not kidding you.

12:28.680 --> 12:29.680
This changed my life.

12:29.680 --> 12:34.200
Because before today, I was a I'll always

12:34.200 --> 12:37.360
have to be Wi-Fi in my RV guy.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.840
And I don't like that.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.480
I don't like it for media playback.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.400
I don't like it for connecting servers back

12:42.400 --> 12:44.920
to routers and switches.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.240
I want a wired backhaul.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.240
I always have.

12:47.240 --> 12:50.480
It's maybe because I've been doing this forever.

12:50.480 --> 12:54.520
This means even if in small quantities I can have that,

12:54.520 --> 12:57.840
it's going to forever change how I have my home set up forever.

12:57.840 --> 12:58.640
It's so great.

12:58.640 --> 13:01.040
And they're the TP-Link AV1000s.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.160
They claim a gigabit.

13:02.160 --> 13:05.400
At least in my setup, I'm getting 300 megabits.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.800
And when I thought through the way that electrical works

13:07.800 --> 13:10.160
in the RV, it seems obvious.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.560
Because the way the electrical done

13:11.560 --> 13:13.960
is pretty much like a traditional house that

13:13.960 --> 13:16.200
goes back to a fuse panel, a box.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.840
And then that goes down to the Victron system,

13:18.840 --> 13:20.360
where the solar is at.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.480
So I'm delighted.

13:21.480 --> 13:24.240
I put all that together in this cupboard.

13:24.240 --> 13:27.560
And then I did, because this is the self-hosted podcast,

13:27.560 --> 13:30.600
I had to put an Aotech multi-sensor in there

13:30.600 --> 13:34.840
so I could monitor the temperature of the cupboard.

13:34.840 --> 13:38.800
Because it's a glass cupboard, it's got a see-through glass,

13:38.800 --> 13:43.320
I decided to put some LED light strips in there.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.880
And I made it, at least for a little bit,

13:45.880 --> 13:47.280
it was rotating rainbow colors.

13:47.280 --> 13:49.320
So that way the family would see it and remember

13:49.320 --> 13:52.000
what an awesome setup dad built for them.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.680
And it just was really cool in Star Trek.

13:53.680 --> 13:56.040
But now what I've done is it's just a nice glow.

13:56.040 --> 14:01.400
And then when the cupboard reaches 85 degrees or higher,

14:01.400 --> 14:05.760
the LED light strip will come on with a bright red.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.000
And it'll glow red.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.840
The cupboard will start glowing red because it's very bright.

14:09.840 --> 14:11.960
And that'll be a visual indicator that the cupboard's

14:11.960 --> 14:14.440
getting too hot, which I won't have to worry about now

14:14.440 --> 14:16.560
because it's the middle of winter.

14:16.560 --> 14:17.920
But in the summer.

14:17.920 --> 14:19.040
Idea for you.

14:19.040 --> 14:24.600
When you open the door, you have the Star Trek door noise play

14:24.600 --> 14:26.480
through Alexa or something.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.760
That'd be awesome to add some sound effects.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.200
It's really pretty great.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.520
It works super solid.

14:31.520 --> 14:33.760
I've even had a chance to take it out into the woods

14:33.760 --> 14:36.760
last week and test the entire setup,

14:36.760 --> 14:38.560
the automatic cellular switch over.

14:38.560 --> 14:42.200
And Alex, if it wasn't perfect, it

14:42.200 --> 14:46.240
became perfect when I actually experienced an outage.

14:46.240 --> 14:50.600
AT&T's tower just went out, just went offline.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.560
But the bonded VPN setup that I have through this router

14:54.560 --> 14:56.000
never missed a beat.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.200
I was on a call when it happened.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.600
And it was a Wi-Fi call.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.800
And it stayed connected.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.080
It just switches over to Verizon, and then it manages.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.560
And then when AT&T came back on 10 minutes later,

15:07.560 --> 15:09.640
it just integrated it right back.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.000
It was perfect.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.120
The whole thing worked exactly like I wanted.

15:13.120 --> 15:17.200
We spent five days off grid in the woods

15:17.200 --> 15:19.800
with about an 80 megabit cellular connection.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.040
It was a little bit slower than last time

15:22.040 --> 15:25.400
because we went down a little bit further into the canyon.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.160
But it was great, Alex.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.520
It was so perfect.

15:28.520 --> 15:31.400
It really felt like I had reached the peak

15:31.400 --> 15:36.240
technological point, where we have the Home Assistant doing

15:36.240 --> 15:38.360
the automation, and we have the PEP Wave doing

15:38.360 --> 15:39.640
the cellular routing.

15:39.640 --> 15:42.240
The backbone of it is this power line networking

15:42.240 --> 15:46.800
that links the server switch to the telco switch.

15:46.800 --> 15:49.240
All of the in-house streaming is just

15:49.240 --> 15:50.960
working so good to the TVs.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.280
Everything is really humming along right now.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.280
Important question, then.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.840
When are you going to come and see me?

15:55.840 --> 15:56.600
Yeah, I know.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.420
Well, I guess I'm better to come down there

15:58.420 --> 15:59.960
when it's warm so I can put it all

15:59.960 --> 16:01.640
through the thermal testing.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.240
Oh, the other thing I've got to consider

16:03.240 --> 16:04.760
is, do I want to drill another hole

16:04.760 --> 16:05.680
in the side of the cupboard?

16:05.680 --> 16:07.600
This is a spot where you can see it.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.520
I'll put a link to the pictures in the show notes

16:09.520 --> 16:11.960
so everybody can visualize what I'm talking about.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.840
Do I want to drill a hole and run an ethernet cable

16:13.840 --> 16:14.720
through there?

16:14.720 --> 16:16.560
Because I've got this extension cable,

16:16.560 --> 16:21.880
and I run PoE out to a WISP antenna at my home base.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.040
And it just, I don't know what to do with it.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.600
I just, I hate to drill a hole somewhere like that where

16:26.600 --> 16:28.240
you can see it.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.160
And I'm not very good with that kind of stuff.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.360
So right now, I just kind of have

16:31.360 --> 16:33.520
running through the door with the door slightly cracked,

16:33.520 --> 16:35.680
and then the cord comes into the PoE adapter.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.280
Oh, yeah, because that looks better.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.960
Yeah, I know.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.800
It's just not permanent, so it's like, I haven't committed.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.440
Get yourself a 3D printer, drill a hole,

16:44.440 --> 16:47.520
and then print a custom cable grommet for it.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.160
Ooh, that sounds really fancy.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.760
You're right, I do need to come visit.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.280
I'll come down there, and we'll work on that.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.240
lino.com slash SSH.

16:55.240 --> 16:58.400
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account,

16:58.400 --> 17:00.280
and you go there to support the show.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.940
It's our cloud hosting provider.

17:01.940 --> 17:04.160
When I mentioned earlier that I had a bonded VPN,

17:04.160 --> 17:05.840
I set that up on Linode.

17:05.840 --> 17:08.520
And unlike entry-level hosting services

17:08.520 --> 17:10.200
that lock you into their platform,

17:10.200 --> 17:11.840
Linode gives you full back-end access

17:11.840 --> 17:14.320
to customize and control the server to fit your needs.

17:14.320 --> 17:17.480
So I followed a guide to reimage and set up

17:17.480 --> 17:22.720
a Linode with a custom OS that PepWave uses, or PepLink uses,

17:22.720 --> 17:26.640
for this bonded VPN that combines multiple LTE connections

17:26.640 --> 17:27.400
together.

17:27.400 --> 17:31.240
And what's super nice is I can support multiple Linodes.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.080
So I can spin up one in multiple areas,

17:33.080 --> 17:36.320
and then I can have up to three that all are participating

17:36.320 --> 17:37.880
in this bonded VPN.

17:37.880 --> 17:41.240
And because Linode's prices start at $5 a month,

17:41.240 --> 17:45.520
this is significantly less than what the company PepWave,

17:45.520 --> 17:48.520
or PepLink, whoever, would charge to host this.

17:48.520 --> 17:51.220
Their price, I'm not kidding you, is $100 a month,

17:51.220 --> 17:53.720
and that has a ridiculous data cap on it.

17:53.720 --> 17:56.800
So when you look at what you can do at Linode for $5 a month,

17:56.800 --> 17:58.300
it just was the obvious way to go,

17:58.300 --> 18:00.440
and it just took me 15, 20 minutes.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.960
I followed a guide and got it done.

18:02.960 --> 18:06.440
But you can do one-button deployments.

18:06.440 --> 18:09.240
One time, I was trying out different WordPress setups

18:09.240 --> 18:11.420
to see which was fastest, because Linode has what's

18:11.420 --> 18:14.000
called the stack scripts, where you can deploy

18:14.000 --> 18:16.160
different applications on different distributions.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.040
You're not stuck to one distribution.

18:18.040 --> 18:21.760
And so they had ones that were like WordPress sitting

18:21.760 --> 18:24.280
on top of a web server that runs out of RAM,

18:24.280 --> 18:26.720
and WordPress that sits on top of NGINX,

18:26.720 --> 18:29.040
and WordPress that sits on top of Apache.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.400
So I was like, well, let's just see what

18:31.400 --> 18:33.480
it's like to use all of them.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.200
And so I deployed one of each, one at a time,

18:36.200 --> 18:38.880
and just tested each one out for a website I was building,

18:38.880 --> 18:40.800
and then I picked the one that worked best for me.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.680
And it's great like that, because then you just

18:42.680 --> 18:45.280
destroy the machines you don't need, and you're good to go.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.360
And when you get $100 credit, you've got a lot to work with

18:48.360 --> 18:49.880
here, because like I'm saying, those prices are great.

18:49.880 --> 18:53.480
So make sure you go to linode.com slash SSH

18:53.480 --> 18:56.280
to get that $100 60-day credit towards your new account.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.000
You support the show, you get the credit,

18:58.000 --> 18:59.600
you can do some really fun stuff.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.520
And the great thing about Linode is they've been around

19:01.520 --> 19:02.840
forever, they know how to do this.

19:02.840 --> 19:05.140
They started before AWS, they followed the tech,

19:05.140 --> 19:07.120
they figured out where it was going,

19:07.120 --> 19:09.440
and they were driven by a passion.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.960
And I think maybe you get why that matters.

19:10.960 --> 19:15.960
So try them out, linode.com slash SSH.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.900
Okay, power usage time.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.080
I promised this last week.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.640
And again, this is a follow-up almost,

19:21.640 --> 19:23.760
or kind of, to the Helios stuff.

19:23.760 --> 19:27.700
So we're talking in the Discord with King Hat, actually,

19:27.700 --> 19:30.680
I think his username is, about the power usage

19:30.680 --> 19:32.080
of the Helios and things like that.

19:32.080 --> 19:35.480
And in last week's episode, I proclaimed it was 30 watts

19:35.480 --> 19:38.000
at full load, no matter what you did.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.520
But I've done a little bit more testing

19:39.520 --> 19:41.200
and a bit more detail and compared it

19:41.200 --> 19:46.200
to my dual Xeon setup, an i5-8500, and the Helios.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.360
So here we go.

19:49.360 --> 19:53.120
The Helios is, of course, an ARM base CPU.

19:53.120 --> 19:57.240
So low idle power draw is its bread and butter,

19:57.240 --> 19:58.600
you would think, wouldn't you?

19:58.600 --> 20:01.360
I would hope, that'd be maybe number one reason

20:01.360 --> 20:02.200
I'm buying it.

20:02.200 --> 20:05.300
Uh-huh, so 14 watts at idle.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.040
So what I did, I did a 10-minute average

20:07.040 --> 20:10.960
with one of my smart plugs, it has metering built in,

20:10.960 --> 20:15.220
and I used Home Assistant to measure a 10-minute average,

20:15.220 --> 20:17.320
rolling average of each of these numbers

20:17.320 --> 20:18.160
you're about to hear.

20:18.160 --> 20:22.560
So the Helios was 14 watts, no hard drives or anything,

20:22.560 --> 20:25.840
just idle, running at bone stock, Debian install,

20:25.840 --> 20:27.520
that was all it was doing, just,

20:27.520 --> 20:28.900
there was no services running, nothing.

20:28.900 --> 20:33.080
Plugged into the network, SSH'd in, and that was it.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.800
Running HTOP, I think.

20:34.800 --> 20:36.720
Brilliant that you thought to test at baseline

20:36.720 --> 20:39.280
without the disk, that's a great idea.

20:39.280 --> 20:43.760
And so then I thought, hmm, I've got an i5-8500 CPU here

20:43.760 --> 20:46.440
with my Blue Iris box.

20:46.440 --> 20:50.180
So why don't I do the same test with that?

20:51.080 --> 20:52.840
23 watts.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.560
So we're talking a nine watt difference

20:54.560 --> 20:59.480
between an i5-8500 and the Helios 64.

20:59.480 --> 21:03.800
And there is a significant, to sound like you there,

21:03.800 --> 21:07.560
significant difference between the two

21:07.560 --> 21:09.300
in terms of capabilities.

21:09.300 --> 21:10.600
Well, yeah, that's a good way to put it

21:10.600 --> 21:12.160
because it's not just performance, is it?

21:12.160 --> 21:14.320
It's also compatibility.

21:14.320 --> 21:15.320
Absolutely.

21:15.320 --> 21:19.600
And so then for giggles, I did my dual Xeon system as well.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.120
And that one, as you would expect, was atrocious.

21:22.120 --> 21:26.080
140 watts idle, so 10 times the Helios.

21:26.080 --> 21:27.000
Yeah, that's bad.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.440
That said, the dual Xeon did have 128 gigs of RAM in there,

21:30.440 --> 21:32.540
so that might have contributed to it.

21:32.540 --> 21:35.080
Again, all of these systems had no hard drives connected.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.400
It was literally just bare minimum,

21:37.400 --> 21:40.720
minimum viable system to get these numbers.

21:40.720 --> 21:44.400
So then I did a full load, 10-minute average

21:44.400 --> 21:47.560
using STUI, S2E, something we've covered

21:47.560 --> 21:49.600
on LAP previously, I think.

21:49.600 --> 21:54.560
And so the Helios, and again, no drives, 20 watts.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.000
So you went from 14 to 20 at full load.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.740
So the CPU's only drawing six watts

21:59.740 --> 22:02.480
is what we can conclude from that, I think.

22:02.480 --> 22:03.960
When it's under full load.

22:03.960 --> 22:08.220
The i5 jumped up to 93 watts,

22:08.220 --> 22:10.840
but the dual Xeon, 410.

22:12.480 --> 22:15.560
Geez, that's like running a kitchen appliance, practically.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.120
Yeah, it's legit.

22:17.120 --> 22:20.440
And you think about the requirements that that creates.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.080
I have a UPS in my basement.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.960
So when I moved here a couple of years ago,

22:24.960 --> 22:27.720
I accidentally ordered the backup battery,

22:27.720 --> 22:31.680
like additional battery, instead of the UPS part itself.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.080
Oh, I've done that once.

22:33.080 --> 22:34.920
And so I went to return it to Amazon and I said,

22:34.920 --> 22:36.740
oh no, keep it, it's too expensive to return.

22:36.740 --> 22:38.640
It's hazardous materials or something.

22:39.520 --> 22:43.360
And so I ordered the actual UPS part and connected that in.

22:43.360 --> 22:44.640
And so I've got like a half an hour,

22:44.640 --> 22:47.040
40-minute runtime on three, 400 watts,

22:47.040 --> 22:51.960
but it's noisy when the fan starts spinning in the UPS.

22:51.960 --> 22:52.800
You can hear it.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.240
You wouldn't want it in the house.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.200
And so when you've got like a 400 watt load

22:56.200 --> 22:59.760
going through it, you have to size everything accordingly.

22:59.760 --> 23:04.320
So you've got Helios at 20, i5 at 90,

23:04.320 --> 23:07.120
and the Dual Xeon at 410 watts.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.360
Big difference.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.680
Now, what I thought would be interesting to do

23:11.680 --> 23:14.080
would be to add some hard drives into the mix.

23:14.080 --> 23:18.400
So I added eight drives because the i5 CPU

23:18.400 --> 23:19.840
I put in the UNAZ chassis,

23:19.840 --> 23:22.260
which has eight three and a half inch bays.

23:23.120 --> 23:24.800
The Helios only takes five, of course.

23:24.800 --> 23:28.560
So take these numbers with a little bit of a grain of salt,

23:28.560 --> 23:33.560
but the Helios with five drives was 51 watts at idle,

23:34.560 --> 23:35.880
which was higher than I was expecting,

23:35.880 --> 23:37.320
to be honest with you.

23:37.320 --> 23:39.960
One watt of 24 seven operation

23:39.960 --> 23:42.320
costs approximately a dollar per year.

23:42.320 --> 23:45.920
That's how I tend to think of it to run.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.520
So 50 watts is 50 bucks a year.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.720
Now the i5 system was 98 watts.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.960
So twice what the Helios does,

23:53.960 --> 23:57.520
but I would argue way more than twice as capable.

23:57.520 --> 24:02.440
But the interesting thing is that the Xeon system

24:02.440 --> 24:06.580
was only 185 watts with all those drives connected.

24:06.580 --> 24:11.580
So the eight drives in the Xeon system added 45 watts

24:12.280 --> 24:13.840
to the overall system.

24:13.840 --> 24:17.100
Whereas with the i5 system, for some reason,

24:17.100 --> 24:20.760
it added like 65, 70 watts.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.080
It just didn't make sense to me.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.060
So I ran the test again

24:23.060 --> 24:24.680
and came up with the same numbers three times.

24:24.680 --> 24:27.080
So it must be correct.

24:27.080 --> 24:32.080
But with the Helios five drives added about 35 watts or so.

24:32.120 --> 24:35.280
So it's just an interesting little experiment.

24:35.280 --> 24:36.120
Yeah, it is.

24:36.120 --> 24:36.940
It's interesting.

24:36.940 --> 24:39.480
So you think of it in terms of total cost annually,

24:39.480 --> 24:40.560
power consumption.

24:40.560 --> 24:45.160
And I think of it as how many hours does that shave off

24:45.160 --> 24:46.880
my ability to run off of batteries?

24:46.880 --> 24:48.280
That's always the math I'm doing.

24:48.280 --> 24:53.280
And that is a super high cost because less battery time

24:53.380 --> 24:56.400
sometimes means I stay at an area less,

24:56.400 --> 24:58.480
which means I can maybe work less

24:58.480 --> 25:00.680
and I have to pack up and move everything

25:00.680 --> 25:03.160
and bring the slides in sooner.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.080
So it has a pretty high cost for me.

25:05.080 --> 25:05.920
Yeah.

25:05.920 --> 25:10.920
So sometimes my baseline is how low can I get the power draw

25:11.680 --> 25:14.460
and can it do the core job I need it to do?

25:14.460 --> 25:16.160
But I like to go a little bit above that.

25:16.160 --> 25:18.720
And I feel like that's where the Raspberry Pis are for me.

25:18.720 --> 25:22.400
And I, you know, what are they 15 watts, 20 watts, those?

25:22.400 --> 25:24.040
I should have tested a Pi.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.000
I'm kicking myself for not doing that now.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.080
Maybe next time.

25:27.080 --> 25:28.640
But here's where it gets really interesting

25:28.640 --> 25:30.760
is when you wanna start transcoding video.

25:30.760 --> 25:31.680
Yes, right.

25:31.680 --> 25:34.440
This is for me, primarily a media server.

25:34.440 --> 25:39.440
So Plex is gonna be the primary creator of heat,

25:40.160 --> 25:43.640
of noise, of electricity consumption and stuff like that.

25:43.640 --> 25:46.280
But this seems like an area where probably the Intels

25:46.280 --> 25:48.080
would probably clearly have an advantage.

25:48.080 --> 25:48.920
Yeah, absolutely.

25:48.920 --> 25:51.180
So the Helios 64, I didn't even bother

25:51.180 --> 25:54.560
because I started trying to do a 4K transcode

25:54.560 --> 25:57.280
and it was just a full load and after eight minutes,

25:57.280 --> 26:00.120
the 4K stream hadn't even started playing.

26:00.120 --> 26:04.160
So I just gave up with the Helios.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.080
Fail.

26:05.080 --> 26:07.120
I know 4K transcoding is a torch test,

26:07.120 --> 26:09.600
but that's kind of the point of this exercise, right?

26:09.600 --> 26:12.600
You know, my philosophy is try to get the best quality

26:12.600 --> 26:16.800
you can and then downstream it to devices for compatibility

26:16.800 --> 26:19.640
because your screens are only gonna get better over time.

26:19.640 --> 26:22.840
And, you know, I know a friend who back when HD

26:22.840 --> 26:25.880
was coming along, he said it was too much storage

26:25.880 --> 26:27.360
to capture the HD versions.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.760
I'm just gonna capture the standard definition.

26:29.760 --> 26:30.960
They're fine.

26:30.960 --> 26:33.400
And now his entire collection looks like total garbage,

26:33.400 --> 26:36.340
right, and he's watching off of my Plex server.

26:36.340 --> 26:37.680
Yep.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.680
And so then I did a 4K.

26:40.680 --> 26:44.160
So this was a 4K high bit rate file.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.500
I'd actually downloaded it from YouTube with YouTube DL.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.080
It was one of the Costa Rica things.

26:48.080 --> 26:51.660
So it was a constant file.

26:51.660 --> 26:53.880
And I down sampled it, I guess,

26:53.880 --> 26:58.120
or transcoded it to 720p at two megabytes per second.

26:58.120 --> 27:01.760
So down from like a 40 or 50 megabit a second down to two.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.960
So I was doing quite a lot of processing.

27:03.960 --> 27:08.960
Now with the i5 at, this is software transcoding only.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.200
This was with no drives connected by the way,

27:12.200 --> 27:13.700
just a little bit confusing,

27:13.700 --> 27:16.160
but this was before I put the drives in.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.680
i5, 75 Watts.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.800
The dual Xeon, 304.

27:21.800 --> 27:25.960
So the dual Xeon was a lot more performant than the i5.

27:25.960 --> 27:29.160
The stream started playing after only eight seconds

27:29.160 --> 27:32.640
instead of about 15 or 16 with the i5,

27:32.640 --> 27:36.960
but at a more than three times the energy cost.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.680
Hmm, so that'd be an area probably

27:38.680 --> 27:41.480
where I'd be willing to take that compromise.

27:41.480 --> 27:45.780
Now the Xeon CPUs don't have quick sync.

27:45.780 --> 27:48.240
And this is where the real magic happens.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.720
The i5 does.

27:49.720 --> 27:52.300
And this is the entire reason I selected this CPU.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.700
Do you want to take a guess

27:54.700 --> 27:59.180
at what a 4K transcode with quick sync drew?

27:59.180 --> 28:02.440
We were at 75 with software, 75 Watts.

28:02.440 --> 28:03.280
70, okay.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.680
So we're at 75 Watts of software,

28:04.680 --> 28:08.600
quick sync being the CPU accelerated encoder,

28:08.600 --> 28:11.120
decoder in the Intel CPU.

28:11.120 --> 28:13.960
Yes, for H.264 content.

28:13.960 --> 28:17.240
So idle is 23 Watts, transcode is 75.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.760
Where do you think quick sync put us?

28:18.760 --> 28:20.640
I'm going to say 60 Watts.

28:20.640 --> 28:24.000
Wrong, 35.

28:24.000 --> 28:24.840
Whoa.

28:24.840 --> 28:28.120
Quick sync was using 12 Watts to do this.

28:28.120 --> 28:29.040
Game changer.

28:29.040 --> 28:32.520
That is huge, huge, huge game changer.

28:32.520 --> 28:33.560
Mm-hmm.

28:33.560 --> 28:34.800
Absolutely phenomenal.

28:34.800 --> 28:39.120
And to top that off, the performance matched the Xeon.

28:39.120 --> 28:42.060
So it started playing in nine seconds instead of 16.

28:42.060 --> 28:43.400
Oh, that is faint.

28:43.400 --> 28:46.400
Did you have to do any finagling to get quick sync working?

28:46.400 --> 28:47.480
Because it sounds like you tested it

28:47.480 --> 28:49.280
in both on and off modes.

28:49.280 --> 28:52.080
No, so Plex, you need Plex Pass

28:52.080 --> 28:54.500
to enable hardware transcoding.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.180
I run my Plex in a container, of course.

28:57.180 --> 29:00.240
I use the Linux server one, obviously.

29:00.240 --> 29:05.240
And you pass through the device, so slash dev slash DRI

29:06.000 --> 29:11.000
and check the hardware encoding box

29:11.200 --> 29:14.680
in the settings of Plex and you're good to go, that's it.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.820
Well, I may be picking your brain on that

29:16.820 --> 29:19.920
because thanks to JDM's recommendation from Server Builds,

29:19.920 --> 29:24.040
I picked up a ThinkPad, IdeaPad on a Black Friday sale

29:24.040 --> 29:28.120
for $150 and it has an i5 with quick sync in it.

29:28.120 --> 29:32.240
And I'm just in the process of slowly upgrading it

29:32.240 --> 29:34.480
because I had to order it apart from Alibaba.

29:34.480 --> 29:37.400
And so I'm just kind of putting it all together

29:37.400 --> 29:39.800
thinking if I replace the PIs,

29:39.800 --> 29:41.240
this is what I replace it with.

29:41.240 --> 29:44.320
And I would love to get access to quick sync.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.800
Now, you're running it native on the host,

29:46.800 --> 29:49.320
so it's not like through a VM, is quick sync available?

29:49.320 --> 29:50.780
Well, I was for the testing,

29:50.780 --> 29:53.300
but then when I wanted to move it into production,

29:53.300 --> 29:57.440
I decided to put Proxmox on the UNAZ box

29:57.440 --> 29:59.920
that the new NAS I'm building.

29:59.920 --> 30:03.080
I looked into PCI pass through of the Intel GPU

30:03.080 --> 30:06.200
in order to give the VM access to quick sync

30:06.200 --> 30:08.920
and then you could pass that through to the container.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.920
Some people will think I'm mad for running a container

30:10.920 --> 30:13.280
in a VM when I could just run the container

30:13.280 --> 30:15.160
on the native host, but whatever.

30:15.160 --> 30:16.520
That's what I choose to do.

30:17.520 --> 30:19.600
Enjoy it, deal with it.

30:19.600 --> 30:20.440
I kind of like it.

30:20.440 --> 30:22.160
I mean, it's a lot of layers of snapshots

30:22.160 --> 30:23.680
and backups and recovers.

30:23.680 --> 30:24.840
Yeah, it is.

30:24.840 --> 30:29.840
Now, the coolest thing is something called Intel GVT-G.

30:31.560 --> 30:35.400
Snappy name, but awesome, awesome thing you can do here.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.580
So this is kind of like the SRIOV stuff

30:37.580 --> 30:39.480
that Wendell's been banging on about

30:39.480 --> 30:41.480
on his YouTube channel for the last few weeks

30:41.480 --> 30:45.760
with asking Nvidia to create virtual GPUs

30:45.760 --> 30:47.760
that you can pass through to VMs.

30:47.760 --> 30:51.880
So using the Intel GPU built into your CPU,

30:52.800 --> 30:57.120
I've passed that virtual GPU through to the VM

30:57.120 --> 30:59.560
and then given the Plex Docker container

30:59.560 --> 31:01.780
access to that virtual GPU.

31:01.780 --> 31:04.420
So what this means is PCI pass through used to be,

31:04.420 --> 31:07.480
you'd have to have one GPU per VM,

31:07.480 --> 31:10.200
but with this virtual GPU slice,

31:10.200 --> 31:12.520
I can have three or four VMs

31:12.520 --> 31:15.720
all hooked into that quick sync hardware.

31:15.720 --> 31:18.520
So what I'm gonna try over the next couple of weeks

31:18.520 --> 31:21.320
is running Blue Iris in a VM as well

31:21.320 --> 31:25.120
and using the quick sync hardware for Plex

31:25.120 --> 31:26.960
and Blue Iris at the same time.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.500
Awesome, and does Proxmox give you the UI

31:29.500 --> 31:30.460
to do this pass through,

31:30.460 --> 31:32.760
or is this a command line thing you had to do?

31:32.760 --> 31:33.600
How'd that work?

31:33.600 --> 31:36.680
It's command line, but the documentation is really great.

31:36.680 --> 31:39.520
If you've got any familiarity with kernel parameters

31:39.520 --> 31:42.600
and grub and passing that kind of stuff,

31:42.600 --> 31:45.120
it's pretty easy to be honest with you.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.320
If you don't, feel free to hit me up in the Discord.

31:47.320 --> 31:48.920
This is something I'm really, really,

31:48.920 --> 31:50.940
it's what got me interested in Linux in the first place

31:50.940 --> 31:52.000
was PCI pass through.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.760
So I'd be happy to help anybody get this sorted.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.280
I know Unraid makes it easy

31:57.280 --> 31:58.860
to pass that stuff through through the GUI,

31:58.860 --> 32:00.880
but I don't mind Drop.

32:00.880 --> 32:03.800
It would be nice if Proxmox just had that built in,

32:03.800 --> 32:07.040
but if it's doable at all, that gives me hope

32:07.040 --> 32:10.200
because that's how I want to base my next setup as well.

32:10.200 --> 32:11.480
I don't know if I'm gonna do it

32:11.480 --> 32:15.240
because I mean, what I have now is working really well.

32:15.240 --> 32:18.560
And I feel like there's more and more people out in the world

32:18.560 --> 32:20.440
that are trying to build things on Raspberry Pis.

32:20.440 --> 32:24.320
I see it all the time in the Home Assistant forums

32:24.320 --> 32:27.840
and on the various different Home Lab Reddits and whatnot

32:27.840 --> 32:30.600
that people are trying these Raspberry Pis out.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.480
And I feel like in a way, it's sort of beneficial

32:32.480 --> 32:34.880
to be there and talking about it here on the show.

32:34.880 --> 32:35.840
But at the same time, like,

32:35.840 --> 32:39.200
I wonder if I could take two or three Raspberry Pis,

32:39.200 --> 32:40.420
I only have two running at the moment,

32:40.420 --> 32:45.420
and consolidate it all down to one ThinkPad with QuickSync,

32:46.400 --> 32:50.060
all based on Proxmox, I'd really like the way,

32:50.060 --> 32:51.840
I'd like how solid that is, you know?

32:51.840 --> 32:53.920
And then it's got the crash cart built in

32:53.920 --> 32:55.640
if anything goes wrong.

32:56.560 --> 32:57.720
I was astonished, honestly.

32:57.720 --> 32:59.240
I put together this spreadsheet

32:59.240 --> 33:01.120
and I couldn't believe my eyes.

33:01.120 --> 33:02.280
35 watts.

33:02.280 --> 33:05.780
So you want to offset when you're buying this stuff,

33:05.780 --> 33:09.360
at idle, I'm saving approximately $100 a year

33:09.360 --> 33:11.520
over my Jouelzeon setup.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.720
And when it's doing transcoding and stuff like that,

33:13.720 --> 33:15.660
the energy usage is minimal.

33:15.660 --> 33:19.980
So instead of doing a 300 watts burst for a few minutes,

33:19.980 --> 33:22.800
it's doing a 35 watt burst for a few minutes, you know?

33:22.800 --> 33:23.640
So-

33:23.640 --> 33:24.460
Huge, that's huge.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.080
I think over a year,

33:26.080 --> 33:29.560
I'm probably going to save 100 to $150 or so,

33:29.560 --> 33:31.180
which, you know, starts to pay for this.

33:31.180 --> 33:32.600
This used gear off eBay,

33:32.600 --> 33:34.260
I think I paid 100 for the CPU,

33:34.260 --> 33:36.920
100 for the motherboard and 100 for the case.

33:36.920 --> 33:39.640
So in three years, it will pay for itself approximately.

33:39.640 --> 33:41.320
So that's kind of the lesson, isn't it?

33:41.320 --> 33:43.040
Like having gone through the whole gamut,

33:43.040 --> 33:44.160
because I've seen your setup,

33:44.160 --> 33:47.440
it's an impressive server grade setup.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.440
You're now kind of on the other end of it going,

33:49.440 --> 33:50.840
okay, now after I've done that,

33:50.840 --> 33:53.240
I think I'm going to go more consumer grade with my hardware

33:53.240 --> 33:55.600
and maybe I even prefer it.

33:55.600 --> 33:58.520
What enabled it, and we talked about this in LUP last week,

33:58.520 --> 34:00.700
was the Pi KVM project.

34:00.700 --> 34:05.700
So now I can get BMC, IPMI grade remote access

34:06.240 --> 34:09.000
to the system when I'm not in front of it using the Pi.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.520
So that was like the final missing piece

34:11.520 --> 34:12.680
of the jigsaw for me.

34:12.680 --> 34:13.800
Yeah, obligatory plug.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.720
You should check out that episode of Unplugged

34:16.720 --> 34:20.000
because it was pretty cool Pi KVM setup.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.400
Not the like virtualization KVM, no, no.

34:22.400 --> 34:25.400
We're talking about the keyboard video mouse kind of KVM.

34:25.400 --> 34:26.400
You remember those?

34:26.400 --> 34:28.280
Episode 383, by the way.

34:28.280 --> 34:29.120
Ah, there you go.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.040
I was just looking for it.

34:31.040 --> 34:34.600
Yes, 383, Murder of a Distro, where Alex covers that.

34:34.600 --> 34:37.660
But I think there's just one obvious conclusion

34:37.660 --> 34:39.920
from all of this, which I don't think you've touched on yet.

34:39.920 --> 34:40.760
What's that?

34:40.760 --> 34:42.660
Well, you clearly need to buy an Apple M1 device

34:42.660 --> 34:45.800
to compare and contrast the power draw to performance now.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.400
Oh no, you've triggered half the audience.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.840
They're fed up of hearing about the Apple stuff now.

34:49.840 --> 34:50.840
Ha ha ha ha.

34:52.160 --> 34:53.720
Well, let's take a moment and thank

34:53.720 --> 34:57.660
an unofficial official sponsor of the show, Cloudfree.shop.

34:57.660 --> 34:59.160
This is a member of our community,

34:59.160 --> 35:02.080
and they've done exactly what I always hoped somebody would do,

35:02.080 --> 35:05.280
and that is create a super easy to use store that

35:05.280 --> 35:08.280
sells devices that are already disconnected from the cloud

35:08.280 --> 35:12.060
and just work over your LAN with things like Home Assistant.

35:12.060 --> 35:14.960
There's a series of smart plugs, so if you're looking at setting

35:14.960 --> 35:16.960
up something for the holidays, or you've

35:16.960 --> 35:20.400
heard me talk about how I have some outdoor Wi-Fi and Z-Wave

35:20.400 --> 35:24.280
devices, Cloudfree.shop has a outdoor smart plug,

35:24.280 --> 35:26.000
a weatherproof outdoor smart plug

35:26.000 --> 35:29.240
with two plugs pre-flashed with Tasmota.

35:29.240 --> 35:33.640
Ready to go, 15 amps per plug, has overvoltage and overheating

35:33.640 --> 35:35.920
protection, and I don't know how he's making any money

35:35.920 --> 35:37.600
because he only charges $20.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.200
I bought the same plug off Amazon

35:39.200 --> 35:43.640
before he had that for $35, so there you go.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.400
It also has the Aqua button, which

35:45.400 --> 35:49.640
is a $16 little Z-Wave device that you can join to your network

35:49.640 --> 35:52.160
and then you hit that button to trigger an automation.

35:52.160 --> 35:55.040
For my use, it would be to set light scenes or something

35:55.040 --> 35:56.120
like that.

35:56.120 --> 35:57.560
There's different ones that are Z-Wave and Zigbee,

35:57.560 --> 35:58.400
so you check them out there.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.800
But have you dug around to anything

35:59.800 --> 36:00.920
that looks good to you, Alex?

36:00.920 --> 36:01.480
I have, yeah.

36:01.480 --> 36:05.480
I ordered a couple of the smart plugs from Cloudfree.shop,

36:05.480 --> 36:07.920
and they're just so easy to set up.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.280
They arrive in the box.

36:09.280 --> 36:11.060
You take them out, plug them in.

36:11.060 --> 36:13.720
They broadcast a Wi-Fi network, so this is just

36:13.720 --> 36:15.680
standard Tasmota setup because they

36:15.680 --> 36:17.960
come pre-flashed with Tasmota.

36:17.960 --> 36:20.640
And you connect to the Wi-Fi network on your phone,

36:20.640 --> 36:23.400
put in your Wi-Fi credentials, and then it just

36:23.400 --> 36:24.880
appears on the network.

36:24.880 --> 36:28.920
You can then log into the web UI, which all Tasmota devices

36:28.920 --> 36:33.920
have, set up in QTT, advertise it to connect to Home Assistant,

36:33.920 --> 36:36.520
and bada-bing, bada-boom, you're good to go.

36:36.520 --> 36:37.680
Magic.

36:37.680 --> 36:42.480
He also has those nice metal gentleman NFC tags over there

36:42.480 --> 36:44.200
that we've talked about before on the show,

36:44.200 --> 36:49.480
as well as an even cheaper $0.50 NFC tag, cloudfree.shop.

36:49.480 --> 36:52.000
And when you check out coupon code self-hosted,

36:52.000 --> 36:53.160
you may get something off.

36:53.160 --> 36:53.520
I don't know.

36:53.520 --> 36:56.040
It's really just to kind of support a community member

36:56.040 --> 36:57.560
and let them know we sent you.

36:57.560 --> 36:59.800
Like I said, it's an unofficial official sponsor,

36:59.800 --> 37:05.680
and we're really happy to see them grow, cloudfree.shop.

37:05.680 --> 37:09.440
So whilst we're on the topic of home automation, sort of,

37:09.440 --> 37:11.560
was the Home Assistant conference this weekend?

37:11.560 --> 37:13.000
Yeah, it was a big deal.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.160
They had some ridiculous amount of people

37:16.160 --> 37:18.280
get tickets for this thing.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.480
And they used a pretty decent platform

37:20.480 --> 37:25.240
to get a kind of like conference experience,

37:25.240 --> 37:27.480
where you had a reception area, and you

37:27.480 --> 37:30.200
had different speaking rooms, and each room had chat areas.

37:30.200 --> 37:32.600
It was very easy to navigate.

37:32.600 --> 37:35.800
Probably the best UI I have seen yet.

37:35.800 --> 37:36.840
I think it's called Hoppin.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.680
Just H-O-P-I-N was the platform.

37:38.680 --> 37:40.200
And one of the better ones.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.800
How many of these virtual conferences

37:41.800 --> 37:43.280
have you attended this year, Alex?

37:43.280 --> 37:47.280
I've got fatigue, half a dozen or so.

37:47.280 --> 37:49.760
So what happens is I put them on YouTube, a live stream

37:49.760 --> 37:52.600
or whatever, and then there's a couple of speakers

37:52.600 --> 37:55.400
that start buffering, or something goes wrong,

37:55.400 --> 37:57.840
and then I lose interest, and I go and do something else.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.600
Yeah, they're rough, right?

37:59.600 --> 38:01.520
I have watched a lot.

38:01.520 --> 38:03.880
And I know you weren't as big of a fan,

38:03.880 --> 38:08.320
but this was, as far as these virtual conferences go,

38:08.320 --> 38:10.520
I think one of the better ones, honestly,

38:10.520 --> 38:14.440
from both the experience of participating and attending.

38:14.440 --> 38:17.040
I even connected with a speaker who

38:17.040 --> 38:20.400
had a talk on his off-grid bus.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.480
So obviously, that was a talk I was interested in.

38:22.480 --> 38:26.120
And he and I are going to communicate and collaborate

38:26.120 --> 38:27.440
on what we're doing for our rigs.

38:27.440 --> 38:28.760
And I'm going to maybe even invite him

38:28.760 --> 38:31.120
on one of the shows, maybe this show, in the future.

38:31.120 --> 38:32.160
And that was really great.

38:32.160 --> 38:35.040
So I actually even had that conference-like experience

38:35.040 --> 38:37.040
where that was one of the things I love about going,

38:37.040 --> 38:38.920
is I would network and meet people,

38:38.920 --> 38:40.640
and then convert them into guests,

38:40.640 --> 38:43.800
or maybe even one day co-hosts, right?

38:43.800 --> 38:45.160
Yeah, who would that be?

38:45.160 --> 38:47.560
So this is the first one out of all the virtual conferences

38:47.560 --> 38:49.640
I attended that actually facilitated that.

38:49.640 --> 38:53.160
And they really tried to make it a little bit better.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.520
The participants really had their stuff together.

38:55.520 --> 38:58.280
I think everybody had done an audio and mic check.

38:58.280 --> 39:01.480
So it was rough, because it's a virtual conference.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.060
But as far as virtual conferences goes,

39:03.060 --> 39:05.200
it was one of the better ones I attended.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.860
I'll put a link to it in the show notes.

39:06.860 --> 39:08.600
But there's some big news announced,

39:08.600 --> 39:09.840
as far as Home Assistant goes.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.840
They announced their first hardware device,

39:11.840 --> 39:13.880
which we knew this was coming, but we just

39:13.880 --> 39:16.440
didn't know when it would actually show up.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.720
It's Home Assistant Blue.

39:18.720 --> 39:19.880
You ordered one, didn't you?

39:19.880 --> 39:20.360
I did.

39:20.360 --> 39:23.920
I was, you know what?

39:23.920 --> 39:25.520
I'm not even kidding.

39:25.520 --> 39:29.480
I tell you what, I was looking at the Odroid N2 Plus,

39:29.480 --> 39:32.840
thinking to myself, you know, if this laptop doesn't work out,

39:32.840 --> 39:34.840
maybe this is the route I go.

39:34.840 --> 39:38.000
Because it's got pretty good performance.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.320
I know that the developers, the Home Assistant developers,

39:40.320 --> 39:42.240
have talked about how they like it before.

39:42.240 --> 39:45.600
It has eMMC instead of SD cards.

39:45.600 --> 39:49.320
So what they've announced is $140 all-in-one device

39:49.320 --> 39:54.660
with a blue logoed metal chassis in a case

39:54.660 --> 39:58.200
with a essential plug-and-play kind of pitch for this device.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.000
What's special about the Odroid?

40:00.000 --> 40:01.280
Was it N2 Plus?

40:01.280 --> 40:04.480
Yeah, the N2 Plus, it's a six-core CPU,

40:04.480 --> 40:07.560
so you've got a lot of processing power there.

40:07.560 --> 40:11.280
It has a decent amount of USB, while also

40:11.280 --> 40:12.640
still having gigabit.

40:12.640 --> 40:16.060
And I think that eMMC is just, it's faster,

40:16.060 --> 40:19.160
it's more reliable, it lasts longer.

40:19.160 --> 40:22.080
So I think when you look at it compared to the Raspberry Pi 4,

40:22.080 --> 40:24.200
it's kind of a bit of a better candidate.

40:24.200 --> 40:29.240
Although the Pi 4 with USB disk, it's a pretty good contender

40:29.240 --> 40:30.760
too, because it's so well-supported.

40:30.760 --> 40:33.560
It has such a network effect and ecosystem.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.240
Interesting, I'll be really curious to take

40:35.240 --> 40:36.200
your thoughts on that.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.360
The chassis, like the case of it, looks pretty cool.

40:38.360 --> 40:39.880
You can swap the lid around.

40:39.880 --> 40:41.560
Yeah, and I want to support them.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.040
I like what they're doing.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.480
You know, this kind of stuff, it feeds directly back

40:45.480 --> 40:50.000
into the project, kind of why I'm now just comfortably

40:50.000 --> 40:51.600
playing for Nebuchadnezzar Cloud,

40:51.600 --> 40:56.120
because it's paying for now eight full-time developers.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.640
Well, eight full-time staff members,

40:57.640 --> 40:59.100
some of which are developers, that

40:59.100 --> 41:00.720
are working on Home Assistant.

41:00.720 --> 41:03.320
And their incentive is to make Home Assistant better.

41:03.320 --> 41:07.680
And it is a value for value that I can recognize

41:07.680 --> 41:08.760
and I'm comfortable with.

41:08.760 --> 41:11.120
They're not getting the value from my information.

41:11.120 --> 41:14.160
They're not getting value from selling ad placements

41:14.160 --> 41:18.160
or special gold standard integrations in Home Assistant.

41:18.160 --> 41:21.680
They're getting value by making Home Assistant better

41:21.680 --> 41:24.760
and getting more people to use it, who then subscribe

41:24.760 --> 41:27.120
to Nebuchadnezzar Cloud, who then pay them,

41:27.120 --> 41:29.080
and then they continue to develop.

41:29.080 --> 41:30.320
And I like that.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.960
You can't see me, but I'm nodding.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.400
And I think it's a really great way

41:33.400 --> 41:36.080
to kind of give back to the project in a way that

41:36.080 --> 41:38.840
gets you something with the remote access

41:38.840 --> 41:44.120
portion and the lady cylinder integrations that they have.

41:44.120 --> 41:47.200
But the important thing is that it's a choice.

41:47.200 --> 41:51.240
It's not when you buy a product that comes with a subscription,

41:51.240 --> 41:53.680
you have to pay it in order to continue using the thing

41:53.680 --> 41:55.080
that you've purchased.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.880
With Home Assistant, I'm choosing

41:56.880 --> 41:59.360
to support the project because I want to.

41:59.360 --> 42:02.360
And I think that's a key difference.

42:02.360 --> 42:03.080
Yes, well put.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.120
Thank you.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.800
OK, so they also announced a new versioning system

42:06.800 --> 42:07.840
for Home Assistant Core.

42:07.840 --> 42:11.920
That's the core application that Home Assistant

42:11.920 --> 42:14.040
is built around with Supervisor.

42:14.040 --> 42:16.000
It's the version you can install just via Docker.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.360
Home Assistant Core is now using calendar versioning.

42:20.360 --> 42:24.760
So they're basically at the 1.0, but instead of just going 1.0,

42:24.760 --> 42:27.800
which they are doing 1.0 with the beta just to have fun,

42:27.800 --> 42:30.840
the date will now consist of the year, month, and patch number

42:30.840 --> 42:33.240
to indicate the bug fix level.

42:33.240 --> 42:36.560
They're also, along with that, changing the release cadence

42:36.560 --> 42:37.440
a little bit.

42:37.440 --> 42:40.000
So Home Assistant Core will now be released every first

42:40.000 --> 42:41.680
Wednesday of the month.

42:41.680 --> 42:44.360
So it essentially goes from a three-week release cadence

42:44.360 --> 42:46.160
to a four-week release cadence.

42:46.160 --> 42:48.040
I do get a bit tired of the updates, though,

42:48.040 --> 42:51.080
like every three or four weeks or whatever,

42:51.080 --> 42:54.320
having to press that button and then clench a little bit

42:54.320 --> 42:55.280
as it does the upgrade.

42:55.280 --> 42:56.080
Do you know what I mean?

42:56.080 --> 42:57.860
Yeah, and that's where the numbers kind of start

42:57.860 --> 43:00.640
to mean nothing, too, and maybe where the dates will make

43:00.640 --> 43:02.860
a little more sense because you'll look at it and go,

43:02.860 --> 43:04.600
I'm only a week behind, no big deal.

43:04.600 --> 43:06.920
Or you'll go, oh, this install's a year behind.

43:06.920 --> 43:08.400
It'll be a lot more clear now.

43:08.400 --> 43:10.200
Yeah, I do hope that they find a way

43:10.200 --> 43:13.160
to solve the stuff changing all the time.

43:13.160 --> 43:17.040
Like, I was messing around earlier on the terminal

43:17.040 --> 43:20.560
of the HA, I think I'm running Hass OS,

43:20.560 --> 43:24.760
and they have this command line client of HA something.

43:24.760 --> 43:26.800
And it said, HA is now deprecated.

43:26.800 --> 43:28.080
Please use core.

43:28.080 --> 43:30.720
I'm like, oh, something else has changed.

43:30.720 --> 43:34.560
Yeah, I can imagine with,

43:34.560 --> 43:37.080
because if you look at the market they're addressing

43:37.080 --> 43:40.320
and how much work it is to really do all of this,

43:40.320 --> 43:42.420
it's such a high velocity task.

43:42.420 --> 43:44.000
It's gonna be a lot of change for a while,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.720
and that's why I have been gravitating more

43:46.720 --> 43:50.480
towards a Proxmox setup that is then running an OS

43:50.480 --> 43:52.240
with this running inside a container.

43:52.240 --> 43:55.280
Or maybe I run their custom OS inside a Proxmox

43:55.280 --> 43:58.160
that I can snapshot there, and I can also snapshot

43:58.160 --> 44:00.560
using Supervisor in Home Assistant.

44:00.560 --> 44:01.880
Because of this very reason, Alex,

44:01.880 --> 44:06.480
because it is so core to the function of my home right now

44:06.480 --> 44:10.200
that I can't stand the idea of something going wrong

44:10.200 --> 44:11.280
because of one of these updates.

44:11.280 --> 44:14.680
So that's why I'm gravitating towards virtualization.

44:14.680 --> 44:16.960
They also announced automation blueprints.

44:16.960 --> 44:18.480
This is huge.

44:18.480 --> 44:21.360
So an automation blueprint is a pre-created automation

44:21.360 --> 44:23.560
with user-settable options.

44:23.560 --> 44:26.640
I have needed this since I've started using Home Assistant.

44:26.640 --> 44:29.680
You separate out the logic and the inputs of an automation.

44:29.680 --> 44:32.200
So the trigger and what happens can be separated out.

44:32.200 --> 44:34.680
So imagine a blueprint that controls a light

44:34.680 --> 44:37.240
based on motion that allows you to configure

44:37.240 --> 44:40.360
the motion sensor to trigger on and the light to control.

44:40.360 --> 44:42.120
It's now possible to create two automations

44:42.120 --> 44:45.120
that each have their own configuration for this blueprint

44:45.120 --> 44:46.920
and act completely independently,

44:46.920 --> 44:50.080
yet are based on the same automation configuration,

44:50.080 --> 44:52.980
and then you can share that blueprint with other people.

44:52.980 --> 44:54.860
So these blueprints are shareable.

44:54.860 --> 44:57.440
I love this because I sometimes have devices

44:57.440 --> 45:00.760
that come and go, and so I'd like to keep the trigger series

45:00.760 --> 45:03.040
but have what it triggers and what lights turn on and off

45:03.040 --> 45:05.840
or devices outside be able to change.

45:05.840 --> 45:06.800
So this is really cool.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.320
And blueprints make it a little bit easier

45:08.320 --> 45:11.280
to kind of just get started, have a base logic,

45:11.280 --> 45:12.760
and then share that with people.

45:12.760 --> 45:14.440
So if you had a really easy,

45:14.440 --> 45:17.280
like pretty basic system that you liked,

45:17.280 --> 45:19.640
and then you just save it off for yourself

45:19.640 --> 45:20.920
or send it to somebody.

45:20.920 --> 45:22.160
When they mention blueprints,

45:22.160 --> 45:24.320
well, I think of this Factorio, so.

45:24.320 --> 45:25.920
It does kind of make you think of that.

45:25.920 --> 45:27.440
There's actually a lot of other stuff in there.

45:27.440 --> 45:30.400
So just a couple other small ones, really quick.

45:30.400 --> 45:32.560
They now have better non-Google voices

45:32.560 --> 45:35.000
via Nebuchadnezzar Home Assistant Cloud,

45:35.000 --> 45:38.160
and they say, in their words, stunning quality.

45:38.160 --> 45:39.360
Haven't tried them myself.

45:39.360 --> 45:41.360
I'll be the judge of that, thank you, darling.

45:41.360 --> 45:42.240
Yeah, exactly right.

45:42.240 --> 45:44.320
Whether it's stunning or not.

45:44.320 --> 45:45.960
And then another thing that's landed,

45:45.960 --> 45:47.520
and amongst a bunch of other stuff,

45:47.520 --> 45:49.560
but another thing that caught my attention,

45:49.560 --> 45:51.160
Home Assistant will now have the ability

45:51.160 --> 45:53.000
to temporarily disable devices,

45:53.000 --> 45:56.240
which imagine you set up some lighting for the holiday,

45:56.240 --> 45:57.960
you take them down, you can now disable them

45:57.960 --> 46:00.360
and then re-enable them when it's time to put them back up.

46:00.360 --> 46:01.480
It's great for guys like me

46:01.480 --> 46:04.520
who have outdoor devices at my home base when I leave.

46:04.520 --> 46:07.360
Right now, they're just like broken and offline.

46:07.360 --> 46:09.080
And I really wish I could just go in

46:09.080 --> 46:10.440
and toggle them off while I'm gone

46:10.440 --> 46:11.600
and then toggle them back on.

46:11.600 --> 46:13.920
And wouldn't it be great if I could even automate that?

46:13.920 --> 46:15.400
So that's now in there as well.

46:15.400 --> 46:16.640
Very neat, yeah.

46:16.640 --> 46:18.400
I mean, overall, I thought it was a good conference.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.760
Lots of interesting news came out of it.

46:20.760 --> 46:24.280
And yeah, good job, guys, overall, well done.

46:24.280 --> 46:26.720
All right, at the risk of overrunning, Chris,

46:26.720 --> 46:30.320
you got a new camera in the mail this week.

46:30.320 --> 46:32.280
Big episode this week, Alex.

46:32.280 --> 46:33.200
Huge. Big episode.

46:33.200 --> 46:34.840
Huge. Yep.

46:34.840 --> 46:38.560
I got my Wyze 3Cam, just got it set up last night.

46:38.560 --> 46:40.400
So this is my first impressions.

46:41.480 --> 46:43.480
But this is a $19.99,

46:43.480 --> 46:48.120
I mean, $19.99 Wi-Fi camera when you buy it direct.

46:48.120 --> 46:50.240
So we're talking about a $20 camera here

46:50.240 --> 46:51.800
I'm about to tell you about.

46:51.800 --> 46:54.960
And no cloud subscription, no monthly subscription

46:54.960 --> 46:57.040
for any of the basic features.

46:57.040 --> 47:00.760
You do need the cloud connection to use their app

47:00.760 --> 47:04.240
and set some of the settings and whatnot,

47:04.240 --> 47:06.840
unless they release an RTSP firmware.

47:06.840 --> 47:10.080
There is not an RTSP firmware for it at this time yet.

47:10.080 --> 47:11.600
Does have an SD card slot.

47:11.600 --> 47:13.720
So you could pop a micro SD in there

47:13.720 --> 47:16.960
and do a little local video recording, no cloud required.

47:16.960 --> 47:19.560
And now the thing that's new about the Wyze 3

47:19.560 --> 47:22.440
is it's now an indoor or outdoor camera.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.880
Lots of people are using their Wyze cams as outdoor

47:24.880 --> 47:26.200
because you know, 20 bucks,

47:26.200 --> 47:27.920
you could buy a handful of these things,

47:27.920 --> 47:29.880
put them all over your yard on your Wi-Fi.

47:29.880 --> 47:31.480
I have like eight, nine of these things

47:31.480 --> 47:32.920
cause I have them for the studio.

47:32.920 --> 47:35.080
I have them all over the RV.

47:35.080 --> 47:38.960
And so I'm pretty familiar with the Wyze 2 camera.

47:38.960 --> 47:41.880
So this is, it's a nicer looking camera.

47:41.880 --> 47:45.520
It has that kind of cutesy Wyze look, but it's more refined.

47:45.520 --> 47:48.360
They put a little rubber booty over the power plug,

47:48.360 --> 47:51.120
which is now, it has a tail cable

47:51.120 --> 47:53.760
that has a female adapter that you plug

47:53.760 --> 47:56.760
the same USB micro adapter into.

47:56.760 --> 47:59.360
So that if you've run any power lines like I have,

47:59.360 --> 48:02.400
your power will still work for these cameras,

48:02.400 --> 48:05.560
but it is now, it plugs into this little tail,

48:05.560 --> 48:08.200
which means I'll have to redo some of my wire management.

48:08.200 --> 48:10.240
But that little tail has that rubber booty,

48:10.240 --> 48:11.560
which keeps it dry.

48:11.560 --> 48:14.120
So if you put it outside, you're good to go.

48:14.120 --> 48:16.600
It has the same versatile mounting options

48:16.600 --> 48:18.440
that the version two had, so you can screw it in.

48:18.440 --> 48:20.760
It comes with a really nice little tripod

48:20.760 --> 48:22.120
that it sits on that it can pivot on,

48:22.120 --> 48:24.360
but also you can magnetically mount it,

48:24.360 --> 48:26.040
which is what I've done.

48:26.040 --> 48:28.560
So this is extremely nice for me

48:28.560 --> 48:32.160
because I can just literally pop the version two off

48:32.160 --> 48:34.960
the old magnetic mount and pop version three on.

48:34.960 --> 48:38.760
And I've just significantly upgraded my cameras.

48:38.760 --> 48:40.880
It has a better two-way speaker.

48:40.880 --> 48:42.680
So you can actually do two-way conversations

48:42.680 --> 48:44.320
with people a little more clear now,

48:44.320 --> 48:47.680
but the significant big upgrade for the version three

48:47.680 --> 48:50.440
has gotta be the much wider field of view.

48:50.440 --> 48:53.480
So I could actually cover more area with less cameras now.

48:53.480 --> 48:56.080
It has 130 degree field of view.

48:56.080 --> 48:59.240
And the night performance, which I have not tested yet,

48:59.240 --> 49:02.160
I can update you later if people are interested,

49:02.160 --> 49:04.160
but it's reported to be amazing.

49:04.160 --> 49:06.360
On their website, they say it's capable of seeing

49:06.360 --> 49:09.920
in color at night with very limited lighting.

49:09.920 --> 49:12.080
You can even use it to watch the stars

49:12.080 --> 49:13.960
or take a time-lapse of the stars.

49:13.960 --> 49:15.560
And it does have a time-lapse feature.

49:15.560 --> 49:18.520
They refer to it as an all new starlight sensor.

49:18.520 --> 49:20.320
And I must say the pictures on the website

49:20.320 --> 49:21.520
do look very impressive.

49:21.520 --> 49:23.320
So I'll be interested to hear your thoughts.

49:23.320 --> 49:25.160
Yes, I will be testing this soon.

49:25.160 --> 49:27.400
Of course, it's nothing but gray clouds.

49:27.400 --> 49:29.920
You do live in Seattle, bro.

49:29.920 --> 49:31.040
Yeah, yeah.

49:31.040 --> 49:32.560
So it does enroll you in a two-week trial

49:32.560 --> 49:33.720
when you first set up the camera.

49:33.720 --> 49:34.640
So just be aware of that.

49:34.640 --> 49:35.760
It's easy to go through.

49:35.760 --> 49:38.200
The app for me, the Wwise app has been fine,

49:38.200 --> 49:40.080
but this, I had all kinds of issues.

49:40.080 --> 49:43.400
I had weird EULA overlay on top of the UI.

49:43.400 --> 49:45.520
And when I wanted to change Wi-Fi networks,

49:45.520 --> 49:46.640
it was super clunky.

49:46.640 --> 49:48.600
And it made me switch the Wi-Fi network

49:48.600 --> 49:51.680
that my phone was on before I could change the Wi-Fi network

49:51.680 --> 49:53.400
that the camera would go on because I wanted

49:53.400 --> 49:54.400
to just transfer the setting.

49:54.400 --> 49:56.080
The whole thing was that part of it

49:56.080 --> 49:57.680
I was not very impressed with.

49:57.680 --> 49:59.600
And if I have to do this a dozen times over,

49:59.600 --> 50:00.960
it's going to be annoying.

50:00.960 --> 50:03.480
But they do say on their website that they're

50:03.480 --> 50:07.400
planning to release an RTSP firmware for this, which

50:07.400 --> 50:11.120
I will put on there immediately because then it requires

50:11.120 --> 50:12.840
no cloud connectivity.

50:12.840 --> 50:16.480
So this is a $20 camera that you can put an RTSP firmware

50:16.480 --> 50:18.240
on there, and then you can plug it

50:18.240 --> 50:21.080
into something like Shinobi or one of the other applications

50:21.080 --> 50:21.880
that Alex likes.

50:21.880 --> 50:22.640
What was it called?

50:22.640 --> 50:23.120
Blue what?

50:23.120 --> 50:24.360
Sentinel?

50:24.360 --> 50:25.120
Blue Dog?

50:25.120 --> 50:25.760
Blue Iris.

50:25.760 --> 50:26.520
Blue Iris.

50:26.520 --> 50:27.040
OK.

50:27.040 --> 50:28.840
Which has been super solid, by the way.

50:28.840 --> 50:29.520
Yeah.

50:29.520 --> 50:30.760
Sounds like it.

50:30.760 --> 50:34.400
So I'd say for $20, I recommend it with caveats

50:34.400 --> 50:37.000
if you're OK with limited cloud requirements that have

50:37.000 --> 50:38.960
some really nice options.

50:38.960 --> 50:40.800
Like their advanced detection services

50:40.800 --> 50:43.840
that it enrolls you in, it's really good.

50:43.840 --> 50:46.960
And they're adding things like vehicle detection,

50:46.960 --> 50:50.200
package delivery detection, all that,

50:50.200 --> 50:51.960
along with better person detection.

50:51.960 --> 50:54.280
So $20 with optional cloud services,

50:54.280 --> 50:57.240
with a local SD recording, and the company

50:57.240 --> 51:00.600
is committed to an RTSP firmware that you will then

51:00.600 --> 51:02.360
have to use microSD to reflash it.

51:02.360 --> 51:04.480
But once you've done that, it's all yours, my friends.

51:04.480 --> 51:11.440
And I've run the V2s in the studio and LadyJuice 24-7.

51:11.440 --> 51:12.800
And they've been really solid.

51:12.800 --> 51:15.280
They're not always the best little RTSP streamers.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.240
And sometimes I have to reboot them.

51:17.240 --> 51:18.720
But the V3 is a clear upgrade.

51:18.720 --> 51:20.840
And one of the other areas that I

51:20.840 --> 51:24.520
think could be a nice improvement is it has more RAM

51:24.520 --> 51:27.760
and it has a faster CPU on its little SOC.

51:27.760 --> 51:30.440
So it could mean it also is a little better at RTSP

51:30.440 --> 51:33.000
streaming as well, which will be something I'll

51:33.000 --> 51:34.840
test when they release.

51:34.840 --> 51:38.280
When they release that, this is an easy recommended $20.

51:38.280 --> 51:40.080
Well, it's just constantly astonished me

51:40.080 --> 51:41.400
with their price points.

51:41.400 --> 51:44.240
I mean, they've just announced a smartwatch

51:44.240 --> 51:47.160
with over a week's battery life for $20 as well.

51:47.160 --> 51:50.320
So obviously, I've ordered one of those.

51:50.320 --> 51:52.080
Oh, I love to hear how that goes too.

51:52.080 --> 51:55.760
And then maybe if you could plug the data in to Home Assistant.

51:55.760 --> 51:59.480
The Home Assistant iOS developer really knows his stuff.

51:59.480 --> 52:01.520
I have to say, it's remarkable.

52:01.520 --> 52:03.160
Home Assistant, when you look in the log,

52:03.160 --> 52:06.040
it knows when I'm likely commuting and driving.

52:06.040 --> 52:07.960
So I can actually build automations

52:07.960 --> 52:10.260
around when I'm commuting.

52:10.260 --> 52:14.640
It's incredible what they can get from the iOS device

52:14.640 --> 52:18.440
with your permission, of course, and no massive hit

52:18.440 --> 52:19.840
to battery life.

52:19.840 --> 52:20.880
It's really impressive.

52:20.880 --> 52:24.120
And one of the other features that he said he's adding

52:24.120 --> 52:27.280
is local notifications are coming to the iOS devices

52:27.280 --> 52:29.160
soon too with no internet connection required.

52:29.160 --> 52:30.400
So that's really great.

52:30.400 --> 52:32.560
Anyways, so just to wrap it up, I'm very happy.

52:32.560 --> 52:35.060
And when they start shipping, because I was an early backer,

52:35.060 --> 52:36.520
so I got mine a little early.

52:36.520 --> 52:39.480
When they start shipping, I think I may swap out

52:39.480 --> 52:40.300
a couple of mine.

52:40.300 --> 52:41.600
I don't know if I need to do all of them,

52:41.600 --> 52:43.800
but I think I might pop out a couple of my twos

52:43.800 --> 52:46.960
and put a three or two in.

52:46.960 --> 52:48.440
Wise continually amaze me.

52:48.440 --> 52:50.360
All right, we really should get out of here.

52:50.360 --> 52:53.240
