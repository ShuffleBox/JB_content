00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Happy holidays, listener! We have a special episode for you this week. Some old friends

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,400
join the show for a 3D printing special with Alex.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:18,240
Well, I'm joined today by a couple of special guests, long-time JB friends and former colleagues,

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,040
I suppose. We've got Cheese on the line. Hey Cheese, how you doing?

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,480
Hey, hey, how's it going?

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,480
And Drew.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,480
Hello!

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,440
Both of you are now in Colorado. You're both in Denver, serendipitously, I suppose. Cheese,

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,880
you're working for System76 these days, and what about you, Drew?

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:41,900
I am working for the Community College System, so we handle basically high-end IT and server

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,860
needs for 13 different colleges across the state.

12
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,720
And you do chew my ear off about OpenShift on occasion.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,720
Every now and then, yeah.

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,360
It has been known. What about you, Cheese? What are you doing for System76?

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,240
Right now, I'm working with the marketing department, doing videography, photography,

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,200
some animation, graphic design stuff, all sorts of fun, cool things.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,480
I feel like breaking out into Troy McClure at this point, you may remember Cheese from

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,200
shows such as The Friday Stream and all sorts of other Linux Unplugged, all sorts of stuff.

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,160
If you're a long-time JB listener, these two guys will be very familiar to you.

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,760
So I've got these two today to talk to you all about 3D printing. This is a topic that

21
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,400
we covered very briefly in an episode of Self-Hosted recently, and lots of feedback came my way

22
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,360
that you'd like a bit more information.

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,720
So I have two guys that are at different points in their 3D printing journey.

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,040
So just very quickly, Drew, perhaps you could give us a very quick overview of where you're

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,720
at in your journey and that kind of thing.

26
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Sure.

27
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:52,080
So just a few months ago, I purchased my first 3D printer and have been kind of getting up

28
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,720
to speed since then.

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,880
It's a smaller unit.

30
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,680
We'll talk more about the actual gear a little later, but it's a very much the beginner's

31
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,760
entrance style unit that one might pick up.

32
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,940
It's not super fancy.

33
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,920
So you're looking at this discussion through the lens of someone who's been printing for

34
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
a few months.

35
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,320
And what about you, Cheese?

36
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
Where are you at in your journey?

37
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,200
Well, I've been printing now for a couple of years.

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,280
After encouragement, I believe it was from Linux Fest Northwest, where we all met up

39
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:31,120
and you had printed some things, which encouraged me just to bite the bullet and buy a printer.

40
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,160
So I've been using basically the same printer as Drew for quite some time over the last

41
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,160
couple of years and learned that I enjoy the hobby.

42
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,280
So I want to expand that and picked up a new printer recently.

43
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,480
Yeah, I think I 3D printed a carabiner clip to hold my luggage together or something.

44
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,480
Yeah.

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,800
I believe it was that.

46
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:57,640
And you had also printed the on-air signs that were powered by the little NodeMCUs.

47
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
Those things are so cool.

48
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,000
Yeah, I think that's what pushed me over the edge.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,540
Well, I'm glad you like them.

50
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,840
Of course, they're running WLED, so I hope you've been keeping them up to date.

51
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,560
There's lots of new features on that stuff these days on the ESP side of things.

52
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:19,800
So I've been 3D printing a little bit off and on for four, I guess, years.

53
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Quite a long time, I guess.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,640
I got into it through wanting to print little parts for my racing drones.

55
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,260
The perfect use case for me was to print custom holders for all the little tiny circuit boards

56
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,760
that go into an FPV racing drone.

57
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:41,520
And so I learned very basic CAD skills, computer-aided design skills through stuff like Tinkercad

58
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,200
and Fusion 360.

59
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,020
I am not very good, but I can 3D print a cube or a little square box I made for something

60
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,800
easily enough.

61
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,480
And so I've had probably three or four prints.

62
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,400
I think I'm on my fourth printer now.

63
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,120
I've had some of the cheap Chinese ones, and I've got Prusas these days, but we'll come

64
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,400
on to that stuff a bit more later.

65
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,640
But first of all, I thought it might be helpful to talk about what is 3D printing a little

66
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,860
bit for those that aren't familiar with it.

67
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,600
Would either of you two like to take that mantle?

68
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:21,000
I feel like as the junior here, that you as the senior printer should take that.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,840
All right, fine, fine, fine.

70
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,560
Okay, so what we call 3D printing is actually technically probably referred to as a bit

71
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,000
like calling a Docker container a container and Linux container.

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,840
It's that whole Kleenex debate, right?

73
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,620
So what we're actually talking about is what's called FDM printing, fused deposition modeling.

74
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,920
And essentially what that does is it takes a spool of plastic filament, it can be of

75
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,300
different materials.

76
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,880
So there's three main types that I print with, I'll come on to those in a moment.

77
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:59,720
But essentially what FDM printing does is it takes in a spaghetti sized piece of plastic,

78
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:06,720
squishes it through what's called a hot end, melts that plastic at 220 ish Celsius.

79
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,240
It varies on the different filament that you use, the chemical properties of that filament.

80
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,840
So it takes that filament in through a drive gear, squishes it through the hot end, melts

81
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,840
it.

82
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,560
And then the pressure of the drive gears forcing that filament through, forces it out of what's

83
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,040
called a nozzle at the bottom of your hot end.

84
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,040
And so the hot end is the thing that contains the thermistor and it's what contains the

85
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,480
other chamber where the melted plastic is and all that kind of stuff.

86
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,620
And right at the very end of the process is the nozzle, which is what, you know, if you've

87
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:45,760
ever watched a video of a 3D printer printing, it's that kind of nozzle shaped thing, funnel

88
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,420
shaped thing on the bottom where the plastic actually gets extruded out of.

89
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:59,360
And essentially the basic premise is you can use what's called G-code to move stepper motors

90
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,840
left and right, up and down, forwards and backwards.

91
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,600
You can use G-code to control the movement of that nozzle such that it will form layers

92
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
of plastic.

93
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:15,240
You know, we're talking an extruded line of plastic will be half a millimeter wide, a

94
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,600
millimeter wide at most.

95
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:23,360
And what it will do is it will build up layer upon layer upon layer of plastic to form models.

96
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
It has some limitations.

97
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,260
Obviously you can't print stuff with certain overhangs in certain shapes because the layer

98
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:35,360
by layer construction of these things presupposes that there is a support underneath.

99
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,040
So there's all sorts of different ways you can get around that by including supports

100
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,360
in your models and things like that.

101
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,000
But ultimately there are some shapes that just aren't very well suited to 3D printing,

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,160
you know, a complete sphere would be quite tricky because it wouldn't be able to stick

103
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,440
to what's called the print bed.

104
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,180
And so one of the most difficult parts of 3D printing, which I'm sure both of you can

105
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,680
attest to, is that first layer adhesion.

106
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,200
Definitely I know whenever I first started, layer adhesion was definitely a thing for

107
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
me.

108
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:14,020
I was using the inexpensive removable bed that came with my printer and quickly found

109
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,000
out that that probably wasn't the best idea, especially after cracking off one print and

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,880
then kind of putting a crease in part of the removable bed.

111
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,560
Well, you're doing better than me.

112
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:29,400
I had a Creality CR-10 as my first printer and I went to Ikea and purchased a mirror

113
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,720
tile, which is I think about 12 inches square.

114
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,880
And I actually had something stick to the glass so hard that when I was trying to unstick

115
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,560
and unpeel this damn thing, that the print actually smashed the mirror when I took a

116
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,000
chunk of glass with it.

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's impressive.

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,080
Yeah, I mean, I was able to get mine leveled out pretty good, but I definitely had to go

119
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,960
to a glass bed.

120
00:07:51,960 --> 00:08:00,160
So even with the original mat that came with my Ender 3, I honestly didn't have many adhesion

121
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,560
problems with PLA, which we'll get into the types of plastics that you can use.

122
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,780
But PLA I had no trouble with.

123
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:14,880
It's when I started going on to more exotic filaments that I'm using now that I really

124
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,520
started having adhesion problems.

125
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,460
Fortunately I was finally able to suss them out, but it's taken some time and a lot of

126
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,020
experimentation to get there.

127
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,020
It does.

128
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,800
I think we should dispel the myth right now that 3D printing is out of the box, ready

129
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,520
to go hobby.

130
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,880
It's not like you can go to Best Buy and buy a 3D printer like you could a paper printer,

131
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,840
for want of a better word, and just press go and expect it to work first time every

132
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
time.

133
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
That's just not the reality.

134
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,080
They are very finely-toleranced machines.

135
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,600
We're talking microns of a millimetre makes a big difference to how well a layer sticks

136
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
or doesn't.

137
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,240
A few particles of dust can make the difference between a print sticking or not.

138
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,860
Well, and it's not just that.

139
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,580
There are so many different things that can really matter here, like the temperature that

140
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,360
you have the filament coming out at, the temperature that you have the bed sitting at, whether

141
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,100
or not it's in an enclosure depending on what type of material it is.

142
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,020
There are so many different variables that you can mess up and just totally throw off

143
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,020
the whole thing.

144
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,320
All right, so let's break down the filaments for a second.

145
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,160
We mentioned PLA.

146
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,900
That's probably the most beginner-friendly one that's available, and probably the most

147
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,480
popular to be honest.

148
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,180
PLA has a few interesting characteristics.

149
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,420
First of all, it's very easy to work with.

150
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,300
There's very little in the way of stringing.

151
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:44,100
It doesn't require a particularly sticky bed in order to adhese properly, but it can be

152
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,380
quite brittle.

153
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,640
For stuff like my racing drone parts, for example, when it got a bit cold outside, I'd

154
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,460
slam my drone into a tree or something, and the stuff would just snap, it would just crack.

155
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:01,220
It's good for indoor stuff like plant pots, or I've got a rocket lamp behind me that I

156
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,980
3D printed, for example, so a Saturn V rocket.

157
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:09,220
It's good for that kind of stuff where there's very little load and very little stress on

158
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,220
the print.

159
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,740
But if you're wanting to do anything where heat is an issue, let's say you're printing

160
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:21,900
a bracket for your car, another 3D print I've done, a functional print, is a dash cam bracket

161
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:29,500
for my car, and a car in the south of the United States gets pretty warm in the summer.

162
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,860
I'm talking to a Texan and I'm well aware that you guys get warm too, but you know what

163
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,860
I'm saying, right?

164
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,420
If you were to try and use PLA in that environment, very quickly that plastic would get to what

165
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:45,020
it's called its glass transition point and start softening drastically.

166
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,300
And eventually, if it's under any kind of load, even if it's just from a dash cam, a

167
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,940
few grams, it would start to warp and twist and eventually melt.

168
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,340
Yeah, and I think that that depends on your print too because a print that I had made

169
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:04,500
for some friends, they had an above-ground pool and on that pool was a railing that,

170
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,980
I don't know the diameter of that railing, but they had no cup holders, right?

171
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,260
So everyone was trying to figure out like where do I set my drink down.

172
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,400
So I made some cup holders and it just had these little hooks that hooked over the top

173
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:24,060
of the ring on the pool and was able to put your drink there.

174
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:31,820
And they probably sat out there for a little over a year before one of them finally failed

175
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,140
and one of the little arms had cracked.

176
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,620
And I don't know if that's because somebody bumped it or how it happened, but it can hold

177
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:46,260
up to some extent, but under a magnified windshield in the heat, direct heat, probably not the

178
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,260
best.

179
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,460
There's no chances there.

180
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:53,100
So for that kind of application, you want to be looking at something called PETG.

181
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,300
There are a few other types that are suitable for sort of higher temperature environments,

182
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,820
but PETG in particular is one of my go-tos.

183
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,940
It's sort of chemically related to PLA, so it takes the best bits of PLA and another

184
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:13,060
plastic called ABS, which is famously difficult to print and work with because of things like

185
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,040
warping, which is where during a print, the corners of a print will lift and then the

186
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,380
entire model is put under intense stress and it can start to crack and all that kind of

187
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,380
stuff.

188
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:29,140
But PETG is probably the best of both worlds.

189
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:35,380
It's got pretty much the same ease of printing as PLA and almost the same heat-resistant

190
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,580
characteristics as ABS.

191
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:44,060
The downside to PETG is it can be a very sticky thing indeed.

192
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,340
That was the filament that stuck to my glass bed and took a chunk of glass with it, for

193
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,340
example.

194
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:54,300
So chemically, it's very good at bonding with the build layer, the build surface on certain

195
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,300
printers.

196
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,700
So for my Prusa behind me, for example, I actually have two separate sheets.

197
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,860
I have a texture sheet from Prusa, which is actually designed for PETG and a separate

198
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,980
one for PLA just so that I have that separation of concerns.

199
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,260
I don't have to worry about glue sticks or any other kind of nonsense or tape or anything

200
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,260
like that.

201
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,900
It's worth mentioning too that PETG is the slightly more exotic material I referenced

202
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,620
earlier that I was moving towards and was having adhesion issues.

203
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:28,740
It does require more heat than PLA to really get it to flow nicely and you also can't

204
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:35,860
print as fast because to get it to where it's flowing well, if you get it flowing too well,

205
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:41,820
then it bubbles and you need a hotter bed to really get it to stick well.

206
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:48,260
It's a lot more finicky, but not as finicky as something like ABS or anything like that.

207
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:58,900
So we're talking about with PLA for example, the hot end is around 180 Celsius and typically

208
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,940
I run my bed at around 60 Celsius.

209
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:08,700
With PETG, I can run my hot end anywhere from 220 to 250 depending on the particular filament

210
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,380
properties and the bed is anywhere from 80 to 90 degrees Celsius.

211
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,840
So there's a good step up there in the temperature and therefore energy required to use this

212
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:23,700
filament, but that's why it performs better in heat sensitive environments.

213
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:31,300
Speaking of, different filaments from different manufacturers can have vastly different responses.

214
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:38,980
I'm using various filaments from Micro Center and I have my bed turned up to about 100.

215
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,780
I find it works a little better, but I can print with the PETG itself down at about 230

216
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:50,500
which is the low end of what Micro Center actually recommends for that filament.

217
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Really it just depends.

218
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,900
Yeah, most manufacturers will print a recommended set of settings on the side and that's generally

219
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:02,860
a good place to start, but you will need to start printing things like calibration cubes

220
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,300
and temperature towers and torture tests and all this kind of thing.

221
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,800
If you're moving to a completely new supplier of filament and you're not seeing the results

222
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,300
you would expect, there's all sorts of things on a website called Thingiverse that you can

223
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,900
actually download for free to import into your printer's slicer software and send across

224
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,020
to the printer.

225
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:29,320
So speaking of slicers, Cheese, we haven't really touched on that much at all yet.

226
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
Would you like to?

227
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,740
Yeah, so a slicer is basically exactly what it sounds like.

228
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,200
As Alex had mentioned earlier, with FDM you're laying down layer by layer, so a slicer will

229
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:48,740
take your 3D model and separate it layer by layer, drawing the path and or creating the

230
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:55,660
G-code that allows the printer to know in X, Y, and Z in space where the nozzle needs

231
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,700
to be at any given time.

232
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,980
And then once you've taken your model and you've sliced it, then you can import that

233
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,360
G-code directly into your printer and print your model.

234
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:09,540
So there are a couple of different pieces of software, Cura, which is one that I'm a

235
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:15,380
little more familiar with, that's C-U-R-A, it's really great.

236
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,700
And then Prusa, the manufacturer of 3D printers, actually has their own piece of software.

237
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,780
I think they, it's a fork of slicer was the original name and now it's just referred to

238
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,380
as Prusa Slicer, but it's kind of the de facto for them.

239
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,500
It's spelled Slic3R, if you're looking for that on the internet.

240
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Yeah, that's it.

241
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,140
It's LeetSpeak spelled, right?

242
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:43,580
But yeah, it's a great one as well and I'm learning more of that now that I've purchased

243
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:51,340
a Prusa printer, but Cura is also fantastic and there are a lot of settings that you can

244
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,760
take from other resources.

245
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:02,100
So I know Chep is one of the guys I took his settings for Cura originally and they worked

246
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:09,460
really well for me, better than the stock settings that were suggested by Cura itself.

247
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:14,100
So I'm pretty curious to know how the humidity has affected you, because I know you've just

248
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,480
moved from Texas to Colorado, but obviously there's a drastic humidity difference between

249
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:26,500
the Gulf Coast and the Colorado air and PETG is famously hygroscopic, so what that means

250
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,340
is it will absorb water from the air around it.

251
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,900
So me and Riley, for example, with my relatively high humidity, I have to keep my filament

252
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,660
in a dry box full of silica gel in order to try and keep it relatively usable.

253
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:44,060
I was wondering, have you noticed any difference in how you store your filaments and how easily

254
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,500
they print or not at the different altitudes and humidity levels?

255
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,100
Well for me, I haven't really experimented with much outside of PLA.

256
00:17:53,100 --> 00:18:01,380
So I know the PETG, like you said, has a lot more, is hygroscopic as you mentioned.

257
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:08,020
But I will say that with PLA, I have noticed that moving from Texas along the Gulf Coast

258
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:17,440
to here in Colorado, even the PLA, it gets more brittle than normal.

259
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:26,220
So it's not like I keep it in a humidifier or something, but once I get through the batch

260
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,420
of filament that I have now and I move over to PETG, I'll know a little bit more.

261
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:36,180
But so far, the humidity and the change in humidity has affected the PLA, but not significantly

262
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,380
to the point where I can't print with what I have.

263
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,620
How about you, Drew, how's your experience been?

264
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,380
So I've only been doing this a few months.

265
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:52,100
I'm not sure how quickly PETG under circumstances like yours, Alex, would really take on enough

266
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,100
water to need to be dried before printing.

267
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,420
But it could be a month, it could be three or four months.

268
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,340
I mean, it really depends.

269
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,620
For example, you were living in Georgia before and now you're in Colorado.

270
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:12,660
Similar thing as cheese really, an ocean level of Gulf humidity moving up to the mountains.

271
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:21,460
So here I have had my PETG sitting out for a while and I keep it in a box most of the

272
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,460
time.

273
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:28,100
But I don't like after a print is finished, heat up the end and pull the filament and

274
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,740
put it back in the box.

275
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,940
I tend to just kind of leave it on the roll.

276
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,380
You should be fine where you are now.

277
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,300
I mean, I was wondering whether you'd noticed any difference in terms of how, because I

278
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,060
know for example, things like boiling a kettle takes longer altitude and baking recipes are

279
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,060
slightly different.

280
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,060
Yeah, exactly.

281
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:54,900
So no, I haven't had any issues just leaving my PETG on the roll for weeks.

282
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,300
Still prints fine.

283
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,020
All right.

284
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:05,020
Well talking of software, we mentioned PrusaSlicer and Cura, those are the two main slicers.

285
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,640
There's another piece of software that I think everybody ought to know about called Octoprint.

286
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,900
Wonderful piece of software.

287
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,660
It's like the best thing.

288
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,660
Wonderful.

289
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:19,800
Seriously, if you are getting into 3D printing, just do yourself a favor and Google Octoprint.

290
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:26,620
It is something that you install on like a Raspberry Pi and you connect it to your printer

291
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:33,040
via the USB slot and then you can control your printer remotely.

292
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,500
It is damn near necessary for anybody who's really going to do this as a hobby.

293
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,820
You really need a way to be able to touch your printer without having to walk to it.

294
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,820
Absolutely.

295
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,820
I totally agree.

296
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,860
I have a Pi 4 running my Octopi instance.

297
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:55,140
So the piece of software is called Octoprint, but the developer of Octoprint makes available

298
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:00,940
a build for the Raspberry Pi called Octopi, making the Raspberry Pi ecosystem almost synonymous

299
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,260
with 3D printing in my opinion.

300
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,040
And I actually use that to run the Python application, which is Octoprint.

301
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,960
There are a bunch of different plugins you can get.

302
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,420
So for example, I have one that's called Spaghetti Detective, which looks at my webcam feed and

303
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:19,400
tries to use machine learning to try and figure out if my printers come unstuck for any reason.

304
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
That's a fun one.

305
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,140
There's another one that does Telegram integration.

306
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,420
So I get notifications and I can control my printer via Telegram bot.

307
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,260
I can get GIFs as well, all that kind of stuff.

308
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,260
There are hundreds of plugins.

309
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,980
I couldn't possibly list them all.

310
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,060
MQTT is another one.

311
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,420
Yeah, MQTT is awesome.

312
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,980
The time-lapse plugins.

313
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,540
Yes, that one is great.

314
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,140
The webcam plugin, just in general, to let you monitor in real time.

315
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,520
There's even cost estimation plugins.

316
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,820
So based on the G code that you provided, it will estimate how many grams of filament

317
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,060
and how much that filament costs and therefore how much a print's going to cost.

318
00:21:55,060 --> 00:22:00,660
So there are a lot of things in OctoPrint that there's really nothing out there that

319
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:07,660
compares to it that I've seen, and it's probably one of the best uses for a Raspberry Pi, especially

320
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:12,220
if you have, well, specifically if you have a 3D printer.

321
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,220
For sure.

322
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,540
Now I would probably suggest running it on a Pi 4.

323
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:21,420
I've been running it on a Pi 3B Plus for a year or two, but I upgraded about six months

324
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,580
ago to a Pi 4 and it's night and day difference.

325
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:29,500
It's so much faster, and I would highly recommend a Pi 4 as a baseline if you're just getting

326
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,660
into this.

327
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:37,220
So a few months ago, everybody from JB came out to Denver and we all had a jolly good

328
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:44,300
time, but Linode was giving away Raspberry Pis at our little meetup, and I managed to

329
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,660
win one, right?

330
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,300
Yeah, you did.

331
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,140
That's what my Raspberry Pi from Linode is doing.

332
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,140
Awesome.

333
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,140
Rad.

334
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:58,860
So the final filament I think is worth talking about is TPU, which is a flexible filament.

335
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,060
Have either of you experimented at all with flexies?

336
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,060
Not yet.

337
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,940
Looking forward to it though, but not quite yet.

338
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,340
It's a world of pain.

339
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,340
Not at all.

340
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:13,740
I mean, I'm familiar with TPU in that I've purchased phone cases before, but as far as

341
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,660
actually making it myself, no, I haven't.

342
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,620
So with the Creality CR-10 I used to have in London, I was printing a lot of drone parts,

343
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,020
as I said, which included stuff like GoPro mounts.

344
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,500
Like I say, when I smashed into a tree, I wanted some give in the parts, so it didn't

345
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,580
just smash into a thousand pieces.

346
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:36,020
And with the CR-10, it had what's called a Bowden tube extruder, which essentially means

347
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:41,820
that the gearing, which feeds the filament into the hot end, is on the main body of the

348
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:47,820
printer connected to the extruder via a plastic or nylon tube.

349
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,100
Whereas the Prusa has what's called a direct drive extruder.

350
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:56,780
And I've had a lot of success 3D printing with the flexible filaments on the Prusa simply

351
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:01,840
because there's a lot less chance for a flexible filament to kind of collapse on itself and

352
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,580
start tying itself in knots like spaghetti on the direct drive printers.

353
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:14,100
Yeah, I haven't had much experience, actually no experience with TPU yet, but from what

354
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:21,460
I've heard, the direct drive is kind of the way to go for that because, and depending

355
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:27,120
on the extruder itself, right, the extruder itself can have one gear or multiple gears

356
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
in it.

357
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:34,180
So with multiple gears, you're able to pull filaments that are maybe a little bit more

358
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,820
difficult to pull through and through the hot end and out the nozzle.

359
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,620
So I'm looking forward to it.

360
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:44,500
I kind of want to print my own phone case, but we'll see.

361
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,620
I don't want to buy a whole roll and then just be sad because I can't print with it

362
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,260
and now I have a whole roll of TPU.

363
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:57,500
One thing I will say is TPU is incredibly hygroscopic, so just bear that in mind.

364
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,420
There are some more exotic filaments, you know, carbon fiber based ones, but once you

365
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:07,060
start getting out of those main three that we talked about, so PLA, PETG and TPU, once

366
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:11,460
you go outside of those three mainstream ones, there are significant compromises to be made

367
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,900
with all the different other plastics that are available.

368
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:19,020
There are too many for us to get into today, but that's an overview of most entry-level

369
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,900
filaments for most beginners.

370
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,360
Linode.com slash SSH.

371
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,020
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

372
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,020
show.

373
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,300
What I love about Linode, straight up, it's fast, reliable cloud hosting.

374
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,260
You should really go try it for your next project.

375
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,780
It also makes for great R&D if you want to learn something and spin it up super quick.

376
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,380
I guess back in the day, I used to fuss a lot more with VMs on my workstation, but these

377
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,300
days I just jump on the Linode dashboard and I get it going in no time.

378
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,740
One of the things I love is when I'm setting up a system, you can actually get console

379
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,420
access through an SSH session.

380
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,540
They even just give you the command right there in the dashboard.

381
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:02,420
You highlight that, copy that thing, post it into your terminal, you hit that sucker

382
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:07,180
button, and then you're actually in an SSH session looking at the console of your Linode

383
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,180
machine.

384
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,180
It's awesome.

385
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,180
It's just those kinds of things that make it fun for when you really want to get down

386
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,620
deep, but they also have the one-click deployments and stuff.

387
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,720
Maybe you want to do a GitLab.

388
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
Maybe your own Jitsi server.

389
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,220
Get rid of that Zoom.

390
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,060
One-click deployments for that kind of stuff.

391
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,140
They've been rolling out PCIe MVME storage so things are real nice and fast.

392
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,220
They have 11 data centers around the world, so you're going to find something close to

393
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:36,620
you or your clients or whoever you want it to be close to, because there's 11 of them.

394
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:41,380
Linode's been doing this for 18 years, and they just keep dialing it in and making it

395
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,380
better and better.

396
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,860
Go see it for yourself.

397
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,220
Use it for your next project.

398
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,460
Deploy something.

399
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,060
Maybe run a game server up there.

400
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,780
Go have fun and use our promo code and get $100.

401
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:55,780
It's lino.com.

402
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:02,340
So then there's a question about, do I need an enclosure to 3D print?

403
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,100
The answer is maybe.

404
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,100
There are a lot of factors that kind of go into it, but the main one is, do you need

405
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:18,980
to really contain the heat for one, and two, are there environmental variables in the area

406
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:24,980
that you're going to put your 3D printer that you might benefit from using an enclosure?

407
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:31,380
And in my particular case, I have lots of pets with lots of loose fur, and that was

408
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,660
the primary reason that I bought one.

409
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,140
I'm pretty sure it saved a number of my prints already.

410
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,580
Yeah, I mean, there's lots of cases I've had where just a single corner has lifted on a

411
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:47,420
print for no discernibly good reason, and then I realized that the air conditioning kicked

412
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:52,100
on halfway through that print, and I'm like, huh, I wonder if that draft from that vent

413
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:57,820
up there was just enough to cause that part to cool down just enough to lift or something.

414
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,580
So yeah, like you say, it's highly dependent on your environment.

415
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:06,980
It's also highly dependent on the plastic that you're using, so some plastics give off

416
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,760
odors and smells, and sometimes you might want to actually extract those fumes away

417
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,920
from the printer, from the enclosure, but generally speaking, most people run an enclosure

418
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:22,540
to prevent, like you do, pet hair or dust, or to maintain some kind of temperature for

419
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,020
more finicky plastics like ABS.

420
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,580
I could see it being really valuable to have your printer in an enclosure if, say, you

421
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:35,420
had your printer in your garage, and the ambient temperature of your garage may shoot down

422
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:41,940
during the winter, or different variables just in the area in which your printer is.

423
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:49,340
So I could see there being some uses other than just to help maintain the dust and noise

424
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,740
and fumes of a printer.

425
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,140
Yeah, I totally agree.

426
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,100
Garage is a great shout, particularly in a garage as well.

427
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,460
You're going to end up with a lot of environmental debris in there because they're not as well

428
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,620
sealed as a house, for example.

429
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:07,340
All right, shall we take a few moments to discuss the various different printers that

430
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,460
we all have and the gear that we've got?

431
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,460
Yeah, let's do it.

432
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,180
Andrew, would you like to go first?

433
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,380
Sure, as the newbie here.

434
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:23,120
So I bought an Ender 3 Pro, which I then very quickly upgraded various parts of.

435
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:31,000
One thing that I saw on the Ender 3 subreddit that I really, really enjoy is that when you

436
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,940
buy an Ender, you're not buying a 3D printer, you're buying a do-it-yourself 3D printing

437
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,940
kit.

438
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,940
Yes, you are.

439
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,940
Yes.

440
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,620
That is absolutely so true.

441
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:44,900
I have replaced a number of things on my printer already.

442
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:51,780
I went from the Bowden tube setup to a direct drive, and I've also replaced the original

443
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:58,420
hot end with an all metal one, which is to say the original one had a piece of plastic

444
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:04,260
tubing that goes all the way down almost to the nozzle to feed the filament.

445
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:10,100
And the one I replaced it with has a fully metal body so that you don't have the issue

446
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,900
of if you print it too high of a temperature that that tubing starts melting inside the

447
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:20,460
hot end, which can happen once you start getting into things like PETG.

448
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,220
So I just didn't want to deal with that.

449
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,060
I went ahead and upgraded to the direct drive.

450
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:30,260
I've also upgraded to what's called auto bed leveling.

451
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:36,620
So with a normal 3D printer out of the box, typically, at least for the lower end ones,

452
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:44,020
you have to manually go down there and measure down to the millimeter every corner and adjust

453
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:50,980
the height so that it is the same distance from the nozzle all across the whole bed.

454
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:53,740
Potentially every single time you print as well.

455
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,740
Exactly.

456
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,740
Yes.

457
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:01,900
All the calibrations of the previous print cause your calibrations to be off.

458
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:08,060
I mentioned I had a CR-10 in London, which I sold before I moved to America, and that

459
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,460
had manual bed leveling on it.

460
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,660
And it was just the most frustrating thing in the world.

461
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,980
You didn't know if it was going to work until the first layer was all completely done.

462
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,980
Right.

463
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,980
Yeah.

464
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:24,780
So now with the auto bed leveling, it literally will, before print, go through and take measurements

465
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:28,980
in nine different spots, and you can tune that depending on the firmware you're running.

466
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:35,200
But on mine, it's nine different spots across the bed, saves that value, and then when it

467
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,540
goes to print, it pulls that value up, shows itself a mesh, and says, okay, this area is

468
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:43,060
a little lower, so I need to compensate for that.

469
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,340
This area is a little higher, need to compensate for that.

470
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:51,380
And so it takes something that's not level and essentially adjusts itself to make it

471
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,380
level.

472
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,380
One of the best upgrades.

473
00:31:53,380 --> 00:32:00,380
You have just outlined my primary argument for not buying an Ender, very, very eloquently,

474
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,060
and I appreciate the fact that you did.

475
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,740
I'm curious to know, how much did you spend on it in the first place, and then how much

476
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,380
did you spend on upgrades?

477
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,980
Yeah, I'm curious.

478
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:15,740
So the original Ender, I found on clearance at Micro Center for 200 bucks.

479
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,420
That's a great price.

480
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,660
Yes, yes it is.

481
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:25,640
So I snapped that up, and then the upgrade kit with the auto bed leveling, and it also

482
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:31,140
had the silent board, which is the upgraded V2 board, as well as the V2 screen, which

483
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,200
the V2 is the next version up from the Ender 3 Pro.

484
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:45,620
So I got all of that for under 100, and then the direct drive was about 60 bucks.

485
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:55,140
The all metal hot end was about 40, and then I also replaced the cheap brass nozzles that

486
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:01,400
typically are the things that come with it and that most people buy in packets of 20

487
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,220
because they wear out after three prints, in my opinion.

488
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:12,200
I replaced that most recently with a Nozzle X, which the nozzle alone was $40.

489
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,420
So far, it is worth every penny.

490
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:20,900
I'm 60% through my first print with it, and it has had no issues so far.

491
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:26,220
Fingers crossed it's going to be a great upgrade that outlasts the actual printer.

492
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:29,660
So all in, I mean, we're talking what, less than 500 bucks?

493
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,420
Yeah, probably around 400 bucks or so.

494
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:37,100
Yeah, and I feel like I've got a really good machine going now.

495
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,940
Those are some solid bargains, dude.

496
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,160
I think the next time I want to buy something off from Goodwill or something on clearance

497
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,540
or Micro Center, I'm going to deploy Drew to go and find it for me.

498
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,540
That's right.

499
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,340
Deal helm, Drew.

500
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,140
Find any 3D printers wherever you go.

501
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,140
That's right.

502
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,140
I like it.

503
00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:00,320
You know, to be honest, though, Drew, I think that that's probably about the same that I

504
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:07,020
have into my Ender, somewhere sub 500 bucks, I would say.

505
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,860
So you went with an Ender as well, did you, Cheese?

506
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:13,920
Yeah, I went with the Ender 3, the Ender 3 Pro.

507
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:17,260
Probably the same printer as Drew.

508
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,300
I got it for 180 ish on sale through Creality.

509
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,300
Good deal.

510
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,380
I think they're wonderful printers.

511
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:29,840
If you enjoy tinkering, you don't mind assembling it, you don't mind adjusting it to get it

512
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,340
all dialed in, and you don't mind incrementally upgrading it.

513
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:38,700
I think that's particularly interesting because I know that you've just bought yourself a

514
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,700
Prusa.

515
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,700
Yes.

516
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,700
Which is something I'm a huge fan of.

517
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:46,820
And I'm really curious to get your take on someone, you know, besides me, that's just

518
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:53,580
used both an entry level now and what is considered the Rolls-Royce of FDM printers, the Prusa

519
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,640
i3 Mark III.

520
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:01,220
I'm curious to know what you think now of now you've used both.

521
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,180
I think there's a place for both.

522
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:09,700
I think the Ender is great to get started on and see if you like the hobby.

523
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:15,820
And then I think most people find themselves looking at Prusa or other high end 3D printer

524
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:21,860
manufacturers for something that is more just kind of turnkey and reliable.

525
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,120
Yeah, 100%.

526
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,620
And that's definitely what I've gotten with the Prusa.

527
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:35,300
Well let's not forget as well that the Prusas are $750 as a kit and $1,000 pre-built.

528
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,800
So they're twice the price.

529
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,140
They are twice the price.

530
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:45,260
I just splurged and bought the $1,000 kit, the pre-assembled kit.

531
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,620
It came in obviously pre-assembled.

532
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:50,460
See, I have strong opinions about this as well.

533
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:55,760
I think that everybody that's buying a Prusa should, if they have the time and the means,

534
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,620
you know, should go through the process of building it.

535
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:08,860
Because the first time I built a Prusa, I've built two now, I learned so much about electronics,

536
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:13,620
about how different screws fit through different things and just quite what 3D printing is

537
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:19,340
capable of in terms of, you know, part tolerances and the strength of different pillars and

538
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,780
all that kind of stuff that's required.

539
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,180
Highly fascinating procedure.

540
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,740
Yeah, I mean, I think it's worth doing that.

541
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,460
I'm not against that.

542
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,580
But I felt that I had kind of already done that with Ender and I could see that when

543
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:37,340
I had gotten to the point where I wanted, because I generally don't purchase things

544
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:41,300
like this for myself or I wanted to have something that was turnkey, right?

545
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:46,660
So I just wanted to pull it out of the box, set it on the table, plug it in, go through

546
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,540
the initial setup.

547
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,500
Some of the things that you get with the Prusa that you don't get with, say, an Ender, the

548
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:59,340
Prusa comes with a handbook that goes through everything you need to know about the printer.

549
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,100
It's about as thick as a Bible.

550
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,100
It's amazing.

551
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,860
Yeah, it's a great handbook, great documentation.

552
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,700
Not that you can't find great documentation for an Ender or something like that, probably

553
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:15,780
not through the vendor, more so through third parties, but there's documentation available

554
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,780
there.

555
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:22,420
Prusa sets the bar, in my opinion, for documentation, for customer support and also, you know, not

556
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:28,380
to come across as too much of a fanboy, but everything they do is open source.

557
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:32,180
The hardware designs, the drawings, everything is open hardware.

558
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:35,340
It's all based off the original RepRap movement.

559
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:40,780
It's all designed around 3D printers printing more 3D printers, which is kind of a, it's

560
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,200
machines making machines, so Matrix, watch out.

561
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,500
But in my opinion, as a company, Prusa do so much right.

562
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:53,980
They're based out of the Czech Republic in Prague, Joseph Prusa is incredibly present

563
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,980
on social media.

564
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,020
He also does a lot of YouTube stuff.

565
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,660
You'll frequently see him on with Joel Telling, he's the 3D printing nerd on YouTube.

566
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:09,500
And you know, there's so much in my life that is open source, working for Red Hat, obviously

567
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:15,060
open source is at the core of everything that pays my mortgage and it's been a huge factor

568
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,180
in my personal journey with Linux and everything else.

569
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:27,540
So the fact that I can also buy a piece of hardware that is totally open, 100% open,

570
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:34,180
and the vendor has shown a commitment to doing everything open for a decade or so now.

571
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:40,620
For me, Prusa is just a, you know, I'm a fanboy, I'm going to admit it, but Prusa is pretty

572
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,420
much untouchable in my opinion.

573
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:49,400
Yeah, I mean, Prusa does a lot of good things, right, they even have their own prints library

574
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,820
similar to Thingiverse.

575
00:38:51,820 --> 00:39:00,460
But in that same vein, the Ender 3 from Creality is open source and open hardware.

576
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,460
The

577
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,420
Only because of Prusa.

578
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,420
Absolutely.

579
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,860
Well, they set a bar, right?

580
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,860
But

581
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,860
And it didn't used to be.

582
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:13,300
If I recall correctly, it wasn't open and then Creality bowed to public pressure and

583
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:18,140
eventually released drawings that were of a questionable quality to start with and then

584
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,580
they've improved with time.

585
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,980
Well, I mean, I don't know about that.

586
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,740
I haven't, you know, I'm not here to bash on Creality, but I'm just saying that they

587
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:30,880
also have open source, their hardware, you know, but I think that it's good to have someone

588
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,520
like Prusa in the market to help push those narratives and to help push the way that things

589
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,940
should maybe be conducted in an ecosystem, right?

590
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:45,340
So by making these things open hardware and encouraging others to do so, I think it's

591
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,260
awesome.

592
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:52,660
I think I look at this through the lens of drone racing, where there's an awful lot of

593
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:57,540
commodity parts put together onto flight controllers and things like that.

594
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,300
And Chinese clones are a real problem in that industry.

595
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:09,500
You'll have a lot of guys in the West that put a lot of IP into developing specific radios

596
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:13,860
and flight control algorithms and all this stuff.

597
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:19,280
And they will put that board out to be made at a factory in China at a decent price.

598
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,540
And then two weeks later, a complete copy clone of that thing is floating around for

599
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:27,700
half the price on the internet, you know?

600
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:33,780
And for a while, I kind of felt like Creality were in that similar space of just copying

601
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,340
IP.

602
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:40,500
They have proven me wrong, I think, in general.

603
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:46,540
They've done a lot of stuff to open source a lot of their drawings and stuff like that,

604
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,540
but there's still a way for them to go, I think.

605
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,940
Definitely think there's a way for them to go.

606
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:55,840
I mean, I think there's a way for the entire industry to go as well.

607
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:02,860
And I think, you know, going back to kind of why I had ended up going from Ender to

608
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,720
Prusa, Prusa has a lot of nice features, right?

609
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:11,820
It's got auto bed leveling built in with a really accurate probe.

610
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:20,660
It's got a really nice bed that comes with it and the steel sheet to put on the bed.

611
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,780
And Drew had mentioned earlier that it draws a mesh, essentially.

612
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:30,660
So mind you, all of these printers, regardless of which one it is, the bed is not going to

613
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,820
be manufactured perfectly true.

614
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,660
It's basically impossible for that to happen.

615
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:41,100
That's why you see people use mirrors on their 3D printers is because mirrors are generally

616
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,140
more true than a piece of glass.

617
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:49,100
Because if you had a mirror that wasn't true or flat, then you would have a funhouse mirror.

618
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,860
And I don't think, you know, everyone wants to wake up in the morning staring at a funhouse

619
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,220
version of themselves while they brush their teeth.

620
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,660
So there are a lot of nice features that come with the Prusa.

621
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:06,880
You get the direct drive extruder, which you can also love this feature, remove the filament.

622
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,440
So instead of, say, with my Ender, I would heat up the hot end and then just yank the

623
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,560
filament out.

624
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:18,380
With the Prusa, it will heat up the hot end and then reverse the drive gears in the extruder

625
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,760
to pull the filament out.

626
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,100
And I just pulled the filament out of the top of the extruder.

627
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,660
It's pretty nice.

628
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,660
Super nice.

629
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,200
Super clean.

630
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:31,920
The steppers and the drivers for the motors or the steppers themselves and the drivers

631
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,420
for them are super quiet.

632
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,260
I hear the fans more than I hear the motors, which wasn't true.

633
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:42,260
And I'm sure, Drew, you can attest to this that the original Ender board that you had

634
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:49,140
in your Ender 3, the sound from whenever you upgraded from the original board to the version

635
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,460
2, just the drivers for the motors.

636
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,980
Dude, it's night and day.

637
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,980
Reduced.

638
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,980
Absolutely.

639
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:00,820
Yeah, it's ridiculous how loud the Ender 3 Pro is out of the box.

640
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:06,640
So let me ask you both, what kind of stuff do you print these days?

641
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:12,500
So I've been printing lately things like cases and stands for various items that need them

642
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:18,740
around the house, some things for some musical instruments and things of that nature.

643
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:24,760
My wife and I, when we first started getting into 3D printing, part of the goal was to

644
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:34,660
design things, print them, and then use her Cricut maker to print vinyl, which could then

645
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:41,740
be 2D printed to have her designs on them and then go on to the 3D objects to sell through

646
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,740
her store.

647
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,000
That's very cool.

648
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,140
So that's coming.

649
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:52,220
We both need a little more experience with our individual parts, like I need to get a

650
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,220
little better.

651
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:58,840
I haven't designed anything yet as far as 3D printing is concerned.

652
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,640
That's the next level up, right?

653
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,660
That's a whole nother bowl game, man.

654
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,660
Absolutely.

655
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:08,400
I'm getting used to making the filament do what I want it to do before I try to make

656
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,060
it do stuff that we're going to sell.

657
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,660
Understandable, absolutely.

658
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:22,100
For me, I've been printing, well, shortly after, I would say maybe four months after

659
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:31,060
we got our printer, COVID hit, and like many makers at the time, Alex, I know you're one,

660
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:35,900
and had encouraged me to get onto the bandwagon as well, started pitching in and making face

661
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:42,960
masks or shields using our 3D printers and some other materials.

662
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,620
So I spent a lot of time doing that, printed a ton of those for schools and nurseries and

663
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,380
random public places.

664
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:55,300
But I enjoy printing cases, little electronics projects.

665
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:02,620
I think after seeing your recording sign project and it also got me kind of into microcontrollers

666
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,740
and I think that 3D printing helped kind of drag me there too.

667
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:15,900
So like I've printed a little project that has a 0.96 inch OLED screen that basically

668
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:21,020
connects to OctoPrint, tells me the progress of a print, sits on my desk, it's powered

669
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,740
by five volts.

670
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:29,080
Just recently finished printing a case for a stream deck that I'm planning on making

671
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:38,300
using a Arduino Pro Micro, some sliders and actually some of the Jade switches that are

672
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:42,260
left over from the launch keyboards.

673
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:49,680
Sometimes in our shipment of switches we get bent pins and so we have like a bent pin bucket.

674
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,800
So I raided the bent pin bucket and found some switches to include in the project.

675
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,940
So looking forward to getting that one done.

676
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:03,340
But I think as you start with the hobby you find just things that you can print online,

677
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:10,280
things that are useful, then you drift into kind of designing things and the next thing

678
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:14,420
you know you're just absolved in it I guess.

679
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,660
It's kind of like a drug addiction to some extent, right?

680
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,500
Maybe a drug addiction would be cheaper at times.

681
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,500
At times.

682
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,500
I mean at times, right?

683
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,500
Maybe.

684
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,500
Maybe.

685
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:30,580
I mean I wouldn't imagine over the long term, maybe short term, but like Drew said, buying

686
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:34,620
the upgrades and upgrading the thing, you just kind of get into this something I don't

687
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,620
know what it is.

688
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:40,900
It's like this thing that just pulls you forward to like let's make all of the things.

689
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:48,460
How can I just make this myself instead of just being a consumer and just grabbing the

690
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:54,100
first thing off the shelf that kind of fits your needs or solves your problem.

691
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:58,220
It's nice to be able to actually make something yourself to solve that problem.

692
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,220
Totally agree.

693
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,860
An example of that in my life recently.

694
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:05,240
My daughter recently figured out how to crawl and so obviously we started needing to baby

695
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:11,260
proof the house so I've printed corner protectors for you know things like coffee tables and

696
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:15,020
the outlet prong protector things.

697
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,060
All sorts of little things like that you know.

698
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,580
Have you printed any little door locks for like under the cabinet?

699
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:23,940
No, but I think I will need to pretty soon.

700
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:29,740
I do a lot of stuff like shelf brackets and little widgets to help me you know in the

701
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:33,900
workshop when I'm doing woodworking that kind of stuff like little templates and routing

702
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:38,580
guides and jigs that kind of thing.

703
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,620
There's just so many little things you can do with it.

704
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:48,700
There's a great subreddit called r-slash-functional-print and there's all sorts of great stuff on there.

705
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:54,220
So if you're struggling for inspiration, take a look at that subreddit.

706
00:47:54,220 --> 00:48:00,500
Have you guys on the note of all of these printers and Alex I'm sure you guys have,

707
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:05,340
Drew have you had a chance to see the new Prusa XL printer?

708
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,340
That's a big boy.

709
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,340
I have not.

710
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,340
How big is it?

711
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,340
It's XL.

712
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:20,340
It's not double XL but it's XL but it also has automatic extruder tool head changes.

713
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:24,420
So you can have multiple filaments loaded like I think it's five filaments loaded at

714
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:30,820
a time and it will just pick the head and pull the hot end and head.

715
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:37,620
Typically a Prusa is nine inches tall by eight inches front to back and left to right.

716
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:45,260
The Prusa XL is 14 inches square, that's its build volume is front to back left to right

717
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:53,200
up down 14 inches so significantly larger and in order to do that they're charging $2,000

718
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,540
as a starting point for this printer.

719
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:59,400
Bear in mind a normal Prusa starts at $750 and they've got the Prusa Mini as well which

720
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:05,180
starts at $300, $400 something like that to compete with the Enders.

721
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:10,380
But like Cheez says, the really cool game-changing feature that they've got on this new Prusa

722
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:15,060
XL, it's not just the fact that they're changing the heads or anything, they're changing the

723
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,420
whole tool.

724
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:21,020
So it's five separate, you can have up to five separate extruders on this thing.

725
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:25,360
So you could 3D print five completely different materials.

726
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:30,020
So you could have dissolvable filaments, soluble filaments to do supports for example that

727
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,540
you could then submerge your print and they would just dissolve.

728
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:37,140
So there's all sorts of really interesting different applications you could use for that

729
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,140
one.

730
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:41,860
And it has a really neat new bed technology.

731
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:46,900
The way that they've segmented the bed, so instead of it just being a flat bed, they've

732
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:52,300
segmented the beds leaving like cooling and expansion channels in between so that as the

733
00:49:52,300 --> 00:50:00,620
print, as the bed heats up and expands and contracts, you'll be less likely to have warpages

734
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:03,580
on the bottom of your prints where they're adhering to the bed and stuff.

735
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:09,780
A lot of cool new tech definitely coming out from Prusa, which I think is going to set

736
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:17,700
the bar for everyone else going forward and hopefully we'll continue to do this ourselves

737
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,340
and next year we'll sit down and see where we are.

738
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:26,740
But I did have a couple of questions for you Alex and Drew as well.

739
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:32,420
Do you guys weigh your filament before you put a print together?

740
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:37,100
So if you know that you're going to have an extended print, do you weigh the filament

741
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:42,860
that's on the roll before you load it into your printer to make sure you have enough

742
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:47,060
filament or do you just cross your fingers and hope that you have enough filament?

743
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,460
I do the cross and clench method, yeah.

744
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:53,660
The Prusa has a filament run out sensor so I'm not too worried.

745
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:59,820
Yeah, my upgrade kit also came with a filament run out sensor which I haven't actually installed

746
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:00,820
yet.

747
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:07,940
I need to do that but I also haven't gone through enough filament yet to really make

748
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,340
it necessary as of now.

749
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:13,460
Got you, got you.

750
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,700
But I mean do you weigh your filament?

751
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,500
How do you measure to know if you have enough filament on a roll to complete a print?

752
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,340
Do you just do the same method, just the cross and clench method?

753
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,340
Yeah, pretty much.

754
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,340
Yeah, eyeballing.

755
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:30,380
You're like, that's roughly half a roll, we can roughly get this much out of it.

756
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:34,820
Well, I haven't gone even through half a roll of any of my individual rolls yet.

757
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:40,060
I've got like eight different rolls of filament sitting around and I've kind of played with

758
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,820
each of them so far, you know.

759
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:48,220
If you consider that each roll of filament is a kilo, typically it's a kilogram, that's

760
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,220
a lot of plastic.

761
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:54,020
So you'd be printing something pretty massive in order to go through an entire roll in a

762
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,020
single print.

763
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,020
Yeah.

764
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,780
I think where it matters more is where you're trying to use up the dregs, for example.

765
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,060
Absolutely, and that's why I'd asked, yeah.

766
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:05,580
I got pretty good when I was doing the mask making that you referenced when COVID first

767
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,740
started, kind of doing like a hot swap.

768
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:12,420
I would sort of sit, you know, a printer's next to me on my desk, I'd sit and watch it

769
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:17,300
and then I would have the second spool ready and I just sort of get a lighter and fuse

770
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,260
it together really roughly and then sort of file it down a little bit and sort of show

771
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:27,860
it and it would be fine, it would jam occasionally, but most of the time it was fine.

772
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,100
I never thought of that.

773
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:33,740
Whilst doing that I would do the same, but I would just watch OctoPrint and then hit

774
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:34,740
pause.

775
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,740
You could do that, that's probably safer.

776
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,140
And then just swap the filament out real quick.

777
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,100
That's probably safer.

778
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:44,380
I never thought of, I mean that's a good way to do that, I mean I guess you could potentially

779
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,380
introduce clogs, but.

780
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:49,540
I could potentially burn my house down, but apart from that.

781
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:53,780
I mean only, you know, the nozzles are only a few cents each if you get the cheap brass

782
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:57,900
ones that Drew had mentioned earlier.

783
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,900
What about maintenance?

784
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,340
What do you guys do for maintenance on your printers?

785
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:06,620
There is an excellent video by a Welsh guy on YouTube whose name escapes me, but I'll

786
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:11,380
put a link to it in the show notes, where he talks through dismantling a Prusa for example

787
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:14,380
and all the different oils that you need to put on various different parts and what have

788
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,580
you.

789
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:19,460
I tend to do it on an annual basis or as often as I can be bothered.

790
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,140
It really depends how much you're printing, how many hours a day you're printing, that

791
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:23,340
kind of thing.

792
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:28,900
My printer sits idle much more than it's printing to be perfectly honest, so I don't feel the

793
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,700
need to do quite so much maintenance.

794
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,620
But if I was running a print farm or something I would definitely put it as part of a regular

795
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,620
regime.

796
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:37,620
Gotcha.

797
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,620
What about you Drew?

798
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:43,500
I don't imagine you've done much since you haven't had a printer too long, but what kind

799
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,860
of maintenance do you do?

800
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:50,940
As far as the printer maintenance that Alex is talking about, I haven't done any.

801
00:53:50,940 --> 00:54:00,100
However, once a week or so if I have an issue that I notice, like the x-axis is a little

802
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:07,000
wonky on a print, I'll go through and I'll check the belts, spot checking various things.

803
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,420
One thing I will say is after every print I will go through with a microfiber cloth

804
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:17,540
and just wipe down the bed, wipe off the nozzle, make sure that everything's clean and ready

805
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,300
for the next time I go to print.

806
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:25,740
That is one thing that I would say is well worth doing is just having something around

807
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:30,420
to just wipe down the bed and wipe down the nozzle at the very least every time you do

808
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,180
a print.

809
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:37,900
Just because you can get stuff that maybe attaches to the nozzle, although it's less

810
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:43,980
of a problem if you have one of the nicer nozzles than it is with brass, but still it's

811
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:49,780
good practice to clean up after yourself in your workspace.

812
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:54,340
I would say that I do that as well every time I have like a little spray bottle of isopropyl

813
00:54:54,340 --> 00:55:00,660
alcohol and a microfiber cloth that I just spray down and wipe the bed every time I finish

814
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:01,660
with the print.

815
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:06,740
I used to spray mine down, but now with the PETG because I am printing on tempered glass,

816
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:09,420
I do use glue stick.

817
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,460
So I tend to leave the glue stick.

818
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:14,740
I don't wipe that down after every use.

819
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:20,780
I'll do a number of prints before I go through and wash it off and reapply.

820
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:24,580
That's one of the beautiful things about the Prusa though is I can't remember the last

821
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,140
time I cleaned my bed.

822
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:32,100
Maybe that's bad, but it just works every time.

823
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:36,180
I'm looking forward to that, but I'll probably still clean my bed every single time I print

824
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,180
something.

825
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,180
It's a habit, dude.

826
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,180
I just can't not.

827
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:44,940
I used to just out of habit from the CR-10 that I had, but eventually I just stopped

828
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:51,140
and whilst I was doing the masks, I got pretty good at figuring out what was actually needed

829
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:56,900
versus what the internet told me I needed to do.

830
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:02,500
Generally speaking, as long as your house isn't in the desert full of dust, you should

831
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,920
be fine with just the occasional wipe down.

832
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:11,860
When I say clean, all I really mean is literally taking a microfiber cloth, running it across

833
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:17,700
the bed, running it across the nozzle, job done.

834
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:21,660
We're not talking about you have to get in there and scrub every nook and cranny or anything

835
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:22,660
like that.

836
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,660
No.

837
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:29,100
I had to do that on my glass bed with the Creality that I had.

838
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:34,020
Take some dish soap and wash it with love and care and affection and then never touch

839
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,500
it and get my – it was just a pain in the ass.

840
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,780
After every print.

841
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:38,780
Pretty much, yeah.

842
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:39,780
Oh, God.

843
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:40,780
Wow.

844
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:41,780
That's horrible.

845
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,780
Bear in mind, this was like four years ago before things have come on a bit of a way

846
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:45,780
since then.

847
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,780
That's fair.

848
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,780
Yeah.

849
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,820
I mean, for anybody listening, if you're getting into it and you want to take my route

850
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:56,140
where you're kind of spending a little less money and doing some DIY upgrades, go get

851
00:56:56,140 --> 00:57:00,980
yourself some decent quality glue stick.

852
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:01,980
It makes a world of difference.

853
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:02,980
It really does.

854
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:03,980
100%.

855
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:06,500
Now, thank you both for joining.

856
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:11,340
I really appreciate you taking the time out of your schedules to come and talk to us today.

857
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:14,100
Is there any way you'd like to send people to follow you or anything?

858
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:21,660
I mean, you can follow me on Twitter at Cheese Bacon, that's C-H-C-B-A-C-O-N.

859
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:25,540
If you have any questions or just want to talk shop, feel free to reach out.

860
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,100
My DMs are open.

861
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,100
Yep.

862
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,540
Same here, Drew of Doom on Twitter.

863
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:31,540
Feel free to reach out.

864
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,220
Well, thank you both very much.

865
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,220
Thank you for having me, man.

866
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,220
Yeah.

867
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:36,220
Thank you.

868
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,740
Maybe 2022 will be the year that I finally get a 3D printer.

869
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,140
I know my kids would love it.

870
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:44,660
And then I know I'd start printing stuff for my RV all the time.

871
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:48,500
I want to say a special holiday thank you to our members over at selfhosted.show slash

872
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,920
S-R-E. You make this show possible.

873
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,760
Don't forget you also get the extra post show.

874
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:02,340
And we now, after a lot of, I guess the term is popular demand, as they say, we now have

875
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:05,420
a network membership at Jupiter.party.

876
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:07,740
You can gift it as well.

877
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,900
We'll have that for a little bit longer.

878
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,940
And also till the end of December, if you sign up, we're taking two bucks off.

879
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,300
So normally the membership is just the cost of two memberships, but you get access to

880
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:23,260
all the show special stuff, all the goodies, the behind the scenes stuff and love the member

881
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:29,820
stuff that you get only with self hosteds, member show, the coder QA, all that and Linux

882
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:36,020
action news, totally ad free and any new content we add as well for just the price of two memberships.

883
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:41,020
But right now, until the end of the month of December, we're taking two bucks off for

884
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,540
a year.

885
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:48,820
This membership is designed to let us be picky, to make sure we choose the right sponsors.

886
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:54,100
We get a lot of emails that come in and we don't want to be in a position where we have

887
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:58,180
to work with a sponsor that we don't actively believe in.

888
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,620
And this lets us be picky.

889
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:04,340
It gives us runway because these good sponsorship deals, they don't happen overnight.

890
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,500
They take months to develop a relationship.

891
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,640
You give us the runway to do that.

892
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:13,140
The episodes where there's fewer sponsorships, those are the episodes our members actually

893
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,700
make possible too.

894
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:21,140
So it's a pretty special thing and it puts you in the driver's seat because you're funding

895
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,500
the content and that's fundamental.

896
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,980
That changes everything.

897
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:30,300
Jupiter.party if you'd like to be a member for the entire network or selfhosted.show

898
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:34,100
slash SRE if you'd like to be a member just for this show.

899
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:38,380

So happy holidays from the self-hosted team and feel free to reach out to us at selfhosted.show

902
