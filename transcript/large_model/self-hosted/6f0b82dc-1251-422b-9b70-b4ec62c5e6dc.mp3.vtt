00:00.000 --> 00:04.080
Coming up on today's show, Chris talks about industrial grade LTE.

00:04.080 --> 00:07.520
We have a philosophical debate on cloud versus local,

00:07.520 --> 00:10.880
and I experienced full blown Americana this Halloween.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.240
It involves golf carts.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.040
I'm Chris.

00:13.040 --> 00:14.880
And I'm Alex, and this is Self Hosted.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.720
Well, this is an awkward one because it's just after Halloween

00:18.720 --> 00:20.400
and just before the election.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.680
So there's a lot going on.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.680
How are you doing, Alex?

00:23.680 --> 00:25.520
I'm doing very well, thank you, yes.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.640
We don't really celebrate Halloween very much in England,

00:28.640 --> 00:30.640
but it's a big deal over here, isn't it?

00:32.400 --> 00:36.720
I actually had my, I think one of my biggest Halloween wins as a dad,

00:36.720 --> 00:38.880
and it just came on accidentally

00:38.880 --> 00:42.320
while the kids were out doing a Halloween activity.

00:42.320 --> 00:46.000
I had the realization in a moment of clarity

00:46.000 --> 00:47.600
where nothing else was going on,

00:47.600 --> 00:52.400
I realized that basically 90% of the lights in my house are smart lights.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.440
And I always have them at just a warm white,

00:55.440 --> 00:57.600
but I actually could change their colors.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.720
And so I went around, well, inside Home Assistant,

01:00.720 --> 01:04.080
and changed all the different colors of the lights to Halloween colors

01:04.080 --> 01:07.040
and then turned on the Halloween sound effects on the Home Pods.

01:07.040 --> 01:07.680
Oh, cool.

01:08.640 --> 01:11.520
And then the kids got home and opened up the door to Lady Choops,

01:11.520 --> 01:15.120
and it was like a Halloween festival inside.

01:15.120 --> 01:18.080
It was like a nice smart home win moment

01:18.080 --> 01:19.680
because everybody looked around and went,

01:19.680 --> 01:22.320
oh, yeah, right, colors.

01:22.320 --> 01:23.200
You can do that.

01:24.880 --> 01:25.840
How is it going for you, though?

01:25.840 --> 01:29.040
I mean, Halloween's one thing, but of course, the election's coming up.

01:29.040 --> 01:33.280
There's got to be a lot of new, a lot of America in your face right now.

01:33.280 --> 01:37.200
Well, yeah, I think the most American thing I've seen since I emigrated

01:37.200 --> 01:40.000
is a family trick or treating on a golf cart.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.200
Oh, that's next level.

01:42.240 --> 01:43.360
That's a good idea.

01:43.360 --> 01:47.200
You know, I mean, you don't want to have to wear yourself out getting your candy.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.640
You don't have to walk.

01:48.640 --> 01:51.680
I mean, and even this year, because it was all, you know, corona,

01:51.680 --> 01:52.800
everything was socially distant.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.840
So people just placed the tables at the end of their driveways.

01:55.840 --> 01:59.920
And the kids, they literally drive along on the golf cart, hop off,

01:59.920 --> 02:03.440
take three paces to the nearest driveway, load up the bowl of candy,

02:03.440 --> 02:05.600
and then off they go again.

02:05.600 --> 02:09.120
So it's a minimum viable effort trick or treating this year.

02:09.120 --> 02:12.160
I lurk on a lot of the communities that share their ring footage.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.920
This is a thing on the internet, by the way.

02:15.920 --> 02:17.680
People that share their ring footage.

02:17.680 --> 02:22.320
And so many, so many videos this year, a lot of them have made it to Reddit

02:22.320 --> 02:28.160
of full-fledged dudes like adults just coming up and wholesale stealing candy out of bowls.

02:30.320 --> 02:31.680
I just can't even with these people.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.400
People need to do something better with their time.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.280
Like get certified.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.440
This episode is brought to you by Cloud Guru.

02:37.440 --> 02:40.160
Are you looking to make a high paying career move into the cloud?

02:40.160 --> 02:43.200
Well, there's no better place to start than getting a certification.

02:43.200 --> 02:46.720
ACG has helped more than 2 million people skill up on the cloud.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.760
AWS, Azure, and Google exam preps, you're covered.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.800
Just get going at a cloudguru.com.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.760
I'm so excited.

02:53.760 --> 02:57.040
I saw on the road outside my neighborhood last week,

02:57.040 --> 03:02.480
the AT&T techs were fiddling around with a ditch, which running fiber up the road.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.120
So I might be getting fiber soon.

03:05.680 --> 03:10.480
Oh, I was thinking maybe they were running down infrastructure for the towers for 5G.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.360
Oh, it could be.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.480
Yeah, it could be.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.160
You've got to get that Corona in somehow.

03:16.800 --> 03:17.280
Right.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.280
You got to get in every town in every neighborhood.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.680
Well, I mean, either way, though, you're getting an upgrade, right?

03:21.680 --> 03:24.320
So fiber would be great.

03:24.320 --> 03:26.800
Speaking of backhaul, though, you have been

03:26.800 --> 03:30.160
going crazy with this industrial LTE modem setup.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.200
Tell me about that.

03:31.200 --> 03:31.920
Oh, my gosh.

03:32.640 --> 03:36.800
I have achieved LTE nirvana, I suspect.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.240
I mean, early days, big, big upgrade for the RV.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.080
So super quick recap.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.320
For those of you who maybe are new or don't know,

03:44.320 --> 03:49.840
I choose to live in a Class A RV, a 40-foot bus, basically.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.280
That's what the Class A is.

03:51.280 --> 03:52.640
A baked bean tin on wheels.

03:52.640 --> 03:53.280
Yeah, carry on.

03:53.280 --> 03:58.640
And it's sometimes loaded up with kids and dogs and tons of podcasting gear.

03:58.640 --> 04:04.720
And it has to accommodate working from home and school from home now for three kids.

04:04.720 --> 04:09.920
And my wife, who has transitioned some of her practice online, so she's doing video calls.

04:09.920 --> 04:12.560
You forgot one important thing that it carries as well.

04:12.560 --> 04:13.280
What's that?

04:13.280 --> 04:15.040
Your poops.

04:15.040 --> 04:15.600
That's true.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.880
Lady Jupes carries my poop.

04:16.880 --> 04:22.480
So I call my RV Lady Jupiter, named by the audience, live on Linux Unplugged one day.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.400
And for short, Lady Jupes.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.960
And you might not think of this initially, but it's really tricky to have a solid,

04:28.960 --> 04:35.440
reliable internet connection in a mobile vehicle, especially if it's not just a car.

04:35.440 --> 04:39.840
Because there's some booster solutions that you just throw an antenna on the roof of your car.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.200
They're pretty straightforward.

04:41.200 --> 04:45.360
But I needed something that could accommodate a family, that could accommodate work,

04:45.360 --> 04:48.000
and that could accommodate multiple cellular scenarios.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.640
Because some areas have better carrier coverage.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.480
In fact, it's just how it always works.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.480
There's some areas that are stronger with different carriers.

04:55.360 --> 05:01.840
And through research, I had come across the PepWave Max Transit by a company called Peplink.

05:01.840 --> 05:09.680
The Max Transit is a purpose-built modem router unit with two LTE modems,

05:09.680 --> 05:11.520
each with two antenna ports.

05:12.080 --> 05:15.440
And you can do redundancy, you can do combination here.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.880
I'll get into that a little bit.

05:16.880 --> 05:20.320
With optional speeds on the modems.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.920
So to really learn all this, Alex, it was actually really kind of fun because I had

05:23.920 --> 05:28.240
to learn a lot about LTE and LTE modems that I never knew before.

05:28.240 --> 05:34.640
And I didn't know or appreciate that there were multiple categories of LTE modems.

05:34.640 --> 05:41.280
And each category is sort of translatable to an expected best-case scenario speed.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.920
Well, I know there's lots of different bands available,

05:43.920 --> 05:46.480
like different frequencies, effectively, is what that means.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.480
Right. There's that as well.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.000
Oh, that's different.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.920
Yes. And also very important.

05:51.920 --> 05:59.840
It's so crazy, Alex, because you have networks like AT&T, and they have this super hodgepodge

05:59.840 --> 06:04.080
network where they have got different bands in different areas, and it's very uncommon.

06:04.080 --> 06:11.520
And then you have a carrier like Verizon, who in comparison has a much more kind of streamlined

06:11.520 --> 06:16.320
network, a more maybe custom or intentionally built network.

06:16.320 --> 06:24.560
But no, the category of the modem, to really kind of just make it just super approachable,

06:24.560 --> 06:29.200
think of the category of a modem like how many antennas it has.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.840
And each category you go up, you get more antennas.

06:31.840 --> 06:39.920
And antennas, you could think of those as listening ears and sending ear and mouths

06:39.920 --> 06:41.280
to the tower.

06:41.280 --> 06:45.440
And the more antennas you have, the faster the connection is.

06:45.440 --> 06:52.160
And it could be really common for a cell phone to have two or even like four antennas like

06:52.160 --> 06:54.080
in the iPhone 12 now.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.440
And in certain scenarios, you can utilize all those antennas at once.

06:57.440 --> 07:02.640
And each one of them could be potentially 20, 30 megabits.

07:02.640 --> 07:06.800
So I needed something that was pretty high end.

07:06.800 --> 07:11.520
I had to find that sweet spot between ridiculous money, because this is something you could

07:11.520 --> 07:18.480
spend ridiculous money on, and something that was performant enough that I could actually

07:18.480 --> 07:20.620
notice a difference when I went through all this hassle.

07:20.620 --> 07:24.800
And so I ended up with something that's called a category 12 modem.

07:24.800 --> 07:34.320
And that has somewhere around a maximum transfer speed on LTE of around 603 megabits, potentially

07:34.320 --> 07:37.520
if your LTE network could handle that.

07:37.520 --> 07:44.120
So you could go as far up as a gigabit with some of these modems, but the cost just exponentially

07:44.120 --> 07:45.120
grows.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.500
So I went right there in the middle.

07:46.500 --> 07:50.720
Some systems have what's called a category four, some have all these different categories.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.800
At the end of the day, you have to kind of pick and choose.

07:52.800 --> 07:56.240
And when you start getting into this, you have to start learning what these terms mean.

07:56.240 --> 08:01.120
So I wrapped my head around all of that, and I got myself a dual cat 12 modem.

08:01.120 --> 08:07.840
So I have two cellular LTE modems, each of which are capable of around 600 megabits,

08:07.840 --> 08:10.200
given the proper LTE connectivity.

08:10.200 --> 08:13.560
So do those things support GSM and CDMA?

08:13.560 --> 08:16.740
GSM and CDMA are a different set of technologies.

08:16.740 --> 08:18.720
This is all LTE.

08:18.720 --> 08:23.640
And then within LTE, like you touched on earlier, there's a ton of different bands that you

08:23.640 --> 08:26.300
could get that have their various pros and cons.

08:26.300 --> 08:29.880
That's interesting, because when I unboxed my OnePlus 8T last week, I put my Verizon

08:29.880 --> 08:35.960
SIM into it, and it said this device is CDMA-less, and I'm like, uh-oh, and then it just activated

08:35.960 --> 08:36.960
just fine.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.600
So does that mean that CDMA is not really a thing anymore?

08:40.600 --> 08:41.600
Right.

08:41.600 --> 08:45.440
Yeah, Verizon was the bigger CDMA carrier, and they've transitioned to LTE.

08:45.440 --> 08:46.440
Fascinating.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.200
And of course, 5G is just around the corner, right?

08:48.200 --> 08:49.840
So there's also that math.

08:49.840 --> 08:55.520
I had to look at getting a technology that was sufficiently performant, but was sort

08:55.520 --> 09:00.080
of established and reliable enough that I felt comfortable putting it in my RV.

09:00.080 --> 09:05.120
I sort of treat the RV like a boat, and I don't always go for the absolute crazy, latest

09:05.120 --> 09:06.120
and greatest.

09:06.120 --> 09:10.800
Like when I put my lithium and solar system in, I got a really nice system, but there

09:10.800 --> 09:16.500
are crazier, newer, higher-tech systems that are coming out now.

09:16.500 --> 09:21.880
But I kind of go for one generation back that's gotten really good, gotten a lot of market

09:21.880 --> 09:26.560
adoption and really worked out a lot of the bugs, and then I put that into the RV.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.960
And that's what these transits are.

09:28.960 --> 09:38.920
This Pep Wave is built for public use on transit, on a bus, in a plane, where you have maybe

09:38.920 --> 09:44.720
even up to 100 people using Wi-Fi off of this thing and then using its LTE connection.

09:44.720 --> 09:50.240
And it is this particular line, the MAX line for these transit devices, are ruggedized

09:50.240 --> 09:51.720
for harsh environments.

09:51.720 --> 09:57.040
They're built to be going down the road bumping, and they're built to be powered directly off

09:57.040 --> 09:59.800
of DC or AC if you need.

09:59.800 --> 10:05.600
And so they're like for a home use, they're just up to the line of overkill without actually

10:05.600 --> 10:08.240
being overkill for my particular use case.

10:08.240 --> 10:12.560
So I'm just looking at this picture you have in the show notes of the device itself, and

10:12.560 --> 10:17.720
there are lots of antenna holes and serial and console and power inputs and Ethernet

10:17.720 --> 10:19.800
jacks and all the rest of it.

10:19.800 --> 10:24.920
So what do you need to put on the outside of your bus and stuff like that?

10:24.920 --> 10:29.160
So you can hook up antennas directly to the ports that it comes with, and you're going

10:29.160 --> 10:32.520
to get something that's way faster than any Wi-Fi.

10:32.520 --> 10:37.480
You're going to get something that's screaming fast, and that's how I use it right now.

10:37.480 --> 10:42.400
But in about two weeks, I'm going to get the seven in one antenna installed on the roof.

10:42.400 --> 10:46.360
I'm going to have to drill a hole, which I'm very nervous about through my roof, and that

10:46.360 --> 10:52.400
will bring in external antenna into this guy, and I'll take off the little antenna that

10:52.400 --> 10:56.120
I have installed on it, and I will hook up the wires from the external antenna.

10:56.120 --> 11:00.920
That'll give me even more performance because it's outside the metal box.

11:00.920 --> 11:07.160
It has multiple antennas in it, and it'll probably give me about a 5 dB gain in cellular

11:07.160 --> 11:09.440
signal, which is huge.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.440
That's a massive gain.

11:10.440 --> 11:15.360
So your before speeds were what, and what are you hoping to get with this new antenna?

11:15.360 --> 11:19.000
So right now, with the current setup that I have where I'm just using the built-in antennas,

11:19.000 --> 11:25.960
I'm getting somewhere between real world, it depends on the carrier, but 60 to 90 megabits,

11:25.960 --> 11:26.960
which is pretty great.

11:26.960 --> 11:27.960
That's good.

11:27.960 --> 11:28.960
Yeah.

11:28.960 --> 11:29.960
I'm pretty happy with that.

11:29.960 --> 11:34.520
It's enough where you combine it with some of the other features this thing has, and

11:34.520 --> 11:36.560
it's really freaking cool.

11:36.560 --> 11:37.920
Let me tell you about the really freaking cool stuff.

11:37.920 --> 11:42.240
So I guess one other disclaimer is you've got to pay for the LTE, right?

11:42.240 --> 11:47.080
So I have an unlimited AT&T SIM in this thing, and I have an unlimited Verizon SIM in this

11:47.080 --> 11:48.080
thing.

11:48.080 --> 11:52.080
And then I have a Google Fi data-only SIM, which are awesome, by the way, if you're a

11:52.080 --> 11:53.840
Google Fi customer.

11:53.840 --> 11:55.880
You just get a data SIM and just pay for its usage.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.520
I have that as a failover device.

11:57.520 --> 11:58.520
Oh.

11:58.520 --> 11:59.520
Yeah.

11:59.520 --> 12:00.520
I'm going to do that.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.160
Catherine has a Pixel with Fi.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.680
I need a SIM card for my iPad.

12:03.680 --> 12:04.680
I didn't know you could do that.

12:04.680 --> 12:05.680
Yeah.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.480
You've got to be a current Fi customer to get it.

12:07.480 --> 12:08.480
Yeah.

12:08.480 --> 12:09.480
Well, she is.

12:09.480 --> 12:10.480
I'm going to do that.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.480
Thank you for that tip.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.480
It's pretty great.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.200
So the peplink itself runs their own OS.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.880
They put a super nice processor in this.

12:16.880 --> 12:17.880
It's very fast.

12:17.880 --> 12:23.120
I have no complaints about performance, which is not an easy bar for me.

12:23.120 --> 12:28.400
I'm pretty sensitive to slow-loading admin pages and whatnot.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.900
But one of the things that pushed me over the link on going with this setup versus what

12:31.900 --> 12:36.360
I had before, which originally was a travel slate router, and then I kind of replaced

12:36.360 --> 12:44.080
that with a Raspberry Pi 4 that was doing kind of a bonded VPN sort of, which worked.

12:44.080 --> 12:50.640
But I needed something that was 100%, something that I could rely to run a security system,

12:50.640 --> 12:55.800
something that if I'm not home and my kids are home and they're doing school, I don't

12:55.800 --> 12:59.640
have to get a frantic call from my wife saying the internet's gone down again and I walk

12:59.640 --> 13:01.200
her through rebooting a MiFi.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.120
I wanted it rock solid.

13:03.120 --> 13:07.520
And one of the things that they build into this, you have to pay for it, but it's what

13:07.520 --> 13:10.920
they call speed fusion technology.

13:10.920 --> 13:18.340
And it is a bonding VPN that very, very cleverly bonds your two LTE connections.

13:18.340 --> 13:22.600
And it's aware of the data going over both and it's aware of the individual performance

13:22.600 --> 13:24.680
characteristics of each connection.

13:24.680 --> 13:29.480
And it will intelligently balance and bond these two connections into one.

13:29.480 --> 13:32.200
So how does that work with stuff like cookies and things like that?

13:32.200 --> 13:35.920
Because I've often run into this issue, well, this used to be something I did when I was

13:35.920 --> 13:36.920
back in college.

13:36.920 --> 13:42.720
We used to flash a couple of cable modems with a spoofed Mac address and we used PF

13:42.720 --> 13:47.880
Sense with multi WANs and that caused loads of issues when it did a round robin balance

13:47.880 --> 13:51.720
between different connections, different WAN connections.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.760
Does this kind of have like a sticky feature?

13:53.760 --> 14:00.560
Well, the way it is really working is what it's doing is their own custom source VPN.

14:00.560 --> 14:07.480
So your endpoint is what all of the client websites and services see as your IP.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.080
Oh, that's smart.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.760
Yeah, I like that.

14:10.760 --> 14:17.200
The downside is you have to either pay them to host it, which they offer multiple servers

14:17.200 --> 14:21.940
across various VPS providers that they've abstracted throughout everywhere.

14:21.940 --> 14:27.520
There's also other companies that are now around that just offer VPN endpoints for these

14:27.520 --> 14:30.880
routers because they're pretty common in industrial use.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.920
And so there's a good amount of enterprise customers out there that are willing to pay

14:33.920 --> 14:39.840
$200 a month for something like this, which is mind boggling to me because it's really

14:39.840 --> 14:41.240
just a VPN.

14:41.240 --> 14:46.460
And you've got these people that are charging $150 to $200 a month for the service.

14:46.460 --> 14:49.720
They do allow you and they have different licensing options.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.920
Some are more affordable than others to just self host as well.

14:52.920 --> 14:53.920
That's very cool.

14:53.920 --> 14:54.920
What's the VPN tech they're using?

14:54.920 --> 14:57.520
Is it WireGuard or OpenVPN?

14:57.520 --> 14:59.640
I wonder if it's OpenVPN.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.360
I haven't dug super deep into it.

15:01.360 --> 15:06.880
I did grab their self hosted VM image and I am in the process of testing that so I may

15:06.880 --> 15:08.660
be able to figure that out.

15:08.660 --> 15:10.600
I don't know if I will.

15:10.600 --> 15:14.900
They layer a lot of their own like signaling tech on top of it.

15:14.900 --> 15:16.880
So whatever it is, it's unique in that sense.

15:16.880 --> 15:21.960
Like for example, they have this technology that they call WAN smoothing, which duplicates

15:21.960 --> 15:25.960
packets, which sounds like it would take bandwidth, but stick with me for a second.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.960
And they call this forward error correction.

15:27.960 --> 15:32.400
It sends additional reserve packets, which can be used to mitigate the effects of packet

15:32.400 --> 15:34.600
loss via interpolation.

15:34.600 --> 15:41.180
The actual practical use case of that is your video calls are rock solid over LTE.

15:41.180 --> 15:48.320
And so I'm doing video calls, I'm using this connection for, I went off into the woods

15:48.320 --> 15:56.240
and there's a spot that is on a farm that is, you know, at least a hundred acres.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.960
And I don't know what it is about this spot.

15:57.960 --> 16:01.120
Well, actually I do know is on the Hill above, I actually saw it this trip.

16:01.120 --> 16:05.680
This is the third time I've been there and I finally found the cell tower and it's just,

16:05.680 --> 16:08.980
it's a beautiful line of sight cell tower to the camping spot.

16:08.980 --> 16:12.200
And I get 90 megabits on LTE.

16:12.200 --> 16:18.000
And it's just it, when you have a device that can handle very high performance LTE and it

16:18.000 --> 16:22.840
can handle 30, 40 wifi clients, which is what I actually have.

16:22.840 --> 16:27.960
And it can, it could manage all of this intelligently and it can determine, well, if you send something

16:27.960 --> 16:30.920
to Verizon and you're waiting for it to come back, I'll use the AT&T line.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.000
Like it figures all of that out for you.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
It's really nice.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Man.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
I need, I think I need that in my house.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.220
I mean, spectrum is just rubbish.

16:40.220 --> 16:42.080
So I put a link in the show notes.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.080
It wasn't fantastic.

16:43.080 --> 16:47.260
It wasn't, it wasn't amazing that I could still, I could still see some compression,

16:47.260 --> 16:55.040
but I played Red Dead Redemption over Stadia in the woods on an LTE connection.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.040
Wow.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.640
You are living in the future.

16:57.640 --> 16:58.640
That's fantastic.

16:58.640 --> 16:59.640
It was really good.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.200
I mean, there's some latency issues time.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.800
And every now and then I got a message from Stadia saying your connection is not that

17:03.800 --> 17:06.560
great, but it, you know, it works pretty solid.

17:06.560 --> 17:11.520
I don't think you are probably their target market when they, when they invented Stadia.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.140
No, no, I don't think so.

17:14.140 --> 17:18.080
The other thing that's just absolutely been brilliant and it was one of those why factors,

17:18.080 --> 17:21.340
you know, I do this change and she's like, yeah, it seems faster, right?

17:21.340 --> 17:26.240
But you're like, oh my God, like I put all this, I put all this time into research and

17:26.240 --> 17:31.600
spent a fair chunk of change on this thing and did all of this work to get it installed.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.800
You know, I had to switch over our DNS, I had to switch up our DHCP.

17:34.800 --> 17:38.600
I had to take out devices, you know, replace my SSID.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.480
Like I really, you know, put a lot into this thing.

17:41.480 --> 17:48.500
And her first response was it's kind of faster until we sat down and watched YouTube.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.840
And you have to understand how this works to fully appreciate this.

17:50.840 --> 17:55.800
On AT&T, YouTube gets slammed to 480p.

17:55.800 --> 18:00.560
It basically puts up a wall and the client, the YouTube client just smacks his head into

18:00.560 --> 18:08.180
that wall until it finally settles on 480p and then it streams you mud essentially.

18:08.180 --> 18:13.120
And it's annoying because you just sit there and the YouTube video player just spins while

18:13.120 --> 18:17.440
it has this confrontation with AT&T and then you get your crappy result.

18:17.440 --> 18:21.560
That's one of the reasons I love YouTube DL because I just download this stuff and watch

18:21.560 --> 18:22.560
it offline.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.360
Love YouTube DL with all this hoopla going on.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.660
I have faith.

18:26.660 --> 18:27.660
I have faith.

18:27.660 --> 18:28.660
Yeah, me too.

18:28.660 --> 18:33.460
But I'll tell you what, when you're going over the bonded VPN, AT&T has no idea what

18:33.460 --> 18:35.820
you're doing and YouTube doesn't care.

18:35.820 --> 18:42.280
And so the video starts immediately and it's full 1080p, beautiful, crispy, just boom.

18:42.280 --> 18:45.920
And so the wife and I were sitting there on the couch and we pull up YouTube to watch

18:45.920 --> 18:51.760
some of the creators that we follow and we hit play on that video and she goes, whoa,

18:51.760 --> 18:53.400
it's like we got a brand new TV.

18:53.400 --> 18:58.120
The picture quality just skyrocketed and that she noticed.

18:58.120 --> 19:01.880
And that, you know, when you're doing that once or twice a week, three times a week,

19:01.880 --> 19:04.960
whatever you're doing, like that kind of thing, it's like a quality of life improvement that

19:04.960 --> 19:07.380
she noticed.

19:07.380 --> 19:10.800
And then that kind of built on that and then she started noticing other things and now

19:10.800 --> 19:11.800
she loves it.

19:11.800 --> 19:19.180
And the very clever thing that this thing does, Alex, is it sets the bonded VPN on its

19:19.180 --> 19:20.380
own SSID.

19:20.380 --> 19:26.360
So you get a new wireless access point on your LAN and you join that and everything's

19:26.360 --> 19:27.360
the same.

19:27.360 --> 19:33.280
You're on the same LAN, same IP space, same DHCP server, same DNS, except for your default

19:33.280 --> 19:34.280
route.

19:34.280 --> 19:37.560
I'm not sure how they handle DNS in this case, but your default route gets set to the bonded

19:37.560 --> 19:38.960
VPN.

19:38.960 --> 19:44.780
So you have these, you have this new AP and you can put certain hosts on that AP and they

19:44.780 --> 19:48.560
go out the bonded VPN and everybody else just goes out the balanced connection, which that

19:48.560 --> 19:50.040
just automatically balances.

19:50.040 --> 19:56.160
So you just put the televisions on the bonded VPN and boom, streaming is just magic now,

19:56.160 --> 19:57.680
buttery smooth.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.960
It's so great.

20:00.960 --> 20:08.640
It reminds me a lot like when we did the solar and lithium battery upgrade last year and

20:08.640 --> 20:14.040
it just changed everything because now all of a sudden we always had power and all of

20:14.040 --> 20:18.200
our outlets, we went from having three outlets that worked when we were on battery and having

20:18.200 --> 20:21.100
two lead acid batteries and then two lithium batteries.

20:21.100 --> 20:28.440
Now we went to 600 amp hours of lithium and solar and it just changed everything.

20:28.440 --> 20:33.480
We could leave our smart lights on the automations and home assistant could be completely changed.

20:33.480 --> 20:39.080
It was a massive quality of life upgrade and it feels similar to that.

20:39.080 --> 20:44.160
It's just another huge improvement and for the kids, it just means everything works just

20:44.160 --> 20:49.160
like all the outlets work and we always can turn lights on and all of that and we can,

20:49.160 --> 20:51.520
we can leave a TV going if we want.

20:51.520 --> 20:56.800
Now the internet just works because if AT&T is having problems, it just switches to Verizon

20:56.800 --> 21:00.880
and Verizon's having problems, it switches to Google Fi and it just sorts it all out

21:00.880 --> 21:02.480
without me ever having to touch it.

21:02.480 --> 21:08.480
You have such a wonderfully unique set of problems to solve in an RV, don't you?

21:08.480 --> 21:09.480
What about Starlink though?

21:09.480 --> 21:12.000
Isn't that going to change the game in a year or two?

21:12.000 --> 21:16.080
I hope, you know, I really, I hope it's maybe in a year.

21:16.080 --> 21:17.080
I don't know.

21:17.080 --> 21:18.080
We'll see.

21:18.080 --> 21:21.800
I imagine the last thing they're going to support is RVs because right now if you're

21:21.800 --> 21:28.200
a Starlink beta customer in the EULA, it says that you have to use the Starlink service

21:28.200 --> 21:34.160
where you signed up and I don't know if they're doing like geo checking or not, you know,

21:34.160 --> 21:38.520
maybe they sure could be and so in there it says you use it where you signed up and I

21:38.520 --> 21:43.120
think, I don't know, maybe it's, maybe they don't have the tech right on repositioning

21:43.120 --> 21:46.960
the satellite when you move or something like that and the other thing to think about Starlink

21:46.960 --> 21:53.100
is it won't be usable while you're going down the road or if there's a lot of tree coverage.

21:53.100 --> 21:56.880
So I think this will still fill those gaps in even once Starlink arrives.

21:56.880 --> 22:00.720
Have you ever gone outside and watched the Starlink trainer satellites go over?

22:00.720 --> 22:01.720
It's pretty cool.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.120
I have never seen it.

22:03.120 --> 22:08.460
Every time I look on a night sky on my phone, it's always underneath me.

22:08.460 --> 22:09.460
It's awesome.

22:09.460 --> 22:14.480
I'll tell you what, we went out a few weeks ago and every, you know, 10 seconds or so

22:14.480 --> 22:19.960
there's another satellite goes over and they're just all in a long line and it's just, it's

22:19.960 --> 22:23.880
amazing and you think to yourself, well, okay, now I've got visibility of that satellite

22:23.880 --> 22:29.720
for maybe a minute as it goes over and then you know that they've got like some kind of

22:29.720 --> 22:34.680
mesh network between them and communicating so that they're doing some kind of like zero

22:34.680 --> 22:38.360
handoff type style thing between the satellites.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.240
It's very cool.

22:40.240 --> 22:41.240
Crazy cool.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.760
They're doing a lot of beta testing here in Washington state.

22:43.760 --> 22:48.720
So I've been getting little bits of information and you know, people are seeing decent speeds

22:48.720 --> 22:55.400
20 millisecond ping time, which is doable and a hundred megabits on a, on a good night

22:55.400 --> 22:56.720
of unlimited data.

22:56.720 --> 22:57.720
Yeah.

22:57.720 --> 23:03.120
My, my, my worry really is that, you know, satellite is very, very easily disrupted by

23:03.120 --> 23:08.280
weather or trees or something like that, you know, so yeah, a cable is always going to

23:08.280 --> 23:13.720
be better, but you know, it could open up possibilities for new economies of, of people

23:13.720 --> 23:19.200
moving to rural Montana and stuff and working, you know, for a Facebook or an Apple or a

23:19.200 --> 23:21.080
Google or whoever or a red hat.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.320
Oh, it's my dream.

23:22.320 --> 23:23.320
It's my dream.

23:23.320 --> 23:24.320
Yeah, man.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.320
Me too.

23:25.320 --> 23:29.440
Like, I mean, I live in Raleigh right now, but you know, there's no reason besides the,

23:29.440 --> 23:31.040
you know, social things that you can do here.

23:31.040 --> 23:35.360
Like you can go to the cinema and well, not the moment, but anyway, you get the idea,

23:35.360 --> 23:36.360
right?

23:36.360 --> 23:42.680
Like we live in cities, but there are also reasons to kind of think about that fully

23:42.680 --> 23:48.240
remote off-grid style lifestyle, but there's also that kind of middle ground of I'm going

23:48.240 --> 23:53.800
to live within half an hour's drive of a town and then, you know, have a few acres to myself

23:53.800 --> 23:56.880
and, you know, I think I would love that.

23:56.880 --> 23:57.880
I would love that.

23:57.880 --> 24:03.160
I just spent Thursday through Sunday off-grid, you know, it's funny because when we started

24:03.160 --> 24:06.640
the show, I, the, the RV was just not off-grid capable, right?

24:06.640 --> 24:11.400
And you remember I launched project off-grid and yeah, and now I'm living it.

24:11.400 --> 24:18.680
We went off into the woods and it is, it's about 45 minutes from town.

24:18.680 --> 24:20.080
It is very remote.

24:20.080 --> 24:22.280
It's you don't see another soul.

24:22.280 --> 24:25.920
It's a giant forest you can walk around in and there's, you know, there's wildlife, there's

24:25.920 --> 24:28.640
bears and there's, there's things like that to be aware of.

24:28.640 --> 24:34.760
But when I'm out there at this, this time, it made me realize, I think I could pull this

24:34.760 --> 24:36.800
off on an ongoing basis.

24:36.800 --> 24:44.080
Like, I think I could buy a chunk of land that didn't have utilities and I could live

24:44.080 --> 24:45.080
there.

24:45.080 --> 24:48.040
I would probably build a little shed with solar and some additional supplemental batteries.

24:48.040 --> 24:52.400
So maybe I could double my battery capacity while I was there and I might need an extra

24:52.400 --> 24:55.260
large propane tank for the winter.

24:55.260 --> 25:01.120
But outside of that, I have, as long as I have cell signal now and it's reasonable to

25:01.120 --> 25:03.360
get into town or Starlink, right?

25:03.360 --> 25:04.980
It's getting really close.

25:04.980 --> 25:05.980
It's happening.

25:05.980 --> 25:10.680
I saw an article, I don't know what website it was on, maybe New York Times or something,

25:10.680 --> 25:19.320
where Bozeman, Montana is seeing, you know, 16% year over year real estate price growth.

25:19.320 --> 25:20.320
Yeah.

25:20.320 --> 25:25.760
I went to Bozeman just a few months ago and I go every year, I went twice this year and

25:25.760 --> 25:31.800
it is just, even during Corona with lockdowns, it has, it has changed every year significantly

25:31.800 --> 25:33.280
and it's going through major growth.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.880
I talked to a real estate agent at a pizza place, of all things, I'm sitting there eating

25:36.880 --> 25:41.400
pizza and I'm talking to a owner of a business at the pizza place and I'm talking to the

25:41.400 --> 25:45.280
real estate agent and he said, the thing he said is that people are getting these places

25:45.280 --> 25:48.700
and they're just kind of doing the off-grid lifestyle and they're doing exactly what you're

25:48.700 --> 25:50.060
talking about.

25:50.060 --> 25:53.480
And you know, I am thinking, you know, it could happen.

25:53.480 --> 25:59.100
I mean, a year ago I was just figuring out how to even use solar and now I just basically

25:59.100 --> 26:02.100
spent nearly a week off-grid loving it.

26:02.100 --> 26:05.640
So it just has to have connectivity, but with Starlink it changes it.

26:05.640 --> 26:08.760
And I really debated, should I build this towards 5G?

26:08.760 --> 26:13.260
Because that's an example of a decision where I could have gone a little more cutting edge

26:13.260 --> 26:18.200
here and because you could build a 5G system that's still fully LTE capable.

26:18.200 --> 26:23.740
And this speaks to what you said a few minutes ago of, you know, you're using the version

26:23.740 --> 26:28.320
of the tech that is, you know, not the latest and greatest that's got all the bugs worked

26:28.320 --> 26:30.720
out and that's what LTE is right now.

26:30.720 --> 26:31.720
Yeah.

26:31.720 --> 26:37.380
And it's got the most durable gear, the stuff that's built to go into industrial grade operations.

26:37.380 --> 26:41.000
The reality is if I could start getting ideal LTE connectivity, if I can start getting a

26:41.000 --> 26:46.360
hundred megabits on LTE, you know, and the system's capable of dual 600, but if I can

26:46.360 --> 26:50.640
get even a hundred megabits, that's plenty really.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.840
It's just the cost of those plans, right?

26:52.840 --> 26:53.840
Yes.

26:53.840 --> 26:54.840
Yeah, exactly.

26:54.840 --> 26:58.160
And maybe that changes as time goes on, you know, you go down the road five years from

26:58.160 --> 27:02.840
now when LTE will still be around, but the majority is now everyone's on 5G just because

27:02.840 --> 27:05.680
that's what all the phones have that are in operation.

27:05.680 --> 27:10.440
Maybe they, maybe they stop being such jerks about data usage on LTE.

27:10.440 --> 27:11.440
Maybe they don't really care.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.320
That's what happened with the edge network for years.

27:13.320 --> 27:17.960
Like edge went on for a decade and they just started letting people have full access to

27:17.960 --> 27:18.960
the edge network.

27:18.960 --> 27:22.040
And you started seeing all these little devices, little tracker devices and whatnot show up

27:22.040 --> 27:25.040
that used edge with unlimited data.

27:25.040 --> 27:26.280
And maybe that could happen.

27:26.280 --> 27:29.920
And then, you know, be a perfect, you know, three, four or five years from now would be

27:29.920 --> 27:33.200
a perfect time to upgrade the system.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.200
Linode.com slash SSH.

27:35.200 --> 27:39.900
You go there to support the show and receive a $100 60 day credit towards your new account.

27:39.900 --> 27:43.040
This episode of self-hosted is sponsored by Linode.

27:43.040 --> 27:46.960
The world's largest independent cloud for developers.

27:46.960 --> 27:52.000
Simplify your cloud infrastructure with Linode's Linux virtual machines and tools to develop,

27:52.000 --> 27:56.680
deploy and scale applications easier and faster than ever.

27:56.680 --> 27:59.320
I've been using Linode for over two years.

27:59.320 --> 28:04.560
I started right after I sold Jupiter broadcasting and I wanted to just separate work stuff and

28:04.560 --> 28:06.160
personal stuff.

28:06.160 --> 28:10.680
But then as we started to go independent again and I needed a lot of infrastructure fast

28:10.680 --> 28:17.000
and I mean, really it was a serious undertaking, Linode was my obvious choice.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.400
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.000
So they really know what they're doing.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.240
That's three years before AWS.

28:24.240 --> 28:28.040
And they're independently owned and founded that entire time.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.840
And you know that this is a good sign when it's a company that got into this business

28:31.840 --> 28:36.320
because they saw the technology that was being built into the Linux kernel and they knew

28:36.320 --> 28:39.400
what they could do with that and they started a company around that.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.480
I think that's really something special.

28:41.480 --> 28:47.480
And they've built such a manageable and usable system now with their cloud dashboard.

28:47.480 --> 28:50.960
I'm not going to spend hours and hours learning how to manage these systems.

28:50.960 --> 28:54.240
I can go in there and it's really easy to use.

28:54.240 --> 28:56.520
You don't have to have a very high skill level.

28:56.520 --> 29:00.640
But if you want, you can do everything through SSH.

29:00.640 --> 29:06.200
You get full access unlike entry level hosting services that lock you into their platform.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.400
It gives you full back end access to customize and control your server.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.480
So if you want it, it's there.

29:11.480 --> 29:14.920
And if Kubernetes is your thing, maybe you want to centralize your management a little

29:14.920 --> 29:20.320
bit, Linode's managed Kubernetes engine is simple and the pricing is simple.

29:20.320 --> 29:21.880
You only pay for what you use.

29:21.880 --> 29:26.940
And there's no management fees like AWS charges for their Kubernetes implementation.

29:26.940 --> 29:31.000
And with Linode's 99.9% SLA, you know you're going to be set.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
You know you're going to be okay with your infrastructure.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.820
That's why I run everything on there.

29:34.820 --> 29:38.600
And if you're going for something that you want that's customer facing, you've got a

29:38.600 --> 29:43.040
lot of great options from node balancers to object storage, different tools you can use

29:43.040 --> 29:45.560
to really make your performance super fast.

29:45.560 --> 29:49.040
Or maybe you just want to build something for yourself or for your family, an online

29:49.040 --> 29:51.360
gallery or a blog.

29:51.360 --> 29:56.040
Linode's got plans that make that really easy to starting at $5 a month.

29:56.040 --> 30:02.400
But if you go to linode.com slash SSH, you're going to get a $100 60 day credit.

30:02.400 --> 30:06.320
I'd encourage you to play with something with some horsepower.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.600
It's a great opportunity to learn too.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.520
Go build a website just as an experiment.

30:11.520 --> 30:12.720
Check out their stack scripts.

30:12.720 --> 30:17.800
It's a great way to get a really nice base WordPress setup up and going.

30:17.800 --> 30:21.320
And they've got a couple of options depending on if you want NGINX or Apache, and of course

30:21.320 --> 30:23.560
you've got all the different distros to choose from.

30:23.560 --> 30:24.640
So go check that out too.

30:24.640 --> 30:26.200
It's a great way to get up and going.

30:26.200 --> 30:30.280
And with 11 data centers worldwide, you're going to find just the right spot to deploy

30:30.280 --> 30:33.300
something that's going to be either close to you or close to your clients.

30:33.300 --> 30:36.320
So go over to linode.com slash SSH.

30:36.320 --> 30:40.660
Receive that $100 60 day credit towards your new account and support the show.

30:40.660 --> 30:42.560
And simplify your cloud life.

30:42.560 --> 30:46.640
Linode's been around since 2003, and they're dedicated to offering the best virtualized

30:46.640 --> 30:47.640
cloud computing.

30:47.640 --> 30:50.520
If it runs on Linux, you can run it on Linode.

30:50.520 --> 30:52.480
Linode.com slash SSH.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.100
Big thank you Linode for sponsoring the show.

30:54.100 --> 31:00.200
Go get your $100 60 day credit, linode.com slash SSH.

31:00.200 --> 31:01.600
And with some feedback, do you think?

31:01.600 --> 31:03.440
Yeah, it's been a little bit.

31:03.440 --> 31:06.000
And now that we're in our early thirties, we got to start paying attention to these

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
kinds of things.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Alex.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
Early thirties.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
Sure.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Wink, wink.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Squirrely wrote in.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
He says, uh, this is on discord by the way.

31:13.000 --> 31:18.900
I have six, eight terabyte drives at the moment, but I just picked up two 12 terabyte drives

31:18.900 --> 31:20.160
on sale.

31:20.160 --> 31:21.160
Nice.

31:21.160 --> 31:25.680
What are some options for how to incorporate these new drives into my environment?

31:25.680 --> 31:30.160
I have the eight terabyte drives protected via a single snap rate parody set up right

31:30.160 --> 31:34.440
now, but I'm curious as to whether this is still the best route in 2020.

31:34.440 --> 31:38.760
The vast majority of my stuff on my NAS is replaceable via media.

31:38.760 --> 31:43.040
So I was thinking about putting the truly important stuff on a mirror or something that

31:43.040 --> 31:45.880
will also get backed up with something like Backblaze.

31:45.880 --> 31:47.480
What are your thoughts, gentlemen?

31:47.480 --> 31:48.480
Interesting question.

31:48.480 --> 31:49.480
Yeah.

31:49.480 --> 31:52.080
So we had this discussion a little bit on, on discord, but I thought it was going to

31:52.080 --> 31:56.280
be useful to relay this to the audience as well.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.960
And there's a few different routes you can go.

31:58.960 --> 32:04.360
So you're already using snap rate and the process of adding new disks to snap rate is,

32:04.360 --> 32:09.640
is quite straightforward until you start to mess around with drive sizes.

32:09.640 --> 32:15.000
Like you have here, you know, you had six, eight terabyte drives and now you've changed

32:15.000 --> 32:17.960
and added a couple of 12 terabyte drives.

32:17.960 --> 32:23.800
One of the requirements of snap rate is that your parity disk has to be as large or larger

32:23.800 --> 32:26.400
than your largest data disk.

32:26.400 --> 32:30.080
So currently your parity drive is an eight terabyte drive.

32:30.080 --> 32:34.960
You're going to have to swap that out to be one of these new 12 terabyte drives.

32:34.960 --> 32:39.520
So what that means is that you're effectively giving up a little bit of space to parity

32:39.520 --> 32:45.160
in the short term, but as you expand and buy more 12 terabyte disks over the next year

32:45.160 --> 32:52.280
or two, you'll be able to add those into the snap rate array for want of a better word.

32:52.280 --> 32:55.160
And that should just work just fine.

32:55.160 --> 33:00.720
So that's an important consideration, but the last part of your questions is, is about

33:00.720 --> 33:07.280
should I put stuff on a mirror or, or have something backed up with, with backblaze what's

33:07.280 --> 33:13.460
important to remember is that raid or snap raid or any kind of parity system, whether

33:13.460 --> 33:18.920
it's ZFS or whatever, is no replacement for a real backup.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.920
Raid is not backup.

33:20.920 --> 33:26.080
We've pushed this mantra for years as a community and I just want to implore you to, you know,

33:26.080 --> 33:30.800
remember that parity is not, raid is not a backup.

33:30.800 --> 33:36.360
So having an offsite is, is absolutely something I would suggest, you know, you could do the,

33:36.360 --> 33:43.000
the G suite hack, although there was some news about that is changing the terms of service

33:43.000 --> 33:44.760
with G suite stuff is changing.

33:44.760 --> 33:50.600
So we'll dig into that more in a future episode, but you know, backblaze do offer some really

33:50.600 --> 33:52.280
competitive prices for backups.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.680
So that's a really good option as well.

33:53.680 --> 33:58.000
There's, there's loads of other backup services as well, but make sure you have an offsite

33:58.000 --> 34:02.640
backup would be a recommendation of mine.

34:02.640 --> 34:07.900
Then the other option that you've got is to do what I do, which is I have a kind of a

34:07.900 --> 34:15.000
JBOD array of disks with merger FS, which are all of, you know, eight to 10 terabytes

34:15.000 --> 34:16.360
in size.

34:16.360 --> 34:22.280
And then I have a pair of drives, which are ZFS, which are mirrored.

34:22.280 --> 34:29.440
And then I combine that mirror into the merger FS pool of, of drives using a, a specific

34:29.440 --> 34:30.440
mount point.

34:30.440 --> 34:33.720
And as a blog post I've written on this, which is in the show notes.

34:33.720 --> 34:37.320
And so essentially what it allows me to do is keep my photos and my drone footage and

34:37.320 --> 34:45.280
the stuff that I can't reacquire that stuff stays on ZFS and is, you know, using a Sanoid.

34:45.280 --> 34:49.440
I mirror that to my parents' houses, stuff like that.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.920
And it gives me huge peace of mind.

34:51.920 --> 34:57.040
As I said, a couple of episodes ago, when I woke up and my ZFS array was blank, I was

34:57.040 --> 35:00.600
just like, Oh, she's annoying rather than, uh, I've actually lost data.

35:00.600 --> 35:03.800
So that's an important thing to consider as well.

35:03.800 --> 35:08.180
But when you're looking at the number of drives you have, you know, you've got six eights

35:08.180 --> 35:10.140
and two twelves.

35:10.140 --> 35:14.400
If you were to do a ZFS mirror with the two twelves that you have, if you do the math

35:14.400 --> 35:20.460
behind it, you're actually going to keep the same amount of available usable space by doing

35:20.460 --> 35:21.460
it that way.

35:21.460 --> 35:26.960
So my suggestion certainly to start with would probably be do a mirror of ZFS, free up some

35:26.960 --> 35:32.160
space on the, uh, the eight terabytes by moving some stuff off of that onto a new mirror that

35:32.160 --> 35:38.120
you've created and then, you know, uh, add drives as you see fit to the snap rate side

35:38.120 --> 35:39.120
of things.

35:39.120 --> 35:44.760
For my perishable data, it's like inconvenient to lose, but not going to wreck my life.

35:44.760 --> 35:46.640
I accomplished this through Butterfess.

35:46.640 --> 35:49.840
For better or worse, I find Butterfess to be a great way to manage this and you can

35:49.840 --> 35:54.360
just add mixed sized volumes to an existing mount point.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.760
You just plug it in and you add the volume.

35:55.760 --> 35:59.660
It's a really simple, straightforward process, but there's no redundancy there unless you

35:59.660 --> 36:01.120
do underlying rate.

36:01.120 --> 36:02.120
Tasty too.

36:02.120 --> 36:03.120
Yes.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.120
Very much so.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.120
So let's talk about a ZigBee future because Chris L wrote in about something that's been

36:07.120 --> 36:08.120
on my mind.

36:08.120 --> 36:12.640
He's been listening from the start, he says, and it's rich in all sorts of fabulous ideas,

36:12.640 --> 36:17.860
but ones that you've actually worked out, not just ones that you're theorizing about.

36:17.860 --> 36:19.560
To some degree, there's a little bit of both, I'd say.

36:19.560 --> 36:24.280
He said, I wanted to comment about episode 24, open makes sense.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.280
There are some discussion in there about Z-Wave.

36:26.280 --> 36:30.480
I think Chris commented that Z-Wave is used less and less as embedded devices have switched

36:30.480 --> 36:32.720
more to Wi-Fi.

36:32.720 --> 36:36.480
While this may be true, I thought I would share comments from a man who fitted the smart

36:36.480 --> 36:41.420
meter last month at my house, which is currently being rolled out across the UK.

36:41.420 --> 36:45.440
He goes on to say the different meters like gas and electric and the monitoring station

36:45.440 --> 36:51.520
all talk to each other on ZigBee, the open standard cousin of Z-Wave.

36:51.520 --> 36:55.700
And the central point he made is that the SIM card sends the data over a mobile network

36:55.700 --> 36:57.380
to the energy supplier.

36:57.380 --> 37:02.760
The main point being the Zmesh technologies are not being used less, but more as these

37:02.760 --> 37:06.720
meters are battery powered and expected to survive in service for a long time.

37:06.720 --> 37:07.720
Thanks for everything.

37:07.720 --> 37:08.720
Looking forward to the next show.

37:08.720 --> 37:14.600
Also, he didn't mention this, but the new round Amazon Echo, I think has ZigBee built

37:14.600 --> 37:16.040
into it as well.

37:16.040 --> 37:20.440
Is that part of being a central like home automation hub type thing?

37:20.440 --> 37:21.440
Yeah.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.840
So it can control the ZigBee devices.

37:23.840 --> 37:28.800
I agree, and I have ZigBee abilities on my home assistant.

37:28.800 --> 37:33.480
I even got a little ZigBee to MQTT adapter, which is pretty rad.

37:33.480 --> 37:38.980
However, in actual practical production, I found Z-Wave to work better.

37:38.980 --> 37:41.680
And you guys know me, I'm always going to go with the open standard first.

37:41.680 --> 37:46.040
That's why I went the ZigBee to MQTT route first.

37:46.040 --> 37:51.760
But having several devices, I have found Z-Wave to be iron clad, rock solid.

37:51.760 --> 37:55.640
Like I can have devices that have been missing from the network for three or four months,

37:55.640 --> 37:59.160
come back online and it sorts itself out and rebuilds the mesh network and everything's

37:59.160 --> 38:00.160
just working.

38:00.160 --> 38:01.700
I love it.

38:01.700 --> 38:06.120
And I would love to see ZigBee be just as good and reliable.

38:06.120 --> 38:09.560
And maybe as more vendors get serious about it and start to use it, that just happens

38:09.560 --> 38:10.560
over time.

38:10.560 --> 38:15.600
I don't currently have anything on the Z-Wave or ZigBee trains besides my Hue lights, I

38:15.600 --> 38:16.600
don't think.

38:16.600 --> 38:17.600
Right.

38:17.600 --> 38:18.600
Yeah, they use ZigBee, don't they?

38:18.600 --> 38:19.600
On the back end.

38:19.600 --> 38:23.360
There are things like that, that are consumer, quote unquote, products, but are actually

38:23.360 --> 38:25.000
just using ZigBee.

38:25.000 --> 38:31.320
The other notable new addition to the smart home communications world is Thread, which

38:31.320 --> 38:36.000
the new HomePod Mini support and Iroh Wi-Fi access points support.

38:36.000 --> 38:44.700
And Thread is another industry standard, open, low power communications technology that has

38:44.700 --> 38:49.120
been around for a while, just like ZigBee has, but more and more recently seems to be

38:49.120 --> 38:51.960
getting adoption by the mainstream vendors.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.600
It's a weird world out there.

38:53.600 --> 38:57.400
So there may be more to come in low powered communications outside of just Bluetooth.

38:57.400 --> 38:58.400
Good.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.040
Just what we need, another standard.

39:00.040 --> 39:01.040
Yeah.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.040
Yeah.

39:02.040 --> 39:05.480
So Michael wrote in and asked us to explain our view on local versus cloud.

39:05.480 --> 39:10.360
He says, you focus on privacy and self-hosting, but you also seem comfortable with Alexa,

39:10.360 --> 39:12.360
Google, and the Ring doorbell.

39:12.360 --> 39:15.920
Can you take a moment to explain the balance on a future show?

39:15.920 --> 39:16.920
Interesting question.

39:16.920 --> 39:20.960
We could get quite philosophical here if we were not careful.

39:20.960 --> 39:27.400
I generally speaking try to self-host first these days, obviously being a host of the

39:27.400 --> 39:31.480
show that's clearly now a part of the job description.

39:31.480 --> 39:38.400
But when I'm talking with family members and people at work or just generally people on

39:38.400 --> 39:44.360
the internet, I don't always suggest self-hosting because it comes with the overhead of you

39:44.360 --> 39:45.360
are the admin.

39:45.360 --> 39:50.760
Like when it goes down, as we've talked about in the last few episodes, when there's a problem,

39:50.760 --> 39:51.760
you're the one that's got to fix it.

39:51.760 --> 39:54.600
And sometimes that can be jolly inconvenient.

39:54.600 --> 40:00.580
So you've got to really weigh up the trade-off that you're going to make of your time and

40:00.580 --> 40:03.280
money and convenience and privacy.

40:03.280 --> 40:07.040
You've got to trade all those things off against each other for the particular use case that

40:07.040 --> 40:08.680
you're talking about.

40:08.680 --> 40:13.240
And lighting is quite low risk, but quite rewarding to automate.

40:13.240 --> 40:18.640
But the doors on your house, for example, if you screw up the automations there and

40:18.640 --> 40:25.160
you get locked out or locked in, let's say, it could be even worse.

40:25.160 --> 40:31.480
There are different situations where the cost of stuff going wrong is higher.

40:31.480 --> 40:37.320
So when you look at the privacy angle, you are just a single data point in a sea of noise

40:37.320 --> 40:39.580
to Amazon and Google.

40:39.580 --> 40:47.640
So you could argue that actually it doesn't matter if you are saying to your Google homes

40:47.640 --> 40:50.240
this, that, and the other, or your Alexa's this, that, and the other.

40:50.240 --> 40:55.880
You could argue that nobody's listening because you are one of X number of million people

40:55.880 --> 40:56.880
doing this.

40:56.880 --> 41:01.400
But at the same time, there is a microphone always listening in your house and you don't

41:01.400 --> 41:04.200
know they say what they're going to use it for.

41:04.200 --> 41:07.600
We don't know necessarily what it's going to be used for.

41:07.600 --> 41:12.360
So there is that to consider as well, I mean, there isn't one right answer to this question.

41:12.360 --> 41:17.880
It's it's you have to evaluate your own risk profile for these sorts of things and figure

41:17.880 --> 41:20.120
out what works for you and your beliefs and values.

41:20.120 --> 41:22.520
Yeah, it's like so many things in life.

41:22.520 --> 41:24.500
It comes down to getting the balance right.

41:24.500 --> 41:26.320
And that balance is different for each people.

41:26.320 --> 41:27.320
It's like dieting.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.680
It's just different people.

41:28.680 --> 41:33.800
A balance of intake and exercise is generally that you got to get that just right.

41:33.800 --> 41:34.800
Yeah.

41:34.800 --> 41:35.800
Pizza a day keeps the doctor away, right?

41:35.800 --> 41:36.800
That's the saying.

41:36.800 --> 41:37.800
Right.

41:37.800 --> 41:38.800
Right.

41:38.800 --> 41:44.160
And I think it's the same for not just cloud services, but privacy and security in general.

41:44.160 --> 41:48.160
So there is some areas where for me, it's just it's a no brainer.

41:48.160 --> 41:50.840
I always run a local DNS server.

41:50.840 --> 41:55.020
The benefits of that is literally everything I do on the Internet just is just that tiny

41:55.020 --> 41:57.780
bit faster and it feels private.

41:57.780 --> 42:00.360
And it's something I know how to do intrinsically.

42:00.360 --> 42:04.080
Now it's I know the ins and outs of it and I can get it going in 15 minutes.

42:04.080 --> 42:06.120
So obvious one.

42:06.120 --> 42:10.920
I have not hosted my own email in a decade.

42:10.920 --> 42:14.800
It is just something that I feel like the risk profile is higher.

42:14.800 --> 42:20.560
The attack surface is high and then the pain in the arsonist is extreme because of spam

42:20.560 --> 42:24.800
blacklisting and all of that crap that you end up having to deal with.

42:24.800 --> 42:29.240
And so that is something where I've made a judgment call to outsource.

42:29.240 --> 42:31.020
Same with cloud backup.

42:31.020 --> 42:34.520
I think it's good to have your own backup regime that's local that you can have immediate

42:34.520 --> 42:35.920
access to.

42:35.920 --> 42:40.400
But it makes sense to also leverage cheap cloud storage that's off site that protects

42:40.400 --> 42:42.400
you from natural disaster, et cetera.

42:42.400 --> 42:45.600
There is an obvious kind of balance to be had there.

42:45.600 --> 42:48.380
And I kind of look at all of these things.

42:48.380 --> 42:54.200
Let's to address like the ring one, for example, I think this is one where we kind of we kind

42:54.200 --> 43:00.240
of get lost in the story a little bit and we hear stories about cops doing subpoenas

43:00.240 --> 43:09.640
and getting a block's door camera footage and that being bad and privacy invasive.

43:09.640 --> 43:13.880
So the reality is, is that somewhere in the middle there is a process when you have a

43:13.880 --> 43:17.280
ring doorbell where they can request access to your footage.

43:17.280 --> 43:20.080
You can deny or approve it via the app.

43:20.080 --> 43:22.960
You can determine if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

43:22.960 --> 43:26.000
And there's the privacy aspect of a third party hosting those videos as well.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.160
And you can determine if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

43:28.160 --> 43:32.600
And I think it all just kind of depends on your sense of the company, their risk profile

43:32.600 --> 43:33.600
and all of that.

43:33.600 --> 43:37.040
And that's, you know, an always moving target as well.

43:37.040 --> 43:40.960
So if I think if you choose to host, like, say, a doorbell or something with a company

43:40.960 --> 43:44.480
like ring, you have to continually assess the risk.

43:44.480 --> 43:48.100
It's not something you can just look at once and continually assess.

43:48.100 --> 43:52.320
So there's downsides to it as well beyond just the privacy aspects of it.

43:52.320 --> 43:56.640
There's that overhead of always needing to be cognizant of what's going on and reassessing.

43:56.640 --> 44:05.280
But the balance for me, I tend to be a little more practical, I tend to be a pragmatist

44:05.280 --> 44:06.280
when I look at these things.

44:06.280 --> 44:10.560
And I don't get overly concerned about the privacy story around some of these things

44:10.560 --> 44:12.520
like others do.

44:12.520 --> 44:14.520
But that's just different for each of us.

44:14.520 --> 44:19.960
The other thing as well is that companies change, like Chris says, you know, look at

44:19.960 --> 44:25.040
Nest with their works with Nest API situation, and then you end up with nine months, nearly

44:25.040 --> 44:30.000
a year where there is no API whilst Google figures out what they're doing with Nest and,

44:30.000 --> 44:34.160
you know, companies get bought and acquired and closed down and change priorities and

44:34.160 --> 44:40.960
focus all the time and, you know, you've just got to bear in mind that if you buy a product

44:40.960 --> 44:45.920
now that is subsidized with a cloud subscription or something like that, there is no incentive

44:45.920 --> 44:51.160
for that company, unless you're paying them money every month to keep offering that service.

44:51.160 --> 44:55.360
And sometimes even if you are paying them, it's not enough to be sustainable.

44:55.360 --> 44:59.200
So well said, the only constant with your self-hosted home is going to be that things

44:59.200 --> 45:00.200
are going to change.

45:00.200 --> 45:01.200
Yeah.

45:01.200 --> 45:04.560
I mean, I think it's like you said earlier, it's always preferable if I can, if it's

45:04.560 --> 45:09.040
something that my business relies on or something that is really critical to me, something I'm

45:09.040 --> 45:13.840
really concerned about the privacy, like my internal cameras to my RV are completely disconnected

45:13.840 --> 45:16.120
from the cloud.

45:16.120 --> 45:20.440
I think that's where self-hosting can play a really significant role, especially for

45:20.440 --> 45:21.440
businesses.

45:21.440 --> 45:23.120
I think that's something businesses should think a lot about.

45:23.120 --> 45:24.120
Yeah.

45:24.120 --> 45:27.240
There's no reason the internet needs to see Chris walking around in his robe, is there?

45:27.240 --> 45:29.680
No, no, no, there's not.

45:29.680 --> 45:34.740
And the other thing too is the other line I sometimes consider is, would I deploy this

45:34.740 --> 45:37.400
if it wasn't all like a cloud provided service?

45:37.400 --> 45:40.560
If, you know, they didn't take care of all of the implementation details, would I ever

45:40.560 --> 45:42.600
get around to doing this?

45:42.600 --> 45:45.760
And that's something I consider as well.

45:45.760 --> 45:51.320
Datadog.com slash self-hosted, today's episode of self-hosted is sponsored by Datadog.

45:51.320 --> 45:56.600
The unified monitoring platform for real time observability and detailed insights into Docker

45:56.600 --> 45:58.440
performance and more.

45:58.440 --> 46:03.460
Enhance visibility into container orchestration with live container view and easily detect

46:03.460 --> 46:08.560
clusters that are consuming excessive resources using auto-generated container maps.

46:08.560 --> 46:13.040
Out of the box, Datadog will collect critical metrics from each Docker container so you

46:13.040 --> 46:18.400
can get immediate visibility into aggregated and dis-aggregated service level traffic.

46:18.400 --> 46:23.260

I actually still have a Datadog t-shirt from DockerCon Europe 2015, I think.

46:39.840 --> 46:40.840
That's great.

46:40.840 --> 46:45.400
I've definitely picked up swag from the Datadog booth at a few events.

46:45.400 --> 46:50.240
You know, I've used Datadog just from a keeping track of systems and metrics standpoint, but

46:50.240 --> 46:52.280
I like this new stuff they have for containers too.

46:52.280 --> 46:58.280
So go check them out if you haven't tried Datadog before, datadog.com slash self-hosted.

46:58.280 --> 47:02.440
So following up on a previous episode where I talked about the new Chromecast with Google

47:02.440 --> 47:09.200
TV, they've released an ethernet adapter, which turns out is a bag of crap.

47:09.200 --> 47:11.800
Oh, really? Because it looks so slick.

47:11.800 --> 47:12.800
Yeah.

47:12.800 --> 47:16.600
Well, I was watching a YouTube video yesterday, so I haven't personally tested it out.

47:16.600 --> 47:23.440
It's just based on a YouTube video, but the ethernet speeds are capped at 100 meg.

47:23.440 --> 47:24.440
Stop it.

47:24.440 --> 47:25.440
Not even gigabit.

47:25.440 --> 47:26.440
Yep.

47:26.440 --> 47:27.440
Apparently so.

47:27.440 --> 47:28.440
I'm looking at the specs.

47:28.440 --> 47:29.440
You're right.

47:29.440 --> 47:30.440
You're right.

47:30.440 --> 47:33.080
Now in reality, is that going to be an issue?

47:33.080 --> 47:34.080
It's 2020.

47:34.080 --> 47:36.820
Why are we putting up with a device that isn't gigabit?

47:36.820 --> 47:42.640
It probably saves Google a few pennies from using a gigabit adapter instead of a megabit

47:42.640 --> 47:43.640
adapter.

47:43.640 --> 47:47.800
What they've done here that's super neat, though, is it looks just like a standard tiny

47:47.800 --> 47:53.080
white USB-C power adapter, but on the side of it, it has an ethernet port.

47:53.080 --> 47:58.000
So you plug the ethernet into the power adapter and then it all comes back up one USB-C cable

47:58.000 --> 47:59.160
to the Chromecast.

47:59.160 --> 48:06.020
I also saw a guy doing like a USB-C hub and it had a power delivery because the Chromecast

48:06.020 --> 48:07.920
needs 7.5 watts.

48:07.920 --> 48:13.840
You have to have a power delivery-supportable hub to put that much juice through it.

48:13.840 --> 48:18.000
And the gigabit speeds were not capable of gigabit either.

48:18.000 --> 48:23.200
So I don't know if there's some performance limitation on the USB bus inside the Chromecast

48:23.200 --> 48:29.520
because he was getting about 300 megabits from his Wi-Fi connection using AC Wi-Fi,

48:29.520 --> 48:34.840
but then he used ethernet through USB-C, not even the actual official Chromecast adapter,

48:34.840 --> 48:37.840
and he was only getting something like 180 to 200 meg.

48:37.840 --> 48:42.080
So it was actually slower in both cases being wired, which is just wrong.

48:42.080 --> 48:48.920
It just dawned on me that we just assume it's USB 3 because it's a USB-C connector in there,

48:48.920 --> 48:52.480
but maybe they saved money and put USB 2 in the thing.

48:52.480 --> 48:53.680
That's got to be it, hasn't it?

48:53.680 --> 48:54.800
That's got to be the answer.

48:54.800 --> 48:55.800
It could be.

48:55.800 --> 48:56.800
It could be.

48:56.800 --> 48:57.800
Oh, Google.

48:57.800 --> 48:58.800
Let me ask you this, though.

48:58.800 --> 49:03.680
Seriously, is a hundred megabit wired connection not still better though than Wi-Fi for what

49:03.680 --> 49:04.680
you're doing with this thing?

49:04.680 --> 49:05.680
Yeah, I guess it depends.

49:05.680 --> 49:09.920
I mean, Google have engineered this thing to be on Wi-Fi.

49:09.920 --> 49:13.120
Ninety nine percent of customers will use it on Wi-Fi, haven't they?

49:13.120 --> 49:14.520
So I don't know.

49:14.520 --> 49:19.680
I've not noticed any performance difference between my wired shield and my Wi-Fi Chromecast.

49:19.680 --> 49:20.680
It's right.

49:20.680 --> 49:23.400
It's like if you're not going to get gigabit, then might as well just keep using N. It's

49:23.400 --> 49:24.400
pretty good.

49:24.400 --> 49:25.400
Mm hmm.

49:25.400 --> 49:26.400
Yeah.

49:26.400 --> 49:27.400
I will.

49:27.400 --> 49:29.400
Bart writes in with potential pick replacement for you, too.

49:29.400 --> 49:32.960
So this is our last email and it also is going to be a bit of a pick.

49:32.960 --> 49:33.960
He says, hello, friends.

49:33.960 --> 49:34.960
Thanks for the show.

49:34.960 --> 49:38.120
It helps me get a great deal of home automation ideas for my home.

49:38.120 --> 49:42.680
I've been looking for Chromecast alternatives, though, and lo and behold, quite recently

49:42.680 --> 49:44.840
someone came up with this beauty.

49:44.840 --> 49:46.440
It's called Nymphcast.

49:46.440 --> 49:48.120
Seemed right up the self-hosted crowd alley.

49:48.120 --> 49:53.160
I for one certainly am going to build it and take it for a spin with my Pi zeros I have

49:53.160 --> 49:54.160
in a drawer somewhere.

49:54.160 --> 50:00.680
So this thing is essentially a build it yourself using Raspberry Pi zero stream audio and video

50:00.680 --> 50:03.920
anywhere around your house using any Linux system.

50:03.920 --> 50:07.280
Kind of like a universal DIY Chromecast.

50:07.280 --> 50:09.600
That is super cool.

50:09.600 --> 50:12.120
I think we've needed something like this for quite a long time.

50:12.120 --> 50:16.380
Yeah, I like this because it's not just something that's like figuring out the Chromecast protocols

50:16.380 --> 50:17.520
and using that.

50:17.520 --> 50:23.440
But this is a full fledged open replacement and it seems surprisingly well thought out

50:23.440 --> 50:26.920
and further along than I would think.

50:26.920 --> 50:27.920
It's really in-depth.

50:27.920 --> 50:32.000
It's an alpha stage right now, but you can download the server binaries from GitHub.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.000
Yeah.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.680
I've designed Linux images too, so I could see this being really easy to container up

50:36.680 --> 50:41.360
if it isn't already and just have the server running as a container on your media box.

50:41.360 --> 50:44.880
And we'll have a link to that in the show notes at self-hosted.show slash 31.

50:44.880 --> 50:49.920
And I want to say thank you to our self-hosted site reliability engineers who keep this show

50:49.920 --> 50:51.540
online and going.

50:51.540 --> 50:57.320
They also get a limited ad feed and they get extra content every episode, a post show.

50:57.320 --> 51:01.960
If you'd like to support the show, help us stay independent and be choosy about who sponsors.

51:01.960 --> 51:04.480
Sign up at self-hosted.show slash SRE.

51:04.480 --> 51:05.480
Yeah.

51:05.480 --> 51:06.480
Big thank you guys.

51:06.480 --> 51:07.480
Thank you very much.

51:07.480 --> 51:08.480
Yeah.

51:08.480 --> 51:12.940
As always, you can go to self-hosted.show slash contact to get in touch with us.

51:12.940 --> 51:15.320
You can find me on Twitter at ironic badger.

51:15.320 --> 51:19.500
And I'm there at Chris Elias and the show is at self-hosted show.

51:19.500 --> 51:20.900
Thanks very much for listening everybody.

51:20.900 --> 51:35.480
That was self-hosted dot show slash 31.
