1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
2022, it's here with a bang.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,960
We've dragged in our favorite Canadian out of the cold.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,360
Welcome back, Brent.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,360
Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,240
And Chris, as always, how are you doing?

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,120
Happy new year, sir.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,760
Hey, you know what?

8
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,400
I want to say thank you to the team that stepped in for the holiday 3D printing

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,800
episode, that was a lot of fun.

10
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,080
And now, I mean, it feels like I haven't done this forever.

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,600
Yeah, who are you again?

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,720
What is this thing in front of my face?

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,040
Well, I thought maybe if I brought Brent with me, I'd be accepted back.

14
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,640
Maybe we'll see.

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,720
The jury is still out on that one.

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,320
It always works with Alex.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,960
The quickest way to Alex's heart is through a Brent.

18
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, it's true.

19
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,640
Also, video games, you know, my favorite game of all time, I think, is probably

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,440
Factorio, but I potentially have a new one, which is vying for a top spot at the

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,760
moment, it's called Anno1800, have either of you played this game?

22
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,440
Oh, this is the first I hear of it.

23
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,400
Yeah, same.

24
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,280
What kind of game is this?

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,640
It's a city builder where you manage like supply chains and that kind of thing.

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,840
Oh, it sounds like it's up your alley.

27
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,120
You're pretty much playing as the East India Trading Company, minus the slavery

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,680
part, so that's kind of nice.

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,080
But yeah, you just trade goods back and forth and build cities and yeah, it's a

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,200
fun, relaxing, single player game.

31
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,320
When was this released and how'd you hear of it?

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,920
Ages ago, I don't know when it was released exactly, but I think I heard

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,440
about it first when Linus of Tech Tip fame mentioned it on one of his videos

34
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,520
and I thought, oh, I'll go and check it out and downloaded a demo and liked it.

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,040
So I bought it.

36
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,560
It's kind of great when you discover a game that's been out for a while.

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,880
So that means it's got a couple of patches under its belt.

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,600
You can find stuff online.

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,480
There's a community, sort of a sweet spot, you know, you know, a game doesn't

40
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,680
have to be cutting edge brand new for it to be enjoyable.

41
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,000
Absolutely.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,840
Not speaking of stuff that's no longer cutting edge and brand new, I thought

43
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,880
I'd just do a quick bit of follow-up on the Linux Unplugged Predictions episode.

44
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,400
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make the recording of this year's

45
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,120
predictions episode itself, but I thought I'd follow up on the prediction

46
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,120
I made last year, about 20 terabyte hard drives being available, I think,

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,920
for 250 bucks at Best Buy.

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,800
That didn't quite pan out.

49
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,440
No, it didn't quite, did it?

50
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:16,720
No.

51
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,560
I mean, there was a few shenanigans going on that kind of scuppered my, my plans.

52
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,800
First of all, supply chain, obviously we all know at this point, what's

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,160
going on with the supply chain, but second of all, it was Chia.

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,720
We had a hard drive mining crypto coin come out of the woodwork.

55
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,600
Yeah, there's just no way with all that was going on, that was going to happen.

56
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,160
You think maybe you got a better shot this year?

57
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,600
No, but I'm just going to say it anyway.

58
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,160
I mean, I was trying to, you know, with this Anno 1800 game, I've got a 1080

59
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,760
TI graphics card, which I've had for several years now, which was actually

60
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,920
incidentally paid for originally by Bitcoin mining four years ago.

61
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,520
And now with this Anno 1800 game, I've been looking for a new GPU.

62
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,200
And I was looking, you know, just to see what was out there.

63
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,720
The cheapest 3080 that I could find was on Facebook marketplace near me for $1,800.

64
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,520
What is going on with that?

65
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,120
Ridiculous.

66
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,880
Yeah, we've been building a new replacement server here and the number

67
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,120
one cost because the audience has been so awesome by providing the main rigs

68
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,280
has been storage and the just a limited amount of storage.

69
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,440
So I had to buy a batch of two terabytes and a batch of four terabytes.

70
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,120
I wanted all four terabytes, obviously, and I had to buy them all at the same

71
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,920
price, which I'm not super comfortable with, but it's going to be in an array

72
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,000
in array array, so hopefully if one or two pops will be all right, but they're

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,080
all used this and, you know, we paid a fair amount for them, even buying in the

74
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,080
after, you know, whatever you call it, the lightly loved market, I assume,

75
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,200
because they're enterprise drives.

76
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,280
So I hope I hope the last.

77
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,960
I've just recently learned about this whole hard drive used market.

78
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,880
Is this Alex, do you think something's going to happen with this market?

79
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,480
Is this Alex, you think something worth even considering?

80
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,200
I mean, how cheap are we talking?

81
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,200
A 14 terabyte.

82
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,480
So here's my reference point.

83
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,480
A 14 terabyte easy store that I can shuck from Best Buy.

84
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,760
I think I picked one up before Christmas for about $190, $200, something like that.

85
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,480
I think it's also what is your risk tolerance and do you have a setup that

86
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,600
can tolerate one or two drives at least failing?

87
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,960
Yeah, that makes sense.

88
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,440
So the new server, do we keep that in mind?

89
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,560
Yeah, yeah, we can.

90
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,320
We can sustain a couple of dis failing.

91
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,080
I think in total, we're OK until three fail simultaneously.

92
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,200
And I normally wouldn't think that's likely, except for these are probably all

93
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,760
originally from the same manufacturing batch.

94
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,840
They're all the same exact hard drive, the same exact model, all bought at the same

95
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,400
exact time.

96
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,360
I thought that was a rule not to do that.

97
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,680
I'm pretty sure there's a rule against that, like the bathtub curve or something.

98
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

99
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,440
But beggars are definitely not choosers.

100
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,280
And in this case, that's what we got.

101
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,560
Have you considered calling your buddy Alex over here and shipping him a couple of hard

102
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,920
drives and then you could use some of his basement space as a offsite backup?

103
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,040
Maybe we could do that.

104
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,320
That'd be a fun project.

105
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,520
Now, I know this is a lot of power, but what about a full server potentially?

106
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,080
Why?

107
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,800
Well, because I think I might have one that I'm going to totally sink.

108
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,760
And I mean, but you know, I think he has more servers than hard drive space.

109
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,800
You're pretty offsite.

110
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,560
You know, that's a good offsite backup, you know, in terms of offsite backups go when

111
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,040
in the East.

112
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,680
I mean, if a nuke hit DC, would it come out as far as Raleigh?

113
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,400
Probably.

114
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,440
I don't know.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,520
I mean, if that happens, I think I probably got bigger problems, really.

116
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,560
Oh, I don't know.

117
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,280
I don't know.

118
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,080
You're on the West Coast.

119
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,560
I don't think the fallout would make it quite that far.

120
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,120
I'm joking.

121
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,640
Of course, there'll be bigger problems than that.

122
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,600
There's one or two mountains between us, I suppose.

123
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,960
Maybe I'll do all right.

124
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,720
And then really life should just go on as normal.

125
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,240
There would be no other repercussions.

126
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,760
No, I mean, if the federal government disappeared tomorrow, I don't think anybody would be too

127
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,080
upset.

128
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,580
Do you?

129
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,280
No, I just vote with blockchain.

130
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,640
I think that's what happened.

131
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,560
Oh, so is that your prediction?

132
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,680
Was it 200?

133
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,160
What was it?

134
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,000
I think I missed the 20 terabyte easy store for 250.

135
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,720
Dollars or less.

136
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,280
Okay, okay.

137
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,840
Can I ask you what you think, Alex, your success rate might be?

138
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,680
Zero percent.

139
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,840
Oh, man, but he's doing it anyways.

140
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,120
A couple of years ago, I was pretty confident about it, but I don't know the way things

141
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,240
are at the minute and, you know, chip shortages and all that kind of stuff.

142
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,640
I'm not so sure anymore, but, you know, can't blame a guy for trying.

143
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,000
No.

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,640
What about diminishing returns when it comes to hard drive?

145
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:00,400
Like, I don't know, squeezing that much data into tiny like it's a physical space.

146
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,440
Is there any?

147
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,120
Terabyte is a terabyte.

148
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,880
Yeah, but I guess what I'm saying is, is there any physical limitation to how far this can

149
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,120
go?

150
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,040
Oh, there's been a lot of innovations in that space for better for worse, for sure.

151
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:17,280
Yeah, they do all sorts of shenanigans to fit more bits and bytes and stuff onto a single

152
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:17,760
platter.

153
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,360
You know, that's way beyond what I think about generally on on the regular.

154
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,440
I think about how much space I can fit into a single drive slot.

155
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,920
And for for me, in my backup server, for example, I've just built a new backup server that has

156
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,680
five hot swap drive bays.

157
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,720
And so for me, I want to be able to cram as many terabytes into those five slots as I

158
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,200
can.

159
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,520
So trying to get the most terabyte per slot for me is the name of the game.

160
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,560
Yep, I totally agree.

161
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,920
Totally agree.

162
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,240
So Santa brought you a few gifts and some of them speak home kit.

163
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,120
And this is a topic we've danced around on the show because we appreciate not everyone

164
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,840
listening even cares about this kind of stuff.

165
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,400
You've been prepping for this episode for years.

166
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:10,080
Yeah, you know, honestly, before I gave home assistant a go, I gave home kit a go.

167
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,160
Like, I just tried to do everything with home kit because there's there's things I like

168
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,480
about it.

169
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,120
If you're not familiar, it's it's basically a software framework that Apple created that

170
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,680
exists in the iOS ecosystem and now the Mac.

171
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,920
And it allows for land based smart automation and device controls.

172
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,000
And it's because it's land based, it's really quick.

173
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,720
And because it's Apple, it's integrated into the OS and it's integrated into any of the

174
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:42,480
Siri speaker devices and anything that you can invoke Siri on, you can control a home

175
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,200
kit device with.

176
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,080
So that it kind of opens it up to a pretty wide ecosystem.

177
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,280
Even the Apple TV remote can be used to control home kit devices.

178
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,200
And of course, Apple builds home kit automations into their shortcuts app on the iPhone.

179
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,640
So you can build automations in your smart home using the shortcuts app, just if you

180
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,200
really live in that ecosystem.

181
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,240
But obviously, because it's Apple's ecosystem, it's a big sandbox, but it is absolutely a

182
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,680
sandbox and it does have walls.

183
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,120
So absolutely, I'm already bumping up against those walls on, you know, day 10 or whatever

184
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,680
of my iOS transition.

185
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,960
You know, I've been using Android for the best part of a decade and I figured I'd give

186
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,160
the iOS side a proper college try this year.

187
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
So I'm going to keep going with this phone.

188
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,160
I'm going to try and do a year.

189
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,120
We'll see how it goes.

190
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,640
I like it so far for the most part.

191
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,680
There's a couple of things, but coming back to home kit, what's really nice is how it's

192
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
it's seamless, right?

193
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,320
And when I pull down on my notification kind of control center thing up in the top right,

194
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,880
I get a button there called home, which has some favorites within it.

195
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,480
And one of the things that came up right away without any configuration at all was my LG

196
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:54,880
TV.

197
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,200
So I can just turn it on and off straight from my phone.

198
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,560
No need for a specific app.

199
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,640
Yeah, as you would expect, Apple is pretty good at what they do support.

200
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,680
It works pretty well.

201
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,040
And home kit itself seems to be fairly robust.

202
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,360
They've open sourced a lot of it.

203
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,160
It uses encryption that seems to be pretty strong.

204
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,520
And they're promising broader integration with matter as that develops.

205
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,720
They're one of the partners there.

206
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,040
So there's some things to like about it.

207
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,240
And I think as we get into this, I want to talk about how you can integrate it with Home

208
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,560
Assistant.

209
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,920
I don't know if you've tried that yet, Alex.

210
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,600
Not yet.

211
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,240
I mean, you know that I have dozens of home automation devices around this house already.

212
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,320
The only one that got picked up out of the box was my LG TV.

213
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,800
Okay, well, so I think let's let's start here.

214
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,640
I think where I want to take this is if you have family members listening that want some

215
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,480
home automation, they're not comfortable with Google or Amazon doing cloud control services.

216
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,000
And they're not interested in running something like Home Assistant or OpenHAB or a smart

217
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,360
things hub, but they have iOS devices, right?

218
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,040
This is a category of user that's perfect for this because they can really get a lot

219
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,120
done here at the studio.

220
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,760
Here at the studio, I actually use automations with HomeKit to turn on and off the lights

221
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,200
when I arrive and leave.

222
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,080
I don't actually do it directly on Home Assistant.

223
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,560
It's triggering Home Assistant devices, which we'll talk about.

224
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,040
But the automation is actually being triggered by shortcuts on my iPhone.

225
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,840
Also, I use that same setup to scan NFC tags to trigger automations.

226
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,240
So there's some nice things you can get without having to run a whole back end infrastructure.

227
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,200
So what happens when Chris's iPhone isn't there?

228
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,840
They have this concept of a hub, and it's either the Apple TV or an iPad that you're

229
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:46,960
willing to leave on the LAN, probably plugged in, or a HomePod, big or small.

230
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,000
They can all act as a HomeKit hub.

231
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,040
It becomes the primary orchestrator of your HomeKit network.

232
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,200
And if you're comfortable with this, it also will act as the proxy to iCloud.

233
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,120
So Apple establishes a secure connection between your iPhone and iCloud.

234
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,680
So when you leave the house, you can pull down that control center, and all your devices

235
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,400
still work, all their status information still works.

236
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,720
And when you trigger them, what's happening is a proxied request is being routed through

237
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,400
iCloud to the HomeKit hub, which in my case is a HomePod.

238
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,440
And then the HomePod is executing it locally on your LAN.

239
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,760
Okay, that's pretty legit.

240
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,680
That's similar to the Nebuchadnezzar service, right?

241
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,320
Right, and it's all encrypted between your HomeKit hub and your phone.

242
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
So Apple doesn't have the key to that.

243
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,560
So they do have the ability to exchange it.

244
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,720
So in theory, they could probably intercept it.

245
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,200
But as far as where the encryption keys are held, it's on your iPhone or your iOS device,

246
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,000
could be the watch, and the HomeKit hub.

247
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,680
So how do I add things that don't have HomeKit support to this ecosystem?

248
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,240
Can I do that?

249
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,040
I do it through Home Assistant, but we'll get there.

250
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,160
I wanted to mention HomeBridge.

251
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,720
HomeBridge is really the way to do this right now.

252
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,640
You mentioned LG televisions.

253
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,440
Before LG natively supported HomeKit, everyone was doing it with HomeBridge.

254
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,840
And you could run it like on a Raspberry Pi, and it essentially, it'll talk their proprietary

255
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,760
API, whatever protocol or service it might be.

256
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,360
The bridge will talk that, and then it will translate it to HomeKit.

257
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,520
So it'll just show up to your iPhone as a HomeKit device.

258
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,160
But it's really the bridge making that representation.

259
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,040
And so people were controlling LG televisions using this bridge, and LG got wind of it.

260
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,800
They thought, oh, well, maybe we should work with Apple and just build in the HomeKit support.

261
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,320
And that's how that actually started.

262
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,760
So I don't need the HomeBridge.

263
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,600
That's just nice to have.

264
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,920
Yeah, and you really don't if you're a Home Assistant user.

265
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,280
But again, if you want to go the route of controlling stuff without the whole infrastructure

266
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,640
of managing Home Assistant, you could use HomeKit to do 90% of what you need.

267
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,720
And then those random cheap devices that are quote unquote smart devices that are not HomeKit

268
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,640
compatible, you could run HomeBridge on your Mac or on a Raspberry Pi or on a Windows box

269
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,640
or a Linux box, and you could get that other 10%.

270
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,080
And it does a bunch of neat stuff that Apple's probably never going to really do, you know,

271
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,760
as any community builds on.

272
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,600
So there's some other advantages to HomeBridge.

273
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,760
It's not necessary unless you want to support non-HomeKit compatible devices.

274
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,240
OK, well, thanks for clearing that up.

275
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,320
The terminology here is so confusing, you know, HomeKit and HomeBridge and Home Assistant.

276
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,720
And it's kind of hard to keep all this stuff straight in your head when you're fresh to it.

277
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,040
Why don't we come back to that in just a second?

278
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,920
Linode.com slash SSH.

279
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,960
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

280
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,560
And you go there to support the show.

281
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,440
That's how this works.

282
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,520
You go there, you support us, we keep on going.

283
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,920
And it's like the circle of podcasting.

284
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,520
It's an ecosystem, if you will.

285
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,280
You know, Linode is how we host everything.

286
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,920
It's also how I'll do like a quick R&D.

287
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,440
I want to try out an open source project or I have an idea for something that I want to

288
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,080
build.

289
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,960
I guess back in the day, I'd like get a VM on my local machine, but those always kind

290
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,360
of suck.

291
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,320
And not to mention it makes my machine busy and I have to have a certain machine that's

292
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,920
always capable of doing that.

293
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,240
When I flipped to using Linode for this kind of stuff, it changed like the kind of hardware

294
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,280
I'm buying now.

295
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,440
It like opened up a whole new door, man.

296
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,360
It's really it's really pretty great, even just for like just research and development.

297
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,600
And then, of course, you want to flip it to production.

298
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,760
It's the best place to do that, in my opinion.

299
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,600
They got 11 data centers around the world.

300
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,920
Their machines are screamers, just super fast.

301
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,240
Lots of distributions to choose from, including now images for Rocky Linux and Alma Linux

302
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,080
and CentOS Stream, if that's your thing.

303
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,080
And on top of all of it, a really great user experience.

304
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,760
Every system over there is a great value, great performance, and a nice experience setting

305
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,240
it up.

306
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,760
If you like to do it yourself and build it from the ground up or just deploy an image

307
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,320
with something ready to go, like say Next Cloud, maybe Discourse or GitLab, they've

308
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,240
got one click deployments for that.

309
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,840
And then I'm often finding that I'm taking advantage of their things like S3 compatible

310
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,560
object storage just by using their command line client or just not even having a machine

311
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,800
in between or just using a web interface.

312
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,720
They have all kinds of nice things like that, like a DNS manager that's going to let you

313
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,920
get done what you need.

314
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,840
Kubernetes support, if that's the way you go, just a lot to try.

315
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,840
And pricing is 30% to 50% cheaper than any other major cloud provider.

316
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,240
So go to linode.com slash SSH.

317
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,720
Get that $100 to really try it out.

318
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,320
Kick the tires, create an account, see what I'm talking about, and support the show.

319
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,560
linode.com slash SSH.

320
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Alex was touching on a bunch of the terminology here, but Chris, it sounds like you've put

321
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,760
a bunch of links in the show notes.

322
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,960
Link Ninja, and I didn't overdo it.

323
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,080
I just tried to put the best of the best in there that helps you go through it all with

324
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,920
screenshots and stuff like that.

325
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,520
So if you're trying to set this up for yourself or like a family member, hopefully those will

326
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,400
work as a resource.

327
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,680
But Alex, I think what you really need to kind of wrap your head around is connecting

328
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,680
HomeKit and Home Assistant.

329
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,840
You've got such an established Home Assistant set up now that I don't really think it's

330
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:11,840
worth like developing and I guess cultivating your HomeKit devices because you're essentially

331
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,120
going to replace them with everything that's in Home Assistant when you connect it.

332
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:21,760
And so every device that is in Home Assistant will now show up to your iPhone as a HomeKit

333
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,240
device.

334
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,760
So you connect the devices to Home Assistant and then they show up on the iPhone.

335
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,080
And so that means non-HomeKit devices show up, obviously.

336
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,520
That also means things like your automations and your scripts and those types of things,

337
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,800
even camera feeds now also show up as HomeKit devices.

338
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,240
Camera feeds?

339
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,440
Yeah, it depends on the camera, of course, but yeah.

340
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,120
Oh, that's pretty cool.

341
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,720
So I've just right now installed the HomeKit integration and I now have about 20 different

342
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,840
devices asking me to scan a QR code and add them to the Home app.

343
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,920
Yeah, that's why I'm saying like it's kind of easier to just I had to just take a weekend

344
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,160
and because I was all in on HomeKit and I just had to move them all over if I recall,

345
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,600
although read on it because it's been so long since I've done it that they may have changed

346
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,480
the way it works now.

347
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,480
But then future devices now I just add them directly to Home Assistant.

348
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,160
All right.

349
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,800
So live listeners, I am going through the process of adding a camera into the Home app.

350
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,200
I have added the HomeKit integration.

351
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,200
Now I'm going through my notifications and adding by scanning a QR code in the Home app

352
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,640
on iOS, I'm adding an uncertified accessory and I get a great big warning telling me it's

353
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,040
not secure as I do it.

354
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,600
It's now connecting to the camera, which is in the kitchen.

355
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,920
What's that kitchen hub?

356
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,360
I don't even have a camera in the kitchen.

357
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
Oh, yeah, it'll try to guess.

358
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,320
Yeah, it will try to continue.

359
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,640
OK, blue iris, all cameras and camera that you know of.

360
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,360
I mean, let's be honest, Brett and I have both been in there.

361
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,280
There's a few cameras you don't know about.

362
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,200
Oh, it's my driveway, not my kitchen.

363
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,880
That's pretty cool.

364
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,560
Yeah.

365
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,840
Now what's nice is all your devices on your iCloud account and your family devices can

366
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,880
get access to those.

367
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,640
So Catherine could have all of those devices on her iPhone and my kids, like when they're

368
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,600
at the RV, have access to those devices on their iPad so they can read or be in bed at

369
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,640
night and they can just grab their iPad and turn the lighting off when they're done now,

370
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,600
which has been great because they just discovered that on their own.

371
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,520
And I didn't even have to tell them about it.

372
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,440
And they have also the tablets, but now they have it right there on the device that they

373
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,000
already have.

374
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,760
So why not have that additional integration?

375
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,200
Absolutely.

376
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,400
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

377
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,120
For me, answers some of the biggest questions I had actually, and I've deliberately left

378
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,840
all of this research to do it kind of live on air, live on the episode to make it more

379
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,800
exciting or something.

380
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,360
I don't know.

381
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,800
It answers some questions that I had about how to actually integrate this stuff.

382
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,680
But when we were talking the other day, you suggested that I might need an Apple TV.

383
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,680
And I know we touched on the iPad and things like that as like a home hub.

384
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,520
Why would I need that?

385
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,960
Is that for the kind of relay thing that you were mentioning?

386
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,480
Yeah, so the Apple TV can act as that hub.

387
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,000
And it will do a fine job because it's powered on all the time.

388
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,840
And you'll probably have it plugged into Ethernet.

389
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,920
So it's actually a really good device for that.

390
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,680
And they have a low power mode for it and everything like that.

391
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,000
And there's even some information when you go into the settings screen.

392
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,160
You can see like what its status is as far as your home GitHub goes.

393
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,720
And when you put it on your network, you plug it in.

394
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,560
If that's the first device you have, that's if you don't like, say, or you have a home

395
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,800
pod, it'll just sort of negotiate and it'll become the leader automatically.

396
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,720
You'll never know. You never really have to fuss.

397
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,440
It just does it.

398
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,800
Now, I've just tried to add my robot vacuum and it tried to pick that up as a camera for

399
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,360
some reason.

400
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:58,960
I think because of the map portion that the Xiaomi RoboVac thing that I have, Roborock

401
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,400
S5 is the one I have, and it's trying to use that map as a camera and it's just failing

402
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,120
and spinning.

403
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,800
And so this isn't perfect by any stretch, but I can certainly see why this would be

404
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,300
useful.

405
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,140
What I would do for some of those devices is just disable them in HomeKit because like

406
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,420
so say you have like my sensors that have six different sensor feeds.

407
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,420
Each one of those will show up as a device in HomeKit.

408
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,980
The humidity, like all of it just shows up as a device.

409
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,540
And some of it there isn't like a parallel.

410
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,900
There's nothing in the Apple world that equates to that kind of device.

411
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,740
And so I just disable those.

412
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,860
So basically, it's like a one time curation where I go through and I just I take a look

413
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,940
through and I just I take some stuff out.

414
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,700
There's a couple of different ways you can do that.

415
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,220
I don't remember the best way, but I found it online by looking and I just went through

416
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,700
one time and disabled everything that I didn't want in that HomeKit screen once.

417
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,660
And it's been great.

418
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,940
But yeah, there is edge cases like a device that has two camera feeds and stuff like that.

419
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,420
But I think Apple only expects devices to have one single camera and those kinds of

420
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,300
weird edge cases.

421
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,900
But when you're looking for like controlling smart devices or lights or kicking off automations

422
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,980
or scripts, it's great at that kind of stuff.

423
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:17,780
But it doesn't fully replace going to the Home Assistant web UI or app if you're even

424
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,900
a moderate power user.

425
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,900
I don't think it helps either.

426
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:26,580
My other primary HomeKit kind of ecosystem, the Philips Hue stuff, I recently replaced

427
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,900
that with a Combi to ZigBee bridge and ZigBee buttons everywhere.

428
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:37,460
So the couple of low hanging fruit that I had that would have worked now don't work

429
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,700
because I've kind of taken that control back in house.

430
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:45,140
But if you do connect HomeKit up all to Home Assistant, then those will show up.

431
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,980
Those will be devices as buttons you can use in HomeKit.

432
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,700
That's pretty cool.

433
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:50,900
Yeah.

434
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:56,340
And so then that means also your iPad gets that, your watch and any of your Siri tubes

435
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:56,820
get that.

436
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:02,260
And I think the Siri tubes actually make for kind of a nice home automation voice control.

437
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,700
It's a decent compromise.

438
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:09,780
I think it's not a perfect privacy story, but it's clearly better than Google and better

439
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:10,900
than Amazon.

440
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:16,180
Yeah, I'd be lying if I said that wasn't part of my motivation to switch for a bit.

441
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:21,140
And I like that their protocol is LAN based.

442
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,740
It's not API cloud based.

443
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,540
It's LAN based.

444
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:29,700
Now, the voice translation that Siri does is cloud based, although Apple does seem to

445
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,580
be moving to doing that on chip more and more.

446
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,860
They do that in the latest iPhone.

447
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,420
So it's conceivable future HomePods may do local transcription.

448
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,260
So that part still goes to the cloud.

449
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:45,060
But once Siri realizes what you're asking for, that happens on the LAN.

450
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,500
That happens immediately.

451
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,580
It's faster than some of the other ones because of that.

452
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:54,180
So another question I have for you, with the Nebuchadnezzar cloud service, I can connect

453
00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:03,220
the Google and Amazon PUCs, tubes, whatever, voice assistants to react to various phrases.

454
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,700
And I can program those with Google, for example.

455
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,900
You do it in the Google Home app.

456
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:12,180
I can create key phrases that trigger certain scripts in Home Assistant, that kind of thing.

457
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,700
What's the equivalent in the HomeKit world?

458
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,620
That's a great question.

459
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,260
I'm really glad you asked because I should make this point.

460
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:26,180
You don't need Nebuchadnezzar cloud or any of that to have HomeKit and Siri work together

461
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:32,180
and have Siri trigger all the HomeKit stuff because it's doing it through the HomeKit

462
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:32,820
integration.

463
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:41,940
And Siri is executing those commands from the hub device or whatever Siri device requests

464
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,060
it directly to the Home Assistant using that integration.

465
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:50,660
So it bypasses the need for the complicated setup to get Google Assistant to work completely.

466
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:54,180
So also, I think it's just a great setup because you don't actually need the Nebuchadnezzar

467
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:54,740
cloud part.

468
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,460
You don't have to do all the cloud stuff if you don't want to.

469
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,740
So you just get the HomeKit integration set up.

470
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:06,340
And once you have all the HomeKit devices associated with Home Assistant, Siri just

471
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,140
works.

472
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,860
It'll work on your phone.

473
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,900
It'll work on your HomePod.

474
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,700
It'll work on your watch.

475
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,140
It'll work on your Apple TV.

476
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,900
It all just happens immediately.

477
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,700
Very nice.

478
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,420
Now, we're going to take a quick break from the Apple stuff.

479
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,620
We'll come back to that shortly.

480
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,140
I have a request to ask of our listenership.

481
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,380
My mother sent me a few videotapes for Christmas.

482
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,740
They are mini DV format tapes.

483
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:35,700
I rang a local video shop that does like digital or analog to digital conversions and they

484
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,940
wanted to charge me something like $20 a tape and I've got about 10 or 20 of these things

485
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,580
to digitize.

486
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,900
That seems a little bit expensive to me.

487
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,580
Also, what seems expensive is looking on eBay at these used camcorders.

488
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:55,700
They're like $100, $150 for a 10, 15 year old outdated proprietary format camcorder.

489
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:01,860
So I was wondering if there's anybody in the audience that has any suggestions about how

490
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:09,380
I could acquire a mini DV camcorder for cheaper than $150 or would be willing to pay for it.

491
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,260
Or would be willing to loan me one for a few weeks.

492
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,140
That would be kind of cool.

493
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:19,300
If you have any suggestions about how to actually go ahead and digitize the tapes properly,

494
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:22,900
please let us know at selfhosted at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

495
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,300
Tailscale.com slash self-hosted.

496
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,700
Go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices and you support the show.

497
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,820
Yeah, it's Tailscale.

498
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,580
It's a zero config VPN.

499
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,580
It installs on any device in minutes.

500
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,500
It manages your firewall rules for you and it works from anywhere.

501
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,780
Devices connect directly to each other using WireGuard's noise protocol encryption.

502
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:49,620
It builds a mesh network with the best VPN security in the business.

503
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,940
And it does it quickly and easily.

504
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,900
You'll create a secure network between your servers or your computers or your cloud devices.

505
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,900
And even when you're separated by firewall, subnets or the dreaded double NAT,

506
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,660
Tailscale just works.

507
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,940
I use Tailscale to keep all of my family's computers connected.

508
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,460
I provide them tech support.

509
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,260
I give them access to the secure resources behind my firewall.

510
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,780
And I have it running on everything from an arch 86 server to a Raspberry Pi with

511
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,820
openSUSE Tumbleweed and my iOS devices.

512
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:22,900
But for me, some of the best parts is just that every device on my network now has a stable IP.

513
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,740
No matter where I'm at, what Wi-Fi network I'm on or if I'm on cellular, it's always the same IP.

514
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,300
So my bookmarks that I've set for all my different dashboards and everything work every time.

515
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,700
And devices only connect after they sign through your existing identity provider.

516
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,420
So you could easily enforce multi-factor authentication

517
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,660
and you can deauthorize the machines you need to.

518
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,500
Maybe an employee has moved on or so forth.

519
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:51,460
And the fact that my Tailscale VPNs are always on and work with every OS that I use and has

520
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,020
a GUI based ACL editor, well, that's just like icing on the cake.

521
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,420
It's dead simple to use and it's fast.

522
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,620
That's the main reason I liked it.

523
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,580
And I ended up using it every single day.

524
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,500
So go try it for yourself for free.

525
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:10,100
Up to 20 machines and support the show at tailscale.com slash self-hosted.

526
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,380
That's tailscale.com slash self-hosted, one word.

527
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,460
Hey, Chris, I've got good news.

528
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:23,300
The NVIDIA Shield, our favorite video player has been updated to Android TV 11.

529
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,820
It has a stadia button now.

530
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,380
Wait, are you serious?

531
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,180
No, I mean, it's apparently called it 95 Google.

532
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,420
Yeah.

533
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,940
Oh, boy.

534
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,260
And they didn't get rid of the ads either.

535
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,540
I went and looked for a screenshot.

536
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,900
Still has the ads on the interface.

537
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,740
That kind of home launcher thing is all money, baby.

538
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,100
You know, I don't know what is going on, but I was trying to watch Deadwood and I have

539
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:51,700
the NVIDIA Shield in the bedroom and I don't watch TV back there a lot, but I was just for

540
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:56,100
whatever reason, we were watching TV back there that night and I hit play and I start

541
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,540
watching it and about five minutes in, it starts buffering.

542
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,540
I'm thinking, what the hell's going on here?

543
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:08,260
So I pull up the Raspberry Pi on, you know, SSH on my phone in my bed, like a lazy bastard,

544
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:12,660
and I pull up H-Top and sure enough, Plex is chugging away transcoding.

545
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:19,940
And so I go get the information in the playback and it says that the audio codec is unsupported.

546
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,900
And so it's transcoding the entire thing, even the video, because the audio codec, whatever

547
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,700
it is, I don't know, is unsupported on the Shield, but shockingly, it doesn't have to

548
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,100
transcode it for playback on the Apple TV.

549
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:37,060
So I can't imagine what codec the Apple TV has that the NVIDIA Shield doesn't, but I

550
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:41,140
kind of designed my Plex setup to never transcode because I'm doing it on a Pi that's doing

551
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,340
like a thousand other things.

552
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:47,460
So once it starts transcoding, all bets are off, you know, that TV watching session gets

553
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:47,960
wrecked.

554
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,620
I think the NVIDIA Shield, we did an episode on it a long time ago, but it is the single

555
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:58,340
longest running piece of hardware in my entire house, near enough.

556
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:04,340
I think I've got a UniFi access point and an NVIDIA Shield that all date from 2014,

557
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,100
15, something like that, and I haven't replaced or upgraded either of them.

558
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,620
It's like the Android LTS, right?

559
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,180
I think it helps that it's the same chip that they used in the Nintendo Switch, though.

560
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,420
Yeah, and a couple of NVIDIA devices they sold to OEMs too, so I'm sure they still have

561
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,540
engineers working on drivers and getting Linux running on there.

562
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:32,980
So I'm keeping mine for now, but I am tempted to replace it because of this codec issue,

563
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,980
although it really hasn't been a problem in the past.

564
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,820
So what would you replace it with, Mr. Apple iOS boy?

565
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,340
Well, what do you think?

566
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,860
I actually think the Apple TV is pretty decent, especially if you only buy these things every

567
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:48,820
four or five years, and they don't update it very often, so they last about five years.

568
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,940
The performance is better than even the NVIDIA Shield, and that really is saying something.

569
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,980
This isn't supposed to be an exhaustive comparison between the Apple TV and the NVIDIA Shield.

570
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,220
Perhaps we'll save that for a future episode.

571
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,180
But there's a couple of things before I buy one that make me worry a little bit about

572
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,420
doing so, potentially.

573
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,020
Number one is I'll list my use cases and then perhaps you can address them.

574
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,020
Are you talking about the Apple TV or the Shield?

575
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,220
So I'm talking about use cases I have on the Shield that I'm worried I won't be able to

576
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,300
replicate on the Apple TV.

577
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:19,860
Gotcha.

578
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,900
First of all is iPlayer.

579
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:29,460
So obviously living in the States and being British, we like to get real TV from the BBC.

580
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:34,340
And the way we do that is we have a WireGuard VPN that goes into one of my parents' houses

581
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:41,140
in England, and our IP address is a residential IP, so so far as the BBC are concerned, we

582
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:45,220
can just stream iPlayer as if we were in that building, and there's no problems there.

583
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,380
Whereas if you were trying to use several commercial VPNs or host something up on Linode

584
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:55,220
or DigitalOcean or AN other cloud provider, that IP block is kind of blacklisted by the

585
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,780
BBC.

586
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:02,660
We've also heard stories that they blacklist certain models of Rokus from listeners, so

587
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,820
you know you've got to be really careful about the devices you try and do this on apparently.

588
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,460
So that's number one is how am I going to get a WireGuard tunnel on an Apple TV back

589
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,500
to England?

590
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,620
And then the second one is something like Kodi.

591
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:21,140
So Kodi, as I'm sure most of our listeners know, is like the jack-of-all-trades, like

592
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:25,780
if it won't play in Kodi, it's a broken file type video player.

593
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:32,820
So for me, those two things, Plex and Jellyfin, I'm assuming, are both absolutely fine on

594
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,460
the Apple TV?

595
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,020
Yeah, those are fine.

596
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,580
Those are both really good questions.

597
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:43,940
I don't really have an answer for you on the WireGuard VPN other than solving that at the

598
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:49,300
network layer, which I could imagine a couple of tricky ways to do that, but no particularly

599
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,820
great ways to do that.

600
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:57,140
But I could imagine a routing situation where you're taking care of that at your firewall

601
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,900
or at some other device.

602
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,460
That's the only way I could think of it.

603
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:07,140
I think you'd probably want to go that route because it's not on the Apple TV.

604
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:12,740
It's not unheard of to have people route the Apple TV and install third-party apps.

605
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:20,260
That's been more common on the Apple TV than it is on other iOS devices, but I don't really

606
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,260
find that to be a good long-term way to go because eventually Apple releases an OS that

607
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,540
breaks it every time.

608
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:30,660
You used to be able to, to your second question, there was a period of time where you could

609
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,220
make an Apple TV a hell of a Kodi box.

610
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,100
It was awesome.

611
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,260
But time moved on, Apple updated the hardware and the OS requirements and that ability went

612
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:38,760
away.

613
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,620
And I have replaced Kodi with Infuse.

614
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,380
I've mentioned it before on the show.

615
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:52,820
I think Infuse is the best set top television style interface to video playback.

616
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,580
It's got the best codec support.

617
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,260
It supports Samba shares.

618
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,860
It supports SFTP.

619
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,420
It supports syncing to Plex and Jellyfin.

620
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,940
It supports DLNA.

621
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,300
It supports just attaching a disk and watching files locally.

622
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,580
It's got tons of codecs.

623
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,740
It has a super active development team.

624
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:13,780
And all respect to the Plex team, they're just focused on making a great video player.

625
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,140
They don't necessarily need to own the back end.

626
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,660
If you want to roll it with a file system, they'll go that way.

627
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,220
If you want to sync it to a Plex server or Jellyfin, they'll go that way.

628
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:28,820
And so Infuse for me, I even subscribed to the Pro version because I think it's absolutely

629
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,380
worth it.

630
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:32,980
And I took about a year off from Kodi.

631
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,100
And man, I tell you what, I used to be one of Kodi's biggest fans.

632
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:41,860
You can find really embarrassing old videos of me on YouTube where I'm really advocating

633
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,580
Kodi.

634
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:47,540
Actually, man, you can even find videos of me advocating XBMC before it became Kodi.

635
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,580
Like, it's the loyalty runs deep.

636
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:56,980
I think there are videos of you advocating how to run XBMC on a PlayStation 3 running

637
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,540
Linux.

638
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:02,820
Back in the day, do you remember DLP televisions, the ones with the reverse projectors?

639
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,460
Yeah, it was 720p, baby.

640
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,260
And we were happy.

641
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,300
God damn it.

642
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,260
Yeah, it was.

643
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,460
It was great.

644
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,300
But I took a year off from Kodi and then I went back to it last month.

645
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,660
And oh, my God, I realized it's just from another era.

646
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,020
Like, I think if you have momentum with it, it's fantastic.

647
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:30,100
But if you take a year off and then come back to it, we don't design software this way anymore.

648
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:35,540
And it does all this crazy stuff and it's a lot.

649
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:40,180
And Infuse, it seems simple at first, it's deceptively simple.

650
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:44,260
But as you begin to use it, you realize it's very powerful.

651
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,900
And it has a fantastic video playback engine too, which is job one here.

652
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:54,020
And it's great at jumping around, the just only downside, but if you're a Jellyfin user,

653
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,580
you're used to this.

654
00:35:54,580 --> 00:36:00,260
But if you're a Plex user, I think the only downside is that it doesn't have skip intro,

655
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:04,020
which I love, but they do not yet support skip intro.

656
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,460
I think it's on the roadmap.

657
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:10,980
It does have a feature that Plex needs to have, and that is it blurs spoilers.

658
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:16,340
So when you go into a show and you look at a season, it blurs the episodes you haven't

659
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,540
watched yet, and I can't tell you how great that is.

660
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,380
Whilst you were talking just then, I've actually gone ahead and installed it on the Mac.

661
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:28,820
I'm recording this on and connected up my Plex library within, what, two minutes?

662
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,220
Yeah, pretty, pretty impressive.

663
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,380
It's doing something now where it's processing my files or something like that.

664
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:42,100
But I've got a 4K HEVC 10-bit test file that I know is of a very, very high codec, and

665
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,260
it just played instantly on my Mac.

666
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:48,980
So if you turn on the iCloud sync settings, you can then go install it on your Apple TV,

667
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,980
and all of those directories and stuff will be there on the Apple TV immediately.

668
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,460
It may have to do some scanning, but it's nice like that.

669
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:02,260
And the thing about the Apple TV is the Apple processors have been really good CPUs for,

670
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,780
what, five years now?

671
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,700
And so even though it doesn't have the latest processor, it's still just about better than

672
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,540
anything else that's shipping in any other set-top box, and that includes power use.

673
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,860
It's a low-power device, too, so it takes less power when I'm running on solar than

674
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,700
the Shield does, which, you know, not a big difference with these devices, but I'll take

675
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,300
every little gain I can get.

676
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,580
Marginal gains, Chris?

677
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,180
Marginal gains?

678
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,220
Marginal gains matter in the solar business.

679
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,220
Yeah, they do.

680
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:33,460
Well, whilst we're on the topic of media servers, I know we talked about Jellyfin a couple of

681
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,140
episodes ago, mentioned it on LUP as well, I think.

682
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:41,860
And Bryn, I know you've been building a Jellyfin box for your family.

683
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,380
How's that been going?

684
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,620
Yeah, I finally dove in.

685
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:51,620
I think I ran out of excuses to try Docker, try my hand at Docker, and Jellyfin was a

686
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:54,740
nice excuse to do that.

687
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:58,900
I have to say, I think it's the beginning of a new era for me, which is very exciting.

688
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:04,020
I mean, you guys are old-hand at this, but Jellyfin itself, I think I've been really

689
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,500
impressed.

690
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,620
It's the first time I really tried to run a centralized media solution.

691
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:17,380
And in my situation, my brother's in one home and about 90 steps away, I'm in another cabin

692
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,820
and we kind of watch movies back and forth a lot.

693
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,060
But we share network, which is kind of neat.

694
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,900
So I'm able to kind of optimize this thing while they're sitting there watching TV, which

695
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,900
is kind of fun.

696
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,860
But it just opened up a whole new world of possibility for me.

697
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:36,660
I have always wanted to be able to, I don't know, sit at the dining room table and be

698
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:41,780
able to put on my favorite album or change to, oh, I feel like jazz now.

699
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:48,020
And I can see Jellyfin being able to do that because you can sort of tell it to play the

700
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,460
music on a different device.

701
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:55,620
And these are maybe features that I should have had in my life a long time ago.

702
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,740
Perhaps you two are just laughing at me because I'm late to the game here.

703
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,980
But it sounds and feels really transformative, really.

704
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:08,020
Well, I'll tell you, I'm curious because I know that we've shared Plex servers with

705
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,780
you for some time now.

706
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:13,940
So you're pretty well familiar with Plex and how it feels and how it operates in its feature

707
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,460
sets.

708
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:21,300
How does it feel as a longtime user of Plex switching over to Jellyfin?

709
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:26,260
Yeah, I think I'm looking at it from a bit of a different perspective now because I'm

710
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,900
looking at it from a bit of a different perspective now because now I'm kind of administering

711
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,300
Jellyfin, which I've never done with Plex.

712
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:41,860
But as a pure user, and I will say I have much more experience with Plex in that regard,

713
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,420
it doesn't seem quite as polished.

714
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,420
But I could see that it's starting to get there, like occasionally, I mean, I'm now

715
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:54,740
using the Jellyfin app on my Android phone to browse the interface and then sort of send

716
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,500
that to the TV, right?

717
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,800
So I'm doing things I never did with Plex.

718
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:06,580
But occasionally, that connection just kind of drops down, like the TV portion of it will

719
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,700
just kind of give a black screen and the interface just goes away.

720
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:14,660
So I can definitely see some glitches that I've pretty much never experienced with Plex,

721
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:15,660
I'll say.

722
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,140
Well, inevitably, this is what usually leads someone to just get a set top box that connects

723
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:24,020
to their TV and you just have a Plex client or a Jellyfin client on that device.

724
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:30,700
And that's why Alex and I think about this a lot because you just want that to be a really

725
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,700
nice experience.

726
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:37,020
When you're sitting down, like we were sitting down to watch a movie, and we were all hyped.

727
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,700
It'd been a couple of nights we've been talking about it.

728
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:46,140
We finally sat down to watch the movie, I hit play, and I had a file error.

729
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,620
And I was able to resolve it quickly.

730
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:50,820
I figured out what was wrong pretty quick, probably took us about five minutes.

731
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:55,780
But that is it's so like disruptive because you got you got a whole night going.

732
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,500
It kills the momentum of the entire night for a good five minutes.

733
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,740
And that's a best case scenario.

734
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:06,580
You know, that's a best case scenario, five minutes, I think it's by far the time of day

735
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,180
you want to least be doing this kind of troubleshooting, right?

736
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,460
That's how I ultimately ended up going with just Apple TV and infuse.

737
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,620
But I like that you're going down this route.

738
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,820
I'm actually kind of more excited that you're playing with Docker.

739
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,580
I think that's going to be really great, too, because that's going to open you up to a world

740
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,260
of trying all kinds of apps.

741
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,140
And those skills will work on any Linux box.

742
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:32,780
If it's a, you know, laptop, a server, or, you know, a VPS machine, it's the same commands

743
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,260
and tools to install software on all of them.

744
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,980
That sounds really nice.

745
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,960
And I think it's also going to be a huge paradigm shift.

746
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,580
You've both talked about how the day you kind of wrapped your head around Docker, your whole

747
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,180
idea of how to run computers changed.

748
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,300
And I'm really just starting that journey.

749
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:56,140
For me, it was, as an old IT guy that was doing this for, you know, for years before

750
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,900
we even had anything like containers, I mean, FreeBSD had jails.

751
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:05,740
But for me, it was finally a real solution to separate my application from my data.

752
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:09,580
That had always been something that I thought the lines blurred too much when I would set

753
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,100
up a home server.

754
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:16,540
And with containers, and Docker, I think, is the most widely used container technology.

755
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:23,180
With containers, I finally had a really solid, reproducible way where I could blow away the

756
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,180
application.

757
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:29,040
I could completely destroy the container, pull down a fresh one.

758
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,420
If the config was all the same in my Docker Compose, it just reconnects everything.

759
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,220
It starts right back up.

760
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:39,460
And that was the day I was like, oh, man, this means I can finally move an application

761
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:40,700
and its data around.

762
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:47,140
I can pick all the data up off of one server, drop it on a new server, take that Docker

763
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:51,500
Compose file, pull down the image, and it reconnects like it's always been running on

764
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,500
that box.

765
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,500
It just fires right up.

766
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,740
And it makes disaster recovery such a thing of beauty.

767
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,380
And it makes actually being able to move off of a box so much easier.

768
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,020
So when you need to grow and expand down the road, it's so much simpler.

769
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:09,980
You know, I was giving this also as a gift to my brother's wife because she loves watching

770
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,980
videos and stuff.

771
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,020
And we don't have the greatest internet connection, as you know.

772
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,780
And so I've been ripping all of her favorite DVDs.

773
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,480
She has just boxes of them.

774
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,420
And so this was a nice gift to give.

775
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,660
But the morning, Christmas morning, I thought, OK, I had stayed up late, you know, putting

776
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,500
a bunch of stuff on there, make sure everything works.

777
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:32,620
And that morning, for whatever reason, the interface on Jellyfin just stopped working.

778
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,420
I couldn't access it.

779
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,420
I couldn't do anything.

780
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,180
And I thought, oh, this is hard sinking.

781
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,020
And I think Christmas morning is maybe not the time to be troubleshooting.

782
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,060
But what I ended up doing was just, OK, I'm going to start from scratch.

783
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:48,820
It wasn't that hard to kind of build this thing.

784
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:53,160
So I'm just going to delete the container and start over again.

785
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:59,380
And I had that aha moment that you just described, which was brought the container up.

786
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:03,660
And then everything was identical to the way I had left it, except it was now working.

787
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,560
And that was the lightbulb moment where I was like, oh, not only have I rescued my Christmas

788
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,520
gift, but this is amazing.

789
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:18,320
And it just then made me realize, OK, I've got to do this everywhere.

790
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,180
There's no way that I don't want to be playing much, much more with this.

791
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:25,980
I do have a few questions for each of you, though.

792
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:33,300
I was constantly wanting to use the tools that I've had for many years to try to interact

793
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,400
somehow with, like for troubleshooting, I was like, OK, this thing's not working anymore.

794
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,700
How do I troubleshoot this thing?

795
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:43,900
And I know it's a whole world, but any like beginner tips on how to interact with these

796
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:48,460
containers and how to make them easy, I guess?

797
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,460
Right.

798
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:54,900
I have a web page over at PerfectMediaServer.com, of course, which I'll put a link to in the

799
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:01,100
show notes, which will hopefully take you through all of the basics of my ethos on why

800
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,900
you should be thinking about using containers.

801
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,140
Largely it's a regurgitation of what Brent just said.

802
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:11,100
But then throughout the rest of the page, it talks about things like Docker Compose,

803
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,020
where you get your containers from and why and how do you pick one over another and what

804
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,020
about Podman and all those kinds of things.

805
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:22,820
So if you have a bunch of questions, I would direct you to that page.

806
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,980
I will just say quickly, just to help you get your head around it, like you got to realize

807
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,740
that it's own contained environment.

808
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:32,860
So if you want to execute a command in there or something like that, you have to use the

809
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:37,300
Docker command line tools to execute the command inside that container.

810
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,500
The other thing that's kind of nice about Docker Compose, well, there's a lot of ways

811
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:45,940
to do this, but I think Docker Compose is probably the best way for a new beginner,

812
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:50,340
is when you launch an app with Docker Compose, you can do Docker Compose up.

813
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,880
And if you don't tell it to otherwise, it'll give you the output on the screen.

814
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,580
And you can sit there and watch the log output.

815
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,140
Oh, that actually sounds really interesting.

816
00:45:57,140 --> 00:45:58,140
Yeah, it's logs.

817
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,340
Really, the key to your answer is you want logs.

818
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,620
So however you have it, whatever tool you're using, you just want to be able to get to

819
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,620
the logs.

820
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,620
That's really what I wanted.

821
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:06,860
And I had no idea how to get to it.

822
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,620
So I just kind of nuked the whole thing.

823
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:12,580
And yet, that gave me exactly what I was looking for.

824
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,260
So I don't think that'll be the case every time.

825
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,620
But in this case, it worked nicely.

826
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:22,180
There is an alias that I use, which I created a long, long time ago called detail, literally

827
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:26,100
detail slammed together as one word.

828
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:31,180
And for me, what that does is it prints out the last 50 lines, it tails the last 50 lines

829
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,380
of a container's standard output.

830
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,460
So that's nice.

831
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:39,740
One thing you'll run into with containers is that not every app logs the standard out

832
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:40,740
by default.

833
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:45,540
And so sometimes, you'll look at the logs for that container, and you won't see anything

834
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,820
in the logs.

835
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:51,180
So you might need to fill that particular application, enable things like debug or error

836
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:56,260
logging or higher modes, sorry, than error logging, you know, more than warning or info

837
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:57,260
at those kinds of things.

838
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:01,740
You need to turn it up to the highest chattiness that it has in the logs.

839
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,860
Some containers that will drive your potty, other containers, it's the bare minimum.

840
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:13,140
Traffic's a good example of where they don't put enough stuff in the logs that they should.

841
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,860
We've mentioned it on the show before, but as a tool called Dozzle, which will put your

842
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:22,020
containers logs into a browser, and then you can search through the containers running

843
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:26,420
on a specific box and look at the logs in a browser, if you want to do it that way as

844
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,420
well.

845
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:31,820
Well, before we go, I should mention we're doing a meetup at the end of January here

846
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,820
at the studio.

847
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:36,780
January 30th, it's a Sunday, we'll do a live recording of Linux Unplugged.

848
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,540
And then it's a Hangin' Chow.

849
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:42,620
I have a birthday around there, so it's kind of a half birthday celebration, but I'm not

850
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:46,900
making a big deal about that, because I don't want people to think it's a birthday thing.

851
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,460
I did buy some bubbly for you that I hid in the fridge, so there'll have to be a birthday

852
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,100
pop of the cork on that one.

853
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,100

That's alright, I understand.

866
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,620

867
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,620
It's really our fault.

868

I do.

869
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:49,020
You know, you're up in the frozen tundra, up in the north, it's vaguely warm down here

870
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,020
at the moment.

871
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:55,580
Yeah, it's rough here in Seattle, we're known for our rough winters, that's for sure.
