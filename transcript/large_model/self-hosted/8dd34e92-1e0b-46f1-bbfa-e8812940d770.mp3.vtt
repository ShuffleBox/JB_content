WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
So it's a small house after all because Alex and family are back from London. How are you doing Alex?

00:05.600 --> 00:07.600
Well Chris, I'm tired

00:09.760 --> 00:11.280
I bet

00:11.280 --> 00:15.120
It's a different side of the world Alex. Yeah, I don't know like this week

00:15.280 --> 00:20.160
I just haven't been able to get back back into the groove like I went back to work on Monday like a normal person and

00:20.960 --> 00:23.840
somehow, it's Wednesday night and I'm still tired like

00:24.640 --> 00:27.200
Typically I find jet lag about an hour a day

00:27.200 --> 00:31.600
And you're about right and it's you know, we flew back on Saturday. I should be I should be good about now

00:32.000 --> 00:35.360
I'm recalling that the night you arrived you said oh going east is easy

00:36.080 --> 00:38.080
West I guess I screwed that up

00:39.600 --> 00:43.920
I think the trouble with going east is from America at least all the flights across the Atlantic

00:44.640 --> 00:46.800
Pretty much are red eye flights

00:46.880 --> 00:49.280
And so you lose not only the night of good sleep

00:49.360 --> 00:54.000
But then you also get to your destination at 7 a.m. And then you have to stay awake

00:54.000 --> 00:59.360
All day on top of no sleep. Yeah, man. So we're all friends here

00:59.440 --> 01:04.720
Is it easier harder having Brent there when you get back? Hey now. Oh, it's lovely because

01:05.280 --> 01:07.280
Yeah, the fridge is stocked and you know

01:07.840 --> 01:10.720
Loads of little things like the house feels like it's been lived in

01:11.280 --> 01:12.960
The dog's happy, you know

01:12.960 --> 01:17.920
Whenever you go away like there's inevitably something you forget like you forget to take out the rubbish or something and you come back

01:17.920 --> 01:19.600
And it's a stinky bin

01:19.600 --> 01:22.880
Nothing like that. It's all good. Yeah, that is nice

01:22.880 --> 01:26.880
That is nice. It's handy having a Brent around right? Yeah, and I think Archie had a good time, too

01:27.040 --> 01:30.000
Oh, he had a great time. Yeah, he he took care of me more than I took care of him

01:30.080 --> 01:35.520
I think I got lots of good videos. Ah, I know you came in handy when those thunderstorms swirled around so

01:35.760 --> 01:36.480
Oh, yeah

01:36.480 --> 01:43.620
Hey now did the pair of you see that the excel the world excel championships are currently live on espn2

01:44.160 --> 01:51.200
Right now is this excel like spreadsheets or is this excel like oh, yes, my goodness link in the chat link in discord

01:51.200 --> 01:53.600
No, no, no, no, no, really. What do they do?

01:55.100 --> 02:01.120
You're not kidding competitive excel formula writing I am not joking. This is a real sport. Oh my goodness

02:03.600 --> 02:05.040
This is so good

02:05.040 --> 02:08.560
Oh, this is so good. No python allowed. Is that it?

02:08.800 --> 02:14.240
Well this tournament for a one-of-a-kind sport pits the best against the best

02:14.720 --> 02:18.720
As eight experts try to solve original tasks about lottery answers

02:18.720 --> 02:23.680
And the goal is to answer as many questions as possible in a limited amount of time

02:23.760 --> 02:29.680
We should do this but like with linux and free software projects and like open source projects and self-hosting trivia

02:29.760 --> 02:32.000
Now you're talking we could do this. This could be fun

02:32.000 --> 02:37.520
We should definitely have a self-hosted or linux kind of trivia night. I know I threatened it at the denver meetup last year

02:37.920 --> 02:39.920
But how about we make something happen?

02:40.080 --> 02:42.080
At the jpl meetup. Oh

02:42.800 --> 02:44.800
Oh

02:44.800 --> 02:50.560
Oh speaking of which just a little early plug in the show self-hosted dot show slash jpl

02:51.040 --> 02:55.280
If you're in the southern california area and you want to put your name in the hat for the jpl tour

02:56.240 --> 03:00.980
That's where you go. But please make sure you can actually make it self-hosted dot show slash jpl

03:02.320 --> 03:03.600
I have been

03:03.600 --> 03:06.980
Just sitting here waiting for this episode. I wanted to hear brent's opinions

03:06.980 --> 03:14.420
Of what it's like to live in your house after you have automated everything because you have built that entire system to fit your

03:14.900 --> 03:17.860
Needs your family's needs, right? You didn't build it for brent's needs

03:18.260 --> 03:22.740
And for a little while after you left, I don't think brent had access to the dashboard or anything like that

03:22.740 --> 03:24.740
So he just lived with the automations

03:24.980 --> 03:27.460
As they were so I thought it'd be really fun today

03:27.860 --> 03:33.940
to get in to just find out what that's like to live with another man's automations another man's home assistant and

03:33.940 --> 03:41.460
then kind of get a review from a third-party perspective on your setup and then also later in the show I got a

03:41.940 --> 03:42.900
shelly

03:42.900 --> 03:47.060
humidity and temperature sensor and I got one of their power plugs

03:47.620 --> 03:49.780
And I have them running right now and I want to share my thoughts

03:50.420 --> 03:56.900
On that stuff. But what do you guys say? We jump into brent's impressions of living with your assistant alex because

03:58.180 --> 04:02.820
I was actually really interested when brent stayed with us in the rv. What his experience was like, but

04:02.820 --> 04:06.520
One of the things that I did. I don't think you had time for just because of circumstances

04:07.220 --> 04:10.420
Was when the first night brent stayed with us. I gave him a little tour

04:10.980 --> 04:15.220
Of the system to kind of show him how to control it where the where the tablets were at

04:15.220 --> 04:22.020
But you guys basically had like a meet and greet in the in the airport and then it was like, yeah two planes in the night

04:22.020 --> 04:24.020
passing

04:24.020 --> 04:28.340
That was not the original plan how many hours delayed were you like 19 or something? Yeah

04:28.340 --> 04:33.460
Yeah, I had to do an overnight and all hotel and all the whole thing. So

04:34.180 --> 04:37.700
Anyways, we met on the security side of the airport. That was fun. I haven't done that before

04:38.500 --> 04:44.820
but luckily I uh because of the raleigh meetup that we did here I did have some experience with the

04:45.200 --> 04:52.660
Automations and chris. I know you also had some experiences here. We all did and alex was kind of showcasing them at the time

04:52.660 --> 04:58.180
Um because it was the first time any of us had seen sort of everything he set up in the new house

04:58.660 --> 05:00.660
And I followed some of it with the show as well

05:00.820 --> 05:03.220
You know like alex and I have talked about some of it on the show

05:03.380 --> 05:06.260
So I kind of when I arrived at alex's house

05:06.660 --> 05:08.660
I pretty much knew what to expect

05:08.740 --> 05:14.340
Right away because it's something he and I kind of talk about more frequently than probably I would imagine the two of you do

05:14.660 --> 05:18.980
It's true. I'm relatively new to uh home assistant home automation stuff

05:18.980 --> 05:25.620
But I uh, thanks to you chris. I do have nimble fingers around trying to operate some of it as an outside user

05:26.020 --> 05:31.460
This is an interesting question. Did much of it change from last time I was here to this time. No, I don't think so

05:32.020 --> 05:36.500
Okay, good. That was going to be my answer. So I had some patterns in mind. I know that

05:37.460 --> 05:39.460
Alex and cat have certain

05:39.860 --> 05:41.780
Routines that they set off

05:41.780 --> 05:49.300
One of them even when I visited them years ago in their old place was their like good night routine and uh, sort of

05:49.300 --> 05:53.460
The bedtime countdown and all the lights would sort of dim down a little bit

05:53.940 --> 05:58.660
And I kind of missed that when you were gone because I a didn't know how to set that off

05:59.380 --> 06:01.380
and b like

06:01.380 --> 06:06.340
I didn't know even know where to start looking for like random switches or physical

06:06.880 --> 06:10.660
Uh enablements to make that happen. And uh, so I just lived with that

06:10.660 --> 06:14.180
But so sad. I think I need to improve my documentation, huh?

06:15.060 --> 06:17.060
That's the first thing to go out of date typically

06:17.220 --> 06:24.260
So I used to do the bedtime routine through a google home with a hey tube, please

06:24.340 --> 06:27.300
Uh, what what did I say? I think I just said bedtime

06:27.860 --> 06:33.700
Yeah, something like that. That's what you used when I stayed with you. Uh, but now I have the ikea trad free buttons

06:34.020 --> 06:37.860
I have one of these next to my uh bed, you know just in the bedroom

06:37.860 --> 06:43.220
And when I want to shut the house down, I just press the button and it starts the uh, it shuts down

06:43.220 --> 06:46.820
I think it turns off all the lights. It sets the ac to uh, you know

06:46.900 --> 06:49.460
A slightly warmer temperature overnight to save me a bit of money

06:50.180 --> 06:52.260
It turns off all the outdoor lights

06:52.900 --> 06:59.700
Turns off several smart plugs as well as like the garage door openers ensures the garage doors are shut that kind of thing. Okay

07:01.380 --> 07:05.380
Very nice and I have something very similar at home as well. We have uh

07:05.380 --> 07:09.860
Uh kid bedtime, which is a kind of reduced version of that

07:09.940 --> 07:13.620
That just gets everything shut down for the kids and then we have what I call

07:14.260 --> 07:19.780
Last call and and I picked a name that wasn't good night because some of the smart assistants

07:20.420 --> 07:22.980
Actually have like a predefined response for good night

07:23.380 --> 07:24.100
Yeah

07:24.100 --> 07:28.020
So I did last call for mine and that's just a script in home assistant

07:28.260 --> 07:32.260
It does pretty much similar to what alex said except for the garage doors

07:32.260 --> 07:37.860
I don't have those but it does turn cameras on shuts lights off. It turns on white noise makers

07:38.020 --> 07:43.700
It sets thermostats to certain temperatures and all of that kind of stuff and it does like alex does as well

07:43.780 --> 07:45.780
It does a cascade shutdown. So

07:46.180 --> 07:52.980
Things kind of selectively turn off in order so it gets darker in stages over a 15 minute period

07:53.620 --> 07:59.780
The other thing I have I think at night is I think it's 2 30 am or something. I have a hard cutoff

07:59.780 --> 08:03.940
It is i've experienced it because I I mean, you know, i've got kids now

08:03.940 --> 08:08.820
I'm a kid singular. I don't stay up that because she's up at six, you know, so

08:09.860 --> 08:17.700
2 30 am it hard turns off all the smart switches all the lights everything just as a catch-all in case anything didn't execute it

08:17.860 --> 08:19.060
at bedtime

08:19.060 --> 08:21.220
yeah, that tripped me up a few nights when I was

08:22.260 --> 08:24.260
Let's just say staying

08:24.260 --> 08:30.340
Staying on mountain time despite being in eastern time mountain time from what I guess from alex from what you're describing

08:30.340 --> 08:32.420
It seems to me like that would be a really common

08:33.380 --> 08:35.380
button or automation that

08:35.940 --> 08:38.420
Would have the most actions to it

08:38.580 --> 08:43.620
It sounds like chris you tons of stuff happens for you and alex tons of stuff happens for you at that time of day

08:43.620 --> 08:49.060
And I would assume any other time of day doesn't quite have that much stuff going on. It sounds like a lot

08:49.060 --> 08:54.580
But really all it's doing is turning off a couple of light groups and a couple of switch groups

08:55.300 --> 08:59.540
Because that you know, I have have everything grouped together. So it's really I mean

09:00.420 --> 09:05.460
I've added i've given it a lot of thoughts about what lives in which group but actually in terms of the number of steps

09:06.420 --> 09:10.180
There's a few timers and stuff in there too. But I mean, it's actually it's actually quite simple

09:10.260 --> 09:13.460
So the modular logic to it all makes it actually quite simple nice

09:13.460 --> 09:18.740
Yeah, depending on how you add groups and whatnot and I also have like some delays in there

09:18.900 --> 09:23.300
So one group will go off and then like a 10 minute timer goes for some stuff

09:23.860 --> 09:28.420
Uh, that's where it kind of gets a little weird, but that's just preference, you know, what I did learn last night

09:28.500 --> 09:30.500
however, is that uh

09:30.500 --> 09:36.900
Alex alluded that he and his wife katherine each have a button and they accomplish slightly different tasks

09:37.300 --> 09:41.540
Do you want to did you describe that? Do you want to make sure that's clear? Do we oh, yeah

09:41.540 --> 09:44.740
I thought you did there was like a we do. Oh, sorry

09:45.940 --> 09:52.340
I was sure you did you have like a soft good night and then a no. All right. All right. We tried that and it was just

09:52.980 --> 09:54.980
like chaos

09:55.540 --> 09:57.540
Because what happens if I go to bed first

09:57.620 --> 10:00.980
Well, I was gonna say that's what happened when we started watching rupaul's drag race

10:01.300 --> 10:06.740
Uh, you see so all that happens is I just push the bedtime button without thinking and because it's habit

10:06.740 --> 10:10.180
I go to bed. I push that button. So what I really need is a soft

10:10.180 --> 10:12.820
You know, just turn on my bedside light

10:13.540 --> 10:16.020
You know button and leave the rest of the house alone button

10:16.100 --> 10:19.700
I I think that really brings me to a nice segue which is that

10:20.020 --> 10:24.280
Having a brent in your home is a good way to find like little bugs in your automations

10:24.740 --> 10:29.540
Like that's that's a simple one, but here I am in england enjoying my sister's wedding

10:30.100 --> 10:33.780
And i've got a text from brent saying your kitchen lights aren't turning on bro

10:33.860 --> 10:38.980
Well, the other thing that's going to happen that'll force you to adjust this is you're going to have to create like a kid bedtime

10:38.980 --> 10:43.300
Automations like I have right? I have a partial kind of a soft bedtime for the kids

10:43.300 --> 10:47.700
Which which for me right? That's just shutting down the first half of the rv

10:47.700 --> 10:52.580
But leaving the back half of the rv still online, but for you it's going to be a lot more complicated

10:52.900 --> 10:56.580
I think as well that this speaks to a good point about home automation in general

10:57.380 --> 11:00.900
Lately i've really struggled to find it interesting because

11:02.020 --> 11:05.060
There are so many edge cases that you have to consider

11:05.060 --> 11:12.020
And the entropy of stuff just breaking a good example of these bluetooth low energy temperature sensors that I have the xiaomi

11:13.220 --> 11:18.660
I forget the name of them. You know, they're made by xiaomi. Anyway, yep, they just drop off the network

11:18.820 --> 11:20.020
They just drop off bluetooth

11:20.020 --> 11:25.060
Even though the esp 32 is still online because I can ping the damn thing and I can log into it still there

11:25.380 --> 11:28.500
stuff just breaks which doesn't quite work 100 reliably and

11:29.460 --> 11:31.300
I don't know. I'm getting a bit fatigued with it

11:31.300 --> 11:35.860
No, I understand too because when a temperature sensor breaks a bunch of other crap breaks and that's really annoying

11:35.940 --> 11:40.420
So it's a bit of a domino effect then I will say i'm going to get to this one and we get to the shelly stuff

11:40.900 --> 11:44.900
Wi-fi z-waver zigbee only for me from now on because of this very reason

11:45.540 --> 11:49.460
And nothing battery powered when it comes to sensors where I want a lot of data from

11:50.340 --> 11:55.060
You know just to kind of circle back to the original idea I had here for just kind of picking brent's brain on this

11:55.380 --> 11:57.380
I'm curious what you thought worked well brent

11:57.380 --> 12:02.500
We kind of got an idea of what maybe didn't work, but i'm curious what you were impressed by or you thought was nice

12:02.660 --> 12:08.020
While you were staying there, you know, it's it's actually a difficult question to answer because the the things that work nicely

12:08.020 --> 12:10.020
You just sort of forget

12:10.660 --> 12:12.660
If you're not noticing it means that it's working

12:13.220 --> 12:20.020
Which is kind of fascinating speaking of the kitchen lights then so I have an automation based on a uh, I think it's a hue

12:20.500 --> 12:23.220
Zigbee motion sensor that talks to my conby 2

12:23.220 --> 12:29.860
It's attached to the lights if it's got a magnetic back to it and it's angled such that it picks up both

12:30.740 --> 12:32.740
Oh, actually all three entry points to my kitchen

12:33.460 --> 12:36.260
If you're sat at the dinner table for more than about 10 minutes

12:37.220 --> 12:40.180
Still which with a toddler does not happen

12:41.220 --> 12:45.620
The lights will turn off and so my time out was you know, I think it was seven minutes actually not 10

12:46.420 --> 12:50.340
So the first few days I get a message from brent saying your kitchen lights keep turning off

12:50.340 --> 12:54.020
On me or they're not the motion sensor isn't picking me up properly. Yeah here

12:54.020 --> 12:59.700
I am having a nice peaceful dinner being my wonderfully cooked meal and the lights keep turning off on me

13:00.100 --> 13:03.060
so I adjusted the time out to 25 minutes just

13:03.780 --> 13:06.820
Thinking that was the longest possible time a human could spend eating dinner

13:07.460 --> 13:12.580
No, not brent. How did that work out for you in the end? I'm curious, you know for like a sit down at the table dinner

13:12.660 --> 13:15.460
Which um for you is over pretty quickly

13:15.460 --> 13:20.660
But for me was obviously the need for the change, uh, that was totally great. Um, where it changed was

13:21.220 --> 13:26.180
I've discovered that really cozy chair that you have in the kitchen. It's like a lounge chair. Yeah, one of those ikea

13:27.460 --> 13:31.940
Chairs, so archie and I would often like curl up there during thunderstorms and so right

13:32.100 --> 13:35.300
But the lights would go out and actually that was a feature I think so

13:35.300 --> 13:36.500
I didn't ask you to change it

13:36.500 --> 13:39.940
Right brent can be a still man for a prolonged period of time

13:39.940 --> 13:46.100
But isn't this this is exactly what I was talking about you guys like you build something for yourself and then somebody comes along

13:46.100 --> 13:48.100
Who just doesn't live the way you live?

13:48.580 --> 13:52.740
And they find the edge cases and I just find that just fascinating. Yeah, it's a difference in behavior

13:53.060 --> 13:58.340
And alex was kind enough to hand me a login to the interface to make some changes

13:58.340 --> 14:04.100
But I was too scared to change things in there because I feel like if he if he's that way about his desk chair

14:04.100 --> 14:07.300
Who knows how he is about his home assistant. He's got a lot of stuff

14:07.300 --> 14:11.700
Chair, who knows how he is about his home assistant. He's got backups of his config

14:11.780 --> 14:16.100
He doesn't have backups of the physical chair. He wants me to test the backups. Does he I do?

14:18.020 --> 14:21.720
Uh, what do they call that uh in enterprise disaster recovery

14:23.460 --> 14:26.660
You are the disaster. Oh, thank you. I need a t-shirt

14:27.780 --> 14:32.340
Uh, but chris to answer your original question, I would say a lot of the lights worked really well

14:32.340 --> 14:37.220
Alex as you know has a bunch of mood lights in this particular room where we are which is kind of you call it

14:37.220 --> 14:40.180
Your bonus room, but it's kind of the lounge or the tinkering

14:40.260 --> 14:43.540
You know your desk is there where you do a lot of your tinkering and that's where we are right now

14:44.260 --> 14:47.060
and it's kind of this mood lighting that is

14:47.620 --> 14:51.380
Just I never thought of except about 2 30 in the morning when it all turned off

14:51.460 --> 14:56.020
But other than that which was most of the time it was just perfect and I didn't have to think about it

14:56.100 --> 15:00.980
And it was just right for the time of day. I thought that was really great and really added to the room

15:00.980 --> 15:08.020
I'm quite proud of the lighting in this room in particular because it's based off of the elevation of the sun

15:08.900 --> 15:14.740
Rather than time of day or anything like that. So as the sun's elevation in the sky changes throughout the year

15:15.460 --> 15:20.500
So does the uh, I guess the light turn on off time. Yeah. Okay, that's great

15:21.380 --> 15:23.380
That's really neat. What gave you that idea?

15:24.260 --> 15:27.220
I think just a forum post. I wish I could I wish I could take credit

15:27.220 --> 15:31.700
But I love that you can even do that really let's be honest. Yeah, one thing i'd like to do

15:31.780 --> 15:37.640
I've and if any listeners have an idea i've got a a skylight behind me here and it's got a proprietary

15:38.660 --> 15:40.660
Velux shade on it

15:40.900 --> 15:47.700
And I leave it open about two or three inches because during the day the sun blasts through that because it's a south-facing roof

15:48.340 --> 15:52.660
And it would just discolor my drums and get them hot and you know instruments are quite sensitive

15:52.660 --> 15:57.300
So what i'd love is during the day whilst the sun is beating down for that thing to be

15:57.700 --> 16:00.260
You know in its daytime position almost all the way down

16:00.900 --> 16:05.780
And then of an evening open it right up once the sun's done doing its thing for the day

16:06.420 --> 16:11.540
I'm tempted to take apart the remote that I have the velux remote. It's uh, some kind of wireless thing

16:11.540 --> 16:14.660
I don't know what protocol it uses, but apparently it does rolling encryption

16:15.460 --> 16:18.340
So you can't just sniff it with 433 or something like that

16:18.340 --> 16:24.020
Uh, so what i'm tempted to do is get an esp device and kind of solder a couple of leads on and have that

16:24.100 --> 16:28.420
Kind of fake button pushes, but I don't want to break the only remote that I have

16:29.700 --> 16:31.700
For the thing. I wonder if you could get

16:32.420 --> 16:37.860
Like a replacement remote a second remote that one to play with and one to be, you know your production remote

16:37.940 --> 16:43.380
Yeah, if anybody has any experience with those velux remotes, i'd love to hear from you self-hosted dot show slash contact

16:43.380 --> 16:49.460
Humio dot com slash h c e go there to get all of your logs in one place

16:50.260 --> 16:53.860
Humio is a centralized log management and observability platform

16:54.420 --> 17:01.060
The company was founded by developers in denmark in 2016 as an alternative to the legacy logging solutions that I tried back in my day

17:01.540 --> 17:05.460
They're just cost prohibitive and unbelievable in scale and size

17:05.620 --> 17:10.660
I think the real beauty of humio is that it can take logs from any source and then it makes them usable

17:10.660 --> 17:14.740
You don't have to sit there and constantly massage the format. It doesn't need a schema

17:14.820 --> 17:20.820
You just pump them all in there. And then when you need them the dashboard helps you get sense of it. I

17:21.700 --> 17:25.460
Cannot underscore this enough back in my day when I was in it

17:26.100 --> 17:31.380
Specifically in banking where we had to audit our firewall logs constantly. I am not kidding you

17:32.100 --> 17:35.300
We spent a month training the system on what to look for

17:36.260 --> 17:40.180
That's how wild these things are. So what we did was we took our firewall logs

17:40.180 --> 17:45.060
And we looked at all of these different ways that we can get our data out of this system

17:45.540 --> 17:50.100
So that's how wild these things are. So what humio is doing is crazy

17:50.180 --> 17:55.860
It's index free architecture means you can ingest over a petabyte of data per day and then search that with sub

17:56.660 --> 17:57.780
second

17:57.780 --> 18:04.580
Latency and humio is up to 80 cheaper than competing platforms like Splunk or elastic thanks to its reduced hardware footprint

18:04.580 --> 18:07.960
is the largest no-cost data ingestion offering

18:07.960 --> 18:09.320
on the market today,

18:09.320 --> 18:11.760
allowing you to ingest up to 16 gigs per day

18:11.760 --> 18:13.080
with seven days of retention.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.520
It's not a trial period.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.360
You get that for the long haul.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.880
How useful could that be when you're troubleshooting

18:18.880 --> 18:19.840
or monitoring your system

18:19.840 --> 18:21.840
or bringing everything together in one place?

18:21.840 --> 18:23.920
It's perfect for self-hosters

18:23.920 --> 18:25.880
who just want to ingest all those logs

18:25.880 --> 18:27.760
and then view it on a dashboard.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.240
You gotta go try Humio right now

18:29.240 --> 18:30.440
to see what I'm talking about

18:30.440 --> 18:32.960
and get that community edition for the long haul.

18:32.960 --> 18:37.960
So to do that, you go to humio.com slash H-C-E.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.100
When it's your hobby, you want it easy.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.680
You want it quick and you want it usable.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.160
You don't want it to be a job.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.760
You want to be able to get to the bottom of things

18:45.760 --> 18:48.300
and having that all in one dashboard is beautiful.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.200
And of course, you can get metrics from Home Assistant.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.640
So go get started with Humio Community Edition

18:53.640 --> 18:57.980
right now for free at humio.com slash H-C-E.

18:57.980 --> 19:02.980
That's humio.com slash H-C-E.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.600
Now, I was hoping to take a moment in the show

19:06.600 --> 19:10.680
just to reach out to friend of the show, Jeff Geerling.

19:10.680 --> 19:13.360
He posted a video on his YouTube channel today

19:13.360 --> 19:14.660
about his Crohn's disease.

19:14.660 --> 19:15.520
For those of you that don't know,

19:15.520 --> 19:16.960
Jeff suffers from Crohn's disease,

19:16.960 --> 19:19.440
which is quite debilitating disease

19:19.440 --> 19:22.080
of the intestine and gut sort of area.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.440
He hasn't been very well lately

19:23.440 --> 19:26.280
and his latest video says he's gonna drop

19:26.280 --> 19:29.040
from weekly to bi-weekly uploads of videos,

19:29.040 --> 19:30.580
that kind of thing.

19:30.580 --> 19:32.640
At this time, I don't really know what I can do

19:32.640 --> 19:35.040
to help with that other than get you lot

19:35.040 --> 19:38.840
to message him on Twitter with kind words of encouragement

19:38.840 --> 19:40.020
to say we're all thinking of you

19:40.020 --> 19:43.760
and hope that you make it through.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.920
Yeah, I'm very sorry to hear that.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.000
Get well, Jeff.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.400
The challenge when you are running your own business

19:51.400 --> 19:55.080
and trying to do your own media empire like Jeff has,

19:55.080 --> 19:57.780
you are kind of the star of the show.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.260
And when you have health issues,

20:00.260 --> 20:02.340
it just knocks things out of whack

20:02.340 --> 20:03.380
and it takes you off the air.

20:03.380 --> 20:04.780
So I know how rough that can be, Jeff.

20:04.780 --> 20:07.300
So all my best.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.740
Gentlemen, will you entertain me for a moment?

20:09.740 --> 20:12.140
I'd love to tell you about some new Shelly devices

20:12.140 --> 20:13.300
that I have received.

20:13.300 --> 20:14.900
Oh, that's not, I'm doing jazz hands.

20:14.900 --> 20:15.740
That's not what you meant.

20:15.740 --> 20:17.980
Oh, I mean, actually that's quite entertaining.

20:17.980 --> 20:18.820
I'm very entertaining.

20:18.820 --> 20:20.300
Thank you.

20:20.300 --> 20:21.460
Thank you very much.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.880
So you guys know I have been on a trek

20:23.880 --> 20:26.540
to look at what I'm gonna replace in my setup

20:26.540 --> 20:29.420
when I redo Home Assistant and redo my Z-Wave

20:29.420 --> 20:31.340
and maybe set up some ZigBay

20:31.340 --> 20:33.260
and get rid of my Home Assistant stuff.

20:33.260 --> 20:35.820
And I have been really intrigued for a long time

20:35.820 --> 20:36.660
by the Shelly stuff

20:36.660 --> 20:38.460
since you first talked about it on the show, Alex.

20:38.460 --> 20:40.840
It just seems like such a slam dunk.

20:42.020 --> 20:46.220
And recently I talked about their temperature sensor

20:46.220 --> 20:48.860
and the temperature sensor is really, really great

20:48.860 --> 20:52.200
because it has an e-ink display on it

20:52.200 --> 20:55.420
and it will give you the temperature

20:55.420 --> 20:57.900
and the humidity of the room right there

20:57.900 --> 20:59.220
on the e-ink display.

20:59.220 --> 21:03.000
And that, guys, that sold me and it's Wi-Fi

21:03.000 --> 21:06.100
so I don't gotta mess around with ZigBay or Z-Wave

21:06.100 --> 21:07.740
because I still, I don't know why,

21:07.740 --> 21:09.220
but I'm still waiting for matter.

21:09.220 --> 21:10.420
I know, I know, I know.

21:10.420 --> 21:12.100
So I wanna just go for Wi-Fi if I can

21:12.100 --> 21:15.500
and start replacing my Z-Wave devices with Wi-Fi devices.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.120
And the number one device,

21:17.120 --> 21:19.540
the number one device that I have on Z-Wave

21:19.540 --> 21:23.540
is my Aotec 7-in-1 or 6-in-1 sensor,

21:23.540 --> 21:27.660
which is still chef's kiss the best sensor out there.

21:27.660 --> 21:30.420
But I wanna replace Z-Wave devices with Wi-Fi devices

21:30.420 --> 21:34.200
and the Shelly H&T sensor, humidity and temperature sensor,

21:34.200 --> 21:35.140
seem like the way to go.

21:35.140 --> 21:36.420
E-ink display seems great.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.340
It has USB-C for power.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.260
So you can supply always on power.

21:41.260 --> 21:43.300
You don't have to use battery.

21:43.300 --> 21:46.300
As probably a lot of you know traditionally,

21:46.300 --> 21:48.500
that means that if you can give USB power

21:48.500 --> 21:50.060
to one of these IOT devices,

21:50.060 --> 21:52.220
they will send continuous data.

21:52.220 --> 21:54.220
And if they're on battery,

21:54.220 --> 21:55.940
they have, maybe they'll wake up

21:55.940 --> 21:58.320
when a certain threshold is reached.

21:58.320 --> 22:02.180
Maybe they wake up when a certain time threshold

22:02.180 --> 22:03.480
has been reached, right?

22:03.480 --> 22:06.340
There's different things that can cause them to wake up,

22:06.340 --> 22:08.380
but they don't continuously report.

22:08.380 --> 22:10.420
And so for me, like I have temperature sensors

22:10.420 --> 22:11.740
in my battery bay,

22:11.740 --> 22:13.520
but I need to monitor in real time right away.

22:13.520 --> 22:16.500
I can't wait an hour to get a temperature update.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.620
I need to know right now.

22:18.620 --> 22:21.700
So anything that can be powered continuously

22:21.700 --> 22:22.980
is a win for me.

22:22.980 --> 22:26.200
And the Shelly H&T sensor absolutely can.

22:27.580 --> 22:31.140
However, I have to let you know some bad news.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.260
Even when you have it plugged in over USB,

22:36.260 --> 22:38.420
sleep is still required

22:38.420 --> 22:42.420
because the CPU heat throws off the temperature readings.

22:42.420 --> 22:45.580
And so the hardware has to go in sleep mode

22:45.580 --> 22:47.260
to try to get the temperature setting,

22:47.260 --> 22:49.540
or reading, I should say, as accurate as possible.

22:49.540 --> 22:51.620
That is a real shame.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.940
And do we know how long this sleep has to be?

22:53.940 --> 22:56.140
It's enough that it disconnects completely

22:56.140 --> 22:59.540
from Home Assistant and becomes a dead sensor.

22:59.540 --> 23:00.940
And it's a display.

23:00.940 --> 23:01.900
That's just no good.

23:01.900 --> 23:06.020
Yeah, if you don't want continuous data

23:06.020 --> 23:07.860
and you're okay using MQTT

23:07.860 --> 23:10.260
to kind of send it when it is alive,

23:10.260 --> 23:11.900
so that way Home Assistant doesn't freak out

23:11.900 --> 23:14.500
every time it disappears, it'll work.

23:14.500 --> 23:17.260
Now, I can't help with the e-ink side of this thing,

23:17.260 --> 23:22.060
but I mean, it looks beautiful, but first of all, $40?

23:22.060 --> 23:24.180
That's expensive for something

23:24.180 --> 23:25.980
that has this kind of a flaw in it.

23:27.540 --> 23:30.120
And when I look at it, I look at this and I think,

23:30.120 --> 23:33.780
well, you know, just use an ESP8266

23:33.780 --> 23:37.240
and a $5 sensor from China.

23:37.240 --> 23:38.500
I've been using one in my basement

23:38.500 --> 23:41.780
and one in my attic for the last three, four years.

23:41.780 --> 23:43.380
A generous listener even sent me one.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.780
You are absolutely right.

23:44.780 --> 23:46.420
And that is what I should do.

23:46.420 --> 23:50.580
I know that, but I don't know what it is, Alex.

23:50.580 --> 23:52.380
Like, I just, I can't accept it

23:52.380 --> 23:53.940
that that has to be the answer.

23:53.940 --> 23:56.740
For this to ever get any kind of mainstream acceptance,

23:56.740 --> 23:59.620
it can't be I have to go build a device

23:59.620 --> 24:01.460
and then connect it over MQTT.

24:01.460 --> 24:03.900
Like, that just can't be the answer

24:03.900 --> 24:06.460
because that's such a self-selecting set of people

24:06.460 --> 24:08.580
that can ever actually accomplish that.

24:08.580 --> 24:10.880
And it's just, when I hit those walls, I go,

24:10.880 --> 24:13.820
I could do this, but I wouldn't even expect

24:13.820 --> 24:15.900
80% of the audience to do that.

24:15.900 --> 24:18.540
And they are listening to a self-hosting podcast.

24:18.540 --> 24:19.880
No, you're totally right.

24:19.880 --> 24:24.400
And it's, even when designing the 3D printed enclosures

24:24.400 --> 24:26.500
for these ESP devices,

24:26.500 --> 24:29.500
there are considerations given to the heat

24:29.500 --> 24:33.380
that even the little ESP board generates.

24:33.380 --> 24:35.020
I am very surprised that Shelley

24:35.020 --> 24:37.840
haven't been able to work around this with this device.

24:37.840 --> 24:40.680
I mean, it's very disappointing.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.100
I think what you're really suggesting

24:42.100 --> 24:44.380
is drilling a few holes in the case, aren't you?

24:44.380 --> 24:49.380
You know, the way the Aotech sensor gets around this

24:49.980 --> 24:52.780
is it's a completely different reading mechanism.

24:52.780 --> 24:55.220
It has a bulb on the front of the sensor

24:55.220 --> 24:58.820
and it projects some sort of sensor reading outwardly.

24:58.820 --> 25:02.140
So it measures out in front of the sensor

25:02.140 --> 25:04.260
and not at the sensor level like that.

25:04.260 --> 25:06.840
The Shelley is taking air into the housing

25:08.060 --> 25:09.560
and then measuring that, right?

25:09.560 --> 25:12.460
Where the Aotechs are doing some sort of

25:12.460 --> 25:14.100
like infrared projection

25:14.100 --> 25:16.180
and then measuring it some amount of feet

25:16.180 --> 25:17.660
outside of the sensor.

25:17.660 --> 25:21.340
And so for me, because the Aotechs can be plugged in over USB

25:21.340 --> 25:26.260
and report continuously, that to me is a pro.

25:26.260 --> 25:28.500
And I have to be honest with you,

25:28.500 --> 25:31.940
the old man in me is not really comfortable putting,

25:31.940 --> 25:35.060
I mean, conservatively 70 IoT devices on wifi.

25:35.060 --> 25:37.460
That just doesn't seem like it's gonna scale.

25:37.460 --> 25:40.340
Where something like Z-Wave or even Zigbee,

25:40.340 --> 25:41.900
but I'm more familiar with Z-Wave.

25:41.900 --> 25:44.900
Z-Wave, every device you add to the network

25:44.900 --> 25:47.540
becomes a transmitter and a rebroadcaster

25:47.540 --> 25:49.220
and it builds a mesh network.

25:49.220 --> 25:51.260
It makes the network even stronger.

25:51.260 --> 25:56.260
And plus, I like having all of my sensor devices

25:56.380 --> 25:59.140
and switches, I like having them off wifi

25:59.140 --> 26:01.720
because then I can reboot my DHCP server

26:01.720 --> 26:05.020
or my wifi APs or whatever.

26:05.020 --> 26:08.020
And all of my sensors and switches keep working.

26:08.020 --> 26:09.620
So I'm not actually sure wifi

26:09.620 --> 26:10.940
is the way to go for this stuff.

26:10.940 --> 26:13.060
Even though that's kind of why I started looking into it,

26:13.060 --> 26:16.020
the more I use it, I don't think I,

26:16.020 --> 26:18.540
for my stuff, I don't know if I want wifi.

26:18.540 --> 26:21.140
Finding a balance, like anything,

26:21.140 --> 26:25.640
certain spots in your RV will be better served by devices

26:25.640 --> 26:27.660
which are wifi based

26:27.660 --> 26:31.340
and others will be better served by Zigbee.

26:31.340 --> 26:32.900
And we had some real time feedback

26:32.900 --> 26:35.260
in the Discord from Fuzzy Mistborn

26:35.260 --> 26:38.600
about the Acara Zigbee temperature sensor.

26:38.600 --> 26:41.020
Now I've been using a couple of these myself, actually.

26:41.020 --> 26:44.420
I've got one in my fridge and one in my freezer.

26:44.420 --> 26:46.600
And the one in the freezer runs out of battery

26:46.600 --> 26:50.380
because the battery gets too cold almost all the time.

26:50.380 --> 26:52.260
So I know that my freezer is fine

26:52.260 --> 26:56.820
because the battery is zonked out, the voltage is too low.

26:56.820 --> 26:59.000
So as soon as that sensor comes back online,

26:59.000 --> 27:00.820
then I know that it's warmed up.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.820
Goodness.

27:03.820 --> 27:05.740
But the fridge one works well at, you know,

27:05.740 --> 27:08.020
if that sort of five Celsius sort of temperature,

27:08.020 --> 27:09.540
it works just fine.

27:09.540 --> 27:14.260
At minus 18 Celsius, I mean, that's tough.

27:14.260 --> 27:16.380
Since they're watching live, I'd love to know,

27:16.380 --> 27:18.620
does it take USB power and can it do continuous?

27:18.620 --> 27:21.020
Because if it does, I might pick that up.

27:21.020 --> 27:23.620
No, it uses one of those little coin cell batteries.

27:23.620 --> 27:26.200
I love the continuous data. I really do.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.720
I don't want hour gaps because what you get in the charts,

27:28.720 --> 27:31.600
for one thing, is like these inorganic jumps.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.860
And I really want to see, like, I immediately, it just,

27:34.860 --> 27:37.180
this was relevant just two weeks ago for me.

27:37.180 --> 27:39.460
I want to know immediately if the changes I have made

27:39.460 --> 27:41.580
are lowering the temperatures. I can't wait.

27:41.580 --> 27:44.100
So I'd love to try something Zigbee, though,

27:44.100 --> 27:48.380
that could be battery or USB and could give me real-time data

27:48.380 --> 27:51.020
and has a direct integration, doesn't require MQTT.

27:51.020 --> 27:53.380
If anybody knows, I'll try it here at the studio.

27:53.380 --> 27:56.980
What are they using on Mars? Can we get our hands on that?

27:56.980 --> 27:59.060
They are using Zigbee on Mars.

27:59.060 --> 28:02.300
I have an inkling that they are, yeah.

28:02.300 --> 28:03.900
I bet they have temperature sensors, right?

28:03.900 --> 28:06.540
That's what I'm saying. We know some people.

28:06.540 --> 28:08.380
We might be able to get samples.

28:08.380 --> 28:10.960
Yeah, maybe. Maybe. We'll find out about that.

28:10.960 --> 28:13.740
But if you wanted to use the device directly

28:13.740 --> 28:16.300
without Home Assistant and maybe just wanted to use the app

28:16.300 --> 28:18.380
for the humidity and temperature sensor,

28:18.380 --> 28:20.420
or you're comfortable just using MQTT

28:20.420 --> 28:22.340
or maybe replacing the firmware,

28:22.340 --> 28:25.340
these are really nice temperature sensors.

28:25.340 --> 28:27.940
With the only caveat being, for me,

28:27.940 --> 28:30.360
they read a few degrees high continuously.

28:30.360 --> 28:33.180
And maybe that's because of the temperature issues

28:33.180 --> 28:36.620
I mentioned, but I had temperature sensors side by side.

28:36.620 --> 28:40.100
And the Shelly sometimes read as much as seven degrees hotter

28:40.100 --> 28:42.160
than the temperature sensor right next to it.

28:42.160 --> 28:43.660
Wow, that is a lot.

28:43.660 --> 28:45.600
So I'm holding up to the stream here.

28:45.600 --> 28:50.180
This is an ESP8266 and a DHT22.

28:50.180 --> 28:53.860
And this little setup here costs less than $10.

28:53.860 --> 28:56.820
And all you need is a couple of jumper wires, honestly,

28:56.820 --> 29:00.720
and then it's powered through a micro USB port on there.

29:00.720 --> 29:03.500
And this stuff you can order from China, from AliExpress,

29:03.500 --> 29:07.400
you know, for a couple of dollars a piece, honestly.

29:07.400 --> 29:10.200
It's super cheap if you're willing to wait for the shipping.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.460
So Chris, what I'm going to do,

29:12.460 --> 29:14.180
I'm going to make a few of these for you,

29:14.180 --> 29:15.980
and I'm going to 3D print some cases,

29:15.980 --> 29:17.980
because I'm fed up of hearing you talk about it.

29:17.980 --> 29:22.140
I'm going to 3D print this into a little case for you.

29:22.140 --> 29:24.940
And then we can use command strips,

29:24.940 --> 29:27.820
ding, ding, to put this on the wall of a lady dupes.

29:27.820 --> 29:29.140
And I'll make you a couple of these.

29:29.140 --> 29:32.140
All right, you can hand them to me at the JPL meetup.

29:32.140 --> 29:33.580
Exactly what I was thinking.

29:33.580 --> 29:34.700
Hey, that's great.

29:34.700 --> 29:36.920
I'm hoping the case is going to be Levi shaped,

29:36.920 --> 29:38.140
just putting that out there.

29:38.140 --> 29:41.620
That's quite the print job.

29:41.620 --> 29:43.960
Customer requirements are the worst.

29:45.460 --> 29:46.620
Maybe just a dog collar.

29:46.620 --> 29:47.460
I don't know what's easier to print.

29:47.460 --> 29:48.540
You're not even the customer.

29:48.540 --> 29:50.940
I'm just advocating for the customer.

29:50.940 --> 29:52.820
He does that kind of thing all the time, Alex.

29:52.820 --> 29:53.660
You got to watch out.

29:53.660 --> 29:56.100
I know, scope creep.

29:56.100 --> 29:59.760
Just super quickly too, I did try the Shelly Power.

29:59.760 --> 30:02.580
Out of all the Shelly devices I have tried,

30:02.580 --> 30:04.380
this is the one.

30:04.380 --> 30:06.100
This is a great device.

30:06.100 --> 30:08.100
This is a great device.

30:08.100 --> 30:11.260
This is my new smart plug, full stop right here.

30:11.260 --> 30:13.500
Or the cloudfree.shop version,

30:13.500 --> 30:15.580
because maybe it's the same thing.

30:15.580 --> 30:18.140
I really, really like this smart plug,

30:18.140 --> 30:20.360
so much so that I have already installed one

30:20.360 --> 30:23.200
here in the studio as well as one at home.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.220
As I expected, it's just way better

30:25.220 --> 30:27.300
than the low power devices because it's always on.

30:27.300 --> 30:29.340
It's plugged into your wall outlet, right?

30:29.340 --> 30:31.500
And it doesn't have the low power issues.

30:31.500 --> 30:32.700
It's not a temperature sensor.

30:32.700 --> 30:35.140
It doesn't need to sleep to make sure the sensor's right.

30:35.140 --> 30:36.300
It just works.

30:36.300 --> 30:38.020
You plug it in.

30:38.020 --> 30:40.340
You join the little AP that it creates with your phone

30:40.340 --> 30:42.140
or whatever you want, your laptop.

30:42.140 --> 30:46.760
You can pull up the admin page at 192.168.33.1.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.700
It's the same for all Shelly devices,

30:48.700 --> 30:51.580
which I really appreciate having set up a bunch of them now.

30:51.580 --> 30:52.420
There you go.

30:52.420 --> 30:54.040
Is that the cloudfree.shop version you got there?

30:54.040 --> 30:55.460
This is the cloudfree one, yeah,

30:55.460 --> 30:57.260
but I have a feeling your Shelly one

30:57.260 --> 30:58.620
is in the exact same housing.

30:58.620 --> 30:59.460
Yeah, exactly.

30:59.460 --> 31:01.860
And before the cloudfree guys had it,

31:01.860 --> 31:04.300
this was a Tekkin SP20,

31:04.300 --> 31:07.620
and it used to use a TAS motor.

31:07.620 --> 31:08.960
I can't remember the name of it,

31:08.960 --> 31:11.460
but it did the man in the middle flashing thing

31:11.460 --> 31:13.580
to put the TAS motor firmer on it.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.880
But cloudfree ships with TAS motor on it.

31:15.880 --> 31:18.060
What does the Shelly firmware work well on it?

31:18.060 --> 31:20.040
Cause it's got their sort of cloud,

31:20.040 --> 31:21.660
their cloud stuff in it, right?

31:21.660 --> 31:22.500
I like it a lot.

31:22.500 --> 31:25.140
I think it has a really good set of built-in features.

31:25.140 --> 31:28.060
It has built into it without needing to connect

31:28.060 --> 31:31.580
to any kind of hub or home assistant or anything like that.

31:31.580 --> 31:33.500
You can do scheduled timers.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.660
You can set some advanced scheduled timers.

31:35.660 --> 31:36.580
It has web hooks,

31:36.580 --> 31:39.120
so you can integrate it with all kinds of things.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.460
It also supports Bluetooth

31:40.460 --> 31:42.860
if you don't wanna mess around with wifi.

31:42.860 --> 31:44.920
And it has really good power monitoring,

31:44.920 --> 31:48.020
really good accurate power monitoring built into it.

31:48.020 --> 31:49.620
And it also supports advanced features

31:49.620 --> 31:51.540
like joining wifi and MQTT,

31:51.540 --> 31:53.540
if you wanna use that kind of stuff.

31:53.540 --> 31:56.880
And the web UI is totally usable out of the box

31:56.880 --> 31:58.260
and their app is not bad either.

31:58.260 --> 32:00.620
So all in all, even if you never had home assistant,

32:00.620 --> 32:02.300
these are really nice smart plugs.

32:02.300 --> 32:04.760
Now, Alex, when I was here last,

32:04.760 --> 32:06.760
we installed some Shelly devices.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.700
They were, I believe relays that we threw

32:08.700 --> 32:12.460
into a surprising number of your light switches,

32:12.460 --> 32:15.260
both new switches we put in and old switches.

32:15.260 --> 32:17.400
How did those do in the last two months?

32:17.400 --> 32:20.140
Well, you tell me, did you notice them?

32:20.140 --> 32:21.420
I would say I didn't.

32:21.420 --> 32:23.540
Oh, the one in your server room,

32:23.540 --> 32:26.340
the basement that you set up to open.

32:26.340 --> 32:27.180
That one, yeah.

32:27.180 --> 32:28.540
As soon as the door opens,

32:28.540 --> 32:30.640
you open that door and the light comes on

32:30.640 --> 32:31.820
and then you close the door.

32:31.820 --> 32:34.340
And well, I tried to figure out if, well, anyways.

32:34.340 --> 32:36.500
It's like half an hour, 45 minutes on that one.

32:36.500 --> 32:38.220
It's such a wonderful thing.

32:38.220 --> 32:40.640
But I was just curious if you had any issues

32:40.640 --> 32:41.980
that you saw on a daily basis,

32:41.980 --> 32:45.060
any kind of connectivity issues or reliability issues.

32:45.060 --> 32:45.900
Nope, they just work.

32:45.900 --> 32:47.580
They just work, which is the best kind of work.

32:47.580 --> 32:48.400
That's great,

32:48.400 --> 32:51.100
because if I had the DC electrical knowledge,

32:51.100 --> 32:53.180
I would wire those into all of the,

32:53.180 --> 32:54.220
what we call chore lights,

32:54.220 --> 32:56.300
which are the LED lights built into the RV.

32:56.300 --> 32:59.100
I would wire a Shelly into every single switch.

32:59.100 --> 33:01.020
I just don't know anything about DC power

33:01.020 --> 33:02.060
and any of that kind of,

33:02.060 --> 33:03.180
or if I could even fit them in the wall.

33:03.180 --> 33:04.180
But those are super cool

33:04.180 --> 33:06.520
because they turn a regular wall switch

33:06.520 --> 33:08.460
into basically a smart plug.

33:08.460 --> 33:11.860
And I think that's by far and above

33:11.860 --> 33:13.600
why we all know of Shelly.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.460
I think these smart plugs might be like

33:15.460 --> 33:17.140
their second best product.

33:17.140 --> 33:18.580
I really like this thing.

33:18.580 --> 33:19.860
And then of course,

33:19.860 --> 33:22.300
Home Assistant detects it within like three seconds

33:22.300 --> 33:23.660
once it's on your wifi.

33:23.660 --> 33:25.380
And because it doesn't go to sleep,

33:25.380 --> 33:27.540
it integrates perfectly with Home Assistant.

33:27.540 --> 33:29.680
All of the energy sensors are imported

33:29.680 --> 33:31.740
and it's working with the energy monitoring.

33:31.740 --> 33:33.340
It's really smooth.

33:33.340 --> 33:36.180
And I now have it set up here in the studio.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.460
So that way, when I stop recording,

33:38.460 --> 33:40.980
the fan turns on and I get a little bit of airflow.

33:40.980 --> 33:42.980
And then when we start recording, the fan turns off.

33:42.980 --> 33:44.260
Quality of life.

33:44.260 --> 33:47.940
So big thumbs up on the Shelly plugs

33:47.940 --> 33:49.840
and probably all of the devices

33:49.840 --> 33:51.460
based on the hardware platform.

33:51.460 --> 33:53.260
And also a double thumbs up

33:53.260 --> 33:55.920
because the things actually can handle

33:55.920 --> 33:58.340
a decent amount of throughput of power.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.500
Not all these smart plugs can actually handle

34:00.500 --> 34:02.660
the full capacity of a wall plug,

34:02.660 --> 34:03.620
but these ones can.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.100
Linode.com slash SSH.

34:07.100 --> 34:10.140
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

34:10.140 --> 34:12.100
And it's a great way to support the show.

34:12.100 --> 34:13.760
Linode is the Linux geeks cloud

34:13.760 --> 34:15.340
with 11 data centers worldwide.

34:15.340 --> 34:18.300
They've been hard at work for nearly 19 years

34:18.300 --> 34:21.380
creating the best experience to run applications on Linux.

34:21.380 --> 34:24.180
And as a self-hoster, I've been using it this summer

34:24.180 --> 34:27.720
when things get too hot in my quote unquote data center,

34:27.720 --> 34:30.020
which is my garage here at the studio.

34:30.020 --> 34:32.180
And I just, I did this last year

34:32.180 --> 34:34.400
and it worked again brilliantly this year.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.260
I did not get the cooling system in,

34:36.260 --> 34:38.220
just wasn't on the to-do list.

34:38.220 --> 34:40.420
Well, it was, it's just way down, way, way down,

34:40.420 --> 34:42.980
way down on the to-do list.

34:42.980 --> 34:44.580
And you know what?

34:44.580 --> 34:47.420
What I've done in the meantime has worked perfectly.

34:47.420 --> 34:49.540
I've migrated a couple of services to Linode,

34:49.540 --> 34:50.580
the ones I really need, right?

34:50.580 --> 34:52.540
Not like everything, but like the ones I really need.

34:52.540 --> 34:53.940
I put them up on Linode during the summer

34:53.940 --> 34:55.540
and I don't worry about it.

34:55.540 --> 34:56.740
It's so great.

34:56.740 --> 34:59.500
And of course, anything that's customer facing,

34:59.500 --> 35:01.420
quote unquote, but you know, really listeners,

35:01.420 --> 35:02.340
that's all on Linode.

35:02.340 --> 35:03.820
We would only put that stuff on Linode

35:03.820 --> 35:05.580
because the performance matters to us.

35:05.580 --> 35:07.900
And Linode's performance is top notch.

35:07.900 --> 35:10.660
Not just me saying that, but review after review

35:10.660 --> 35:13.300
of independent industry bodies also says it.

35:13.300 --> 35:14.620
I just wouldn't host all my stuff there

35:14.620 --> 35:15.580
if it wasn't the case.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.660
And they're always rolling out new features.

35:17.660 --> 35:20.220
They have VLAN support, they have MVMe storage

35:20.220 --> 35:23.700
if you want super fast storage, a powerful DNS manager,

35:23.700 --> 35:26.260
Kubernetes support, Terraform support.

35:26.260 --> 35:29.300
Of course, you can even do a bare metal system if you want.

35:29.300 --> 35:31.780
And probably the service I use besides just the hosting

35:31.780 --> 35:34.720
the most is their S3 compatible object storage.

35:34.720 --> 35:36.280
Changes the game on backups.

35:36.280 --> 35:38.120
It's also how we do the backend file storage

35:38.120 --> 35:42.300
for our next cloud instance and Matrix and PeerTube.

35:42.300 --> 35:45.420
Like it's just, object storage is the best.

35:45.420 --> 35:47.580
And Linode has a fantastic super fast

35:47.580 --> 35:49.460
S3 compatible implementation.

35:49.460 --> 35:53.380
And with pricing 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers

35:53.380 --> 35:55.500
that wanna lock you into their crazy clouds,

35:55.500 --> 35:56.500
it just makes so much sense,

35:56.500 --> 35:58.300
especially for us self-hosters.

35:58.300 --> 36:00.700
It's the type of system we want, you know what I mean?

36:00.700 --> 36:02.540
It's not like these weird dashboards

36:02.540 --> 36:03.860
where everything has its own unique name,

36:03.860 --> 36:05.300
it's their brand.

36:05.300 --> 36:07.260
It's a Linux box and you can get access to it

36:07.260 --> 36:08.940
and you can build the applications you need.

36:08.940 --> 36:11.020
One click style or from the ground up.

36:11.020 --> 36:12.980
It's all over there along with hundreds of guides,

36:12.980 --> 36:15.380
tutorials, and the best support in the business.

36:15.380 --> 36:17.740
That's why I love them and I think you will too.

36:17.740 --> 36:20.580
Go try them today, learn something, support the show,

36:20.580 --> 36:24.980
maybe deploy something, linode.com slash SSH.

36:24.980 --> 36:27.180
Go there to get that $100 and support the show.

36:27.180 --> 36:31.260
Once again, linode.com slash SSH.

36:32.740 --> 36:34.400
Well, I'm fresh back from London

36:34.400 --> 36:36.960
where I saw an awful lot of you lovely people.

36:36.960 --> 36:41.960
We did a bit of a recap in Linux Unplugged, episode 470.

36:42.580 --> 36:47.340
You can go and catch that over at linuxunplugged.com slash 470.

36:47.340 --> 36:49.860
There was about 75 people showed up.

36:49.860 --> 36:50.860
It was a pretty good turnout.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.920
Those that turned up got stickers,

36:52.920 --> 36:54.300
limited edition stickers.

36:54.300 --> 36:57.900
However, I had some leftover and so the wonderful Brent

36:57.900 --> 37:00.260
who's with me here this evening

37:00.260 --> 37:03.820
is gonna be transporting them across the continent.

37:03.820 --> 37:04.660
It's true.

37:04.660 --> 37:06.820
To the West Coast and handing them out

37:06.820 --> 37:10.020
like candy hopefully on the West Coast road trip

37:10.020 --> 37:10.860
that's coming up.

37:10.860 --> 37:12.580
Those are great stickers, so that's great.

37:12.580 --> 37:15.380
Do we know how many are left to give out?

37:15.380 --> 37:19.460
I think I've got two packs of 50 or 75 left.

37:19.460 --> 37:22.880
I can't remember exactly, but it's about 100.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.020
Sounds great.

37:24.020 --> 37:24.980
I wanna do something new

37:24.980 --> 37:27.600
on this West Coast road tour we're doing.

37:27.600 --> 37:30.180
I wanna just throughout the trip,

37:30.180 --> 37:33.540
four or five geocaches, I just wanna drop off and hide them

37:33.540 --> 37:35.620
and then leave hints on the show.

37:35.620 --> 37:37.660
So even locals who couldn't make it to a meetup,

37:37.660 --> 37:40.060
maybe they could go find the stuff we geocached somewhere.

37:40.060 --> 37:42.180
And of course, it'd be like a Tupperware container

37:42.180 --> 37:44.440
full of swag, obviously.

37:44.440 --> 37:45.940
I think that'd be a lot of fun.

37:45.940 --> 37:47.040
That might be something we do

37:47.040 --> 37:49.460
along our West Coast meetup road tour,

37:49.460 --> 37:52.580
which is coming up, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

37:52.580 --> 37:53.660
We'll be giving out swag.

37:53.660 --> 37:57.000
We have four or five, I don't know, meetups planned,

37:57.000 --> 38:00.660
including one at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

38:00.660 --> 38:03.060
We're gonna get a meetup around that area as well.

38:03.060 --> 38:05.180
So if you can't make it to JPL,

38:05.180 --> 38:07.260
not everybody will because it's a small crowd.

38:07.260 --> 38:08.660
We'll still have a meetup in that area though,

38:08.660 --> 38:09.700
so you can come hang out with us.

38:09.700 --> 38:12.700
All the details are at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

38:12.700 --> 38:16.180
We haven't talked too much about the JPL stuff in this show

38:16.180 --> 38:18.440
because it was mostly a Linux Unplugged venture,

38:18.440 --> 38:19.520
I think to start with,

38:19.520 --> 38:23.480
but the head of the Mars Copter project,

38:23.480 --> 38:26.820
I think his brother listened to Linux Unplugged

38:26.820 --> 38:31.420
and put this gentleman in touch with you, Chris,

38:31.420 --> 38:32.460
and reached out and said,

38:32.460 --> 38:37.340
hey, I'm the head of the Linux aspect of the Mars Copter.

38:37.340 --> 38:40.420
Like, do you wanna come see my workplace?

38:40.420 --> 38:41.900
And we're like, yes, we do.

38:41.900 --> 38:42.740
Yes, please.

38:42.740 --> 38:47.220
Yeah, and they have tours that they set up for the public.

38:47.220 --> 38:48.580
I mean, anybody can go.

38:48.580 --> 38:51.220
And those are limited to a certain amount of people.

38:51.220 --> 38:54.620
So we figured, okay, we'll do kind of a

38:54.620 --> 38:56.220
throw your name in the hat sort of thing.

38:56.220 --> 38:58.460
And then Wes is gonna write us a little Python script

38:58.460 --> 39:00.940
that we'll go through, randomize everybody's names

39:00.940 --> 39:02.440
and create a list.

39:02.440 --> 39:03.780
And then we'll also create a backup list.

39:03.780 --> 39:05.820
So it's worth putting your name in the hat.

39:05.820 --> 39:08.260
Jeez, I hope I win.

39:08.260 --> 39:09.740
Yeah, you're in, don't worry.

39:09.740 --> 39:10.900
You're in.

39:10.900 --> 39:12.300
I don't know about that Brent guy though.

39:12.300 --> 39:13.140
We'll see.

39:13.140 --> 39:14.620
Yeah, yeah, loose cannon over there.

39:14.620 --> 39:17.380
Yeah, he better go to selfhosted.show slash JPL

39:17.380 --> 39:18.380
to get his name in the hat.

39:18.380 --> 39:19.220
I'm gone.

39:19.220 --> 39:20.380
But yeah, that's the next thought instance

39:20.380 --> 39:22.300
that we're hosting just for this kind of stuff.

39:22.300 --> 39:24.620
Now we are planning some extra meetups

39:24.620 --> 39:28.300
in Pasadena, LA sort of area around the time of the tour.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.700
So even if you aren't part of the lucky 15

39:30.700 --> 39:33.500
and get to go around the chocolate factory,

39:33.500 --> 39:34.940
please do still come out and see us

39:34.940 --> 39:36.780
because Brent and I had a blast last night

39:36.780 --> 39:38.620
playing trivia in a local bar.

39:38.620 --> 39:42.960
And I think it's rekindled my love of that stuff.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.980
And we might try and do, I don't know,

39:44.980 --> 39:47.060
some Linux trivia or self-hosting trivia

39:47.060 --> 39:49.660
or something like that for the audience.

39:49.660 --> 39:50.700
So keep an eye out on that,

39:50.700 --> 39:52.580
keep an eye out on the meetups page.

39:52.580 --> 39:54.460
And I'll tell you what, after London,

39:54.460 --> 39:57.120
I'm meeting so many listeners and things like that,

39:57.120 --> 39:58.540
that there were people there,

39:58.540 --> 40:00.820
there was a guy that used to work at the Apple store

40:00.820 --> 40:02.500
and he talked to me a little bit about Apple

40:02.500 --> 40:03.460
because he's listened to the show

40:03.460 --> 40:06.540
and knows that my history used to be a genius

40:06.540 --> 40:07.420
on the Genius Bar.

40:07.420 --> 40:08.540
And there was another guy there

40:08.540 --> 40:11.740
who did the soundtrack like audio engineering

40:11.740 --> 40:13.760
for the Forza Motorsport games

40:13.760 --> 40:18.140
and just loads of super cool people

40:18.140 --> 40:20.820
that I would never ever have gotten the chance to meet

40:20.820 --> 40:23.140
without talking into this microphone,

40:23.140 --> 40:25.860
which is just, as I said in Linux Unplugged,

40:25.860 --> 40:28.780
I sit in this room talking to a screen effectively

40:28.780 --> 40:31.660
and it feels a little disconnected from the real world.

40:31.660 --> 40:33.100
But the meetups we've done this year

40:33.100 --> 40:37.020
have really reminded me that you never know who's listening.

40:37.020 --> 40:40.860
And the people listening are really interesting.

40:40.860 --> 40:42.100
They're people, they're like,

40:42.100 --> 40:43.540
they're actual people. They're all interesting,

40:43.540 --> 40:44.740
that's right. Yeah.

40:44.740 --> 40:46.700
Yeah, and that is always really good for me

40:46.700 --> 40:47.900
to kind of reconnect with.

40:47.900 --> 40:49.420
And I think we've been missing that

40:49.420 --> 40:50.420
for the last couple of years

40:50.420 --> 40:52.540
and that's kind of the reason why we're so excited

40:52.540 --> 40:53.380
about these meetups.

40:53.380 --> 40:54.900
And if you do have the opportunity,

40:54.900 --> 40:56.980
I think they're medically necessary.

40:56.980 --> 40:59.780
That's my, I'm a doctor, I'm a podcast doctor

40:59.780 --> 41:01.020
and that's my medical advice.

41:01.020 --> 41:06.020
So we also have a matrix space

41:06.340 --> 41:08.420
for all these different areas that we have meetups in.

41:08.420 --> 41:09.260
So you might check that out.

41:09.260 --> 41:10.180
We'll have a link in the show notes

41:10.180 --> 41:12.740
and specifically we have a West Coast crew,

41:12.740 --> 41:16.340
bit.ly slash West Coast crew,

41:16.340 --> 41:17.620
where we're chatting with locals.

41:17.620 --> 41:20.020
We're talking about details for these meetups.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.180
My wife, myself, Brantley, we're all in there

41:22.180 --> 41:24.620
kind of coordinating on stuff for this road trip.

41:24.620 --> 41:26.700
So check that out as well if you're in the area.

41:26.700 --> 41:29.260
Brent has bullied me into getting Elements set up now.

41:29.260 --> 41:30.820
So I'm in there too, I did.

41:30.820 --> 41:33.140
I know, that's big.

41:33.140 --> 41:34.060
That's awesome.

41:34.060 --> 41:36.100
Congratulations, welcome into the matrix.

41:36.100 --> 41:37.820
It's the beginning of the end of Discord.

41:37.820 --> 41:39.300
No, I don't know about that.

41:39.300 --> 41:40.180
I don't know about that,

41:40.180 --> 41:44.980
but I'm part of the self-hosting chat revolution at last.

41:44.980 --> 41:46.540
Woo.

41:46.540 --> 41:48.860
All right, speaking of self-hosting and feedback,

41:48.860 --> 41:50.100
we have some boost to get into.

41:50.100 --> 41:51.260
And I wanna say thank you to everybody

41:51.260 --> 41:52.820
who does boost into the show.

41:52.820 --> 41:53.980
We read them all.

41:53.980 --> 41:56.940
And we share them around internally very often

41:56.940 --> 41:58.340
and talk about them.

41:58.340 --> 42:01.220
But we also, we wanna keep this segment tight and moving

42:01.220 --> 42:03.220
because this show is only twice a month

42:03.220 --> 42:05.860
and we don't have a long time in each episode.

42:05.860 --> 42:08.620
So what we are doing, and it's a good problem to have,

42:08.620 --> 42:11.060
but we are setting a 2,000 sat limit

42:11.060 --> 42:13.660
to get your boost read on air.

42:13.660 --> 42:15.180
Now, every now that we might pull one forward

42:15.180 --> 42:17.420
that was less than that, because we do read them all,

42:17.420 --> 42:19.220
but we wanna keep this tight.

42:19.220 --> 42:20.100
We wanna keep it moving.

42:20.100 --> 42:22.660
So we're gonna set it at that limit for now.

42:22.660 --> 42:24.140
This is kind of all still an experiment.

42:24.140 --> 42:26.940
So thank you, everybody who works with us as we do this.

42:26.940 --> 42:29.380
And we appreciate all the support that's been sent in.

42:29.380 --> 42:32.180
And we're gonna start with a make good boost this week.

42:32.180 --> 42:35.020
It was accidentally sent into the wrong show first.

42:35.020 --> 42:36.300
And then it was my bad

42:36.300 --> 42:38.180
because we had a whole bunch of schedule changes

42:38.180 --> 42:40.460
with travel and whatnot, and I didn't get into the show.

42:40.460 --> 42:45.460
So CB sent us in a whopping 82,997 sats.

42:46.780 --> 42:48.380
Is that a baller boost?

42:48.380 --> 42:50.020
That's definitely a baller boost.

42:50.020 --> 42:53.500
That's a back home baller for sure.

42:53.500 --> 42:56.020
And CB writes, I just listed a self-hosted 74

42:56.020 --> 42:59.020
and I cannot agree more with the Home Assistant platforms

42:59.020 --> 43:00.700
going downhill in quality.

43:00.700 --> 43:03.500
We use Google Home Minis and we're at the point

43:03.500 --> 43:07.540
where all we use it for is like lazily checking the time.

43:07.540 --> 43:10.340
It's almost useless for anything else now.

43:10.340 --> 43:11.380
Here's an example.

43:11.380 --> 43:14.500
If my wife says, okay, Googs, make a new shopping list

43:14.500 --> 43:16.420
called our son's favorite toys.

43:16.420 --> 43:20.180
It'll say, okay, making a list called our son's

43:20.180 --> 43:21.500
favorite music.

43:21.500 --> 43:23.100
I wanna pause here and say,

43:23.100 --> 43:25.980
I have the ultimate what the F moment.

43:25.980 --> 43:29.900
I asked the Siri tube what the weather is.

43:29.900 --> 43:33.860
And her response was, I can't find that right now,

43:33.860 --> 43:36.060
but I've sent more information to your phone.

43:37.300 --> 43:38.500
Like what?

43:38.500 --> 43:39.860
And so then I asked her again, I'm like,

43:39.860 --> 43:41.780
that must've been like a connectivity error.

43:41.780 --> 43:43.460
So then I asked her what the time is, right?

43:43.460 --> 43:45.220
And she tells me what the time is.

43:45.220 --> 43:48.900
So then I say, you know, hey Siri,

43:48.900 --> 43:50.780
what's the weather tomorrow?

43:50.780 --> 43:52.220
And then she comes back,

43:52.220 --> 43:53.620
she's listening to me of course.

43:53.620 --> 43:57.340
And then she comes back and says,

43:57.340 --> 43:59.340
some error about personality settings

43:59.340 --> 44:00.860
and to check my phone.

44:00.860 --> 44:04.860
And so now I cannot use her for basically anything.

44:04.860 --> 44:07.500
It has continued to get worse.

44:07.500 --> 44:09.540
Initially it was just stuff I could control

44:09.540 --> 44:10.420
with Home Assistant.

44:10.420 --> 44:12.700
That was what I lost completely.

44:12.700 --> 44:16.140
But now it's even the basics like the weather

44:16.140 --> 44:19.380
or like mileage, anything like that.

44:19.380 --> 44:21.260
She's just completely missing it all now.

44:21.260 --> 44:24.740
We're in trouble when the tubes get sick of your S, huh?

44:24.740 --> 44:26.380
Yeah, maybe she's messing with me.

44:26.380 --> 44:28.180
She's gaslighting me.

44:28.180 --> 44:30.380
My favorite feature of these tubes at the moment

44:30.380 --> 44:34.300
is the, by the way, did you know that you can...

44:34.300 --> 44:36.420
Yeah, okay, shut up, please.

44:36.420 --> 44:38.620
I asked you for a three word answer

44:38.620 --> 44:41.260
and I have a 45 second by the way clip

44:41.260 --> 44:44.540
that tells me all things, shut up.

44:44.540 --> 44:47.580
I think the Echo must have like a minimum

44:47.580 --> 44:50.900
they try to get in because I use the Echo so rarely.

44:50.900 --> 44:53.300
It's literally every single time I use it,

44:53.300 --> 44:55.300
it gives me a by the way.

44:55.300 --> 44:57.180
I use it like maybe four times a week at most

44:57.180 --> 44:59.380
and every single time I get a by the way.

44:59.380 --> 45:00.740
I can't even with this anymore.

45:00.740 --> 45:02.060
I'm so sick of it.

45:02.060 --> 45:03.500
So CB gave us a double boost

45:03.500 --> 45:06.440
by continuing with some leak stats saying,

45:06.440 --> 45:08.200
maybe that Google employee was right.

45:08.200 --> 45:10.540
These AIs are becoming sentient

45:10.540 --> 45:12.260
and giving us terrible quality results

45:12.260 --> 45:13.680
in the form of a revolt.

45:15.500 --> 45:17.140
Love all the shows, thank you.

45:17.140 --> 45:19.820
It may be, I don't know what's going on.

45:19.820 --> 45:22.440
What's weird is the Siri on the phone's still fine.

45:22.440 --> 45:24.060
It's just the Siri in the HomePods

45:24.060 --> 45:25.780
that's totally lost its mind.

45:25.780 --> 45:28.860
Alex caught me using one of the Google Home devices

45:28.860 --> 45:29.700
in a novel way.

45:29.700 --> 45:31.300
Alex, care to tell the story?

45:31.300 --> 45:33.300
I caught Brent with a Google Home

45:33.300 --> 45:35.100
strapped to a battery bank

45:35.100 --> 45:37.500
with a little power device in there.

45:37.500 --> 45:40.980
And I'm actually curious, is it just Bluetooth audio?

45:40.980 --> 45:43.420
Yeah, I've been using it as a Bluetooth speaker

45:43.420 --> 45:44.940
and turned the microphone off

45:44.940 --> 45:47.180
because I don't want all that interruption.

45:47.180 --> 45:49.460
Which it moans about every time you turn it on.

45:49.460 --> 45:50.600
It's true, by the way.

45:50.600 --> 45:53.560
By the way, did you know you could turn the microphone on?

45:54.620 --> 45:56.820
I turned it off by on purpose.

45:56.820 --> 45:57.940
Right.

45:57.940 --> 45:59.700
And it's actually been great.

45:59.700 --> 46:01.540
I've been carrying that thing around

46:01.540 --> 46:03.140
as I do little projects here and there

46:03.140 --> 46:03.980
all over the house.

46:03.980 --> 46:05.100
It's been fabulous.

46:05.100 --> 46:08.740
So I don't know, it doesn't even need internet connectivity.

46:08.740 --> 46:12.460
They do sell little cradles that you can pop them into

46:12.460 --> 46:14.100
that are basically USB batteries

46:14.100 --> 46:17.020
that are mounts for those things to make them portable.

46:17.020 --> 46:20.860
Okay, now here's a couple of our last sub-2000 SATs boosts,

46:20.860 --> 46:23.180
logic boosts to do with some LeetSats.

46:23.180 --> 46:24.980
I think he's asking you this, Alex.

46:26.140 --> 46:29.260
He'd like to hear your take on Pi Hall or AdGuard.

46:29.260 --> 46:31.700
He'd like to also hear about your three different locations

46:31.700 --> 46:34.580
you're using it because he's been looking at Pi Hall

46:34.580 --> 46:37.660
synced up using gravity sync over tail scale

46:37.660 --> 46:38.980
or something like that.

46:38.980 --> 46:41.560
And he thinks he can get some redundancy with this setup.

46:41.560 --> 46:45.540
And I think he's just, I personally think

46:45.540 --> 46:48.340
he's trying to be convinced to look at AdGuard.

46:48.340 --> 46:51.500
So I read this, each Pi Hall synced up,

46:51.500 --> 46:53.040
like you said, using gravity.

46:54.300 --> 46:55.620
Why?

46:55.620 --> 46:58.080
I don't know what benefit that adds.

46:58.080 --> 47:00.380
I mean, I'll just say this,

47:00.380 --> 47:04.620
like I set up the AdGuard home instance on my firewall

47:04.620 --> 47:08.940
on OpenSense here two, three years ago,

47:08.940 --> 47:10.880
and the lists automatically update

47:10.880 --> 47:12.520
and the version automatically updates.

47:12.520 --> 47:15.880
And that really is the last bit of thought I gave to it.

47:16.860 --> 47:18.780
These lists update remotely.

47:18.780 --> 47:22.540
They are published by third parties.

47:22.540 --> 47:24.260
I'm not really involved in that process.

47:24.260 --> 47:27.300
I mean, I suppose there is some kind of a security risk

47:27.300 --> 47:31.340
potentially with people spoofing DNS entries that way

47:31.340 --> 47:33.900
or what have you, but yeah,

47:33.900 --> 47:36.420
I suppose that's the risky take, isn't it?

47:36.420 --> 47:38.460
So I would just say,

47:38.460 --> 47:40.900
I don't really worry about syncing my DNS

47:40.900 --> 47:41.900
between three sites.

47:41.900 --> 47:45.300
And I certainly don't worry about redundancy of DNS locally

47:45.300 --> 47:48.300
because the setup's pretty simple.

47:48.300 --> 47:52.580
Like if the firewall is out, then the internet is out

47:52.580 --> 47:54.640
and obviously my DNS with it.

47:54.640 --> 47:57.560
So if the DNS service crashes,

47:57.560 --> 48:00.420
then I'm gonna notice that pretty quickly

48:00.420 --> 48:03.040
and I can just go in and fix that if I need to.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.580
But again, if DNS locally is down,

48:05.580 --> 48:09.860
unless I've got some kind of IP only route

48:09.860 --> 48:14.020
to my other sites, then it's always DNS.

48:14.020 --> 48:17.740
So it's a bit of a chicken and egg problem.

48:17.740 --> 48:21.140
And I just like to keep things simple as possible really

48:21.140 --> 48:23.740
just by having everything local to each site.

48:23.740 --> 48:26.820
And then that way, if something goes down on that site,

48:26.820 --> 48:28.220
it's compartmentalized.

48:28.220 --> 48:29.620
The failure is compartmentalized.

48:29.620 --> 48:32.980
The blast radius is reduced to just my house

48:32.980 --> 48:34.220
or just my mom's house or whatever.

48:34.220 --> 48:36.940
And there's the performance element of it too, really.

48:36.940 --> 48:40.740
You know, that's probably one of the top three reasons

48:40.740 --> 48:44.580
I run a DNS server on my LAN is I don't wanna send

48:44.580 --> 48:46.500
my DNS requests all the way out to my ISP.

48:46.500 --> 48:49.580
That's tens of milliseconds.

48:49.580 --> 48:50.420
What's that?

48:50.420 --> 48:52.060
And obviously the same argument applies

48:52.060 --> 48:54.260
to like Kubernetes and all that kind of stuff.

48:54.260 --> 48:58.980
Like, yes, I could run the Wiki in my house

48:58.980 --> 49:01.300
on a Kubernetes cluster and have it highly available

49:01.300 --> 49:04.540
and redundant and have a pie on different UPSs

49:04.540 --> 49:06.420
at different ends of the house and stuff like that.

49:06.420 --> 49:09.400
But that's a lot of work, isn't it?

49:09.400 --> 49:10.240
Let's be fair.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.300
Let's be honest.

49:11.300 --> 49:12.220
A little too far.

49:12.220 --> 49:13.540
A little too far.

49:13.540 --> 49:14.700
Yeah, yeah.

49:14.700 --> 49:17.880
I asked last week just to get people's general

49:17.880 --> 49:20.800
kind of temperature on OpenSense versus BFSense

49:20.800 --> 49:24.660
and 412 Linux with 1010SATS boosted in said,

49:24.660 --> 49:26.980
hi gents, regarding OpenSense.

49:26.980 --> 49:29.980
I've been running OpenSense on a ProtekcTLiVault.

49:33.040 --> 49:33.980
Not familiar with that.

49:33.980 --> 49:35.380
Precisely.

49:35.380 --> 49:36.220
Okay.

49:36.220 --> 49:37.860
You've been doing it for about two years,

49:37.860 --> 49:40.160
completed about a dozen minor upgrades,

49:40.160 --> 49:43.200
maybe two major upgrades and each has proceeded

49:43.200 --> 49:44.740
without issue.

49:44.740 --> 49:48.500
I just completed the upgrade to 22.7, added AdGuard

49:48.500 --> 49:50.620
and I've been very happy with the quality

49:50.620 --> 49:51.840
of the release.

49:52.980 --> 49:54.180
All right.

49:54.180 --> 49:55.060
All right.

49:55.060 --> 49:57.340
I'm gonna have to start a campaign with Wes Payne though

49:57.340 --> 50:01.280
because he was very set on building a bare bones Linux box

50:01.280 --> 50:03.260
for the studio to do the firewall.

50:03.260 --> 50:05.100
Well, this is pretty interesting actually

50:05.100 --> 50:08.600
because just this week I switched the subnet

50:08.600 --> 50:13.600
of my local house from 192.168.16 something

50:13.600 --> 50:18.600
to 10.something subnet because my remote family members,

50:20.700 --> 50:24.500
as I talked about in the last episode, have Starlink,

50:24.500 --> 50:29.500
have SkyRouters, you know, BT, all in the UK.

50:29.780 --> 50:33.500
And a lot of these routers don't give you the option

50:33.500 --> 50:36.540
to customize even the DHCP range.

50:36.540 --> 50:41.540
And so a lot of them pick 192.168.0 or 168.1.

50:41.540 --> 50:43.740
And I actually had that in my local range here

50:43.740 --> 50:46.220
because I thought, oh, well, arrogantly,

50:46.220 --> 50:47.900
like I'm gonna be able to take control

50:47.900 --> 50:50.540
of all these remote networks and change them to.16

50:50.540 --> 50:53.660
or whatever, you know, to get around that.

50:53.660 --> 50:55.740
And it turned out actually that more often than not,

50:55.740 --> 50:58.860
when I'm remote, I don't have control over the network

50:58.860 --> 51:02.500
and I have to deal with being on a subnet that overlaps

51:02.500 --> 51:04.500
with my local subnet here.

51:04.500 --> 51:08.500
And so by switching my subnet here to a different,

51:08.500 --> 51:11.980
you know, totally different cider,

51:11.980 --> 51:15.260
I've been able to, I hope, I'll test this out

51:15.260 --> 51:18.340
over the next year or two, I guess, circumvent that issue.

51:18.340 --> 51:20.700
Now I'm using tail scale everywhere.

51:20.700 --> 51:22.340
Otherwise tail scale just goes, well,

51:22.340 --> 51:24.140
there's two subnets here that are the same.

51:24.140 --> 51:25.620
I have no idea what to do with this traffic,

51:25.620 --> 51:26.940
so I'll just do nothing.

51:26.940 --> 51:28.820
I'll just do nothing with it.

51:28.820 --> 51:31.260
So coming to your point about OpenSense,

51:31.260 --> 51:34.020
the reason I mention it is because I was actually

51:34.020 --> 51:38.220
considering trying out something other than OpenSense

51:38.220 --> 51:41.900
so maybe via iOS, if you have any experience with that,

51:41.900 --> 51:44.340
I'd be really curious to hear that in the chat

51:44.340 --> 51:47.260
or via the contact forms,

51:47.260 --> 51:51.780
or just creating a bog standard Linux VM

51:51.780 --> 51:53.820
with IP tables or whatever,

51:53.820 --> 51:56.660
and just create the firewall rules that way myself

51:56.660 --> 52:00.580
because I'm getting a bit tired.

52:00.580 --> 52:01.820
It's only a small annoyance,

52:01.820 --> 52:04.340
but it's all the DHCP requests, right?

52:04.340 --> 52:07.140
The static leases that I've had to configure this week.

52:07.140 --> 52:09.820
Of clicking through the UI and not having things

52:09.820 --> 52:14.820
in an Ansible-ized infrastructure as code fashion.

52:14.820 --> 52:16.620
I would like to be able to just apply my config,

52:16.620 --> 52:19.780
have DNS mask and all that just taken care of,

52:19.780 --> 52:22.500
and then never think about it ever again.

52:22.500 --> 52:23.540
I'm so glad you touched on this

52:23.540 --> 52:25.700
because this was gonna be where I go with this,

52:25.700 --> 52:28.020
is it does seem like the kind of approach

52:28.020 --> 52:30.740
Wes wanted to go with would be better

52:30.740 --> 52:32.780
from an Ansible management standpoint.

52:32.780 --> 52:34.780
Wow, you just dropped a lot on me.

52:34.780 --> 52:36.380
So while I'm thinking, while I'm thinking

52:36.380 --> 52:39.620
while I'm starting to kind of give to the OpenSense idea,

52:39.620 --> 52:41.780
you're coming around to what I was talking about

52:41.780 --> 52:43.620
and we just passed each other in the night.

52:43.620 --> 52:45.300
I can't even like, oh,

52:45.300 --> 52:46.860
there's a lot of night passing happening here.

52:46.860 --> 52:49.020
I mean, you did just discover Shelly

52:49.020 --> 52:50.740
about two or three years late, so.

52:50.740 --> 52:51.580
Yeah, I know.

52:51.580 --> 52:54.340
That's fair, that's fair.

52:54.340 --> 52:56.500
It took you about two years of talking about it

52:56.500 --> 52:57.380
before I tried one.

52:57.380 --> 53:00.380
So how long have I been running PFSense slash OpenSense?

53:00.380 --> 53:04.940
It must be, it must be getting on for a decade, honestly.

53:04.940 --> 53:07.140
You know, I know the ins and outs of that thing.

53:07.140 --> 53:10.900
It's a very well known battle tested quantity.

53:12.020 --> 53:14.860
If I switch my firewall to something other than that,

53:14.860 --> 53:16.820
then I become responsible for it.

53:16.820 --> 53:19.420
And, you know, at the moment it's an appliance.

53:19.420 --> 53:21.460
If, you know, whilst Brent was here, it broke,

53:21.460 --> 53:24.700
I'd say go downstairs, unplug it and re-plug it in.

53:24.700 --> 53:27.620
And it would just reboot and be fine most likely.

53:27.620 --> 53:29.100
So who knows?

53:29.100 --> 53:30.780
I'm not sure quite what I'm gonna do yet.

53:30.780 --> 53:32.500
I don't know if I'll go to a halfway house

53:32.500 --> 53:36.340
and just move DNS mask type services onto a dedicated pie

53:36.340 --> 53:39.180
in the rack or something, and then leave OpenSense alone.

53:39.180 --> 53:40.940
That's an option.

53:40.940 --> 53:43.900
But I am a fan of having DHCP on the firewall

53:43.900 --> 53:47.660
because it just seems the logical place to put it, you know.

53:47.660 --> 53:49.780
And I like putting DNS and DHCP together.

53:49.780 --> 53:52.780
Yes, sorry, co-locate those two, absolutely.

53:52.780 --> 53:54.420
Well, I'd also like to know what the audience thinks.

53:54.420 --> 53:55.900
Send us in a boost with your ideas.

53:55.900 --> 54:00.900
Pleb 3000 sent us in a row of ducks, 2222 SATs

54:00.900 --> 54:02.740
for passing on secrets after I die.

54:02.740 --> 54:04.500
Also a question that came up last week,

54:04.500 --> 54:06.220
comes up every now and then, actually.

54:06.220 --> 54:09.460
I just use Bitwarden's emergency contact feature

54:09.460 --> 54:13.100
with an encrypted USB I give my contact in advance,

54:13.100 --> 54:14.540
and I call it a day.

54:14.540 --> 54:17.660
On the bright side, if your Bitcoin fails to get passed on,

54:17.660 --> 54:18.940
then essentially that's a donation

54:18.940 --> 54:20.940
to the Bitcoin community.

54:20.940 --> 54:22.060
That's true.

54:22.060 --> 54:24.620
Everybody's value goes up, I suppose.

54:24.620 --> 54:25.780
Not lately.

54:25.780 --> 54:30.780
Well, no, what he means is there's been less Bitcoins.

54:30.900 --> 54:33.980
Yeah, right.

54:33.980 --> 54:37.420
Jason boosts in with 2827 SATs,

54:37.420 --> 54:40.620
plus one for Alex's RJ45 ends with the wires

54:40.620 --> 54:42.380
that pass through.

54:42.380 --> 54:43.620
They cost a little more.

54:43.620 --> 54:46.500
Oh, and you have to get yourself a new crimping tool

54:46.500 --> 54:50.460
or cut the wires with scissors, but it's totally worth it.

54:50.460 --> 54:53.660
It's way better than the classic style, I agree.

54:53.660 --> 54:55.860
Yeah, totally, totally worth it.

54:55.860 --> 54:58.340
Thank you, everybody, who boosted in under 2000 SATs.

54:58.340 --> 54:59.540
We did read your message.

54:59.540 --> 55:02.260
Some of you I followed up with on Matrix,

55:02.260 --> 55:04.740
and thank you for being flexible while we try this out.

55:04.740 --> 55:08.660
If you want to grab a podcast app that supports Boost,

55:08.660 --> 55:12.980
newpodcastapps.com, or be a nerd and used Boost CLI

55:12.980 --> 55:14.420
and Boost from the command line.

55:14.420 --> 55:16.540
All right, well, Brentley, are you gonna be with us

55:16.540 --> 55:18.740
for the next episode, or are you probably outta here by then?

55:18.740 --> 55:20.900
I am, but am I gonna be with you by then?

55:20.900 --> 55:24.220
Maybe the one after that, maybe the one after that.

55:24.220 --> 55:26.580
Yeah, you gotta go home for a little bit, don't you?

55:26.580 --> 55:28.540
I guess I have cats at home somewhere.

55:28.540 --> 55:31.140
Eventually, Border Patrol will come looking for you.

55:31.140 --> 55:34.260
When will he realize that van life is the way?

55:34.260 --> 55:36.340
I know, you know what?

55:36.340 --> 55:38.380
The audience emails me that and asks,

55:38.380 --> 55:39.940
when's Brent gonna figure it out?

55:39.940 --> 55:43.060
Just email me a van and I'll do it.

55:43.060 --> 55:44.300
3D print it while you're at Alex's, right?

55:44.300 --> 55:46.500
I've even offered him use of my workshop here

55:46.500 --> 55:47.780
to kit the damn thing out.

55:47.780 --> 55:51.020
It's true, but it's filled with gulfs now.

55:51.020 --> 55:51.860
It is, it's true.

55:51.860 --> 55:52.940
Yeah, what are you gonna do there?

55:52.940 --> 55:54.500
I think he really needs a short bus.

55:54.500 --> 55:56.140
I mean, you know, seriously, a little short bus,

55:56.140 --> 55:56.980
diesel, or something like that.

55:56.980 --> 55:59.660
You just want me to live the life you want.

55:59.660 --> 56:00.500
That's right.

56:00.500 --> 56:01.500
No, I wanna vicariously-

56:01.500 --> 56:03.420
You are squandering, and this, I'm sorry,

56:03.420 --> 56:05.260
I'm gonna get in my soapbox for a second.

56:05.260 --> 56:08.500
You are squandering the single life right now.

56:08.500 --> 56:10.500
Chris and I are sat over here looking at you

56:10.500 --> 56:14.540
with the kid factor, thinking, if only.

56:14.540 --> 56:18.220
If only we didn't have the responsibilities of that fam,

56:18.220 --> 56:20.100
which we love very much.

56:20.100 --> 56:21.100
We'd be on the road.

56:21.100 --> 56:23.540
Well, let's nurse right in with your single Brent advice

56:23.540 --> 56:24.900
and I'll consider it.

56:24.900 --> 56:28.540
And you can always tell him in person too.

56:28.540 --> 56:31.300
He'll be at the JPL and the meetups.

56:31.300 --> 56:33.380
Go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting

56:33.380 --> 56:34.820
for more deets on that.

56:34.820 --> 56:36.340
And thank you to our members,

56:36.340 --> 56:37.860
our site reliability engineers.

56:37.860 --> 56:39.460
You guys make the show possible.

56:39.460 --> 56:41.580
You give us the runway to negotiate with the sponsors

56:41.580 --> 56:43.580
we wanna talk to, and as a thank you,

56:43.580 --> 56:45.460
we have an ad free feed for CHU

56:45.460 --> 56:46.980
with a post-show attached to that

56:46.980 --> 56:50.380
with more features coming at the end of the year.

56:50.380 --> 56:51.900
So to become a member, support the show

56:51.900 --> 56:56.900
and keep us going, selfhosted.show slash S-R-E.

56:57.180 --> 56:59.340
That was a long slash.

56:59.340 --> 57:00.740
It's just one slash.

57:00.740 --> 57:02.260
I really want them to know

57:02.260 --> 57:03.500
they have to put a slash in there.

57:03.500 --> 57:06.500
It won't work if they just do selfhosted.show S-R-E.

57:06.500 --> 57:08.340
You gotta have the slash in there.

57:08.340 --> 57:10.020
You gotta have the slash.

57:10.020 --> 57:12.460
Now, I just wanna underscore how grateful I am

57:12.460 --> 57:15.300
to all of you that didn't already hear my thanks

57:15.300 --> 57:19.580
in Living's Unplugged, that you came to the meetups.

57:19.580 --> 57:21.860
Not only the London one, the micro rally one

57:21.860 --> 57:24.340
that we had as well, where four or five people showed up.

57:24.340 --> 57:26.140
That was pretty nice.

57:26.140 --> 57:27.860
It's really energizing, those kinds of things.

57:27.860 --> 57:30.420
I know we keep talking about meetups lately on the network,

57:30.420 --> 57:31.820
but I think with everything that's happened

57:31.820 --> 57:33.900
in the last two or three years,

57:33.900 --> 57:35.060
we have to get out again.

57:35.060 --> 57:37.060
We have to get out of our caves and go and see each other

57:37.060 --> 57:39.300
and actually have real life conversations

57:39.300 --> 57:41.540
because there were topics that came up.

57:41.540 --> 57:43.780
Would you believe we actually had a rational conversation

57:43.780 --> 57:46.300
about snaps at the London meetup?

57:46.300 --> 57:48.180
Isn't that interesting how these things come up

57:48.180 --> 57:50.540
and everybody just has real human conversations.

57:50.540 --> 57:51.500
Nobody gets upset.

57:51.500 --> 57:53.100
Absolutely, there was no mudslinging.

57:53.100 --> 57:54.500
It was just, I think it's stupid.

57:54.500 --> 57:56.700
Okay, cool, why do you think it's stupid?

57:56.700 --> 57:58.420
Rather than, oh, you're an idiot.

57:58.420 --> 57:59.740
No, you know, like you would be on real estate.

57:59.740 --> 58:01.300
No, you're an idiot.

58:01.300 --> 58:03.500
I know that, but you know.

58:03.500 --> 58:06.580
Anyway, my point is if you can possibly make the effort

58:06.580 --> 58:09.420
to come out to the West Coast and see us all, please do.

58:09.420 --> 58:10.820
We'd love to see you.

58:10.820 --> 58:12.420
Until then, let's hear from you

58:12.420 --> 58:14.860
at selfhosted.show slash contact.

58:14.860 --> 58:17.100
And if you have anything else, any other feedback

58:17.100 --> 58:17.940
or anything like that,

58:17.940 --> 58:20.540
you can find me on Twitter at ironicbadger.

58:20.540 --> 58:22.540
I'm over there at Chris LAS.

58:22.540 --> 58:24.140
And I'm at Brent Gervais.

58:24.140 --> 58:25.740
If you can spell it, you win a prize.

58:25.740 --> 58:29.420
If you know Ricky Gervais, you know, you might.

58:29.420 --> 58:30.420
He hates it when I say that.

58:30.420 --> 58:31.620
I'm sorry, Brent.

58:31.620 --> 58:35.020
The prize is you get Brent's stuff in your feed, by the way.

58:35.020 --> 58:37.660
Congratulations.

58:37.660 --> 58:39.700
The podcast is at self-hosted show

58:39.700 --> 58:42.700
and there is also a network one, you know,

58:42.700 --> 58:43.940
for like all the other shows that we do.

58:43.940 --> 58:45.660
There's a lot of other shows at Jupiter Signal.

58:45.660 --> 58:47.500
I don't know, figure it out.

58:47.500 --> 58:48.740
You figure it out, eh?

58:48.740 --> 58:50.380
You figure it out.

58:50.380 --> 58:51.660
Thanks for listening, everybody.

58:51.660 --> 59:10.660
That was selfhosted.show slash 77.
