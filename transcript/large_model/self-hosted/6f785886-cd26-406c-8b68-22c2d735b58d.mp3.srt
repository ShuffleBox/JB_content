1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
No Brent this week, he's finally left the building.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,080
That must feel a little like empty nest over there.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,600
Yeah, a little bit. We do miss our little baby Brent bird.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:16,480
Yeah, it's like having a pet Canadian around that, you know, cleans up after himself, makes food.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,280
Mostly, apart from his perennially dirty egg pan that's on the stove.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,640
Yeah, he'll have that and like a plate and a cup.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,920
It's impossible to explain to anybody that's never lived with a Brent.

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,840
But the guy eats constantly.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,360
This is his vegan lifestyle because he doesn't have any serious protein in him.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,800
But to his credit, and I think you'd agree with me, this bastard can make a meal out of anything.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,000
Like I'll look in the fridge and I'll be like, we've got nothing to eat.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,800
And Brent will look out there and go, oh, we've got three days worth of food in here.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,440
And he'll put a bunch of stuff together that you'd never think would work.

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,320
And it works. That's like his superpower.

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,720
In his honor today, I am drinking a beverage which is new to me.

16
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,520
This is the Canada dry ginger ale.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,800
It's actually very tasty.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,640
Maybe they know what they're doing up there.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,440
So I know while he was at your place, he was deep diving into Plex.

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,600
And he was also watching some content off of my Plex server while it was still up.

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,600
Kind of ironically, today, as we're starting the show, we look at the headlines and we see

22
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:25,520
Plex has suffered a massive compromise, exposing usernames, emails, and passwords.

23
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,360
And passwords, Alex.

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,960
Yeah, this is not a good look, is it?

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,320
For an app which is, well, was primarily designed for local media playback

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,720
to suffer a compromise like this, where they say that yesterday we discovered suspicious

27
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,360
activity on one of our databases.

28
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,080
We immediately began an investigation and it does appear that a third party was able

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,160
to access a limited subset of data.

30
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,640
That includes emails, usernames, and encrypted passwords.

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,520
Now, what I find interesting about this statement is that there are conflicting reports online

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,320
as to whether the passwords themselves were encrypted or whether they were just hashed

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,360
with assault.

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,400
I think you touched on it there.

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,200
I think why it stings so much is some of us have been using Plex and some of us have been

36
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,000
a lifetime subscriber for a very, very, very long time.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,360
And it didn't necessarily have all of these hooks into the online Plex back end.

38
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,400
In fact, I don't even recall it requiring logging into the Plex service to just access

39
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,760
my local Plex library.

40
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
I seem to recall that was something that came along later.

41
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,280
And so they've sort of built and baked in this stuff as time has gone on.

42
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:45,360
And it was something that initially started as kind of my off the radar stash of stuff.

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,160
And now it's sort of integrated in with this whole service.

44
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,560
And now my information's been leaked because, of course, my stuff's in there.

45
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,080
It really stings.

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,880
We know better.

47
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,160
And I think that's going to be the theme of this episode is that we know better.

48
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,120
These companies that store our data in the cloud, be it Plex, be it Google, as we will

49
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,920
touch on later.

50
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,920
At some point, that information is going to become public domain.

51
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,840
And I think no matter whether it's an encrypted library of some description of information,

52
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,360
like say, what's in your password manager, or whether it's a database of hashed password

53
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:29,760
salts, or whatever it may well be, at some point, it is fair to say that that information

54
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,160
will end up in the wrong hands somehow.

55
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,640
It's just a fact of life these days, unfortunately.

56
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,800
So all of this, and I think, again, this will be a theme of this episode, has me questioning

57
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:48,800
yet again, why I'm relying on a closed source application, which requires third party authentication

58
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,200
outside my LAN to watch a file, which is sat in my basement.

59
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,680
Jellyfin is the obvious choice.

60
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,840
But I wondered, do you have any opinions on, I don't want to say Plex versus Jellyfin,

61
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,680
but like the ecosystem of the two apps?

62
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,080
Yeah, this is going to be tricky, because maybe you and I, with our set top boxes, could

63
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,560
kind of make anything work.

64
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,360
But there's also like listeners out there who are using Plex because it's built into

65
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,560
their smart TV.

66
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,600
They've got an app for it.

67
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,080
And that is not necessarily the case with Jellyfin.

68
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,360
You can get it on Android, you can get it on Apple TV, you can get it on the Roku, a

69
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,080
Jellyfin app.

70
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,160
So I imagine you can also sideload it or get it maybe from the store directly on the fire

71
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,480
stick.

72
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,840
I haven't checked in forever.

73
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,560
But that's about it.

74
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,800
That's where it drops off, right?

75
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,280
And there's a lot of other devices out there.

76
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,480
That's tricky.

77
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,880
I know also I hear from the audience a lot, there's a UI, you know, a UI gap between

78
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,480
Jellyfin and Plex.

79
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,480
And I also will, I know we're going to hear from people that will say, but hey, you know,

80
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,200
Chris, hey, Alex, you could actually, for the most part, use Plex with only local network

81
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,320
authentication.

82
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,480
But here you hit the same issue you have with Jellyfin.

83
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,040
When you go with only local authentication with Plex, you break about 80% of the Plex

84
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,520
clients.

85
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,560
They just don't work.

86
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,160
And if you want to test, just disconnect your internet for an afternoon and see what devices

87
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,560
in your house will play Plex and which ones won't.

88
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,160
I think you'll be quite disappointed.

89
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,280
Yeah, not many.

90
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,280
And the thing is, like when I was on the plane coming back from England just last week, even

91
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:36,240
my iPad, which I had deliberately cached terabytes worth of media to an external drive, decided

92
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,080
when I loaded up the Plex app that it was going to sit there and spin for a minute or

93
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,840
two trying to connect, even though there was no network connection.

94
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,320
And I'm like, what are you doing?

95
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,640
I just want to play these local files.

96
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,840
Please let me in.

97
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,480
And it straws slowly one by one by one, breaking the camel's back here with Plex.

98
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:03,840
But I have a few apps that I rely on, I say rely, I use, okay, it's maybe not rely is

99
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,160
too strong of a word, but things like Tautuli.

100
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,600
And I don't know if I've said that name correctly, but essentially it's Plex server playback

101
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,280
stats application.

102
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,400
So it can track, you know, what my users have been watching when they played, paused and

103
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,760
stopped and started and whether they transcoded and all these useful things which I can look

104
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,920
back and trends and say, well, which shows, because nobody watched for three years, well,

105
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,200
I can go ahead and delete those.

106
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,640
That kind of thing.

107
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,760
Oh, that's an interesting idea.

108
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,600
I'd never thought about actually using it for cleaning up library items you're no longer

109
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,240
using.

110
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,200
Did you happen to check and just, I don't know, review what Brent binged while you were

111
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,440
gone?

112
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,720
I think he was on a Better Call Saul binge whilst I was gone.

113
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,960
Mostly because we were, which, by the way, I'm not going to spoil the ending, but it

114
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,000
was fantastic.

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,320
This is part of the ecosystem you're talking about, though.

116
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,680
Yeah, absolutely.

117
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,600
So Tautuli is one of them.

118
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,920
There's a new one this week, which I just came across.

119
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,920
I think you've been using it for a while from what you told me called Overseer.

120
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,640
Overseer is a class of application we don't talk a lot about on the show, sort of touching

121
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,320
the third rail, but it is the ultimate evolution of that type of application.

122
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:18,000
And these are those apps where you just say, hey, computer, I want this movie or this show

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,800
and it goes and gets it.

124
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,920
But this takes it to the next level in helping you discover stuff that's trending and popular

125
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,200
or well-rated.

126
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,280
And it wraps it all up with such a great UI.

127
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,800
That's what I absolutely love about it.

128
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,160
So the thing that really seals the deal is it has a full Plex library integration.

129
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,280
So if I'm saying to my family, well, let's say my mom was a big Elvis fan and that new

130
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,480
Elvis movie just came out.

131
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,440
She's like, could you add it to Plex for me?

132
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,880
And I'm like, well, I could, but you could do it yourself.

133
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,800
And then shared the link with her Three Tail Scale, which is awesome.

134
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,600
So there's nothing exposed on the internet, but it has a library integration with Plex.

135
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,720
And so if I already had that movie in my library and she went to go and request it, for example,

136
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,320
it would say, hey, dummy, this already exists.

137
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:06,960
Go watch it.

138
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,560
And it gives you a direct link right the way through to Plex's UI.

139
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,800
And there's nothing I would say that stops these kind of apps integrating with Jellyfin

140
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,760
directly.

141
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,920
It's just that Plex has been the tallest nail for a very long time now.

142
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,040
And so if you are a developer targeting this space, it's only natural that you would target

143
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,080
Plex first.

144
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,120
Yeah, I suppose so.

145
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,560
Plus, you know, Plex has the company you can interface with if you're another business.

146
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,800
I think the other thing that they have going for them obviously is they have a really well

147
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,040
established API, really well documented, and then they have that big user base.

148
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,240
You just add all that stuff up.

149
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,880
And I understand why people are building for it first.

150
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:53,120
Overseer, though, which Overseer, by the way, is spelled Overseer, is that what it is?

151
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,600
Let me look.

152
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,120
There'll be a link in the show notes, people.

153
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,440
Yeah, yeah, Overseer.dev, if you want to check it out.

154
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,480
It does support local accounts, but then you lose one of the nice things that Overseer

155
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,640
supports, which is it will integrate with your Plex user accounts and it supports restricting

156
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,080
media to certain users, which is really handy when you have kids.

157
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,360
Again, it's part of that damn ecosystem.

158
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,720
And I've been using this for several months and it's just so easy to pull it up.

159
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,400
So again, they're not a sponsor on the show, but tail scale on my phone, right?

160
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,240
So I connect tail scale.

161
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,120
I pull this up in a web browser on my phone.

162
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,800
It's perfectly formatted.

163
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,480
I can hand it to my wife, she can type in what she wants, she can do her browsing,

164
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,680
get it all set up.

165
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,960
It's a real winner.

166
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,200
And I mean, it's not impossible to use it with Jellyfin, but it just wouldn't have

167
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,560
that level of integration.

168
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,040
Right.

169
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,400
And we touched briefly on the third rail at the beginning of this.

170
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,960
You don't have to use it in that context either.

171
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,000
You could literally just use it as a wish list or a watch trending list as to what's

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,400
available on various different services as well.

173
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,640
So it's not limited to only people who wear pirate hats.

174
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,960
Yeah, although I mean, I think that is its core functionality.

175
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,760
I'm not going to lie.

176
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,480
Yeah, possibly.

177
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,120
But you're right.

178
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,880
You could also build a wish list and it will help with some of those tracking services

179
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,600
as well.

180
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,640
And as you would expect, it's just like a container away.

181
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,840
I didn't check the license on it, but I do think it's open source as well.

182
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,800
Yeah, it's up on GitHub.

183
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,160
Check it out over there.

184
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,600
Overseer is a really good one.

185
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,920
It's a Node.js app and the source code is all on GitHub.

186
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,760
Linode.com slash SSH.

187
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,120
That's where you go to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

188
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,720
It's just a great way to support the show.

189
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,560
So it's Linode.com slash SSH.

190
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,080
Linode is simple cloud hosting.

191
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,680
When you want to put something up in the cloud, you want infrastructure you have under your

192
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,000
control with root access that is super fast and affordable.

193
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,480
Well, Linode is 30% to 50% cheaper than the major hyperscalers out there.

194
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,280
And Linode can also be a fantastic platform to learn.

195
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,960
I know I tell you guys about how we use it as our own lab and it's also where we deploy

196
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,320
all our stuff in production, like our new websites being built out and we'll run from

197
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,880
there.

198
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,040
Just about anything we've built in the last two and a half, three years.

199
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,600
But it's also where I go to learn.

200
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,160
You know, they have Kali Linux on there right now and cybersecurity is a huge field.

201
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,760
And if you're going to get familiar with cybersecurity at all, you're going to be worth

202
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,200
your salt at all.

203
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,920
You got to get Linux skills.

204
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,040
You got to train up.

205
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,280
You just you have to understand how these systems are built from the ground up.

206
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,840
And why not just tear something down over and over again, break and fix, break and fix

207
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,880
on Linode.

208
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,760
It's so fast.

209
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,280
You can get started in just seconds.

210
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,240
And, you know, sure, you could like spin up a VM on your box, but there's no substitute

211
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,640
for learning on an actual Linux machine that has really good performance that installs

212
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,720
packages in seconds, has a fantastic Internet connection.

213
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Linode allows you to spin up and work with Linux servers with a distribution of your

214
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:56,960
choice.

215
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,680
They got all the good ones, real compute power in a real data center.

216
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,040
They regularly keep their software and their hardware as up to date as possible.

217
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,160
Run out MVME storage, 11 data centers around the world, AMD epic processors.

218
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,720
And they have so many other great features, too.

219
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,080
I use the crap out of the S3 compatible object storage.

220
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,680
Alex loves the fact that it's no problem to use things like Ansible.

221
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
Of course, Terraform and Kubernetes support it as well.

222
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,000
And they have the best support in the business.

223
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,000
Sometimes that's really nice if you, your friends, your family or your business depend

224
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,240
on it.

225
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,120
It's nice to know you've got support 24 7 365 with a real human being.

226
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,360
So go get $100 and support the show and try out Linode.

227
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Linode is just our hosting provider of choice.

228
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,040
They're a great place to go.

229
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,360
My friends have been there for a decade.

230
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,680
I'm a newbie compared to them and I'm coming on three years and I'm still extremely

231
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,000
happy.

232
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,760
So go try it out.

233
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,880
Go see what you can do.

234
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,560
Go see what you can learn.

235
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,000
Go deploy something.

236
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,560
Linode.com slash SSH.

237
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,800
Now, picking back up on the theme of this episode of perhaps we should know better and

238
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,960
not be surprised when big companies get hacked or do things with our data that we don't

239
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,680
particularly like or agree with.

240
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,200
There was an article in the New York Times this week about a gentleman whose young child

241
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,320
toddler, I think, had some kind of a medical issue.

242
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,120
And as part of the telemedicine procedure that this father worried parent was doing,

243
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:36,240
he uploaded some pictures of genitalia of his child's genitalia to his Android phone's

244
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,040
Google automatic photos backup.

245
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:46,960
And as a consequence, he ended up being flagged not only by Google, but by the police and

246
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,080
law enforcement.

247
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,960
Well, Google notified them automatically so conveniently.

248
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,720
Also sent them his entire Google account history, every search, all his location history, all

249
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,760
of his text messages.

250
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,120
They sent everything that he put in there since the early aughts.

251
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,440
Sent it all over to the cops automatically.

252
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,560
You know, the details of this are kind of interesting.

253
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,800
So the wife took the pictures on her iPhone.

254
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,600
She texted them to her husband because he was the one interfacing with the doctor.

255
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,760
His Android automatically backed them up to Google Photos.

256
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:26,080
Then Google's system detected these photos, flagged their child abuse team, they reviewed

257
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:31,200
this guy's kid's crotch's pictures, crotch pictures, and then they sent it all off to

258
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,480
the cops automatically.

259
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,400
They at that point then disabled his Google account, which also disabled his Google Fi

260
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,360
cell phone service.

261
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,880
So then the police could no longer get a hold of him, which became an issue later, and they

262
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,080
just presumed he was guilty.

263
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,520
And I think the thing that I find disturbing about this is these are not pictures that

264
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,840
are in an existing CSAM model database of known child pornography.

265
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:02,640
These are brand new bespoke pictures that Google identified as child porn in this guy's

266
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,200
Google Photo database, and then initiated this entire auto flag service.

267
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,920
And this Mark, we only have his first name, he's not the only one.

268
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,840
The New York Times article, which we'll link to in the show notes, talks about another

269
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:21,120
dad that this happened to around the same time, because of course more people are using

270
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,320
telemedicine now, and so it's happening more and more.

271
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,800
And the other little detail in this story that's horrible, besides the fact that this

272
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,160
guy's cell phone service was turned off, the police have notified Google that they've

273
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,720
cleared him, and Google refuses to turn his account back on.

274
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,560
And this is true for the other ones as well.

275
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,760
This is really what gets me going about this particular story.

276
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:53,680
At what point did we as a society decide that Google were now the law, right?

277
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:01,200
This guy, you know, the people that we have chosen as society to say, you are the one

278
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,840
who decides whether someone has committed a crime or not, the police, detective, whatever

279
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:14,800
it might be, FBI, whoever, at some point, Google, without really realizing it, probably

280
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,360
have more power over you than that individual does, because not only are you locked out

281
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,600
of your cell service, you're also locked out of, was it 15 plus years worth of correspondence

282
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,600
and PDF receipts and all the other stuff that ends up in everybody's Gmail inboxes.

283
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,960
Yeah, and the other dad who also got flagged was in the middle of a mortgage deal and was

284
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,080
trying to get papers to sign to buy his house, and they were in his Gmail inbox, and because

285
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:48,000
Gmail did this, because Gmail got turned off, he had to ask the broker to switch to a new

286
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,480
email account, which then flagged him for fraud, and they thought that was suspicious,

287
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,000
which then threw his entire mortgage back into review, because his Gmail account got

288
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,560
disabled.

289
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:05,120
I think the saddest thing for me about this, and by this I mean sort of modern tech, Google,

290
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,360
Apple, Facebook, all this kind of surveillance culture, is that we've ended up spiraling

291
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:19,200
into this user manipulation, user surveillance space without, honestly, in autopilot, without

292
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,640
really realizing that we were doing it, piece by piece, little by little, all these little

293
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,440
apps have eroded into our little worlds, and now Google Photos is a fundamental part of

294
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,000
my personal photo backup strategy.

295
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,800
I have a young child, and I take pictures of her in the bath. At what point do I run

296
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,800
the risk of Google flagging my images and having my stuff locked out? It's not unlikely

297
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,520
at this point.

298
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,080
We also know that these classifiers and these models don't always get it right. Computer

299
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,800
vision is still early, and everybody listening to this show knows that's a fact.

300
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,560
Hot dog, not a hot dog.

301
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:09,920
Right, and the reality is these things could get it wrong, and the best case scenario in

302
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,320
that situation is that a team of people at Google are looking at whatever private pictures

303
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,440
you have, and you never even know anything happened. But back in Google's headquarters,

304
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,760
a group of human beings are looking at your private pictures because they've been flagged.

305
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,560
That's the best case scenario, right? And the worst case scenario is what's happened

306
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:34,960
to Mark here, where everything got shut off, and then his entire account was downloaded

307
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,840
and sent to the cops to review, where if Mark, at any point in the last 15 years, had done

308
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,480
something else illegal, it would be in there. Emails, text messages, photos, all of his

309
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,880
location information, every place he ever went on Google Maps, every search request

310
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,920
he's ever made into Google, every single Google doc, every spreadsheet he's ever created,

311
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,640
everything got sent to the cops. They could review that, and you know, I mean, maybe some

312
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,640
people will come out squeaky clean, and maybe others, there'd be something else in there.

313
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,640
And I don't know what happens there, but I doubt it just gets deleted. You know, it's

314
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,480
just, the precedent here is horrible.

315
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,920
Around the time of Brexit, I remember having a discussion with a family member about, well,

316
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,520
I've got nothing to hide, so I've got nothing to fear, right? And I think this is the insidious

317
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,200
conclusion of that, I've got nothing to hide. You know, this is a perfectly innocent,

318
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,400
legitimate use case of taking a photograph like that, and it's landed this guy in a lot

319
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,600
of trouble. I'm not totally familiar with wiretapping laws on this side of the pond,

320
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,160
but I do wonder if legislation needs to catch up with this kind of thing, because as far

321
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,440
as I'm aware, at least, it's a federal crime to wiretap somebody without their permission

322
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,360
or consent, without some kind of a court order. And I don't know if a EULA would really

323
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,680
constitute a genuine admission of my consent to do this. Google will probably argue the

324
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,320
opposite, but without some kind of a court order, this feels like a stretch to me.

325
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,240
Nat Malkus Yeah, so I know that the Fourth Amendment

326
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,000
and those protections apply to anything the state does. The state would not be able to

327
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,120
just do this, but we've privatized this now with Google, and of course, with all these

328
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,880
other tech companies, and I do know that the lines there are a lot less clear. And so,

329
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,760
the beauty thing is, is there's this just not-my-problem legal situation that Google's

330
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,920
in and that the state is in, where Google can collect all the information and use it

331
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,600
infinitum for their own value, and then they also have all the incentives in the world

332
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,880
to share that data with law enforcement at the lowest friction way possible in the most

333
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,560
efficient way possible. That's their incentive structure, for obvious reasons. And I don't

334
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:56,080
think that's going to change, because both parties involved, both the business and the

335
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,920
state, are very satisfied with this arrangement. Alex, it's been a long time since I have seen

336
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,840
a tech story that actually genuinely gave me chills, right? I mean, I've been like,

337
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:16,320
oh, I've been outraged or whatever, but actually, like, oh no. Uh-oh. We are already, all of

338
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,240
us that are dads that have ever taken pictures of our kids in the bath or anything like that,

339
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,840
we are all now at risk. All of us. And we just walked right into it, even though we've

340
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,480
been talking about the risk for years. I've thought a lot about this, and I've realized

341
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:38,560
the truth is, these services have a lot of upside. They have a lot of reach. They have

342
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:44,400
a lot of features. There's just a lot of upside to them. Google Photos is very, very tempting,

343
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,040
because they manage the storage. They manage the replication in their servers and their

344
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,880
data centers. They manage the bandwidth. And they're kind of just doing it automatically,

345
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,800
so you don't even have to think about it. And as a parent, the last thing you ever want

346
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,480
to lose is your pictures. If your whole house burned down, but you saved nothing but your

347
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,800
pictures, you'd say, well, at least I still have my pictures, right? They're critical.

348
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,840
You kind of just get pushed into it, because it's the default, both on iOS and on Android,

349
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,160
because this is eventually going to be happening on iOS as well. You just set up the phone

350
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,480
by default, and all these things are on. And they're just kind of like, well, why not leave

351
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,600
them on? Because my photos, they're important. One of the worst aspects of this, which we

352
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,720
kind of already touched on, though, is that even though law enforcement said this chap

353
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,520
was not guilty of committing a crime, he still doesn't have his Gmail account back. Google

354
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,320
have told the New York Times they stand by these decisions, and this guy will be locked

355
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,960
out, I presume, forever. That's it. He's done. Yeah, the response was just like, well, we

356
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,640
find child porn to be abhorrent. And who can argue with that? That's a perfectly rational

357
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,640
statement. Won't somebody think of the children? That's how it always starts, though. I think

358
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,920
my baseline advice now is, if you're going to use Google services, if you're going to

359
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:06,320
be dependent on Google services, you have got to have a valid backup. Valid backup for anything

360
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:13,680
that's important. Email, calendar, you got to have it. And I guess that's the bare minimum.

361
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:21,200
But both in the case of Plex and in the case of Google Photos and all that, I feel like

362
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,440
the math has just changed for me. I think it's time to give Photo Prism another try.

363
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,760
I think it's time to really try to not use Google Photos at all. I took a break for a

364
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,120
while, and then I got back on. And then I took a break for a while, and then I got back on.

365
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,920
But this is too far for me. If I don't pay attention to this red flag, and then something

366
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,880
happens to me, what kind of an idiot am I going to feel like? What kind of an ultimate

367
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,840
idiot? This is like, I've got to pay attention to these warning signs, because the thing that

368
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,880
seems to be clear, and I'm curious to know if you agree, and I'm not happy to say this,

369
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,800
but it's getting worse. And the longer you participate, and the more data you give it,

370
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:08,560
the worse you make it. Like in the case of my Google account, I got a Gmail account within

371
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:16,640
nine months of Gmail launching beta. I have Gmail chats with my ex-wife, Angela, when we

372
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:25,600
were still just meeting. I have an entire relationships worth of history in that Google

373
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:33,520
chat. And I feel like I got to purge everything. I'm starting to feel a little more like Richard

374
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:41,680
Stallman, like I need to go off grid almost. Because the other risk with Plex, Alex, and I

375
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,880
think the real risk with Plex, they're going to get sold. They're going to get sold to a major

376
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,280
entertainment company, and then they're going to have all our metadata about what's on our servers,

377
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,560
about what we're watching, about what our watch habits are, because you know they're collecting

378
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:00,080
all of that. And then with Google, the risk is that they're just going to get more invasive,

379
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,000
they're going to do more things in your life, and then they just have that automatic pipeline

380
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:11,440
to your local friendly authorities. And both are becoming more and more real, tangible risks

381
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,800
to everyday people.

382
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:18,080
Couldn't agree with you more. And it's got me looking for ways to back up my Gmail in the last

383
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,640
few days. I actually put a thread in the self-hosted subreddit today. As we record, it's

384
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,520
Wednesday, the day before, or two days before this episode airs. So maybe there'll be some more

385
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,600
answers to that thread in the meantime. I'll put a link to it in the show notes, of course.

386
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:40,160
Lots of people suggest using Thunderbird as a backup. I'm not sure if I agree with that as a

387
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:47,040
backup per se, because it still requires some kind of a desktop environment in order for

388
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,720
Thunderbird to run, as far as I'm aware.

389
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,160
Yeah, you'd have to fire it up, right?

390
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,800
And keep it going.

391
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:56,400
Yeah, exactly. There are other options, apparently offline IMAP plus Dovecot is another one,

392
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,680
and that will be usable with any mail software that uses SMTP. There's lots of other people

393
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,000
talking about different ways to sync IMAP. Apparently there is a Docker Thunderbird image,

394
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,640
I'm told, in the chat as an option. So that will work quietly in the background. But one

395
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,240
that a listener recommended to me in Discord this afternoon was one called Got Your Back

396
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:22,720
from the GAM Team, G-Y-B. Again, link in the show notes. This is a command line tool for

397
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,560
backing up your Gmail messages to your computer using Gmail's API over HTTPS.

398
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,520
So I had a quick spin of this before the show, just on my laptop, which is a MacBook.

399
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,280
And it was a little fiddly to get set up, you know, if you've ever set up an API key

400
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,520
for like Google Maps or anything like that, and created a no auth application with a client

401
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,520
secret and a client token and what have you. It was a little bit fiddly, probably took

402
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,400
about 10 minutes to get it going. I put it on one of my lesser known Gmail account, which

403
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,880
only has about 10,000 emails in it, not my primary one as the first try. And it works

404
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,960
perfectly, works exactly as advertised. All 10,000 messages were downloaded in.eml format,

405
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,440
I was then able to open those with the mail client on Mac, view them in their full HTML

406
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,000
glory, and it just worked.

407
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,080
Hey, I like that it's command line, that it's basically a bash script, because then I could

408
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
just cron that.

409
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,840
That is something worth mentioning, actually. The project seems a little immature in some

410
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,920
ways to me, because there's an issue in their GitHub, where someone said that their Wiki

411
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:36,640
is open to public edits, and some insidious individual decided to change the download

412
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,400
location of the binary or one of the scripts or something, so that it wasn't the official

413
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:48,400
developer's script, and so some people had some unverified binaries being downloaded.

414
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,080
Oh no. And you never really know how many people got that and what's in there, that's

415
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,760
too bad. Yeah, that's early days stuff. You know, if anybody out there in the audience

416
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:02,120
knows of a way to do this, something you could automate, but just the whole account, like

417
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:06,320
the Google takeout functionality, boost in your answer, because I'd like to just back

418
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,960
up everything, and then, I don't know, I'm on the edge of going over there and hitting

419
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,160
delete. I am on the edge, man. If you've got the skills, you've got the infrastructure,

420
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,360
you got the tools, it's really a matter of time. So I think what I've got to do is figure

421
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:27,440
out a weekend where I just get it done, and then I get everything set up, and then I go

422
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:33,320
just delete it. And I hope to Linus that they actually truly delete it when I tell them

423
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:38,840
to delete it, because who really knows? Who really knows? Who really knows? Now this is

424
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,480
another topic, this is photos, this is a little bit unrelated to Gmail itself, but obviously

425
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,120
it's a fundamental part of the Google experience. There is a new self-hosted app on the scene

426
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,720
called Image. Now I haven't checked this out yet, actually, in person, because the developer

427
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,280
states very clearly this is not yet ready for production usage, and I don't really want

428
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:05,120
to put my photos through it yet. However, every time I see this pop up on Reddit, it

429
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,600
gets absolutely covered in praise. Everybody has nothing but good things to say about it,

430
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,800
so I'm watching this project extremely closely. I've had several people mail in and tell me

431
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:20,320
about it, don't worry, it's on our radar, we will cover it, but once it goes into a

432
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,480
air quotes production ready state. Yeah, I'll keep an eye on it for sure. Heck, I might

433
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,800
even throw a few photos in there when it's in an earlier state, but yeah, I wouldn't

434
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,320
want to switch the whole library over. But Image, I like the name. We'll have a link

435
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,560
in the show notes.

436
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:50,800
Humio is a centralized, log, management, and observability platform. The company was founded

437
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,160
by developers in Denmark in 2016, and they've really been building something incredible

438
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,880
since then. I think the real beauty of Humio, the thing they've really cracked, is they

439
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,640
can take logs from any source and make them usable. You don't have to constantly massage

440
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,920
the format, it doesn't need a schema, you just pump them all into Humio, and they're

441
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,920
there when you need them, and the dashboard to review it all is great. Humio's platform

442
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,820
is crazy. Their index-free architecture means you can ingest over a petabyte of data per

443
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,800
day and search that with sub-second latency. And Humio's up to 80% cheaper than the competing

444
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,320
platforms like Splunk or Elastic, thanks to its reduced hardware and computational footprint.

445
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:32,000
I think the best way for our audience to get going is probably the Community Edition. Humio

446
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,800
Community Edition is the largest no-cost data ingestion offering on the market today, allowing

447
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:44,140
you to ingest up to 16 gigs per day, 7-day retention included. It's not a trial period,

448
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,520
you get it for the long haul. This is perfect for us self-hosters because, yeah, you can

449
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,360
put your home assistant logs in there, you can put your NGINX logs in there, and like

450
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,840
I said earlier, you can put just about anything in there, and Humio knows what to do with

451
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,440
it. It gives you the ability to bring all that stuff together, view it in one place,

452
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,280
and that makes troubleshooting easier. It's so much better than having separate places

453
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,640
to look when you need to figure out what went wrong. That's amateur stuff. Go get like a

454
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,720
pro setup, right? Because when this is your home setup, it's your hobby, you don't want

455
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,120
to have to fight with it, you just want the information. You want to be able to fix it

456
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,400
quick, you want it easy, you want it usable, you don't want it to be another job. That's

457
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:26,600
where Humio Community Edition could be perfect. So go get started for free at humio.com slash

459
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,520
Mason So you're all aboard the ZigBee train now,

460
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,680
huh? That seems to have left the station.

461
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,360
Alex Yeah, I was like trying so hard not to, because

462
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,040
I already got a lot of Z-Wave, and I've already got Wi-Fi devices. Do I really need a third

463
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:52,900
network, Alex? The answer is no. No. No, I do not. But yeah, that doesn't stop me anyways.

464
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:59,560
This one really was because I tried everything else, and after last week's episode, I got

465
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,320
a couple of notes almost immediately after the episode went out. They were just like,

466
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:09,080
hey, you got to check out the Aquera temperature sensor. It's ZigBee, but it's battery powered,

467
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:15,000
and it gives you real time data. As the temperature changes, it sends in updates. You know, it's

468
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,940
not this problem where it falls asleep and drops off the network like you had with the

469
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:25,320
Shelly H&T. And so I thought, all right, I've been wanting to get on the ZigBee train and

470
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,000
just try it. I knew eventually I wanted to give it a go, and I'm thinking about replacing

471
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,120
my Z-Wave devices, and if ZigBee worked out, that would probably be for the best. So I

472
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:39,960
grabbed the Aquera temperature and humidity sensor and grabbed a KonBee ZigBee stick,

473
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,040
which is like a German ZigBee stick, which just works out of the box with Home Assistant.

474
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,440
And I got to say, Alex, this is the one. This is the one. I really like this. I think it's

475
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,580
based on the same Yaomei chipset that a lot of these are based on. And it has two years

476
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:02,440
of battery life, which is outrageous because the things about the size of a bottle cap,

477
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,060
you know, it's only square. It's super, super small. It's also the smallest temperature

478
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:14,160
sensor of all of the ones that I've tried. It says on the box requires the Aquera hub.

479
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,240
That just means it just needs a ZigBee device to connect to. So once you put it on the ZigBee

480
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,480
network, which takes about a millisecond, you just pull the battery, little plastic

481
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,200
separator and click the button when you're in discover mode in ZigBee, and it's connected

482
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
immediately.

483
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,040
What are you using for ZigBee? Are you using ZHA or...?

484
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,200
Yeah, I'm using the built-in, yeah. And it's been fine. You know, it's cleaner and nicer

485
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,860
than the Z-Wave stuff is. Of course, I'm using the older Z-Wave stuff. And ZigBee itself

486
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:47,440
I like. One of the things that I think is fantastic about it is when you add wired devices,

487
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:54,480
you know, permanently powered devices like a smart plug, just like Z-Wave, it builds

488
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,360
the network out more. They become repeaters out there. It has about a hundred meter line

489
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,760
of sight range. And you know how big the studio is. It's not that big, but the temperature

490
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:10,520
sensors in the far corner of the garage and the HomoSystem Blue is in the other far corner

491
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,700
of the studio. So it's at the maximum separation you could get here in the studio and it's

492
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:20,540
still working pretty good. I think maybe I could slide a repeater in there and probably

493
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:24,060
boost the signal a little bit, but it's getting the job done.

494
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:29,520
Any permanently powered device like a plug socket, like a smart plug, which is ZigBee

495
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,400
ready would be a great repeater. And I've got a couple of those. Also, light bulbs turn

496
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,440
out to be really great ZigBee repeaters. Like all my Hue bulbs are connected to ZHA these

497
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,840
days and they're all permanently powered and they all extend my ZigBee network. But I'm

498
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,600
really glad that you're using this temperature sensor now. Cause I've had one since I think

499
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:54,080
just before you came in April. There's one in my fridge, which works great. And I've

500
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:00,240
got a couple in Ziploc freezer bags in the freezers and they don't like minus 15 Celsius

501
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:07,280
temperatures too much. The two year battery life is more like two months minus 15. But

502
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,640
I must say the one in the fridge, which is typically around five Celsius, that's been

503
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,040
on the original battery ever since I got it. So, so far so good.

504
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,840
I do think I'll be buying more of these. So that's good to know. I still have my Aotec

505
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:24,160
Z-Wave in my freezer at home on the original battery. I put it in there, which has been

506
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:31,000
months now, but it's one of those bigger lithium Duracell. So I could see this is such a smaller

507
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,120
a smaller battery in this guy cause it's such a tiny device. So this has the CR 2032 battery

508
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:40,800
in it, which is a lot smaller. It does also come in the box with a handy little circular

509
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,480
double-sided tape, which fits perfectly on the back of the sensor. So you could just

510
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,680
slap that on there and then you stick it anywhere.

511
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,760
You are getting roasted in the chat by the way. Oh yeah. Yeah. She'd go and see this.

512
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,000
You know, the little dog from up who's like, okay, Chris is like new standard. Okay. I'm

513
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,160
in. Yeah, I know. I know. It's true. It is true. Here's why I was okay. Going with ZigBee

514
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:09,840
right is basically what matter is. Matter is based on, on ZigBee and it's an open source

515
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:21,760
spec. It's going to be around forever. I mean, heck the Mars Rover is using it. It's so cool.

516
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,400
And Z-Wave, Z-Wave is like end of life. So I think what I'm going to do is, although

517
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,560
it sucks cause I have so many Z-Wave devices, but I think over this next year, I don't know,

518
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,560
maybe sooner, probably a lot sooner because I just want to get rid of my home assistant

519
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,640
set up and start over. I think I'm going to just transition to ZigBee. So I'll have ZigBee

520
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:47,360
and wifi devices, but honestly I prefer not to have my IOT devices on wifi. It's heavy

521
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,880
in terms of battery life and CPU and power, but also it's just not a great standard for

522
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,280
it. It's a lot, it's, it's a lot of chatter and the more chatter, the worse the wifi network.

523
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,000
Where like the ZigBee network, the individual devices can actually improve each other's

524
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,400
signal and help route each other. And the more devices you add to a point, make it stronger.

525
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,520
So it's clearly a better way to go for these types of devices, but it does, it does suck

526
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,180
having yet a third, a new, any wireless standard. I, that's why I resisted it, but it was the

527
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:23,120
audience that convinced me to try it and it is now my favorite. And it's nice to see the

528
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,360
ZigBee integration work so well in home assistant. It makes me feel better.

529
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,920
You'll be using the Ikea trad free buttons next. Just you wait.

530
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,240
Oh man. I'm already on Alibaba and I'm already on Amazon. Just looking at all the possible

531
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:41,280
ZigBee devices. In fact, I want to install led lights in the wheel wells of dupes to

532
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,600
help with rodents and stuff. And I don't want an led light strip. I would like, you know,

533
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:52,480
a big bright light that is ZigBee. That's DC powered that I could mount in there and

534
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,760
then home assistant could turn on in the evening and turn off in the morning and shine light

535
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,240
down on the ground. And I've seen lots of light strips. I can find lots of DC power

536
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,960
ZigBee controllers, but I would like a mountable led light. I haven't seen it. And of course

537
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,000
it'd have to be really weatherproof cause it'd be in the wheel well. So you're going

538
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,860
down the road with rain, but that's my next thing. I, I, I wanted it. I want to just kind

539
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:21,360
of convert over. I'd like to get some ZigBee lighting. I got to replace some of my light

540
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,500
strips. You know, I got to do some of that crap. There's, there's some bulbs and some

541
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:32,040
smart plugs and some, a lot of sensors. It does seem to work really well. And I was impressed

542
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,640
with the performance and the fact that it's battery life is supposedly pretty good and

543
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:41,280
it's still giving me near real time data. Like as we're doing the show here, I'm watching

544
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,400
the temperature in the studio garage just go up and up and up in real time. It's wonderful.

545
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,880
Oh, that's fun. Yeah. Useful. Do you have an also a ZigBee anxiety sensor to go with

546
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,480
that? I will soon. Probably. I'm checking Alibaba every day now. There's all kinds of

547
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,560
crazy ZigBee devices. So I think, uh, yeah, wheel well lights would be my next thing.

548
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,440
Temperature sensors, just getting them replaced, just phasing out the Z wave stuff. So if you

549
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,360
got any tips out there, let me know. Of course you can always tell us in person because the

550
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:15,400
West coast meetups are coming up soon to details at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

551
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,720
We have a lot of events. We have a Southern Oregon event. We have a Northern California

552
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:24,400
event. We have a Southern California event. Um, we have random meetups we'll do called

553
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,880
micro meetups as we're going down the road. And we have all of them listed out at meetup.com

554
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,360
slash Jupiter broadcasting, finalizing the details right now, as Alex and I are recording,

555
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:39,960
the wife lady is chatting with our insiders in our matrix West coast crew room, bit.ly

556
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:46,000
slash West coast crew. And they're in there chatting details. We were all set and ready

557
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,920
to go to McMinnimans in Portland. We have a listener that works there that invited us

558
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,840
and even offered a spot for juxtapark. Like sweet, right? And we're like, awesome. This

559
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:58,480
is going to be great. We'll get like, you know, the inside scoop because the guy works

560
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,840
there. And then as they're figuring out details, we realized there's like a really well known

561
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,760
band coming in that night and the place is going to be absolutely slammed. And that's

562
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,560
the kind of details we just wouldn't know unless we were talking to locals in that matrix

563
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,760
chat room. And so we caught that and we're pivoting and we're figuring that out. But

564
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,960
those kinds of little details, they save the day. So if you're on the West coast and you're

565
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,880
going to be anywhere near where we're doing a meetup, we could use your brain bit.ly slash

566
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,880
West coast crew. I think the JPL by the time we do the next episode, we'll have the JPL

567
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,600
names too for folks that are making it. Alex will be there.

568
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,720
Yeah. Yeah. You try and stop me. I think you'll be at the Southern meetup too that we have

569
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,560
outside of the JPL event as well.

570
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,200
Yeah, hopefully I'm going to be trying to do I think three or four days in the LA Pasadena

571
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:49,700
area around the meetup. So really looking forward to it. Yeah, must be honest.

572
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,520
It's going to be nerdy. It's going to be fun. It's going to be good to get together and

573
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,960
hopefully it won't be so hot.

574
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,920
I'm just taking a sip from my Pop OS mug glass that I got on our last factory tour. I don't

575
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,200
wish to poo poo system 76 because that was a really fun tour. But I think JPL might be

576
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,500
slightly cooler. Just a little bit.

577
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:14,880
It's going to be a real memory now, but it's cool. Let's be fair. So I've reached into

578
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,840
our boost bag and I've pulled out like our top five boost this week. These aren't all

579
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:23,240
of them, but we did 100% read all of them. So thank you everybody who boosted in. We're

580
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,560
just going to pick a few of them this week to keep things moving. Prozac boosted in with

581
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,400
a row of ducks, 2222 sats with his new podcast app. He says, hello guys. I'm listening to

582
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,760
episode 77 about the constant issues with home assistant. Have you considered moving

583
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,720
to something like Hubitat? They sell an AIO hub with Z-Wave and Zigbee built in. It's

584
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,280
a full device ready to go. The platform has allowed me to focus on the automation aspects

585
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:53,780
rather than managing has and everything is locally processed. And I went and looked.

586
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,920
They have a device like ready to go. Alex. I don't know. It doesn't seem like the solution

587
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:02,720
for me. I like having my own hardware, but has the idea of switching away from home assistant

588
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,240
crossed your mind at all? Or is that just not an area you're willing to go to? It's

589
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,600
crossed my mind typically when I'm talking to you because you're a cranky old man about

590
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:16,000
it these days. But I don't know, maybe we should get some hardware in for testing, right?

591
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,600
Maybe maybe we should write it off as a tax write off or something, get it in for testing

592
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:25,200
or something like that. Hubitat, reach out. We'll give it. I would give it a test. Cost

593
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,000
peel in, boosted in with 36,900 sats. He says, hey, self-hosters, I need to confess. I'm

594
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,040
one of the lizard people. I mean, it's a Soos user. I found Linux when I was 15 years or

595
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:41,600
something like that. You're old. I was at the Sea Scouts and my troop leader used Soos

596
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:46,240
version 9.2. That started my adventure and I never looked back. It was Windows XP days

597
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,320
back then. I learned VMware, then Docker. And I know you guys these days talk a lot

598
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:57,160
about NixOS and friends, but have you tried out Soos in auto? Yes. It's become my standard.

599
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:02,800
Thanks for the work. Yeah, we actually got a lot of people who are Soos fans in the audience.

600
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:09,000
I guess people like it for their home labs because also Colin boosted with 5,436 sats.

601
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,840
I also wanted to give a big thumbs up for open Soos. It's easy to use and powerful.

602
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:19,400
It's been the center of my home lab and home automation. You know, Soos was one of the

603
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:24,440
early distros to let you like define how you wanted everything set up in that auto yast.

604
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,300
So I guess I kind of see why it could be a good home lab. It just feels like things have

605
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:34,360
moved on, but they must be very stable because you never hear any drama about Soosie, do

606
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:38,600
you? Never. You don't hear people like my Soos machine died. You're right. Colin also

607
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,560
gives a big plus one to the Aquaria Zigbee temp sensors. He says he uses them and the

608
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:50,720
battery seemed to last. So, OK, do you like them? Colin likes them. I really wanted the

609
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,160
Shelly one to work with the E Ink display. I really wanted that to be the one I use everywhere

610
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:59,680
because I like having that display. I could almost I mean, I bought a couple of them so

611
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,880
I could just use them for that. And then Purple Dog boosted in with our last boost, 2,500

612
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:10,600
sats. OK, I was listening to the section where you guys were talking about dying and leaving

613
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,720
access to your loved ones while I was doing some housework. I slipped over and I narrowly

614
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,480
avoided cracking my head on the freezer. So he decided it might be a sign he should boost

615
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,480
in.

616
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,480
Forshadowing much?

617
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,800
We got a row of ducks from user 604 who recommended people check out Mikrotik routers, which he

618
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:35,920
has been managing with Ansible. And then we got 1,101 sats from a deck bot who suggested

619
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:42,560
the Pi 4 Compute Module 4 with OpenWRT installed on it for a router for me. That's kind of

620
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,200
clever. He says you get the GUI, you get the SSH, and you can actually configure with Ansible

621
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:51,760
scripts too. OK, I like the idea of using because I bought the Compute Module 4 and

622
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,960
the carrier board specifically to be a router. I hadn't even thought about OpenWRT on there,

623
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,480
to be honest with you, and I'm sort of silly because I've actually I really liked it on

624
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,480
that slate.

625
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,560
I forgot it was even a thing, even though it's on that GL Inet slate thing that I use

626
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,560
as well.

627
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,560
Which has been great.

628
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,560
So, yeah.

629
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,560
Hey, if it's good enough for Starlink.

630
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,160
Right. It's true. They're using it on theirs. Rusta Castaversa also boosted in 2600 sats.

631
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,480
And it sounds like he's going to be clipping episodes for us from time to time. And he

632
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:26,640
already has been whenever Fountain FM's transcription is working. So he has clips from various J.B.

633
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,480
shows and other podcasts. And I'll put a link to his Fountain FM profile for Rusta Castaversa

634
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,200
if you'd like to follow him and get clips from self-hosted and whatnots, which I think

635
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,200
is great.

636
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,160
I think we need more of that in podcasts because I've been discovering a lot of shows via clips.

637
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:47,120
A lot of these new podcast apps, newpodcastapps.com, support clips because that's part of the podcasting

638
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:52,640
2.0 standard. And I have a whole new batch of podcasts I'm listening to because I heard

639
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,640
their clips first.

640
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,480
So thank you, Rusta Casta. If you want to get a new podcast app and boost in newpodcastapps.com,

641
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:05,400
get one that supports boosts or try out Breeze, B-R-E-E-Z dot technology. Now we've got a

642
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,720
little sneak peek at what's coming up.

643
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:12,560
That's right. I was lucky enough to get a notification just in time from Newegg this

644
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:20,260
week that their Intel Arc GPU shipment, the ASRock A380s, was live. And I got in the pre-order

645
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:24,840
queue and I was fast enough, I guess, because it shipped this morning.

646
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,920
Wow. And it's now out of stock again.

647
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:33,360
Yep. Already. That's great. Yeah. So I pre-ordered one for the show. It's $140 plus tax. I think

648
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,880
it came to about 155 ships or something, which is not too bad. And I'll tell you why I'm

649
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:47,200
excited about this, self-hosters. It's because the Intel iGPU that is on my CPU is with QuickSync

650
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,520
been such a game changer for me for hardware transcoding purposes. You know, I use it for

651
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:58,600
my Blue Iris box. I use it for Plex and Jellyfin. Sometimes I even use it for batch transcoding

652
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:02,400
jobs. Like before I got on the plane, I just queued up a bunch of stuff with FFmpeg and

653
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:07,920
it just worked great. And I'll tell you why I'm super excited about these Intel Arc GPUs.

654
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,200
It's because they have QuickSync hardware built into them, including the brand new AV1

655
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,000
codecs. And so I'm really looking forward to putting this through its paces. I'm hoping

656
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I'm going to be able to do some GPU pass-through with it and eventually get rid of my Blue

657
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:29,040
Iris dedicated box and then just have the Windows VM with this GPU. And if it all works,

658
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,280
you will hear all about it on the show and it will be coming up over the next few episodes.

659
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,360
I hope we hear about it if it doesn't work too.

660
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,640
With the state of the Intel Arc drivers by all accounts, that's probably the likely scenario

661
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,040
to start with.

662
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,720
Wow. I'm really glad you were able to get one before they were out of stock again. That

663
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,120
is so cool. Well, if you are listening and thinking, I hope they're not wrapping up.

664
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,400
Well, I've got bad news for you. We are, unless you're a member, because our members get a
