1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Every now and again, a man must take one for the team, for his craft, in the name of science.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This weekend, I put my body on the line.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Against all the odds, I came out the other side unscathed.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I tried the barbecue at the new meetup spot.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I was like, your body on the line? Where is this going?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, I thank you for doing that, though, because I just could not believe it.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You know, a park with a brewery and a barbecue joint that happens to be large enough to serve a large group?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
No, Alex, this is too much like paradise. Such a utopia could not exist.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And so you're like, all right, I'll go check it out.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, pretty much. I mean, so for those that aren't aware, we're having a meetup on the East Coast on April the 9th in Raleigh.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Well, actually, it's a place just outside Raleigh called Nightdale, just to the east.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But there's this park there called Nightdale Station, and on one side is a Texas-style barbecue joint,

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and on the other side is a local brewing company called Oak City Brewing.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And so, you know, it's maybe a five-minute walk between the two places, if that, if you're walking slowly.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And in the middle, it's like a kid's playground, a splash pad, like this little amphitheater-type thing with a stage.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Oh, it's so nice.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What's great is since we brought it up last episode, we now know that, yeah, I'm going, I've already bought my tickets.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
My wife's going, Wes is going, Brent is going.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And my co-host from Koda Radio, Mr. Dominic, is also going.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, I thought that was a super secret untold truth.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Well, by the time it comes, by the time this episode comes out, I think it'll be known.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh, okay.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So if not, then you know what, then you know what, the self-hosted crew should know.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I was worried we'd broken an NDA there.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
No, no.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Besides, he won't listen.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm really looking forward to it.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Now then, in the spirit of trying not to feel too old, can you believe that the Raspberry Pi is 10 years old this week?

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That is something else, huh?

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I would have, if you would have asked me off the top of my head, I think I don't, I don't know if I would have guessed more than seven for some reason.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You know what I mean?

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You know, for me, it's been very strange because I left a retail job and went and did an MSC and then got a job.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And in my, in my life, like my life kind of started as an adult almost after I left that Apple retail job.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And that, I know that I had a Raspberry Pi before then because that's how I started getting involved in Linux in the first place was Unraid.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The before times.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
A Raspberry Pi, yeah.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And yeah, for that to be 10 years ago, it just doesn't seem, doesn't seem possible.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I still remember the introduction.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Evan has a real distinct type of accent and I know you all from over there, you have like different regions.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What, what type is his accent?

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This is the guy that's the founder.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We have a link in the show notes.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm just going to have a quick listen.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh yeah.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You haven't heard it.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's unusual.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yeah.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yeah. You know, you know who he sounds like?

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
My, my equivalent would be Stuart from a bad voltage.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It sounds like Stuart to me, but he sounds a bit like that mixed with poppy.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Right, right.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'd say he's home counties.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So, so that means like Southeast of England sort of not inside London, but sort of the 50 miles in a big circle around London.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yeah.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But it's a unique voice for sure.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He's a unique person and he saw real value in getting the computer down to a price that is nearly affordable by anyone.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And how important that would be for students too, which is something we don't talk a lot about, but it's just so pivotal in those, in those areas.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Well, what's interesting is when Evan launched the Raspberry Pi, he writes that he only expected to sell somewhere between one and 5,000 units total.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And now they've sold millions of them, which is an incredible achievement.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But his use case for it was to get computers, cheap computers into classrooms.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Cause let's think back 10 years ago, what version of windows were we on?

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Windows seven, I think.

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, maybe, maybe eight at that point.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Probably most people on XP really, let's be honest.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Maybe it was windows eight at that point.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Mac OS was what just probably exiting snow leopard era, you know?

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
So a lot's changed in that 10 years.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The iPhone was still very new and you know, people didn't have powerful phones and tablets and stuff in their pockets all the time.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And so for the Raspberry Pi to come along in the schools seemed obvious.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Chromebooks weren't really a thing yet.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You know, it seemed obvious, but now it's a true hobbyist grade tinkerer device.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So there's this whole ecosystem around the Raspberry Pi.

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And I know that you find that a very powerful thing.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I think that's the most important thing.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And I think it's, I don't even think it's just hobbyists, Alex.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I feel like, I don't even know if they should be, but I feel like a lot of little products out there have a Raspberry Pi at the heart of them.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Like secretly in that interview that we'll have linked in the show notes,

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I've been talking about how officially the foundation has put two Raspberry Pis on the international space station,

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
but it turns out there's like way more actually up on the international space station,

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
just because a lot of the other products that NASA has deployed up there have Raspberry Pis built into them.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Just as, you know, I guess it needs some heavy lifting or something.

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah, I really, I find that both alarming and impressive at the same time.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And I have to say, you know, for my use, things are solid as a rock.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I think for some reason early on, they kind of got this reputation as unstable,

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
not production grade for some reason.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And for the most case, I don't think that's ever been true.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I think it's always just been a matter of resources.

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And recently they've been closing the gap on that.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And I, you know, I think we may even possibly be seeing a newer Pi if it wasn't for the supply chain shortages.

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You know, if you think back as well, it was Raspberry Pi OS and Ubuntu didn't support the Pis.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't remember exactly when Ubuntu made an official Pi image,

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
but that was a turning point for me in making the Pi more legitimate.

101
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, oh, for sure.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's been great to see distro adoption.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And I think the even bigger thing has been to see a lot of the Pi's hardware actually make it into the mainline kernel.

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's been the really big thing because that's what took so long.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It really took way too long for that to happen.

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And maybe one of the criticisms where we're still talking about the early days of the Raspberry Pi is like,

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
we've kind of enumerated this on Linux Action News before, but they're not a Linux company, right?

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:01,000
They're a hardware shop and Linux is the operating system that allows them to run and ship the Raspberry Pi desktop.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's a means to an end.

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
They didn't start the Raspberry Pi because they're Linux fans.

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You follow me?

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And so they don't necessarily always have great insight into how the Linux community expects things to work.

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And so they've done things in the past like added Microsoft repos without saying anything to the distribution or,

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
you know, maybe they just work on something for like two years and then just do a big code drop over the wall.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And those things have been tricky for the free software community to assimilate.

116
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But I don't think they've ever been done out of malice.

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Maybe that's a good thing.

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You know, if everybody was beholden to the rules of the system, then they would never disrupt that system.

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And I'm not saying that everything the Pi Foundation has done is absolutely perfect.

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
No company, no foundation, no charity, nothing like that is.

121
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But if you didn't have people that weren't beholden to that rules system, you know, that gatekeeper system, if you like,

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
would we ever see any progress or would it be stymied progress, you know?

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Would it be chaos?

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Maybe.

125
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Maybe.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I think that's being a little melodramatic.

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No, it would be chaos, Alex!

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You know, the other thing to just think about Raspberry Pis and something we've talked about a lot on the show is their energy use.

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Andrew wrote into the show and said energy costs here in the UK are just skyrocketing.

130
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I was just told my electricity bill is increasing by 80%.

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah.

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Holy crap.

133
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Eight zero.

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh, man.

135
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And then another increase will be expected in October.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
My current system is an i3 with an unraid and 40 terabytes of storage.

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And I'm running service loads in Docker.

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I also have two Raspberry Pis, 3B running PyHole, and the entire setup uses around three kilowatt hours a day, which isn't bad,

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
but it runs 25% of my electric bill.

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
So I'm wondering if I can save any on that.

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I don't need to access my files 24 seven and notice that my unraid does support S3 sleep,

142
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
but I'd want some kind of automation around that.

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So I'm not always having to manually turn it on and off.

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Any thoughts or options, guys?

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, what's interesting is over the years, many people have asked me just a simple question,

146
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:31,000
which I've just flippantly said no to, which is, should I worry about something simple like spinning down unused hard drives?

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And you think it's using three or four watts to keep that hard drive spinning?

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Who cares? It's a couple of pounds, maybe that a month, maybe maybe even that across a year.

149
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Generally, the benchmark I used was one watt for an entire year powered on was about one pound, give or take.

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And that was when using, you know, that's when electricity prices were about 15 pence a kilowatt hour.

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What I'm seeing now in the UK is energy prices being 50 or 60 pence a kilowatt hour.

152
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And that is a massive, I don't need to tell you guys, a massive difference.

153
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And that kind of changes the equation significantly.

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And so one of the angles we wanted to talk about on today's show was the energy usage of Raspberry Pi.

155
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Chris, you can give us some really good insight from all of your monitoring you do in the RV and start to think about,

156
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
does it make sense to have that old dual Xeon box in the basement?

157
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Probably not anymore. Does it make sense to keep an old i3 system with 40 terabytes of storage like Andrew writes in?

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Well, it depends how many hard drives is hard drive density worth considering?

159
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You know, number of watts per drive doesn't change.

160
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But you can change the number of drives quite easily by going from, let's say, 10 4 terabyte drives to 4 10 terabyte drives.

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And that could save you the price of a drive at 50 pence a kilowatt hour within a year.

162
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yeah. Oh, boy, Alex. So when I decided to go, actually, I'll back up.

163
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
And I'll address a few things I think you got to think about before you go this route and really go to the energy savings.

164
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So when I first started building the setup for JOOBS, I built it around an X86 system, an X86 NAS based system.

165
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And I thought that was the way to go because I consider myself to be somebody who really optimizes for performance.

166
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah, I like it. I like everything to be as fast as possible.

167
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's that's why I'll get I'll get I'll get a laptop with 64 gigs of RAM.

168
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So that way I know that three or four times a year I'm running five or six VMs at once.

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm going to have a fast system. And so I kind of went big.

170
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I went with a 12 terabyte array set up and an X86 box.

171
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And the issue immediately became the power usage because I'm in a very restricted environment where I am trying to run off solar and not use generator as much as possible,

172
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
especially with the price of fuel getting higher.

173
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
And so I pretty quickly pivoted to the Raspberry Pi after I asked myself a few basic questions.

174
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And this is what I want to convey to you all. How much performance do you really need?

175
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Initially, I would have said all of the performance, but then when I started thinking about it, I thought, well, do I really need 12 terabytes of videos here?

176
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Or could I offload some of those videos and ISO images and pictures and documents to somewhere where it's much cheaper to run that storage and then just cache two terabytes of local stuff?

177
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What's like the two terabytes of stuff I really needed?

178
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And then once I kind of started thinking about that, I realized, you know, if I optimized on my TV end, I actually don't even need GPU decoding support.

179
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And then all of a sudden a Raspberry Pi is looking pretty good.

180
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If I know I have hardware decoding support in my set top box, then I just took a whole category of requirements away from my server box.

181
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And I started thinking about that a little bit more. I thought, well, how fast do I really need my CPU? How many applications am I running?

182
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And I threw up a Raspberry Pi four and I threw my applications on there.

183
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And I was blown away by the fact that I found it reasonable.

184
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:31,000
And when I use my home assistant system or when I'm using Rantio or whatever you call it or sync thing, generally I can say, yeah, I think I could I could stand for it to be a tad faster.

185
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But my expectations are more about nailing that that power envelope and less about nailing that performance envelope now.

186
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And so I'm perfectly willing to just have a slightly, slightly sluggish home assistant set up for just total, total optimization on the power side.

187
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And it was just a series of questions like that I went through, like, OK, how much storage do I need? How fast do I need this to be?

188
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What services am I actually going to use? Do I need to optimize for Grafana and Node-RED?

189
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Do I really need to use those things or could I just get away with just home assistant and built in automations?

190
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And I kind of just decided simpler and lower power was better.

191
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And then I realized there's also all these benefits of the fact that because they're thirty five dollar computers, I can literally have a spec for spec spare sitting in a drawer.

192
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I can just pop right in. And so then I was like, well, all right.

193
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And I don't care if they melt, you know, change all kinds of stuff at that point.

194
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But initially, it was really just totally reassessing what are my actual performance requirements and being really honest with myself and realizing my family doesn't care if the stuff's not screaming fast, too.

195
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
We were talking about this just before we pressed the record button.

196
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
And, you know, let's take that 10 year lifespan of the pie as a great example.

197
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You think about how capable an x86 box was 10 years ago and you think about where the Raspberry Pi 4 is now as a line in the sand.

198
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And, you know, the Pi 4 is what, two years old at this point.

199
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So it's already a generation behind what the Pi 5 may or may not be.

200
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And I look at what that x86 box gave me and the size of hard drives, you know, I can get 16, 18, 20 terabytes in a single external drive now.

201
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That used to be my entire server more than 10 years ago.

202
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And yes, I know video sizes are bigger and et cetera, et cetera, and what have you.

203
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But this speaks to your point, Chris, is that there is a cost to everything.

204
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And if you want to hoard all the TV shows that God created, there is a cost to that.

205
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You know, not just in the number of platters that you need to have spinning, but obviously the energy required to have those platters spinning 24-7.

206
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
So, you know, you can save quite a bit just by doing things like S3 sleep with your server.

207
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You know, obviously if you do that, you have to bear in mind there's going to be some latency when you press play in Plex or Kodi or whatever it is,

208
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
whilst the server wakes up and realizes what's going on and de-grogs itself.

209
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But, you know, the other thing you could do is try starting small, small improvements.

210
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Like I said before, change your hard drive density or do things like hard drive spin down, that kind of thing, and just do the low hanging fruit first,

211
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
see what difference that makes and then optimize from there.

212
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Linode.com slash SSH.

213
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support this here show.

214
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So what is Linode?

215
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Well, I'm glad you asked.

216
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

217
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You got to go try it for yourself.

218
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's what we use for everything we've built that's hosted in the cloud for the last two and a half years.

219
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You want to try something like a research project, you want to learn something, push a machine.

220
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Linode systems are great for that.

221
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
They're super fast.

222
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
They got 40 gigabit connections coming into them hypervisors and they got 11 data centers all over this here world.

223
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
So you can pick something close to you.

224
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And then, I mean, if you're a crazy cat and why not, because you're rolling in there with $100 in credit,

225
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
you can try out their new MVME PCIe storage.

226
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:30,000
MVME PCIe storage, local repo caches in their data center, 40 gigabit connections to the hypervisor, AMD epic CPUs for the high end CPU systems.

227
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You see what I'm saying about performance?

228
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's wild over there.

229
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So you got to go check it out if you're a performance hound.

230
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But if you just want something straightforward, maybe you're not a large business.

231
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Maybe you don't need a ton of performance.

232
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Maybe you just have, I don't know, a portfolio you want to run online or a GitLab instance, for goodness sake, like a good lad.

233
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
They got systems over there that will do that for you, too.

234
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Systems are like five bucks a month.

235
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Pricing is 30% to 50% cheaper than those big duopoly hyperscalers that want to lock you into their cray-cray platform that's totally weird and unique to them.

236
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
They don't do that over at Linode.

237
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And if you ever need any help, they got the best supports.

238
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
24 sevens.

239
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I mean, I wouldn't do it, but I think you could even call them on Christmas and I think they'd answer the phone.

240
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Maniacs.

241
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You know, maybe somebody gets paid extra special.

242
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Maybe they get Santa's cookies that day.

243
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't know what they do, but somehow Linode covers the gap.

244
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:35,000
They got great support, great performance, tons of options, a beautiful UI, a dashboard that tells you the info you need to know about your system right when you look at it.

245
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And so much more.

246
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But I suppose why not put it over the top?

247
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Could support the show.

248
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Keep us going and get $100 in credit.

249
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
That's Linode.com slash SSH.

250
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So Christian writes in my basement flooded last week, and I've been looking for the best leak detection sensor.

251
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
And I was wondering if there's anything that either of you would recommend that's Wi-Fi based.

252
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I know there are some Zigbee and Z wave options, but specifically I'm hoping for Wi-Fi.

253
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Thanks, Christian.

254
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Very good.

255
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I absolutely do recommend a few Z wave devices.

256
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But you know, I think I know I'm not sure if it's Wi-Fi or not.

257
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Gosh, Wi-Fi, Alex, you know, any of off the top of your head that are good Wi-Fi devices?

258
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I don't.

259
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And I think the problem with the Wi-Fi in that situation is just the energy usage.

260
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Unless you're going to leave the water sensor plugged in all the time, which if it's a water sensor, you probably don't want to do.

261
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Wi-Fi is just too power hungry.

262
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I know that in my attic right now and underneath my air conditioning unit, I have one of those Aotech water leak sensors that Zigbee.

263
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And that just plugs straight into Home Assistant using the Conbee too.

264
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That works perfect.

265
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That's the one I recommend.

266
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
If you are a ring user, ring actually makes a water sensor.

267
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
That's Z wave, but ring manages all the Z wave stuffs for you.

268
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
So maybe that's easier.

269
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I don't know.

270
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But honestly, for this kind of thing, this, if you could, really is the chance to get into something like Z wave or Zigbee, get the stick and do that kind of stuff.

271
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But if you know of a better way with Wi-Fi, I'd totally love to know, especially if it does work with Home Assistant.

272
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Let us know at self hosted dot show slash contact or even better.

273
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Send us a boost with a new podcast app that supports value for value at new podcast apps dot com.

274
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I thought we'd go for a little trip down memory lane here with some interesting Raspberry Pi projects.

275
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And one of my first ever Raspberry Pi projects use cases was actually this was before I got the Nvidia Shield and I was still on the hunt for a media center PC.

276
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I used to have an actual computer as my home theater PC like a madman.

277
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And along came the Raspberry Pi with its MPEG2 hardware decoder.

278
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And I threw something called Raspbmc on it, which was written by a chap called Sam Nazarko at the time, which was just an XBMC kind of build for the original Raspberry Pi.

279
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,000
In my opinion, especially like with the Pi three, this was the use case, the use case for me.

280
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Like it wasn't server ready, the early pies, but the use case was XBMC, Kodi and hooking it up to the television.

281
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The other use case, funny enough, also involved hooking it up to a screen and HDMI is I know my buddy Noah would go around and put them on the back of monitors and studio and use them for countdown clocks and like IRC chat room dedicated systems.

282
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And the beauty was it's just just the monitor because the Raspberry Pi would be like taped duct tape to the back of the screen.

283
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And it's great for that kind of stuff to just like drive a display.

284
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And so obviously Raspbmc became morphed into open source media center, OSMC, and they have now got their own website and a whole bunch of hardware that they offer, you know, specifically cases, generally speaking for the Raspberry Pis.

285
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But I saw an interesting thing on Kickstarter this week.

286
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It is a bit old, but I think they're starting to actually ship units now it was from late last year.

287
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The people that make the Argon case, they've made a new NAS case called the Eon. What do you think of this?

288
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
This is too cool. I mean, this is seriously too cool for school.

289
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
This looks like some Cylon system from Battlestar Galactica, like really cool looking.

290
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
This has got to be the sleekest case ever.

291
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
OK, so let me let me walk you through it.

292
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:53,000
This thing has space for four SATA hard drives for some reason they can only take two three and a half and two two and a half hard drives.

293
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Because of the shape of the enclosure, it doesn't make any sense to me either.

294
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I see you pulling a face at the other end.

295
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yeah, they call it a cyberpunk inspired design with space grade aluminum.

296
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's in a triangular tower shape with a metal bottom and dark black glass sides with metal trim.

297
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And then the pie goes in the bottom section and then the hard drives, they go in the top of the stack vertically.

298
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So you imagine a triangle tower that goes up and then there's SATA hard drives that slide in top like a toaster oven

299
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
and plug into a little SATA daughter card that is then hooked back into a Raspberry Pi.

300
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Well, it looks great if they made a version that fit for three and a half inch hard drives.

301
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:50,000
This would pretty much be the perfect low power energy prices are going through the roof home now, wouldn't it?

302
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yeah, the only downside is and I do appreciate the build of materials here is more expensive than your average bear.

303
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But the dang things like on the low end, seven hundred and thirty dollars without the Raspberry Pi.

304
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
That's the only gotcha, right? Is you take something that is such a beautiful budget machine.

305
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
And after you add pie and drives, you're like sitting at fifteen hundred dollars all in.

306
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,000
OK, that's that's a bit of an unclearable obstacle.

307
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Jesus, seven hundred and thirty dollars. I didn't see that.

308
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Then again, if you're if you're shopping for low power, you know, if you put solid states in this thing,

309
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,000
it would be a pretty low power NAS. And so that initial upfront cost these days may be justifiable

310
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,000
if, you know, over a five year period, the power drives. Eighty percent less than an equivalent PC NAS.

311
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Maybe, but you have to keep it for five years. You can't get bored after two and then buy something else.

312
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Yeah, you know, the five is just around the corner, too, and you probably have to throw out the whole bottom end of this thing.

313
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Exactly. This is actually what the compute module is perfect for.

314
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:12,000
And I think the compute module for me, the Raspberry Pi four compute module, the CM, as they call it, takes it to the whole next level.

315
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Right. Because you get much more connectivity with these carrier boards.

316
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,000
You get PCI slots potentially. You can get SATA ports potentially.

317
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
This one that I've been experimenting with, it has dual PCI gigabit NICs on the carrier board.

318
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
So that I feel like the compute module is really where this kind of this Argon pie NAS,

319
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
what it really should be is the carrier. It should be its own carrier board with these SATA ports and everything.

320
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And then you open up the bottom and you pop in a CM four or CM five or whatever it is.

321
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Right. Absolutely. As long as it's future proofed for at least, I don't know, three, four generations of pie, something.

322
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Well, you know, maybe if they made the if they made the carrier board module or modular or something, because they don't.

323
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I mean, how do they know if maybe the Raspberry Pi folks decide they change the interface?

324
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Although probably not. I bet you it's something they remain pretty consistent on.

325
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I hope so, because you look at the GPIO pins and they've been remarkably unchanged.

326
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But they haven't changed at all since the very first pie. Yeah. Even with the zeros.

327
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Yeah. Yeah. So it's potential. I think it has real potential.

328
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I don't think the accessory market and the high end enthusiast market has wrapped its head around the CM four yet,

329
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
just because of the supply chain shortage is so hard to get them. They're too hard to get.

330
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Yeah, I won't build a pie based server system without the CM four.

331
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Now, that's the only way I'm going to build these. I'm not going to use a standard Raspberry Pi for carrier board anymore.

332
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And you can also get some of these with EMMC on there. So you're not stuck to using dumb old SD cards.

333
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It's like everything I've always wanted in a Raspberry Pi.

334
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So let me ask you a question. What's your body count of pies right now?

335
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Well, I mean, I definitely have five or six Raspberry Pies.

336
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And then I have two CM fours, which I felt silly when I bought them, my CM fours.

337
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm like, I don't really need these right now. And now I'm so glad I have all these because I'm not going to get any for a while.

338
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It sounds like maybe even another couple of years really before supplies return to normal.

339
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
And I love them. I think I have about the same number.

340
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I know I mocked you in a previous episode for having too many and we staged a pie intervention,

341
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
but I've got two pie fours on two 3D printers.

342
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I've got another one running my DNS. I've got another one in the UK doing backup stuff at my sister's house.

343
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I've got seven Raspberry Pies. Now I think about it, you know, we ought to do right.

344
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Bring them all together. Giant pie cluster.

345
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
You know, this is something actually that I didn't put in the show notes,

346
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
but now I'm going to talk about it is the use case for Raspberry Pies as Kubernetes clusters.

347
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Yeah, like compute units. Right. Forgive me, but I don't get it.

348
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:13,000
It's it's about training in my opinion, maybe, but then you're running arm code and it's always a bit hit and miss.

349
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,000
No, no, no. I think you got to I think you got to think about it, Alex, from like the whole base principles,

350
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:31,000
like just grasping provisioning devices at scale, like just maybe because I'll tell you why I say this is I had a buddy who had like one of these.

351
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You've probably seen these these pie racks that you got like a dozen pies and like acrylic rack badass.

352
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
And I really want one. I know it looks. Yeah. And I was like, so what do you got this for?

353
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I mean, obviously it's a conversation starter, right?

354
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
And he was starting just starting some training course on learning Kubernetes and all of that.

355
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And being able to provision all of those machines right there by clicking some buttons,

356
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
it like it totally wrapped his head around what it was he was learning.

357
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
It like it made it all real for him. And, you know, he doesn't do it on Raspberry Pi's anymore.

358
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I've always thought, you know, just spin up 30 VMS who needs all the hardware.

359
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But if you got the pies laying around, it is a fun project.

360
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:23,000
That was always my argument was, you know, one x86 box could replace 40 Raspberry Pi's.

361
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:30,000
But yeah, there is a bare metal angle to provisioning Raspberry Pi's and picture booting and all sorts of, you know,

362
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
all sorts of fun stuff you can do with with them. So, I mean, there is a use case like my grandmother used to say,

363
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
turn off that damn light. What do you got stock in the electric company?

364
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
You know, there is that angle now, too. It's a whole new world.

365
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
I have a bit of a fun story to share on the show, which I've been meaning to tell for a little while.

366
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
It's only a little one about the genesis of the Heimdallr Docker dashboard.

367
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:02,000
So back in, I don't know, three, four, five years ago, something like that, when I was still with Linux server,

368
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
one of the devs over there, Cody, who's actually the lead dev behind fanart.tv.

369
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I said to him one morning on IRC, I'd love it if we had a single app that I could load

370
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,000
that just had a bunch of icons with each of my containers running on it,

371
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
but was also smart enough to figure out which containers were actually running and talk a little bit to them

372
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,000
and just show me a couple of nuggets of data about each app. And that single idea spawned Heimdallr.

373
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So, I mean, I'm not going to claim total credit for Heimdallr because he wrote the thing.

374
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But that idea was actually stolen from an internal Red Hat system that we have called Rover,

375
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
which is just a bunch of icons on a screen, and you can pin favorites and that kind of thing.

376
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I thought, you know, that would be pretty cool if I had that for my home server.

377
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And since then, there have been a proliferation of home dashboards that we see all over the self hosted subreddit all the time.

378
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
People love their dashboards over there. Oh, my God.

379
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,000
They should have a no dashboard filter and take out probably 70 percent of the content.

380
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And I've actually just recently decided I'm going to break down and do this, not so much for myself necessarily,

381
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,000
but actually for the for the spouse so that she has a bookmark she can go to and figure out what's going on when I'm not around.

382
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Yes. Super important in getting my father on board with it when I set his server up for him last summer because I did a Homer dashboard.

383
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And for him, he doesn't really want to have to learn the nuances of all the different domain names I set up for him.

384
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
So for him, he just goes to home dot domain.

385
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And that's all he has to remember is just to type home into the address bar and up it comes.

386
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
And then all of the services are just there as a nice icon.

387
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
There are lots of others that I've used over the years.

388
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Flame stands out as being a good one. This one is quite minimalist.

389
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It's just a bunch of text links that you can customize with absolutely no interactivity whatsoever.

390
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
But it's it's quite pleasing to look at.

391
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Another one that's quite popular is organizer. And this one puts stuff behind a bunch of different tabs effectively within a single tab.

392
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
So you've basically got a list of icons on the left hand side and then each app you can just click through and scroll through.

393
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:26,000
And, you know, I I still find myself after all these years, I've set up several of these dashboards, including Heimdallr, including Homer.

394
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
And eventually they they kind of suffer from technical debt and configuration drift.

395
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
And they don't end up reflecting reality.

396
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:47,000
And this is where Flame comes in as being particularly nice is it actually hooks into your Docker engine and live updates based on what the containers you have actually running are, which is it's a killer feature.

397
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Hmm.

398
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Tailscale dot com slash self hosted, go there to get a free personal account for up to 20 devices.

399
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And of course, your support in the show.

400
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Yeah, I'm talking about Tailscale, the zero config VPN that installs on any device you got in minutes.

401
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Easy to manage your firewall rules for you.

402
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Easy to work from home.

403
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Easy to access your stuff from anywhere.

404
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
This is the solution I finally went with to get to my treasure trove of information in lady tubes.

405
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Like when I first started setting up my documentation and on my offline repository of information, I opted to just not even bother with the VPN thing.

406
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Because even even traditional WireGuard, I just wasn't super happy with it.

407
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Not only do I have carrier grade net, but I needed something that I could get up and go on a new system kind of just spontaneously without really any pre-planning.

408
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And Tailscale has nailed that.

409
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
It lets my devices connect directly to each other.

410
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:55,000
It uses WireGuard's noise protocol encryption, and you build your own mesh network using the best VPN security stuff in the biz.

411
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:01,000
You can quickly and easily create a secure network between your servers, computers, and your cloud instances.

412
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I got a message from mom last night about something wrong with a service she was connecting to while I was home.

413
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:16,000
I flipped on Tailscale, connected to the system here in the studio that she was trying to use, and I fixed the problem from the couch in 10 seconds.

414
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I mean, maybe it's been a month since I had to use it on my iPhone, but it was so great to be able to immediately put my iPhone on that mesh network and get access to those systems.

415
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And it just worked flawlessly.

416
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So I've got it on iPhones, I've got it on my Raspberry Pis, I've got it on x86 servers.

417
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I love it for all of that stuff.

418
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Just a stable IP for all my systems.

419
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
No matter where I'm at, it stays consistent.

420
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:49,000
And the devices only connect after you sign them through your own identity provider, whatever that might be.

421
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So you can easily enforce multi-factor authentication.

422
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
You can deauthorize machines without having to get to that machine if somebody's moved on, etc.

423
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
So it's really flexible in that way.

424
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And because I know that these are always on VPNs, I know that it's always there.

425
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It's always there for me.

426
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And they have super DNS friendly stuff in there.

427
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So you can add a DNS server to your Tailscale network and have some real magic.

428
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It's dead simple to use.

429
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
And it's something I use every single day.

430
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
You're going to love it.

431
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm sure you've probably heard about it.

432
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Now's the chance to sign up, support the show, and get up to 20 machines free at tailscale.com slash self-hosted.

433
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I just had a proper next level, I'm living in the future moment.

434
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
As we were recording, I just heard it start raining.

435
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And I was smoking a picana, which is like a topside of sirloin earlier this afternoon.

436
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And I thought, did I leave something outside on the deck?

437
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
So I just bring up Blue Iris in the browser as we were recording, have a quick look, and then message my wife and say,

438
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Can you please save my wood chips I left outside and my smokers stuff?

439
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
You know, seriously, the camera systems, I haven't talked about it a lot recently.

440
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
But I still find it really useful to have on my system.

441
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It was over a month ago when the temperatures just crashed here in Washington.

442
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
We had a rat get in lady tubes and we suspected there was a rat.

443
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
But having that, I had a camera detector motion event, which got a snapshot of the rat.

444
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Like, you know, just because that kind of confirmation.

445
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Is that why you asked me about rats in the show?

446
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I was so confused at the time.

447
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
What did I?

448
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Yes.

449
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Probably had rats on the brain.

450
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
I got that little guy to let me tell you.

451
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Oh, but not after inflicted serious damage on lady tubes.

452
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Wiring damage.

453
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
We have a listener, Listener Cole, who's coming up to the junkyard this weekend to help us do some fixes.

454
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
We did.

455
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
We did some bypassing.

456
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
But yeah, yeah, so I'm glad.

457
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,000
But I'm glad I had that camera in there because I knew I had to take action immediately.

458
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You know, damn.

459
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Well, on a happier note, Lucas writes in.

460
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I have a pie running regular backups from my server via our snapshot.

461
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Some time ago, the backup wasn't working and I didn't notice for a few weeks.

462
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Do you have any suggestions on monitoring that backup?

463
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm thinking of something that reads the R snapshot logs, sends me an email maybe in case of an error.

464
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Thanks for the feedback.

465
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Love the show.

466
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Greetings from Germany, Lucas.

467
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Hmm.

468
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Seems like there's so many options here and I'm going to resist the temptation to recommend something else entirely like like Borg backup or something else.

469
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
So I'll let you answer this.

470
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Well, I think the obvious one for me is something like health checks.io.

471
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So what this does is when you run a cron job, you append to the end of your script or your bash command that you're putting into cron a little curl with a UUID in it.

472
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
So curl HTTPS URL slash and then you put your little UUID in there.

473
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:06,000
And what that does is it pings the health check server and says, hey, this this job just ran. And what you can then do is configure timeouts to say, right, I want this job to run every day.

474
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And the grace period is six hours because sometimes a backup can take six hours to complete.

475
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
So it reduces the noise and the false positives you might get there sometimes.

476
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:26,000
But the other really cool thing you can do and some of the guys in our discord have been experimenting with health checks a lot of which there is a self hosted version, by the way, as well.

477
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Don't be confused and think it's just a service. It's not.

478
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:37,000
What you can also do is put a slash start at the beginning of your script to that same URL with the UUID as well.

479
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
And then you can monitor how long specific jobs take.

480
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,000
So you can look and say, oh, my backups on average take two minutes, 30 seconds.

481
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,000
This one took four hours. Why is that? And then you can go and look at the logs because you can append logs to health checks as well.

482
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
If you didn't know that, you can use curl to do that as well.

483
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:09,000
So, I mean, for me, yes, you could go and, you know, reinvent the wheel and have something that does log passing and alert manager with Prometheus and get as complex as you like.

484
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But really, for me, keep it simple because if you don't, it'll just you just won't keep on top of it if it's a personal system.

485
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yep. Yep. And if it's going to send you an alert, make sure it's sending you an alert somewhere you're actually checking and that you won't just ignore that doesn't just end up in some folder on Gmail or something like that.

486
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
All right. Well, our next email comes in from Norm.

487
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Norm writes in. Hey, guys, love the show. Self-hosted alone is making me want to purchase a membership to support you. Thank you, Norm.

488
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Self-hosted dot show slash SRE for this show or Jupiter Party for all the shows.

489
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Independent podcasting needs support more than ever.

490
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
He says, I have two questions and one more than more than the other.

491
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
All right. So let's start with the important one.

492
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:06,000
He says in your failing at scale episode, you brought up Home Assistant and breaking changes with Z-Wave, Z-Wave JS, etc. You also mentioned waiting for matter, something that I've been considering as well.

493
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Would you mind giving your opinion on if someone should wait for a matter if they have zero Z-Wave devices yet?

494
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I've been considering getting some, but I haven't pulled the trigger yet and I'm wondering if I should wait.

495
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Ah, the age old question, should I buy now or should I wait?

496
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
The thing about matter is certainly for the moment, at least.

497
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And with the chip shortage, I expect this to continue into the foreseeable future is right now it's vaporware.

498
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So you would be waiting for a set of promises that are coming at some point in the future.

499
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I know people have said it's going to be in twenty two, but who knows?

500
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So if you need something now, buy it now. It's like buying a graphics card or a laptop or anything like that or a car.

501
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:01,000
If you need something now, buy it now. If you're just tinkering, buy maybe a minimum viable set of Z-Wave devices so you can get your feet wet.

502
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:08,000
And then you really go whole hog into the matter stuff when it does finally land. What are your thoughts?

503
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Yeah, I pretty much agree. I'll put a link in the show notes to an article that kind of goes over what you can expect is going to remain compatible.

504
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Here's the thing about matter. It's basically ZigBee. It's based on ZigBee.

505
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:29,000
So it is very likely that some ZigBee devices will be software updatable to matter devices.

506
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
So that's something to keep in mind. That might just be what you need.

507
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
But Norm, I'm also going to put a link in here about some devices you can buy now that should be compatible.

508
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Something else you consider another route, depending on what device you're looking for, is if you're already an iOS house, you could just go for HomeKit compatibility.

509
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,000
That'll work over Wi-Fi. HomeKit is a stable interface to Home Assistant. It actually works pretty well.

510
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:01,000
But not all cases. Some HomeKit devices require special Bluetooth adapters or something like that.

511
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:06,000
So just be careful there. And I'd say, like Alex said, just buy now. Don't wait.

512
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And I would err on the side of ZigBee devices myself if I were having to repurchase right now. That's what my personal choice would be.

513
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And don't cheap out on the ZigBee bridge if you're going to do that. I tried with the Sonoff CC20 something, something, something, and then replaced it almost immediately with the ConBee 2 bridge.

514
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And since then, my automations and ZigBee devices have been 99.9% reliable, which really is great.

515
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:41,000
My Hue bridge, I unplugged it a few weeks ago, and it was a really nice moment in my life just to be able to go, nope, don't need this anymore. Goodbye.

516
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Yeah, that is nice. That is really nice. I think a lot of the large brands are going to offer this where I would do my research.

517
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Norm is I would research what ZigBee controller may be upgradable to matter if possible.

518
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And I would also look at what home smart manufactured people are already in the matter alliance.

519
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
There's a lot of them that are in there, so they're likely going to support it down the road.

520
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:14,000
But such a crappy time for the part shortage and such a crappy time to be forced to upgrade the Z-Wave stuff.

521
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Now, to be clear, Z-Wave is still 100% viable.

522
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And if you installed Home Assistant, you know, even like I think within the last year, you're going to be able to use Z-Wave JS and you're going to be fine.

523
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You're going to be golden because Z-Wave JS is well supported.

524
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:39,000
The particular problem that I and many early Home Assistant users have run into is that the migration to Z-Wave JS went real bad, real bad.

525
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:46,000
It's one of the few times I had to hit the old eject button and go back and restore an image real bad.

526
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:54,000
And I am not going to make that transition most likely without completely redoing my Home Assistant set up,

527
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,000
because you have to realize that this transition when I migrate is going to be a lot worse for me than somebody who's just setting up today.

528
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
If you're just setting up today, it's going to be painless.

529
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
If you're me, every single device gets a new name.

530
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
All the old devices remain, but they're no longer functional.

531
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Every device shows up with a brand new name, a new ID, top to bottom.

532
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,000
That means every automation, every script, every trigger, everything that refers to a device anywhere.

533
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Every button, everything has to be touched.

534
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
It's as bad as redoing the entire thing from scratch.

535
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
And I'm just not going to do that.

536
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
And so I just wish the timing could have been different.

537
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I understand the Home Assistant team needs to move on with Python.

538
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I don't advocate staying on old versions of Python.

539
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And I realize that this version of Z-Wave has been unsupported for a while.

540
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And Z-Wave devices are still good.

541
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
The Z-Wave JS implementation on Home Assistant is great.

542
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:00,000
So you could absolutely go the direction of Z-Wave today and be happy and probably have no problems and use them for years.

543
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,000
It just happens to be that I got bit as an early adopter, and now I'm kind of in a stuck position.

544
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Me and thousands of other users.

545
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
OK, his second question is really about LadyJupes, which, yes, he's correct, is my RV.

546
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Jupes as in Jupiter.

547
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
The last episode said that Home Assistant is integral and necessary to the RV.

548
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I'd love to hear a detailed rundown of your setup and devices.

549
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Thanks and keep up the great work, Norm.

550
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
That could be an entire episode, Alex.

551
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I was just thinking the same thing.

552
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Yeah, we should go into that.

553
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
You know what would be a fun one is when you're actually here.

554
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Sometime next time you're in the Pacific Northwest.

555
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Yes, all right, we'll do that.

556
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Put that in the back pocket and keep it there.

557
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Maybe we'll be on the road and we could do that episode from the RV.

558
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
That would be really great, too.

559
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I like that.

560
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
We'll put that one in the back pocket for sure.

561
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
So we'd love to hear from you.

562
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Self-hosted show slash contact questions, topic ideas, projects you think we should know about or look into,

563
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:06,000
and your ideas on ways to save power and still have a lot of fun with home self-hosting or even small business self-hosting.

564
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Let us know.

565
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Self-hosted show slash contact.

566
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Both Alex and I do try to check that inbox.

567
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,000
So again, it is self-hosted dot show slash contact and thank you to our SREs out there,

568
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
our subscribers who make the show possible.

569
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
As a thank you, we're giving you a post-show.

570
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm not sure what we're going to talk about.

571
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I know we talked, we brainstormed earlier, so we have several possible post-show topics,

572
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
but we'll have to just pick.

573
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
We'll pick a good one.

574
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
It's about the price of fish.

575
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
I don't think it's going to be the price of fish actually.

576
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And the plight at third world.

577
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
That's a quote from one of my favorite British film four movies.

578
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Well, there you go.

579
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Also, you can become a network member.

580
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:52,000
A network member supports all the shows for like the cost of two memberships and you get access to self-hosted and the post-show.

581
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
You get Linux action news, totally ad free.

582
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
You get the Linux unplugged live stream, which is like two Linux shows in one.

583
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
You get Koda radio ad free, all of it at Jupiter.party.

584
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
It's a great way to support independent podcasting.

585
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Don't forget meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for all the details for our fantastical East Coast mystery tour meetup.

586
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
It's coming on April 9th.

587
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I would love to see you there.

588
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
You can find me on Twitter at ironic Badger.

589
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Pew pew, Chris and Badger go to the park.

590
