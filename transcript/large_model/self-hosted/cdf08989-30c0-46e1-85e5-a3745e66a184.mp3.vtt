00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
Coming up this week, Chris and I share some of our top tips for getting started with self-hosting

00:04.800 --> 00:09.520
and we cover some network basics and we definitely don't talk about Home Assistant.

00:09.520 --> 00:13.840
Promise. I'm Alex. I'm Chris and this is Self-Hosted 17.

00:15.120 --> 00:19.920
Well, hello, Alex. Welcome to Self-Hosted 17. Did you have to turn off the 3D printers for

00:19.920 --> 00:25.520
this episode? I did, yeah. I've just about got to my thousandth head shield, face shield thing

00:25.520 --> 00:30.240
and I've got another printer that's been donated by somebody else. There are two more downstairs,

00:30.240 --> 00:33.520
so I've got five in the house now. So your house is really a manufacturing plant,

00:33.520 --> 00:37.680
is what you're saying? Yeah, it's kind of crazy. I'm kind of done. I'm so bored of 3D printing.

00:37.680 --> 00:42.240
I bet. I bet. I wonder if you're going to have to take a break after this. You know what? Just ship

00:42.240 --> 00:48.720
them up here. Well, I was going to take one of them with me to Linux Fest Northwest, but sadly...

00:49.600 --> 00:54.400
No, that's not happening. So did you end up watching old Picard off my Plex server last

00:54.400 --> 01:00.400
night? Not yet, no. Well, we do have a little Plex news regardless. You and I, being Plex buddies,

01:01.120 --> 01:05.120
will often talk each other into a show and then just say, yeah, go watch it off my Plex.

01:06.400 --> 01:10.720
The one I've been watching this week is The Tiger King, which is actually on Netflix,

01:10.720 --> 01:14.960
not Plex. Everybody's been watching Tiger King. I can't believe that dude is real.

01:14.960 --> 01:20.480
Oh, I can. I can just because I've seen some crazy stuff just in the podcasting space,

01:20.480 --> 01:25.040
so I can only imagine that getting amped up in the Tiger Zoo-ing space.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.080
Because you wouldn't believe some of the things I've seen.

01:28.080 --> 01:32.320
There are niches for people within niches within niches. And these guys,

01:32.960 --> 01:37.440
there's like a clique of three of them and they're all at each other's throats the whole time.

01:38.000 --> 01:43.520
But anyway, we digress slightly. The Plex news this week is they've released a couple of apps.

01:43.520 --> 01:49.600
One of them is called Plex Dash. And this thing, if you've ever looked at the dashboard on your

01:49.600 --> 01:56.240
Plex server, I think it came out maybe a year ago. You can see who is streaming what from your server

01:56.240 --> 02:00.880
and how much CPU is being used and a basic history of your most popular content.

02:00.880 --> 02:06.640
Well, they've brought this now to an Android and I think iOS app, which you can install on your phone.

02:07.280 --> 02:11.840
And I kind of like it. It's pretty bare bones compared to something like Taotuli,

02:11.840 --> 02:16.320
which is another alternative in this space. But, you know, it does the job.

02:16.320 --> 02:20.800
Yeah, and having a built in is really nice. What got my attention, though, in the recent

02:20.800 --> 02:26.800
Plex news was the announcement of Plex AMP version three, which I think is going to kill

02:27.440 --> 02:32.080
prism on my mobile device, which is what I used in the past to stream my Plex music.

02:32.080 --> 02:36.720
This app is impressive. They're using Opus on the back end to get really high quality

02:36.720 --> 02:42.560
audio streaming in certain conditions. It's pre caching upcoming tracks. I wish every

02:42.560 --> 02:46.320
freaking music player on mobile would. And the interface looks really good, too.

02:46.960 --> 02:52.240
And, you know, one of the number one questions we get into this show is how can I self host

02:52.240 --> 02:57.360
my music collection? And not everybody likes it. They really, really don't like it sometimes when

02:57.360 --> 03:02.480
we say Plex. But this is the sort of thing that Plex does that other projects can't quite match.

03:02.480 --> 03:08.320
And for those of us that use Plex to manage like myself, this is what I do. I manage my audiobooks

03:08.320 --> 03:15.680
and my music collection on Plex. Audio books work kind of OK. There's a checkbox you can set

03:15.680 --> 03:21.600
in the Plex settings to remember last listened position. The only problem is if you have your

03:21.600 --> 03:26.800
book split up into chapters, if you get to more than 80 percent in a chapter or is it 90 percent,

03:26.800 --> 03:32.000
it considers the video or the audio track as watched. So if you're in that last couple of

03:32.000 --> 03:38.080
minutes of a chapter, you will lose your place, which is kind of annoying. And it's been a really

03:38.080 --> 03:44.080
good request of mine on the Plex pass get to vote on features. I think I asked for like six years

03:44.080 --> 03:49.760
ago. So come on, Plex. Let's do that. But to solve the audiobook problem, I actually use Booksonic

03:49.760 --> 03:55.200
and my wife devours audiobooks like a monster. And she loves Booksonic.

03:55.200 --> 03:59.040
The monsters? Are they are they known for devouring books? I think they're known for

03:59.040 --> 04:02.000
devouring other things. Don't question the analogy. OK.

04:03.360 --> 04:06.400
Yeah, I also think it's really good for Plex from an image standpoint to be

04:06.400 --> 04:10.800
seen doing these kinds of things because it counters that it's for piracy narrative

04:11.840 --> 04:16.560
that will have trickle down effects to MB and all of the other projects that we've talked about on

04:16.560 --> 04:22.400
the show, even even things like Cody, which aren't necessarily directly connected, but Plex taking

04:22.400 --> 04:27.520
this on and saying self-hosting for other things besides the stuff you downloaded off the Internet.

04:27.520 --> 04:33.040
It's really good for all these projects. And I'm not super keen on Plex Amp. I'm going to just put

04:33.040 --> 04:38.960
that out there. I think it looks beautiful. I use Prism currently, which is a third party app

04:38.960 --> 04:43.600
that is a really nice music player for Plex. So that's what it's up against.

04:43.600 --> 04:49.520
Yeah, I just I just found this a little confusing. Some of the design decisions they've made,

04:49.520 --> 04:54.960
if you look at the philosophy behind it, they say that applications should have a raise on detra.

04:54.960 --> 05:00.800
For Plex Amp version three, it came down to these. Play music fast and don't stop.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.880
And Elon argues in his Medium post, which we've linked in the show notes, that this sounds like

05:04.880 --> 05:09.520
a simplistic set of goals, but it actually informed a lot of their design decisions. And

05:09.520 --> 05:14.560
I don't really use Plex for music all that much. So I don't have a huge amount of data for it to

05:14.560 --> 05:18.800
sort of trawl through and look at my listening history, which I think might be counting against

05:18.800 --> 05:24.160
me here. Because when I click on stuff like artist radio for Tool, you know, a heavy metal band,

05:24.160 --> 05:30.960
it played My Name Is by Eminem, which isn't really what I would consider in the same genre,

05:32.080 --> 05:37.920
or even in the same multiverse as Tool. And then the next track it played me was a badly drawn boy

05:37.920 --> 05:44.240
track. So again, just weird. But I think maybe if people have a lot of database for it to mine

05:44.240 --> 05:49.280
data from, you know, history going back a couple of years, then it's probably going to do okay.

05:49.280 --> 05:54.160
See, for me, somebody that is often driving around in the Pacific Northwest, where we have large gaps

05:54.160 --> 05:58.640
of no coverage, because when you go through the forest and whatnot, having a music player that

05:58.640 --> 06:03.440
caches offline and pre-caches sort of closes those gaps, it's really nice.

06:03.440 --> 06:07.440
That bit's really cool. All right, and you can configure it up to 40 tracks, it says in the

06:07.440 --> 06:12.720
settings. It will pre-cache 40 tracks when it hits some connection for a few minutes,

06:12.720 --> 06:17.120
which I think is actually pretty cool. The interface as well is really nice. Like,

06:17.120 --> 06:22.240
I'm just going to show you on our cam. It renders out the waveform and then that's

06:22.240 --> 06:25.360
the progress bar. And that I really like too, because I'm an audio geek.

06:25.360 --> 06:29.520
Yeah, that's pretty cool. And look, it has potential. And this is something that Elan

06:29.520 --> 06:34.400
was telling us about when we interviewed him back on SSH, I don't know, Zero or whatever it was,

06:34.400 --> 06:39.120
a lot a while ago. It's got potential. Maybe I need to spend a bit more time with it. My initial

06:39.120 --> 06:44.240
reaction is, oh, this is a bit complicated compared to say, like Spotify or something. But

06:44.240 --> 06:48.640
over time, if I actually use it, I'll be interested to see how it kind of marinades

06:48.640 --> 06:56.000
and matures with my tastes. So I'm not going to write it off, but right now it's a bit weird.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.600
I like that they're doing it because it does make that answer when you tell people, well,

07:01.600 --> 07:05.920
Plex is something you could look at for self-hosting your music. There's a lot of

07:05.920 --> 07:09.600
solutions there, but only one or two of them are really worth your while. And I think Plex is one

07:09.600 --> 07:30.080
of them. And this just makes that a little bit more complete now. So if you want to find out a bit more about the kind of thought process behind how this application was created, there is a blog post from Elan from Plex in the show notes, both for Plex Dash and for Plex Amp. And take a look in the show notes.

07:30.080 --> 07:35.520
selfhosted.show slash 17. Now, Alex, will you join me over here in the home sys admin corner?

07:35.520 --> 08:04.320
Sure. Hold on. Let me just get my hat. Roll on over. I was talking with Brent yesterday about some basics of how to monitor cron jobs and understand how if you set up a bunch of automation on your home server, how do you know whether it's actually doing what you told it to in six months time? Because I'm not going to log in every day and check, you know, var log messages or whatever it is and see what's going on.

08:04.320 --> 08:34.240
And see whether my cron job silently failing or not. Well, enter health checks.io. It's billed as a simple and effective cron job monitoring solution that receives alerts when your nightly backup, your weekly reports and your cron jobs don't run on time. This is something a lot of sys admins might build into an enterprise system where they something I did just speaking from experience was would have mailboxes that all of the alerts would get sent to we would share that mailbox across the team and market red.

08:34.240 --> 08:41.760
But you had to check in on it because otherwise these things just silently message in your log and you are none the wiser.

08:41.760 --> 08:56.400
The way it works is really simple. You have your normal cron job as you normally would, and then you put an and and and then curl to a specific URL and that URL contains a token in it, which health checks knows is your token.

08:56.400 --> 09:14.000
And if it doesn't receive that ping within a certain time frame, you know, a week could be every day, whatever you configure it to, which is something you do in the settings, it will then send you an email and say, hey, this cron job is down. That's all it will do. It won't go and fix it for you, but it just alerts you that it's that it's down.

09:14.000 --> 09:25.040
The special sauce might be the interface to configure all of this. Like you said, how you can configure if it's been like this for a week or a day or an hour. That UI is you can almost describe it as beautiful.

09:25.040 --> 09:31.440
It is. And then it has one more trick up its sleeve, which is why we're talking about it. You can self-host it.

09:31.440 --> 09:46.800
Yes, self-hosting it is especially nice because someone like me who has everything behind my firewall, I can aggregate all of this in one spot. So I don't have to run health checks IO on each system. They all aggregate into one place and then I can sort it from there.

09:46.800 --> 09:53.040
And that behind my own land where nothing ever has to talk to the internet to do this is, well, that's just the sweet spot, Alex.

09:53.040 --> 10:14.640
Yeah, it's pretty great. It integrates with, I don't know, I'm trying to count. It must be like 25 different services, stuff like Telegram, WhatsApp, SMS, email, of course, Ops Genie, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Discord, Matrix, literally everything you could think of. This thing will be able to just send you a message. So I think it's really useful.

10:14.640 --> 10:42.560
I can't really underscore that enough because for me, it has to be somewhere that I am actively checking every day for me to see it. And so for work, often, I will pipe things into Slack because when I'm in work mode, I open up works Slack and I'm in there. And that's where I'll pipe messages I need to see. And I will go to the process of automating as many of those types of things as I can. Even emails from certain people. I know that sounds ridiculous, but certain emails I have set up to ping me in my work Slack.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.440
Oh, thank you. I'm glad you take my email so seriously.

10:45.440 --> 10:50.240
Of course. You're obviously, no, you're in my Mattermost. You get pinged in my Mattermost.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.240
Which you never open.

10:52.240 --> 10:58.640
Oh, right. No, I'm too busy on our Discord these days, which has been just crackalacking great.

10:58.640 --> 11:00.640
Oh, yeah, you got to plug the old Discord skis.

11:00.640 --> 11:20.640
Yeah, go to selfhosted.show slash Discord or we have a link up at the top of the self-hosted page. I just mentioned it because really cool community in there. And I'd put out a question recently on an episode, got some great answers in there. People were showing me some really nice arm boards that I'm drooling about these days.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.640
We're over 500 people on Discord already. Can you believe that?

11:23.640 --> 11:24.640
No, really?

11:24.640 --> 11:25.640
That's crazy.

11:25.640 --> 11:28.640
It does feel like a lot's going on in there, but in a good way.

11:28.640 --> 11:36.640
Yeah, I'm getting a lot of pings, which is fine. I mean, that's kind of why we set it up. But maybe I need to do some notification management soon.

11:36.640 --> 11:46.640
Yeah, I was on a work meeting call and I was getting the bloop bloop from Discord, bloop bloop. And I'm like, oh, yeah, right. That's that's the thing I got to know. I got to remember I got to turn that off.

11:46.640 --> 11:59.640
I had an ask SSH or SSH 101 request from Rob Moore at RM54x on Twitter. I'd like to be able to experiment with more of your topics if there was a baseline primer for beginners to get us up to speed.

11:59.640 --> 12:06.640
Maybe something like a domain or an SSL or reverse proxy walkthrough with maybe a video or screenshots.

12:06.640 --> 12:12.640
Something like a self-paced container bootcamp. Call it SSH 101 if you will. Thanks, Rob.

12:12.640 --> 12:18.640
I like the name SSH 101. Although most people outside the show would think that's probably something else entirely.

12:18.640 --> 12:22.640
Yes. Yeah, I'm a bit worried about that. So let's just call it self-hosted 101.

12:22.640 --> 12:26.640
Now, one of my previous projects that I was involved in quite heavily was Linux server IO.

12:26.640 --> 12:40.640
And one of the key things that we tried to do with that project was have really great documentation aimed at people who were not doing this for a day job, maybe, or were just getting into it to start with.

12:40.640 --> 12:46.640
There's a couple of links in the show notes to things that we hosted over at Linux server docs.linuxserver.io.

12:46.640 --> 12:57.640
There's a huge amount of information on there about how to do basic stuff like spin up a container or how to use Docker compose or understanding PUID and PGID.

12:57.640 --> 13:02.640
All that kind of stuff, which might sound a little bit complicated to get started with.

13:02.640 --> 13:08.640
It's all laid out there, I think, in a really clear way. There's not much documentation, but what's there is nice and simple.

13:08.640 --> 13:18.640
And the other one I recommend coming back to your reverse proxy question is the NGINX Let's Encrypt Starter Guide written by Aptalka on the Linux server blog.

13:18.640 --> 13:27.640
Back in April last year, Aptalka wrote probably the most comprehensive NGINX guide, I think, on the internet aimed at this segment of people.

13:27.640 --> 13:36.640
It's quite the lengthy read, but there's a lot of detailed information in there about how to configure NGINX, how to configure Let's Encrypt with that Docker image.

13:36.640 --> 13:46.640
And by the end of it, you should be in a position to have any service behind your firewall exposed through a reverse proxy with an SSL certificate for free.

13:46.640 --> 13:51.640
If I can't give you a better sales pitch than that, I don't know. But I think it's a great piece.

13:51.640 --> 13:59.640
You and I are also always talking about the possibility of doing some live stream walkthroughs or recording an extra thing here or there.

13:59.640 --> 14:12.640
We are also aware that there's a lot of already really well done stuff, which I think is the point Alex is just making on the internet, that we can be an aggregator for as well and point you in those directions and tell you, yes, this is a good one or no, that's a bad one.

14:12.640 --> 14:18.640
So that's also a role we can play in that. So it's a mix. And it's something we actually are talking about more and more these days.

14:18.640 --> 14:27.640
And I would really strongly encourage you to, no matter how simple it seems to you, to write it down in a public facing format.

14:27.640 --> 14:39.640
This is how I learn personally, I guess. So take it for what you will. But when I have to explain something to somebody else, that's when I learn, when I figure out how much I don't know about something generally.

14:39.640 --> 14:46.640
Absolutely. Once you learn how to explain something simply to someone else, you generally pretty fully understand it.

14:46.640 --> 14:55.640
And it's one of the metrics I use before I go on the air to explain a complicated subject is I try to see if I can distill it down into three key points.

14:55.640 --> 15:04.640
And I also the funny thing about writing it down online is every now and then you'll do Google search and you'll come across your own post. Has that happened to you?

15:04.640 --> 15:08.640
That's funny when that happens. Also annoying.

15:08.640 --> 15:14.640
Yes. Oh, man, am I really that? Oh, geez. All right. Well, let's go read what I said.

15:14.640 --> 15:31.640
I have been experimenting with various kinds of arm boards recently, as you know, and I just thought while we're talking about beginner hardware, I want to give a mention that with the release of Ubuntu 2004 long term support.

15:31.640 --> 15:39.640
They are officially supporting the Raspberry Pi 4 64 bit version, and it's really good.

15:39.640 --> 15:47.640
Oh, if you're looking at running server services on a Raspberry Pi Raspians, I think a very good desktop distribution.

15:47.640 --> 15:55.640
But I think Ubuntu LTS may have it slightly beat because not only do you have live patching, but you also have if you want.

15:55.640 --> 16:05.640
You can I think for five machines do landscape canonicals management solution, which is a nice way to centrally manage and audit your servers, which is what I'm going to do.

16:05.640 --> 16:11.640
When I get all of them on 2004 is I'm going to enroll all of them in landscape and manage them that way.

16:11.640 --> 16:17.640
Now, that being said, Alex, can you guess what I have in my hot little hands right now?

16:17.640 --> 16:22.640
Can you guess what that is? Get any guesses? Sounds like a doorstop.

16:22.640 --> 16:28.640
It is the aluminum housing with a built in heat sink for the Pine 64 Rock Pro 64.

16:28.640 --> 16:34.640
Oh, yeah. And I've been doing some experiments with that little board recently.

16:34.640 --> 16:36.640
Oh, yeah. This week's luck was really good.

16:36.640 --> 16:49.640
That was so much fun with you. I don't know how much of it made it into the final edit, but at one point you spun up 10,000 simultaneous connections from three separate geolocations to the Pine 64 to see what it could handle.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.640
And it did really well.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.640
I used Xpane to do that.

16:53.640 --> 17:05.640
Carl George put me onto it. And so Chris had this little ASCII art text version of Star Wars, which I was probably Wes actually, not you, but Wes set this thing up on the Rock Pro. Is it the Rock Pro 64? Is that what it's called?

17:05.640 --> 17:09.640
Yeah. And it was just a Docker container. There's several different ones out there.

17:09.640 --> 17:11.640
We linked to it in the show notes so you can run other movies as well.

17:11.640 --> 17:23.640
And this thing is special because it has an NVMe SSD in it, which is one of the big criticisms that you can level against the Pi really is that it's really, really hamstrung by that SD card these days.

17:23.640 --> 17:28.640
Yes, very much so. Very much so. And even then, you're still limited in your options.

17:28.640 --> 17:41.640
So what I've done with Ubuntu 20.04 on the Raspberry Pi 4 is to avoid that SD bandwidth limitation, which is just horrendous. On Ubuntu 20.04's kernel, you can now boot from a USB device.

17:41.640 --> 17:47.640
You can load from the USB device. So I do that now. The kernel looks for a disk label.

17:47.640 --> 17:51.640
That disk label is on the USB drive instead of the SD card, and it boots from that.

17:51.640 --> 17:57.640
And it's as simple as that. And it's significantly faster, but it's still USB three speeds.

17:57.640 --> 18:05.640
That's where the Rock Pro 64 has a little bit of special sauce for self hosting because it has a PCIe 4X slot.

18:05.640 --> 18:14.640
You can put a full fledged NVMe adapter in there or a SATA adapter with multiple ports or a gigabit NIC.

18:14.640 --> 18:19.640
I put a Western Digital NVMe in there and it's been running great.

18:19.640 --> 18:29.640
I really want to experiment with an HBA card in there or something and then attach eight hard drives, although I'm not sure how I'd power them. But I still want to try it, you know.

18:29.640 --> 18:37.640
It was incredible performance once you remove the I.O. bottleneck. Just like on the Raspberry Pi 4, it's been a pretty big improvement by going to a USB disk.

18:37.640 --> 18:45.640
I have been told by the audience, and these are my involved thoughts. That's why I consider the Pine 64 as still an in-testing server platform for me right now.

18:45.640 --> 18:56.640
And the Raspberry Pi 4 is my production platform. And I've gotten notes in the Discord that the Rock Pro 64 does not have Plex GPU decoding.

18:56.640 --> 19:00.640
I think that's an arm limitation more than a Rock Pro at the moment.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.640
The Pi does, though. The Pi 4 does.

19:02.640 --> 19:03.640
Does it?

19:03.640 --> 19:11.640
I mean, if it's doing it on the CPU, I don't have any complaints. Let's put it that way. But it seems like it must be on the GPU or its direct plane in most cases.

19:11.640 --> 19:21.640
That's probably it. When you're on your LAN, there's a surprising amount of stuff you can direct play because the clients have full 100 megabit bandwidth or whatever.

19:21.640 --> 19:32.640
If my testing with the Rock Pro 64 goes well, I'll probably make it my go-to server platform because the Pine 64 guys have said this is a five-year LTS hardware board.

19:32.640 --> 19:36.640
We're supporting this until at least 2023 or 2024.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.640
That's pretty cool.

19:38.640 --> 19:48.640
It's very appealing to me. And with increased performance on the disk and now the CPU, I think I'm also reaping the rewards of this thing having low-power DDR4 as well.

19:48.640 --> 19:56.640
So it's got faster RAM than the Pi 4 does. And I think all of these things are coming together to deliver pretty significant performance.

19:56.640 --> 20:04.640
And I remember when I was talking to our buddy Cheese about it, he was telling me, you know, you've really got to check out the Rock Pro 64 because for a server, I think it'd perform a lot better.

20:04.640 --> 20:16.640
And I was skeptical primarily because the Raspberry Pi Foundation has done such a good job at cultivating a community and a network effect of images.

20:16.640 --> 20:22.640
But I think the Pine guys are coming in a pretty close second to some of that. There's a really solid technical community around it.

20:22.640 --> 20:27.640
The Manjaro version for the Pine 64 feels first class.

20:27.640 --> 20:34.640
And I have yet to try an LTS Ubuntu on there, but there is an 1804 image and there's lots of other great images.

20:34.640 --> 20:39.640
There's a real community growing around it. I think it's a good second contender in network effect to the Raspberry Pi.

20:39.640 --> 20:51.640
And so with the I.O. that I'm achieving and the CPU performance combined with the network effect growing and that LTS of five years of hardware support from the board, from the manufacturers,

20:51.640 --> 20:57.640
I'm thinking this is looking like my go to solution now, probably for any future system I build.

20:57.640 --> 21:04.640
I'm even contemplating small little displays around the RV that would be run powered by this thing.

21:04.640 --> 21:15.640
I have a cool little display. I use this for my Raspberry Pis. It's a little five inch Nextion 800 by 480 pixel touch screen.

21:15.640 --> 21:19.640
So I use it for 3D printer interface, which is kind of cool.

21:19.640 --> 21:26.640
Oh, sure. Yeah. But to come back to your point about network effects, I think that is really important for the Pi.

21:26.640 --> 21:33.640
And when I was looking after LUP for, you know, cases and stuff like that for the Rock Pro, the selection wasn't great.

21:33.640 --> 21:42.640
Not nearly as many options. And the ones you do have are either first party or sort of second rate.

21:42.640 --> 21:51.640
I think that is a limitation. The other challenge there is that they have a limited shipping capacity. So when you order things, it takes a while and there's not everything on Amazon.

21:51.640 --> 22:00.640
However, all of the other bits like a PCI adapter to run an MVME drive or eMMC module or the SD cards,

22:00.640 --> 22:06.640
all of those are standard components that as long as they're Linux compatible, they'll be compatible with the Pine board. You could buy those anywhere.

22:06.640 --> 22:13.640
So how much? The board itself is, what, $80 or $90? Yeah. By the time you have the SSD in there and everything.

22:13.640 --> 22:24.640
All in. Plus, you also have to buy a power brick. I rounded everything up. The price of everything was rounded up and then I totaled that and rounded that up and it came out to $150.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.640
OK. It's not cheap.

22:26.640 --> 22:36.640
No, and I could probably spend another $30, $40 on cooling solutions, which is why I ordered this case here because it has a built in heat sink. So we'll see how that goes for me.

22:36.640 --> 22:48.640
When I was building a PFSense box in July last year, I wanted a low power x86 system, you know, something that was drawing 10 to 15 watts because it's going to be on 24 seven.

22:48.640 --> 23:00.640
And I settled on a used system from eBay. It's an x86 based CPU. So it's an i5 3470T, which is the low power version. That was $29.

23:00.640 --> 23:11.640
So if you think about it, it's an i5 third gen for $29. That's pretty performant. There's an Intel DQ77KB motherboard, which has dual gigabit LAN built in.

23:11.640 --> 23:25.640
It takes laptop memory. So that's nice and cheap. And that was $37. Four gigs of RAM was six bucks. The power supply was $20. And I got a little MSATA SSD for 20 bucks.

23:25.640 --> 23:35.640
So for about $100, you can build a low power x86 based system, which is just as performant and arguably better supported.

23:35.640 --> 23:46.640
Yeah, I think that's the big question. Of course, for mine, the biggest cost was the NVMe drive. I could have gone with like an eMMC module or something cheaper.

23:46.640 --> 23:50.640
But I was going for the most performance possible because we were going to be punishing it.

23:50.640 --> 23:53.640
Yeah, you're Chris. You have to go baller. I know this about you.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.640
I sometimes got it.

23:55.640 --> 23:56.640
Go big or go home.

23:56.640 --> 24:05.640
The other two big pressures I have in my situation are heat output of the device and, as you just mentioned, the draw of power.

24:05.640 --> 24:11.640
Those things combined with performance are this ratio that I feel like I am constantly playing with.

24:11.640 --> 24:26.640
And I will note, because I'm running an additional Pi 4 right now, this is the one that I'm running Ubuntu on that I set up the new HaasIO home assistant setup on, now that I'm running a fourth Pi, I can notice the power draw difference.

24:26.640 --> 24:35.640
And it is generating probably more heat in that space, just adding one more small device that I am comfortable with. It's a really delicate balance in there.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.640
We almost went the whole episode without mentioning home assistant. Almost.

24:38.640 --> 24:50.640
I can't, man. They just had a great update. And my setup is so great now. I am so glad you talked me into trying out hacks and the whole actual what is now called home assistant stack.

24:50.640 --> 24:56.640
I have so much more confidence when I can take a nice, big, beautiful snapshot right before I do the new upgrades.

24:56.640 --> 24:59.640
Yeah, that does remove some of the anxiety, it must be said.

24:59.640 --> 25:09.640
Yes. And the theme is it's more appealing, like it impresses the family, like they think it's neat, it's nice, it looks cool. They think it's a high tech thing and they have now.

25:09.640 --> 25:12.640
Well, it is. And it should be impressive.

25:12.640 --> 25:29.640
But also on top of that, it was just a good chance for me to redo my nighttime scripts and my bedtime scripts. And this time the kids have lived with it long enough that they had a couple of ideas on how I could adjust the bedtime scripts.

25:29.640 --> 25:44.640
And it's great because they've taken to it, they like it, and it helps them with their nighttime routine. And so they just had a few ideas. So I was able to incorporate that stuff and Hadia's ideas and we created a few systems to turn things on and off when we're leaving that we didn't have before.

25:44.640 --> 25:53.640
So it's just sort of nice to go through and clean it up and really do it right now with all the lessons learned, applied and the tricks that you showed me all kind of coming together.

25:53.640 --> 26:06.640
That bedtime routine has been a real quality of life improvement. I know I've said it on this show before, but enforced 20 minute bedtime routine, or 25 minutes I think it is now, I've tweaked it a little bit.

26:06.640 --> 26:19.640
When those lights dim for the final 90 seconds, I know I have to put my phone down because it's about to get dark. And it's just, okay, well, I don't need to spend another 45 minutes on Reddit. I mean, what am I going to be doing looking at who knows what?

26:19.640 --> 26:30.640
That works for my kids too, that sort of shutting it down. But the other thing is for my youngest, it's a little alarming to her if it just goes dark, she's uncomfortable with that.

26:30.640 --> 26:44.640
So having the lights dim for a bit and then get really dim as she drifts off to sleep and then an hour after she's asleep, like the last light goes out and she's totally fine. She's none the wiser of it. And it works great for her and keeps them asleep.

26:44.640 --> 26:56.640
So how do you go about choosing what you're going to buy? When you're going through this purchase methodology in your mind of, I need to buy this specific device, I think you touched on part of it, the LTS angle before.

26:56.640 --> 27:05.640
But if you're looking maybe more at networking gear, like switches, or like we talked about last time, Wi-Fi, that kind of stuff, what are some of the things that are going through your mind?

27:05.640 --> 27:19.640
The hardest thing with technology is it's always changing and if you were just to wait a little bit, you could get something better. Or if you spend a little more right now, you could get something that lasts longer and you're always trying to make that calculation.

27:19.640 --> 27:35.640
And so what I have done for a lot of really big decisions like this is I'll set like a North Star intent. So what is my intent with, say, the RV setup? Well, my intent is ultimately one day when I really zoom out, I want to power everything off of DC.

27:35.640 --> 27:42.640
And then when I zoom in closer, I want to be low power, low heat. And when I zoom in closer, I want it to be silent and I want it to be low maintenance, low effort.

27:42.640 --> 27:58.640
That's why the five year LTS of both a board and an operating system are very appealing to me. And so when I zoom all the way out and think about the big post items like the Northern Star one, and then I zoom all the way down into the details of what I want to have to manage, that helps me make an informed decision.

27:58.640 --> 28:12.640
So like another scenario with networking gear is maybe I want to have multiple VLANs and I want to have insights into the traffic that's going over those individual ports. And I'd like to be able to do it from both a web browser and a command line.

28:12.640 --> 28:20.640
And then when I zoom out from that, I want something that runs efficiently where I can put a lot of load under it for video transfer.

28:20.640 --> 28:31.640
And in this particular setup, because of where my networking gear is, noise isn't really a factor for me when I come to purchasing. So okay, then I zoom out a little bit further. I'd like this to run for about five years and I'll go through a stack like that.

28:31.640 --> 28:36.640
And I will end up with a very different piece of networking equipment than I might end up for a Plex server.

28:36.640 --> 28:51.640
It's really interesting when you look at how different companies mature and how their business models change. One of the factors I like to take into account is how long a company has been around and what their track record is. I look at Netgear as a good example.

28:51.640 --> 29:04.640
They're kind of boring and they kind of just do the job and they've been around for as long as I've been into computers. And when I buy a Netgear switch, I know that in five years I'll be able to replace it with probably the exact same thing.

29:04.640 --> 29:15.640
And when you zoom in on that, your intention there is something that is so reliable it could actually be completely out of your mind. You don't even really have to worry about it ever.

29:15.640 --> 29:17.640
Boring is good. Boring is reliable.

29:17.640 --> 29:24.640
That would be sort of your Northern Star intent on that piece of equipment and inform your purchasing. And then when you zoom in, is noise a factor?

29:24.640 --> 29:39.640
Well, is noise a factor? Because my server is in my basement, which the only thing that's going to get annoyed down there are the cockroaches. So when I think about my requirements, okay, a desktop switch or something like that, of course, that has to be silent.

29:39.640 --> 29:55.640
But I generally go for the five to eight port gigabit switches that are now so unbelievably cheap. I was looking at going 10 gig when I moved into this house and I've run the Cat 6A cable to enable me to do that in future if the prices come down.

29:55.640 --> 30:12.640
But right now, you know, I would be looking at several hundred dollars to equip two or three devices with 10 gig networking versus 20 or 30 dollars for a couple of switches for gigabit. And I would love to have 10 gig just in one place between my desktop and my server.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.640
But it's just not worth the cost right now.

30:14.640 --> 30:34.640
Now, I know. I know. I think to the other factor with networking equipment to consider is that you may want to use your home lab as a test bed to learn. And so sometimes it's worth thinking about trying to find something that still has some decent value on eBay.

30:34.640 --> 30:46.640
It's not the worst idea in the world to buy a used switch. I know it seems weird at first because it's such a key piece of equipment, but some of these higher end switches are rated to run for a lifetime and you get them off of eBay.

30:46.640 --> 30:59.640
A lot of the fundamentals on how to manage them and set up networking basic stuff like VLANs and and mirroring your port so you can monitor traffic. It's all going to still be relevant even on a five year old Cisco switch.

30:59.640 --> 31:10.640
And then there is the self improvement angle, which I think is quite often overlooked when people are trying to decide between self hosting or using a cloud service or buying an off the shelf product.

31:10.640 --> 31:20.640
You know, I make this point in my 2019 perfect media server article where I'm comparing basically a synology to a self hosted do it yourself type system.

31:20.640 --> 31:32.640
And when you look at the skills that you have to learn in order to build a self hosted system that is reliable and will be able to run for five years, all that kind of stuff, those are skills you can take directly and get a job with.

31:32.640 --> 31:52.640
A well paying job and you can lift yourself very quickly out of being a level one, level two support in a call center or something by doing a lot of these projects at home. And so buying a Cisco switch off eBay, learning iOS and becoming a CCNA certified Cisco network admin.

31:52.640 --> 32:06.640
So what CCNA stands for, you know, being a CCNA or a Red Hat certified, whatever, you know, there's a lot of investment in yourself beyond just the physical hardware that you can you can get out of this stuff.

32:06.640 --> 32:19.640
Yeah, that's why it's important to consider that when you are purchasing network gear, because if that isn't you, then something more along the lines of an unmanaged switch might be what you want.

32:19.640 --> 32:31.640
Those are really the two categories. You have unmanaged and managed switches. And so if you're looking to do networking at a more granular level, you want to learn, maybe use it for building a cool home lab.

32:31.640 --> 32:43.640
You want to manage switch and there's cheap ones you can buy today brand new and there's expensive ones. I mean, I'm talking, you know, five thousand dollars plus that now you can get on eBay for a couple hundred dollars.

32:43.640 --> 32:57.640
Those are the managed switches. However, if you're like me and, you know, you're going to be connecting four Raspberry Pis and a Wi-Fi router, I went unmanaged. I went an unmanaged net gear for that one because it's just a simple setup with a very simple network loadout.

32:57.640 --> 33:03.640
It doesn't need to do much. I just want it to be gigabit. And so I went unmanaged and it's also silent.

33:03.640 --> 33:08.640
I've only ever had one managed switch in my life and that is the only switch that's ever failed on me.

33:08.640 --> 33:09.640
Well, they are more complex.

33:09.640 --> 33:22.640
I'm not saying there's a correlation, but, you know, it's just purely anecdotal. But I would say for most people, most of the time, especially at home, even if you're doing home lab stuff, unless you're a network engineer, you probably don't need a managed switch.

33:22.640 --> 33:29.640
No, probably not. I, of course, did have a managed switch when Angela and I built our house.

33:29.640 --> 33:43.640
I put a really loud, regrettably loud HP managed switch in there. The thing never died, though. I mean, they were so rock solid, but they were just jet engines and it was really neat.

33:43.640 --> 33:44.640
You had a diamond jute back then though.

33:44.640 --> 33:54.640
Yeah, there's that. And also in my day job, I was managing tons of HP switches and Dell switches, which I didn't like as much, but I really did like those HP switches.

33:54.640 --> 34:06.640
It, to me, was worth it because I love turning on mirrored ports or doing small little segments of networks and things that you could do on these switches that were, well, they were just really fun to mess around with.

34:06.640 --> 34:16.640
But these days, it all works pretty well. Back in the good old days, you'd have to worry about things not matching up like your duplex settings, you know, and your Nick not auto negotiating properly.

34:16.640 --> 34:19.640
And that stuff just sounds even silly now to even talk about.

34:19.640 --> 34:21.640
This old man Chris shouting at a cloud.

34:21.640 --> 34:39.640
Which brings us nicely to the last item in the show doc today, which is if you do this stuff right, if you design a house, build a house or add stuff to your house, like a ethernet cabling or something like that, you can actually add value to your house.

34:39.640 --> 34:46.640
And one of the hardest things that you have to solve is how do you transfer accounts to the new owner?

34:46.640 --> 35:05.640
Well, Alex, if you're self-hosting, this is much simpler. It is significantly harder if you've got like the TP-Link casa home plugs and you've got Hughes lights that are associated with your Hughes account and you have all these different vendors, which I used to have.

35:05.640 --> 35:12.640
I think that's nearly impossible. But in home assistance slash self-hosted setup, it's actually much more straightforward.

35:12.640 --> 35:21.640
I would think in the traditional consumer scenario where you just have tons of different accounts, it's going to vary depending on each one of those services.

35:21.640 --> 35:30.640
My wife is addicted to this Architectural Digest YouTube channel where they go around $20 million houses in Beverly Hills and it's stupid.

35:30.640 --> 35:44.640
But every single one of those houses has one of these Lutron smart home systems in it that is just like a spaceship and they're tapping three different things to do all the stuff and I'm like, that's so far away from where I want to be.

35:44.640 --> 35:50.640
It looks cool and I guess that's what they're going for in that price point. I just want simple and functional.

35:50.640 --> 36:01.640
I'm not going to take Ethernet cable out of the walls if it's there, but stuff like the Wi-Fi access points, I'll take those with me and I'll leave the Ethernet cable dangling for the next person.

36:01.640 --> 36:17.640
A lot of the lights in my house are smart bulbs or smart switches. I will probably take my little Shelley things out of the switches when I leave unless they add value to the house because they're $20 each and I've got like five or six of them.

36:17.640 --> 36:33.640
That's my thought is I would negotiate with the purchaser if they want those things. One of the things I'm really pretty proud of my setup is with just a few exceptions like the tablet being mounted at a certain spot, you really can't tell that there's any automation at all.

36:33.640 --> 36:34.640
It's all fairly invisible.

36:34.640 --> 36:37.640
Here's the thing, Chris. Most people don't care.

36:37.640 --> 36:38.640
No.

36:38.640 --> 36:44.640
Light switch is fine for most people. A proprietary service is fine for most people. They just don't really care, which is sad.

36:44.640 --> 36:53.640
No, I think you're right. I think it's one of those you have to experience it. I mean, even the kids appreciate it now, which I never expected.

36:53.640 --> 37:02.640
And my wife, Adia, has said to me several times that this winter was so much more comfortable than any winter we've had because of the automated heat system.

37:02.640 --> 37:09.640
It was just nice. It was really nice not to manage it because it's often very challenging when it gets below freezing.

37:09.640 --> 37:15.640
And I think you can appreciate it once you've had one. It's the same thing with the smart speakers.

37:15.640 --> 37:24.640
And when I'm walking in with groceries in the dark and I could just shout out to the room, turn on all of the lights and just boom, I can see all of a sudden I'm like, man, that's great.

37:24.640 --> 37:30.640
That's so great. And it's instantaneous. You got to experience that a few times before you go, oh, that was nice.

37:30.640 --> 37:41.640
We went to a neighbor that lives just behind last night. They had a fire pit on their driveway, socially distanced, of course, and, you know, drinking a few brewskis, came back a little worse for wear.

37:41.640 --> 37:47.640
And we're sort of stumbling in the dark up to our house. And I just pull my phone out over LTE.

37:47.640 --> 37:55.640
I turn on all the lights in the house, open the garage doors, and we sort of stumble through the garage and it's all fine because we couldn't find our keys.

37:55.640 --> 38:01.640
Yes, that's really nice. It's really and it's also a great way to save energy because I can have the heat down when we're not there.

38:01.640 --> 38:04.640
And then when we're when we're coming home, it can start warming it back up.

38:04.640 --> 38:08.640
And I like that aspect of it, too, because I feel like we're saving power and we're saving.

38:08.640 --> 38:12.640
We also have a similar system for water and all of those things are really nice.

38:12.640 --> 38:19.640
But I would kind of maybe just push back a little bit on your implication there that nobody cares.

38:19.640 --> 38:31.640
I think you're right for the majority. However, I was just reading something about how the speed of an Internet connection in an area is having a big impact on whether people buy a home or not these days.

38:31.640 --> 38:41.640
These things are starting to matter. I use my dad as a good bit of litmus paper to tell whether it's something most people care about and he just couldn't give two monkeys.

38:41.640 --> 38:49.640
So I think it's limited to nerds at the moment, but the smart home as an industry is not limited to nerds.

38:49.640 --> 38:54.640
I'm talking about self-hosted smart homes where you do a lot of this stuff yourself.

38:54.640 --> 39:00.640
Yeah, maybe some of it, like, you know, if I were going to if I were going to sell lady dupes with all this automation,

39:00.640 --> 39:07.640
maybe it would make sense to leave a lot of the wired stuff in and the cameras and the sensors, but take out the computers and the next user puts theirs in.

39:07.640 --> 39:12.640
But cameras is a good one. I bet if I leave those behind, they'd add value.

39:12.640 --> 39:18.640
Right. I think AP points would I think AP points. It's like calling them Nick cards. I think access points would, too.

39:18.640 --> 39:23.640
You know, everybody always says a Nick card. It's like, well, wait a minute. You're just saying card twice.

39:23.640 --> 39:28.640
PC computers. Yes. That kind of thing.

39:28.640 --> 39:40.640
And also, it's one of those where maybe in two to five years when people have gone through a few cycles, more of some services being shut down and people's devices quit working.

39:40.640 --> 39:45.640
And that becomes more of a front of mind concern because, you know, it's going to happen.

39:45.640 --> 39:49.640
I hope so, because then this podcast is going to go through the roof.

39:49.640 --> 39:55.640
It'll be great for the show. Oh, man, it'll be great for Home Assistant. There, boom, another mention.

39:55.640 --> 40:00.640
We need a bell for Home Assistant. My goal is to get three in now. That's the thing.

40:00.640 --> 40:04.640
OK, OK. So where should we send folks throughout the rest of the week?

40:04.640 --> 40:10.640
Well, there's always that wiki that's in development, which we haven't mentioned too recently, but there is wiki.selfhosted.show.

40:10.640 --> 40:15.640
We'd love to also get your thoughts and feedback and feel free to push back on things like Plex for media hosting.

40:15.640 --> 40:23.640
We like that, too. But do it constructively. Give us your experience with your alternative at selfhosted.show slash contact.

40:23.640 --> 40:28.640
And then last but not least, while you're over there at that self-hosted page, go ahead and click that Discord link.

40:28.640 --> 40:37.640
It's a really good community in there. And I'm going to give a shout out to Linux Unplugged episode 349, where Chris torture tests that rock pro.

40:37.640 --> 40:42.640
That was a lot of fun. Yeah, good mention. I think people like this show. They'll probably like that episode.

40:42.640 --> 40:57.640
Well, Alex, I think that's self-hosted 17.
