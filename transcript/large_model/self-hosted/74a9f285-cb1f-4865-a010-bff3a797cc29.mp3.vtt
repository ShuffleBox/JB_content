WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.540
Coming up on today's show, we get fancy with traffic labels and then gush over

00:03.540 --> 00:07.200
some of the new home assistant features while we save our data from certain

00:07.200 --> 00:07.620
failure.

00:08.460 --> 00:11.080
I'm Chris and I'm Alex, and this is self hosted.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.620
I'm so excited.

00:13.640 --> 00:14.500
Autumn is here.

00:14.500 --> 00:15.720
The fall is here.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.800
I'm wearing jeans today for the first time in five months.

00:19.000 --> 00:19.200
Yeah.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.040
I'm wearing pants too.

00:20.040 --> 00:22.620
And I don't typically podcast with pants.

00:23.080 --> 00:23.520
I love that.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.520
That's a thing.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.040
I don't typically podcast with pants.

00:27.520 --> 00:28.200
It's too warm.

00:28.200 --> 00:31.680
You know, a gentleman wants to be comfortable, so that way his

00:31.680 --> 00:32.920
analysis is comfortable.

00:34.640 --> 00:35.520
You got nothing.

00:38.160 --> 00:41.200
You're just thinking back over all the episodes, pantless.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.320
Hey, I didn't say I'm not wearing shorts, Alex.

00:43.320 --> 00:46.080
You know, I'm not saying I was thinking that you do what you're thinking with

00:46.080 --> 00:48.160
your dick, so you've got to keep that at the correct temperature.

00:48.160 --> 00:52.200
And well, let's just say I can't think if it's too warm, but then thought

00:52.200 --> 00:55.480
that probably wasn't, wasn't radio appropriate.

00:55.520 --> 00:56.640
No, of course not.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.360
No, of course not, no, no, of course not.

00:59.400 --> 01:03.520
You know, what we ought to do is, uh, maybe not talk about our pants and

01:03.520 --> 01:06.040
instead talk about, you know, self-hosting things.

01:06.520 --> 01:12.480
Maybe this episode is brought to you by a cloud guru.

01:12.680 --> 01:15.800
Are you looking to get a high paying career, maybe move into the cloud

01:15.800 --> 01:17.120
and make some good change?

01:17.560 --> 01:20.640
Well, there's no better place to start than getting a certification.

01:20.880 --> 01:25.000
ACG has helped more than 2 million people scale up on the cloud, AWS, Azure,

01:25.000 --> 01:29.920
and Google cloud platform head over to cloud guru.com and get started.

01:30.160 --> 01:32.760
So let's crack things off with a public service announcement.

01:32.800 --> 01:33.120
All right.

01:33.160 --> 01:37.640
The Linux server to IO team have made some changes to their reverse proxy.

01:37.640 --> 01:41.400
So for many, many years, they've released a let's encrypt container.

01:41.720 --> 01:45.840
Now they've been contacted by let's encrypt to enforce their trademarks.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.000
So they've had to rename it.

01:47.600 --> 01:51.560
They've renamed it swag for secure web application gateway.

01:51.880 --> 01:52.960
Oh, okay.

01:52.960 --> 01:56.040
I thought it was going to be security. We all get, it could be.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.760
I mean, it's an acronym.

01:57.760 --> 01:58.920
It can be whatever you want, right?

01:59.200 --> 01:59.880
I like to think so.

02:00.320 --> 02:03.600
It's a drop in replacement for the existing let's encrypt container.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.040
And there is a blog post linked in the show notes.

02:06.080 --> 02:09.680
So if you're running the old one, it's going to stop being updated

02:09.680 --> 02:10.800
in favor of this new one.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.560
Just go ahead and update your compose file or whatever you're doing.

02:13.840 --> 02:18.440
Well, you know, big congratulations to Linux server.io for getting large enough

02:18.440 --> 02:21.160
that they showed up on the trademark radar of let's encrypt.

02:21.160 --> 02:24.920
That's a milestone. I think they're at about 12 billion pulls these days.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.080
So that they're doing pretty well.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.560
Ooh, we, I know I'm one of them.

02:28.560 --> 02:33.960
I just pulled down, uh, my new images for plex, sync thing, and a few other very

02:33.960 --> 02:37.560
handy backend services that are Linux server, IO, Docker images.

02:38.040 --> 02:42.440
So I have a link to that, like, like Alex said, self-hosted dot show slash two eight.

02:42.680 --> 02:45.400
We'll talk a little bit more about some new Linux server image

02:45.400 --> 02:46.680
that's been released this week.

02:46.680 --> 02:54.480
But first I've been experimenting with traffic, uh, it's spelled T R a E F I K.

02:54.480 --> 02:58.440
So traffic is kind of how it's spelled, but I think everybody just says it traffic.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.080
Yeah.

02:59.120 --> 03:00.880
We've talked about it a little bit before on the show.

03:01.040 --> 03:05.280
Now in the last episode, I mentioned Lychee, which by the way, if you're

03:05.280 --> 03:09.720
American is pronounced leechy and if you're from the UK is pronounced Lychee.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.000
I went on Wikipedia and checked.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.840
Oh, that's, that's not confusing at all.

03:13.880 --> 03:14.320
Okay.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.720
Potato, potato anyway, right?

03:16.880 --> 03:20.640
So I started building out some infrastructure using our new sponsor Linode.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.200
I was using Ansible and Terraform to do this.

03:23.520 --> 03:27.680
And one of the things that I like to do is use ginger templating

03:28.080 --> 03:30.000
to create my Docker compose files.

03:30.640 --> 03:34.960
This means I can store all of my container variables in Ansible, run it

03:34.960 --> 03:38.240
through the ginger templating engine, and it spits out a Docker compose

03:38.240 --> 03:39.200
file on the other side.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.120
Now, when I was using engine X as my reverse proxy, I was using

03:43.120 --> 03:44.600
engine X as my reverse proxy.

03:44.960 --> 03:48.880
It meant I had to also have an Ansible role that copied across and installed

03:48.880 --> 03:51.880
the relevant engine X configuration files.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.680
And for anybody that's ever worked with those files, they can be a little

03:55.680 --> 03:57.680
bit picky and a little bit cryptic.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.680
The best thing, the single best thing about traffic is that all of the

04:02.680 --> 04:08.520
configuration now for my reverse proxy lives alongside each container as a label.

04:09.000 --> 04:09.200
Yeah.

04:09.200 --> 04:13.440
Talk about this label thing because I'm not a traffic expert, but that's

04:13.440 --> 04:16.880
my essential understanding is that it sort of assigns what you

04:16.880 --> 04:18.080
can do based on your label.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.080
Correct.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.360
I'm still wrapping my head around it.

04:20.600 --> 04:20.880
Right.

04:21.080 --> 04:24.000
And it's something I've been using for about a month now.

04:25.120 --> 04:28.280
I had a lot of help with some of the guys on discord in particular.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.720
I know I seem to mention discord every week, but it's a lot going on over there.

04:31.760 --> 04:32.600
That's where the fun is.

04:32.600 --> 04:39.800
So I've, I've put together a kind of beginner's guide to traffic,

04:39.840 --> 04:41.600
but not as a blog post for once.

04:42.080 --> 04:47.360
What I've actually done is I've just put a, a compose file in my infrastructure repo.

04:47.680 --> 04:48.160
Oh, okay.

04:48.160 --> 04:48.720
I'll put on GitHub.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.360
And a link to that of course is in the show notes.

04:52.080 --> 04:57.360
And in there, what you can hopefully see is just how simple this thing is to configure.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.880
So you define a series of routers and services.

05:00.880 --> 05:05.600
And as part of those routers and services, you define the host name and

05:05.600 --> 05:07.120
the entry point you want to use.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.960
So for, for me, I use Cloudflare for my DNS.

05:10.360 --> 05:15.400
So traffic will automatically talk to Cloudflare as part of the ACME process to

05:15.400 --> 05:17.800
get my TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt.

05:18.520 --> 05:23.880
So I tell each container to use that particular certificate resolver, Cloudflare.

05:24.520 --> 05:28.000
And then from there, I tell the router which service to use.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.840
So for example, for NGINX, if I'm running that as a container behind traffic would

05:32.840 --> 05:38.360
be on port 80 or Plex would be on three to 400, for example, and it's just super simple.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.040
And where are you defining this?

05:40.080 --> 05:42.040
Where does that information get stored?

05:42.080 --> 05:43.160
What, what mechanism?

05:43.560 --> 05:44.320
That's the best part.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.760
So with NGINX, for example, it would be in a Docker volume that I would mount

05:51.800 --> 05:56.000
through a bind mount system to my container, and then those reverse proxy

05:56.000 --> 06:01.400
configuration files need to persist on my host, right with traffic.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.760
It's a label that lives in the Docker compose file.

06:04.760 --> 06:08.480
So right next to where I'm saying, I want to run, you know, Linux

06:08.480 --> 06:13.160
server slash Plex, for example, I then have a label section with five lines

06:13.160 --> 06:19.360
in it that says traffic enable true use this host name, so Plex dot KTZ dot

06:19.360 --> 06:23.160
whatever use this entry point of web secure.

06:23.160 --> 06:28.080
So HTTPS, for example, and then use the cert resolver of Cloudflare.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.160
This is the fourth line.

06:29.160 --> 06:32.560
And then the fifth line is use port three to 400.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.000
And it's just right there.

06:34.040 --> 06:34.760
It's simple.

06:35.040 --> 06:38.280
It's easy to read YAML that's just in the Docker compose file.

06:38.280 --> 06:41.200
And I think that's the part that really has to be underscored.

06:41.240 --> 06:44.480
And it's so tidy because it's right there with all of the other

06:44.480 --> 06:46.120
information about that container.

06:46.400 --> 06:51.600
It's easy to read, easy to replicate and associated and attached with that container.

06:51.600 --> 06:57.640
And because it's in that single file, if I commit that single file to get, I have

06:57.640 --> 07:02.440
a history forever until the end of time, exactly what my configuration parameters

07:02.440 --> 07:04.200
worth for that specific container.

07:04.760 --> 07:07.920
Whereas if I'm relying on a bunch of different files that are on my file

07:07.920 --> 07:13.520
system in different directories and stuff like that, who's to say that my Ansible

07:13.520 --> 07:16.960
role don't have a bug in it that doesn't overwrite that particular file when I

07:16.960 --> 07:21.560
changed the name of the container or whatever it is, there's just a whole bunch

07:21.560 --> 07:26.360
of edge case scenarios that this solves for me and I absolutely love it.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.000
How are you choosing what gets committed to Git?

07:29.000 --> 07:31.320
Are you, is it every config file?

07:31.320 --> 07:33.760
Are you hand committing certain config files?

07:33.760 --> 07:34.480
What's the system there?

07:35.000 --> 07:39.320
Well, I have a blog post about working with Ansible and secrets.

07:39.560 --> 07:44.680
The short version of that is I use the Ansible vault functionality to encrypt

07:44.680 --> 07:51.040
a couple of files in my repo, all of the secret source lives in that encrypted

07:51.040 --> 07:58.120
file, Ansible then interpolates through its templating engines, those variables

07:58.200 --> 08:03.160
into the playbooks when it runs, Ansible looks for a specific variable.

08:03.600 --> 08:07.120
If it can't find it in a decrypted file, it will go to the encrypted

08:07.120 --> 08:08.200
file and look for it.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.120
And so for me, I generally tend to go with the appropriate

08:13.120 --> 08:18.120
tend to go with the approach that anything that's personally identifiable,

08:18.160 --> 08:24.440
like an IP address or a serial number or an API key, obviously is secret.

08:24.920 --> 08:28.760
Just anything that I would rather somebody else didn't know, I tend to put

08:28.760 --> 08:33.120
in the vault file and then use my Ansible roles to decrypt.

08:33.880 --> 08:37.920
Now, the downside of that is it means it has to live in plain

08:37.920 --> 08:42.680
text on disk somewhere, but the reality of being a sysadmin is that at

08:42.680 --> 08:46.280
some point somewhere, something's got to be in clear text.

08:46.280 --> 08:49.480
Somebody has to have the ultimate password somewhere.

08:49.520 --> 08:54.600
Even if it's in your brain, encryption is, is great, but at some, some point

08:54.600 --> 08:57.360
somewhere, somebody needs the key to that vault.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.240
Well, that's pretty cool, Alex.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.040
I like that I can just go in here and read this.

09:01.160 --> 09:05.080
And that also makes it very easy for me to get started because this, being able

09:05.080 --> 09:07.440
to actually see this example here, which we'll have linked in the show notes.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.440
Really makes it click for me.

09:09.520 --> 09:12.440
Like the, cause the other thing we haven't even talked about is the

09:12.440 --> 09:17.160
user front end web UI to traffic and all of that stuff, but fully understanding

09:17.360 --> 09:21.920
how I label stuff in Docker compose kind of completes my understanding.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.560
And now I really kind of see why people are talking about traffic.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.680
It looks really nice.

09:26.080 --> 09:30.760
It was a big change in how traffic defined their routers and services

09:30.760 --> 09:34.120
and front ends and back ends between V1 and V2.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.480
Now we're talking about V2, the current release.

09:37.080 --> 09:42.240
Now in V1 times that I just wrote them off as cluttering my doc compose file.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.000
I didn't want that.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.600
I didn't want that clutter in my, in my file, but as I've kind of matured

09:47.600 --> 09:51.120
my approach to, you know, configuring all these different systems, I now

09:51.120 --> 09:54.440
have my personal server at home.

09:54.440 --> 09:57.760
I have a cloud instance that I configure that runs all my websites, you know,

09:57.760 --> 10:01.840
my blog and stuff like that, and some stuff for my family as well.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.920
I then have the self-hosted infrastructure and a couple of

10:04.920 --> 10:06.800
other things I also look after.

10:07.400 --> 10:11.960
By the time I'm scaling this to five, six, seven different sites, it's

10:11.960 --> 10:16.120
just really nice to have one single source of truth be that compose file.

10:16.360 --> 10:16.640
Yep.

10:16.920 --> 10:17.520
Amen to that.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.360
That's how I feel too.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.920
Well, you heard Alex mentioned it.

10:21.200 --> 10:21.800
We use it.

10:21.840 --> 10:22.360
We love it.

10:22.600 --> 10:28.800
Linode, linode.com slash SSH, get a $100 60 day credit on new accounts.

10:29.240 --> 10:30.400
And here's a little pro tip.

10:30.400 --> 10:36.480
Linode just posted a guide on using object storage as a backend storage

10:36.480 --> 10:40.360
mechanism for next cloud, where you can kind of just have unlimited space, but

10:40.360 --> 10:46.240
you also take advantage of their crazy fast storage and it's what we use.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.120
It's how we do it here at Jupiter broadcasting.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.840
And so I'm going to put a link to this in the show notes because Linode is

10:51.880 --> 10:54.880
simple cloud infrastructure that you can spin up for anything you need.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.960
A shared host is something with dedicated GPUs or CPUs.

10:57.960 --> 11:02.120
Everything's priced really reasonable and they have a cloud management

11:02.120 --> 11:04.320
UI to take care of all of it.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.960
You just get started by going to linode.com slash SSH.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.480
You mentioned Alex, that you were deploying some systems

11:10.480 --> 11:11.640
with Terraform on Linode.

11:11.640 --> 11:12.800
What's that process like?

11:13.040 --> 11:14.440
It's been really, really easy.

11:14.440 --> 11:19.280
Actually, the documentation up on Terraform providers website is very

11:19.280 --> 11:20.880
well-written, very well-documented.

11:21.320 --> 11:24.880
And if you would like to see a full example, of course, there's a link

11:24.880 --> 11:28.400
in the show notes to the self-hosted infrastructure repo that I'm using.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.960
Uh, and in there it's, it's just been really simple, really

11:31.960 --> 11:32.960
straightforward to get started.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.120
That's nice.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.520
That is really nice because you can plug it in with an orchestrated

11:37.520 --> 11:40.160
and orchestration switch you're already using or take advantage

11:40.160 --> 11:41.720
of the tools that they have.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.640
And what's great about Linode is they're the largest independent open cloud

11:45.640 --> 11:48.760
provider in the world with 11 global data centers.

11:49.320 --> 11:52.760
Linode has been around for about as long as user mode Linux has been around.

11:53.040 --> 11:57.200
Their founder saw the opportunity and built something that was accessible

11:57.240 --> 11:59.800
for just about everyone, just about everywhere.

11:59.960 --> 12:03.560
So go to linode.com slash SSH to get started and then check out

12:03.560 --> 12:04.920
the app marketplace, for example.

12:04.920 --> 12:07.560
An easy way to self-host your own applications and get started

12:07.560 --> 12:08.600
with their stack scripts.

12:08.840 --> 12:13.560
Another nice way to build a quick and easy system, reproducible, easy system.

12:14.080 --> 12:17.320
I just recently decided I'm going to set up a dedicated SSH jump host.

12:18.320 --> 12:22.480
At first it sounds kind of crazy, but then I realized at $5 a month, I can

12:22.480 --> 12:26.520
really go all in on the security on this box, maybe even kind of as a

12:26.600 --> 12:29.640
learning opportunity, and it'll be my jump host system to get

12:29.640 --> 12:30.760
around wherever I need to go.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.440
That's a great use for the $5 a month system.

12:33.440 --> 12:38.000
But our matrix box that runs the Jupiter broadcasting matrix server.

12:38.400 --> 12:39.600
That's a little more powerful.

12:39.640 --> 12:42.840
We went ahead and did a dedicated CPU for that one because there's hundreds

12:42.840 --> 12:44.240
of users using that system.

12:44.520 --> 12:45.720
And that's the great thing about Linode.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.360
They've been around for a long time.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.760
They're the largest independent open cloud provider, and they've got a great

12:50.760 --> 12:53.840
pricing structure and a very competitive dashboard.

12:53.840 --> 12:54.840
You got to go check them out.

12:55.160 --> 12:58.880
Linode.com slash SSH and a big thank you to Linode for sponsoring

12:58.880 --> 12:59.960
the self-hosted program.

12:59.960 --> 13:05.640
Last week, we celebrated our birthday and this week it's home assistant's birthday.

13:05.880 --> 13:06.080
Yeah.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.200
Only we get the presents.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.080
How great is that?

13:08.960 --> 13:09.800
We get all the new stuff.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.880
This is one of those things like before the show, Alex and I were like, how do we

13:13.880 --> 13:18.320
cover this because we could probably, I bet you make two episodes out of just

13:18.320 --> 13:19.840
the updates in this one release.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.280
This was a really big one.

13:21.760 --> 13:26.280
So we thought maybe instead we'd just pull out like two or three of like the

13:26.280 --> 13:30.000
heavy hitters and just talk about those and then link you to the resources.

13:30.960 --> 13:33.400
For those of you that haven't listened to the show for a while, Alex and

13:33.400 --> 13:35.520
I, big home assistant users.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.480
In fact, I use it more than ever these days.

13:37.560 --> 13:38.160
I don't know about you.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.160
I think you too, Alex, right?

13:39.200 --> 13:39.720
Huge.

13:39.720 --> 13:40.200
Continual.

13:40.240 --> 13:40.760
Huge.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.560
I love the home assistant.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.040
Well, the home assistant has the new release and I think probably the thing

13:47.040 --> 13:50.160
you're excited about, the thing I'm looking forward to is NFC tag support.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.360
I think that's going to be a big deal.

13:51.640 --> 13:52.160
Mm-hmm.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.560
It's really, really easy.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.760
It's really, really easy as well.

13:56.760 --> 14:01.000
So they've updated the companion apps that run on iOS and Android.

14:01.360 --> 14:04.920
So you can actually write the NFC tags directly from the app on your phone.

14:05.480 --> 14:09.320
And then as soon as you scan it, you can assign automations to it.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.880
So as part of this release this week, the automation engine

14:12.920 --> 14:14.440
has had a complete overhaul.

14:14.440 --> 14:18.000
So now the YAML based automation stuff is a lot better than it used to be.

14:18.640 --> 14:23.200
And so one of the things I've decided to do is stick an NFC tag on the outside of

14:23.200 --> 14:26.960
my house so I can tap my phone to the outside of my house and have it open

14:26.960 --> 14:28.440
my garage door, for example.

14:28.960 --> 14:32.800
Can't tell you the number of times I've been outside my house without my keys

14:32.800 --> 14:37.160
thinking I need to get in, but my keys are on the inside and the only door

14:37.160 --> 14:39.960
that's open is the back door, but I want to go in the front door right now.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.560
And this should be a solved problem.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.040
And I want to be lazy, dang it.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.400
No, I, I completely agree.

14:46.400 --> 14:51.960
So the, the mixer I have here, the Behringer X32 has a built-in

14:51.960 --> 14:53.400
spot for your cell phone.

14:53.480 --> 14:54.160
It's weird.

14:54.200 --> 14:57.840
I've never seen a mixer that does this, but it actually has a little spot for

14:57.840 --> 14:59.200
you to place your cell phone on the mixer.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.160
And that's because it has, I think a mobile app where you can control

15:02.160 --> 15:04.320
some of the mixer settings.

15:05.080 --> 15:08.240
You know what I did put a little NFC tag right in that spot.

15:08.240 --> 15:12.560
So when I set my phone down in its holder on the mixer, it turns on my

15:12.560 --> 15:14.520
lights, it changes the colors.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.600
It just sort of gets things ready to go.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.000
So I don't have to come in here and, you know, I don't even have to speak to

15:19.000 --> 15:21.040
the, to a, to an echo or anything.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.920
It just put it right down there and it communicates with the home assistant

15:23.920 --> 15:24.760
we have here at the studio.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.600
I love this feature and I'm going to do the same thing.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.320
I'm going to put a little tag outside.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.920
I'd like to find a black colored NFC tag.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.640
All the ones I have right now are white stickers.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.840
I found some heavy duty outdoor grade ones.

15:36.960 --> 15:37.680
Oh, really?

15:37.720 --> 15:38.680
They're about a buck each.

15:38.680 --> 15:40.880
So they're quite expensive for NFC tags.

15:41.000 --> 15:41.480
It's okay.

15:41.480 --> 15:44.040
It's got to survive going down the road and in the rain.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.120
So I'll put a link in the show notes.

15:46.480 --> 15:46.720
Okay.

15:46.720 --> 15:47.280
That'd be great.

15:47.280 --> 15:47.440
Yeah.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.840
That's the kind of thing I think I want to do is put something outside and

15:50.840 --> 15:52.120
just turn lights on and whatnot.

15:52.360 --> 15:56.320
You know, I came up with quite a fun thing to automate in this house.

15:56.720 --> 16:00.440
My wife loves classical music and I love sort of rock music, you know, like tool

16:00.440 --> 16:01.560
and green day and stuff like that.

16:02.040 --> 16:06.200
And so when we're cooking, we both generally want the opposite person's

16:06.480 --> 16:08.080
playlist to never be in existence.

16:08.520 --> 16:13.600
And so I've 3d printed a violin and a guitar, and I've put the NFC tags on the

16:13.600 --> 16:15.760
back of these 3d printed things.

16:16.040 --> 16:19.760
I just tap the thing that I want and it plays it through Spotify,

16:19.760 --> 16:21.800
through my Google home in the kitchen.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.520
That is a clever idea.

16:24.520 --> 16:27.880
I like the use of the 3d icon really to drive it home.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.720
Makes it a physical thing you're touching.

16:29.960 --> 16:30.320
Yeah.

16:31.040 --> 16:34.640
And then the other thing I've done is when it's been day, we have a little

16:34.640 --> 16:39.800
picture of a, a bin, which I've 3d printed again and put next to the bins in the

16:39.800 --> 16:40.200
kitchen.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.800
So we tap that and it turns all the lights in the whole house on so we can walk

16:43.800 --> 16:45.600
around for 20 minutes, empty all the bins.

16:45.600 --> 16:50.120
Uh, but then it also turns on the driveway lights, opens the garage door.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.040
Uh, so you don't have to do anything.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.600
The house is just ready for you to go out.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.160
Cause you know what?

16:54.560 --> 16:56.560
When you're in the, emptying the bins, you know what you're going to do.

16:56.560 --> 16:59.760
You're going to walk around, empty the bins, then go outside, put it in the big

16:59.760 --> 17:02.840
plastic ones outside, put them at the end of your driveway and then come back in

17:02.840 --> 17:03.120
again.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.120
Yeah, that's fantastic.

17:05.160 --> 17:09.000
I have a series of like outdoor lights and a couple of other things that I need

17:09.000 --> 17:11.440
to quickly take down and pack up.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.520
And what I have to do now is that when I'm outside, I have to bring out

17:14.520 --> 17:18.240
my phone and I re I load the home assistant UI, and then I tap them off

17:18.240 --> 17:19.320
before I unplug them all.

17:19.600 --> 17:23.280
So that way they're in an off state when I remove them from the network and I

17:23.280 --> 17:26.560
could just put an NFC tag out there and just totally do it that way.

17:26.880 --> 17:27.880
You totally could.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.160
Yeah.

17:29.960 --> 17:33.360
The magic part is with this bin automation.

17:33.360 --> 17:38.560
I'm very proud of this one is when it starts, it takes like a snapshot of the

17:38.560 --> 17:40.360
current scene of the house.

17:40.360 --> 17:46.000
So all the lights that are currently on are stored to a temporary state.

17:46.040 --> 17:50.760
If you're like a temporary scene 20 minutes later, when the bin automation

17:50.760 --> 17:55.400
finishes, that scene gets recalled on the house, just returns to how it was before.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.440
Oh, so the previous state is restored.

17:58.440 --> 17:59.400
That's great.

17:59.960 --> 18:00.800
That is nice.

18:00.800 --> 18:04.280
That's a real, that's see, now you're getting fancy with the automations with

18:04.280 --> 18:06.840
the 3d printing and the restoring the previous state.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.400
Like that's next level stuff there.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.320
Guy gets bored, particularly in lockdown.

18:10.600 --> 18:10.960
Yeah.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.560
And we love ourselves some home assistance.

18:12.560 --> 18:18.800
So the other thing that, uh, is noteworthy for Mac users and perhaps an indication

18:18.800 --> 18:22.360
of the knock-on effects of the upcoming Apple ecosystem with ARM processors in

18:22.360 --> 18:27.960
the Macs too, but home assistant companion app for the Mac is now a reality.

18:27.960 --> 18:32.400
It's early, it's rough, but the thing that's neat here, and I'd like to put a

18:32.400 --> 18:36.480
call out to the audience to see if we can pull this off for Linux is one of the

18:36.480 --> 18:42.240
many things this companion app can do on the Mac OS is observe the state of the

18:42.240 --> 18:46.920
Mac cause the Mac has several conditions in use idle screensaver sleeping, and it

18:46.920 --> 18:50.200
could turn those into sensors into home assistant among other things.

18:50.200 --> 18:53.720
There's other things that it's monitoring as well as sensor inputs to home

18:53.720 --> 18:57.000
assistant to help automate things around when you're using your computer.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.800
I love this idea and I'd like to apply it to other desktops.

19:01.160 --> 19:05.720
It can detect which Mike, which webcam is in use when you're on a particular

19:05.720 --> 19:10.640
zoom call or something, you could have a light outside of your office that turns

19:10.640 --> 19:15.640
red that says, I am on the phone, be quiet, stop making noise or, you know, like me.

19:15.640 --> 19:18.800
I mean, I'm that guy, but I have like lights and stuff in the background for

19:18.800 --> 19:20.880
my zoom calls, you know, I try to make it look presentable.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.040
You could have that stuff turn on when the mic activates.

19:23.320 --> 19:24.320
Is there a word for that?

19:24.360 --> 19:26.640
I feel like it's going to be added to the dictionary soon.

19:26.680 --> 19:29.520
It's like peacocking, but on zoom, do you know what I mean?

19:29.640 --> 19:29.840
Yeah.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.400
Like zoom fronting, backgrounding.

19:32.360 --> 19:33.640
That'd be better zoom backgrounding.

19:33.640 --> 19:33.880
Yeah.

19:33.880 --> 19:36.160
Of course, most people these days just go with the virtual backgrounds.

19:36.160 --> 19:37.360
So that's, that's neat.

19:37.360 --> 19:42.120
It's a, it's an official release from the, from the project, but you know, just

19:42.120 --> 19:46.000
as an aside and maybe ultimately more important for new users, cause I played

19:46.000 --> 19:48.400
around with this and it's pretty powerful.

19:48.880 --> 19:54.000
There is a new feature that allows you to add Lovelace cards, which is the dashboard

19:54.000 --> 19:56.560
UI of home assistant by entity.

19:57.040 --> 20:03.240
And what that means is you can select a sensor or a camera feed or power source

20:03.240 --> 20:07.920
or power switch and home assistant will suss out what the functionality of that

20:07.920 --> 20:12.200
is supposed to be and automatically generate you a dashboard card for it.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.720
And so you don't have to appreciate or understand how these are constructed

20:15.720 --> 20:16.120
anymore.

20:16.120 --> 20:19.000
You just look at your entities like myself.

20:19.160 --> 20:22.720
I've never built dashboard entries for my seismic sensors.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.360
I just never got around to it.

20:25.120 --> 20:26.200
I knew the data was getting logged.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.000
I was happy with that.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.680
However, I thought, well, why, why not?

20:29.800 --> 20:31.760
I never really quite knew how to do that.

20:31.760 --> 20:36.040
So I went in by entity, selected my seismic sensors and home assistant just

20:36.360 --> 20:39.680
generated me a brilliant dashboard widget for it, a Lovelace card.

20:40.080 --> 20:40.840
And it's great.

20:40.880 --> 20:45.320
And you can do the same thing with new integrations just to get an idea of what

20:45.320 --> 20:47.160
home assistant thinks you might be able to do with them.

20:47.160 --> 20:51.280
I did that with the ring camera, which has limited functionality if you don't

20:51.280 --> 20:53.920
pay for the service, but it's still useful integrating into home assistant.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.720
And I didn't really know what you could do there.

20:55.720 --> 20:58.360
So I just added that entity and let it generate one for me.

20:58.640 --> 20:58.840
Yeah.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.640
I think we should talk more about that ring stuff in the future.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.520
There's a whole world of cloud connected stuff.

21:05.520 --> 21:08.440
It's actually pretty cool that we don't touch on that often.

21:08.720 --> 21:09.400
Yeah, I agree.

21:09.520 --> 21:11.040
Some of that cloud stuff is expensive.

21:11.040 --> 21:15.920
Like the ring products themselves, not a cheap product longterm, but they

21:15.920 --> 21:20.840
have a pretty low upfront cost and initial indications are they integrate

21:20.840 --> 21:22.240
pretty well with home assistant.

21:22.320 --> 21:26.680
If you guys are out there experimenting with that, let us know, because I do feel

21:26.680 --> 21:30.280
like it's a blind spot of ours a little bit big congratulations to the home

21:30.280 --> 21:32.360
assistant for their seventh birthday release.

21:32.440 --> 21:35.360
Huge, huge amount of work must be going into this project.

21:36.160 --> 21:41.200
I'm so glad that it exists because it just makes so many things that you would

21:41.200 --> 21:43.720
have had to buy proprietary stuff for possible.

21:43.760 --> 21:44.840
I'm so thankful.

21:44.840 --> 21:46.280
So thank you home assistant.

21:46.600 --> 21:47.800
Now let's talk about scrutiny.

21:48.200 --> 21:52.360
This is a project that could help bring visibility to something that I often

21:52.360 --> 21:53.520
forget to check in on.

21:53.760 --> 21:54.760
You think you're so smart.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.440
Oh yeah.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.240
Well, at least my hard drives do, but of course, what does it matter if nobody's

21:59.240 --> 22:00.720
ever checking their smart status?

22:00.800 --> 22:01.320
Correct.

22:01.360 --> 22:01.640
Yes.

22:01.640 --> 22:06.840
So one of our community members, Analog J has released a new tool called scrutiny.

22:07.120 --> 22:12.760
And this is designed to monitor your hard drive smart metrics, but

22:12.760 --> 22:13.960
here's the really cool part.

22:14.560 --> 22:19.360
It uses the real world failure rates published by black blaze to tell you

22:19.360 --> 22:23.440
whether that is in line with what other people who have those hard drives are

22:23.440 --> 22:23.840
seeing.

22:24.120 --> 22:24.680
Yes.

22:24.680 --> 22:30.280
And it puts it all together in a very easy to read dashboard with a brilliant

22:30.280 --> 22:30.680
layout.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.920
So it's super easy to consume the information.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.280
This is a great idea, Alex.

22:35.400 --> 22:35.960
Yeah, it is.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.600
And I nearly lost my freaking mind when I first saw this on Reddit.

22:39.640 --> 22:43.840
Analog J was asking for 25 sponsors before he made this public and open source.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.080
And he got there last week.

22:45.680 --> 22:48.920
And as soon as he went open source, one of the Linux server devs reached out to me

22:48.920 --> 22:51.800
and said, Hey, do you think we could release this as a container?

22:51.800 --> 22:56.200
So I put those two people together and they put the PB and the J in the sandwich.

22:56.200 --> 23:00.600
And there's now a Linux server container for scrutiny.

23:00.920 --> 23:04.040
Oh, so I could put this easy peasy on the studio NAS.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.160
I need to as well.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.880
Cause those drives are getting a few years old, like they're getting in that

23:07.880 --> 23:08.160
zone.

23:08.160 --> 23:13.800
So being able to compare that to the mean from black blaze, well, that's either

23:13.800 --> 23:16.600
going to make me accelerate my plan to replace them or give me some comfort.

23:16.600 --> 23:17.160
I'm not sure.

23:17.880 --> 23:19.520
Now it's still early days with the project.

23:19.520 --> 23:22.840
You know, there's still a few buttons and knobs and widgets that don't work yet.

23:22.880 --> 23:27.120
And he's adding to it all the time, but, uh, if you find it useful, go open some

23:27.120 --> 23:31.160
issues, give him some feedback, come find him in the discord, tell him what you

23:31.160 --> 23:35.400
want to see, because I think something like this is sorely needed for those of

23:35.400 --> 23:38.040
us that aren't running on raid or free NAS or something like that.

23:38.920 --> 23:41.800
And, uh, it just looks like a really great project.

23:42.080 --> 23:47.360
The UI is beautiful and the information it provides is really, really useful.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.840
So yeah, and it's using smart D on the backend.

23:49.840 --> 23:55.440
So it's getting tried and true information from smart D also, we're going to

23:55.440 --> 23:57.480
mention again this week, cloudfree.shop.

23:57.960 --> 24:00.840
Now cloudfree.shop has a wide range of smart home devices.

24:00.840 --> 24:04.760
This is a community members project that are pre flashed with Tasmota.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.160
And that means no cloud connection is ever required.

24:08.160 --> 24:12.440
It means you can just plug it in and guarantee that as long as that device

24:12.440 --> 24:14.520
operates and runs, it is under your control.

24:14.520 --> 24:17.040
There is no service that will turn it off and check this out.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.000
This is pretty great.

24:18.640 --> 24:22.120
If you use the code self-hosted to check out, you support the show.

24:22.600 --> 24:23.600
So that's pretty nice.

24:23.640 --> 24:25.240
And do they get anything special when they use that?

24:25.560 --> 24:25.800
Yeah.

24:25.800 --> 24:30.760
Since last time we've negotiated that the audience will get a dollar off per plug.

24:30.960 --> 24:31.800
Oh, per plug.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.040
So buy a whole bunch.

24:34.160 --> 24:34.760
Yeah, right.

24:35.080 --> 24:35.760
That's great.

24:35.800 --> 24:39.720
Cloudfree.shop is something that Alex and I had talked about on air.

24:39.720 --> 24:44.360
It's like, why doesn't somebody just sell these devices preloaded with Tasmota?

24:44.760 --> 24:45.720
Yeah, this is just really cool.

24:45.720 --> 24:48.720
Cloudfree.shop, Alex and I have talked about it before and wondered,

24:48.720 --> 24:50.240
why isn't somebody doing this?

24:50.480 --> 24:54.320
Get these things pre flashed with Tasmota and sell it.

24:54.880 --> 24:56.480
And it's pretty good price too.

24:58.040 --> 24:58.320
All right.

24:58.320 --> 24:59.480
Time for some feedback, I think.

24:59.480 --> 25:04.560
So Alex C writes in in the one is non episode when you were converting

25:04.560 --> 25:06.920
from ext four to butterfs Chris.

25:07.640 --> 25:12.320
I was wondering why you don't use Mosh or something like Tmux or screen.

25:12.320 --> 25:16.240
The reason I like Mosh is that it covers you if your network connection

25:16.240 --> 25:19.880
drops, or if you're roaming between wifi and mobile internet.

25:20.600 --> 25:25.240
And, and I think Alex maybe might have Mosh and Tmux slightly confused

25:25.280 --> 25:29.400
if, uh, when you read the full email, but it's a good question because a lot

25:29.400 --> 25:32.600
of mistakes were made that night, Alex, a lot of mistakes.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.320
So I generally always do use Mosh.

25:35.960 --> 25:40.200
I don't think of it typically when I'm on the land as the same machine

25:40.200 --> 25:44.080
that I'm connecting to, although I really should always just be in practice.

25:44.880 --> 25:48.080
But I think my bigger mistake honestly was not using Tmux.

25:48.520 --> 25:52.320
See Tmux would keep that session persistent, even if I completely

25:52.320 --> 25:57.360
disconnected, right, where Mosh is going to help smooth out disconnects and

25:57.360 --> 25:59.440
interruptions and changing of IP addresses.

25:59.440 --> 26:02.160
So it would have helped, but Tmux would have been the better solution.

26:02.560 --> 26:07.520
But that night I just wasn't thinking, I bet you my laptop wasn't even plugged in.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.760
I mean, I was just in a bad state.

26:09.960 --> 26:10.760
It was too late.

26:11.240 --> 26:15.560
I knew I shouldn't be doing it like in the back of my mind, but I pushed forward

26:15.560 --> 26:19.560
because I had ran out of time and I needed to get this done before we left

26:19.560 --> 26:27.120
for a trip, if I recall, and made the mistake of not taking the proper process,

26:27.120 --> 26:32.120
not taking the proper steps to make sure an SSH remote connection is absolutely

26:32.120 --> 26:35.640
as rock solid as possible when doing a major file system operation.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.360
And that's just the fundamental mistake.

26:37.360 --> 26:38.160
I know better.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.080
I knew better.

26:39.640 --> 26:42.120
Thankfully, you know, in the end I was able to recover everything.

26:42.440 --> 26:45.800
I remember Alex, how that compounded with an issue where my Google drive

26:46.040 --> 26:51.440
payment had expired because my credit card got shut down due to fraud at the

26:51.440 --> 26:52.160
same time.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.680
Oh my God, that was a nightmare.

26:54.720 --> 26:56.800
It was like the perfect storm of data loss.

26:57.320 --> 26:58.400
It was a nightmare.

26:58.800 --> 27:00.400
So like I have learned from that.

27:00.400 --> 27:05.240
I constantly check in on that stuff now because I'm, I'm

27:05.240 --> 27:09.440
paranoid that that's going to get shut down and fricking fraud happened again.

27:09.600 --> 27:15.200
Just about a month ago, my credit card was shut down again, somewhere on one

27:15.200 --> 27:19.600
of my trips, I guess somebody had copied it and then waited quite a while in

27:19.600 --> 27:22.600
Texas to try to use it, but they did eventually try to use it.

27:22.600 --> 27:26.640
So the bank cut that off and I had to go through the process all over again, but

27:26.640 --> 27:29.360
this time I made sure that Google drive was paid for.

27:29.760 --> 27:30.800
Fool me once, right?

27:30.880 --> 27:31.240
Right.

27:31.280 --> 27:31.840
Exactly.

27:31.920 --> 27:32.120
Yeah.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.000
Mosh is pretty cool.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.800
I've, I've used it a few times.

27:34.800 --> 27:38.520
Mostly when I was a consultant traveling around on the trains and stuff in England

27:38.520 --> 27:43.160
a lot, perfect for that, relying on, you know, three, three G four G connections

27:43.200 --> 27:47.880
all the time and the reason Mosh feels so nice to use is because all the key

27:47.880 --> 27:51.920
strokes are local and then it sort of sends them quietly in the background.

27:52.400 --> 27:55.800
So obviously you might, if you know, you go through a dead patch, you might

27:55.800 --> 27:59.720
have to wait for the screen to update on the result of your command.

28:00.120 --> 28:03.440
But in terms of what you're typing, which is kind of the biggest indicator

28:03.440 --> 28:08.240
of latency, it just feels really responsive and just really nice.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.840
Well, it is it's local echo.

28:09.840 --> 28:13.680
So it's, it's locally echoing back to you and then buffering it, which is so clever.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.560
That is really pretty nice.

28:16.160 --> 28:19.480
Since then, I am like so good about it.

28:19.600 --> 28:23.880
I don't know if it'll last forever, but it sort of renewed my best practices

28:23.880 --> 28:24.880
when it comes to this stuff.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.280
I was like, Oh, you know, that was the, that was my moment.

28:27.280 --> 28:28.320
That was my lesson.

28:28.320 --> 28:33.080
I managed to pull out of it, but I never want that to happen again.

28:33.080 --> 28:33.720
Absolutely.

28:33.800 --> 28:34.160
Yeah.

28:34.440 --> 28:38.160
I mean, the downside of something like Mosh is that you've got to type

28:38.200 --> 28:42.480
Mosh instead of SSH and at this point, SSH is muscle memory for me.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.640
I guess I could use a bash alias, but it also requires Mosh to be installed

28:46.640 --> 28:49.160
on the remote system, which isn't always the case.

28:49.400 --> 28:50.480
Not too hard to do.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.680
You know, it's not a whole bunch of stuff, but it is, but you have

28:53.680 --> 28:54.520
to have it on both ends.

28:54.520 --> 28:55.320
That is very true.

28:55.320 --> 28:58.240
I think Tmux, if you're not familiar with Tmux, it's worth looking into.

28:58.240 --> 29:02.440
It's a real neat trick to connect into a server, get a set, get a session running,

29:02.440 --> 29:05.440
get a whole bunch of stuff going, and then you can just disconnect and it keeps

29:05.440 --> 29:05.960
running.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.960
It's a great way to pair program as well, because if you open two Tmux

29:08.960 --> 29:12.960
sessions on two different systems, they will both update in real time with the

29:12.960 --> 29:13.480
same thing.

29:13.800 --> 29:14.920
Yeah, that's pretty nice.

29:14.920 --> 29:19.640
Um, we actually even just use it just recently, Wes and I were messing around

29:19.640 --> 29:22.840
with recording audio from the command line and we just use it for working on

29:22.840 --> 29:23.560
that kind of stuff.

29:23.560 --> 29:28.960
It's great. So I, I know better anyways, I will, I won't, it won't happen again.

29:28.960 --> 29:29.320
I promise.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.600
But if it does, I will admit it to you guys.

29:31.640 --> 29:32.800
I will come clean on the show.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.200
Yeah, yeah, sure.

29:36.520 --> 29:40.800
In future episodes, we're going to take a look at some container dashboards and

29:40.840 --> 29:45.840
maybe a look at Caddy, which is another alternative to traffic as a reverse

29:45.840 --> 29:46.360
proxy.

29:46.920 --> 29:50.800
But in the meantime, I think it's time we thanked our site reliability engineers.

29:50.800 --> 29:51.400
Don't you, Chris?

29:51.760 --> 29:52.000
Yep.

29:52.000 --> 29:57.200
Last episode, we launched the self-hosted site reliability engineers membership.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.560
The folks that help keep this show sustainable, reliable, and fully

30:00.560 --> 30:01.360
operational.

30:01.680 --> 30:05.200
I think we still have some early bird SSH codes too.

30:05.200 --> 30:08.440
If you use the promo code SSH, it takes a little bit of money off.

30:08.440 --> 30:12.400
So the membership is even, I think a dollar cheaper and you can go to self

30:12.400 --> 30:17.000
hosted.show slash SRE to get there and just put the promo code SSH in there.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.400
We've got more show for our members.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.760
We're doing a bonus to post show with every single episode, and we're also

30:22.760 --> 30:25.240
doing a limited ad feed for that episode.

30:25.480 --> 30:30.240
So it gives you a whole new RSS feed for the show, a fully produced limited

30:30.240 --> 30:33.640
ad with additional bonus content.

30:33.720 --> 30:37.440
And that's a thank you to the site reliability engineers who are keeping

30:37.440 --> 30:38.160
the show going.

30:38.640 --> 30:40.240
So big thank you to everybody out there.

30:40.240 --> 30:43.640
And Alex and I are already cooking up new ideas for future membership

30:43.640 --> 30:44.640
content as well.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.760
Self-hosted.show slash SRE.

30:47.360 --> 30:47.840
Thank you.

30:47.840 --> 30:49.640
Everybody it's pretty cool, Alex.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.160
You know, it's pretty nice seeing that come in because going independent

30:52.160 --> 30:56.120
again is scary, but also awesome at the same time.

30:56.120 --> 30:59.600
And it's, it's a great representation of audience support too, but we totally

30:59.600 --> 31:01.960
understand not everybody can afford a membership.

31:01.960 --> 31:02.960
That's totally cool.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.480
Just listening to the show.

31:04.480 --> 31:07.120
And if maybe a sponsor seems like the right fit or there's somebody you

31:07.120 --> 31:08.280
think you could share the show with.

31:08.760 --> 31:10.680
We really appreciate that support too.

31:11.080 --> 31:13.320
Word of mouth is the best marketing.

31:13.320 --> 31:16.520
There is it's like the only marketing that works for me.

31:16.520 --> 31:19.280
It's the only marketing that works for podcasts.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.280
It really is.

31:20.280 --> 31:21.280
Mm-hmm.

31:21.640 --> 31:25.520
Quick follow up from last episode where Chris, you talked about having to run

31:25.520 --> 31:28.200
home to pull in your awning because it got too windy.

31:28.440 --> 31:30.440
We had a few recommendations from the audience.

31:30.840 --> 31:30.960
Yeah.

31:30.960 --> 31:31.760
A couple of people.

31:31.760 --> 31:34.720
And I think you and I thought of this right after we wrapped up recommended

31:34.720 --> 31:37.640
the Shelly that crossed our mind as well.

31:37.960 --> 31:42.360
But Brian Davenport wrote in with a neat idea of essentially a little wind

31:42.360 --> 31:48.880
gauge that would transmit on the 433 megahertz band and it would send the

31:48.880 --> 31:53.280
speed to a decoder device that decoder device would monitor the speed.

31:53.280 --> 31:57.080
And when it reached a certain percentage or whatever, a certain speed

31:57.080 --> 32:00.960
number, it would then trigger a whole sensor switch and close that, which

32:00.960 --> 32:01.960
would then retract it.

32:02.640 --> 32:05.120
The other idea that I had was just check the weather in the morning.

32:07.120 --> 32:07.880
Come on.

32:08.560 --> 32:08.880
I know.

32:08.880 --> 32:09.760
No, it's not good enough.

32:09.760 --> 32:13.240
Well, and you know, what's funny Alex is today as we're recording a

32:13.240 --> 32:17.080
construction truck backed up into the pole that has our power transformer

32:17.160 --> 32:18.640
and knocked it over.

32:18.960 --> 32:22.160
And now we have no power, which is fine because we've got plenty of

32:22.160 --> 32:23.120
battery and solar.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.480
The thing is, is nobody's home.

32:25.760 --> 32:29.800
We may have left the air conditioning set to automatically kick in and that'll

32:29.800 --> 32:31.160
drain the batteries pretty quick.

32:31.600 --> 32:34.960
And so I got thinking, it's like, you know, what I need is I need the system

32:34.960 --> 32:37.920
to know when it's in a limited power state.

32:37.920 --> 32:41.280
And I go back to, I know we have a couple of audience members out there

32:41.280 --> 32:45.480
who are pulling this state information from their Victron devices and feeding

32:45.480 --> 32:46.400
it into home assistant.

32:46.880 --> 32:51.120
And I remember somebody hooked up a Raspberry Pi to pull in the information

32:51.360 --> 32:53.960
and then essentially MQTT it to home assistance.

32:53.960 --> 32:57.240
But I don't recall the details, but all this started flooding back to me

32:57.240 --> 33:01.720
when I think about, is there anything I could do to tell the system, Hey,

33:01.720 --> 33:03.080
now you're in battery mode.

33:03.080 --> 33:05.280
Why don't you turn some crap off?

33:06.400 --> 33:07.360
Seems so obvious.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.600
It seems like you need to have your air conditioning on a remote

33:10.600 --> 33:13.160
control as a, as a starting point.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.000
Yeah, I do.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.720
And it's tricky because I don't think it's like a household air conditioner,

33:17.720 --> 33:17.920
right?

33:17.920 --> 33:21.080
It's a furnace, a fan and AC.

33:21.360 --> 33:23.200
And I imagine it's all DC wiring.

33:24.080 --> 33:26.560
So I'm not, I'm not sure what my options are there either.

33:26.600 --> 33:27.400
You know, it's just one of those things.

33:27.400 --> 33:31.960
I think the step one is take the panel off the wall and see what the wires are.

33:32.160 --> 33:36.520
You know, when we launched this show, the world was still normal and I was planning

33:36.520 --> 33:37.720
to come out and see you in April.

33:37.720 --> 33:39.600
And we were going to do a whole bunch of these projects.

33:39.680 --> 33:40.200
Yeah.

33:40.200 --> 33:40.440
Yeah.

33:40.440 --> 33:43.400
Oh, I just want to come out and do half of this stuff for you.

33:43.840 --> 33:46.320
I know it would be great because we could record it.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.200
You know, I can learn a bunch from you.

33:48.200 --> 33:51.240
You could see how I do some of my crazy setups and the things I'm trying to solve

33:51.240 --> 33:51.720
for.

33:51.760 --> 33:52.640
It would be a lot of fun.

33:52.880 --> 33:55.120
We could try and not get pulled over in the mountains.

33:57.040 --> 33:58.520
We definitely could do that.

33:58.560 --> 33:59.800
That would be a lot of fun.

34:00.440 --> 34:03.040
In the meantime, thank you to everyone who sent in some suggestions.

34:03.040 --> 34:06.640
If you have Leet Victron knowledge, I would like to pick your brain.

34:06.640 --> 34:10.360
So maybe that's my next ask, because we just have the best community ever.

34:10.840 --> 34:15.160
Self hosted dot show slash contact, or if you'd like to jump on the discord, self

34:15.160 --> 34:16.280
hosted dot show slash discord.

34:16.680 --> 34:19.760
Victron always sounds like it should be like a transformer or something.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.600
It is pretty cool equipment.

34:21.600 --> 34:27.080
And the neat thing is I kind of made a bet on this and wasn't sure cause I'd never

34:27.080 --> 34:31.280
used any of their equipment before, but I got to say very, very, very satisfied

34:31.280 --> 34:31.960
with the purchase.

34:31.960 --> 34:38.200
It it's an inverter, charge controller and converter, and it is so smooth.

34:38.280 --> 34:44.120
I can switch between multiple different power sources and nothing blips.

34:44.160 --> 34:45.800
All of my gear stays on.

34:46.440 --> 34:47.320
It's great.

34:47.360 --> 34:48.600
It's really clean and smooth.

34:48.600 --> 34:49.920
It produces clean power.

34:49.960 --> 34:50.680
Just very happy.

34:51.280 --> 34:55.120
Well, now that we're at the end of the show, I'll mention my website, Chris last

34:55.120 --> 34:58.920
dot com Alex's website, blog dot KTZ dot me.

34:59.160 --> 35:01.280
Well, you can find our sponsor on social media too.

35:01.280 --> 35:04.760
A cloud guru is at twitter.com, youtube.com and facebook.com.

35:04.760 --> 35:07.520
They're all just slash a cloud guru couldn't be easier.

35:07.760 --> 35:10.400
And the podcast here is also on Twitter self-hosted show.

35:10.400 --> 35:31.400
I'm at ironic Badger and that was self-hosted dot show slash 28.
