00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 31 for March 11th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's doing everything it can to switch every single user to Linux.

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
My name is Chris.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
My name is Matt.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hey there, Matt. Welcome to Episode 31, buddy.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This week, I want to talk a little bit about something you wrote a great piece on DataMation about,

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and that is, are Ubuntu haters pushing away Linux switchers, potential Linux switchers?

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Are those people scaring away people that are looking into Linux with a lot of hate and things like that?

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And I recall from when I switched to Arch, I ran into a lot of that.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Did you experience that, Matt, during our Arch challenge?

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh yeah, definitely.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
A lot of like, do it this way, don't do it that way.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah, I like to call it Arch think.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I think it was basically they had a pattern of thought that worked for them,

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and they expect you to adhere to that pattern of thought or screw you.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yeah, and if you don't do it that way, there's something wrong with you.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah, I mean, it's gotten a little better over time, but it's still there.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But I think in the context of Arch, I think that's given the community a little bit of a bad rep in some sense,

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
is that particular kind of behavior.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And I think kind of this point in the Linux community, Ubuntu haters,

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
drinking the Ubuntu Hater Aid is kind of like it's world famous now.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Everybody's in on it. Everybody knows an Ubuntu hater.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
A lot of us are Ubuntu haters.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm pretty neutral. I know Matt's pretty neutral, too.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But you do have to think about it in the context of people's first impressions

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and how that sort of forms their opinion about the Linux community.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And I think that's going to be interesting in sort of the shadow of this Sunday's laughs.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Here we are a year after the announcement of Mir.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And we're going to break down some of the things that have made people kind of upset with Canonical,

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and I think Mir is one of them.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So I think it's a perfect time to talk about this in light of that.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But first, Matt, it is tradition to start with the feedback.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And we got a lot of feedback last week about replacing Exchange.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We've been talking about what's preventing people from switching to Linux from a technical standpoint, right?

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Collaboration software, AutoCAD.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Big one.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, games, just general education about the existence of Linux and the options there.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
There's been a lot of things, ease of use, that we've covered on this show

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
that we think are preventing people from switching to Linux.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The groupware thing has definitely been one of them.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So this couple of emails we're going to do will sort of wrap up that discussion

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
around the technical stuff, and this week we'll sort of kick off the discussion

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
around the community stuff, the people stuff.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So we'll start with an email from Dwayne.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He wrote into the show responding to the whole groupware thing.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He says, hi there, Chris and Matt.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Well, hi, Dwayne.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Good to talk to you.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He said, I listened to Linux Unplugged and I heard you mention Colab and Zimbra

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
as possible solutions for your office.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
While you're at it, check out Univention.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's meant to be an open source replacement for folks who don't want to use Microsoft software solutions

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
to start with or are moving away from them.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He says, thanks again for the sweet show.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I use BitTorrent to get all the shows.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Can't risk missing any of them.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And he includes a link to Univention.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's univention.com, and they have a small business edition,

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and it's sort of like a drop-in exchange replacement.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh, I like that.

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Especially if it is truly drop-in and you can just kind of slide into that.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's fantastic.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Now, I think he's using Thunderbird as his front end.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We heard from a few folks that sent in different stuff,

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
but this was kind of a popular one.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Another one on the topic of the exchange replacement, Kevin writes, and he says,

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hey, Chris and Matt, you asked what people did for email contacts and calendars,

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
so I figured I'd share my open system with you.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Basically, I use IMAP, Cal Dev, and Card Dev to access my mail contacts, etc.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I originally used Google for all of the above,

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
but migrated away as they shut down Cal Dev and Card Dev support.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He says, I still use them for my email, though.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Now, the other two reside on my local own cloud server.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is great because I'm using only open standards,

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and everything stays in sync across my laptop, desktop, and phone.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Also, because of the protocols I use, it is easy to migrate between services

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
if I decide I don't like them for whatever reason.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Now, no need to change applications or workflow, just change the host.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
For clients, I use Thunderbird on my computers,

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and my apps on my Android provide Card Dev and Cal Dev backends for Android Sync,

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
allowing it to work with all apps.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I use the Gmail app on Android, that's the only non-free part of this setup,

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
but I also have used K9 in the past.

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Cheers, Kevin.

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This is interesting.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's not a full solution because he still uses Gmail for his email part.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
True, true.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But I know open cloud is a popular solution for this.

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think it's an interesting approach.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I mean, if he's able to make it work, and he's able to make it work for him,

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
as he builds his stuff out, it's still working for him, then I think he has a winner.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I do dig his point about how because he's using IMAP and Cal Dev and Card Dev,

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
the backend is really sort of just an implementation detail,

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and he can swap that out to another system if he decides for some reason

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
that own cloud isn't doing the business for him anymore.

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's a great point.

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's actually an excellent point.

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Didn't own cloud just have an update like today?

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I believe so.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's go check.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think, I'm not sure, but I think own cloud 6 just shipped today.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I have to go over to owncloud.org and take a look.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But I've been considering using something like own cloud.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
There's a few other alternatives that I want to review soon on the Linux Action Show

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
that look like they're really good systems.

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So I'm thinking about maybe doing a couple of like a roundup of like the one I really like,

107
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and then maybe I'll even deploy to the new studio.

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That's kind of the goal I'm shooting for.

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That would be awesome to have this totally, because it's not starting out completely fresh,

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
but it kind of is because it's at a new locale.

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You can actually start everything the way you wanted it from the get-go.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The own cloud site isn't loading right now, so I don't know if they had it.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Maybe that's a sign that they did have an update because right now I'm just getting a blank page

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
and it's just waiting for owncloud.org.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But I think version 6, I want to say version 6 came out today.

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Maybe the chat room knows. They can let us know.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
All right, Matt.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Well, let's see. We'll give that own cloud site a second to load here,

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and I'll say thanks to one of our sponsors this week, and that is ting.com.

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Get started by being proud and going to linux.ting.com.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's right. Represent.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You got to go shout it out, you guys, linux.ting.com.

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What is Ting?

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Well, I'll tell you what Ting is. Ting is no BS mobile service.

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's simple. It's straightforward. It's mobile. It makes sense. No contract.

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You only pay for what you use, flat $6 per line plus taxes.

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And then it's just your usage on top of that.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Ting takes your minutes, your messages, your megabytes.

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
They add it all up. Whatever bucket you fall into at the end of the month,

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
that's what you pay.

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Every Ting plan includes hotspot and tethering.

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
For me, this is so awesome because right now as we're setting up the studio,

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
there's no internet there.

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And it is so weird to be in a building for hours at a time

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and not have internet access.

136
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'll just be honest with you. You can't do it.

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It hurts on the inside.

138
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So what's so great about Ting is if I want hotspot or tethering,

139
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
let me just check the box on Android.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That feature that Google built in for a reason?

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah, you just check that box. No special plan.

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't get in trouble for not having a data plan.

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't have to have a family share, whatever.

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's just part of my data usage.

145
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And Ting makes it super easy to monitor where my data usage is at

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
with their awesome intuitive control panel.

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I can go in there and manage all of my devices,

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
disable, enable, activate devices, set up alerting,

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
set up call forwarding or voicemail options.

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You can really take control of your Ting account

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and ultimately your own bill.

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's very straightforward, plain language billing.

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
When you see that bill, you know exactly what's going on.

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
There's no surprises.

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
They also have companion iOS and Android apps

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
to manage your Ting account right from an app on the device.

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And Ting has no hold customer support.

158
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You can call them between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. or 8 p.m. Eastern

159
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and just call them at 1-855-846-4389

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and a real person just answers the phone.

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You don't have to go through some sort of call tree or something.

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Well, isn't it great that you can walk into this brand new studio

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
that's still being very much set up?

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I mean, it's still in disarray for the most part.

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And you have internet out of the box.

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You don't have to worry about it.

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Boom, done.

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's super nice.

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's internet in my pocket and it's actually really great internet.

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And today, as Ting is announcing,

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
if you have a Sprint-compatible iPhone 5,

172
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
you can now activate it on Ting.

173
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Or you can grab one if you just want to go get a new one from Ting,

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
whichever you prefer.

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
This is great because I know not everybody in our audience

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
is an Android lover.

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And the iPhone 5 is a great device for iOS users.

178
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And now you can use it right there on Ting.

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Or you can buy, they partner, Ting will partner up with Glide

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and you can go through them to get a used device,

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
to get it at a great price.

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If you've already got one, you can bring it over.

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And if you're in a contract,

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Ting has an early termination relief program.

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
They'll pay up to $75 per line that you had to get canceled.

186
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
They'll apply that to your account.

187
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Now, average Ting bill before taxes is like 21 bucks a month per line.

188
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I think mine is about 30, 35 bucks right now.

189
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah, so $75 credit, that gave me quite a ways.

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yeah, definitely.

191
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I know it.

192
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, and I think you're talking about people that want to use iPhone.

193
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I think it's important to remember that while a lot of us may be Android people,

194
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
we may have family members that we're bringing onto Ting with us

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
that perhaps would like to use iPhone.

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And we very much do.

197
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes.

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And we very much thank Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

199
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Linux.ting.com, you guys.

200
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Go check it out.

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Just visiting there lets them know that you appreciate them

202
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
supporting the Linux Unplugged show.

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And plus, it's pretty cool that we got Linux.

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Hey, oh, there we go.

205
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
OwnCloud 6, yes.

206
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The OwnCloud site loaded.

207
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Nice.

208
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And OwnCloud 6 is out today.

209
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's something we're going to have to check out.

210
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll put this on my list for Sunday to do some research on

211
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and maybe even download it and check it out.

212
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I think it's worth checking out.

213
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yeah, there have been some reports that there's some bugs in the new features

214
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and things like that, but it might be worth looking into.

215
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah, I'll do some digging.

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'll dig around.

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So if anybody has any experiences, please share those in the

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
linuxactionshow.reddit.com subreddit.

219
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And we'll incorporate all that into our feedback on Sunday.

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay, so Friar Tuck wrote in Matt, and this is sort of just rounding out

221
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
our coverage on the technical limitations for people switching to Linux.

222
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's the other popular one, AutoCAD.

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
He says, Hello, Chris and Matt.

224
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I've heard you both mention in passing that lack of AutoCAD solutions

225
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
is a major drawback to Linux.

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, I'm a CAD technician who provides IT support in my office as needed.

227
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
When I hear your discussions about the enterprise Linux adoption,

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I can't help but apply the issues to my own office.

229
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It seems to me that my office could get by fine in the Linux space

230
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
except for certain engineering-related software,

231
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
mostly Autodesk and Bentley software.

232
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'd love to see a show dedicated to available CAD solutions under Linux.

233
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I've heard of Blender, but that seems to be mostly for digital animation applications.

234
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But what else is out there?

235
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Also, I'm learning about Steam streaming for CAD solutions.

236
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Thanks so much for all the great informative content.

237
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm new to Linux in general.

238
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh, that's great.

239
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
My crowning achievement so far has been getting Ubuntu up and running on my old MacBook.

240
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Nice. Good for him.

241
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
LUP has been his gateway. I like that.

242
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Hey, audience.

243
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If you guys know of some AutoCAD replacements,

244
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I know there's some stuff out there, but this is just not my area.

245
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't really know a lot about CAD software

246
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
outside of really the AutoCAD commercial solution.

247
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Well, and someone that can help us look at the available options and say,

248
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay, Chris and I, they look the same.

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Really, I can't make heads or tails out of one versus another,

250
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
but if someone can help us understand what the benefits of one versus another are,

251
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
or whether one's more stable, runs better, one's on Java, one's not, whatever it may be.

252
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah, that's exactly it. Perfectly put.

253
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
They all just look the same to me.

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's like, okay, well, I see there's some sort of CAD thing here.

255
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I can draw stuff. I mean, I don't really know what I'm doing with it.

256
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yeah.

257
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Do you remember last week, at the end of the episode, we had an email from Scott,

258
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and Scott was a little concerned about the amount of commercial software

259
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
now coming over to Linux and sort of taking Linux

260
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
and sort of perverting it into this closed-off, commercial, money-making platform.

261
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Well, Mark wrote back to reply to Scott, and he said,

262
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Regarding the discussion about whether we should be happy with proprietary games on Linux,

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
here's how I see it.

264
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And I think Mark nails the way I see it, too.

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
He says, My system, utilities, and application software, I want that to be free.

266
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If I'm browsing the web, if I'm editing documents, etc.,

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I want the code open to inspection, improvement, forking in case of developing it or going away,

268
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
or maybe the development turning bad.

269
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But my entertainment, I don't care.

270
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If I watch a movie, if I've got no interest in having access to the raw footage to make my own cut,

271
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't have any interest in making my own raw cuts of it.

272
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If I play a game, same deal.

273
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's a piece of entertainment that I'm paying for as a complete article.

274
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If the license allows me to be entertained by it,

275
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and the price is proportionate to the amount of entertainment I get, then that's fine.

276
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Cheers, Mark.

277
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That's exactly how I see it.

278
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
For Steam games, to me, that is not as important as the system utilities

279
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
and the day-to-day applications that I have to have to actually work,

280
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and I need to be able to have trust in.

281
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
For me, it's sort of like buying a movie theater ticket.

282
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, I think I'm going to equate that, because it's exactly the movie theater ticket thing.

283
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's like the rule, you can't bring in your own food and drink.

284
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That doesn't feel very open, does it?

285
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But at the end of the day, if you think about it, we're choosing to go there to do this.

286
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We could very well wait for it to come to the Blu-ray.

287
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's fine, or however we may get it.

288
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But the point of the thing is that that's exactly it.

289
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The fact that the movie is available for us for our entertainment,

290
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
it's not a critical piece of our life.

291
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's not a critical piece of our job or our ability to do stuff at home.

292
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah, I would agree with that.

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah, that's why for me, I kind of have this, meh, not a big deal for games.

294
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But I love the fact that my entire desktop environment is open source.

295
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Our last bit of email this week, Mike writes in, he says,

296
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hey guys, first of all, thanks for the awesome show.

297
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I listened to Linux Unplugged and Last, and I love it.

298
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I just thought I'd quickly share with you one of your sponsors,

299
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
pleasantly surprised me today.

300
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I signed up with Digital Ocean a few weeks back.

301
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I had heard of them on your show.

302
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Being me, I forgot to use your promo code.

303
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Uh oh.

304
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
He said, so anyways, I was able to go back in and edit my order,

305
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
figuring I'd probably missed out on it, but why not give it a shot anyways.

306
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He said, I went in there, applied it, and to my surprise,

307
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
they actually still applied the discount.

308
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Oh wow.

309
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yeah, he says, yeah, when you're in there, there's a promo code field

310
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
in your account settings, and you can apply the discount.

311
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And he says he's been rocking his Digital Ocean droplet ever since then.

312
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So why don't I stop right here before we get into the rest of the show

313
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
and thank Digital Ocean, our second and last sponsor this week,

314
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
here on Linux Unplugged.

315
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What is Digital Ocean?

316
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Digital Ocean is simple cloud hosting.

317
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
They're dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

318
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
to spin up a cloud server.

319
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds or 44 seconds,

320
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
like some of our audience.

321
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't think anybody's beat that yet.

322
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I think 44 is the record.

323
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And pricing plans start at only $5 a month,

324
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
which gets you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD,

325
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
one CPU, and a terabyte, yes, a terabyte of transfer.

326
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And that's a fixed cost.

327
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Boom, $5.

328
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You know exactly what you're going to get.

329
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And that's so perfect because it's way more than enough machine

330
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
to do a ton of the things you want to do,

331
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
like host an own cloud 6 installation or a BitTorrent sync installation

332
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
or a card dev server, whatever it might be.

333
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's more than enough.

334
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I've been running an Archbox up there for months now,

335
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and the performance is outstanding.

336
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Plus DigitalOcean has locations in New York, San Francisco,

337
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Amsterdam, and now even Singapore.

338
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
They have a simple interface, very intuitive control panel.

339
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Power users can replicate that control panel on a larger scale

340
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
using the straightforward API.

341
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And I want you to get it with a $10 credit

342
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
so you can try out that $5 box for two months for free.

343
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
And trust me, this is a great way to learn something.

344
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You will find something to do with this.

345
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I sure have, and I love it.

346
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Just use the promo code LINUXUNPLUGGEDMARCH.

347
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
LINUXUNPLUGGEDMARCH, all one word, $10 credit.

348
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You can try the $5 machine for two months,

349
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and you will really be impressed.

350
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The clean, easy-to-use control panel is absolutely excellent.

351
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The Droplet system makes sense.

352
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
If you've ever worked with VirtualBox at all

353
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and you understand the concept of snapshots,

354
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
you're going to totally get this system.

355
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
They make it really easy to back up your box

356
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
before you make any changes to template off that.

357
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You can have auto backup and snapshots.

358
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You can one-click install WordPress

359
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
or one-click install Ruby on Rails.

360
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You can deploy an Ubuntu box,

361
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
1204 with LAMP or Docker or a Fedora box,

362
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
whatever it might be, in 55 seconds, too, guys.

363
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You can do this in just no time.

364
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If you've only got a couple of hours a day

365
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
or a week even to experiment with this kind of stuff,

366
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
this is how you can do it.

367
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You don't have to set up a whole rig in your house.

368
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You don't even have to funky around with virtualization software

369
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
on your own machine.

370
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
For $5 a month, and, heck, with LINUXUNPLUGGEDMARCH,

371
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
we're going to get you two months,

372
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
you can just play around, get a machine up there,

373
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
make a snapshot of it before you try something cray-cray,

374
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and if it barks it, just revert back from that snapshot.

375
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's like being able to run your own Linux server

376
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
with training wheels, and nothing's going to go wrong.

377
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And that's what makes it great for production as well,

378
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
because if you ever have something up in production

379
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
on DigitalOcean, why wouldn't you?

380
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
They have tier one bandwidth, those SSD hard drives scream,

381
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
the KVM virtualization is awesome, we all know that,

382
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
and it's backed by amazing hardware.

383
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So why wouldn't you throw it into production?

384
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And now you have that safety net.

385
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
If something goes wrong on your production server

386
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
up in the cloud that you have root access to,

387
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
that runs whatever distribution you want,

388
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
one click and you're back up and running.

389
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And you can try it all for two months for free,

390
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
LINUXUNPLUGGEDMARCH, and a big thank you

391
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
to DigitalOcean for sponsoring LINUXUNPLUGGED.

392
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I mean, two months for free, it actually costs you money

393
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
not to try it at that point.

394
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And it costs you your soul.

395
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm just saying, okay Matt, before we go on,

396
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
we've got a Valve update real quick.

397
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
We've got to talk a little bit about this,

398
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
like it's storming the internets right now

399
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
as we're recording this show.

400
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Valve has announced they're going to solve all of our problems.

401
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Never fear Linux users, they have released a direct 3D

402
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
to OpenGL transition layer.

403
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Everybody go home, job's done.

404
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Is that right Wizard, or did I get something wrong there?

405
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Exactly what you think it is.

406
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's actually going to be something that you can add

407
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
to your actual project after the fact

408
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
to bring something else up to date.

409
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
So it's going to be something like,

410
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I can apply to X old game to go and make it

411
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
so that I can run it on Linux.

412
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's not going to be something that everyone just

413
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
installs in their repository and it's going to be

414
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
this magic wine fix that's going to replace for it.

415
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I was going to say, it almost sounds like wine then.

416
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
No, it's not going to be something that you,

417
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
it only goes and translates the DirectX calls

418
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
to OpenGL calls.

419
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's like the project itself is called 2GL.

420
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
If you want to look at it, it's on GitHub right now

421
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
under the Valve software.

422
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That's pretty cool.

423
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Have you been taking a look at it?

424
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Yes, I have.

425
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's all written in C++, so it's very readable.

426
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So this isn't really going to, I mean,

427
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
now that you've kind of brought me up to date on it,

428
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
it kind of seems like, I guess this is one more,

429
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
what's that?

430
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I kind of find it, it's nice, but it's a little bit overhyped.

431
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Exactly, that's exactly what I was going to say.

432
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And I was kind of playing to that,

433
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
that whole overhyped aspect of it, but it's neat.

434
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's neat and I'm glad to see Valve open sourcing software.

435
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Absolutely.

436
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What was the license?

437
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Is it GPL?

438
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Good question.

439
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I didn't look.

440
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Oh, okay.

441
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yeah, I don't see it right here on their page either,

442
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
but I know they have a license file,

443
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
so I'll go jump in there.

444
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I bet you the license file will tell you.

445
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But all right, well, thanks, Wizard.

446
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'll toss you back up to the main room

447
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and we'll join the main room too.

448
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I want to kick around something that came out on the web today.

449
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You guys probably saw this.

450
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Will Wheaton took to Google Plus

451
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and made Mark Shuttleworth cry

452
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
when he announced that he's not crazy

453
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
about the direction Ubuntu is taking.

454
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
In fact, the exact quote that Will Wheaton said was,

455
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
yeah, I'm not crazy about Ubuntu.

456
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I feel like the entire project has gone in a direction

457
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
that isn't for me.

458
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Does that mean that Sheldon likes Ubuntu?

459
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yes, the big bang joke started immediately, yes.

460
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Okay, exactly.

461
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He went on to say,

462
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I love just about everything about my MacBook Pro

463
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and my iMac,

464
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
so I don't see myself going to Linux full-time again.

465
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But I really do love being able to explore

466
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
tons of open source packages

467
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
and play with different kernel options, desktops,

468
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and all those things that I need to do,

469
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
all those things that I don't need to do,

470
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
but still have fun doing anyway.

471
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Being a hipster intensifies.

472
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Well, and it's defense.

473
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I've actually, you know, I've met him before,

474
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
and I will tell you, he's an old-school Linux guy.

475
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He's actually waded through it.

476
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
He's slack-weared with the best of them,

477
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
but he did kind of evolve into kind of a Mac mindset,

478
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
if you will, over time.

479
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So he did his time in Linux.

480
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's not like he's some passive guy

481
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
just coming through and talking smack.

482
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I think that Linux community's pride

483
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
blinds them from seeing the real threat.

484
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I think maybe we also still see Microsoft as the threat,

485
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
but I think the reality is the real competition is Apple.

486
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I think they have compelling hardware that people,

487
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
a lot of people like, not everybody.

488
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The fact that they can sell so many computers

489
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
without Ethernet ports blows my mind,

490
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
but it's a thing, apparently.

491
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And they offer sort of at least the idea

492
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
of a turnkey computing solution.

493
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And I think that is, I want to sort of keep that in mind

494
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
as we talk about the overall Linux community's abrasiveness

495
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
sometimes when it comes to issues that they're passionate about.

496
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
And Matt, you touched on this in an article you wrote

497
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
for DataMation saying, is Ubuntu animosity misplaced?

498
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Kind of from a high level, like, what's the concept here?

499
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Basically, I'm looking at it from this perspective.

500
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And I always take the Ubuntu perspective for two reasons.

501
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
One, it's what my editor would prefer.

502
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And secondly, it still covers most of the Linux universe

503
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
just by default anyway,

504
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
so it's really a mood issue in that regard.

505
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But the point is that a lot of people come into Linux,

506
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
and people I introduce to Linux, they go to the forums,

507
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
they go to these different places,

508
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
or especially on the social media sites,

509
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
and they see a lot of real negative behavior.

510
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I mean, it's really unfortunate.

511
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
The kind of stuff you would expect to see in a Windows forum.

512
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You know, you like to think you got away from that,

513
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
but in the Linux space it can be really prevalent

514
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
for a lot of people to turn off.

515
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But also going deeper than that, I feel like that,

516
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
so what got these people to that mindset in the first place?

517
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And a lot of it does come down to Unity,

518
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
other aspects of Ubuntu as well.

519
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I mean, just really nailed it on the list.

520
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You did a good job.

521
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You said Ubuntu simply needed to give Unity more time

522
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and development before releasing it.

523
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Because of that, it got a big backlash from the community.

524
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Simply put, you said,

525
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I believe some folks within the Linux community

526
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
felt like Ubuntu was isolating itself with this move to Unity.

527
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I think that's probably a fair point.

528
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That caused some hurt feelings,

529
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
or maybe hurt feelings is the right way to put it,

530
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
but it caused people to take sides.

531
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And then you said, down the road,

532
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
you had the Mir versus Whalen debacle,

533
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
which we're very familiar with.

534
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
When it was first announced,

535
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Mir was to be Ubuntu's choice for Xorg's replacement.

536
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Once again, the Linux community sounded off.

537
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
At the time, I took a stance on the matter that explaining,

538
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I took a stance on the matter explaining

539
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
that if Mir didn't get at least one additional distro

540
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
to use it as a display option,

541
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I would wear a monkey suit for the masses,

542
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
unless, well, it's 12 months later,

543
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
and I've lost the bet,

544
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm prepared to pay the price initially agreed upon.

545
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Now for the bitter pill.

546
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You don't want to hear.

547
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The casual computer user couldn't care less about the issue.

548
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
So long as the applications work as expected,

549
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I suspect we'll be seeing shrugs of indifference

550
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
throughout the Ubuntu masses.

551
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
No, I see this as a battle of wills

552
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
between developers and their opposing views,

553
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and I think you nailed it there.

554
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yep.

555
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And I think if you look at Will Wheaton, what he just said,

556
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
he couldn't give two craps about Whalen versus Mir.

557
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
And he also defeats the thing

558
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
that it's only new users that don't care.

559
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
He is not a new user by any stretch.

560
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
That's a great point.

561
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So I think this is something we've got to appreciate

562
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
is people, you know, as their lives get busy,

563
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
just because they might not be,

564
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
they might be technical people,

565
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
but they might just decide that they don't have time for drama

566
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
or they don't have time to follow this kind of stuff.

567
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And that can be a whole off-putting thing in itself.

568
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And you say the back and forth was perhaps even more heated

569
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
than we'd seen than the Unity versus Gnome challenges in the past.

570
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Like the Mir versus Whalen thing was,

571
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
like every time they've had something,

572
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
that event has been more hotly contentious than the one before it.

573
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
That's true.

574
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And it seems to be like the animosity is building on itself

575
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
and building on itself,

576
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
and it's like this snowball that just keeps rolling.

577
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And then, of course, we get into the whole Upstart

578
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
versus system de-discussion,

579
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
which, you know, Canonical and Ubuntu weren't directly involved in,

580
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
but you say unlike the Unity versus Mir debate,

581
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Upstart got the attention of a fresh new crop of Linux users

582
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
as it directly affected how a Linux distro starts and stops events and services.

583
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
So even if you're not a system admin or a developer,

584
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
this affected anyone who uses Linux on a day-to-day basis.

585
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Definitely.

586
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
And I noticed a lot of people that normally wouldn't care

587
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
one way or the other about desktop environments or whatnot

588
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
because they just use something else.

589
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
This affected them more so because it was under the hood.

590
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
It's going to change how they do things.

591
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And you said, of course, the CLA at its core,

592
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
the CLA is perceived as a barrier among many developers within the Linux community.

593
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You mentioned Linus Torvalds expressed his displeasure with all CLAs in all forms.

594
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And, you know, that's been a real concern for some developers.

595
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And you mentioned in your closing thoughts that the Linux community

596
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
is passionate, involved, and sometimes overtly loud

597
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
when it comes to the direction the platform is headed in.

598
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
That you say, while users such as myself try hard to remain neutral

599
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
and not act as though using our computers is a religious experience,

600
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
the community at large continues to make their voices heard no matter the cost.

601
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Now, what do you think that cost is?

602
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I think a lot of times the cost is that we create unnecessary contention between each other.

603
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I think a lot of times that we become so focused on stupid stuff

604
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
that we really lose focus of what's going on in other areas.

605
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
For example, let's look at the Chromebooks and how Chrome's doing its thing

606
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and these things are selling really well and whatnot.

607
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Rather than focusing on outdoing Apple, outdoing Google, outdoing other stuff,

608
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I feel like we focus on our internal squabbles so much

609
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
that it really not only doesn't solve anything,

610
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
it just makes us dig deeper into our own personal camps,

611
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
but we ignore bigger issues.

612
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I'm not sure if you're thinking about it right,

613
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
because there's a lot of things that are huge deals,

614
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
like what side of the window is the close button on?

615
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Oh my God, I know.

616
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I'm guilty of this.

617
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I used to bitch constantly about the lack of a minimize button,

618
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
and no, I made a big stink about it.

619
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I went on and on and on about it.

620
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
No one cares.

621
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
It was my problem, not yours.

622
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So it's like, why would anyone care?

623
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
But I'm guilty of this as well.

624
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm just as bad as the other guy.

625
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Riley, what are your thoughts on the Unity hate?

626
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Well, here's the thing about Unity too.

627
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,000
There's a large user base who would actually use Unity on other distros if they could.

628
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Sure.

629
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
People would use Unity on Arch if they could,

630
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
but since they can't, they just hate on it.

631
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I actually think Unity is maybe the ultimate example of stuff that we argue about

632
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
that actual users don't care about, because here's the thing.

633
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Even if Unity was, quote, unquote, the most terrible desktop in the history ever,

634
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
it doesn't matter.

635
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
If you are even slightly Linux technically inclined,

636
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
you know how to use a different desktop.

637
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
And if you're a new user to Linux, you really probably have no problem with Unity,

638
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
because truth be told, it's not that bad,

639
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
especially if you don't come in with preconceptions.

640
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
No.

641
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Go ahead.

642
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
It honestly isn't that bad.

643
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
It's a very pretty desktop, especially if you've used it 12.04 forward.

644
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
It's actually halfway stable.

645
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I don't care what you think.

646
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Unless you haven't got to the point where it's valuable.

647
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I think it's something that general users just don't even know they should be caring about.

648
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And Ick, you think somehow maybe user choice plays into all of this?

649
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yes, absolutely.

650
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Here's the thing.

651
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
We keep talking about over and over again,

652
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Linux is about freedom and choice,

653
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and it's something that I wrote actually on the subreddit.

654
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
When it comes to desktop environment,

655
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
use whatever you like the best and works best for you.

656
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Don't let anyone talk you into something else just because they like it more,

657
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
or have some other agenda.

658
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Good advice.

659
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah.

660
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Rodden Corpse, you switched your mom over to a Unity desktop?

661
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I did.

662
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
How'd it go?

663
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
She's been using it for about two years now.

664
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
She likes it, I guess?

665
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Yeah, she has no problem with it.

666
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The thing is I was using it at this time because I was testing it out,

667
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
and I wanted to kind of like have her opinion on it.

668
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And because she's a completely – she doesn't really care at all.

669
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
All of the DEs and stuff like that is irrelevant to her.

670
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
It doesn't matter.

671
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
So when I look at Unity, I find the little flaws and stuff that I don't like,

672
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
and a few things that I do.

673
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Like the dash, I don't like it almost at all.

674
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
But I asked her what she thinks about the dash.

675
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
She's like, what's that?

676
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And I explained it.

677
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
She's like, yeah, I don't care.

678
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Yeah, exactly.

679
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Well, see, I've had – so I had my dad running an older version of Ubuntu with Unity,

680
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
and he really liked it.

681
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
He was coming from – it was either XP or 7.

682
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
It was before Windows 8, and he was switching over,

683
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
and he ran Ubuntu for a little while.

684
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
And what he ran into is kind of what you touch on here, Matt,

685
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
is you say – and sort of closing out your article,

686
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
you say my concern is that newer users who have just come over to the Linux side of the fence

687
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,000
will be scared away by some enthusiasts and their misplaced animosity towards Ubuntu.

688
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Will this color how the majority of newcomers see the Linux community?

689
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
It did for my dad.

690
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Yeah, and I've seen evidence of it.

691
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I don't just – I actually have people that I talk to about this stuff before I write this stuff.

692
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Yeah, he saw – so he had two problems, I think.

693
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
First problem was is he wasn't really clear on where he was supposed to go to look up problems.

694
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
So he wanted to – he moved at one point, and they didn't have internet access.

695
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
They didn't have like cable or DSL where he'd moved to,

696
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
and so he wanted to tether to his phone.

697
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And like trying to look up, and he was at work and trying to do like the Googling at work

698
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and then bring that home, he got so many different results

699
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and so many different mixed messages on that whole thing that it –

700
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
and I don't – I wouldn't blame it all on this,

701
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
but I think it definitely – when it came time to buy a new rig altogether,

702
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
he just kind of decided to go get a Mac.

703
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Yeah, oh, yeah, because it's an all-inclusive experience.

704
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
And as much as I'm not in any way a Mac person, believe me, I really don't like them,

705
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
at the end of the day, they don't sell a computer.

706
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
They sell a collective experience.

707
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Yeah, yeah.

708
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
They really do.

709
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
And, you know, they have the whole genius angle to it, too,

710
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
so he was able to ask the guys some questions.

711
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And I – so this article, you wrote, really resonated with me here

712
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
because not only did I see that through my dad's experience,

713
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
but when we were taking the Arch challenge,

714
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
there was equal parts really good advice that I got from, you know,

715
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
some awesome people on our subreddit and things like that,

716
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
and there was equal parts really like hostile bad advice that I got,

717
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
everything from trying to scare me away from using Arch

718
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and telling me how hard it is to use and how I really have to keep the system maintained,

719
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
and it turns out to be like the easiest Linux box I've ever had to maintain.

720
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
That it would be unstable because you're using bleeding edge.

721
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Yeah, that was another one.

722
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Yep, yep.

723
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And, you know, don't use this tool, use that tool.

724
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
And it's – and I suspect this happened for you, too,

725
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
but it gave me pause for a little bit where I thought,

726
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I don't think I want to deal with this.

727
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Right.

728
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And I don't like this.

729
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
This is – I don't need this.

730
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You know, and it's even more nuanced than it is in Arch

731
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
because in Arch, there's multiple ways to install a piece of software.

732
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Where like in Ubuntu, like pretty much at the end of the day,

733
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
every guide is going to tell you sudo apt-get install, right?

734
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Add this PPA.

735
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Like there's consistencies, so you can get a lot of different –

736
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
you get a lot of different information,

737
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
but they all kind of tell you to use the same tools and do the same things.

738
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Not the same thing in Arch.

739
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Now, thankfully, that Wiki is very authoritative and has a lot of good info,

740
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
but when you're just switching, I felt like I had a lot of mixed messages.

741
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And I can – so I think that experience might be what a lot of new people get

742
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
when like, you know, they're reading a common thread

743
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
and there's just tons of Ubuntu hate in that common thread.

744
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I would agree.

745
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
And what you said about the Wiki,

746
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
the problem with the Wiki is that it's too good.

747
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And what I mean by that is that the information in the Wiki blows other distributions

748
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
out of the water as far as accuracy,

749
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
but the problem is locating and knowing what to search for to find it.

750
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
That's the rub for a lot of people because you don't always know.

751
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Like when I was trying to figure out the whole battery life for, you know,

752
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
the battery life situation for my network,

753
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I wasn't necessarily finding exactly what I was looking for

754
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
until about the third or fourth search and then I clicked.

755
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And the information was fantastic, but it was finding it.

756
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
So I think if they can hone that a little bit, the information is gold.

757
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
There's no problem there.

758
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Some people actually suggest people to look at the Arch Wiki to find the information,

759
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
which is a good idea, but they'll also suggest to people who are not using Arch,

760
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
which is very awkward.

761
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

762
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Ryan, you were going to say it kind of depends on the existence of users of Linux

763
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
to make regular user experiences a little more easier.

764
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Right.

765
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I was basically just going to say that when people talk about moving people to Linux,

766
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
they always think about, you know, telling the advocate why Linux is good

767
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
and why they should use it.

768
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
But they don't necessarily make that transition easy.

769
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Like for example, with my mom or my roommate or my neighbor I've moved over,

770
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I set up their computer.

771
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I find out what they want.

772
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I put the Linux thing that I think fits best for them, the disk drumming,

773
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
and then I put on the different apps that they want.

774
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Like for one of them wanted Wow, so I had to put Wine in, so then I put Wow Connection.

775
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
And if you give them Linux setup where they can have it just the stuff they want to use

776
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
and the things that they would be used to, like the way they get Windows

777
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
when it's already installed, if you do that for them, the transition to Linux

778
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,000
is almost negligible in as far as like whether it's hard or not.

779
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
That's true.

780
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
That's true.

781
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I used to support Linux at a small bookstore in a town north of me,

782
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
and I actually – the service calls were – well, they went from a ton of them to none

783
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
as long as I maintained the machine.

784
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Yeah, I definitely noticed during – I used to joke when my clients would ask me,

785
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
so what should we do here for this desktop?

786
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And I would tell them – I would say thankfully a lot of my clients use Windows.

787
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'm very thankful for that because it gives me ten times the amount of business

788
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
that I would have if they ran Linux.

789
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And that's not just me guessing.

790
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
That's like literally from my experience.

791
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Like I can put Linux in, and once things are set up and stabilized,

792
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
like Rotten Corps is saying, I would go in there,

793
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and I would configure everything for them, right?

794
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And I would even set it up so it would take snapshots of their configuration settings

795
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
and all of that kind of stuff and back those up,

796
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
and we could restore them very simply.

797
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
And Webman was a great tool to help some of their local tech gal set up users

798
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
and stuff like that.

799
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
And that worked so well that I would literally lose money on those clients.

800
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Exactly.

801
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
When I switched to Linux full-time is about the time I got out of repair.

802
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I don't know.

803
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Ick was going to say our problem here is that we've been conditioned by Microsoft.

804
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
What's going on there, Ick?

805
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Well, let me just go ahead and set the way back machine to like 1995

806
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
when Windows 95 first came out.

807
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
People were up in arms that their programs were not right there in front of them

808
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
like they had on the program manager of Windows 3.1.

809
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Now fast forward 19 years later, now everybody is looking for that start menu.

810
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
If they don't see that start menu, they are up in arms.

811
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It's just like, okay, now Microsoft has conditioned us to operate this way.

812
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
And see, that's the thing.

813
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
People are assuming that a desktop environment such as Unity is unintuitive

814
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
just because they're not used to it.

815
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I suppose.

816
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
That's the ding you get.

817
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Give them the ding.

818
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
That man has earned a ding.

819
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
All right.

820
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Well, here you go.

821
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
There you go.

822
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You get a ding.

823
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Are you going to say that maybe we just need to cater to each specific user?

824
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
That's your go, man.

825
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That's your go right there.

826
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
No?

827
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Well, that's what I think he's going to essentially say.

828
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I don't know.

829
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
He has a little bit of lag, by the way.

830
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Oh, okay.

831
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Yeah, it's complicated.

832
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
No, what I was simply going to say is every user has their own sensibility

833
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
of how a desktop should and should not be.

834
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I mean, you have people who use Windows 8 perfectly with and without touch.

835
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And you have people who see the Macintosh interface

836
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
and see that's the perfect desktop.

837
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
They can't use anything else regardless of, you know, whatever it is.

838
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
So every user has their own sensibility of what a desktop should be

839
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and what their workflow should be.

840
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
So while we're arguing about what the perfect one is,

841
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
we're thinking of a hypothetical magical user that doesn't really exist.

842
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
That's true.

843
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Exactly.

844
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
That's very true.

845
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Exactly.

846
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
That's what I'm kind of driving at is that intuitiveness is subjective.

847
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Yeah.

848
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
True.

849
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
So this goes going back to Apple is the big threat here.

850
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I think the thing about Mac OS that you've got to wrap your head around

851
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
is that it's not a great desktop in a lot of ways.

852
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Like when I use it for, you know, I have several machines here in the studio.

853
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
And, you know, to me it feels very old.

854
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It feels like I can, you know, I remember the Macs from the 80s

855
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
and I still see a lot of influence there.

856
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
And I don't think it's that amazing of a desktop.

857
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I think it's what Matt's saying is that with Apple it's this hardware,

858
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,000
good enough software, better than the alternative, which is Windows,

859
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
and that support package.

860
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And I think when you're somebody like Will Wheaton and that price isn't a factor,

861
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
because that's I'd say the number one argument,

862
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
once you take out all the freedom and the open arguments,

863
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
which if you don't even know to be concerned about that,

864
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
that's not even part of the equation, right?

865
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
If you take away that and you take away the cost barrier,

866
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,000
because for a huge segment of people that's not going to be an issue,

867
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I think Apple is a fierce competitor to Linux.

868
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I think it's much more of a threat on the desktop than Windows is.

869
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Well, it is, especially for someone coming from Linux,

870
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
because they can drop down to a command line and do anything they need to do.

871
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I mean, that's the other thing.

872
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Like look at Miguel Ytikaza, you know, one of the original GNOME developers

873
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
who eventually just threw his arms up in the air and said,

874
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
you know what, I'm going to go get a MacBook.

875
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
But you could sort of get that equivalent on Linux easily

876
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
if you go with something like Ubuntu and System76.

877
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I mean, they have excellent customer support,

878
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,000
magnificent hardware on top of generally they ship on what like LTSs.

879
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I think this is an important piece.

880
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
This is why I'm a System76 fan,

881
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
is because they are also creating that entire end-to-end experience.

882
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
But the problem is we don't have enough people doing that,

883
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,000
whereas Apple has this massively established presence and brand.

884
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And we do our part just to spread the word about System76,

885
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
because I think it's really important.

886
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I think that whole entire product package is super important.

887
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And I think one way we can achieve that today is in larger installations,

888
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
like at schools and at businesses where you have a person that comes in

889
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
and rolls out a system for a whole bunch of people.

890
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
That seems so ripe for the Linux desktop picking to me.

891
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It's ridiculous.

892
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,000
It's just maybe a few software applications, but that just seems so ripe.

893
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Whereas that home user who's a 30-something hipster

894
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
that just wants to go down to the mall and buy a metal MacBook,

895
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I don't know if we're going to be able to get that person.

896
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
But I think schools and businesses,

897
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
and any time where you can take the experience

898
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
and you can build it around the need,

899
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I think Linux is such a slam dunk for that.

900
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Well, that's sort of already happening now.

901
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
We see Chromebooks and Chrome OS,

902
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,000
which is technically Linux-based in educational areas all the time now.

903
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
It's becoming increasingly popular.

904
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
That just makes me sad.

905
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So I think the formula to making this work

906
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
is the fact that it takes a multinational company to make this happen.

907
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Right.

908
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:45,000
It boils down to the same thing that Matt has said a bunch of times,

909
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
and that is marketing.

910
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Yeah.

911
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Mac stuff, the software, is okay,

912
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
and it's built on stuff that was already good in the first place.

913
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
So if you took LXDE, put a dock on it, it's very close to the way Mac works.

914
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Or like GNOME 3, or if you spend a couple of hours configuring KDE, right?

915
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Yeah.

916
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I really believe you can have a more modern,

917
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
experienced desktop that has better efficiencies.

918
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
In some ways, especially I think for GNOME 3, it can be more user-friendly.

919
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I agree.

920
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
This is such a problem that I just kind of want to –

921
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
and I guess I want to bring this back to how the community can make a difference here.

922
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
We're not going to convince everybody to lay down arms

923
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
and embrace each other in a kumbaya, but –

924
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I have an idea.

925
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
What if the GNU project –

926
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
because they always want Linux to be called GNU-slash-Linux –

927
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,000
they put up money for marketing to make it GNU-slash-Linux?

928
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I don't know. I think it's close. I think it's close.

929
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Get a GNU start with GNU-slash-Linux.

930
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Well, here's an actionable formula of how this could actually be done.

931
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
First of all, you get yourself a Kickstarter project,

932
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
or however you want to fund it,

933
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
which is sort of a collective funding process that gets a bunch of advertising dollars together.

934
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Then everybody in key metro cities goes to the Google AdWords program

935
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
that allows you to advertise on your local cable channels.

936
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Take a Fiverr voiceover of one of those really good movie voices.

937
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Slap together some great video capture from OpenShot or whatever.

938
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Just really show off what the desktop can do.

939
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Make it sound like a movie intro.

940
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Launch those in each one of those metro areas on television.

941
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Stop this internet crap.

942
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Watch TV where regular people actually get their media, and watch what happens.

943
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
I think you might just run viruses.

944
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Isn't this part of the problem, though, is there's no Linux Inc.?

945
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:47,000
There's no company that needs to capitalize on this opportunity, that could capitalize.

946
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
There's individual companies that are all kind of scattered about,

947
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,000
and I think that's one of the reasons Ubuntu has such name recognition

948
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
is because there's a company behind that,

949
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
and Red Hat has such name recognition and brand recognition.

950
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
But there's no one company who's got the money and the presence to do that.

951
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
So maybe, let me shift the conversation here.

952
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Is this why everybody is so hard over mobile?

953
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Because it's the grand reset of this technical century that we get to start all over again,

954
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,000
and everybody is afresh and new, and the possibilities are endless.

955
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Is that why everybody's so hot on mobile?

956
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Maybe it's because they have, right now, essentially two platforms that they have to look at only,

957
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and they're so massively widespread now.

958
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Since it's easy for people who are not computer users,

959
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
even just regular people who just want a tablet so they can watch something like Netflix or something,

960
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
it can bring so many more people to look at your stuff,

961
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,000
so people are just kind of jumping on the bandwagon of any kind of mobile device of all.

962
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,000
It's a lot easier to get mobile devices in the hands of individuals around the world,

963
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
and the fact that there's billions of individuals around the world that still don't have a mobile device,

964
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,000
that's a huge user base that a company could target.

965
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Well, like Dave is saying in the chat room, everybody loves a computer in their pocket,

966
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
but Wimpy, what kind of tipping point do you think we're at?

967
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
You say we're at a tipping point right now?

968
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Well, 20 years ago, Apple was in the shitter, and they've really turned their fortunes around.

969
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:36,000
The two companies that are really driving popularization of cutting-edge technology at the moment are Apple and Google.

970
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I think the tipping point that we're at right now is that Microsoft is on a downward trend.

971
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:49,000
They're hanging on to traditional markets and really not succeeding in that,

972
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
and I think the tipping point we're at is with Apple and iOS and Mac OS X,

973
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
and then Google with obviously Android and then Chrome OS,

974
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,000
and I think it will be a battle that's fought out between Mac OS and Linux in the guise of Chrome OS.

975
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Well, I think the big problem with Windows is it's sort of become a tainted name.

976
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I know people who won't buy Windows phones because they think they'll get viruses.

977
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
It's a black mark. I agree. I think the Windows name is now a black mark on a product,

978
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
and I think the general consumer thinks it's something old, and it's not hip. It's not cool anymore.

979
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I think that's what's holding back a lot of these Windows mobile devices and desktops.

980
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Well, I feel sorry for Microsoft because they can't win. They try and be hip, and then everyone says,

981
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
oh, we don't know how to use Metro, and then they try and be like old school and everyone has a go at them

982
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
for not being different. It is kind of bad for them.

983
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
They're trying to be hip again.

984
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,000
They're just trying to do it through a bunch of people dancing around holding tablets, and that just doesn't work.

985
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Clicking them together.

986
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Exactly. I'm always running around my office smacking the monitors together to try and get it to accomplish tasks.

987
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Really?

988
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:11,000
That's an interesting concept. The whole idea, is it going to be Macbooks versus Chromebooks in the future?

989
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:17,000
You'll have everybody who wants to save a buck running Chromebooks, but they'll be inextricably forever linked

990
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:24,000
at the hip to Google, and you'll have everybody that wants to drop some cash, we're talking large percentages here,

991
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:31,000
buying Macbooks, and is Linux going to be, is the predominance of Linux going to be this bastardized, closed down,

992
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
souped up for their commercial cloud services client side OS?

993
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Wait, wait, wait. You said commercial software.

994
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Would that honestly be so bad? I mean, this is open source.

995
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
People can do whatever with it that they choose, and people can implement it the way they want.

996
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,000
And if Linux adoption requires that companies like Google and whoever change it the way they need to,

997
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:06,000
or the tableization of Linux, would that be so bad? Because isn't that sort of the original idea?

998
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

999
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:17,000
I don't know. It's not what I hope for. And I think also, we can't really have this conversation without keeping in mind

1000
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
that Linux will dominate on the server side too, and that's going to be all different kinds of operating systems.

1001
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
But it does make you wonder what the future holds for these desktop-focused distros,

1002
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
and if eventually they're not just going to be kind of, you know, just...

1003
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Outdated.

1004
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Yeah, the ones that survive will be the ones that are maintained by community enthusiasts.

1005
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
I've noticed myself, especially, and I don't know if it's just the point of my life I'm at,

1006
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
but I see my parents and my grandparents and all these other people around me going and saying,

1007
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I don't know what to do anymore. They've always had, you know, go with Windows if you want business,

1008
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
or go with Mac if you want media. And now they don't know where to go.

1009
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And it's kind of this weird point where people that once thought they knew what they had to do

1010
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
don't know anything anymore. It's kind of sad.

1011
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
We're in a weird transition, and I think what we're trying to wrap our brains around on this show is,

1012
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:19,000
what do we need to change to get Linux in position to sort of be there to catch a certain amount of people

1013
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
who are dropping away from Windows, and are there things just as a community we could do?

1014
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And I think we've identified guides, you know, informing people,

1015
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
and one of the things that I want to accomplish with How To Linux once we launch it is,

1016
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I think the easy wins are the enthusiasts, the technically inclined people,

1017
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
the folks who want to solve a particular problem with Linux,

1018
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
and my hope with How To Linux is that we can provide an on-ramp where we're going to say,

1019
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
here's your problem, here's how you solve that problem with Linux,

1020
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
and that hopefully will be an on-ramp there, and then maybe as people play with it, they'll be like,

1021
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
hey, you know, I could load this on my laptop. I could try it out on my lap.

1022
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
You know, that's what I'm hoping we can do as a network to help Linux,

1023
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
but I wonder as a whole wide community, can we just dial it?

1024
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Is it possible to dial it down a notch, turn down the hater aid, the system D debates are done,

1025
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,000
the mirror debate seems like it's pretty much where it's going to be at.

1026
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Monkey suits will be worn.

1027
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Can't we all just use this as an opportunity to kind of take a snapshot of where we're at and say,

1028
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
you know, let's just dial it down a little bit and just welcome everybody in.

1029
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
How do we do that? Is that possible?

1030
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Well, Chris, you were saying with the How To Linux, and I really appreciate the work you do,

1031
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
because that's how your videos is what really got me into Linux,

1032
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:52,000
but I think the key really is shorter videos, because I remember I might only want to watch the

1033
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:59,000
max, you know, how to section and I'd have to, you know, watch all episode. It'd be nice if we just had like

1034
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
lots of little really informative videos.

1035
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Right. Shot of information.

1036
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Yeah, because most of the question I get brought uploads is, oh, I've downloaded this tar.gz file.

1037
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Now what? You know, that's like the biggest question I get.

1038
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Yeah.

1039
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
But that only takes maybe three minutes to explain.

1040
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
We're working on it right now.

1041
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
I'm happy to announce that Ik in the Mumble Room here and Crash Bandicoot will be joining us.

1042
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Ik will be our lead producer and Crash will be our associate producer on Linux, on How To Linux,

1043
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
and we've got a bunch of really great applications.

1044
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
We're going to continue to go through those.

1045
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I think we'll probably develop a bench of producers who can be working on content,

1046
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,000
so that way they can work at their own pace, at their own speed on the things that scratch their particular itch,

1047
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
and we can have several people working.

1048
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And if How To Linux takes off, if it's a hit, I want to be able to scale that show up big,

1049
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
maybe multiple times a week, all kinds of topics, guides, written tutorials, all that kind of stuff,

1050
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
where it's all still early planning stages.

1051
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
We're not ready to pull the trigger on any one particular thing,

1052
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
but we're assembling our team right now.

1053
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
We're getting things ready in place.

1054
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:14,000
And I feel like even if moving forward we only capture just the technically inclined,

1055
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
the Windows power users and the sysadmins who've ran Linux for years,

1056
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
but now are thinking about switching on their desktops,

1057
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:27,000
I think that's a great percentage, that's a big percentage of users that we could bring over to Linux.

1058
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,000
So I'm excited about that.

1059
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Now before we wrap up this week's episode, coming up on Sunday's Linux Action Show,

1060
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
we're doing a review of the SolidXK desktop.

1061
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Now you can go over to SolidXK.com, that's S-O-L-Y-D-X-K.com, and download this.

1062
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
We're going to do the home edition, Matt, okay?

1063
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So we're going to grab the home edition because that's like our latest and greatest.

1064
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,000
This is a Debian-based semi-rolling release that uses the XFCE desktop,

1065
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
and we want to do something kind of new this week.

1066
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
We want to get your review of it.

1067
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So try it out, and between now and during the last live show,

1068
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
send us your review on Twitter and use the hashtag action review

1069
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
to tweet your thoughts about the SolidXK desktop right now,

1070
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
between now and during the last live show,

1071
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
and in the feedback segment, Matt and I will pull up all those hashtag action review tweets

1072
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
and read your mini reviews there at the end of the show,

1073
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
so you have a chance to get your thoughts in.

1074
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And if everything goes as planned, Matt, the SolidXK developers will be joining us

1075
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
on next week's Linux Unplugged.

1076
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Sounds good.

1077
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Yeah, so load up your testing box, Matt, and we'll give SolidXK a spin on Sunday.

1078
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I'll see you then, okay?

1079
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
See you then. Bye-bye.

1080
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
All right, everyone.
