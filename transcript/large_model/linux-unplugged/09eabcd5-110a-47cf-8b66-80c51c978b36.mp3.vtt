WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.660
It's been a little bit since we've given Vim love, but now we have two excuses.

00:06.660 --> 00:09.960
First one being, you can now play Mario on Vim.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.140
It's a Vim plugin.

00:11.140 --> 00:12.440
How about that, right?

00:12.440 --> 00:13.440
It's so great.

00:13.440 --> 00:14.680
It's, it's so great.

00:14.680 --> 00:18.840
It's a little rough, but it is definitely, no doubt about it, Mario and there's Goombas

00:18.840 --> 00:23.480
in there and you're jumping on them and I mean, why not?

00:23.480 --> 00:29.000
The real game is an excuse to talk about Vim today, which this week turned 29 years young.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
How about that?

00:30.000 --> 00:31.560
Almost 30 years of Vim.

00:31.560 --> 00:32.560
Happy birthday.

00:32.560 --> 00:33.560
And you know what?

00:33.560 --> 00:34.840
They're still going strong.

00:34.840 --> 00:38.360
The birthday announcement has a lot of good news about where Vim is going, what's happening,

00:38.360 --> 00:42.460
including a whole bunch of improvements to testing, reliability, and just nice features.

00:42.460 --> 00:43.860
Happy birthday, Vim.

00:43.860 --> 00:46.880
We talk a lot about Nano, the world's best editor.

00:46.880 --> 00:50.240
You know, I shoot down every time I try to add a story to the doc.

00:50.240 --> 00:51.240
Slipped one in today though.

00:51.240 --> 00:52.240
I mean, it is the birthday.

00:52.240 --> 01:03.840
Hello friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

01:03.840 --> 01:04.840
My name is Chris.

01:04.840 --> 01:05.840
My name is Wes.

01:05.840 --> 01:06.840
Hello, Wes.

01:06.840 --> 01:12.160
Episode 378 of your Linux talk show is brought to you by a cloud guru, the leader in hands

01:12.160 --> 01:16.800
on learning in the cloud for Linux and modern tech skills, hundreds of courses, thousands

01:16.800 --> 01:17.800
of hands on labs.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.840
Get certified, get started, get hired.

01:19.840 --> 01:22.120
Go to a cloud guru.com.

01:22.120 --> 01:24.560
Wes we have a lot to get into today.

01:24.560 --> 01:31.020
It appears that there may be a whole new way to build and distribute applications on Linux

01:31.020 --> 01:32.880
and it's not electron, Wes.

01:32.880 --> 01:33.880
What?

01:33.880 --> 01:34.880
That's right.

01:34.880 --> 01:35.940
They're native applications.

01:35.940 --> 01:42.820
And for so many years we have heard the promise of write once, run everywhere.

01:42.820 --> 01:47.560
But it may be that the stars have aligned and just that has actually happened.

01:47.560 --> 01:52.400
I'm talking native applications for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android from one tool.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.400
That's everywhere.

01:53.400 --> 01:56.360
I'll tell you about it more in a little bit, but of course we've also got a bunch of community

01:56.360 --> 01:57.360
news to get into.

01:57.360 --> 02:00.480
And I mean, we have some big batch.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.660
This is way too much.

02:01.660 --> 02:02.660
We should have trimmed this a little bit.

02:02.660 --> 02:05.080
It's an irresponsible show, but nevertheless, we persist.

02:05.080 --> 02:06.520
Little batch maintenance is all I'm saying, Wes.

02:06.520 --> 02:07.520
It's all I'm saying.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.000
Time appropriate greetings, mobile room.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Hello.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Time appropriate greetings.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Hello.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Hello.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Hello.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
It's still the election.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah, it is election day.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Hello, virtual lug.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.720
Good to have you because we do have some big news to get into today, an untrimmed batch

02:21.720 --> 02:23.240
as it were.

02:23.240 --> 02:29.360
And we start with news about the Raspberry Pi and a new version of it, a new faster version

02:29.360 --> 02:31.760
of it that is built into a keyboard.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.880
It's called the Raspberry Pi 400.

02:34.880 --> 02:43.020
It is a $70 Linux box that harkens back to the days of my childhood where I had a computer

02:43.020 --> 02:44.080
that was built into the keyboard.

02:44.080 --> 02:48.520
It was much bigger than this that you could hook directly up to the television.

02:48.520 --> 02:51.920
Inside the Raspberry Pi keyboard, which is a product that has been shipping for a while,

02:51.920 --> 02:54.800
so if you've seen that, you know what this thing looks like.

02:54.800 --> 02:59.520
Inside that now, and in a slightly larger version, they have built a full-fledged Pi

02:59.520 --> 03:03.000
computer in that plastic keyboard.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.080
Oh, yeah.

03:04.080 --> 03:10.440
At the heart of the Raspberry Pi 400 is a 1.8 gigahertz ARM Cortex A72.

03:10.440 --> 03:15.080
This quad-core chip is similar to last year's Raspberry Pi 4 that you know and love so well,

03:15.080 --> 03:18.080
Chris, but it is clocked to run slightly faster.

03:18.080 --> 03:26.560
It has a slightly revved version of the Raspberry Pi 4 CPU chip, and that's interesting to note.

03:26.560 --> 03:30.320
Although it's only four gigabytes of RAM, they didn't go to the full eight gigabytes.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.640
Yeah, I would have liked to have seen that.

03:32.640 --> 03:36.480
There's also two micro HDMI ports, so you could actually connect this to two monitors

03:36.480 --> 03:39.840
at once, each up to 4K at a time.

03:39.840 --> 03:40.880
That's nuts.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.960
And it's not like they just put a Pi in this thing.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.640
Yeah, I mean, anyone could do that.

03:44.640 --> 03:50.440
We'll link you to a blog that did a teardown, but the Pi 400 is using a custom mainboard

03:50.440 --> 03:55.520
that is a form factor we've never seen for the Raspberry Pi before that sort of fills

03:55.520 --> 03:57.260
out the back end of this keyboard.

03:57.260 --> 04:01.400
There's also a bit of thermal work that's been done in there.

04:01.400 --> 04:06.080
It looks almost like just a regular Raspberry Pi keyboard until you look at the back of

04:06.080 --> 04:11.840
it and you will see there's still GPIO pins there, which I think is really interesting.

04:11.840 --> 04:15.800
You see the USB, you see Ethernet, you see the micro SD card slot.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.620
It looks like it's going to be pretty easy to get access to that thing, too.

04:18.620 --> 04:21.840
If you want to build something, you just probably will need an adapter that can connect right

04:21.840 --> 04:23.680
into that space for the GPIO pins.

04:23.680 --> 04:27.760
Yeah, you know, I like that because the Pi has always been this sort of, you know, craft

04:27.760 --> 04:31.440
enabling project just because it's crammed into a keyboard here doesn't mean you no longer

04:31.440 --> 04:32.440
have that.

04:32.440 --> 04:37.600
I think this is a good quote by their founder, Eben Upton, Raspberry Pi has always been a

04:37.600 --> 04:41.720
PC company inspired by the home computers of the 1980s.

04:41.720 --> 04:46.840
Our mission is to put affordable, high performance, programmable computers into the hands of people

04:46.840 --> 04:47.840
all over the world.

04:47.840 --> 04:55.440
A couple of interesting things of note here, I think the name Pi 400 tells us that there

04:55.440 --> 04:59.840
will likely be a Pi 500 and a Pi 600 when there's a Pi 5 and a Pi 6.

04:59.840 --> 05:00.840
That's a natural evolution.

05:00.840 --> 05:01.840
Right.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.120
It's not really delayed from the main board.

05:03.120 --> 05:07.940
Like we see, we almost see a bit of a potential release cadence coming up here.

05:07.940 --> 05:13.080
First you release the main Raspberry Pi, so the Raspberry Pi 5, then six to nine months

05:13.080 --> 05:18.300
after that, you release the compute board and maybe you don't do this for every Pi model,

05:18.300 --> 05:19.300
but you know, I don't know.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.300
Pick standout ones.

05:20.300 --> 05:21.300
Right.

05:21.300 --> 05:23.720
And then a few months after that, the all in one.

05:23.720 --> 05:26.480
The other thing that this strikes me here is this is just the keyboard.

05:26.480 --> 05:29.440
It ships, you can get it with a kit for a hundred dollars that comes with a mouse and

05:29.440 --> 05:34.520
a guy and a pre flashed Raspberry Pi OS.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.240
So basically everything that you need right there.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.000
And I did actually pre-order the kit.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
What?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.600
It might be, I think make for a really great Christmas gift.

05:41.600 --> 05:45.880
I haven't picked who yet, but maybe it's me.

05:45.880 --> 05:49.560
Worst case, you just always got like an extra little computer ready to go laying around.

05:49.560 --> 05:50.560
Yeah.

05:50.560 --> 05:54.120
Like, you know what's funny about this is often one of the things that, and you know

05:54.120 --> 05:57.600
this is true, one of the things we're looking around the studio for is a keyboard.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.600
No kidding.

05:58.600 --> 06:03.120
I think we've had to resort to hooking up like an unused Mac keyboard on the server

06:03.120 --> 06:04.920
in this, in the, in the disgraceful.

06:04.920 --> 06:05.920
It is.

06:05.920 --> 06:06.920
Yeah.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.080
So there is that advantage to it, but not everybody is like me where they have more

06:10.080 --> 06:11.800
monitors than keyboards.

06:11.800 --> 06:17.040
And so it makes me wonder if we won't see a future all in one kind of like an iMac,

06:17.040 --> 06:18.200
but instead it's a Raspberry Pi.

06:18.200 --> 06:22.000
I'll be just powering the whole thing and well, and when you get the kit, maybe it comes

06:22.000 --> 06:25.940
with the Raspberry Pi keyboard that looks like this, but without the computer in it.

06:25.940 --> 06:29.480
I would like to see something like that because that would actually make a more compelling

06:29.480 --> 06:30.480
gift for my kids.

06:30.480 --> 06:31.480
Yeah.

06:31.480 --> 06:32.480
And it's simple.

06:32.480 --> 06:33.480
You don't have to think about it.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.960
There's no other matching or figuring out, you don't know what kind of monitor you need

06:34.960 --> 06:35.960
or how to hook it up.

06:35.960 --> 06:36.960
Right.

06:36.960 --> 06:37.960
Not a problem.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.760
Maybe that'll be the Pi 800 with eight gigs of RAM.

06:39.760 --> 06:40.760
Right.

06:40.760 --> 06:41.760
You're going to pre-order that next.

06:41.760 --> 06:42.760
Yeah.

06:42.760 --> 06:48.560
I just want something nice, like a 1080p decent size screen, you know, putting like a 20 inch

06:48.560 --> 06:49.560
monitor, 21 inch monitor.

06:49.560 --> 06:50.560
That'd be just right.

06:50.560 --> 06:52.960
I wonder if they're not going this direction.

06:52.960 --> 06:58.440
We recently talked on Linux Action News about, and we talked about on this show too, about

06:58.440 --> 07:05.320
Ubuntu 2010 focusing their desktop support, the full fledged GNOME Shell desktop version

07:05.320 --> 07:06.880
of Ubuntu on the Raspberry Pi 4.

07:06.880 --> 07:07.880
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.800
Well, guess what now just works out of the box?

07:09.800 --> 07:10.800
Right here.

07:10.800 --> 07:11.800
It's a natural choice.

07:11.800 --> 07:12.800
Yeah.

07:12.800 --> 07:18.200
I think Canonical has an idea of where the Raspberry Pi Foundation is taking this.

07:18.200 --> 07:23.400
And I think that was part of why with 2004, they got base server support working.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.520
And I can testify that it works well.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.360
I have it running on like four Raspberry Pis.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.320
And then with 2010, they got the desktop side.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.520
And we looked at them and we said, well, this doesn't make a lot of sense.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.840
It seems a little slow.

07:33.840 --> 07:37.040
It seems like a lot when you could just run MATE or XFCE.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.040
Right.

07:38.040 --> 07:42.080
But when you start to see this strategy emerge, and this thing's a little bit faster.

07:42.080 --> 07:45.000
It's going to get faster because it's probably going to keep going.

07:45.000 --> 07:50.020
When the next Ubuntu LTS comes around, something tells me there'll be a Raspberry Pi device

07:50.020 --> 07:51.600
that runs it just fine.

07:51.600 --> 07:56.160
And Canonical will have been there for years in these interim releases, getting that support

07:56.160 --> 07:57.160
nailed down.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.720
It'll be a standard platform by then.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.720
Yeah.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.480
And it's a safe bet that there's going to be more devices like this.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.560
They're not slowing down.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.360
And I think it's going to sell well.

08:06.360 --> 08:10.480
It was one of those news announcements where I got a lot of people that said, hey, did

08:10.480 --> 08:11.480
you see this?

08:11.480 --> 08:17.520
And of course, because of the time zone differences, it came out during our nighttime, although

08:17.520 --> 08:19.880
I wasn't able to sleep that night.

08:19.880 --> 08:21.760
So I actually jumped on the pre-order right away.

08:21.760 --> 08:22.760
I was up and-

08:22.760 --> 08:23.760
You are a news hound.

08:23.760 --> 08:24.760
I was.

08:24.760 --> 08:25.760
I got on it.

08:25.760 --> 08:30.460
And then when I went to bed and I got like a solid hour, 45 minutes of sleep, I woke

08:30.460 --> 08:34.300
up to just tons of messages from people on the east side that had woken up and seen the

08:34.300 --> 08:35.640
news and wanted to make sure-

08:35.640 --> 08:36.640
Chris, have you heard?

08:36.640 --> 08:37.640
Which I appreciate.

08:37.640 --> 08:38.640
I think that's great.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.920
If that breaks, it gives me an idea of the interest in the audience when I hear from

08:41.920 --> 08:43.640
a bunch of people tell me about it.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.360
And I also am excited about it.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.000
So I jumped on it.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.320
And I'll give you a full review.

08:48.320 --> 08:53.960
I paid for it with my own hard earned money because I don't want to, you know, I don't

08:53.960 --> 08:54.960
need a review.

08:54.960 --> 08:55.960
You don't want to own it.

08:55.960 --> 08:56.960
And I want to give you a full review.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.980
And so whoever gets it's going to get it with the box already being opened once.

08:59.980 --> 09:02.800
But that's the price they have to pay, Wes.

09:02.800 --> 09:06.500
We have some links to the Teardown, which is really interesting.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.240
It's a much wider board.

09:08.240 --> 09:14.320
It runs about 65, 70 percent the length of the keyboard, where a traditional Pi would

09:14.320 --> 09:16.400
just take up a small portion of that.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.180
Sort of squashed and stretched it out.

09:18.180 --> 09:22.760
The technical difference between the Raspberry Pi 4 that you probably already own or have

09:22.760 --> 09:29.280
already heard about and the version that's shipping today in the Pi 400 is just essentially

09:29.280 --> 09:36.040
a rev on the chip and it's obvious in this Teardown that the model is just changed by

09:36.040 --> 09:44.560
a couple of numbers and it is capable of essentially hitting better performance at better thermals.

09:44.560 --> 09:49.440
And it appears to have a few software level bug fixes that the already shipped version

09:49.440 --> 09:55.360
that's also on the Raspberry Pi Compute have, but are obviously not super issues.

09:55.360 --> 09:58.720
But you know, you get some things in production, you make some tidies, you make a revision

09:58.720 --> 10:01.800
on the chip, you get better thermals, you have less bugs and slightly better performance.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.680
And that all kind of came together here.

10:03.680 --> 10:07.120
There's more information in the show notes, but nice to see it.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.120
I would love eight gigs.

10:08.120 --> 10:11.200
Yeah, that would be that would be a big one because at that level, I feel like I'd be

10:11.200 --> 10:14.080
I feel pretty comfortable, especially just as another computer.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.360
Maybe it's attached to a TV somewhere in my home or just laying around if I need a backup

10:17.360 --> 10:18.480
or I have a guest.

10:18.480 --> 10:23.360
It also clearly, clearly signals that they are interested in people using the Pi as a

10:23.360 --> 10:24.360
desktop.

10:24.360 --> 10:27.360
Well, we've kind of been debating over the years, like when is it going to get there

10:27.360 --> 10:31.160
to really make sense, at least not in a I can only afford a Pi, but if you know, when

10:31.160 --> 10:32.160
is it just usable?

10:32.160 --> 10:34.320
Yeah, when is it no longer a compromise?

10:34.320 --> 10:36.160
And it's just like, why would you pay for anything more?

10:36.160 --> 10:42.100
And when you start to get it out like this, as a bundle for $100, there's a lot of family

10:42.100 --> 10:46.600
members that just need email, they want access to a few websites, that would really work

10:46.600 --> 10:47.600
for them.

10:47.600 --> 10:53.520
I personally feel like the performance isn't there, I think, to the degree that they seem

10:53.520 --> 10:55.160
to be signaling.

10:55.160 --> 10:59.720
But if they're building these units, they're clearly interested in that they have the Raspberry

10:59.720 --> 11:05.360
Pi OS where they can continue to build and evolve a lower resources desktop that performs

11:05.360 --> 11:06.360
well.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.040
So we'll see more, I think.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.040
It's really interesting.

11:09.040 --> 11:14.480
I myself would buy one of these and probably throw Manjaro or Ubuntu on there myself, with

11:14.480 --> 11:18.760
probably a lead towards Manjaro just because the improvements are going to come in quicker

11:18.760 --> 11:19.760
from upstream.

11:19.760 --> 11:20.760
You love that Roland.

11:20.760 --> 11:21.760
I do.

11:21.760 --> 11:26.760
Speaking of Manjaro, Phil from Manjaro joins us to give us a couple of updates on things

11:26.760 --> 11:29.720
including an upcoming Nibia release.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.520
So what is the details here?

11:31.520 --> 11:32.520
Welcome, Phil.

11:32.520 --> 11:33.520
Hello, hello.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.520
Great to be back.

11:34.520 --> 11:41.920
So yes, also I got on the Raspberry Pi train and have also ordered two of the 400s.

11:41.920 --> 11:45.240
And yes, we know about Ubuntu, that it's not as best.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.960
So we try to get it faster.

11:47.960 --> 11:54.760
We will try it with KDE as we did that with PiBook Pro already.

11:54.760 --> 11:59.920
And maybe we go also even crazier and try Deepin, because that is the real new thing.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.640
I don't know how it works, but maybe I will try that out.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.600
I've had a fascination with Deepin.

12:04.600 --> 12:09.000
It's come up a lot between Wes and I off air recently about talking more or trying it more,

12:09.000 --> 12:10.620
but I just haven't gotten around to it.

12:10.620 --> 12:16.440
But I do like the idea of Plasma too, because in my opinion, it scales surprisingly well

12:16.440 --> 12:17.600
to a range of hardware.

12:17.600 --> 12:21.000
You would think it only works on high end stuff, but surprisingly, they've put a lot

12:21.000 --> 12:24.520
of work into making Kaywin work pretty efficiently on lower powered hardware.

12:24.520 --> 12:25.520
Thank you.

12:25.520 --> 12:26.520
I'll keep an eye out for that.

12:26.520 --> 12:28.320
But that's not Nibia.

12:28.320 --> 12:29.320
What is Nibia?

12:29.320 --> 12:36.520
Well, Nibia is the new release we're planning, it's 20.2, which is the successor of Mika.

12:36.520 --> 12:45.400
We will update the kernel to 5.9, have the latest Plasma on it, this would be the 5.20.3

12:45.400 --> 12:46.400
when it's out.

12:46.400 --> 12:51.160
And of course, we have done a lot of work in the GNOME section.

12:51.160 --> 12:59.280
So we will have maybe Blymos working again and some setup like OEM, so the user can simply

12:59.280 --> 13:03.760
choose to configure it on the PC when he gets it.

13:03.760 --> 13:09.920
So if you have some old people or friend and you want to install a Manjaro on it, you can

13:09.920 --> 13:14.840
simply partition everything, get everything ready and then give him the complete computer

13:14.840 --> 13:18.720
and he can set up his user and own settings by his own.

13:18.720 --> 13:23.720
So maybe this will boost up also the usage of the GNOME edition.

13:23.720 --> 13:30.440
And maybe if that is good, then we might extend it to other editions like XFC and KDE as well.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.480
That's great to hear.

13:32.480 --> 13:36.160
Over the last few weeks, I've kind of been making a transition back to GNOME Shell.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.640
And so that's really good to hear that.

13:37.640 --> 13:41.480
Now you said something there I got to ask you about, because we've been trying to figure

13:41.480 --> 13:47.800
out what is going on with kernel 5.9 and NVIDIA driver support, because I've seen there's

13:47.800 --> 13:53.160
an NVIDIA driver update, but it's not clear if they've solved the 5.9 GPL condom issue

13:53.160 --> 13:54.160
or not.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.160
It sounds like you're shipping 5.9.

13:55.160 --> 13:56.480
So you've probably been looking at this.

13:56.480 --> 14:00.940
Well, we will ship it and we already tested the community gave us feedback.

14:00.940 --> 14:02.640
So CUDA is working again.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.600
You can use Blender again and also Darktable.

14:05.600 --> 14:06.800
So it seems to fix it.

14:06.800 --> 14:10.320
But I wonder myself as well, because they didn't announce it that it's fixed.

14:10.320 --> 14:15.980
So I only see the last message like mid November, you will have a fixed version.

14:15.980 --> 14:19.000
So it seems they made it already early November.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.120
So good for them, but communication is a little bit broken, it seems.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.700
Yeah, that's interesting that they wouldn't have made an announcement about it.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.840
But it there was the update and CUDA does seem to be working with 5.9, which was the

14:31.840 --> 14:33.840
key problem.

14:33.840 --> 14:37.440
And it would appear they really turned that around.

14:37.440 --> 14:39.620
I mean, I guess they had a heads up about this whole thing.

14:39.620 --> 14:45.860
But I guess I go back to the old days of Linux when a younger Chris was running Linux and

14:45.860 --> 14:51.960
I could see myself waiting around six, seven months before a vendor would get off their

14:51.960 --> 14:54.420
duff and fix something.

14:54.420 --> 15:00.520
And here it almost seems like Nvidia not only got it out relatively fast for a large company,

15:00.520 --> 15:03.640
but they are almost, they're almost like not addressing it.

15:03.640 --> 15:05.740
Like they don't even want to talk about the fact that it was an issue.

15:05.740 --> 15:07.340
They don't want there to be any concern.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.040
They don't want anybody to worry about it.

15:09.040 --> 15:13.500
Yeah, the community taught them otherwise and they had to react.

15:13.500 --> 15:17.780
So there was even two announcements, one in the graphics section and one is the customer

15:17.780 --> 15:22.280
section that 5.9 was not working after the community spoke up.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.620
So I don't know what it is.

15:23.620 --> 15:26.940
Yeah, they made a big, they did make it clear it wouldn't work, but now they haven't made

15:26.940 --> 15:31.220
it clear that it would work and maybe something's forthcoming still, but, or maybe they just

15:31.220 --> 15:33.660
don't want to raise a lot of attention to it.

15:33.660 --> 15:38.900
Well, I will keep my eye out for Nibia, especially for the GNOME Shell version.

15:38.900 --> 15:39.900
That sounds pretty good.

15:39.900 --> 15:43.700
I've seen people showing pictures of their Manjaro edition pine phones arriving.

15:43.700 --> 15:44.700
Ooh.

15:44.700 --> 15:45.820
I've seen a lot of that.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.420
So it seems like people are getting them already.

15:47.420 --> 15:49.940
I even got an update from someone.

15:49.940 --> 15:55.860
He got a phone, everything branded with Manjaro and he popped it up and he saw a post-market

15:55.860 --> 16:00.180
where, so I don't know what's going on there, but I linked him the factory image, so maybe

16:00.180 --> 16:04.460
he can test it out and get the proper image on it, but things happen.

16:04.460 --> 16:08.480
At least the branding version is out and everything is working.

16:08.480 --> 16:16.180
And what I also know is it's now the 1.2.B version, which has also stabilized the screen.

16:16.180 --> 16:19.260
So it's a small fix, but it's visible.

16:19.260 --> 16:20.260
Very good.

16:20.260 --> 16:21.260
Well, congratulations.

16:21.260 --> 16:24.540
I think that's, I mean, it's a big deal to actually get those out there.

16:24.540 --> 16:26.420
XMN in the chat room says that he got his.

16:26.420 --> 16:31.420
I wonder if it had Manjaro on it or post-market, but it looks like they're getting out there.

16:31.420 --> 16:34.820
So if you do get some, put them on, put them up somewhere on Reddit or social media or

16:34.820 --> 16:35.820
something.

16:35.820 --> 16:36.820
We'd love to see it.

16:36.820 --> 16:37.820
We do.

16:37.820 --> 16:43.420
I'll drop it in the Telegram group, jupitabroadcasting.com slash telegram and tag me so I can see it

16:43.420 --> 16:46.500
in there because I love it when people get new hardware and I'd love to hear people's

16:46.500 --> 16:47.500
impressions of it.

16:47.500 --> 16:52.060
Well, Phil, thanks for joining us and congrats on the updates and join us again soon when

16:52.060 --> 16:53.060
you got some news.

16:53.060 --> 16:54.060
Okay.

16:54.060 --> 16:55.060
Sure.

16:55.060 --> 16:56.060
Sure.

16:56.060 --> 16:57.060
Will do.

16:57.060 --> 16:58.060
And it's great to have me as well.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.060
I bet.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.060
Yeah.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.940
So we have some more kernel news.

17:01.940 --> 17:03.620
This is looking ahead a little bit.

17:03.620 --> 17:10.860
Here we're talking about 5.9, which most people don't even have yet and 5.10, which is supposed

17:10.860 --> 17:11.980
to be a pretty great release.

17:11.980 --> 17:15.660
We talked about that recently and we're going to go one even further out.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.980
We're going to talk about 5.11 and the reason why I want to do this is I want to make the

17:18.980 --> 17:23.420
point that there's just a lot of good stuff coming down the pipeline for Linux users.

17:23.420 --> 17:29.060
Some fruit company is going to have an announcement next week and actually all kidding aside,

17:29.060 --> 17:32.740
I'm sure Apple is going to have some pretty impressive machines to show.

17:32.740 --> 17:38.820
But I want to remind you, the Mac OS is a bit stale as a platform.

17:38.820 --> 17:43.940
Yes, you can put lipstick on Big Sur and make it more touch friendly, but the underlying

17:43.940 --> 17:48.740
pinnings, they haven't really updated the Unix user land really much ever.

17:48.740 --> 17:53.500
They just kind of drag it along to the latest versions that they can consume from the BSD

17:53.500 --> 17:54.500
projects.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.260
It certainly doesn't feel like it's a priority.

17:56.260 --> 17:58.740
No, I mean, it really doesn't.

17:58.740 --> 18:00.100
It feels like it's funny.

18:00.100 --> 18:04.140
It feels second class now even compared to Windows command line capabilities, right?

18:04.140 --> 18:09.340
Because with WSL and the new Windows Terminal, when you open up the Mac OS Terminal, it's

18:09.340 --> 18:16.620
this little white box with bad fonts and a weird shell and it's just really basic and

18:16.620 --> 18:18.420
there's been no effort.

18:18.420 --> 18:21.460
You really on a Mac to make it work, you need to go get iTerm.

18:21.460 --> 18:22.460
And everyone does.

18:22.460 --> 18:27.300
You need to install Brew and I just want to remind everyone that there's still a lot of

18:27.300 --> 18:29.900
really good stuff coming up for us Linux users.

18:29.900 --> 18:34.380
Not only are our desktop environments getting more kick ass than ever, and I can, I feel

18:34.380 --> 18:39.060
like I can say that having watched this for a long time, but the core stuff that's coming

18:39.060 --> 18:42.540
in the kernel, it's never been better for us desktop users.

18:42.540 --> 18:46.140
We are getting taken care of in a way that I honestly didn't expect.

18:46.140 --> 18:50.780
After years of the cloud being the dominant force for Linux and then Android coming along,

18:50.780 --> 18:56.140
I really was worried that at a kernel level, us desktop users would just be the lowest

18:56.140 --> 18:57.460
priority.

18:57.460 --> 19:01.980
But there are several projects that are landing in 5.9 that are then landing and also landing

19:01.980 --> 19:04.700
in 5.10 that I'm really looking forward to.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.380
And now we have something in kernel 5.11.

19:07.380 --> 19:12.100
And I'm going to take a guess that the name is pronounced Collabora.

19:12.100 --> 19:14.580
We've talked about them before.

19:14.580 --> 19:25.380
And they've been doing work on the Linux kernel recently on behalf of Valve.

19:25.380 --> 19:26.660
So stick with me here.

19:26.660 --> 19:31.300
So we're talking about kernel 5.10, sort of coders for hire over at Collabora have been

19:31.300 --> 19:38.580
hired by Valve to improve Linux gaming, particularly around the things like the Proton compatibility

19:38.580 --> 19:39.580
layer.

19:39.580 --> 19:43.180
So that's what they're sponsoring work again for, something around the compatibility layer.

19:43.180 --> 19:47.980
And one of the big missing pieces right now with Proton games on Linux that has, it sort

19:47.980 --> 19:54.620
of has curbed some of the enthusiasm, if you will, is anti-cheat and DRM technology that's

19:54.620 --> 19:55.900
in some of these games.

19:55.900 --> 20:00.100
It can just entirely break Windows games in wine and Proton.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.600
And we talked about this once before, Wes, on the show.

20:02.600 --> 20:08.700
And we said, unfortunately, it looks like one of the ways to fix this requires modifying

20:08.700 --> 20:09.700
the kernel.

20:09.700 --> 20:11.700
And I said, well, that's never going to happen.

20:11.700 --> 20:14.540
Turns out, maybe it will.

20:14.540 --> 20:19.100
This is some good info from a talk over at the Open Source Summit by Gabriel Crisman-Bertazzi

20:19.100 --> 20:22.140
on the state of Linux gaming.

20:22.140 --> 20:28.500
And one of the key points that he made was system call emulation and adding that functionality.

20:28.500 --> 20:34.260
Because unfortunately, it's just often required because these DRM and anti-cheat systems are

20:34.260 --> 20:38.520
actually issuing system calls directly from the Windows game code.

20:38.520 --> 20:43.540
And that ends up bypassing wine, wine doesn't capture those system calls and then the games

20:43.540 --> 20:44.540
often crash.

20:44.540 --> 20:45.540
Yeah.

20:45.540 --> 20:49.820
And there's really nothing we can do about that unless there's something answering those

20:49.820 --> 20:50.820
system calls.

20:50.820 --> 20:51.820
Yes.

20:51.820 --> 20:55.540
And you know, they tried a user space solution at first, which would have been simpler and

20:55.540 --> 20:58.540
wouldn't have required changing the kernel.

20:58.540 --> 21:03.420
But unfortunately, that was still tripping up DRM and anti-cheat systems and also wasn't

21:03.420 --> 21:04.700
great for performance.

21:04.700 --> 21:09.080
So they've ended up creating the syscall user dispatch, which has been specifically made

21:09.080 --> 21:11.140
in the kernel to deal with these emulated needs.

21:11.140 --> 21:12.140
Isn't that interesting?

21:12.140 --> 21:17.180
It is because it could have wider ramifications beyond gaming when it comes to emulating Windows

21:17.180 --> 21:18.300
software here.

21:18.300 --> 21:22.940
But I think it should be clear, it's not about trying to bring the Windows world to Linux.

21:22.940 --> 21:24.620
They address this in the talk.

21:24.620 --> 21:26.580
They're just trying to ease emulation.

21:26.580 --> 21:32.380
So where that crossover does happen, it works on Linux as good and rock solid as a Linux

21:32.380 --> 21:34.160
application could.

21:34.160 --> 21:39.340
But what it seems has happened is they've kind of expanded to a wider set of what they

21:39.340 --> 21:46.580
call pain points of Linux gaming, including device bring up, solving file system issues,

21:46.580 --> 21:49.260
improving performance in other areas of the system.

21:49.260 --> 21:54.640
They have a team looking at some of the scheduling stuff that maybe could be optimized in future

21:54.640 --> 21:57.380
kernel releases as well.

21:57.380 --> 21:59.380
So all of this stuff works better.

21:59.380 --> 22:04.280
And you've got to think, if a game plays a little bit better because of some performance

22:04.280 --> 22:09.060
improvements in the system and in the vial system, well, then a lot of other things are

22:09.060 --> 22:10.500
going to work better, too.

22:10.500 --> 22:12.620
Probably even your web browser is going to work better, right?

22:12.620 --> 22:19.460
So this could have this could have a lot of nice improvements for Linux users that are

22:19.460 --> 22:22.660
regular desktop users, not even playing video games.

22:22.660 --> 22:23.660
Absolutely.

22:23.660 --> 22:26.620
And, you know, it's just nice sign of this healthy continued collaboration, right?

22:26.620 --> 22:30.260
Like it wasn't just that Proton happened and it was a big dump throw, you know, stuff thrown

22:30.260 --> 22:33.080
over the wall, pushed out there and then kind of left.

22:33.080 --> 22:34.080
It's been actively developed.

22:34.080 --> 22:39.240
And now we're in that rich stage of more advanced secondary problems and smoothing that can

22:39.240 --> 22:40.980
happen like these changes.

22:40.980 --> 22:46.380
With this, what Valve has decided to invest their resources and money into instead of

22:46.380 --> 22:50.460
Steam boxes, one hundred percent OK with that, right?

22:50.460 --> 22:51.460
Way better decision.

22:51.460 --> 22:55.260
And I wonder if that wasn't the calculation because the Steam boxes seem like they're

22:55.260 --> 22:56.260
gone, right?

22:56.260 --> 22:57.260
They do.

22:57.260 --> 22:58.260
Yeah.

22:58.260 --> 22:59.700
Linux gaming is more exciting than ever.

22:59.700 --> 23:01.520
And some of this could land in 5.11.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.100
So thank you to Collabora.

23:03.100 --> 23:06.340
Thank you to Valve and the kernel developers who help integrate this stuff.

23:06.340 --> 23:09.540
Man, am I stoked about that.

23:09.540 --> 23:14.620
Now, another thing, just a quick one here that we talked about a little while ago is

23:14.620 --> 23:20.440
after GNOME Shell 3.3.8, that's the end of the three series.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.020
But I don't know if you recall this part.

23:22.020 --> 23:23.560
You might.

23:23.560 --> 23:28.140
The solution is instead of going to GNOME 4, which is what we've expected forever since

23:28.140 --> 23:29.140
it was.

23:29.140 --> 23:30.220
I mean, we're on three now.

23:30.220 --> 23:35.100
We were on GNOME 2 and then we got GNOME 3 and then we thought we'd get GNOME 4.

23:35.100 --> 23:38.500
And now what we're getting is GNOME 40.

23:38.500 --> 23:44.020
And it looks like we actually have some dates now attached to GNOME 40.

23:44.020 --> 23:45.020
Buckle up.

23:45.020 --> 23:49.060
Yeah, it's slated for release on March 24th, 2021.

23:49.060 --> 23:52.820
And you know, actually, they've simplified the development cycle along with the version

23:52.820 --> 23:56.700
change there, because there will no longer be four development milestones released before

23:56.700 --> 24:01.180
you get to beta, only three with an alpha, a beta and a release candidate.

24:01.180 --> 24:02.180
Huh.

24:02.180 --> 24:03.180
Is that what you say?

24:03.180 --> 24:04.180
Yeah.

24:04.180 --> 24:06.380
I actually think they're going to get some nice efficiency out of that.

24:06.380 --> 24:09.140
And it solves like all these weird like considerations.

24:09.140 --> 24:12.500
And we talked about the logic in a previous show.

24:12.500 --> 24:17.620
But it means the final release of GNOME 40 is set for March 24th, which is just in time.

24:17.620 --> 24:23.280
March 24th, 2021, of course, which is just in time for Ubuntu 21.04, which is due for

24:23.280 --> 24:29.620
release on April 22nd and Fedora 34, which is due for release on April 27th.

24:29.620 --> 24:30.620
Interesting.

24:30.620 --> 24:32.580
Yeah, you know, I hope this goes well.

24:32.580 --> 24:36.100
And I always it seems boring, but I always like to see some of these, you know, development

24:36.100 --> 24:37.100
improvements.

24:37.100 --> 24:40.180
Investing in the process itself, I think, is another sign of a healthy project that's

24:40.180 --> 24:41.900
trying to enable better development.

24:41.900 --> 24:45.660
Tyler, you point out that also lines up nicely with some other important releases.

24:45.660 --> 24:46.660
Yes.

24:46.660 --> 24:52.820
So with the new versioning, it means that GNOME 42 is going to line up with Ubuntu 22.04,

24:52.820 --> 24:57.420
which means that the next Ubuntu LTS will have a desktop that is the answer to life,

24:57.420 --> 24:59.420
the universe and everything.

24:59.420 --> 25:03.940
GNOME Shell 42 better be a real winner, you know, right?

25:03.940 --> 25:04.940
Fingers crossed.

25:04.940 --> 25:05.940
Yeah.

25:05.940 --> 25:06.940
I know.

25:06.940 --> 25:10.020
So that's when you hear these large numbers coming at you in the near future.

25:10.020 --> 25:11.300
That's what's going on.

25:11.300 --> 25:12.300
We knew it was coming.

25:12.300 --> 25:13.900
It's going to be all right.

25:13.900 --> 25:15.420
Just prepare yourself.

25:15.420 --> 25:21.540
Now, anybody want to take the over under on how many years they're trying to work themselves

25:21.540 --> 25:24.660
out of this crazy numbering convention?

25:24.660 --> 25:25.660
Maybe once they get to 100.

25:25.660 --> 25:27.220
Yeah, that's a natural point right there.

25:27.220 --> 25:28.220
Yeah.

25:28.220 --> 25:30.420
Then they start at Roman numerals.

25:30.420 --> 25:31.420
GNOME Shell X.

25:31.420 --> 25:32.420
Yeah.

25:32.420 --> 25:37.220
Oh, this is going to get confusing.

25:37.220 --> 25:39.060
Linode.com slash unplugged.

25:39.060 --> 25:43.020
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account and you go there to support

25:43.020 --> 25:44.300
the show.

25:44.300 --> 25:48.120
Linode is our cloud server provider and because the price is so great, it makes it possible

25:48.120 --> 25:50.700
for a small team to have killer infrastructure.

25:50.700 --> 25:56.860
We have just kick butt fast systems that would have just required crazy expensive systems

25:56.860 --> 25:58.580
back in the rack and stack at day.

25:58.580 --> 26:02.220
And so much planning and development, we don't have time for that.

26:02.220 --> 26:03.220
Great point.

26:03.220 --> 26:04.220
Great point.

26:04.220 --> 26:07.940
One of the things that as a Linux user I love about Linode is they've got like all the distros

26:07.940 --> 26:08.940
you'd want.

26:08.940 --> 26:13.140
The Alpines, Arch, recent CentOS releases, Debian releases.

26:13.140 --> 26:17.060
Of course, they have Fedora 33 on there and other Fedora releases, same with OpenSUSE

26:17.060 --> 26:18.300
and Ubuntu.

26:18.300 --> 26:19.300
You choose.

26:19.300 --> 26:21.580
And they also have pre-built systems if that's your style.

26:21.580 --> 26:22.580
Yeah, right.

26:22.580 --> 26:26.100
Depending on like if you're doing a stack script or an image, is you can actually swap

26:26.100 --> 26:28.340
out the distro for the pre-built thing you want.

26:28.340 --> 26:29.340
Oh, that's neat.

26:29.340 --> 26:33.420
If you want to use Debian instead of OpenSUSE, so you just choose that and then generate

26:33.420 --> 26:34.420
it.

26:34.420 --> 26:35.420
It's the one you're more comfortable with.

26:35.420 --> 26:36.420
Yeah.

26:36.420 --> 26:40.620
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing before AWS because they

26:40.620 --> 26:42.020
saw what Linux could do.

26:42.020 --> 26:45.820
As Linux users, and that kind of speaks to me too, is that I really saw what Linux could

26:45.820 --> 26:47.760
do when I was in IT.

26:47.760 --> 26:51.880
And I pivoted from the Windows line of things over to the Linux line of things.

26:51.880 --> 26:53.500
And it's because I saw where this was going.

26:53.500 --> 26:57.660
And Linode was like way ahead of the game, way before AWS.

26:57.660 --> 26:59.380
And they're independently owned too.

26:59.380 --> 27:02.920
So they didn't have to go get a bunch of VC funding, which just to go crazy, hire like

27:02.920 --> 27:06.980
nuts, build out all this infrastructure, get all this debt and then sell yourself.

27:06.980 --> 27:09.940
Instead, they built it up themselves and they own it.

27:09.940 --> 27:12.780
And they're dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing out there.

27:12.780 --> 27:15.140
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

27:15.140 --> 27:18.740
So I want to encourage you to take advantage of our $100 60-day credit.

27:18.740 --> 27:23.460
You go to linode.com slash unplugged, you support the show, you get a $100 60-day credit

27:23.460 --> 27:24.460
towards a new account.

27:24.460 --> 27:26.420
Well, isn't that kind of nice?

27:26.420 --> 27:28.900
Go to linode.com slash unplugged.

27:28.900 --> 27:31.140
Thank you to Linode for sponsoring the unplugged program.

27:31.140 --> 27:34.460
And thank you to everybody who goes to our sponsor page, lets them know you heard about

27:34.460 --> 27:41.020
it here and tries out their offers, linode.com slash unplugged.

27:41.020 --> 27:46.700
So I teased it at the beginning of the show, but there is a platform that is super interesting

27:46.700 --> 27:50.020
that I always thought would be really great if it came to Linux.

27:50.020 --> 27:55.100
And then I got an email about the Windows calculator getting ported over to Linux, like

27:55.100 --> 27:56.100
the open source.

27:56.100 --> 27:59.860
And I thought, well, how does this work?

27:59.860 --> 28:03.500
And what did it take to get this Uno platform on Linux?

28:03.500 --> 28:07.700
Because one of its tricks is it's not like an electron based setup.

28:07.700 --> 28:13.820
What it is, is native applications on each destination hosts OS.

28:13.820 --> 28:17.660
And I figured to get that to work on Linux, that must have been quite the journey.

28:17.660 --> 28:21.140
So I had their CTO from the Uno platform come on the show.

28:21.140 --> 28:24.780
So I'm Jerome, I'm the CTO at Uno platform.

28:24.780 --> 28:29.740
And Jerome and I went through a couple of things like what it took to get Uno over here.

28:29.740 --> 28:33.820
We talked about his Linux setup a little bit, the feedback he got from the Linux community,

28:33.820 --> 28:40.860
the technology stack that they used, the reaction to choosing snap packages and how they handled

28:40.860 --> 28:45.740
that feedback as a company that was new to the Linux community, that's all in there.

28:45.740 --> 28:50.720
So I started with Jerome by congratulating him on the Uno platform and the big release

28:50.720 --> 28:53.100
that I think was more than a year in the making for Linux.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.620
Yeah, thank you.

28:54.620 --> 28:57.580
It was an amazing one, a great response from the community.

28:57.580 --> 28:58.580
Good, good.

28:58.580 --> 29:04.980
Well, so I'm pretty new to the Uno platform and I was doing a little digging around and

29:04.980 --> 29:09.260
I saw the first commit was by you on May 7th, 2018.

29:09.260 --> 29:16.600
And now here we are in October of 2020 and the Windows calculator has been essentially

29:16.600 --> 29:20.020
ported to Linux using the Uno platform and that caught my attention.

29:20.020 --> 29:23.380
So can you explain to me what the Uno platform is?

29:23.380 --> 29:24.380
Sure.

29:24.380 --> 29:29.460
So the Uno platform is developer tooling and framework that allows for developers that

29:29.460 --> 29:32.160
know about C-Sharp and XAML.

29:32.160 --> 29:38.640
So the main Windows development toolkit that's for Windows developers to basically take their

29:38.640 --> 29:48.600
code and port it over to iOS, Android, WebAssembly, Mac OS, Windows 7 in some cases, and Linux.

29:48.600 --> 29:52.300
So that's a lot of platforms to target, but that's the basic idea.

29:52.300 --> 29:58.060
And we want to make sure that people can reuse their skills that they have mostly on Windows,

29:58.060 --> 30:04.140
but now with the interest of Linux being able to target one platform and then have it run

30:04.140 --> 30:06.420
over to the others without changing much.

30:06.420 --> 30:13.140
Well, it seems like there's been a dozen or more promises over the years of a single code

30:13.140 --> 30:14.140
base.

30:14.140 --> 30:15.140
Yes.

30:15.140 --> 30:19.500
But like a lot of times the downside seems to be generally it may be one or two things,

30:19.500 --> 30:24.700
potentially performance, but often you sacrifice what I would say like a native UI experience.

30:24.700 --> 30:29.340
So as Linux users we'll often kind of get left out in that scenario.

30:29.340 --> 30:31.460
Does the Uno platform address that differently?

30:31.460 --> 30:34.620
Uno platforms were originally built for iOS and Android.

30:34.620 --> 30:40.180
And there's always two sets of people, there's the ones that want to have the same UI everywhere

30:40.180 --> 30:46.240
and there are other people that do want to have close to the platform and have some tweaks

30:46.240 --> 30:48.040
around to be able to run on those devices.

30:48.040 --> 30:53.900
So let's say that if you are on iOS, you want to have the iOS UI and Android UI to have

30:53.900 --> 30:57.860
the Android UI specific for that one.

30:57.860 --> 31:02.820
The problem is that in some of the frameworks that are doing this, React Native is kind

31:02.820 --> 31:07.100
of close to that, for instance, is that you only can do that.

31:07.100 --> 31:10.780
And then if you want to do some custom drawing, then it gets difficult.

31:10.780 --> 31:15.740
So what we did with the Uno platform and we took what Microsoft has been doing for a while

31:15.740 --> 31:22.680
with the XAML tooling and extended it to be able to do what is called look less control.

31:22.680 --> 31:27.500
So let's say if you want to create a button, then in your markup or whatever that you're

31:27.500 --> 31:32.040
using, then you create your button and then underneath you can style it to use whatever

31:32.040 --> 31:35.540
the platform provides or your own style if you want to.

31:35.540 --> 31:40.000
So if you're running on iOS, you're going to have your native button or toggle switch

31:40.000 --> 31:42.240
or checkbox or whatnot.

31:42.240 --> 31:47.260
Or you can change that style of that button that you've put in your code and then it can

31:47.260 --> 31:52.660
render to whatever your fancy designers are going to be wanting to have, like a new video

31:52.660 --> 31:53.840
button or whatever.

31:53.840 --> 31:56.300
So that's the kind of things, the two ways to render.

31:56.300 --> 31:57.300
I see.

31:57.300 --> 31:59.740
So and that happens at build time of the project?

31:59.740 --> 32:02.660
It renders out each native UI?

32:02.660 --> 32:06.180
No, it really is at runtime.

32:06.180 --> 32:07.180
You can actually switch.

32:07.180 --> 32:11.540
We have a demo somewhere that shows that you can basically have a button and then you can

32:11.540 --> 32:17.420
change the style of the button or the checkbox or whatnot at runtime so you can data bind

32:17.420 --> 32:21.580
it to change it, change it visually so that it looks the way you want to.

32:21.580 --> 32:26.220
So it's not really useful to change that style at runtime, but you can have a default style

32:26.220 --> 32:30.500
if you want to for one specific page and then for another page you can have something else.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.560
So that's the kind of things that happens.

32:32.560 --> 32:38.220
And on the Linux side, does that target, say, like a single toolkit like GTK or Qt?

32:38.220 --> 32:40.060
Yeah, so that's where I'm talking about.

32:40.060 --> 32:42.740
There's a second way to look at that.

32:42.740 --> 32:49.100
So the first way is we're using what the native primitives of the platforms are able to provide

32:49.100 --> 32:50.100
us.

32:50.100 --> 32:54.660
So let's say the ability to draw a combo box or a rectangle, something like that, but using

32:54.660 --> 32:55.660
the platform primitives.

32:55.660 --> 33:02.340
So we're instructing iOS or Android to draw a rectangle the way a native Android and iOS

33:02.340 --> 33:04.140
application would do.

33:04.140 --> 33:08.780
And then when we're going to the other platforms, people are asking us, I want to be able to

33:08.780 --> 33:10.320
draw by the pixel.

33:10.320 --> 33:13.180
So some of those users, not all of them.

33:13.180 --> 33:14.420
So I want to draw by the pixel.

33:14.420 --> 33:22.800
So what we said is, okay, so let's build a by the pixel render or backend rendering system

33:22.800 --> 33:27.380
that allows us to take the same thing that we're doing on the other platforms that are

33:27.380 --> 33:29.020
not specific to the platform.

33:29.020 --> 33:33.840
So let's say if you want to render a button that has specific corners, a text inside,

33:33.840 --> 33:36.360
that is the same everywhere, but we're going to be using Skia.

33:36.360 --> 33:43.360
So the rendering engine that Chrome uses to render itself, we're using this to render

33:43.360 --> 33:45.260
the applications on Linux for now.

33:45.260 --> 33:46.260
Oh, fascinating.

33:46.260 --> 33:48.220
But that doesn't mean that we're going to stay there.

33:48.220 --> 33:50.320
It's one of the rendering methods that we're using.

33:50.320 --> 33:55.420
So for instance, and that means for that matter, that's your application for now, let's say

33:55.420 --> 33:58.380
the calculator, the Windows calculator, we put it over.

33:58.380 --> 34:05.740
That one is really not using any of the GTK primitives to render a button or text or something

34:05.740 --> 34:06.740
like that.

34:06.740 --> 34:09.600
It's really drawing a canvas and pixel one by one.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.720
So that's what's happening right now.

34:11.720 --> 34:14.940
But we have the ability to change that and use another thing.

34:14.940 --> 34:19.380
So let's say if we were to be having someone that says, well, I really want to have a GTK

34:19.380 --> 34:22.980
rendering backend or a cube rendering backend or any kind of rendering backend that would

34:22.980 --> 34:27.680
make sense, then it's possible to do that and actually use those controls there.

34:27.680 --> 34:31.140
So it's an effort to do that and we're not there yet.

34:31.140 --> 34:37.280
But the point was to be able to say, well, we're able to run that kind of UI natively

34:37.280 --> 34:42.500
if you will, because we're rendering every pixel, but it's not an Electron app, for instance.

34:42.500 --> 34:46.540
It really is an application running as a GTK shell.

34:46.540 --> 34:48.140
We're actually using a GTK shell.

34:48.140 --> 34:51.220
The window itself is built upon GTK.

34:51.220 --> 34:52.480
Ah, very good.

34:52.480 --> 34:55.820
And I think maybe that's one of the key differentiators here, isn't it?

34:55.820 --> 34:59.500
You can take advantage of, it sounds like Skia, which is part of Chrome, but that doesn't

34:59.500 --> 35:01.100
mean we're using Electron here.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.100
No, no, no, no.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.100
Not at all.

35:03.100 --> 35:04.100
Not at all.

35:04.100 --> 35:05.100
Yeah.

35:05.100 --> 35:06.100
That's really fascinating.

35:06.100 --> 35:07.100
So I wanted to zoom out a little bit.

35:07.100 --> 35:08.860
This is relatively new for the Uno platform.

35:08.860 --> 35:12.980
This is kind of, it's, and also porting the Windows calculator, which is pretty, like

35:12.980 --> 35:14.460
that's the current Windows 10 calculator.

35:14.460 --> 35:15.460
That's pretty great.

35:15.460 --> 35:16.460
It is.

35:16.460 --> 35:17.460
And that's a great tech demo.

35:17.460 --> 35:20.340
So what were the challenges coming over to Linux?

35:20.340 --> 35:23.340
And before you answer that, I'm also curious, why now?

35:23.340 --> 35:27.940
Why, why put the effort into supporting Linux now in October of, well, I'm sure you started

35:27.940 --> 35:28.940
sooner, but why now?

35:28.940 --> 35:30.980
We actually did start sooner.

35:30.980 --> 35:37.340
It's actually a year old of effort because we had a few technical challenges to make

35:37.340 --> 35:39.620
sure that it's not the Linux support itself.

35:39.620 --> 35:45.160
It was all about making sure that the.NET platform was running properly and on Linux.

35:45.160 --> 35:50.040
And many of those things have been evolving the last year, but most of the tech challenges

35:50.040 --> 35:55.180
for us was on Uno itself, to restructure it properly so that it actually supports all

35:55.180 --> 35:57.260
the platforms at once.

35:57.260 --> 36:03.580
And what happens then is that for us, adding the Skia backend support was akin to modifying

36:03.580 --> 36:04.900
the WebAssembly support.

36:04.900 --> 36:11.260
So the WebAssembly support for Uno shares, I think it was something like close to 90%

36:11.260 --> 36:15.840
of the code is the same as the one that is used for the Skia rendering backend.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.540
So it's very, very close.

36:17.540 --> 36:18.540
Fascinating.

36:18.540 --> 36:19.540
Okay.

36:19.540 --> 36:24.860
I think really kind of my last question is, what scope of applications do you see the

36:24.860 --> 36:28.180
Uno platform being the right solution for?

36:28.180 --> 36:29.540
What scale of applications?

36:29.540 --> 36:34.500
The first commit that you see publicly on the Uno platform, the GitHub, the open source

36:34.500 --> 36:41.460
repo is dating from 2018, but it actually started in 2013.

36:41.460 --> 36:44.360
So it's been a while that we've been developing this.

36:44.360 --> 36:49.500
And most of the applications that we have been doing on iOS and Android are actually

36:49.500 --> 36:51.860
consumer grade applications and they're actually quite big.

36:51.860 --> 37:00.940
So we're talking movie theater, movie theater, drugstores, there's a natural geographic application

37:00.940 --> 37:06.460
that is used for people that are non-native speakers, English speakers to learn English.

37:06.460 --> 37:10.180
So that kind of new large application that are interesting.

37:10.180 --> 37:16.460
But now that we've expanded that with the web and with Mac OS and Linux, we're seeing

37:16.460 --> 37:24.220
people that are getting interested into making a lot larger application like line of business

37:24.220 --> 37:25.220
applications.

37:25.220 --> 37:29.980
The ones that have ugly interfaces sometimes or have nice interfaces, but lots of screens

37:29.980 --> 37:31.260
to show.

37:31.260 --> 37:37.340
So that's the kind of thing that we're looking at and we're making lots of progress for that.

37:37.340 --> 37:42.020
And for the Linux part specifically, that's where it gets interesting.

37:42.020 --> 37:47.720
A lot of people have been asking us, well, I want to be able to run on Linux specifically

37:47.720 --> 37:55.860
because I want to do IoT or I want to do very specific things with my Linux only server

37:55.860 --> 38:00.860
that runs something for my research project or whatever, and I cannot run something else.

38:00.860 --> 38:06.300
So that's the kind of thing that we're seeing.

38:06.300 --> 38:10.980
But they know about C-sharp and they want to make that application run over or they

38:10.980 --> 38:14.940
want to target both the web and the Linux because they want to have something that deploys

38:14.940 --> 38:18.080
very easily and don't want to bother with any kind of stores.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.700
So that's the kind of story that we're seeing there.

38:20.700 --> 38:25.940
And adding Linux support for it is, and I've been doing Linux for, I started on Linux on

38:25.940 --> 38:31.660
the first Red Hat release that was there in early 20, I think it was 1999 something.

38:31.660 --> 38:32.660
So it dates back.

38:32.660 --> 38:36.020
So it's kind of a dear heart for me.

38:36.020 --> 38:37.540
It's been a while.

38:37.540 --> 38:42.580
And so getting all that running, can you circle back to Linux after all this time?

38:42.580 --> 38:46.340
It's really nice to see all those people getting interested into having applications running

38:46.340 --> 38:47.340
there.

38:47.340 --> 38:48.340
I bet.

38:48.340 --> 38:49.620
Well, now I have to ask, do you have a current Linux box?

38:49.620 --> 38:51.180
And if so, what's the setup?

38:51.180 --> 38:53.020
I'm running mainly on Windows for now.

38:53.020 --> 38:54.860
I actually have multiple things.

38:54.860 --> 39:00.820
So I have a mix of Linux boxes that are running for IoT stuff that I have on my machine.

39:00.820 --> 39:06.620
My machine is a Windows 10, but I have multiple WSL setups that are installed there so I can

39:06.620 --> 39:09.020
test with all the different distros there.

39:09.020 --> 39:16.540
I have an Ubuntu machine that's actually a Raspberry Pi running on it, plus a bunch

39:16.540 --> 39:21.180
of other stuff with build machines for the calculators specifically.

39:21.180 --> 39:24.240
So they're running on Ubuntu servers.

39:24.240 --> 39:25.460
So lots of things.

39:25.460 --> 39:28.300
That sounds like a pretty typical developer setup.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.940
There's always a range of machines.

39:30.940 --> 39:31.940
Exactly.

39:31.940 --> 39:32.940
Plus a Mac.

39:32.940 --> 39:33.940
Because I'm doing iOS stuff.

39:33.940 --> 39:34.940
Sure.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.820
It's interesting to hear WSL getting a workout.

39:36.820 --> 39:39.660
I think kind of how Microsoft intended it to be used.

39:39.660 --> 39:40.660
So that's fascinating.

39:40.660 --> 39:41.660
Yes.

39:41.660 --> 39:42.660
Yes.

39:42.660 --> 39:47.260
And with regards to developers, it's all about expanding horizons.

39:47.260 --> 39:54.300
And I see Mac OS users, they want to go and use Windows.

39:54.300 --> 39:58.940
They don't want to be left out with their own tooling that they were Unix-like.

39:58.940 --> 40:01.620
So they're using WSL for that.

40:01.620 --> 40:06.060
There are other users that are just plain Windows users, but they have fancy tooling

40:06.060 --> 40:12.460
that comes from Linux and they can use it that way without having to install it or maintain

40:12.460 --> 40:16.780
the Linux box because maybe that's not their main way to develop that.

40:16.780 --> 40:22.300
Or plain just Linux users that say, well, I have a Windows box and I want to do anything

40:22.300 --> 40:23.460
with it, just gaming.

40:23.460 --> 40:27.320
But I like my tooling so I can use that there.

40:27.320 --> 40:28.320
So that's the kind of things.

40:28.320 --> 40:33.460
Jerome, you're sort of sitting in a fascinating position as a developer.

40:33.460 --> 40:37.420
Sounds like you've been in the Linux community in one form or another for a very, very long

40:37.420 --> 40:38.420
time.

40:38.420 --> 40:40.580
You've seen the transformation that Microsoft is making.

40:40.580 --> 40:44.220
Uno Platform relies on some fundamental Microsoft technologies.

40:44.220 --> 40:47.720
Also, I think you guys have a relationship to some degree with Canonical.

40:47.720 --> 40:50.760
This is being distributed as a snap package.

40:50.760 --> 40:57.200
This is almost a unicorn position in a sense, but I think one that's going to become a lot

40:57.200 --> 40:58.200
more common.

40:58.200 --> 41:02.260
I don't know, maybe you're not the first to this little, this quadfecta that we have here,

41:02.260 --> 41:06.100
but it seems like this is maybe the new reality and from where you're sitting as a longtime

41:06.100 --> 41:10.100
Linux user, I'm curious on your thoughts of where we're at right now with all this.

41:10.100 --> 41:15.900
To be very honest, the last couple of years, let's say three or four years, I didn't follow

41:15.900 --> 41:21.400
all the details about the packaging stories and I discovered that there's quite a few

41:21.400 --> 41:25.980
new ones and IU snapped in one way or another.

41:25.980 --> 41:31.580
But I stayed on the RPM and APT for a very long time, so that was my way of deploying

41:31.580 --> 41:33.380
applications without any store.

41:33.380 --> 41:36.340
There's always multiple ways to do things in Linux.

41:36.340 --> 41:37.620
There's always.

41:37.620 --> 41:45.060
But what surprised me is the community's response to snap specifically and the fact that it's

41:45.060 --> 41:50.380
not so there's the technology itself, but there's the fact that it's also all about

41:50.380 --> 41:53.820
having something with a centralized way of doing things.

41:53.820 --> 41:56.220
It's not about canonical or anything like that.

41:56.220 --> 41:59.700
It's just, I want to be able to install my things by myself.

41:59.700 --> 42:03.960
I don't want someone to spy on me or maybe tentatively spy on me because that's not the

42:03.960 --> 42:09.380
case for the calculator, but let's say, and so that's the kind of things that it's all

42:09.380 --> 42:10.380
about choice.

42:10.380 --> 42:15.460
And seeing that I said, well, I'm going to try to do a nap image of the calculator.

42:15.460 --> 42:17.500
So there's an app image of the calculator now.

42:17.500 --> 42:18.820
You're saying you got a lot of feedback.

42:18.820 --> 42:19.820
I take it.

42:19.820 --> 42:20.820
I did.

42:20.820 --> 42:26.700
I got a lot of feedback and I read all of it, kind of skim through because there's snarky

42:26.700 --> 42:34.100
comments and so skimming, but anyways, the interesting part is that knowing about the

42:34.100 --> 42:41.060
preferences of people and what's available, I see snap as being a very easy commodity

42:41.060 --> 42:42.920
way of installing things.

42:42.920 --> 42:45.380
Same thing as a flat pack would be the same way.

42:45.380 --> 42:53.820
But the idea is that people that are new to that space and using Linux for better or worse,

42:53.820 --> 42:59.860
they're accustomed to installing application in a simple way from a user interface.

42:59.860 --> 43:06.420
And I reckon that people that are the same ones that are going to be installing ArcLinux

43:06.420 --> 43:11.800
or that kind of distribution that there's no UI and you install everything by the command

43:11.800 --> 43:16.700
line and knowing all the options by heart, they don't want to have that kind of things

43:16.700 --> 43:17.700
and that makes sense.

43:17.700 --> 43:23.460
So that's why being able to have a wide variety of ways to install packages is important.

43:23.460 --> 43:29.340
Would you say that the use of snaps is more controversial than say the use of mono or

43:29.340 --> 43:31.500
anything into that regard from the Microsoft side?

43:31.500 --> 43:35.540
It seems like it was pretty strong feedback and maybe I also wonder if it wasn't for your

43:35.540 --> 43:39.700
longtime Linux experience that helped you convert that into actionable items versus

43:39.700 --> 43:41.300
like, oh gosh, we've upset everybody.

43:41.300 --> 43:42.300
No, no, no.

43:42.300 --> 43:43.300
Not at all.

43:43.300 --> 43:44.300
Not at all.

43:44.300 --> 43:50.080
And I mean, to be honest on that part, because we've been introducing the Microsoft side

43:50.080 --> 43:52.380
of it in many ways.

43:52.380 --> 43:57.060
So let's say people have been, so I'm going to show you the wide range of responses that

43:57.060 --> 43:58.060
we got.

43:58.060 --> 44:03.340
On the iOS community, oh, this is C-sharp, this is not a native application, or it actually

44:03.340 --> 44:08.380
is, but it looks different, it's not the same or it's not objective C code, so I'm not going

44:08.380 --> 44:09.380
to use it.

44:09.380 --> 44:10.420
So that's the iOS part.

44:10.420 --> 44:13.660
On Android, they say, oh, that's not the kind of application that I want.

44:13.660 --> 44:17.340
And it's having people that are developing things because they want to go faster.

44:17.340 --> 44:20.460
They say, oh, the UI looks like iOS, I don't want it.

44:20.460 --> 44:23.100
So that's the kind of response that we can also get from that one.

44:23.100 --> 44:26.620
Then on the WebAssembly side, we say, oh, WebAssembly, that's not good.

44:26.620 --> 44:30.900
I mean, it's something that looks, it's not JavaScript, so it sucks.

44:30.900 --> 44:32.580
So I'm not going to use it.

44:32.580 --> 44:36.420
That's the kind of responses that we get from communities because you're kind of an outsider

44:36.420 --> 44:38.860
way of looking at that.

44:38.860 --> 44:39.860
And that's fine.

44:39.860 --> 44:46.700
It's all about adjusting how we present things, and I was pretty sure we were going to get

44:46.700 --> 44:52.340
some kind of feedback in one way or another, and snap being one, and that's fine.

44:52.340 --> 44:57.620
So we are adjusting for that and adding other ways to do that.

44:57.620 --> 45:03.500
And now from the part with Microsoft specifically, I mean, Canonical, they have a relationship,

45:03.500 --> 45:06.340
but that's not Microsoft pushing there.

45:06.340 --> 45:11.420
Microsoft is specifically for WSL, they're providing something to enable Linux to work

45:11.420 --> 45:15.460
there and happens to be that Canonical was one of the first to do that, but that's pretty

45:15.460 --> 45:16.460
much it.

45:16.460 --> 45:21.780
Now, for the calculator part, I mean, there's no Microsoft at all.

45:21.780 --> 45:24.920
That's just Uno Platform, that we did that on our own.

45:24.920 --> 45:29.780
So there's no pushing of any kind of agenda coming from Microsoft or any way.

45:29.780 --> 45:30.780
Right.

45:30.780 --> 45:31.780
It just makes a great demo.

45:31.780 --> 45:32.780
It does.

45:32.780 --> 45:33.780
It does.

45:33.780 --> 45:34.780
And we're not done yet.

45:34.780 --> 45:37.380
There's a lot of things that need to be worked out, like the fact that you cannot use the

45:37.380 --> 45:44.180
keyboard keys to type in the calculator for now, because we haven't had added the keystroke

45:44.180 --> 45:45.500
support for now.

45:45.500 --> 45:47.880
So that's the kind of thing that is going to evolve.

45:47.880 --> 45:52.060
And we've seen from the announcement people saying, well, that's Microsoft, they're going

45:52.060 --> 45:54.940
to invade the Linux space and they're going to extinguish.

45:54.940 --> 45:57.260
No, it's not Microsoft.

45:57.260 --> 45:58.380
It's just Uno Platform.

45:58.380 --> 46:00.900
We like the tech, we like Linux, and we're going there.

46:00.900 --> 46:02.540
And the calculator is open source.

46:02.540 --> 46:03.540
Exactly.

46:03.540 --> 46:04.540
Exactly.

46:04.540 --> 46:08.980
So the last point on the Snap thing is, my thought about it always is, is that it seems

46:08.980 --> 46:16.500
to me having a central software repository that is ran by a company that you can interface

46:16.500 --> 46:17.500
with, right?

46:17.500 --> 46:19.620
You can have a relationship with people at Canonical.

46:19.620 --> 46:24.220
I think that is worth something for people that want to distribute software on the Linux

46:24.220 --> 46:25.220
platform.

46:25.220 --> 46:28.620
And that's generally my answer to all the Snap hate, is you have to understand the larger

46:28.620 --> 46:29.620
ecosystem.

46:29.620 --> 46:30.620
Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.

46:30.620 --> 46:31.700
It makes a lot of sense.

46:31.700 --> 46:36.060
And it must not be the same, the only way to distribute software.

46:36.060 --> 46:41.180
And that's why being able to distribute as any kind of other distribution mechanism has

46:41.180 --> 46:44.940
to be available and supported in some ways.

46:44.940 --> 46:49.220
That's why AppImage is amazing because you just pack everything in one package and then

46:49.220 --> 46:50.860
it runs without installing anything.

46:50.860 --> 46:52.820
So that's pretty good.

46:52.820 --> 46:58.980
But for people that want to discover the interface, if my application is only distributed on GitHub,

46:58.980 --> 47:01.020
how do I go and find it?

47:01.020 --> 47:02.940
It's quite difficult to get there.

47:02.940 --> 47:08.500
On the other end, if you're publishing something on Snap and like Apple, they don't want you

47:08.500 --> 47:13.900
to distribute any kind of very specific application because the local laws prevent you from publishing

47:13.900 --> 47:16.380
your application there.

47:16.380 --> 47:17.740
Maybe you don't want to abide by that.

47:17.740 --> 47:21.220
So there's a balance to get somewhere.

47:21.220 --> 47:28.000
For us, it was about being able to be published on a store that shows the applications there.

47:28.000 --> 47:35.300
And for people that don't know much about Linux or the kid that got a Raspberry Pi

47:35.300 --> 47:41.060
at Christmas and then wants to install something and then just happens up to have Ubuntu running

47:41.060 --> 47:44.900
there and then just click through and then just the applications get there.

47:44.900 --> 47:49.260
And then they end up learning about Linux afterwards.

47:49.260 --> 47:54.660
That's the kind of scenario that I'm looking at, not the high-end tech user that knows

47:54.660 --> 47:59.380
how to change anything on their platform by heart.

47:59.380 --> 48:00.380
Right.

48:00.380 --> 48:01.380
We're really kind of the future.

48:01.380 --> 48:05.660
And tip of the hat to you for taking that feedback and rolling with it and then taking

48:05.660 --> 48:09.820
action on it and making it available in more ways and targeting what looks like a future

48:09.820 --> 48:10.820
generation of developers.

48:10.820 --> 48:13.900
Jerome, I'm pretty excited about it and I'll be keeping an eye on the platform.

48:13.900 --> 48:14.900
Thanks for joining us.

48:14.900 --> 48:15.900
Yeah, of course.

48:15.900 --> 48:16.900
Thank you.

48:16.900 --> 48:21.100
Let's do a little housekeeping, Mr. Payne.

48:21.100 --> 48:22.100
Let's do it.

48:22.100 --> 48:27.420
I encourage you all to join the Luplug this Sunday and perhaps into the future because

48:27.420 --> 48:30.100
something very fun is beginning to happen over there.

48:30.100 --> 48:35.700
They got something special brewing and there's talks, there's recordings, but also another

48:35.700 --> 48:44.300
JB Bugathon on November 22nd at noon Pacific in the JB Mumble Room in the lobby.

48:44.300 --> 48:47.780
There's a new release of Jellyfin in the works and the developers have reached out in our

48:47.780 --> 48:52.960
Matrix Bugathon chat and asked if we would help test it and the Luplug has stepped up

48:52.960 --> 48:53.960
to the challenge.

48:53.960 --> 48:56.680
And if you'd like to help test the next release of Jellyfin, you have some time.

48:56.680 --> 48:59.620
It's November 22nd as we record this.

48:59.620 --> 49:00.620
Hey, that's great.

49:00.620 --> 49:04.500
I mean, I'm a Jellyfin user myself and it's already doing well and this could only make

49:04.500 --> 49:05.500
it better.

49:05.500 --> 49:06.980
And I've been thinking about switching more and more.

49:06.980 --> 49:07.980
It's really nice.

49:07.980 --> 49:10.020
Yeah, just minimal does what you need.

49:10.020 --> 49:11.020
Not a lot of fuss.

49:11.020 --> 49:12.680
But there could be some talks coming up in there.

49:12.680 --> 49:14.060
There's all kinds of stuff in the works.

49:14.060 --> 49:15.060
So check it out.

49:15.060 --> 49:16.060
Luplug.

49:16.060 --> 49:19.920
Also, I want to mention, if you haven't yet, you might consider grabbing the All Shows

49:19.920 --> 49:21.740
feed for Jupiter Broadcasting.

49:21.740 --> 49:23.500
Get all the stuff coming out.

49:23.500 --> 49:27.100
Wes has now joined me on Linux Action News.

49:27.100 --> 49:31.740
First episode is out and we're changing just a few things up.

49:31.740 --> 49:33.120
I'd love to have you check it out.

49:33.120 --> 49:35.780
Not much, just a couple of tweaks here and there.

49:35.780 --> 49:42.500
So go check out Linux Action News if you haven't for a little bit because we're trying to make

49:42.500 --> 49:45.060
it a little fresh with Wes on there.

49:45.060 --> 49:47.100
A little fresh, but with everything you love.

49:47.100 --> 49:48.100
Fresh with Wes.

49:48.100 --> 49:49.100
Fresh with Wes.

49:49.100 --> 49:50.100
So check that out.

49:50.100 --> 49:52.540
If you're on the All Shows RSS feed, you're going to get stuff like that already.

49:52.540 --> 49:53.540
Just shows up.

49:53.540 --> 49:54.540
Yeah.

49:54.540 --> 49:55.540
So search for that.

49:55.540 --> 49:58.900
There's also a link at JupiterBroadcasting.com and we'd love to have you get all of the

49:58.900 --> 49:59.900
shows.

49:59.900 --> 50:02.060
All right, Wes, I think that's all the housekeeping for this week.

50:02.060 --> 50:05.540
Nice and nice today.

50:05.540 --> 50:06.820
Let's get into some feedback.

50:06.820 --> 50:09.900
We have three emails that came into the show.

50:09.900 --> 50:10.900
How about I'll take the first one?

50:10.900 --> 50:11.900
You want to do that?

50:11.900 --> 50:12.900
Let's do it.

50:12.900 --> 50:13.900
Okay.

50:13.900 --> 50:18.180
Wes says, falling for Fedora says, hey, Chris and Wes, long time Ubuntu user, but after

50:18.180 --> 50:22.820
listening to your show and after listening to about four months of this, I decided to

50:22.820 --> 50:24.980
give Fedora a go.

50:24.980 --> 50:26.420
Oh, interesting.

50:26.420 --> 50:31.700
It was also kind of sped up by the timing of a new ThinkPad T14 purchase with Renoir

50:31.700 --> 50:32.700
graphics.

50:32.700 --> 50:33.700
What do you think, Wes?

50:33.700 --> 50:34.700
You know what I want to call it?

50:34.700 --> 50:38.340
I want to call it Rainier graphics, but let's just go with that.

50:38.340 --> 50:40.260
Only you and I would get that reference.

50:40.260 --> 50:43.820
He said, I needed kernel 5.6 or above, so I have to say I'm really impressed with Fedora

50:43.820 --> 50:47.860
32, and now I have to decide if I'm going to upgrade to 33 or maybe switch and try Pop

50:47.860 --> 50:48.860
OS.

50:48.860 --> 50:52.780
Hey, welcome to my struggle right now.

50:52.780 --> 50:58.380
It's bad because I am in that phase where I'm trying to do apt on a DNF box, and I'm

50:58.380 --> 50:59.380
doing DNF on an app box.

50:59.380 --> 51:00.860
You don't know what you're doing.

51:00.860 --> 51:08.660
Oh, it's just, yeah, it really is a struggle, which this is totally my doing, Wes, but it's

51:08.660 --> 51:13.740
because I put pop theme on all of them.

51:13.740 --> 51:14.740
You know?

51:14.740 --> 51:15.740
Yeah, you can't tell what system I'm on.

51:15.740 --> 51:16.740
Yeah.

51:16.740 --> 51:18.620
I've just really done myself in.

51:18.620 --> 51:21.100
I really have been happy with Fedora 33.

51:21.100 --> 51:22.100
Are you still running it?

51:22.100 --> 51:23.100
Yeah.

51:23.100 --> 51:24.100
Yeah?

51:24.100 --> 51:25.740
I've been really, really, really happy with it.

51:25.740 --> 51:33.100
There's something just super solid about it, and I really like it, but I also really

51:33.100 --> 51:37.700
have been happy with Pop, so you just got to try them both out and see what works for

51:37.700 --> 51:38.700
you.

51:38.700 --> 51:39.700
Too many good choices.

51:39.700 --> 51:40.700
That's a nice problem.

51:40.700 --> 51:41.700
Yeah.

51:41.700 --> 51:42.700
He's also going to give Leno to try.

51:42.700 --> 51:44.060
Hey, that's great.

51:44.060 --> 51:45.060
Just signed up with our link.

51:45.060 --> 51:47.700
Yeah, I'm going to put NextCloud on there.

51:47.700 --> 51:49.420
He says, thanks from New Zealand.

51:49.420 --> 51:50.420
That is pretty great.

51:50.420 --> 51:51.620
Thanks, Brett, for giving us an update.

51:51.620 --> 51:53.220
Good luck on picking your distribution.

51:53.220 --> 51:55.940
The nice thing is, is you just have too many good options now.

51:55.940 --> 51:57.980
Yeah, right, and Fedora is definitely one of them.

51:57.980 --> 51:58.980
All right.

51:58.980 --> 51:59.980
You want to take Adrian's?

51:59.980 --> 52:01.980
Adrian writes in, hello there, Chris and Wes.

52:01.980 --> 52:07.660
I've been a casual Linux user since 2005, but I've always used a Debian or Ubuntu-based

52:07.660 --> 52:08.660
distro.

52:08.660 --> 52:12.900
I've become familiar with apt and really not feeling up to learning a new package manager.

52:12.900 --> 52:15.980
Okay, maybe that's a bad excuse, I know.

52:15.980 --> 52:21.420
But lately, Ubuntu has been acting oddly on my current laptop, Firefox performance, blank

52:21.420 --> 52:25.860
screen after resuming from hibernation, other weird display problems.

52:25.860 --> 52:31.860
So I finally decided to give Fedora a spin last week, and I have not had any of the issues

52:31.860 --> 52:32.860
since.

52:32.860 --> 52:33.860
Huh.

52:33.860 --> 52:34.860
Displays are performing as expected.

52:34.860 --> 52:35.860
Suspend works great.

52:35.860 --> 52:40.620
And like you, I find the default setup fairly sparse, but also I like that I can slowly

52:40.620 --> 52:46.300
make the customizations that I want as I want them, and maybe figure out what, if any, extensions

52:46.300 --> 52:47.300
are causing me problems.

52:47.300 --> 52:51.460
I mean, that is it right there, right, is it's with Fedora, it's I kind of build it

52:51.460 --> 52:57.000
up to the desktop environment I want and with, and to a degree with Ubuntu stock, I kind

52:57.000 --> 52:59.380
of build it down a little bit, but I actually really like their default.

52:59.380 --> 53:04.300
So I almost feel like I need to channel my inner poppy here and say, you know, hang on,

53:04.300 --> 53:06.220
we need to be fair.

53:06.220 --> 53:09.140
All distros will exhibit problems after you've used them for a while.

53:09.140 --> 53:10.140
That's true.

53:10.140 --> 53:11.460
Fedora is not immune from this particular problem.

53:11.460 --> 53:12.460
Right.

53:12.460 --> 53:14.620
Well, you install a new setup while you get a new setup.

53:14.620 --> 53:18.580
But I also totally appreciate, you know, when you're of the opinion, like, I'd like to jump

53:18.580 --> 53:21.260
to something else, start fresh and just see what it's like, and there's absolutely nothing

53:21.260 --> 53:22.260
wrong with that.

53:22.260 --> 53:25.020
That's one of the great things we can do in Linux, and I think you're going to really

53:25.020 --> 53:26.020
enjoy it.

53:26.020 --> 53:31.460
So give it a spin, see what you think, and maybe report back after a little bit of usage,

53:31.460 --> 53:32.460
Adrian.

53:32.460 --> 53:33.460
I'd be curious to know how it goes.

53:33.460 --> 53:34.460
Yeah.

53:34.460 --> 53:35.460
Interesting theme there.

53:35.460 --> 53:36.460
And not planned.

53:36.460 --> 53:40.020
Stefan writes in, I know this is a question often asked and hard to answer.

53:40.020 --> 53:43.220
I've been a Linux user since the mid-90s with Slackware.

53:43.220 --> 53:47.500
I tried most of the distros at one time or another, and currently I'm running a Gentoo

53:47.500 --> 53:48.500
system.

53:48.500 --> 53:49.500
Oh, wow.

53:49.500 --> 53:53.700
The thing is, I'm kind of tired of having to compile everything.

53:53.700 --> 53:55.180
An honest Gentoo user.

53:55.180 --> 53:56.180
Yes.

53:56.180 --> 53:57.180
I know.

53:57.180 --> 53:58.180
That's how I felt, too.

53:58.180 --> 54:00.980
I'm kind of tired of having to compile everything for a little gain in speed.

54:00.980 --> 54:05.600
I switched to Gentoo from Angera, which was great, but wasn't a fan of the rolling updates.

54:05.600 --> 54:09.540
So I'd use Ubuntu, but I don't want to go back to a Debian-style system.

54:09.540 --> 54:15.140
I use my system to play Steam and good old, or, sorry, GOG games, some minor Python development,

54:15.140 --> 54:17.780
and every once in a while some C and C++.

54:17.780 --> 54:19.800
Also I use a lot of ham radio.

54:19.800 --> 54:24.500
So I've got some power to spare on this machine, and I've used that to dedicate that to Jellyfinner

54:24.500 --> 54:25.860
Plex I'm still deciding.

54:25.860 --> 54:27.380
I'm looking at the new and shining.

54:27.380 --> 54:30.380
I'm thinking maybe I should go with OpenSUSE or elementary these days.

54:30.380 --> 54:32.960
I'm kind of a fan of KDE5 Plasma.

54:32.960 --> 54:34.660
Are there any other distros you would suggest?

54:34.660 --> 54:35.660
Thanks for the help.

54:35.660 --> 54:37.340
Been a listener for many years on and off.

54:37.340 --> 54:38.340
Glad you're still around.

54:38.340 --> 54:39.340
Keep up the good work.

54:39.340 --> 54:41.100
Well, I'm glad you're still around, too, Stefan.

54:41.100 --> 54:44.140
I kind of feel like you should, I don't normally say this.

54:44.140 --> 54:45.140
Uh-oh.

54:45.140 --> 54:46.140
Going rogue.

54:46.140 --> 54:48.860
I think he should go OpenSUSE Plasma.

54:48.860 --> 54:49.860
You didn't think?

54:49.860 --> 54:50.860
No.

54:50.860 --> 54:51.860
You did not.

54:51.860 --> 54:53.860
I was just going to say you should try Fedora 33 since everyone else is loving it.

54:53.860 --> 54:54.860
Yeah.

54:54.860 --> 54:55.860
Okay.

54:55.860 --> 54:56.860
Keep going.

54:56.860 --> 54:57.860
Well, there is a Plasma spin of Fedora 33.

54:57.860 --> 54:58.860
Indeed.

54:58.860 --> 55:02.260
I think it's worth mentioning, you could totally give that a go, Stefan.

55:02.260 --> 55:03.260
Consider that.

55:03.260 --> 55:06.140
But, you know, he said in here that he's used Linux in Slackware.

55:06.140 --> 55:08.780
Put in his time.

55:08.780 --> 55:15.620
If you go over to OpenSUSE as a former Slackware user, you will, I think, notice some lineage

55:15.620 --> 55:16.620
there.

55:16.620 --> 55:18.220
I think there'll be some comfort there.

55:18.220 --> 55:20.100
And they have a killer Plasma release.

55:20.100 --> 55:21.700
And then I'm going to say this, too.

55:21.700 --> 55:26.980
If you have made Gen 2 work for you, then you're okay with a distro that does things

55:26.980 --> 55:28.420
a little differently.

55:28.420 --> 55:31.940
In OpenSUSE, it does things a little differently, but once you've used it for six months, you

55:31.940 --> 55:32.940
wrap your head around it.

55:32.940 --> 55:33.940
Yeah.

55:33.940 --> 55:36.860
And I think Stefan would be up for a challenge like that.

55:36.860 --> 55:41.140
And it really hits that sweet spot of you can get one that's semi-rolling, or you can

55:41.140 --> 55:44.060
get one that has stable releases, and you can pick and choose.

55:44.060 --> 55:45.980
So I think that would be a good candidate for you.

55:45.980 --> 55:50.360
All kinds of neat stuff with the open build service and really interesting technical foundations

55:50.360 --> 55:51.360
for sure.

55:51.360 --> 55:52.360
Absolutely.

55:52.360 --> 55:53.700
And, you know, I'm a big fan of elementary.

55:53.700 --> 55:59.380
I put it on my family's computers, but you have that Ubuntu base there, which you said

55:59.380 --> 56:02.380
earlier, not a big fan of the Debian bases.

56:02.380 --> 56:08.940
I think your options are to seriously consider OpenSUSE with Plasma, or maybe give the old

56:08.940 --> 56:13.500
Fedora Plasma spin a try, just for fun.

56:13.500 --> 56:18.940
I will talk about, you know, you mentioned Steam and GOG, and I don't have extensive

56:18.940 --> 56:24.260
OpenSUSE experience here, but I will say it has never been easier to get gaming going

56:24.260 --> 56:25.260
on Fedora.

56:25.260 --> 56:28.340
There is a flat pack that has a ton of the stuff you need for Steam.

56:28.340 --> 56:32.620
You can, with one click, add the NVIDIA driver repo now if you need in Software Center, and

56:32.620 --> 56:35.060
you have the latest and greatest NVIDIA driver.

56:35.060 --> 56:38.220
You get a very fresh and current kernel, which I know is also something you're interested

56:38.220 --> 56:39.220
in.

56:39.220 --> 56:41.020
So consider all of that, all those options.

56:41.020 --> 56:44.820
I don't know if the story is quite the same on OpenSUSE when it comes to gaming.

56:44.820 --> 56:46.780
Python development, you're going to be fine.

56:46.780 --> 56:48.020
Ham radio wise, you're going to be fine.

56:48.020 --> 56:50.940
Jellyfin or Plex, you're going to be fine either way.

56:50.940 --> 56:54.580
Maybe give Jellyfin a go though, and if Jellyfin doesn't work for you, then consider Plex.

56:54.580 --> 56:55.700
It's a good way to do it.

56:55.700 --> 56:59.060
If you're doing mostly just LAN streaming too, you probably don't need to worry about

56:59.060 --> 57:00.060
Plex.

57:00.060 --> 57:02.020
They also play decently together too.

57:02.020 --> 57:06.020
I have two going, and I point them at the same backing media storage on the file system,

57:06.020 --> 57:07.020
and that works great.

57:07.020 --> 57:10.540
Ah, a Westpane Media Pro tip right there.

57:10.540 --> 57:12.880
I want to thank our Unplugged Core contributors.

57:12.880 --> 57:17.580
You can become a member at unpluggedcore.com, become a core contributor to this show, and

57:17.580 --> 57:22.320
keep the show independent for as long as this show is on the air, but you also help reduce

57:22.320 --> 57:27.300
the ad load needed to make the show profitable, and we can be picky about who comes on, which

57:27.300 --> 57:31.540
is massive from a content creator standpoint, but you also get a couple of perks as a thank

57:31.540 --> 57:32.540
you.

57:32.540 --> 57:34.580
You get access to two feeds.

57:34.580 --> 57:36.220
I would probably just grab one of them.

57:36.220 --> 57:40.420
One is the limited ad version of the show, same full production with all of Joe's work

57:40.420 --> 57:42.340
gone into the mix and the edit.

57:42.340 --> 57:46.900
There's just limited ads in that one, or a second live feed, which is like the exact

57:46.900 --> 57:47.900
opposite.

57:47.900 --> 57:52.020
All our screw ups, the stuff that we would maybe have cut from the show for time before

57:52.020 --> 57:58.980
the mix, everything, full pre and post shows that happen well before we hit record in the

57:58.980 --> 58:03.820
main recorder, all of that is in a feed that's available to our members as well.

58:03.820 --> 58:07.680
And we also, and I don't normally say this, I should be though, because we work our butt

58:07.680 --> 58:13.700
off on this one, we try to get that full live feed out as soon as we can after the show.

58:13.700 --> 58:18.220
I mean, there's just limits in how fast you can encode and upload large files and it takes

58:18.220 --> 58:22.820
us a little bit to get the description written up, but usually within a half hour of us going

58:22.820 --> 58:29.180
off air, within that window of time, maybe an hour, the live full version is available.

58:29.180 --> 58:34.600
So if you like to get it as fresh as possible right after the show with no delay for editing

58:34.600 --> 58:35.600
and publishing.

58:35.600 --> 58:38.220
Or maybe I usually like to show up live, but you missed it.

58:38.220 --> 58:39.220
Yeah.

58:39.220 --> 58:40.220
Perfect.

58:40.220 --> 58:41.820
That's why we've made that feed available, because we're always talking about the live

58:41.820 --> 58:43.100
show in the main show.

58:43.100 --> 58:44.100
I mean, we're here live.

58:44.100 --> 58:45.100
Yeah.

58:45.100 --> 58:49.660
So we wanted to make that available to our core contributors as well, unpluggedcore.com.

58:49.660 --> 58:52.940
Now a pick this week, I told you about this one earlier, but I don't know if you had a

58:52.940 --> 58:56.340
chance to try it, Wes, because I just told you about it like two days ago.

58:56.340 --> 59:02.700
It's called Newsflash and you'll have to forgive the cliche term, but it is applicable.

59:02.700 --> 59:07.820
It is a quote, modern, end quote, feed reader designed for the GNOME desktop.

59:07.820 --> 59:08.820
It looks pretty nice.

59:08.820 --> 59:11.140
You know, I installed it this morning and I just opened it up right now.

59:11.140 --> 59:12.140
Yeah.

59:12.140 --> 59:13.140
Okay.

59:13.140 --> 59:14.140
So can you tell me a little bit more?

59:14.140 --> 59:17.100
So it says it's supposed to integrate with an existing feed reader service.

59:17.100 --> 59:18.780
What all can this actually do?

59:18.780 --> 59:24.060
So this is the probably most important feature for me in a desktop RSS feed reader.

59:24.060 --> 59:29.460
I consume tons and tons of feeds for the different shows, tons and tons of feeds.

59:29.460 --> 59:34.820
And I was way back in the day, I was a fresh RSS and a tiny, tiny RSS guy.

59:34.820 --> 59:37.140
And I even was a Google, Google Reader.

59:37.140 --> 59:38.140
Remember Google Reader guy?

59:38.140 --> 59:39.140
Yes.

59:39.140 --> 59:40.140
Yes.

59:40.140 --> 59:42.500
And I needed something more robust.

59:42.500 --> 59:46.360
And Feedly has actually added a lot of compelling features, including a bot that helps me sort

59:46.360 --> 59:48.460
news for various shows and whatnot.

59:48.460 --> 59:51.460
And they have a training algorithm where I can train it for the type of stories that

59:51.460 --> 59:52.460
I like.

59:52.460 --> 59:53.460
Figures out what you like.

59:53.460 --> 59:54.460
Yeah.

59:54.460 --> 59:57.060
And I can view in raw mode and filtered mode and all that kind of stuff that I just, for

59:57.060 --> 01:00:04.300
the amount of news that is consumed for this show, Linux action news and unfilter, I needed

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.300
a tool for it.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:10.180
And so I ended up using Feedly, but I never was really happy with Feedly being a web app.

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:13.980
I would like to have a desktop date of application, something I can sort of just leave open and

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:18.020
flip over to when I have a couple of minutes, something that maybe takes advantage of my

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:21.980
dark mode properly, integrates in with my GTK theme.

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:23.260
And that's where Newsflash came in.

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:24.820
As I hooked it up, there's several options.

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:28.820
Feedly is one of many options that you can connect it to for syncing, including some

01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:30.300
self-hosted solutions.

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:31.980
I hooked it up to my Feedly account.

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:36.740
I pulled down all of my feeds, and it has a functionality that I just, I really love.

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:42.100
And that is this situation where you get an article that only has maybe like an image

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:45.700
and the title and maybe a one-paragraph description of the story, and then you have to go to the

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:46.700
website for the rest.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:47.700
For the full thing.

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:48.700
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:52.060
Well, man, I'm trying to tear through stuff and read stuff and get an idea if the story

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:53.060
is good enough.

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:55.420
And I need more than just the headline if I'm going to make that call.

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:59.820
And this has a one-button click where it makes a best effort to go out to the website and

01:00:59.820 --> 01:01:04.460
get the rest of the content of the article, but it displays it in line like it was always

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:05.900
meant to be formatted for the feed.

01:01:05.900 --> 01:01:09.180
So it's a bit of a reader view that looks really good.

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:11.300
Oh, that's what this little book icon is.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:12.300
Right.

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:15.840
You hit that, and it'll go retrieve it for you and display it in line.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.840
And I just love that.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:22.100
And then, of course, it syncs back what you've read and whatnot and supports the latest GTK

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:23.100
design ideas.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:26.900
So all the latest menu standards and the CSD and all of that.

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:32.960
So it's a nice GNOME desktop app, and it's on Flathub, and I imagine it's other places

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:33.960
as well.

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.940
I wouldn't be surprised if this feels like maybe one of those things that was built for

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.820
maybe elementary OS maybe.

01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:40.820
I'm not sure.

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:41.820
I haven't looked in the...

01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:43.300
It is simple, clean, and functional.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.300
Yeah.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.560
And it's on Flathub, so it's just one click away.

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:50.340
So it's news flash, one word, and we'll have a link to that in the show notes.

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:52.020
So I'd like to hear your thoughts on it, Wes.

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:54.220
You give it a go for a little bit and let me know what you think.

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.420
Sounds like we've got some IRC folks using it too.

01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:57.420
Oh yeah?

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:58.420
Oh.

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:00.540
Linbo or LinMob, you've used it before?

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:03.700
Yes, I'm actively using it.

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.540
I'm using it with a self-hosted Miniflux instance.

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:12.100
Miniflux is one of those self-hostable RSS readers.

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:16.220
And I can report that news flash also works on the PinePhone.

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:17.220
Awesome.

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:19.900
And it's likely going to work on the Librem 5 too.

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.920
Oh, so it is designed to scale all the way down.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:23.920
That's so cool.

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:29.060
Oh man, we live in an interesting time for Linux users, I really have to say.

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:30.060
Cool.

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:31.060
Well, thanks for the direct report there.

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:33.460
I've been using it just for, I don't know, half a week.

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:34.460
I really like it.

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:37.820
And I still can use Feedly, you know, and everything's synced up, so I really appreciate

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:38.820
it.

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:39.820
I'll definitely give it a go.

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:41.780
You know, Wes, I encourage everyone to join us live.

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:46.140
We do this show at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern over at jblife.tv.

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:50.660
You can get that converted to your local time at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:52.060
See you next week.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:54.580
Same bad time, same bad station.

01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:58.080
Also check out our sponsor, A Cloud Guru, on social media.

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.780
Just find A Cloud Guru at YouTube, Twitter, or Facebook by going to any of those slash

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:03.940
A Cloud Guru and you'll find him on there.

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:04.940
Easy.

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:07.620
And I mentioned it earlier, but do check out Linux Action News if you haven't for a little

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.620
bit.

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:12.420
Wes has joined me now cooking up something really great for this week's episode.

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:14.700
And I don't know, I'm happy.

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.160
I'm really happy with the way it turned out.

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:20.140
We didn't really know because we had to kind of ask ourselves what we want to tweak about

01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:21.140
it.

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:22.140
But I'm really happy with what we landed on.

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:23.140
It's mostly the same.

01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:24.140
A little different.

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:25.140
Yeah.

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:26.140
Check it out.

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:27.620
It's linuxactionnews.com for that.

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:31.740
Links to everything we talked about, that's on our website at linuxunplugged slash 378

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.860
where you can also get subscribed.

01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:37.020
You can find the mumble room, the chat info.

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:40.460
All of that is linked up at the top of linuxunplugged.com.

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:43.340
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:58.780
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:28.540
Well, speaking of the virtual lug, I wanted to pick Mini-Mech's brain because last week

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:32.660
you mentioned to me that you were going to try recording the luplug.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:33.660
Did you give it a go?

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:34.660
How'd it turn out?

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:38.980
So Chris, honestly, I think we are really up into something here.

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:41.700
So we had our first recorded luplug session.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:47.100
What we technically do, in fact, in MumbleList, we create just a recording room and then go

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:50.680
in there and anyone who wants to record, records it.

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:55.180
So we have multiple copies of the recording and then someone prepares a topic.

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:56.960
In that case, it was me.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:02.240
We talked about shortcuts, mouse buttons and mouse gestures and then we had like a discussion

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:08.300
for about 45 minutes and then it was really, really, really, really cool.

01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:12.520
And now we were so happy about the result that we decided that we want to do that like

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:21.860
once a month and during our weekly meetings, we can discuss a topic and the one who proposed

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:27.620
a topic that is accepted by the others can prepare a talk and can also be host of the

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:31.000
topic in that recorded luplug session.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.020
So like we can earn ourselves a little podcast experience after listening to the master.

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:39.140
Now we can try ourselves, you see.

01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:45.380
Now we also have like people like Computer Kid that offered his help for editing.

01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:50.660
And the last question would be how we publish all these recordings, but we can talk about

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:51.660
that afterwards.

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:58.260
Because while we have recordings, we could do something like a monthly RSS feed and publish

01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:59.260
our recordings.

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:00.260
Yeah, totally.

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:06.100
Isn't that a great possibility for the JB community just to give you also some feedback

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:10.200
to participate and yeah, do some stuff.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.020
We are really up into something here.

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:13.540
I'm really happy.

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:14.540
That's really exciting.

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:17.060
I would, yeah, let's definitely talk more about like an RSS feed.

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:22.180
And you know, something I've always fantasized about is revamping the JB live FM stream to

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:27.460
have more community content on it and more current content when we're not actually live,

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:29.740
but programming to some degree.

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:33.300
That's always like when I have time for 20% project kind of thing.

01:06:33.300 --> 01:06:34.300
That's when I want to do that.

01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:36.980
But we could definitely set up an RSS feed a lot sooner than that.

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:39.860
So we'll start rubbing our brain noodles together on that one.

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.640
I bet we can figure something out.

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:43.940
Really kind of neat thing to watch it grow.

01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:44.940
That's really cool.

01:06:44.940 --> 01:07:03.940
That'll be powered by mumble.
