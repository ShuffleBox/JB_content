1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,540
You know you got your this is it. We got it. We'll do a moment in RV here on the live stream and

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,260
Emily's Emily's considering getting herself a fifth wheel RV now the fifth wheel RVs are big

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:15,020
They're like apartments because they don't have an engine and they don't have like the steering area so they can make extra living space out of

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,900
It there. They're a pretty sweet way to go. It's essentially like living in an apartment so obviously Emily

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm gonna say yeah, go for it

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,140
I like it a lot

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,660
We today was kind of an interesting day from an RV full-time or perspective because I'm about two hours out from the studio

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,220
I'm not even that far, but it's it's a long ways out from the studio

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,180
and there's a big storm today lots of wind the powers out and

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,300
It's funny when the when that happens in an RV

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,380
It's it's not like when the power goes out normally that because at first it's uh yeah, did the power just go out

12
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,180
Yeah, yeah

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:54,140
I think so because nothing really in the RV changes because you've got house batteries and some units even have generators so pretty quickly

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,600
It's just another day and today in particular is like that is really really handy now

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,100
The flip side is that I got outside, and I smelled something a little funny a

16
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,860
little a little stinky

17
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,860
kind of like rotten eggs I

18
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,460
Know immediately is propane and I start going home some dumb son of a bitch around here

19
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,020
They got their propane linking out of there out of their RV

20
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,380
But they're about to blow up their whole damn house those wait a minute. Is that me is that mean?

21
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,420
Couldn't be me could it I better to go double-check so I I walk over to my rig

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,700
This is my trucks already started

23
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,700
I'm about to leave to come into the studio, but I you know I'm like I better double-check this and I think it's just because

24
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,820
It was so windy is just sort of been waffling it around because I we sure enough had a leak

25
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,620
I opened up the bay where our propane tank was and I heard this little

26
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,460
No, and so I quickly turned off the propane valve to

27
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:51,300
To you know just solve the problem immediately and what must have happened is is we have an adapter on there that I think got

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,140
a little loose when we drove and

29
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,220
We just didn't really catch it because the wind hadn't really been blowing much

30
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,980
And so we you know possibly could have been blown up our home

31
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:04,080
So there's always that line just a slight danger nothing nothing terrible at the same time though

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,180
It's it's pretty great to be out somewhere where we are it's it's it's like stereotypical

33
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:15,880
Hollywood fall time road driving like if if they were gonna show a car driving down a fall road with all the beautiful colors

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,800
that's where we're at so it's neat to be able to go there for a few weeks spend some time there and then come back and

35
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,520
Get a little bit closer to work when we're done, so I say go for it Emily

36
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,620
I think more and more people are gonna be doing it. This is Linux unplugged episode

37
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,440
219 for October 17th

38
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:43,440
2017

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,200
Oh

40
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,240
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's reformatted and reinstalling every spare machine

41
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,200
It's got my name is Chris. My name is Wes or so I think because I've lost all my documents

42
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,120
Oh, no. Well, hello Wes and over there is beard. Hello beard. So guys

43
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,780
This is an episode you could say

44
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,600
I'm a bit pumped up about bit pumped up. This is one of those episodes

45
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,920
That reminds me why I got into podcasting. I am very much looking forward today's episode

46
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:19,520
We're going to review Ubuntu 1710 in just a little bit in the show and we're also gonna cover some rather

47
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,920
Important community news this week that we're gonna break it down as they say that's what we say

48
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,080
I'll break it down. We're gonna analyze and break it down. Yeah, we'll get through some of the community news and events that we

49
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,800
Want to talk about including some projects. We just recently covered that needs some help and

50
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,920
then

51
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,560
1710s here now, even if you're not an Ubuntu user

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,040
I encourage you to stick around for the review coming up in the show

53
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,560
In fact, I you more than smart maybe more than anybody else. I challenge you. You're a long time an anti Ubuntu

54
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,000
White, is that it? Is that a thing? It is now an anti Ubuntu er, I don't know. But if you're one anti Ubuntu, I don't know

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,400
Yeah, it's a hard one. I asked I asked for you to stick around for a bit

56
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,720
And if you're considering the upgrade debating it, I also encourage you to stick around

57
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,360
obviously, I had a lot of hands-on with 1710 at

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,960
the Ubuntu rally

59
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,920
We've been running it here for days. I've been running it for weeks and weeks

60
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,920
And so this is one of those reviews that we get to do rarely and I'm really looking forward to doing that

61
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,040
But we got to get to some of this news. This is big big new stuff big new stuff

62
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,720
So let's holla at our virtual lug time appropriate greetings mama room

63
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
Hello

64
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,680
Hello, that was nice and concise Wow

65
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,160
Top of it. Yeah, they like gotten a cue. Yeah, they took turns

66
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,400
No, I want to say right here at the top of the show next week as an experiment

67
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,760
I think we're gonna try doing discord just so we can do an AB and let the audience decide what they thought worked better

68
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:50,640
So if you'd like to help us participate in that test go to discord.me slash Jupiter colony to join our discord

69
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,080
You can use the web browser discord app or you can download their electron app

70
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,160
And I guess there's a snap of it and there's probably other ways you can get about it

71
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,840
Anyways, we're gonna do it a little AB and we'll let the audience and the audience being both the participators and the listeners decide which

72
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,480
Worked better. So join us for 220 in discord next week virtual lug. We're not switching. We're just testing for one episode

73
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,480
starting with

74
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,840
221 we'll be back in mumble until we make a decision. So we're not switching. We're just trying for 220 in discord

75
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,320
I'm installing the snap right now. Oh, yeah, that's right

76
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,080
So yeah

77
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,920
Give it a go on that and I'm gonna see you know

78
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,560
And the other thing I have to consider too is like guess because we bring guests in via mumble and all that stuff

79
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,480
I'll say my bias is to stick with mumble right off the top. That's my bias because it's worked for us. It's free

80
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,440
It's open source and it's part of the show. That's my bias, but we're gonna give it a good AB. See what how it goes

81
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,400
okay, so let's start with a news story that's kind of a big one that is

82
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:52,960
Complicated and it's this new enforcement statement around the Linux kernel Greg KH Chris Masson

83
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,000
Rick van rail

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,060
I want to say and Sean Khan all got together and wrote up a big old post about this new signing statement

85
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,200
Essentially that's going to be attached to the Linux kernel

86
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,680
But I wanted to start with a little bit of information

87
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:13,720
That's kind of kind of interesting Greg has talked about this every single year that the the kernel continues to change faster than it did

88
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,880
the year before

89
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,140
Which is nuts since it's 26 years old now

90
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
so this year

91
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,760
This year they're running around eight point five changes an hour

92
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
10,000 lines of code added

93
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,560
2000 modified

94
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,100
2500 lines removed every hour of every day Wow

95
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:39,060
Those numbers are just insane. Yeah, and so there's been a problem going on in the background. You're familiar with netfilter

96
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,060
I am and there's been

97
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:48,140
Some shenanigans as a result of the developer of a developer from netfilter

98
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,020
Patrick McCarty and it's causes the kernel developers to rethink

99
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,260
aspects of the kernel license

100
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,820
Now we're not going gpl3 here, but stick with me for a second BST MIT

101
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:07,300
Apache what's happening Chris so Greg and others right the same processes that we use to assure fulfillment quote-unquote of license

102
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,460
Obligations, you know to make sure that companies that are violating the GPL come into compliance

103
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:21,660
The same obligations and availability of source code all of those can be used to unjustly troll active in unjustly trolling activities to extract

104
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,340
personal monetary rewards from GPL software

105
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:31,620
The kernel team appears to call it monetization for short these they're trying to monetize their code in

106
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:39,460
Particular issues have arisen as a developer from the netfilter community Patrick McCarty has sought to enforce his copyright claims in secret and

107
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,580
for large sums of money by threatening or

108
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,980
engaging in litigation

109
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,780
Some of his compliance claims are issues that could easily be resolved however

110
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:56,020
He has also made claims based around ambiguities in the GPL, too

111
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,140
That no one in our community had ever considered part of compliance to begin with so here's an example

112
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:05,480
This is really something examples of these claims have been distributing over-the-air firmware

113
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,500
Requiring a cell phone maker to deliver a paper copy of the source code offered letter

114
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:16,420
claiming that the source code server must be set up with a download speed as fast as a as the binary server based on the

115
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,660
Equivalent access language of section 3 ie he's trying to take section 3 language of the GPL

116
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,580
That that talks about equivalent access and apply that to download speeds

117
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,980
And if you don't if you are in violation of that then he's going after you

118
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,000
He's also saying that it mandates that paper copies of the GPL be distributed that it gets that it gets

119
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,060
Translated to other languages and if you fail to do any of these things you're out of compliance and because of the way the GPL

120
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,860
To a structured he demands immediate action and if you fail to take immediate action

121
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:50,060
Then he gets to claim damages at some insane amount for the and for the amount of time that you don't make these corrections

122
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,680
He gets to claim damages, then he goes after you for those damages

123
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,960
Because of this and help clarify with the majority of the Linux community members feels a correct way to enforce their license

124
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:05,060
the technical advisory board of the Linux Foundation has worked together with lawyers in the community and

125
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,940
individual developers and many companies to participate in the development and now rely on

126
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,660
The draft of the kernel enforcement statement to help address both the specific issue

127
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,460
They're facing today and to help prevent any future issues like this from happening again

128
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:26,060
Now it adopts some termination provisions that are from the GPL 3 and essentially layers it down on top

129
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,060
And isn't re-licensing because what it what it essentially is is it's an agreement

130
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,540
And it's a statement that says the copyright holders of this kernel code

131
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:42,060
Interpret this clause this way. This is our collective understanding of this line of the GPL 2

132
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:49,860
And as a result we also now assume these additional new things and these new things are

133
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:56,660
The additional permissions given to companies that have confidence of the copyright holder to reach compliance

134
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,260
So you're you're essentially allowing people time to reach compliance

135
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:07,060
And they hope this will re-establish user slash business confidence and help direct enforcement activity back to the original purpose

136
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,860
Which is actual compliance and not screwing people for?

137
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,660
Failing to get the right download speed and then suing them for damages when they haven't corrected immediately

138
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,060
by

139
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,260
bastardizing language from the GPL 2 to use as a hammer so they're lacquering on top of

140
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,660
Agreements that the the stakeholders of the Linux community

141
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,460
Kernel have agreed upon it's really complicated

142
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,860
But because essentially the top developers hold the bulk of the kernel code copyright

143
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,460
As long as you get this top tier group of developers to agree to this

144
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:46,260
New layer this enforcement statement then essentially you have something that is law in a way because

145
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,460
By making it very clear how the project interprets that legal ease

146
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:57,460
That means you are accepting their interpretation when you now use the project and so you can't come after them afterwards pretending like you didn't know

147
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:01,660
That's my rough non-lawyer understanding of this. It's very complicated

148
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,860
Well, it's the law

149
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,460
If you want to know more or think I got something wrong

150
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,060
Please feel free to let me know and also linked in the show notes. I have

151
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:20,460
A fact that Greg KH has posted. I have more information about Patrick McHardy and his copyright profiteering

152
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:27,260
That many developers in the Linux community have been worried about this is something that's been brewing in the background for ages now and

153
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,060
apparently

154
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,860
Software Conservancy is all in with this statement

155
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,860
They have they have a press release. It says they applaud the Linux community's promotion of principle

156
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:44,060
principled copier left enforcement and they say the soft the statement includes additional permissions under the Linux license

157
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:51,260
Which is GPL 2 so they agree this does not change the kernel from GPL 2 to GPL 3 and they applaud this new statement

158
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:57,260
So there you go. Yeah, apparently Greg Greg says at some point more than like 200 kernel developers

159
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,860
Discussed the complexities of a problem. That's a yeah to come to that

160
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:08,060
Well, it seems like it was a good a good decision. I can certainly see why the Linux Foundation be concerned and why people be concerned about the

161
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:14,260
You know lack of assurity that businesses would have when trying to use it and obviously that's a big goal to keep businesses invested in Linux

162
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,660
Yeah, and now let's talk about the other really kind of big story this week

163
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:24,260
So that's the probably the biggest and it's hard to really break it all down and it's for desktop users

164
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,860
It really has no big

165
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:32,060
Impact either way, not really. Yeah, but this one has more of an impact on desktop users. You guys probably all know about crack at this point

166
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,860
k-r-a-c-k

167
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,860
crack is whack WPA 2 is broken now and

168
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:43,660
You guys just got done covering this on tech snaps. That's not a good spot to to point people's tech snap and also ask Noah this week

169
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:50,060
Both have really good coverage on the on this problem. So it's not really our domain necessarily the Linux distribution

170
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,660
Are good at putting out the patches man, but boy they sure talking about Android and Linux a lot in the reviews

171
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:02,060
Yeah, there's a lot of other systems and OS is that I mean and and maybe some of that is for good reason about like

172
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,660
Well, you know Windows already has a patch for instance, but some of our Android phones will not see those patches

173
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:13,060
But if you're not explicit about it, that's just kind of confusing. Mm-hmm dance here from elementary. I'm Dan

174
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,060
I'm curious if you have any like

175
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:21,860
Any any insights to share from the well there? Well, that's some timing well on the distribution side of pushing the patch

176
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,460
Is that pretty smooth for you guys? Is it is it something where somebody?

177
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,860
Somebody sits up in the elementary team and says, okay. Let's make sure this one goes out or how does that process work for you guys?

178
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,060
Actually for us, it's completely transparent because we're based on Ubuntu

179
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:40,260
We just get it directly from canonical security team like everybody else. Yeah, I figured that out

180
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:46,260
Probably be the case Dan and then they got it out pretty quick a lot of the distributions did Linux really kicked butt on this particular one

181
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,860
People will people notice too, which is really cool. This is a lot of times

182
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,660
We're right on top of the patches, but people just take it for granted

183
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:58,260
But because this one got so much publicity and it affects desktop users to people notice this update coming down

184
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,260
Then you saw some real hustle. That was cool. All right. Well, thanks for the insight there damn

185
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,260
I I got to say

186
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:11,260
We have been fighting some problems here in the studio for four weeks again. We have these these frequent now

187
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:17,260
Gnome 3 crashes and what seems to happen is gnome takes a crash and then when gnome crashes

188
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:25,260
It seems to crash our audio server which then we lose about 25 seconds 30 seconds of audio on our live stream and in our episode

189
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,260
recordings

190
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,260
No, this is not deja vu. Yes. We've talked about this before

191
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:36,260
We actually had it resolved for a while for weeks and weeks and weeks. We resolved it with with really no

192
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,260
No complaints like beard fixed a few things did a couple of updates and put a new Nvidia driver on there

193
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,260
I can't remember what you what was it? What was it? It wasn't anything that complicated. It was basics

194
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,260
I basically just updated the drivers and sell the new Nvidia driver and it went away

195
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:55,260
Yeah, and so we thought okay, we're good. We can we can we can proceed on sanity and we have the LTS kernel

196
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,260
So yes, it's arch, but we have the LTS kernel. Yeah, right. So we thought okay, we're good. We're good without changing

197
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,260
We haven't done any updates because it's working and it's only been you know a few weeks

198
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,260
Without changing anything and only just a handful of reboots now all of a sudden gnome threes begun crashing again on us

199
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,260
There's not really anything of any detail in the log. It's it's

200
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,260
It's one of those things where I think by the end of next week. I'm gonna reload this machine

201
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,260
It's just got a half an hour to go

202
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,260
And I've been waiting to see I've been waiting to see which way am I gonna go? Where's it gonna break?

203
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,260
What am I gonna do? Do I go solace? Do I go fedora? Do I go Ubuntu?

204
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,260
Do I go arch again with the LTS the kernel and the LTS drivers?

205
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,260
So that's gonna be part of what we talked about today

206
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,260
Because it's it's in the background. It is a brood as they say

207
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,260
But first I want to thank Linux Academy before we go much further in the show Linux academy.com slash unplug

208
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:52,260
That's where you go to sign up for a free seven-day trial and support the show. It's a platform to learn more about Linux

209
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,260
And they have really nice hands-on scenario based labs to give you experience on real servers

210
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:02,260
They have self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux and cloud and DevOps topic

211
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,260
And if you get stuck anywhere, they have real humans instructors full-time humans

212
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,260
They can help you one of the things that's really nice about Linux Academy is their course scheduler

213
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:18,260
If you're busy you got kids you got a job you got a lot going on. Maybe you're like West you live in downtown Seattle

214
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,260
So you're always busy and that's true, right? That's right

215
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,260
Yeah, but I still got to learn things course scheduler West you pick a course

216
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:28,260
You set a time frame and it just helps you stick to it gives you friendly reminders

217
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,260
If you want them about your goals, I was looking in here just yesterday for

218
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,260
Getting started on Android development six hours and 40 minutes or something like that

219
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:42,260
And you get started on Android development breaks it all down. I like to think I'm pretty good at unstructured learning

220
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,260
Figuring stuff out for myself, but I don't know how long that's gonna take

221
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:50,260
Even if you have a good note sheet to use like Linux Academy makes it so easy back

222
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:55,260
Okay, I have two hours right now because my plans fell through I'm going to learn something concrete

223
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,260
Yeah, and they have offline stuff

224
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,260
You can take with you to learn on the go

225
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:03,260
Including iOS and Android apps and those video courses check it out Linux Academy comm slash

226
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,260
Unplugged it's a platform to learn more about Linux Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and a big

227
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,260
Thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplug program. I

228
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:16,260
Want to do a quick little mention for the Linux vendor firmware project

229
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,260
We talked about FW update last week. What a fantastic project

230
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:25,260
That is got to version 1 0 lets you update your firmwares on your Linux's now. Here's the problem

231
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,260
They're looking a little low on funds right now

232
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:33,260
And you would think that like Dell and HP and these companies would pay them, but no that's not how these things work

233
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:39,260
Unfortunately, and so there's some hosting costs here, and I really feel like these guys are an undersold

234
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,260
Asset to the community and they are asking for humble things

235
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:49,260
They say at the moment the secure part of the Linux vendor firmware project is hosted on a dedicated scale-away instance

236
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,260
So any additional donations would be spent on paying this small bill and putting it on the table

237
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:59,260
So any additional donations would be spent on paying this small bill and perhaps more importantly buying some secondhand

238
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,260
Hardware to include as part of our release QA checks

239
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:10,260
Now if this was a business that delivered if Linux if Linux was a business that delivered firmware updates to its customers

240
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:16,260
They wouldn't be scrapping together a couple of thousand dollars right and buying secondhand hardware

241
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:23,260
And this is some this is one of the unsung hero aspects of open sources often this stuff is being done on budgets that

242
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:31,260
Are inconceivable to multinational companies and I would I would be wonderful if this was not a project

243
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:37,260
That was hurting for time and resources and money if they could pay for developers if they could pay for hosting

244
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:43,260
I really think that would be a good use of people's time and money if you want to donate they accept payments via

245
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:51,260
Libra pay or PayPal they have details on their website which we have linked in the show notes just such a such a great

246
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:57,260
Project you know getting getting your firmware updates out there like your microcode updates and your all the other stuff out there

247
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:02,260
Yeah that was previously you had to boot into some crazy free DOS or load up your windows system

248
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:08,260
Just and hope that you don't brick everything and it's still early days too so you have more that needs to be done

249
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,260
We have more work that needs to be done still so help them get there

250
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:19,260
He's got some work on his hands I struggle to understand this completely but it is essentially a compatibility layer for steam

251
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:26,260
That could work across all distributions using snaps and a new feature of snap 2.28 called bases which allow you to create a soulless

252
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:34,260
Base snap whoa take that in for a second a soulless base snap so he can create an environment based on the soulless base snap

253
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,260
That you could put on an Ubuntu bugs and a fedora bugs and energy bugs you know I'm saying I want that right now

254
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:46,260
Yeah it's kind of a neat feature and I guess technically everything right now is just sort of based on like a core snap

255
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:52,260
Everything's dependent on a core snap which is like base Ubuntu system but it could be a fedora or soulless right it doesn't matter

256
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:58,260
So Ike is using this newfangled base technology to create this Linux steam integration layer

257
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:05,260
That is basically a replacement for the runtime stuff that's done now with steam in theory

258
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:11,260
So we could all get access to all the hard work they've done over in the soulless world of having that top-notch steam runtime

259
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:17,260
The core thing you're you know I know we won't talk about this much but the the core thing you're trying to get out of this

260
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:26,260
Is you have a lot of good hard work that's gone into libraries and drivers and all this stuff that Ubuntu 12.04

261
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:32,260
Simply does not have because it's from 2012 think about that that's a long time ago

262
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:38,260
Great year that it was right be it in the past but that is what the steam runtime is based on

263
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:46,260
And that's why early on Ike was trying to solve this problem with the little menu

264
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:51,260
But it's a little menu that comes up and it asks you to choose native libraries or steam libraries

265
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:56,260
It's like the steam integration chooser or whatever and that was the first that's the first attempt at this

266
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,260
This is like the final attempt at solving this problem and it solves it for all distributions too

267
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,260
They talk about it more in the most recent late night Linux if you want to hear Ike talk about it

268
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:09,260
Because he could explain about it and I could but I would love to see it as somebody who jumps distros

269
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:14,260
That's really you know where I find this to be interesting is it would allow me to distro hop but still have the same consistent steam experience

270
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,260
Right

271
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,260
And this is how they're gonna do it they're gonna have to target these these bases like this

272
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:27,260
But it's really also nice to see like that snap functionality really coming along because like snap has come a long way as a format

273
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:33,260
And as just like the tooling is available that now that seems totally reasonable and maybe in the future it'll be

274
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,260
You know once we have snap on more distributions or at least more like in the defaults

275
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:43,260
Telling people how to start gaming on Linux should be really easy and we can be confident that it'll just work

276
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:50,260
So Dan I've seen I've seen a recent insight post over at canonical about elementary working with snap packages

277
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,260
But I've also seen the elementary Twitter account say you guys are also excited about flat pack

278
00:21:54,260 --> 00:22:01,260
So what's going on? What's going on over at elementary with snaps and flat packs and future integration of stamps?

279
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,260
What's where's all that at at least right now?

280
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:11,260
I mean, I think overall the consensus is that it's early days on kind of both of these projects

281
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:16,260
And there's a lot of people doing really interesting things to kind of push it forward and get ready to start shipping it

282
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,260
I know that Martin's working on

283
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:25,260
Distributing snaps in Ubuntu matei, but for us when when we're

284
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:30,260
When we're looking to adopt a new technology or change kind of the way that we do things

285
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,260
Like we subscribe to this idea of having a one true development path

286
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:40,260
And so we want to make sure that if we pick a technology and say, hey, we like this and we're going to go with this

287
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:45,260
That we've tested it really thoroughly and that it works for like everything across the board

288
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:50,260
And that it's something that we can tell our third party developer community that it works right now for them to use

289
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:59,260
So we're still trying to like explore and we're totally happy to like attend events and work with the upstream

290
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:05,260
Feel like there's some political waters though. You have to navigate a bit like you don't want to upset different camps basically

291
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:12,260
Yeah, I mean, there's some politics, but there's also some like brand management to it as well

292
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:20,260
Like, you know, I had third party developers messaging me after the canonical blog post

293
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:24,260
Asking like, hey, you know, do I need to start getting my apps ready for snaps?

294
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:29,260
You know, so they're expecting more communication from from us on that

295
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,260
And, you know, it's kind of like, hey, you know, no, not yet. We're still looking into it

296
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,260
Yeah, it's of course, you know, like we it's like a big topic right now

297
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:45,260
But it feels like it's got another nine months at least before like it really like we're giving it the

298
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:50,260
It's good that we're talking about it, but I think it gets probably more discussion than it totally warrants

299
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,260
But it's one of those things. It's this is what's here. It's happening now

300
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,260
So I guess that's what we're talking about, right?

301
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,260
And this this thing that Ike is doing this Linux steam integration project

302
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:04,260
This looks like it could solve real problems for different distributions down

303
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,260
I mean, I know it's it's using a solace base, but if this really worked and it became

304
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:15,260
Sort of a ubiquitous way to get steam working across distributions. Would it be something you guys would take a look at?

305
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:23,260
I mean, I definitely think that for certain third-party packages that being able to do these kind of things are super important

306
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:30,260
Like like you said steam targets, you know 1204 right and and they're never going to build a version of steam for elementary OS

307
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:37,260
So there's always gonna have to be like a side loading story and it seems like container formats like snap are the best

308
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:45,260
Side loading story that that we could have going forward. Yeah, and it it also solves that that well, there's no applications available problem

309
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:49,260
Well, that's not really true. You know once you start getting a couple of these things in in container formats

310
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,260
And you start you start making targets like this like this Linux team integration target

311
00:24:54,260 --> 00:25:01,260
Yeah, it starts changing because then you start targeting these you can start targeting these base snaps instead of targeting distributions

312
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,260
Right and that could have big ramifications on the availability of applications

313
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,260
And look at Ike here, you know, he's he's not holding I give him credit here. He's not holding this in just for solace

314
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,260
Yeah, right. I mean that's kind of a big selling point for solace, but now you can get it anywhere

315
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:19,260
Mm-hmm. So anyways, we'll follow it with some interest. I'll probably kick the tires you have thoughts beer

316
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:27,260
I just find it interesting that everybody's talking about snaps and flat packs and app image is just like been pushed off to the side

317
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:35,260
I mean, you know what the thing about app images is that it only kind of solves cross-platform

318
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:41,260
But it like what's really important is all the security and privacy features that come with like containerized formats. Yeah

319
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,260
Yeah, the sandboxing is kind of a nice feature

320
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:49,260
Yeah, definitely and it's it's like when I when I first thought of application sandboxing

321
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:54,260
I thought about how Apple did it on the Mac and it's not like that. It's it's it's much better and it's it makes sense

322
00:25:54,260 --> 00:26:00,260
It keeps especially especially if in business environments where you can have business applications that can take decades between updates

323
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,260
I just really like it

324
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:07,260
It's gonna make it's gonna make deploying applications that would sometimes be harder to deploy on newer versions of Linux

325
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:13,260
Possible in business environments. I ran into that myself personally where you had to load a really old version of Linux

326
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:19,260
Yeah, right to get an application to work and I think that's gonna start changing finally

327
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,260
So I guess it is I guess it is relevant to be talking about I was especially with all the like the you know

328
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:28,260
The security minded support and other ways to secure snaps like I can already think of multiple ways

329
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:33,260
We're like, okay. Well, I really need to run this Ubuntu 10 software. I don't trust it. It's really old

330
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:39,260
I can't change it but a snap is just like that would and then I can secure the 16 workstation or 17 with my standard tooling

331
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:45,260
Yeah, and we're using them to you know, we have a snap for the soundboard. There's a snap for discord. Yeah

332
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:52,260
It's happening. It's happening. Oh my gosh, you know, I think what it is is I'm just really pumped to talk about Ubuntu 1710

333
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,260
So I'm like, let's get through all the news. Let's get through the news so we can talk about 1710 because that's what I'm here to do today

334
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,260
That's right. Yeah, you're so giddy

335
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:05,260
It's literally why I came into work today. It's like I get to talk about seven first thing out of your out of your mouth

336
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:10,260
Bum too. Yeah, so let's let's clear the way you see what else we have

337
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,260
We have a couple other things but um, I'm gonna bump them. What?

338
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:18,260
Well, we're gonna bump them. I can't hold my breath much longer

339
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:23,260
DigitalOcean.com go over there create an account and then apply our promo code do unplugged

340
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:29,260
It's one word do unplugged gives you a $10 credit now you hang on to that $10 credit because buckle up

341
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:35,260
DigitalOcean is a simple way to get started with really fast systems in seconds

342
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:41,260
Everything's SSD from the $5 a month system to the ones that have unbelievable gigs of RAM

343
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,260
Yeah, gigs of RAM have a simple intuitive API if you like doing it that way

344
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,260
I know we do and they have a dashboard for days

345
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:53,260
It's it's if they had dashboard awards this thing would be an award winner. They should have dashboard awards

346
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,260
They really should. Oh my gosh, like can we can we do that?

347
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:01,260
Service provider dashboard awards. Screw the dashboard. Tell me about spaces. Oh

348
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:07,260
Beardsley the spaces. I wasn't sure what it was gonna be like I've been impressed with a lot of the features that

349
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,260
DigitalOcean has rolled out over the years. But you were a little skeptical. I just didn't think it was gonna be for me

350
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,260
You were like what am I gonna do with these objects? I didn't think it was gonna be for me. I really didn't

351
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,260
I thought okay great for you developers

352
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,260
Great for you

353
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:23,260
It's so great though for me because if you just want to use their did I mention their wonderful dashboard

354
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:29,260
If you just want to use their great dashboard, you can go in there and just drop some files in there generate a link and

355
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:35,260
Have it destroy within like say, I don't know a day and then give people a link and then it will download wherever they're at

356
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,260
At as fast as their freaking connection can take it. It is so great

357
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:43,260
I I had I was pulling down files at 10 megabytes a second and I'm like, all right

358
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,260
This is I know that's the max this connection amount is gonna be able to pull that down

359
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,260
They're ideal for storing static or unstructured data like audio and video

360
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,760
So if you're working on podcasts and you want to send the files around to your co-host, it's perfect for that

361
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:03,020
Images also text all that. It's it's it's really well done. And of course, it's all programmical like magical

362
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:07,760
What's the term for that? It's Dev a medical, you know with that API you could step a medical

363
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,860
You don't even have to use it. I think it's just good. Oh

364
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,620
But I want to make a new word

365
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:17,820
digital ocean comm use our promo code do unplug then you can spin up like their five dollar a month rig run it two

366
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:23,760
months for free and just try it out if you want to try out Linux on a server free BSD or play around with spaces

367
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:29,760
Digital ocean comm use our promo code do unplugged and a big. Thank you digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program

368
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,500
How's it going over there West?

369
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,820
Pretty good. So before we started the show West had to recover his bootloader. Yeah, it's actually I haven't bothered to fix it yet

370
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:43,020
I just I just K exact from my other installation because that's like just the easiest way for me to do things now

371
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,540
I don't know what the state of my life is like. I love it

372
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,100
so you nuked your bootloader trying out of into seventeen ten did and

373
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,540
Are you in seventeen ten? Yeah, of course

374
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,340
It's seventeen ten episode day Chris. Come on. I know and you use gnome right using no I sure am

375
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:03,180
Yeah, actually it it crashed on me while you were doing that ad read. So that's the theme of the day

376
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:10,420
Oh, no, no, no. No. Oh, no. Oh, no. I know I appreciate your support the hug here. It's great

377
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,540
Oh, I just well have you actually feel bad for me

378
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:18,120
But I so let's so let's talk about Ubuntu 1710 because this is a pretty remarkable release

379
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,080
Even if you're not an Ubuntu user and as you're listening to this

380
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:26,020
It's within hours of download if well if you're listening to this when this episodes released

381
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:32,100
It's within hours of release and download Ubuntu 1710. The ISOs are final. They're done. They're baked and

382
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,080
It is it's a notable release

383
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,440
For the obvious reason which is this is canonicals first released back on gnome

384
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,960
But I think it's also a notable release for another

385
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:53,440
major reason that we aren't talking about as much and that's the meta story around this release and that is the fact that this

386
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,440
is the first release after a

387
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,760
significantly dramatic restructuring at canonical that saw the layoff of hundreds of employees and

388
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,160
saw a complete refocusing of the company and

389
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:10,520
and during the midst of all of that this was being free software kept going and

390
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:18,580
I think that's a pretty that's a particularly remarkable achievement because I have seen that type of restructuring and thinning of the herd

391
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,660
Completely derail a company for years even even into oblivion

392
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:28,300
So some some companies never even make it through that so it's kind of remarkable that they also are shipping on time

393
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,420
With a product that well, we have we're very excited to talk about so

394
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,420
That's the meta story

395
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:41,940
I think around this release and then the other the other big meta story about this release was when mark announced all of these changes

396
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,140
and the grandfathering of or the sunsetting I guess of

397
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,900
unity 7

398
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,540
The screenshots that got passed around and the general sentiment that got passed around

399
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:59,820
Was it was going to be a basic bitch gnome implementation. It was going to be stock gnome and

400
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:05,500
And there was no there was no Ubuntu soul. There was no heart. They were getting out of that game

401
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:11,500
They weren't making a desktop anymore. I'm sure you'll have one but everybody everybody it was a skew is that everybody knows the screenshot

402
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:15,660
I'm thinking of with the green gnome background and the Edwardia gray theme

403
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:23,100
Default that was that was the image that went around on the stories everywhere and the character of Ubuntu was gone and

404
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,180
the of course the alternative would have been

405
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,800
or

406
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:33,260
They really muck this thing up and they make it like some crazy gnome fork

407
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,580
To make it like unity 7 so we don't want that either

408
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,420
so it seemed like there was two routes in front of us and neither one of them were any good and

409
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,780
And people assume that Ubuntu is out of the desktop game

410
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,380
Now here we are six months later and

411
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:56,220
This thing definitely has the soul of Ubuntu if you just look at the screenshots, you know, this is an Ubuntu system

412
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,480
And I have heard multiple different users now who sat down for the first time

413
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,180
Both of them that I'm thinking of actually

414
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:10,620
Or plasma users and and Beardsley over here. Yep. So when they said like though, this is unity. This is unity

415
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,900
It feels like it from the yeah

416
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:19,700
It's uh, it's pretty remarkable that they they got here and they did it in a way that didn't piss off upstream that

417
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,720
listened to the feedback of the community and as a result in a project that is

418
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,880
significantly different than any release we've seen from Ubuntu in ages

419
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,640
Significantly, we've never seen an Ubuntu release like this in in modern Ubuntu releases

420
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:42,980
It's a new era is what it feels like. It is definitely a new era and it's also right before their next major LTS. Yeah

421
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:49,200
So it's it is the release to work this stuff out because the next LTS has got to be pretty rock-solid

422
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,600
So it's it's it's a hell of a release to review and and sure enough if it's not the kind of thing that

423
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:00,320
legitimately gets me up in the morning makes me want a podcast because even if you're not an Ubuntu user there's a lot here to

424
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:08,160
Take in and to appreciate and so I wanted to start with you guys to just start talking about our impressions of Ubuntu 1710

425
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,920
I'm coming at it from somebody who's been watching the development very closely

426
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,640
From day one and so in in such I have lost a little bit of the wow. Look at this in its totality

427
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:24,120
Because I've sort of been there as each step has come along. Well, you've also literally traveled across the country to

428
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,880
Witness some of that development. Yeah, that's that yeah, there's that too

429
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,160
So I'll tell you I guess what I what I I would start with just to sort of kick it off is

430
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,480
The dock that they have decided to implement in this is where we need to start because this

431
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:50,240
This was the necessary piece if you remove this from this gnome setup. This doesn't really feel much like an Ubuntu setup

432
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,240
if you take especially if you change the background and

433
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,160
They did it in a very sort of a polite upstream way that seems to be working

434
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,520
well and having gone to the Ubuntu rally I

435
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,480
watched firsthand why it's sort of important that they own this piece of the desktop for themselves and

436
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:14,240
in the in the last post Ubuntu gnome shell and artful day 15 did rocks talks a little bit about the

437
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,360
Quick fix that they had in the rally around their dock

438
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,360
This simple sort sort of

439
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,560
Mild fork I think is going to be an area they can continue to work on and

440
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,360
Really kind of just be a small thing they add to their desktop that makes it stand out

441
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,180
Without having to really own this huge complex code base

442
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,740
and

443
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,140
it I think was such it's such a critical thing that they actually do own this piece themselves and

444
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,460
They have they've done that they've done that part right the other thing. I like as a gnome desktop user

445
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,420
Is I like that?

446
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:54,740
I'm finally able to install a version of Ubuntu and I get the most recent version of gnome gnome

447
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:00,580
3.2 6.1 is shipping in 1710 and this is not a

448
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,580
Luxury that Ubuntu users have had very often

449
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,940
Generally, you got to go to your fedoras or your arches your seusses for that

450
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:14,140
Yeah, right exactly or you were installing like something yourself from maybe some other PPA or weird repo

451
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,920
But you didn't it wasn't just there for you. Yeah. Yeah

452
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:23,740
And these things for me are like really ticking boxes for me. I like that. I like they're I like they're nice minimal dock implementation

453
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:28,940
Mm-hmm. I really unobtrusive. It's not in the way. Yeah. Yeah, so what do you thoughts?

454
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,060
I've talked a lot now West I got more to say but I want to give you a chance to jump in

455
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:36,760
What do you what do you thoughts? I'm enjoying it a lot. Honestly, if this is more than you expected

456
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,660
Yeah, kind of I mean, okay. So way back when unity was first introduced

457
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:45,900
I guess you could say I was one of the one of the fleeing masses that was like, I don't know about this

458
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,620
I'm gonna go it wasn't out of any like hatred or whatever. I'm I use unity at work

459
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:56,660
I have no problems with it. It turned out to be a pretty good, you know, window manager just display whatever desktop there we go

460
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,660
That's the one

461
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,940
But still it's been so it's been a long time since I felt

462
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:08,060
You know that the Ubuntu desktop was the desktop for me that like I was gonna put it on systems and use it and that it

463
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,360
Would be a workable day-to-day system like work has different constraints, right? But like on my personal machines

464
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:19,120
This feels like I'm not saying that I'm going to but this feels very close to like I could be excited about it

465
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:23,060
The combination of like really good snap support a modern kernel modern

466
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:29,220
Gnome a lot of this like features and things system D has really all that all those changes have really shaken out in Ubuntu

467
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,220
And sure, there's like differences

468
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,940
We were talking before the show about like, you know

469
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,260
I'm used to arch where everything's under user bin and that's not quite so on in in Ubuntu

470
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:45,100
So there are differences, but it's gotten so small that it's just super it's just a super usable setup for me

471
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,920
Hmm. I will be curious like at work

472
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:53,580
I have three monitors connected all by display port and unity handles it pretty darn well not perfect not perfect

473
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,340
But I'll be really curious to see like, you know, you did pretty well with multi monitor setup

474
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,940
So is how does gnome cope with that?

475
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,140
I'm not sure speaking of using in the work environment

476
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,500
one of the things I I use a lot when I'm working on my laptop during the day is

477
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,820
Bluetooth because I have a I have a Bose sound link or whatever

478
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:19,860
It's called and oh, yeah, pretty good sound and I I before Ubuntu 1710 before Ubuntu 1710

479
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:25,700
Every day every morning. I would have to delete the pairing and repair with my Bose what for audio to work?

480
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:31,740
Yeah, it would show up it would connect but pulse would never sound send sound to my bluetooth audio device

481
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,420
but if I delete and repair which is a

482
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,700
Fairly painless process then I could so I just made that part of my morning routine when I was getting down to work

483
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,220
But now with 1710 I have not had to do that Wow

484
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:48,540
So they the I know that they claim a thousand upstream fixes to Bluetooth or bluesy

485
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,100
It would if one of those thousands fixed the fix my problem. I'm very great

486
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:57,340
I will have to do some testing with that. Yeah, I encourage you to have more and more things or Bluetooth

487
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:04,140
And I've also had some anecdotal notes about better mouse pairing and things like that like accessory pairings

488
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:08,340
I've only been testing speakers myself, but because I've all I have I have it. I have another speaker

489
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,180
I had the same problem. It's called the 808 thump same exact problem

490
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:11,700
I was having with the bow

491
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,780
So I know it wasn't unique to the bows because I had the same issue with another Bluetooth speaker both of those work

492
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,300
Very very very happy about that because it's just it's just so nice that I just turn it on and now that becomes my default

493
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:25,540
Sound device and it's that's the way it feels like it's supposed to work along that same line

494
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,540
Well, I'm talking about my my work laptop. I

495
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,660
have a very sort of mixed results with battery life and

496
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:40,580
one of the things that they've done in this release of 1710 is they've spent time on actually getting GPU accelerated video playback to

497
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:47,580
Actually be GPU accelerated. What there's a lot of stuff that claimed to be GPU accelerated playback on Linux Chrome and

498
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:53,660
Odom Odom, I have a totem in my sorry and other there's anyways

499
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:58,060
There's some others that claim to maybe be hardware accelerated but weren't actually hardware accelerated

500
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,260
And so we're sucking a lot of extra CPU

501
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:06,180
Which was using up a lot of extra battery and so I'm hoping to start seeing battery life results

502
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:11,420
I don't really have a good base because the main machine I've been trying I went to on is the first OS

503
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,420
I've ever ran on that machine. It's the Libra

504
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,460
but

505
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:20,420
I'm hoping when I try out my other systems to see an improvement. They're just gonna work. Yeah that that stuff

506
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,820
I'm looking forward to what about you beard? What's been sort of your takeaways with 1710 so far?

507
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,100
Um, it just feels like unity to me

508
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,900
Yeah, pretty much it

509
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:35,620
It's just it doesn't really change at all in terms of you know, how I'd use it. So

510
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:43,100
Good, is that good or bad? Oh good. I didn't mind unity. Yeah. Yeah now I'll I'll tell you it's to me

511
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:50,260
It's it's it's the small stuff that's gonna make this really stand out that I think gonna make this stand out

512
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,940
above and beyond

513
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,940
the other

514
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:59,180
Ubuntu flavors as much respect and we're going to talk about the flavors at a moment as I have for the other flavors

515
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:05,500
There's some stuff in the in my opinion in Ubuntu. No proper or I guess now it's just Ubuntu proper

516
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,420
that

517
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:12,600
Are the kind of refinements that I deeply deeply appreciate and did rocks points out a couple of them here

518
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,500
They said with our trend he says with our transition to gnome shell

519
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:21,660
We're following more closely to gnome upstreams philosophies and we've dropped our header bar patches

520
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,340
And they did some of these patches to you optimize vertical space in the past

521
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:31,340
But it could that they the the downside was is it created a different class of issues

522
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:38,460
Action buttons are generally now on the top and they're pretty much not noticeable with that ambience and radiance themes that Ubuntu ships with

523
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:43,460
Now I'm stopping here for a moment because this is the type of problem that I see in

524
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:49,100
Just about every damn distribution out there with their default themes with maybe the exception of like elementary OS

525
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,940
It's this attention to detail where it doesn't really you know

526
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:55,540
The people don't really care that the buttons don't stand out and if you're watching the video version

527
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,820
I have a screenshot up where the save and cancel buttons

528
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:02,980
They're there, but your eyes aren't really drawn to them if like where West is that can you even tell where they're at from across the room

529
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:08,100
It's a little hard. Oh, that's that's the problem. I ran into earlier where I couldn't find the unlock. Yeah. Yeah, exactly

530
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:13,180
That's exactly that exact one. So they are introducing some some fixes

531
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:19,260
They've introduced some styling for the suggested action and the story behind where they got the green from is actually kind of worth going to read his blog for

532
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,780
And

533
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,820
They're there. They apply these subtleties

534
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:28,300
So here is they've applied a subtle a subtle change to the disabled button

535
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:34,260
So it's obviously disabled and a bold change to the suggested default action button. It draws your eyes immediately

536
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,860
But yeah, it makes it clear and easy to see it's something that if I put this in front of a non-computer user

537
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:45,340
they'd still understand where to click and this is done a hundred times over and over again throughout

538
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:51,940
This theme another example is they've just made small changes to the way the header bar looks when you maximize it

539
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:56,380
So that way the gradients don't conflict with the with the shell gradient. Thank you

540
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,980
I mean, it's it's minor stuff, but it flows better and it eases my brain

541
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:07,660
It's like it could it simmers my brain the F down and I stopped thinking about my desktop environment and I think more about

542
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:10,740
The work I'm doing I was having a conversation with West over lunch

543
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:17,500
And I said what's one of my problems I have with both plasma and mate is I end up thinking a lot about the desktop

544
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,140
Environment, I think about the fact that this icon is slightly smaller than the icon next to it

545
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:26,580
And I think about the fact that maybe the click targets are a little too small for close and maximize and minimize

546
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:31,580
I think about the fact that the fonts wrapping in the menu which makes the whole menu offset and all weird and

547
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,580
None of it really matters except for it steals about 10 to 20 percent of my brain

548
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:40,420
It's the micro distractions that you're constantly keep seen and constant micro abrasions and

549
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:47,660
These have been polished away in this theme that they have for gnome shell it'll edit at a level that

550
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,420
feels really professional

551
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:56,900
And that's something I'm really excited to sit down and just use such a solid implementation of gnome

552
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,940
And the best part is if you want to bail on any of this you can install

553
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:06,060
I think it's just gnome session you install gnome session, and you just log out and log in a gnome session

554
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,540
And it's a just a stock gnome install with no canonical tweaks, okay?

555
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:13,220
That's super simple and then theme it do whatever you want exactly just start from there

556
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:19,500
And you know load up no tweaking that's easy. Yeah, I think it's I think that's a good way to go and then last

557
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,500
but not least

558
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,860
Long-term one of the features. I'm also looking forward to and this is what I think is going to

559
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:31,500
This is what's going to change my my mind about where we use it they're integrating livepatch now into the GUI

560
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,580
So you can use for free the livepatch service

561
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,660
At the GUI level and I think that's gonna

562
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:41,300
That's gonna spur a lot of adoption and it makes me want to use it here on our studio equipment

563
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:46,180
So just for the GUI level you can I'm kind of I'm kind of liking the livepatch service

564
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:49,500
I've been sitting back and watching it and for a production system that I don't reboot often

565
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,820
But I want to stay secure because it's connected to broadcasting to the internet all the time

566
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:56,140
Yeah, it's great. It's great for that. Mm-hmm, and

567
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,460
We've been having we've been having we had a crash today in the middle of the show

568
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:04,900
We've actually had to cut the show and restart the show because no I'm crashed on us today and and I'm whole

569
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:11,380
Being that the 1710 implementation and I'm hoping that three dot two six dot one will be more reliable

570
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,860
And I'm hoping that with with a reliable

571
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,860
well manicured gnome shell

572
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,660
That's been really well thought out and really well implemented by Canonical

573
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:27,860
Plus livepatch so I can keep it secure and I am hoping that that will make a decent production environment

574
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:32,580
That'll be easily updatable to 1804 and then I can just stay at 1804 for a couple of years

575
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,580
Well, I let this stuff work itself out

576
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,700
That's kind of my plan right now can actually have like this is an LTS that works on the desktop

577
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:44,140
I can install it once. Mm-hmm. And for the next couple of years just small changes. I don't have to worry about it

578
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:49,460
Mm-hmm, and for the next couple of years just small changes. I don't have to reinstall. I might not even reboot

579
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:53,660
Yeah, that would be so beard when you get back from twitchcon that week when you get back

580
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,980
I think you and I because I'm gonna wait because I don't want to break it before you go

581
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:03,620
We should reload this both these systems with the boon to 1710 and just we'll report back in the show how that's gone

582
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,500
And we'll just give you guys an update on

583
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:11,260
On how putting the production went what we ran into what it was like to get OBS working and how the performance is compared to arch

584
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,260
And all that stuff

585
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,620
I'm sold in a big way on some of the work

586
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:20,380
They've done and I really am curious to see where this goes for 1804

587
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:26,380
Because if they just keep what they've got and don't screw it up 1804 is gonna be great

588
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,380
Because this is really great and I was looking and don't you think don't you know?

589
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,620
I definitely think don't you think this is yeah, I you and I were talking at lunch

590
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:39,380
Like this is one of the releases that's really actually got us both genuinely interested in years and actually maybe using a boon to on

591
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,860
the desktop again and

592
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,460
I was looking at some results that Joey got over OMG Ubuntu

593
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,140
almost

594
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,140
11,000 votes on this poll which is pretty good

595
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,100
and

596
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:57,540
Still 24% of people said they're not gonna upgrade huh no plans to upgrade now 61% say they do have plans

597
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:02,780
And these are OMG Ubuntu users, so these are like hardcore Ubuntu. Yeah, these are Ubuntu people

598
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,780
Yeah, and only I was surprised 24%

599
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,260
Because it's a good release

600
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:12,140
I guess maybe if you're worried about unity which is we're gonna that's why we're gonna talk about the flavors here in a moment

601
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:17,340
But anybody in the moment room want to jump in with their thoughts so far on the 1710 release or upgrading to 1710

602
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:21,660
Or anybody been trying it. I'd love to get if anybody's been trying to get your thoughts, too. I

603
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,580
Have been trying and it seems rock-solid

604
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:32,540
I even installed pretty much all of the desktop environments at once

605
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,900
No problems

606
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,900
I

607
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:42,860
Just decided well hey, let's go all out. Let's just go ahead and try it and

608
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,700
Yeah, it works perfectly fine. Nothing's crashing on me

609
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:53,260
I haven't I actually had you know you every now and then you get that crash bug popping up to report a bug

610
00:47:53,260 --> 00:48:00,100
I haven't had that happen once the entire time. I've been using nice. Yeah, it has felt really solid to me, too

611
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,840
I have I have been really even impressed with the beta is being solid early on

612
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,680
I I sort of waited a little bit, and then I jumped in I really had I was pretty impressed, okay

613
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:15,540
So I also tried out mate. I've been trying out a bunch of budgie edition and in the past

614
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,540
I thought although not recently had tried out Katie neon

615
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:23,180
So I got I got some flavor discussion to me too if you if you will indulge me

616
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:28,120
Oh, please, and I know I'm sorry. I don't have any kabuntu stuff. I'm sorry. I have not tried out kabuntu stuff

617
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:32,280
That's on you audience you guys go go try that out come back next talk about it

618
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:37,640
I can talk about that. Have you okay? Yeah, how has kabuntu been have been anything noteworthy?

619
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:45,760
Extremely noteworthy they are kind of a release of plasma behind there on 5.10 as opposed to 5.11

620
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,200
Which just came out however 5.11 will be in the backports

621
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,280
Repository the PPA that they have so you can just go down and get that

622
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,880
But other than that

623
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,560
Man rock solid like I said, but it's saying about everything else good

624
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,960
This is going to be a bunch of new people coming to know I bet I've got a lot of new people

625
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,000
And then there's going to be some people that are mutiny we'll talk about that in a moment

626
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:16,200
But first let's talk about linux.ting.com go to linux.ting.com to support the show and get $25 in ting credit or

627
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,920
$25 in purchasing power

628
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:24,240
How about that off a device you can buy a devices from ting directly if you bring one will give you a service credit and they

629
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,120
Have a CDMA and a GSM network so it's a lot of devices pretty much works

630
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,840
Anywhere pretty much you might be able to just find a device that works with ting check out

631
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:39,440
Linux dot ting.com it's pay for what you use wireless your minutes your messages and your megabytes whatever you use

632
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:42,240
That's all you got to pay. We have to pay for what you use nope

633
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,960
You don't got to pay you know you know and you don't have to pay for what you might use

634
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,560
Which is how they actually get you which is really incredible

635
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,320
Imagine if you had to pay for things like in all the things like how much gas you might use

636
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,640
That's crazy. I mean crazy

637
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:01,920
You're doing a lot of things so like yeah, oh for sure like TV like health coverage. Yep. Yep. Yep insurance

638
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,160
Yeah, there's I know it's we hate all those I do

639
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:09,020
I really do yeah ting is doing way the way the mobile is like if they had to like

640
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:13,600
Everybody to start over like right now like everybody had to hit the reset button and everybody had to compete fairly

641
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,960
This is how the entire industry would work. Where's where's our king insurance?

642
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,700
I well

643
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:22,680
I think you know what they should come up with some sort of plan like that like like ting plan pay for what you use

644
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,360
Healthcare with so we need more people to go sign up for ting try them out. Yeah, get critical mass

645
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:32,820
Yeah, I'll be forced to ensure us it would it would take Canadians to say are already expanding into internet there you go

646
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:38,900
There you go. Anyways, get in now other than phones linux.ting.com go there. Try it out. No contracts

647
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:44,240
No determination fees. They got a great blog to lots of good stuff on the blog recently lots of good stuff Chris

648
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:48,120
I want that tank fiber so bad. Mmm, man, that would be a life-changer

649
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,440
Life we'd be launching the Jupiter broadcasting data centers. I tell you what

650
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,720
Oh, man, JB DC. Yeah, cooled cooled in oil

651
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,560
Mm-hmm. Yeah, the the the jb pain to service but oh, yeah

652
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:07,280
Yeah, but coke is a real good fry coconut oil cooled servers. That's right fiber connected

653
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,680
Anyways, get started by going to linux.ting.com and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring the unplug

654
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,560
Linux dot ting calm Linux dot ting calm put that in your history bar and support the show

655
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:20,800
Remember how history bars used to be a big thing. Oh, man

656
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,460
All right. So let's start with the Internet's favorite. That would be a buntu matte

657
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:32,800
1710 and this is all this work. This I would say is the release for for unity refugees

658
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:38,560
People that aren't ready to go to know they like the HUD. They like comp is

659
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,480
They miss what wouldn't you used to be a bit?

660
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,800
Man, it did wimpy and team nail it

661
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,220
so the thing is most of us know but if you don't that they have going for them is they have this

662
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,920
mate tweak tool and you go in there and you choose the mutiny layout and

663
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:01,480
You know snap your fingers and next thing, you know, you've got essentially the unity desktop

664
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:07,680
But really like that like all the people I put my time. I showed them all the options most universally people have picked mutiny

665
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:11,040
Yep. Yep, same same same but you see what right you can see it right there

666
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,560
You see how that button is smaller than the Firefox button. Oh, yeah, huh?

667
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,480
Oh, man, and you see how this is a circle

668
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,520
but then that is two shirts that aren't a circle and then that's a square and

669
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,320
Then that one has like this extra thing that goes above the square and then these are different shaped squares. Yeah

670
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,920
Not gonna have that. Oh

671
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,640
What you're saying is can't do that wimpy should have gotten a Chris last consult. Yeah, I don't know

672
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,560
Maybe you will so I also want to give a tip of the hat to brisk

673
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:41,520
My favorite part of using mate was the brisk menu really good

674
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:47,680
I know it's a seems like a small thing but having a super fast launcher that gets my searches every time I type them and

675
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,600
Then I hit enter and it launches the app. I expected every damn time

676
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:56,520
Dad made me happy. I like that a lot that really so the the mate layout

677
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:59,360
Oh and then and then you guys know I just professed recently again

678
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:03,800
My love for comp is and the way it makes my windows look all this you get with Ubuntu mate

679
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,680
right now I

680
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,680
feel like

681
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:15,200
Ubuntu budgie and Ubuntu mate are the number one landing spots for unity refugees

682
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,760
Because Ubuntu budgie gives you sort of the advantages of the nice clean budgie desktop. They're also GTK

683
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,320
But you get that Ubuntu base

684
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:30,980
So I think those are two very competitive alternative flavors for the 1710 release and then you're gonna have your folks that are willing

685
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:35,120
To go to XFCE or willing to go to plasma if they're if they're gonna take an extra leap

686
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:41,360
But I think I would predict Ubuntu budgie and Ubuntu mate this release cycle will pick up the most converts

687
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:48,400
From the from core Ubuntu, but I think core Ubuntu is going to benefit from a lot of new people coming in to check out

688
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,360
What they're doing on gnome. I am I'm coming back. I'm coming back to Ubuntu

689
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:57,720
I'm I I have been I have been distro hopping for six seven months now and

690
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,400
It's been awful. I just hated it. I just don't like it. We installing things. No solid foundation

691
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,000
Okay, is this the system that has all of my stuff synced or is that the other system is this one have dropbox installed?

692
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,360
Is that one does this one have last pass?

693
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:15,880
You know all this crap software that I have to drag around with me now that is just awful to set up constantly over and over

694
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,920
again

695
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,920
It'd be nice to be past that. Yeah, I

696
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,200
Just I wanted it to be mounted

697
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,720
I really didn't install it if you if you ever need to I really wanted it to be because I you know

698
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:34,040
I I've I've been having known issues recently as we just talked about so I was ready to just be like screw the whole thing

699
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,600
Middle fingers up in the air. I'm out of here. Peace out. Thanks for all the fish so long

700
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,720
But then after going through the whole round of them

701
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:48,280
The one that compels me the most and it actually fires me up to use is this new Ubuntu proper?

702
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,840
It's just such a solid release. It's such a good implementation of it

703
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,240
Even if I don't stick with it

704
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,700
I've got to use it for a little while cuz I've just got to kick the tires on this this this

705
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,840
This kind of thing. It doesn't happen a lot in Linux anymore. No, not really

706
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,840
They've we've had very slow and steady progress releases for years now

707
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:10,040
Not that that's a bad thing. No, it isn't it's I just in fact, I figured okay, it's good

708
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,280
It's actually time for like we're just slowly gonna iterate and fix things

709
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,800
We could use a little more of that sometimes

710
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,840
so I didn't think of it badly but I

711
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,080
Think we've forgotten sort of what this feels like again to have a to have a company

712
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,520
Come along and make something where they ask us what we want

713
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:30,620
And then they actually listened when we said what we wanted and then when they went and had and made their own changes to it

714
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:36,400
They wouldn't they talked to the developers upstream. It's just weird, right? That's crazy. It doesn't happen very often

715
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,520
So I really enjoyed using it now

716
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,960
Are you gonna stick with it on any of your machines or what would it take to get you to switch away from arch?

717
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:51,600
No, because you got pretty good software availability. I sure do. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I very well might I'm doing more and more things

718
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,480
With a bunch of on other systems, especially like cloud servers, etc

719
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,600
And so it is I gotta say it is real nice to have just the one

720
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:03,840
Operating system going and it's gotten a lot easier to like one software availability is better

721
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,840
And it's pretty easy to run

722
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:11,880
These days with all the tooling a bunch who has like to run an arch user land or an arch container for other things that I might

723
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,320
Need or an arch VM. So there's a good possibility

724
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:17,840
It'll be on some of my systems at least for a while for me

725
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:23,280
If it's my work system the number one feature that they're really competing with when it comes to arch

726
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,920
It's not the AUR which I think is what everybody assumes it is

727
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,040
It's the fact that if I play my cards, right?

728
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,040
I never have to reload that system

729
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:38,480
That install of arch will last as long as that physical hardware lasts and that is so nice because when you move into a distro

730
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,920
Like that when you can get like a five or six year install going and it works good

731
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,800
Mm-hmm, and it's still good performance

732
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,560
Especially on a machine where you don't like, you know what you do with it. You just you get in you update it

733
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:54,560
Yeah, mostly doesn't break. Yeah, that's why I think if I was really gonna use a bunch you I might actually

734
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,160
Ironically be an LTS guy. Yeah

735
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,880
And I don't really cuz I haven't run Ubuntu on as my daily driver for so long

736
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,880
I don't really know what the upgrade

737
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,340
Success rate is like if I if I have a semi customized system with a few snaps

738
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:14,160
Maybe a couple of PPAs and a few theme modifications or whatever and then I upgrade that to an 1804

739
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:19,880
What tells me you're gonna find that out and it'll be the first time that you're doing it with gnome 3 on Ubuntu

740
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,880
Yep, so it's there's no guarantees

741
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,160
So I don't know. I can't sit here and say I'm gonna have a smooth upgrade 1804

742
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,680
I can hope for one I can expect for one, but I can't say it's gonna happen

743
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,600
But I'm gonna roll that dice and I'm gonna load my current systems with 1710

744
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:42,540
Assuming that I can get to 1804 one way or another right and if this is any sign 1804 will be that thing that you've wanted

745
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:47,040
We're like, okay. Well, I'm just gonna sit here for a while. Yeah. See you in four years

746
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:52,080
Bluetooth fixes alone GPU video accelerated fixes and

747
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,400
No, three two six one almost make it worth kicking the tires right there

748
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:02,480
then if you would like to get into like their live patch stuff and if you want to play with snap packages and

749
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:07,160
This is a really competitive distribution, but even if you're not into that stuff

750
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,840
There's a few things I'm gonna so this is the first review. We're gonna talk about this next week

751
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,400
I'm going to I don't know if this will work out

752
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,120
I meant to try to lock this down before the show

753
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,800
I'm going to invite will cook and some of his team to come on the show next week

754
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,280
Awesome host released to talk about it. That's great. Hopefully it'll work out

755
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,280
We talked about it a boon to rally, but I'm sure this is a busy time for him

756
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:31,040
And I did mean to try to confirm with him before the show, but we've been so giddy about the plane

757
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,200
We really were I forgot to so that that's that's my fault

758
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,640
But I want to follow up next week talk about putting in production a little bit

759
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,120
I want to talk about using a live patch service a little bit next week some of those things do some follow-up stuff

760
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,960
So I bet by then two more people hell have pulled down after the actual release and tried it out

761
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,840
So if you'd like to join us in the discord for trying out discord next week

762
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:53,280
You can do that come into discord and let us know your take on it

763
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:59,000
I'm hoping will and team will be in there with us discord Ubuntu 1710 release party next Tuesday

764
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,280
Yeah, sure. It's a little late, but better late than never mm-hmm. Hey, I can't believe I'm gonna be installing Ubuntu

765
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:10,880
That's awesome. I'm like I have one Ubuntu machine here in the studio run mumble right now, and that's it

766
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,520
I've been one meaning to reinstall it was gonna be arched on one of my like my main work

767
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,480
Non-portable machine at home. I think tonight. It's gonna be paved with Ubuntu. Oh

768
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:25,360
Mom, I'll give you guys last words on 1710 or on any of the flavors if anybody else has any thoughts, but otherwise

769
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,520
I'll leave it there, and I can't wait to see

770
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,040
1804 what about you beard any other closing thoughts on this?

771
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:39,480
Release I'm a bit trepidatious over the fact that you're gonna be loading these machines with the boot. Yeah considering West has already had a gnome crash

772
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:46,280
Yeah, that is the thing isn't it although it can't crash more probably, but maybe it could I'm thinking I'm gonna

773
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:52,360
These will be the last machines, so we'll do these next week, and then before then I'll do air master and

774
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,800
I will I will reload you're reloading everything. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I'm going all-in

775
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:01,140
I thought you'd keep like one machine anchored somewhere

776
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:06,360
Yeah, but I'm so hodgepodge right now. I've got solace, and I've got arch, and I've got Ubuntu

777
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:10,600
I've got all all the mixes and I've even got a pop machine in the mix

778
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,000
It's hard to keep that all in your head sometimes

779
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,780
I mean it's fine when you're on one system

780
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:19,520
But like when you rapidly switch you really kind of start feeling the cost and I just kind of want to settle down

781
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:25,880
Just want to get settled, so I'm I'm motivated to start wiping motivated to format West. It's just so much fun, too

782
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,560
I'll be here to

783
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:34,800
Comfort you when you come to cry on my shoulder, and I actually like the Ubuntu installer like I'm just not an anaconda fan

784
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:40,280
So this one, and I don't use I mean most of my installs are arch right so like I don't usually use a gooey installer

785
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,600
Yeah, but a bunch of want like it's really not too bad. I know it. It's easy

786
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:48,700
So it's just quick to get through yeah, it really is it's it's non-offensive. It's not like the most powerful

787
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:54,940
Right and but I usually just do all my partitioning beforehand, and I just bit basic stuff, too

788
01:00:54,960 --> 01:01:00,440
Yeah, I didn't really I you did have a bootloader problem. I did and what was that about well

789
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,280
I'm not a hundred percent sure I might actually try it again and see if that same issue crops up

790
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:10,880
But I have multiple machines on here, and it's UEFI. Yeah, so I know so my systems are all you

791
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:17,520
Yeah, for some reason it did not it might have been a discrepancy between where arch did you mounted versus where?

792
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,960
Ubuntu mounts so you create a slash boot yeah, and you created it using extended for

793
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:27,680
Exa fast butter fence would you I reused my existing slash boot which was already?

794
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:33,600
If I and fat and set up which had my existing bootloader on it. Oh, okay. I'm tracking now

795
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,760
Yeah, that could have been what it was in the past

796
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:36,740
It's worked fine like okay

797
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:42,720
So do anaconda's credit like fedora installs just fine and just replaces my arch bootloader with you know the EFI

798
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:46,200
Executable that gets picked is that one instead I assume this will work, too

799
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,440
So I'll give it another shot because I normally it works pretty well

800
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:52,640
But this time it didn't so I'll be something I'll fix after the show yeah

801
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:59,040
I I had I had one system where I almost accidentally installed my bootloader on the thumb drive

802
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:04,960
Because you know with MV&E drives, and I'm so used to watching for Dev SDA as my first drive

803
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:09,600
Oh, yeah, but in this case the thumb drive was Dev SDA, and I for a moment

804
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:15,700
Almost clicked the wrong drive in the installer and it took a moment go no Chris. Don't don't do that

805
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:19,640
That would be a very embarrassing mistake. Don't make that mistake and so I

806
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:23,760
I almost did it, but I caught there well the good thing about installing it on a thumb drive

807
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,400
Is you make that mistake you just take the drive and throw it away. That's true. Nobody ever knows that's true

808
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,320
Yeah, except for I almost would have just outed myself here on this podcast

809
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,120
So that would have been that would have been good enough all right well

810
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:38,800
I would love to hear your experience with the new release, and I'm pretty excited about it as I said

811
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,280
I think it represents just an incredible amount of work

812
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,960
and in a way

813
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:47,440
Better than I expected it to be too. Yeah, and it just feels

814
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,560
I don't know. I don't know like I feel like we've had a hard time explaining it

815
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:54,960
It just feels good to be this excited about in a bunch of release again. Yeah

816
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,000
I think that is like a coming home kind of feeling I

817
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,280
Think it's just nice. They didn't blow it

818
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,880
I think it's really nice that they figured out how to work upstream in the right way

819
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:10,200
It's it's a bit too soon to say they didn't blow give them time. Yeah, maybe I haven't had a unless something sneaks its way in

820
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:15,560
I haven't really had any any show-stopping issues yet. I have had any gnome crashes either with it

821
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:21,560
But then again, I've only been primarily using it on Intel. Are you on Intel hardware to them? I sure am hmm

822
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,760
When you have a optimist system at home hybrid graphics, so I'll be trying that yeah

823
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,640
This is gonna be when we loaded on the production systems here. This will be in video

824
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,620
This would be yeah, maybe maybe that'll be a different bottle of wax

825
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:40,600
I guess I guess that also means I guess that also means I've been using Wayland now for weeks, and I didn't even really

826
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:44,760
You to get you two bastards are using Wayland right now, too. Yeah

827
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:49,160
Don't don't let our secrets out. Holy crap you guys

828
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:55,080
We don't get these this pixel perfect frame rate just by accident. We're all a bunch of Wayland users now

829
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:59,740
Oh my goodness that I didn't see coming. There is your big development right there

830
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,800
Wow

831
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,560
well

832
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:08,040
I'm looking forward to kicking the tires some more reformatting my machines losing a bit more data

833
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:13,640
I kid do your backups kids do your backups go put it all up on the cloud somewhere where somebody can index it real

834
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:18,760
Good for you. You know what we didn't even mention what ZFS support still continues to be rockin on a bunch

835
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:22,560
You so yeah, I thought about it, but I have to install ZFS a little more

836
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:29,320
I want more backups there. Give me more. Okay. Give me more ZFS integration. Where's my ZFS gooey, right? Yeah, okay, right?

837
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:33,240
I want a paperclip wizard, etc. All right. Thank you for being here guys

838
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:36,600
Join us live next week over to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar for our lifetime

839
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:41,240
JBLive.tv is where you watch it and go to linuxunplug.reddit.com to thanks for being here

840
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,600
You

841
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,820
Know the more I think about it. It seems obvious like on our production system. I'm gonna use X

842
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:29,520
That's I'm not gonna use Wayland on the OBS system. That's probably why you crashed

843
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:35,200
Maybe it might be what's up. That might be it. So I guess I should go look at some logs

844
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:42,240
Do you have your titles calm? Thank you mumble room. Yeah guys here. Yeah. See you later. I gotta get my son. All right. All righty

845
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:48,600
How did how did an episode I've been looking forward to for doing for six months end up being short and low-energy

846
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:54,120
How did that how did that combination happen? It's because we didn't start the caffeine till a Chris you think

847
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,000
Maybe I don't think so

848
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:00,320
I'm surprised you didn't have Martin or Alan here. I

849
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,560
Had a sense. They weren't gonna be here today, although I don't remember why

850
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,480
I

851
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:09,720
Forget I like get finished ready and up for this release man. No, I have no idea

852
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:33,560
Yeah, cool for us, but it's kind of good, you know, so that way we can you know, this is our take unbiased. Yeah, no influence
