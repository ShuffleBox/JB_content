1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Feel like pre-show should be Brent's department, you know, yeah, he is good at scouring strange and interesting things

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,480
Brent anything in the pre-show department this week. Well

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,760
Pre-shows give me sex. I think here I got a mouthful of trail mix. Check your folder

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,920
Open up your pre-show folder. I know you have a manila folder over there, right? I say that right West manila. Mm-hmm

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,680
Okay, thank you. It's actually vanilla manila. Well, he's got you've got the scented ones. Yeah, you just got the scratch and sniff envelopes

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,680
I know that

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,600
Hello friends and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,560
Hello West

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:50,240
374 is brought to you by the all-new a cloud guru the leader in learning for cloud Linux and other modern tech skills

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,880
Hundreds of courses thousands of hands-on labs get certified get hired get learning a cloud guru comm

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,880
West today on the show

12
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:04,600
It's one of those where we adventure out into the server garage and we attempt to do something that we probably should have taken a few

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,600
More precautions before we even got started

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,320
That's for sure. I

15
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,760
Mean it was a while ago on the show a few weeks back

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,280
We have updated people on our setup with next cloud. It was a question that came into the show

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,440
362 of this podcast

18
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,760
So it's been a little bit

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,400
we reveal how much we were spending per month and I think people were shocked and so we set out on a mission to

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,400
tighten that up by quite a bit and

21
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:38,120
Update reconfigure and maybe come up with a damn near most perfect next cloud setup. I've ever seen that is fairly bulletproof

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,160
it's portable and

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,240
Something we're gonna recommend in a little bit

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,680
But we have a lot to do before we get there including some community news that I'm very excited about

25
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,160
So to help us analyze all of this it is our team of experts time-appropriate greeting virtual log

26
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:04,280
Was a good one, hey, you know 22 strong this week we've had more but I think maybe one of the better intros there

27
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,020
So hello everybody. Thanks for being here with us today

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,640
Why don't we start with a little KTE news because it's been a while since we've talked about the plasma desktop too long

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,380
The excellent plasma desktop and KD developers for more than a year have been working to evolve the default breeze theme

30
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:26,440
Which that work is being done by the KD visual design group and it's finally paying off with an initial breeze

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,500
Evolution breeze evolution is a modest refresh to the UI so far various subtle changes have landed around window shadows

32
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,080
sidebars and color alterations

33
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,680
More work on breeze evolution will continue leading up to its debut in KD plasma 5.21

34
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,760
Oh, I look forward to that also happening is some work on K wins Wayland virtual keyboard

35
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,640
Which now you're ready for this supports GTK applications that you didn't think that's what I was gonna say. Oh

36
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,220
That's neat. Yeah, we'll have a link to the blog post by

37
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,040
Nate who we've had on the show before that covers this and a bunch of other really cool stuff

38
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,080
Coming to the next update in KTE. It's such a nice solid performer these days

39
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,000
and I think we have slipped into a mistake of not talking about it very much and

40
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,400
So we wanted to write that wrong with kind of some really thought-provoking KTE discussion that came out of Academy 2020

41
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,120
Oh, yes at that annual KTE conference

42
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,980
Of course held virtually this year KD developer and the head Graham delivered a talk entitled visions of the future

43
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,380
About the possible future of KTE on commercial products

44
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,060
subtitled plasma sold on retail hardware

45
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:45,940
Lots of it the session concentrated on ways to make KTE applications and also the plasma desktop the default

46
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,260
environment on hardware sold to the general public

47
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:56,260
the proposal includes creating an official KD distribution with a hardware certification program and

48
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:03,140
Directly paying developers. Yeah, there's also another bombshell in here and I got some audio from the event

49
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,260
But we'll also link to the entire YouTube video Graham started by giving some context

50
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,620
the ideas that were to be presented was a follow-up on the entire KD accessibility and

51
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:19,540
Productivity goals that we talked to him about in 2017 and one of the objectives was to get plasma and KTE

52
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,140
applications ready to work on all kinds of hardware

53
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:30,420
well Graham thinks that this has been achieved and now it's time to move to the next step for KTE and that is

54
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,380
creating an official KTE

55
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:40,060
Operating system. I think what that next thing is is to create an official KTE OS

56
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,100
So you might ask why would we want to do this?

57
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,820
Well, the simplest reason is we have to if we want a direct relationship with hardware vendors

58
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:57,020
Because that's what they need they need an OS and that means working with distro partners or it means having our own OS and we

59
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:04,700
Love our distro partners. I do too, but having our own OS allows us to have our own relationship with them

60
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,500
And thankfully we already have one that OS is neon

61
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,660
Unfortunately neon is is a bit of a halfway product

62
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:19,780
It's mostly designed to showcase KTE software non KTE software can be very outdated and does not necessarily

63
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:24,580
Guarantee to work. It has a very small development team and most puzzlingly

64
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,900
We don't admit that KTE neon is an OS in our own messaging

65
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,900
On the other hand KTE neon is indeed enough of an OS that the slim book people ship it on their hardware and

66
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:43,700
Lots and lots of people use it as their daily driver on their own computers, including my wife. She loves it. It's really great

67
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:50,420
So I think it's time for us to finally admit that neon is a real OS and treat it as such

68
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:57,300
We can say that it's what we believe the reference implementation of KTE software ought to look like and promote it accordingly

69
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,980
You know just clean up our messaging a little bit many make this sounds similar to an initiative by the gnome folks

70
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,780
Doesn't it? Yeah, it's a little bit different

71
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:12,100
Yeah, indeed. It does. I mean it was years ago that gnome developers wanted to create a gnome OS

72
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,740
because they thought that they would be just

73
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:21,460
Good to have it its own OS but never appeared. Well, they're still kind of working on it

74
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,100
I heard them talking about it at this year's Gwadek

75
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:30,980
So it may still be coming there are isos out there. This does make me think sometimes when we talk about this, you know, we

76
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:36,020
Lament default settings at least occasionally and historically in some of these big desktop environments

77
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:42,740
And I wonder if some more of this vertical integration actually more, you know more fully shipping something that's considered an OS

78
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:50,020
I wonder if that will have any impact, you know, I'm sitting here right now reading this news off of a machine running KDE neon

79
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:57,220
I mean west you have even the foggiest guess of how old this install is older than 2018. Maybe 2017. No

80
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:05,460
No, it's getting close to three years. I'd say at least it's a pretty solid desktop as a pretty happy KDE neon user

81
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,860
I kind of wondered well

82
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,900
What would a more official KDE neon look like and nate has thoughts on that as well

83
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,740
First of all, it would have the latest kernels in it for hardware enablement purposes

84
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,500
It would probably have a method to have newer kernels in it than even its parent OS Ubuntu does

85
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,620
It would have more up-to-date third-party apps

86
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,500
If not from the repos then maybe from flat pack or snap or one of these

87
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,900
Generally new generation

88
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,220
app

89
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,140
Deployment mechanisms that we support it would have a lot more development resources, too

90
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,780
And this is sort of a call to action here. I think if you want to make this happen

91
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,260
Please please go ahead and help out

92
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:53,380
There's also the possibility that in case neon's Ubuntu base ever proves unsuitable for some reason

93
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:58,820
It could be rebased on another OS. I I think we can be fairly agnostic about that

94
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:04,660
And generally our new neon based KDE OS would just be more awesome in every way

95
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,220
That's that's what I think is the most important thing about it. I don't know about that new base OS

96
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,260
I really appreciate that. It's based on Ubuntu actually

97
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,020
I think Nate's a big OpenSUSE Leap fan

98
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,140
So I understand, but I I think that'd be

99
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:26,180
Really something if the project started being just a little more upfront. Yeah, this is actually the official OS

100
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,900
and this is what our developers are using and targeting and this is what we're working with hardware providers and

101
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,820
Nate also talked about a hardware certification program that would sort of go

102
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:42,980
Along with this and so there's several official goals. I think that they would foresee with an actual KDE OS

103
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,460
I think the end result of this would be pretty beneficial for us because

104
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:53,220
Because we would be able to work directly with hardware vendors in in a better way

105
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,940
Having neon has already allowed us to do this

106
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:03,140
And I think it's important that we continue to improve that offering so that we can improve our ability to work with hardware vendors

107
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,820
And I think there's also a very good chance as I mentioned earlier that

108
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:14,180
Making neon our own official reference implementation of KDE software would encourage other KDE

109
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,400
Distros to to up their game do a better job

110
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,640
Not to say that they do a bad job. Obviously I use a non

111
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,440
Neon distro and I think they do a great job, but there's always room for improvement everywhere

112
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,760
Right, and I think this is an example where competition

113
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:35,480
Potential to help everybody there is one concern I'd have about this and I'd be interested to know

114
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,800
What some of the developers using neon and creating neon think about this

115
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,240
Is it seems like it would take away this development playground where they can try things out

116
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,880
If it needs to all of a sudden be a quote-unquote

117
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,680
reference implementation

118
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,800
Then the burden of getting it right

119
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,600
And having it polished is a bit higher, isn't it? Yeah, right

120
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,000
I mean I think right now as we use KDE neon we kind of have a caveat of like well

121
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
You know, we don't really we shouldn't really treat it like it's stable

122
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,720
You probably shouldn't use it unless you're willing to have your desktop

123
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,960
Maybe possibly break and in practice

124
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't think that's really happened or if it does happen it updates so frequently that the next day, you know

125
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,640
You've got an update fixing whatever small regression happened

126
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,240
but they probably still need a playground right like some sort of

127
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,720
A new area testing branch of if KDE neon itself becomes something more like stable

128
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,800
I have a question for a couple of you in the mumble room. Maybe I'll start with Brent and Carl

129
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,040
What are your thoughts on?

130
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,280
Almost more fragmentation in the Linux landscape if we start seeing different

131
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,760
Distros spin up into their quote-unquote own operating systems for hardware deals. Are you concerned at all about?

132
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,360
More distros more fragmentation more islands. That's a question that comes up often, isn't it?

133
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,160
And I I wonder if our energy like in developers will get spread out

134
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,080
It feels like we're a little thin already

135
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,120
So if we start going into all our own little projects around every single little technology

136
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,680
Is that going to cause some problems but maybe?

137
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,860
On the flip side, maybe it's a good thing. Maybe it means that hardware manufacturers

138
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,760
There's a lot more opportunity there than there was even a year or two ago

139
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,040
So maybe it's a maybe it's a good sign very true. It could be I really don't have a problem with it

140
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,480
I mean the way I look at it

141
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,480
It's people's free time and they can spend it how they want to and you know for a lot of them

142
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,440
It's their creative outlet

143
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,600
They're going to have opinions about the way they want to do things and I have no problem with that whatsoever

144
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,200
And at least for the moment, right? They are still based on the ubuntu base. So if anything maybe that just adds some

145
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:40,440
Draws some folks might use a different kde based distro over to the ubuntu world and you know more testers there

146
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,160
Mm-hmm. And if you think about it at that level

147
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,600
Well, then really it's getting pretty standardized stuff here. You have an ubuntu base. It's using system d

148
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,600
it uses a kernel of a certain version that has these certain features and

149
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,020
You start to realize it's not really all of that fragmented

150
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,500
I mean at that layer at that level things are actually becoming more and more consistent

151
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,140
Despite what some people would prefer

152
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,860
I'm going to keep listening for this haven't heard much from the

153
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,140
Kde neon folks, but would love to know their thoughts on this if this is something they'd be interested in pursuing and then

154
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,220
if it is

155
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,540
How do we as a community step up and support it and make it happen because i'd love to

156
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,700
To know that this kde neon install that I have here is the official

157
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,980
Kde plasma os and that it's going to be supported and around for a long time

158
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,700
That just kind of as an end user gives me a little more reassurance

159
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:36,300
I'm, not convinced. That's who neon is designed for right now, but uh, maybe that's the transition they can make

160
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,620
Maybe they're willing to take that transition

161
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,460
Linode.com slash unplugged get a

162
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,500
100.60 day credit on your new linode account. We'll have a link in the show notes or you just go to linode.com slash unplugged

163
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:56,140
They're the largest independent cloud provider full stop and they make it easy for anyone at any skill level to get started

164
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,060
No matter what technology stack you use linode can help your ideas come to life

165
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,680
If you just need a personal web server for a blog or a portfolio

166
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,740
Or maybe your business needs to scale to serve millions

167
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,100
Linode can help you with that and unlike entry-level hosting services that lock you into their platform

168
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,900
Linode gives you full back-end access to customize and control your server to fit your needs

169
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:22,540
They have a great dns manager simple to take backups one click app deployments

170
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,460
And if kubernetes is your speed to manage your infrastructure linode has you covered there

171
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,820
You can easily manage your kubernetes cluster with linode's fully managed container orchestration engine

172
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:37,500
Also a great way to learn if you want to learn cyber security or practice something before you have to do it in production

173
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,620
Linode has some great options there at great price points

174
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,580
But one of the things that I encourage you to look into is their s3 compatible object storage

175
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,740
If you're not familiar object storage is essentially an easy way for you to store and access data in the cloud

176
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,940
Without having to run a front-end file server. It's perfect for data. That doesn't change regularly

177
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,100
This is where we use it all the time for show assets that are essentially static

178
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,460
And what something is up in their s3 compatible object storage

179
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:11,100
It's really easy to get a url and share that file if you want or maybe even use something like that to power a static website

180
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:18,780
We use linode's powerful virtual servers to run our infrastructure our matrix server our encoding server our new next cloud server

181
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,220
All of it's on linode. My personal servers are on linode

182
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:30,860
Linode started in 2003 as one of the first companies to even get into what is now known as cloud computing three years before aws

183
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:38,220
Go check it out. See what i've been raving about and support one of our sponsors who's made our transition to independence possible

184
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:46,460
linode.com slash unplugged thanks to linode for sponsoring the show and thanks to everyone who supports our sponsors out there linode.com

186
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:58,220
So let's talk a little more hardware this got me thinking this week nvidia unveiled a raspberry pi competitor

187
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:05,260
We've got hardware on the brain. And so I kind of wanted to just chat about this with you guys and just in time

188
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:11,900
A wild. Mr. Drew has snuck into the studio. Hello, drew. Hello, chris. Good to have you here

189
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:18,060
You know the state of disarray that our hardware is slowly devolving into here in the studio

190
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:23,020
It's all reached like the five year mark or something like that since we built it or maybe four year

191
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,300
I'm, not sure it runs 24 seven. So in computer years, it's a lot

192
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,620
and

193
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,780
Wes and I spent some time this weekend racking our brains on

194
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,940
on how to really kind of

195
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,660
attack this problem and

196
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:44,220
Figure out like should we should we build it differently? Should we say break the system up into six or seven individual components?

197
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,940
Or should we consolidate it down into one really super powerful rig?

198
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,540
I mean we've kicked around all the different scenarios and listener of the show mike f has sent us some hardware recently

199
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:01,020
Which is still coming. It's still inbound west. There's still more. Oh boy. Yeah, and one of the things he sent us

200
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,460
Is a batch like a lot

201
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,340
of pine 64

202
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,100
one gigabyte

203
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,420
Small boards, you know ones that are closer to the raspberry pi. They have the gpio ports

204
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,300
um, I don't think it's the rock pro 64, but it's

205
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:22,060
It's still a it's still a little pine board and we're not really even sure what we're going to do with all of them

206
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,700
You know, what do you do with like seven boards like that?

207
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,140
And so then I so I started thinking well

208
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:31,820
Maybe like we could use them as sensors, you know, like a temperature sensor out in the server room to check check in on that

209
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,820
So anyways, like it's we're in this weird hardware phase right now where we need to replace our recording machine

210
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,100
which currently runs, uh zubuntu

211
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:50,220
It might have actually been kubuntu converted to zubuntu for some reason and that runs reaper which records individual tracks for everyone in mumble and

212
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,500
For myself and wes and drew and then it also

213
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,540
So routes the audio out to remote people and remote guests

214
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,540
And then the other machine that's kind of falling apart on us is the obs machine

215
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:05,980
Which does the live stream and records any videos if we record video versions and captures all of that and puts it out?

216
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,940
and also makes our backup recording both of these machines are just completely falling apart and

217
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,180
I don't think these arm boards are where we need them yet

218
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,780
But it has started to enter our mind that maybe in the future

219
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:24,940
We're going to start replacing these x86 systems with these low power arm systems that could be freaking mounted to the table

220
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:33,520
Just put them up under the table right small lower power maybe fanless and if they're cheap easily replaceable sort of standardizable

221
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,980
So nvidia comes along

222
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,180
With their lowest priced arm small board computer to date

223
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,660
They're really kind of focusing this at the developer market robotics market. It's

224
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:50,060
For small tasks that need pretty high-end cpu and gpu for what you get in this form factor

225
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:57,260
It's called the jetson nano and it's already pretty cheap, but today they're introducing a $60 version

226
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,740
So their standard jetson nano was a hundred dollars, but now they're introducing a $60 version

227
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:08,860
That looks like it's priced pretty nice for what you actually get in something this size. Well, yeah, right? I mean it's $59

228
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,740
The usd and it's quite similar to the $99 full full board

229
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,340
But with just two gigs of system memory rather than four

230
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,580
So it's kind of in direct competition with the higher end raspberry pi models

231
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,580
But it has a more powerful tegra gpu and nvidia's extensive

232
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,420
gpu optimized software solutions if you're into that

233
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:37,100
Well, there's a lot of people that are basing their software around it and $60 gets you four cortex a57 cores at 1.43 gigahertz

234
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,140
like west said two gigs of ram you had micro sd

235
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:45,180
And there's 128 core maxwell gpu on this thing that has nvec

236
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,740
Which is their nvidia encoding and cuda capabilities?

237
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,900
It also has so you can get the data in and out of there pretty fast gigabit ethernet hdmi output and three

238
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,220
Usb 3.0 ports. Oh, isn't that fancy?

239
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:04,060
Now the arm cores on the raspberry pi 4 should probably perform a little bit better

240
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:09,900
But the jetson nano 2 gig has the much more capable gpu and I think you kind of hit on it there with the cuda

241
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,020
support

242
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,420
Sort of more similar to a board that you might run on a standard x86 environment

243
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,020
So if you just need to do this, maybe in the field

244
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,780
You've already got stuff optimized for the nvidia stack and you just want to run the same stack

245
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,260
But in a smaller lower power form factor, maybe this looks pretty interesting

246
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:32,860
Um, I can't help but feel the elephant in the room is apple has an arm announcement next week as we record this

247
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,580
on tuesday

248
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,580
Uh, we've been kicking around the whole arm development angle on coda radio, which by the way everybody

249
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,300
Coda radio is back. If you didn't know

250
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,900
Coda radio program

251
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,340
Coder dot show. Is it just me or is there a new one dropping today?

252
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,580
I think there's a new one dropping probably as we speak. So check it out coder dot show

253
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,820
It's back the last few episodes. I've managed to really piss off the seuss lizards

254
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,220
So I could use I could use a backup there if you want to catch up on the last couple of episodes

255
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,620
I'd love to hear your thoughts. But also we've been kicking around

256
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,540
arm as a development target and uh, all of this kind of plays into that and

257
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:18,700
I don't know wes. I feel like um, there is a change in the winds winter is coming potentially for a desktop linux

258
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,020
But oh you sweet summer child

259
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:26,140
I talk about it more in coda radius. Check it out. The coda radio program is back

260
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,300
and

261
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,560
it's

262
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,560
glorious business

263
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,940
All right

264
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,160
You know wes, um before we get into the next cloud stuff. What do you say? We just do a little spot of housekeeping

265
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,860
Yeah, let's do it it's high time in here it's kind of dusty

266
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,740
I know and you know something we should have been mentioning for a long time

267
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,340
But the jupiter broadcasting all shows feed is probably the way to go

268
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:55,260
Now if you look at it, we've kind of honed in on what jb covers and like coda radio, for example, you'd know it's back

269
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,620
It's in the all shows feed and there are things in the works

270
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,660
You don't want to miss anything new the all shows feed. You can just search for all jupiter broadcasting shows

271
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:11,740
In your podcast client or there is a link. Why waste all that time subscribing individually when it's a one stop shop also

272
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,100
Now that jupiter broadcasting is independent again

273
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:21,500
We are looking for some sponsors if you're looking to reach the perfect audience, you know, if you're out there, you know

274
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,620
This is a great audience to reach the best audience in podcasting and we have some opportunities

275
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,060
So email me chris at jupiter broadcasting dot com

276
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,100
And you may notice here on the old linux unplugged show. We try to keep the politics out

277
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,260
This is a technology area, but it is political season in the states

278
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,780
So it's never been a better time to check out unfilter unfilter dot show

279
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,580
It's not part of jupiter broadcasting so we don't talk about it here

280
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,660
But it is up and cranking to cover the people's history in real time

281
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:55,660
I'm doing live streams for each of the debates. They start 30 minutes before the debates and of course, we'll do a live stream

282
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,460
for the election night itself

283
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:05,420
All of that unfilter dot show check it out. It's back weekly and um, I think better than eva

284
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,980
Thanks, everybody who also has already joined over there and been hanging out with me in the discord

285
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,860
That was a lot of fun. We did the last debate. We're gonna do it again

286
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,100
And that's one of the nice things I like the setup. I just decided jb, you know

287
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,540
It's gonna it's got its focus and we're not gonna bring all of that stuff into it

288
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,540
So we don't that way we don't have to talk about it in the shows

289
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:28,780
We have a spot for it all the politics all of the world news all of that unfilter dot show go check it out

290
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,300
Okay, so we we had a bit of a next cloud conundrum pretty quickly

291
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:42,220
Our monthly storage bill was getting close to four hundred dollars a month and it's a pretty essential tool

292
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:46,620
It's how we pass around all of our raw recordings how we pass around our finished recordings

293
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:54,060
It's where we store our assets for things like well things like jingles like that housekeeping jingle. They're all stored in next cloud

294
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,540
Yeah, it's really integrated into the workflow at this point

295
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:04,460
And one of the things that we did when we built our last next cloud setup is we decided to base the backend storage on

296
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,460
object storage

297
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:14,640
Which allowed us to grow at infinitum, which we were intentionally doing that's how we got to like 400 gigs

298
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:21,440
Yeah, and we wanted something where we could just keep working and load it up

299
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,680
And then we could come back and clean it up and we knew that would be a job we'd have to do

300
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,400
But what was more important is that the daily productions wouldn't get held up by running out of storage

301
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,760
Which is where we'd always run into trouble with our previous

302
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:41,080
next cloud and own cloud implementations is eventually we'd run out of storage because we're constantly passing around

303
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,520
80 megabyte 100 megabyte files even larger when they're waves and video clips

304
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,920
so we needed something that wouldn't eat itself storage wise and

305
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,280
we knew at some point we'd have to come back and clean things up and

306
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,640
That is now we wanted to re-architect how we do next cloud

307
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:06,280
And what we've gone with if you'll allow the term here. I apologize ahead of time a hybrid cloud setup

308
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:11,840
I know I'm using the buzz terms. How dare you? I'm sorry Wes, but it's true

309
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,920
We've gone with the on-premises and in the cloud setup

310
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,900
And we've kind of arranged things in a way that we think is gonna work really good long term and keep the overall

311
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,760
monthly cost down and so that meant

312
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:30,840
Getting a space set up here on our local file server that runs arch that you guys will hear us talk about very often

313
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,320
It also has a next cloud instance on there

314
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,920
But there was a little bit of maintenance we had to do to get it to that point it

315
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,600
You know, it needed a little love just a bit

316
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:47,760
Yeah, and so good guy Wes came up on Sunday this last weekend

317
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:53,840
After I finished recording Linux action news Wes showed up and we had some killer food

318
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,780
Really good. I don't think I complimented you enough on the pork. It was

319
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,280
tremendous and

320
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:05,000
My wife got us some size and she got us some barbecued chicken and we sat down and we had one of those work and eat

321
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,200
Days, I mean, I think we did it in the wrong order and that we feasted first and then tried to get to work

322
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,960
But I mean we got to stuff done. We were a little sleepy

323
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,960
We had a little bit of food coma

324
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,240
But we had to we had to get the base server here in the studio ready

325
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:25,120
We had to prep it if you will so job one was take care of the base arch install before we loaded it up with

326
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,440
A bunch of data. So we set off into the Jupiter broadcasting high-security server garage

327
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,960
Okay job one is we got to prep this thing

328
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,040
So we got to do all of our due diligence make sure the OS is up to date. Uh-oh. So do that cuz it's been

329
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,040
Month or two

330
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,640
Do you just Pac-man so that way it's not all that you are too. I thought we might start there

331
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,640
So we are see what we're working against

332
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Yeah, should we replace this?

333
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,120
Package name with some other package name. Yes

334
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,560
Core something with something core other something. Oh

335
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,760
Yeah, you tell Linux libs. That's probably not important. All right

336
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,640
New kernel new Linux LTS kernel coming in excellent

337
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:15,080
So we will also have to upgrade a new wire guy. Yep. New Zia new system D

338
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,080
There's probably gonna be a ZFS update in there to new Samba

339
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,520
Big question is what about Docker? Cuz yep new doc new Docker as well

340
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,160
Cuz this is just the base OS doesn't even get us the next club funny though

341
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:36,440
547 megabyte download net upgrade size 45 megabytes. Got a little arch

342
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Shall it yeah, let's do it. I

343
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:43,040
Give us a hard time for being reckless. But in a way we were actually taking a fairly

344
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:50,560
Methodical approach here. We were first updating the base OS to make sure all of the host OS packages were up to date

345
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,520
We were on the latest version of Docker and you'll recall part of our bulletproof arch setup is this thing snapshots

346
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,920
Every time it does an upgrade and we're running now on the LTS kernel a change we made to the LTS

347
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,960
We're running now on the LTS kernel a change we made not too long ago that already pay dividends

348
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,480
This time around. Oh, yeah, and we wanted to just get all of that, right?

349
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,760
so you got to do all of that and then it's

350
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:21,480
Reboot time and you guys know how nerve-wracking this can be when you've done a big update and this one in particular

351
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,160
this one took a really really long time to shut down and then it booted up and

352
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,280
Somehow like the silent boot mode got turned back on or we never disabled it

353
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,640
And so we just sat there staring at a screen for what felt like

354
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
27 years

355
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,600
Take your 70s over there we go

356
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:55,680
I'm reminded that this is a pretty foolproof setup. We have with one major exception and that is

357
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,840
The entire OS runs off this one ten thousand rpm hard drive

358
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,480
So the data is all safe on a raid, but we have one OS drive

359
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,120
Chris you do have to factor in that we've conveniently located the OS drive on the exterior of the case for easy

360
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,400
Replacement in case that's necessary

361
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,240
Welcome to grab West. It's good to be here. Yeah

362
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,880
All right, sure turns off. Yeah, why are we going to power say oh, you know, this is one of my first LCD screens

363
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,640
I ever bought this monitors probably about 17 years old. You gotta say it's a nice aspect ratio

364
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,160
Yeah, it's the old aspect the old square aspect ratio. Yeah, it does make good for a console. It's kind of perfect. Yeah

365
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,760
All right system D firing up I see drives lighting up that's a good sign means it's probably talking ZFS

366
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,880
You're always watching for like all the signs, you know, okay drives are flashing. That's good. That's all the fans

367
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,840
They change their sound. That's a good sign. Yeah, maybe the you know, the display resolution changes and yeah, that does happen

368
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,040
You see the video driver load so it booted up. Eventually

369
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:06,480
We got the login screen and the first job for then really with this is like job two of just bringing

370
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,520
The arch server up to date now is make sure the ZFS pool mounted all our data is there

371
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,640
No, it did take a long time to reboot last time. We did this. I mean at least I come online

372
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,640
I could have to say Jim. Oh, hey

373
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,680
There we go. So I think we just we should just switch that, you know

374
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,840
We want to see the console scrolling by look at all the disk going well

375
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,840
Yeah, I thought I thought we did have that on

376
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,600
Let's log in and see if we have a sequel

377
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
I everything's online

378
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
And our containers

379
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,560
May still be loading actually, I think they're still loading

380
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,240
All right, we'll give it a minute we'll check back this next part

381
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,880
I would have messed up Wes if you weren't here

382
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,640
It was your idea that we should go kind of incrementally through the next cloud releases

383
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,480
I would have just gone whole hog to the latest version. You just love updates. I do. I just would have gone for it, but

384
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,200
You had a process you had a procedure and

385
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,560
We were ready to now tackle next cloud and get it all up-to-date

386
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:28,040
So that way we could have both the cloud version and our locally hosted version at the same exact version

387
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,240
We turn our attention to next cloud, which is

388
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,880
Version 17 dot something. It's a few releases behind

389
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,160
We want to go hands-on with this update because we want to make sure that we get this right

390
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,240
It appears we're gonna need to go in a bit of a stepped approach

391
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,280
We're gonna step up to version 18 and then to 19

392
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,920
18 and then to 19 or what has this work?

393
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,600
Yeah, sounds like you should really only go one major version at a time

394
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:00,120
At least I noticed some lines in the docs advising that I suggest we just go all the way to current but Wes wanted to be

395
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,120
careful, I know

396
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,600
So, okay

397
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,320
So if I understand we're gonna go 17 and we're gonna update to a supportive version of 17 and then to the release version

398
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,320
Whatever current version that is right now. Exactly

399
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,800
Okay

400
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,920
Let's give it a go. So first step is

401
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,920
Docker compose pull

402
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,200
You

403
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,360
You have to pull a specific. Yeah, we want to update and make sure we're grabbing the right image here

404
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,640
Okay, so how are you gonna make sure you pull the right version of this container since we're doing a pull?

405
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:37,600
Well, they've got a list of supported versions up on their github a few other places in the documentation and that includes supported Docker image releases

406
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
So we're just gonna use the tag for that version

407
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:47,360
Which is really just a simple update the YAML file make sure you've specified the exact version of the image you want and

408
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,640
You figured that out by doing what Wes? Well, I just headed over to their

409
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,780
Docker hub page and they had a big list and then they also I mean

410
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:59,420
There's a bunch of spots in their docs and on github that basically list like these are our supported releases

411
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,840
And then on the Docker hub page in particular

412
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,200
They've got a big list of all the tags that correspond if you want to use Apache or Alpine or FPM

413
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,840
You know all the various options of image flavors that they ship

414
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,560
They've basically got one for each of those for each of the supported versions

415
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:19,540
So go find the one that looks like the one you're already using except a newer version and slot that into your YAML

416
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:26,780
Yeah, and then it was just a matter of rinse and repeat we would update the Docker compose tag pull that version

417
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,880
We'd stop and start everything and then check to see if we could log in

418
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:36,520
Take it all down. Let's take it all down. Shut it all down. Oh, yeah

419
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,400
Okay

420
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:46,080
So really the only thing that's gonna have a major update is Redis because we just said pull whatever latest version of that is

421
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,120
But otherwise we've pulled tagged versions of everything

422
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,920
So now she just I say up it and leave it on the command line so we can see the output

423
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:59,920
See what happens. Yeah

424
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,440
Creating next cloud. Here we go

425
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,520
Okay

426
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,820
The check will be able to see if it loads on your phone, right

427
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,060
That's how we'll know because we didn't bring a computer out here

428
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,860
besides the server

429
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:28,340
Who needs it? Yeah, that's right out in the studio garage server room, okay

430
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,100
Configuration complete ready for startup

431
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:39,800
Set log level the debug turned on maintenance mode. We're upgrading hmm checking for app updates

432
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,160
That seems normal

433
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,940
Which seems to indicate a function in next cloud system if it's at that stage, that's a good sign

434
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:56,340
That's you, isn't it? Is that you? Oh, yeah, we can see your we can see your web browser in the debug log

435
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:03,460
You see all the stuff scrolling by is the login screen loads for Wes and we would do that each time as we step through

436
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:09,780
I think there was a mid 17 release and then the 18 release and then we had one last update to do or

437
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,760
Well, so we thought pretty confident. This is gonna work fine

438
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,300
Dang it. Why'd you say that?

439
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,260
Hahaha, did I just jinx us? All right

440
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,820
So we start her up

441
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,940
Let's do it a little console output

442
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,740
You know watching this array work away all these lights flash. It makes me kind of miss

443
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:36,300
Having that feedback aspect in my in my PC, right? You really feel it was working. Yeah, sorry

444
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,980
No way you get nothing right but with these like I know what's going on

445
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,020
Gives me a reassuring work. Okay. It looks like we're doing a

446
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:49,460
Lot of updates are these apps? It's updating. Yeah, these are up. These are it's updating a bunch of apps right now

447
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,620
That's what it's doing. Oh, well, I guess that's a good thing

448
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,640
Let's do an a code integrity check. Hey

449
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,100
Ready to handle connections

450
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,700
Break out the old test device there West. Let's see if next cloud loads

451
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,940
Come on, baby one more time. Yep

452
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,900
says update successful maintenance mode has been turned off and

453
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,540
And

454
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,580
Reset log level and it looks like it's loading pretty painless. I got to say

455
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:21,460
Every time we go through a process like this and it's pretty you know, essentially pain-free

456
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,500
I get a little more confident in next cloud, you know

457
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:28,380
So now it just needs to be like this for like another ten years and I'm gonna feel good. We'll finally be

458
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:34,740
No, actually, this is really good. Now. We just rinse repeat on the Linode version of the server. You're right

459
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,260
I mean kind of the test here is we're let's say occasional next cloud admins

460
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,460
Yeah, it's a small piece of our overall setup

461
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,940
So they doesn't get the attention that maybe it deserves right?

462
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:48,820
It's really nice for this to be simple clearly out of practice when I jinxed us and said that should be all good now

463
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,740
And because just about as we were done next cloud 20 came out

464
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,180
That timing yeah, yeah

465
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,780
But you know Wes we should talk about the bigger picture here

466
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,020
The bigger picture is what we've done is as thanks to you primarily is

467
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:10,740
We've spent the energy and time on getting both the hosted version of next cloud that's up in the cloud

468
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,660
That's costing way too much at this moment and our local version

469
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:22,500
Then you used a command to essentially use the sync system to pull a bunch of the data down from the cloud version to our local

470
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:26,380
Version, can you talk about that? Yeah next cloud CMD

471
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:33,720
I think it's called and it's just a built-in little one-shot command line client built into the standard next cloud client desktop application

472
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,120
And you don't have to have it configured for the desktop

473
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,760
I was a little worried about that since we were doing it on a mostly headless server

474
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,840
But thankfully it's arch

475
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:46,120
It was easy to get that client installed and then it accepts the credentials has got flags for it

476
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,800
Or you can do it sort of URL style, you know like user

477
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,840
Colon password at and then the HTTP address

478
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:58,560
So we just pointed that in with the right user to sync down all the stuff that we didn't want to keep up in the cloud

479
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,240
The stuff we needed to you know, we're gonna use day to day all the archival stuff

480
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,200
Well, we're just gonna move that right into the garage. And so we set up that sink

481
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,700
I think it was about

482
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,040
120 gigs of stuff or so

483
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,400
Yeah

484
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,240
And then it was a matter of cleaning up the cloud instance and you have to then

485
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,180
At least if you want to reclaim that space immediately

486
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,280
You need to run a command on the command line to essentially delete everything permanently

487
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:27,240
Yeah, you know you there's various setups the next cloud for keeping multiple versions hanging around and then also sort of defaults around like how long

488
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,360
Is stuff gonna be in the trash? When does it get expired out of there and just the trash get cleaned up?

489
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,720
So we just ran some commands in the command line

490
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,720
Inside the Docker container with the OCC command to just sort of clean all that up delete anything that anyone had in the trash

491
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:47,120
Delete any old versions hanging around and see how small we could get things and what we got it down to what like 30

492
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,780
40 gigs now, I think it's I think it's more like 50

493
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,000
But it was you know

494
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,120
Pretty good and that includes anything all the various users have uploaded as well as our sort of working team folder

495
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:04,200
Right and before we did the purge and moved everything down it was getting north of I mean because of all the undelete files

496
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,900
I think it was somewhere north of three four hundred gigabytes. It was getting pretty big. It was over 400 gigs

497
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:14,140
Yes, was it? Okay. Yeah, and that's why the cost was getting there so high and we knew that would eventually be an issue

498
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:19,960
And so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna just kind of rework our workflow a bit and only keep certain folders up in

499
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,960
The cloud and keep everything else

500
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:29,060
Locally and there's a lot of ways we can make that available to our users from Federation to just having two separate URLs

501
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,340
but

502
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:37,440
What really I think was nice here is that the next cloud project is publishing these Docker images

503
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,120
themselves and as a result they've taken the time to

504
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,840
note which ones are stable releases and they've given you instructions on which tags to use and

505
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,680
You can just tell it's a it's a first-class distribution

506
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:59,640
method for the project and I think that gave me kind of a sense of confidence in the method we're using to deploy next

507
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,900
cloud and

508
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:07,720
we also as part of this are moving from a digital ocean droplet to a Linode server and I

509
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:13,280
Don't know how much can we talk about that Wes because that's a tricky process since we're moving from object storage at

510
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:19,400
Do to object storage at the node? Yeah, and while the object storage has been handy

511
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,160
You know, it does have some tricks of its own one

512
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,440
It's not really like a regular file system and to the way it's set up with the way we're doing it next cloud currently

513
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,840
You don't have any of the regular file structure

514
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,560
that's all kept in the database and you just get a bunch of files with sort of

515
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,920
Database IDs for names all in one giant flat folder

516
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,840
So that's a little unintuitive at least at first and doesn't kind of match up exactly with how you have it stored regularly on disk

517
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:50,520
Right. So kind of step one is like we got to sync all that data from our previous s3 compatible storage provider over to our new

518
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:55,040
Yeah, and there's a couple of ways to do that, but there is specifically like an s3

519
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:01,920
Arcing compatible client right? Well, we're just using our clone which is so handy a great tool in general

520
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,520
I know it's a favorite over at self-hosted as well because it's so nice for interfacing with all kinds of different cloud

521
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,240
Clients and they've even got a very nice little home

522
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,600
Configuration CLI interface too. So if you're not familiar with the dot files and config, it'll walk you through that

523
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,760
You can choose who your provider is

524
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,080
They've got a lot of default support and then just enter your credentials right there as it prompts you nice

525
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:28,200
Yeah, our clones a great little way to also back up a website from the command line to say a Dropbox or Google Drive

526
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,000
As well, there's a couple of options there

527
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
So where are you going to use our clone to take data from one set of object storage to another set of object storage?

528
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,680
So that'll be the data back in and then it's a matter of moving the config which includes the docker compose and anywhere

529
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,520
that the docker

530
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:51,280
Composes set up to bind to for data and configuration. We'll have to make sure that we have similar mount points on the new host

531
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:58,640
We'll pull down the docker image and hopefully it'll connect to its previous configuration. It'll connect to the storage with new updated

532
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,880
object storage

533
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:07,880
URLs and in theory turn on although we're waiting to actually do it until this shows out because we don't want to screw things up

534
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,300
But we're ready. Well, and there's one more piece there, you know over a digital ocean

535
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,480
We were using a managed database, but we're gonna switch that, you know, we're not using this next cloud

536
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,560
We're using it for less stuff. So we're just gonna run a Postgres database locally on the host

537
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:27,280
So we've got to stand one of those up and make sure we've exported the database from the previous database host and move it over

538
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,040
Right, right the database part. We were going with the hosted solution

539
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,240
Which also will be a little bit of a cost savings and then that's an area where we're doing it kind of differently

540
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,120
We're doing a different implementation in our local LAN setup of next cloud

541
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,680
But it's all just implementation details at the end of the day the end users just see next cloud

542
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:53,640
And so I imagine we'll probably stay around the 50 60 gig range on our cloud version and we'll probably keep about 125 gigs

543
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,400
Or so and growing here on the archive version

544
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,280
Yeah, and you know now we've kind of worked out as well if we need to do occasional, you know

545
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,640
We've crewed a bunch of stuff up in the in the hosted version and need to move that down

546
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,160
We've got that workflow figured out

547
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:12,320
But here's what I kind of walked away with and I want to pass on to the audience if you're thinking about next cloud

548
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:18,960
Or how you might rearchitect your next cloud. I'm really happy with this setup. We've used it for over a year now and

549
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,880
Even when we kind of let things slip because well, honestly, we've been busy with a lot of things recently

550
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,160
It's been really crazy

551
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:31,760
And so next cloud just didn't get updated for a few releases and our data grew and more and more than it should

552
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,480
Yeah

553
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,800
And I think what I walked away with is not only did we learn how to do it better

554
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,600
But the setup with running next cloud in a container with using object storage with creating

555
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,360
These two different versions with an archive version and a cloud version

556
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,120
That is super fast and accessible to our team that works around the world

557
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,680
You know, that's one of the great advantages of the cloud version

558
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:00,000
But our long-term storage on a local more cost-effective storage medium is great for archival purposes

559
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,720
And also the requirements of that data just aren't as extreme

560
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,400
You know our editors aren't trying to download and upload those files as fast as possible

561
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,280
And that that combination I know it sounds crazy

562
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:15,920
But two next cloud servers when you're managing via containers and your storage back end is super flexible

563
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,080
Has been a bulletproof next cloud setup

564
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:27,760
We went from 17 to 17 and a half to 18 to 19 and now to 20 in a real relatively problem-free progression

565
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,400
It really wasn't very much trouble and we have modified these next cloud instances

566
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,000
We've themed them. We've installed a fair amount of apps. We use them quite a bit

567
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,640
There's a lot of storage there. There's a large database to track all of it

568
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,800
I mean you name it

569
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,480
We've put this thing through its paces

570
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,480
Yeah, and I mean it's been pretty good

571
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:50,080
Yeah, and I mean it's been pretty darn reliable even without us giving it as much care and attention as it might need

572
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:54,720
Which I think we touched on a little bit in the clips, which is yeah, we're occasional next cloud admins

573
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,080
We don't use it for all of the features. It has which are a lot impressively a lot these days

574
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,360
We're mostly just using it as a nice ui on some and some file syncing, but even there, you know

575
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,760
We can ignore it and it just keeps working

576
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,600
I mean, it sounds like hyperbole, but I really feel like this might be the perfect next cloud setup

577
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,680
Yeah, it is. It is pretty nice and especially coming as the casual sort of, you know

578
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,240
We got to do updates and oh gosh, we got to move this thing

579
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,880
It's nice not having to deal with as much

580
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,560
Miscellaneous system state, you know, it's at least constrained

581
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,280
We might not know everything about the ins and outs of how next cloud works or might have forgotten it since the last time

582
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,280
That we had to do a lot with next cloud

583
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,600
But there's a limit to how complicated it can be because it's just all containerized

584
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,720
We've got container images. We've got volumes and we've got a database and then, you know a whole bunch of files

585
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,120
But that's it. It's just some fundamental components and as long as we can deal with each of those

586
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,560
It's not that complicated xml in the chat room is asking. So what's the cost update now?

587
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,840
Well, we don't really know because we went from like nearly well, so I said over 400 gigs to

588
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,000
Like 40 or we're going to be around 50 gigs when we're all done

589
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,040
I just don't really know what that cost savings is because then at the same time

590
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,320
We're going to transition from do to lanode and so there'll be you know, just a different pricing structure there

591
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,360
So we'll give you an update after we've done it for a little bit

592
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,240
I say go forth. This is a linux unplugged approved a setup boom

593
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,520
it does look like you know if we were staying at do it would be significantly cheaper because I think that by default the

594
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:27,680
Spaces are about five dollars per month up to 250 gigs. So ours was going up because we'd sort of exceeded that

595
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,120
That's a pretty comfortable ceiling where we're at now though. Ah, yeah. Yeah, i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure it would be

596
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,080
I want to say a big. Thank you to our

597
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:41,860
Unplugged core contributors if you want to become a member of the show and get two

598
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,300
Special versions made available to you go to unplugged core.com

599
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:53,060
Not only do you help keep the show independent and keep an audience focused but we give a little thank you to you

600
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,100
There's two perks really for the membership when you become a contributor

601
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,580
You'll get an option for two different feeds and I guess in theory

602
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:04,900
If you're a maniac you could subscribe to both of them nothing's stopping you but I I guess I always envisioned you'd select one of them

603
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,900
Feed one is a limited ad

604
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,780
version of the show same full production

605
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,340
Just no ads

606
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,140
Tight sounds good easy to listen to while you're commuting

607
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:20,420
That's a great one. If you like the show a lot, but maybe just don't love the ads great feed

608
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:24,660
But if you have maybe a longer commute or you want more content

609
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:29,620
Even if it's not always 100 on topic or you want to just kind of feel like you're hanging out with the gang

610
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:34,280
We also make the full live stream available all of our screw-ups

611
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:40,360
The stuff that we cut from the show, which sometimes actual there's plenty. Yeah, like sometimes, you know

612
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,360
We try to keep the thing at a certain run length

613
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,720
And if I yap on too long we cut some of that stuff or anybody

614
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:52,760
Yaps too much we cut that but it's in the full live stream all our screw-ups everything that never made into the show plus the entire

615
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:57,400
pre and post show which is basically like a never show that is it like a whole nother show that

616
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,480
Never gets released

617
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:05,080
And it's just a thank you to those who help keep the show independent to keep us going unplugged core.com

618
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,960
We're about 60 of the way to a single sponsor like how much we'd make from a single sponsor in the show

619
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,400
That's really great. I mean i'm very happy with that. So thank you

620
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:20,440
I'd love one day to get that to 100 maybe and we'll just keep delivering. We'll just keep trying to earn that so

621
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,240
Uh, maybe you change your mind if you haven't done it yet, or if you can't we totally appreciate you just listening

622
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:31,640
Maybe take advantage of our sponsors when they work for you or maybe share the show with somebody. We really appreciate that

623
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,000
We're just glad you're listening. We just appreciate you sharing the show all of that

624
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,240
Even if you can't contribute financially, but if you can

625
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:41,160
You can then I think you know that this is a good investment. This is a good bet

626
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,260
unplugged core.com

627
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,320
Okay, wes

628
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:53,480
I've been promised that we have an email that presents the last text editor that we'll ever use

629
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:58,440
Should we get to it? Yeah, we probably should although actually this one came from our telegram group

630
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,160
Which is another place you can ping us with feedback

631
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,000
Although email is a little easier to sneak into the show with look at you

632
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,280
You took somebody and you put it all up into a slexy.org document here and uh made it like an email for me

633
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:15,800
I know how much you love talking about text editors. See what i'm saying. Yeah, you guys see what i'm saying about this wes, right?

634
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,480
You see what i'm saying. All right. Well, so jitty wrote in telegram lately

635
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:25,960
You've been mentioning text editors and listing some pics for editors on lup. He thinks perhaps i'm trying to replace nano

636
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,440
I assure you that is not the case

637
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,800
He says he goes on to say or they go on to say

638
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:38,040
I heard you praise nano on the latest episode who me no never which I use until I found

639
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:42,680
Micro it's probably the last terminal text editor you'll ever use

640
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:48,120
Very sane and easy to figure out with default hockey syntax highlighting right out of the box

641
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:53,080
And mouse support. It's kind of what nano should have been and it's written in go

642
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:56,120
I was surprised micro didn't come up even in conversation on lup

643
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:02,120
Also, I should add micro has a hotkey that exposes a host of other very powerful options

644
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:08,200
Which basically gives you a cross between vim and nano overall the best feature though in my opinion

645
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,720
Is the prompt that asks you if you meant to edit a file with sudo?

646
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:18,280
Which then runs sudo if you answer yes. Okay, that actually seriously sounds great. Jitty syntax highlighting

647
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,120
key combos similar to nano and vim and

648
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,360
That problem where I am I edit a file that I meant to do with sudo

649
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:30,600
But I just forgot that time and then I have to jump out is so frustrating

650
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,640
That uh, I think I might switch to micro

651
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:39,800
Wow, good work. Jitty, you know, this does look pretty nice. There's a ton of different editors, but that it's

652
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,480
Go means it should be fairly simple for you to get on your system and set up

653
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,560
And it does seem like it might be kind of a sweet spot for you chris where it's got some niceties

654
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:53,960
You know, maybe you're editing a random, um, you know a random configuration file some yaml something where some syntax highlighting will come in handy

655
00:49:54,200 --> 00:50:01,160
But you obviously don't need all the complicated stuff in vs code or vim or something more full featured if it's just on a random server machine

656
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,040
Yeah, especially if you need something that's on the command line

657
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:09,400
Um, you want to take a shot at the pronunciation of this next one, you know, I think that's rain

658
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:15,640
Writing to us about the next generation of linux users. Yeah rain writes in the previous episode 372

659
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,680
You talked about the distro triforce and the next generation of linux users happily enough

660
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,520
I am one of them. So I thought i'd write in what a great idea

661
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,720
Uh, they go on to say i'm obviously still very new to linux

662
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:34,840
But I already am sticking to one distribution as I want things to work on my only school laptop just as predicted

663
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:40,760
During the show, um, which they say it was already quite difficult to convince my parents to let me use linux, by the way

664
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,760
But i'm currently using fedora

665
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,360
Uh, and I like the idea of dependencies thoroughly being checked

666
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,800
So, uh, that's pretty great listening to the show live and uh p.s

667
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:58,840
I'm looking forward to ms edge on linux as I currently have four different microsoft accounts for education and they're held to manage in a single browser

668
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,480
You know, that's the second bit of feedback

669
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:06,200
We got since last week where they where somebody's looking forward to edge on linux for various different use cases

670
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:11,800
I guess at this point I am too. Really? No, not really. I am just curious. It's been so long

671
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,880
It's interesting that they're you know, actually making it over to the linux world

672
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,200
I want to see what it looks like

673
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:23,800
Jordan writes in with the next cloud to-do system mentioned which kind of went well with today's, uh topic

674
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:29,400
Jordan writes. I recently finished sorting out a to-do list system for the wife and myself and I thought i'd throw it out there

675
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:34,600
The system has to be pretty cross-platform because my wife has an iphone and I have an android phone

676
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,400
And while we both use ubuntu on our laptops. I primarily use an imac at work

677
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,840
Oh, and well, I have a pine phone a pine tab and a pine book pro

678
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,840
So, you know i'm kind of all over the place and i'm trying to figure out how i'm going to do that

679
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,320
Kind of all over the place and I like to get work done on those too

680
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,760
The actual functionality we need out of such a system is really quite minimal

681
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,920
I think shared grocery list and you know a couple items with some due dates

682
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:03,720
Other characteristics are open source integration with the operating system and well no more web apps if possible

683
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:08,540
Nextcloud's cal dev based task apps fills out these requirements

684
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:16,540
Nicely it integrates with the reminders app on macos and ios and gnomes to do app through the internet online account setup

685
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:25,260
Without requiring any additional software on android. It's a bit more involved namely the next cloud app dav x5 and task.org

686
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,100
Which is a lot you have to put it all together, but it really isn't too bad

687
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,260
It kind of goes off the rails when you go from there

688
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:38,620
But the primary drawbacks are really the reminders app on both ios and macos lack support for subtasks and the kanban

689
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,300
Style boards like to do us now supports those aren't possible

690
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:45,900
but jordan says try out nextcloud to do system it could be the way to go and

691
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:49,580
I know I think I remember cheese mentioned he uses it drew

692
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:55,740
Do you use any kind of task management system or any of these things built into nextcloud? Uh, not in nextcloud

693
00:52:55,740 --> 00:53:02,060
I just use google tasks. Oh, yeah, that's right. You're a google task guy, which does integrate with gnome to do

694
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:07,260
Just fyi, right? I was just going to mention that it does look at that. Yeah

695
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:12,620
James says should I be using memberful? I just signed up for patreon by is that a mistake?

696
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,780
I'm confused between patreon and memorable

697
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:21,740
So memorable is the white label service that we use for the core contributors. So if you want to support the show directly

698
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,120
That's where you become a core contributor unplugged core.com

699
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:30,320
If you want to support the network productions, that's where jupiter signal or the patreon comes in

700
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:36,240
I am frustrated that wes and I burned a lot of hours on that sunday that we talked about

701
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:42,720
Because I screwed up. I thought I could I thought I was gonna be able to offer a bundle of all of the membership shows

702
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:46,400
To the patrons. I'm still working on a solution for that

703
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,200
I thought i'd have it by now, but i'm trying to come up with something

704
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:54,160
It may end up being a substantial discount for a bundle. I'm not sure what it's

705
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,080
It's so much more stupid complicated than you'd think that's for sure

706
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:02,160
And then of course, we want to tie all of it into our automation system and production. So that way

707
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,280
Things go out on time for everybody when we release episodes and all of it. So it's a it's

708
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,040
It's a lot of a lot of layers to this dip but right now

709
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:16,640
In terms of just supporting the network helping us go independent keeping us going

710
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:22,560
There's really two avenues you can you can support your favorite show memberships and really appreciate that

711
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:27,360
And or you can support the entire network and that's done at jupiter signal now

712
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,080
That kind of goes towards future productions

713
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:35,280
Maybe shows that don't have sponsors that need to run for a while until a sponsor can land on them like

714
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,080
Which is currently the case for linux action news

715
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,880
That kind of thing the patreon enables it's not nearly enough revenue

716
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,960
But it's sort of like an emergency budget that we we have access to

717
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,120
And then if the revenues increase from there then we can leverage it for other things

718
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,560
But that's what we use right now

719
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:57,040
So we use patreon for to support the entire network productions at patreon.com slash jupiter signal

720
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,840
And then our individual shows have membership programs not all of them, but some of them

721
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,840
Those are linked at their respective websites like ours for examples

722
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,400
Is like we mentioned the uh core contributors at unpluggedcore.com

723
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,440
And uh, I just am very grateful for anybody who sticks in there, you know, one of the great things

724
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:22,400
About these shows is they are a regular reoccurring thing that happens in the community

725
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,960
You know, you can set your watch to them

726
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:29,840
And it allows for like-minded people to come together and talk about something

727
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:36,480
That has only really gotten better, right in 2020 has has brought a lot of bad things but

728
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:40,400
Linux and open source and free software is all still pretty great

729
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:46,880
And we really have a pretty smart sharp welcoming community. And so it's not just keeping the shows going but

730
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:54,160
It's also about creating that welcoming community for everyone and the rallying around that and you know, it's been a wild year

731
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,720
So I just really appreciate everybody's support

732
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:02,160
It's really been something wess. Um, why don't we do one pick and then we get the heck out of here? What do you say?

733
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,360
Oh boy throwing a wild pick out there. All right. What do you like?

734
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:11,120
Well, I know you've been talking about this file converter pick you kind of were hemming and hawing that that didn't get picked last time

735
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,840
Should we throw that one out there? Yeah, okay

736
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:20,640
File converter, you know, this is interesting because it's something we don't talk about on this show very much but sneaks into coder radio

737
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,220
Uh, and that's our friend web assembly. Someone took ffmpeg

738
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,840
Compiled it with web assembly and stuck it up on the web for you to use file converter. Digital

739
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:38,480
You upload your file, then you select your conversion type and then they're just throwing cpu power at this and it converts to a lot

740
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:44,480
Of stuff this must be up on github, right? Like we could grab this and host it ourselves possibly. Well, that's a good idea

741
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:50,000
Yeah, because this can't last forever, but this is a great idea. It looks really clean and simple

742
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,280
Give it a go if you need to convert a quick file file converter digital

743
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,400
It's been a while since we've had a website pick how westpain

744
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,520
Oh, and it makes me think of maybe um, you know things like web assembly. I'm not i'm not saying it's the best approach or

745
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:05,040
Even saying you should use it, but it's interesting to see and take some of these, you know

746
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:09,440
Very useful command line apps that you might otherwise have to go spin up a linux server

747
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,600
Learn how to use from the command line and instead just ship them right to the browser

759
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:08,400
It uses the high-tech power of a google calendar in bed. I think I did

760
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,280
70 years ago

Links to everything we talked about today linux unplugged.com

766
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,800
374 thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the unplugged program

767

And we'll see you right back here

768
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:46,500
next tuesday

769
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:05,520
So

770
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:20,160
Not a huge fan of the new next cloud 20 ui. Have you seen this true? I haven't no

771
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,800
It's like what would you call it a dashboard goat? You should probably look it up next cloud 20 new

772
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,880
It looks like kubernetes

773
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,320
Oh does it?

774
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,760
I totally get what they're going for

775
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:35,520
And if I used like all of the features of next cloud, it would be kind of nice to have like an outlook style

776
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:42,880
Today screen I do think there is there is use to it. But because I primarily use it as a means of file storage

777
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,320
It kind of just slows me down. It kind of just kind of it's one more thing

778
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:51,040
I have to dismiss it. Maybe I can turn it off. You're supposed to figure out how to actually do something in it

779
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:55,360
There are no clues no hints about what you're supposed to do once you're in the ui

780
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,920
You can get past it pretty quick. You probably can turn it off. I may even be able to customize it

781
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:04,080
Uh, but for me what I really want is I know if anybody knows how to do this

782
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:09,520
Is i'd like to set my home screen to be several folders deep into our into our team folder

783
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:14,640
That would be perfect for me. I only ever go into the web interface

784
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,280
Uh very very rarely

785
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,960
mostly because one i'm syncing to my desktop and

786
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,920
And two when I need things that are in there that are synced I can just

787
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:33,120
Log in using the gnome interface and it's right there in my file browser. So that is a nice thing

788
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,680
That is another nice reason to set it up. I'm never

789
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:49,780
In here like in the web interface unless I have to share it to somebody well because the web interface sucks
