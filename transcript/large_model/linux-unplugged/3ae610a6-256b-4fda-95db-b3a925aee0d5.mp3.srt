1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
Holy smokes, Wes, look alive.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,040
It's perfect timing for Linux Unplugged today.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,140
We are going to be getting into a conversation around different methods of crowdfunding open

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,880
source projects, and one of the titans of Kickstarter has launched their brand new Kickstarter

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,300
project today.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,200
They're not struggling, though, Wes.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:28,760
They have already raised, of a goal of a million, four million, oh boy, 22,000 backers with

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,720
36 days left to go.

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,760
They're only a few hours into this thing.

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,560
It's the new Pebble 2, Time 2, and the Pebble Core.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,800
Hey, Kickstarter.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
We're Pebble.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Hey there.

14
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,120
In 2012, we came to you with an idea called a smartwatch.

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,320
Your incredible support helped Pebble smash Kickstarter records not once, but twice, and

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,880
ushered in a revolution in wearable technology.

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,120
OMG, OMG, OMG.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,080
Today, we've come home to Kickstarter to push these boundaries even further.

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:04,400
Introducing Pebble 2, a sporty, ultra-affordable smartwatch with a built-in heart rate monitor.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,800
Time 2, a premium smartwatch for the active professional, and Pebble Core, an entirely

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,000
new device for runners that connects to your cellular network and fits in the palm of your

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
hand.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hey, gang.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's time to write the next chapter in wearables.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Am I part of gang?

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I want to be in the gang.

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,320
Yeah, we're in the gang, dude.

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,540
Pebble 2 is our latest smartwatch, now with built-in activity tracking.

29
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,920
So they got the new watch, now hold on, because this isn't the one you're interested in.

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,180
But it's neat that it has real-time heart rate all the time.

31
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,180
It's waterproof.

32
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,040
It does microphones so you can do dictation.

33
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
That's all neat.

34
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
But oh boy.

35
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,740
And with a single click, Pebble 2 is an all-around amazing smartwatch.

36
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,640
And starting at just $99, it's the most affordable smartwatch ever.

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,800
All right, so that's the Pebble 2.

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
But now...

39
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,800
We're excited to announce Time 2, our all-new premium full-color smartwatch.

40
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,440
Machined from marine-grade stainless steel in gold, black, or silver, Time 2 introduces

41
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:08,400
a crisp new color e-paper display that's 53% larger than the original and packs twice the

42
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,320
text on screen, keeping you up to date at a glance.

43
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,000
Time 2's battery lasts up to 10 whole days on a single charge.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,640
Now that is amazing.

45
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
10 days?

46
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
Wow.

47
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,840
And like Pebble 2, it has a mic, heart rate monitor, and is water-resistant to 30 meters.

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,160
Both watches also feature an updated version of Pebble Health.

49
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,900
Now you can tell Pebble your activity and fitness goals, and it sets targets that automatically

50
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,040
adjust based on your performance.

51
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,080
Now they also have the new Pebble Core, which is basically just a voice-activated push-button

52
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,960
little activity tracker.

53
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,960
Pebble's getting big into fitness, huge into fitness.

54
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,160
So you could leave your phone at home.

55
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,680
I like that.

56
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,600
Core streams music from Spotify to keep you motivated.

57
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,240
So that's kind of a neat thing.

58
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,880
So we're going to be talking about this today, and not necessarily the Pebble, but I think

59
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,520
it's really interesting timing for some of the subjects we're getting into, Wes.

60
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,520
Are you ready to get started?

61
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,740
Oh yeah.

62
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:16,360
This is Linux Unplugged episode 146 for May 24, 2016.

63
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:28,440
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's skipping pebbles into

64
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,680
the body of water that is our Mumble Room.

65
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,680
My name is Chris.

66
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,680
My name is Wes.

67
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
Was that profound, Wes?

68
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,040
I'm not going to pretend that made sense, but let's just keep going.

69
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,200
The body of water.

70
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,600
I also liked Rekai's fighting the Windows 10 upgrade menace.

71
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,600
Oh, much better.

72
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,840
Yeah, stay tuned for the Poe Show for more on that.

73
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,400
Coming up on today's episode of the Unplugged program, we are going to talk a little bit

74
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,360
about funding open source projects, but in a new light, in something we've never really

75
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,760
done before, in projects that have a bit of a name and a bit of a reputation, good and

76
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,760
bad.

77
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,880
We're going to start with the Mycroft project today, which is delivering some actual software,

78
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,920
which we have loaded there and HamRadio has been trying out, but we're also going to talk

79
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,600
about Purism.

80
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,520
They have a new initiative, a new piece of hardware.

81
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,160
They claim it is the Microsoft Surface for those of you who respect your privacy and

82
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
freedom.

83
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Big promises.

84
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,320
But can we rely on Purism to deliver a product like this when you could argue they haven't

85
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,560
even mastered the last product they launched?

86
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,560
As you can imagine, I have thoughts on this topic, so we'll be discussing that coming

87
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,560
up in the show.

88
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,520
But before all of that, Wes, before all of that, we have some great open source project

89
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
updates.

90
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,520
How did you get all these links this week?

91
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,960
Like, this was a Wes blowout.

92
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
They've just fallen out of the sky.

93
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
You were blowing it out, this.

94
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
You were just blowing it out, Wes.

95
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
Just blowing it out.

96
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,800
Speaking of blowing it out, you were blowing it out with the beer, too.

97
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,420
Well, hopefully you won't be blowing it out.

98
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,840
It's a delicious beer, and I...

99
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,520
We have to restrain ourselves, Chris.

100
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,920
Once again, you have managed to bring a beer into the Unplugged program.

101
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,640
This is from a local brewery that I've never heard of.

102
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,200
Sneaking it in under your radar.

103
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,480
Copper Donkey.

104
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,160
Copper Donkey from the No Lee, I think is how you say it.

105
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
No Lie?

106
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
Probably, probably.

107
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,160
It's L-I.

108
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
L-I.

109
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
I don't know.

110
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,600
It is... Oh, it's a good beer, though.

111
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
It's kind of new.

112
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,920
It's from a new brewery they launched just a year ago.

113
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,360
And it is also fairly strong at 8%.

114
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,000
They're doing a good job already.

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,120
So Wes brought us a couple of pints.

116
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,760
So we'll be drinking that on today's program, drinking along with you, water, beer, whatever

117
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,160
your beverage of choice is.

118
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
Let's bring in that Mamba Room.

119
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,160
Time of property greetings, Mamba Room.

120
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
Greetings, users.

121
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
Greetings.

122
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,160
I've never installed Gnome slash Linux.

123
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,160
Hi, hi.

124
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Wow.

125
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,920
That is a huge turn in.

126
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,920
I think I even heard some Richard Stallman in there.

127
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
That is unbelievable.

128
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
Oh, you guys.

129
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,360
Oh, jeez, Louise.

130
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,800
Okay, so I want to talk about this one just really quick.

131
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,960
Well, there's a plane flying overhead right now.

132
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
Wes, do you hear that?

133
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
I do.

134
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,280
Our friends from the south, Mr. Bowen.

135
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,040
So maybe it's somebody from this new project to come here to talk to us in person because

136
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,080
it could be a big deal.

137
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,980
You may have heard it before, formerly known, the artist formerly known as XDG App is now

138
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:12,960
Flapjack with a brand new fancy website at Flap or Flat Pack, not Flapjack.

139
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,240
Although I got to imagine, if you think about it, Flapjack is a good metaphor here.

140
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,160
Yeah, I picture stacking individual delicious pancakes on top of each other that don't necessarily

141
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,780
connect until I take my delicious butter and syrup and I mash my fork down in between them

142
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,680
and then bring them all together with my fork stab and put them in my mouth, hence installing

143
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
software.

144
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,480
This is why Chris is not a software architect.

145
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,600
No, but they should just talk to me first because I think if they would talk to me-

146
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
That's a great breakfast bar though.

147
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,560
Because, you know, they're going for those Ikea easy to pack things, but I'm telling

148
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,360
you a pancakes might just play a little better.

149
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,120
Anyways, Flat Pack is the future of application distribution, according to them.

150
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,880
The days of chasing multiple Linux distributions are over.

151
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,960
You hear that playing with?

152
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,840
Standalone apps for Linux are here, self-contained and future proof.

153
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,080
Distributing applications on Linux is a pain.

154
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,080
Different distributions-

155
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,360
Don't we know it.

156
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,760
Different distros, multiple versions, each with their own versions of libraries, but

157
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,800
Flat Pack is here to change all of that.

158
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,160
It's cross-platform, it's stable, and it's secure.

159
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,680
So you've, you know, another thing you've heard of in another way.

160
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,220
So XEG apps, you've also probably heard this referred to a sandbox apps to make it possible

161
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,480
for third parties to distribute applications.

162
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,560
We talked with someone from the known project in Linux action show about this in our Linux

163
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,480
Fest Northwest coverage.

164
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,520
I don't know Wes, they have a demo here.

165
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,360
I think they're really close to shipping it.

166
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,920
It almost feels like it's now in that spot where is anybody going to ever adopt this?

167
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,120
That's what's going to matter here.

168
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
We have that.

169
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
We have a app image.

170
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,200
Mumble of many thoughts on anyone ever adopting this.

171
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,540
Will it actually take off?

172
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,340
Will upstream packages embrace this?

173
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,440
I think no, we're going to embrace it quite heavily.

174
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,080
I mean, they're the ones really pushing this.

175
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,440
It's their runtime that's doing all the flat pack stuff right now.

176
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,440
The sticking point for me is still the inefficiency of it.

177
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,760
Like I don't want to have 20 copies of the known runtime for my 20 different flat pack

178
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
apps.

179
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
Yeah.

180
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,800
Do you see a way around that though and trying to accomplish what they're accomplishing?

181
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,160
I don't, but I think the use case of where they're trying to accomplish it, you know,

182
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,040
it might be a case of just needing that niche of, it's the same niche that's kind of taken

183
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,160
out by rolling releases.

184
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,100
So if I kind of think with my tumbleweed hat, it's like, yeah, I don't care.

185
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:40,080
If I think with my leap hat on though, yeah, I can see us bundling up flat pack apps and

186
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,000
pushing out shiny and new versions of known maps when previously that would be like a

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,120
complete and utter no no.

188
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Yeah.

189
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,480
They have right now on their page, they have nightly builds of GIMP, Inkscape, Darktable,

190
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:58,180
MyPaint and Scribulous, and they're working on stable builds of the known core applications.

191
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,520
The other thing we have to keep in mind is at the same time this is happening, Canonical

192
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:08,240
has their own solution, which is snap packages, which is sort of a similar solution for their

193
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,160
specific platform.

194
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,560
And I wonder if that's going to be sort of a duplication of effort on some levels.

195
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:23,280
For example, if the Gnome desktop could be bundled up as a snap package, then what about

196
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,720
also bundling up as a flat pack?

197
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,840
Is who's going to do that work?

198
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,520
I think flat pack has way more going for it because they're trying to be cross distro

199
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,600
because they're working with all these other other projects, other distros that then, you

200
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
know, it's known.

201
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,280
They don't just think about themselves.

202
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,960
Whereas Ubuntu is going to work fine on Ubuntu, but is it going to work anywhere else?

203
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:52,080
But I think if you I see I would tend to agree with you, except if you look at the way history

204
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,040
has played out when it comes to just packaging up installation packages for distributions,

205
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,880
you see very much very much like in terms of people will go out of their way to package

206
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,560
up for Ubuntu and in a lot of cases, just Ubuntu.

207
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,320
Yeah, that's true.

208
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,040
And that feels like the same thing.

209
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,360
Maybe they're just going to focus on snap packages instead of flat packs.

210
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,640
I look at you know, I look at there's there's projects out there that we are all familiar

211
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,640
with that will soon be repackaged individual components in the entire desktop as snap packages.

212
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,600
They're working on it right now.

213
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,720
And I don't think they're working on flat packs.

214
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,080
That's the thing is the projects I'm thinking of, I already know are working on snap versions,

215
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,120
and I don't know they're working on anything else.

216
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:42,120
But doesn't that kind of like erode the whole cross distro, you know, appeal?

217
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:49,720
I mean, the appeal of a flat pack is you do it once and it will work on every distro plus

218
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
Ubuntu.

219
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
Yeah, I agree.

220
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,280
I mean, if you apply it so much to snap packet packages right now, the only people interested

221
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,040
in snap packages are Ubuntu.

222
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,560
It's like you might as well just do it Ubuntu dev.

223
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,880
I completely agree.

224
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,680
I just I worry that the problem is the people that are making these decisions are idiots

225
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
or something.

226
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,680
I don't know why.

227
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,360
I mean, today, I couldn't tell you why so many of them only package for Ubuntu.

228
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,800
I mean, I could it's market share related, but that might just be what pushes them to

229
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
use snap packages.

230
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
I don't know.

231
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,960
It's probably you're right.

232
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,640
Because flat pack includes Ubuntu, you hope that gives it the nudge ahead.

233
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,920
That just means people will and if they can get behind the mind, if they can get mind

234
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
share out there.

235
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,320
And the other issue is Canonical has some momentum behind mind share already.

236
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,480
And they just the ability to promote a little bit better as a company that has resources

237
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,800
to do so and avenues to do so.

238
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,640
And if they can have a good, you know, they can be like, hey, look, have the shiny apps

239
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,160
user base that's already going to install 1604, then they might have a good in road

240
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,560
to actually get people using it.

241
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,360
You can get you can try that right now, though.

242
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,360
It's out there.

243
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:57,400
So I really want to talk about today just so that we sort of have flat pack now on our

244
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
radar instead of XD.

245
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,800
I guess it'll probably depend to like how easy is it to create one or the other?

246
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
Yeah.

247
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,640
How well will they integrate into different build tools or build change that people are

248
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
already using?

249
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
I'm listening to that right now.

250
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,080
It might be worth playing with.

251
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,480
You'd be like, hey, Mike, just target this and go.

252
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,760
I actually like the idea of flat pack and snaps just because I don't have to worry about,

253
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,800
you know, whenever I update my system or right now that I'm on 1510 and like 20 apps that

254
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,880
I want to try, I can't even get yet.

255
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
I agree.

256
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,320
I think it makes the I think it makes long term support and enterprise distros way more

257
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,560
viable to if you can get more modern applications and have a nice stable base.

258
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,960
I think that's going to be really sweet.

259
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,400
What do you what do you think, Wes?

260
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,800
So the chat room is asking, why not?

261
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
Why not app image?

262
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,480
Why are we why are we not just app image is already a thing.

263
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,920
There's already project shipping with app images.

264
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,000
Why don't we just use an app image, Wes?

265
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,280
It seems like it's going to be the same thing.

266
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,960
It's going to come back to adoption.

267
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,120
And there are a few people like subsurface obviously thinks it's great.

268
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,040
And I don't know, I haven't made an app.

269
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,600
So I guess it would come back to like, how easy is it to integrate into existing build

270
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
systems?

271
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,400
How, how hard is it to just go from packaging for distros already and having it ship in

272
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
one of these packages?

273
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,480
You know, if Ubuntu provides a really good thing where hey, you're making a dab already,

274
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,600
bam, now you have your snap package, then that would be really nice if it's harder to

275
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,120
make a flat pack or an app image.

276
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,080
App image seems like it's pretty simple.

277
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,760
I haven't looked too much into, you know, here installing a runtime, etc.

278
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,320
But I'd be interested to see a comparison.

279
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,720
They have their own build kit and to it's not it's not bad at all.

280
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,760
And app image is really interesting, because when you first run it, you have to give you

281
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,560
have to manually give it permission to execute.

282
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,340
But once you launch it, it asks, do you want to put it in your your menus, right, like

283
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,340
automatically does that.

284
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,800
So that's pretty cool.

285
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,760
And maybe it's the excuse that or that the complaint that everyone goes against canonical

286
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,320
is like, not developed here.

287
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,440
Maybe gnome is doing the exact same thing.

288
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,280
And for some reason, people aren't mentioning that.

289
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,800
Yeah, and it's a shame we don't have something like the like what we're they're working on,

290
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,760
like on container standards, you know, some sort of here, we're gonna have static static

291
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,480
images keeping contained at all, actually, well, I will just in the same way of having

292
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,120
some sort of standard for if we're gonna do if we're gonna have less, you know, dynamic

293
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,280
linking, etc, in our in future ways that we're shipping software be cool, if we had some

294
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,040
sort of underlying target so that we could have, here's a snap, we can convert it to

295
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
a flight.

296
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
Right?

297
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,040
Yeah, for sure.

298
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Like, yeah, absolutely.

299
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,840
I think, I think it's two things.

300
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,600
I think it's two things to answer the core question, why not app image right now, I think

301
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,800
the first thing is, is that the gnome guys have been and gals have been working on this

302
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,320
for years, I if you if you recall back, I covered this story as gnome OS, and it's in

303
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,480
a sense, years ago, like they've been working on different iterations of this crazy idea

304
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,360
of applications that can move around.

305
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,840
And it's only really once they kind of let it die off.

306
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,760
And it was only really once since containers and sandboxing and all these kinds of different

307
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,040
things like Wayland and namespaces all started to become available options that we could

308
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,720
actually ship one day, they got serious about it again.

309
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,840
And a core component of it for them, this, I believe, is the second part is sandboxing.

310
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,600
They believe sandboxing fundamentally, and I've linked it in their wiki why they believe

311
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
this.

312
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,400
And they don't they don't want to use sandboxing for the reasons that like you traditionally

313
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,840
think of like, prevent you from getting access to things on your system, it is legitimately

314
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,680
to isolate the application to move it around and to protect the overall system.

315
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,920
And that's a core functionality for them.

316
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,040
And they see it not just core to security, but core to how these things are portable

317
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,680
to begin with.

318
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,280
And I think app image is a great solution.

319
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,320
I personally am I'm happy to download an app image thing.

320
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,760
I just really have it really hasn't been an issue for me.

321
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
Yeah, exactly.

322
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,320
App Images has actually been around for a while too, because they were originally the

323
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
portable apps.

324
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,320
Mm hmm.

325
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
That's true.

326
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,200
And it's really it's a really cool idea.

327
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,920
But as far as like, the containerization in the sandboxing, they don't really have any

328
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
of that.

329
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,240
So so I guess in a way, they're kind of improving the concept with the Flatpak, and also Flatpak

330
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,240
is a cooler name.

331
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
Yeah, way better.

332
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,920
Yeah, they're doing a better job with the branding.

333
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,760
So hopefully that will help, you know, people ship.

334
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,960
And I think the other thing that just maybe just to finish up the mindshare thing is I

335
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,440
think this is another example of mindshare, where mindshare makes a difference in app

336
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,440
image has gotten traction among some of us, but it just really hasn't gotten the mindshare.

337
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,560
And part of that is, and this is the part we just have a hard time connecting the dots

338
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,640
with is there are people from the known project that are going out to technology conferences

339
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,040
like Linux plumbers conference and, and, and then in the Gwadek and Fedora's and all the

340
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,400
different conferences, and they are they are promoting this idea, they're talking about

341
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,920
this idea, they're engaging with people about this idea in a way that is probably at a higher

342
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,240
intensity than the app image project.

343
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,780
Well, it kind of makes it feel like if you're targeting our platform, here's our solution

344
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,520
for this rather app image feels a little bit like you're an independent developer with

345
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,600
a one off app.

346
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Here you go.

347
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,080
You can package it up with totally, totally nailed that I think that and that's a big

348
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
way about me.

349
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,160
That's a big, you have to remember that's how the known project thing, right?

350
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,880
That's a and that's a big part of it.

351
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,260
Also, I would say last but not least, I think it just underscores how important the in person

352
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:00,840
application and meetings and discussions are to really move some of these important technologies

353
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,840
real.

354
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,640
Yeah, to move them through an open source community where everybody kind of has to sign

355
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,680
off and implement and all the different fiefdoms.

356
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,280
And the and that's something I think that the known projects just better at.

357
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:18,040
Speaking of that exact thing, system D, system D has a big update version two, three, oh,

358
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,760
when's the last time we even mentioned system D on this show.

359
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,800
And the reason why we're in a while, yeah, we're bringing it up because let's not kid

360
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,200
ourselves in terms of how long these things have been around, still kind of an early

361
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
project.

362
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
And this is a big update.

363
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,520
A lot of things are changing, right?

364
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,040
And it's one of those that they recommend themselves.

365
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,320
The project recommends that even the more aggressive distributions keep this one in

366
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,520
testing for extra longer.

367
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
Did you see that in there?

368
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
I did see that.

369
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
Yeah.

370
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,240
So there's a bunch of stuff like DNSSEC being turned on by default, etc, etc, etc.

371
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,400
But I wanted to jump right down to the one you're the most excited about.

372
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,560
This because it's, I get it on some level, but I think you have a bigger reason why you

373
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
like it.

374
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,760
And essentially what it is is the system D networking stuff will now allow a unique identifier

375
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,280
to be sent in a DHCP request.

376
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,120
And you can configure for each system in the.network file managed by system D networking

377
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:13,720
or network D. And they'll have different like DUIDs and DUID raw data and IAID options.

378
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,840
And I would guess this would be, well, I'm guessing so that when you're spinning up a

379
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,640
bunch of machines, you know what machine it is somehow.

380
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,400
I mean, why not just use MAC addresses, etc.

381
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,840
Well, it's mostly that.

382
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,280
So you do have control over the MAC address, but with IPv6, and like if you're using DHCPv6,

383
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,200
you can no longer for a lot of systems use a MAC address.

384
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,760
They use something, the DUID device unique identifier or something like that, which is

385
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,180
a longer string of hex characters in a similar fashion, like any kind of DUID.

386
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,520
But that is sent to identify a device.

387
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,080
So this adds support.

388
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,320
I've enjoyed system D network D. It's not going to do everything, but for servers or

389
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,120
especially containers where you probably already have system D, and you can make like a two

390
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,680
line file to enable DHCP on all your interfaces.

391
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,960
So when you're spinning up a new container, bam, you have addresses.

392
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,720
And then this just lets you add, which I've been looking forward to do for when I want

393
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,920
to, you know, I have some containers where I just like, they're going to be ephemeral.

394
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,780
I just want them to spin up, get an address, do something and disappear.

395
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,720
Some like I'm going to have more permanent and maybe they need static IP addresses or

396
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm going to have them in DNS or something like that.

397
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,040
So this will let you easily just add a line where you can change that identifier and you

398
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,920
can change like interspace specific or for the whole system and you can change the DHCP.

399
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,880
You can change it to have send a unique identifier instead of the MAC address.

400
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
So it'll just make it a lot easier.

401
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,920
And then your, you know, your DHCP server will just pick them right up, give them the

402
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,320
address that they want.

403
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,120
Also a bunch of stuff change your system D login D in this release too.

404
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,320
So that user, the user stuff is pretty big.

405
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
Yeah.

406
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,320
What is it?

407
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,320
And from my understanding...

408
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,120
So that's where when you, when your user session is over, now all of your programs will be

409
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
terminated.

410
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,120
Right.

411
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,440
If you have a team X running, it will be terminated.

412
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,140
So that's one of the big changes that they're stressing here that people will be looking

413
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,280
out for.

414
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,280
That was it.

415
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
Yeah.

416
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,280
And, yeah.

417
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,400
And I think in some regards it will, there'll be a point in time where we just think that's

418
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,360
obvious that it should be the default behavior, but it's a big transition.

419
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,560
It is a huge transition now.

420
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,960
And it, and it, you know, it just kind of makes sense.

421
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,440
It does fit if you, if you adopt what they suggest and you, you know, use it system D

422
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,400
run to run it in the right scope and is in the right user scope and everything, then,

423
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,800
then yeah, you can account for it well and you can control its resources, et cetera.

424
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,680
And probably you'll have, you know, there'll be a lot of stuff where you're going to set

425
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,640
up like a user level service for it anyway.

426
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,640
So it won't matter.

427
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,640
Yeah.

428
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,360
And that was, that is definitely the, that's going to just definitely make sure you do

429
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,920
set that up that way, which is just best practice anyways.

430
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,920
Right.

431
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,280
There are, I have seen way too many people where you're like, Oh, I'm just gonna, yeah,

432
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
it works.

433
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,280
I tested it out.

434
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
I run it into my session.

435
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
It works.

436
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,120
You don't have to really demonize it and you're like, yeah, yeah.

437
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,240
So watch out for that one.

438
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,040
And we have a link in the show notes with more info.

439
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Anything else to about at you?

440
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
Yeah.

441
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
I mean, there's a lot of, there's a lot of interesting stuff.

442
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,440
It depends on how you feel about system D, but they keep plugging along.

443
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Yeah, they do.

444
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,840
So the, the full release notes are in there.

445
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
All right.

446
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
Then watch yourself.

447
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,400
We got a little valve update kind of sort of not directly, not directly.

448
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,320
It's just a, let's see, where's my, here it is.

449
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
Oh yeah.

450
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
Oh, I got it right here.

451
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,200
My my steam controller, I bought the steam controller thinking this is going to become

452
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,600
the defacto Linux controller.

453
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
This is the one you're going to use.

454
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
You're going to try to erase the sun.

455
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
That's what you'll be using.

456
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,600
Yeah.

457
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
No more Xbox 360.

458
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
It's going to be this guy.

459
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
And I think.

460
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
No go?

461
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
No.

462
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,440
Well, um, the big problem was, is it's been so directly attached to steam.

463
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,440
Right.

464
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,160
That I just, the extra hassle of having to open up, even if I want to just play a game

465
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,440
I installed from a repo, having to open up steam and configure and all that kind of stuff.

466
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,140
It was a real bummer for me.

467
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,720
So I want to introduce you to SC controller.

468
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,440
Man, I love open source.

469
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,440
Look at this thing.

470
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
It's a GTK.

471
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
Well done.

472
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,000
Yeah, it's a GTK UI for configuring your steam controller, setting up all the buttons, what

473
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,760
they do, mapping all of the different stuff.

474
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,960
It allows you to configure it completely without ever launching steam profiles.

475
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,200
You can switch between games.

476
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,440
It's got stick pads and gyroscope input, haptic feedback support, macros, rapid fire mode

477
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
shift.

478
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,260
And you can also enable emulation for the Xbox 360 for a mouse pad and balls and keyboards

479
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,260
and all that.

480
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,260
Yeah.

481
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,480
So maybe some, maybe next week we'll have to give that a go.

482
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,480
Maybe, maybe.

483
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Yeah.

484
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,680
Cause it was just pretty, pretty, just a post over at gaming on linux.com and I'm really

485
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
impressed by this.

486
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,120
When was the last time you played with that bad boy?

487
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
Hmm.

488
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,880
Well at least two machines ago.

489
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
Right.

490
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
Yeah.

491
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
Cause I've had some machines in and out here.

492
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
Cause we've been moving hardware around.

493
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,880
Yeah.

494
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,880
So there you go.

495
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,880
I think that's really neat.

496
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
And it's posted up on GitHub.

497
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
We have a link in the show notes.

498
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
Yeah.

499
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
That's interesting.

500
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,780
That's a good, Liam says at the bottom of his post that a valve should really hire this

501
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,600
guy to speed up uncoupling the steam controller from big picture.

502
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
Yeah.

503
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
Yeah.

504
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
There you go.

505
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Yeah.

506
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
Have you tried it?

507
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Do you want to, have you, have you want to, you want to manhandle it there?

508
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
You want to?

509
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Ooh.

510
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Yeah.

511
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
That's nice, right?

512
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
It is smooth.

513
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
That's nice.

514
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
That's nice.

515
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Okay.

516
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
So just a super quick little heads up for you out there that are on Fedora and want

517
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
GUIs for all the things.

518
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,840
Yum extender is a GUI for managing, you guessed it, yum and DNF.

519
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
Really DNF.

520
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,080
Now it's a front end graphical interface for DNF.

521
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,080
You can check it out.

522
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,760
I think in the show notes called yum extender and yum extender powered by DNF.

523
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,720
Man, between that and that system D.

524
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
I know.

525
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
What can't you manage?

526
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
That's right.

527
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,720
That was the thing.

528
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,720
That system D manager works pretty well.

529
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
Looks pretty sweet.

530
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Yeah.

531
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,720
We talked about that in this week's Linux action show if you guys haven't seen that.

532
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
Okay.

533
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,720
So before we jump any further, we have a lot still to cover in the updates.

534
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,720
We probably need to pick up the pace.

535
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,140
We probably need to shake, shake it off like Mariah Carey.

536
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,960
So first let's talk about Ting because we got to get legit here for a second.

537
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
We got to get real.

538
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,200
We got to get real mobile that makes sense.

539
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,840
No more messing around with stupid guesses on how many minutes you might use or megabytes

540
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
or messages.

541
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,440
It's just pay for what you use over at Ting.

542
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,760
They got no contracts, no other termination fee, six dollar dollars.

543
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,760
That's it.

544
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,200
Six dollars is all you pay for the line.

545
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,080
Girl, are you hearing that?

546
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
Whoa.

547
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
Six dollars.

548
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,600
Plus you got the Uncle Sam taxes because Uncle Sam loves his cut.

549
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
Got to pay for that.

550
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,600
It's such a good deal he needs something.

551
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,300
Got to pay for all them important federal programs somehow.

552
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,880
So Ting's got to pay the pet taxes.

553
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,080
So all right, so it's six dollars taxes and then just what you use.

554
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,080
You on Wi-Fi?

555
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
You're not paying for nothing.

556
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,920
You want to get updates from your Android phone?

557
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
Ting don't care.

558
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,960
Ting is honey badger.

559
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
They don't care.

560
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
They don't care.

561
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
Why would they?

562
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
They don't care.

563
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
You can get updates.

564
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
Go to right now.

565
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
You ready?

566
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
Linux.ting.com.

567
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Linux.ting.com.

568
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,960
That's where you go.

569
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,840
You get yourself a little savings like 25 bones.

570
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,800
You support this show.

571
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,920
If you got a compatible device and you just might because they got CDMA and GSM, you get

572
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,960
credit on your account.

573
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,200
I'm not playing.

574
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
You get credit.

575
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,920
It's probably going to pay for more than your first month because that's how freaking inexpensive

576
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,920
Ting is.

577
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,560
All right, so you get the credit on the account.

578
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,040
Then you're so happy with it, you go do a little evangelizing.

579
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,720
Now I'm not telling you not to send people to linux.ting.com because that would seriously

580
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,120
help out our show if you spread that around.

581
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,080
But I'm just saying if you're a Ting customer, they got a referral program.

582
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,640
They got a referral program.

583
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,200
A referral program.

584
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
They got a referral program.

585
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,040
What kind of program is that?

586
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
It's a referral program.

587
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,040
And if you get people to switch over to Ting, you get a little something something.

588
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,760
And the reason why I don't want to say too much is because I think it's a better deal

589
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,760
than I can get you.

590
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,560
But just get started by going to linux.ting.com.

591
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
Just go right there.

592
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Check out your prices.

593
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
They got early termination relief programs.

594
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,600
If you got stuck on one of them duopoly contracts like a sucker.

595
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,600
Never again.

596
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
I was there.

597
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
I was there.

598
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
I feel you.

599
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
I was there.

600
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
I'm not there again.

601
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
No, no.

602
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,920
I don't go to Ting, Linux.ting.com.

603
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,100
It's different.

604
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,560
Ting keeps rates simple.

605
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,120
We don't make you pick a plan.

606
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,140
Instead, you just use your phone as you normally would.

607
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,140
How much you use determines how much you pay each month.

608
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,520
You can have as many devices as you want on one account.

609
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,800
That's good because when you use more, you pay less per minute, message or megabyte of

610
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,800
data.

611
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,760
Your usage plus $6 per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill.

612
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,760
Simple.

613
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,300
That's what we mean when we say...

614
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
Alright!

615
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,300
...mobile.

616
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,300
That makes sense.

617
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,300
I like this one too.

618
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:08,800
They got a good post up there by Luke about data caps, and about what an SOB they are

619
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
when you're trying to cut the cord.

620
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
They got a great blog too.

621
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
You can go read it.

622
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:17,840
Just start by going to linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com, and thanks for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

623
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,240
Alright, roll up your sleeves.

624
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
Whoa!

625
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,840
LibreOffice is getting to work in the Italian Army.

626
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,040
Following the announcement made last year, the Italian Army has moved forward with its

627
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,720
plans to replace Microsoft Office with LibreOffice.

628
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,000
So far, the Army has tested its plan across 5,000 workstations.

629
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Wow!

630
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
That's a pretty big roll up.

631
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Without any major problems too.

632
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yeah.

633
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Yeah.

634
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Now, they have those...

635
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,640
This is just the beginning, Wes, because once they get through this test program, this is

636
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
the part I really like.

637
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,880
I'm like, okay, yeah, that's great, you know, they're aiming to replace all MS Office by

638
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
the end of the year.

639
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,040
Okay, I've heard this story before.

640
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,360
This is the part I like.

641
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,960
The Department of Defense is also working on e-training materials to help new users

642
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,520
adapt to LibreOffice quickly, and once these materials are complete, the department aims

643
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,040
to release them under a copyleft license.

644
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,560
This will be a great contribution to LibreOffice project and will increase the adoption of the

645
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,520
Office suite across Italy.

646
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
Now that's a very good point.

647
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,520
Yeah.

648
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,240
I was just reading Visual Basic turned 25.

649
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,760
But VBA, right, the scripting language in so many of their Office projects, that still

650
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,000
exists, but it's not a major...

651
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,720
It's used all the time, but it's not being heavily developed.

652
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,920
There's so many things with open source here.

653
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,240
If the army has some sort of pain point or they need enhancement of a feature, they can

654
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,840
pay developers to do that, and everyone benefits.

655
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
That's true.

656
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
That's true.

657
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,600
And they don't have to wait for it to be in the interest of the parent company.

658
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Yeah.

659
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,600
And really, why not, if you're going to use the public's money to do something like this,

660
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
why not?

661
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Absolutely.

662
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
Yeah.

663
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
That's a nice thing too, you know?

664
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Okay.

665
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,440
So, Wes, you had a little bit of an arch story.

666
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,640
I secretly use Arch Linux.

667
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,000
And I thought this was kind of perfect, because it's about bringing PPAs to Arch, which, as

668
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,880
Popey is a recent Arch switcher, I'm sure this is going to be great for him.

669
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
This will kind of make it all...

670
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
Need something like this to, you know...

671
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,880
Yeah, make it familiar for him.

672
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
...facilitate his workflow.

673
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
Yeah.

674
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,680
So, this is a new tool that would allow you to create basically what they're calling PPAs

675
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
for Arch, which is kind of...

676
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,760
I don't know if I like the branding or the title, but the functionality does seem like

677
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,360
something maybe I could use.

678
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,360
Think of the Arch PPA like a do-it-yourself PPA personal package archive in the style

679
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,280
of PPAs.

680
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:31,320
Think popular Ubuntu's operating system PPAs, but hosted for you on your own terms, either

681
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,200
locally or on a server that you have access to, and they allow you to distribute packages

682
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,600
to hundreds of thousands of possible Arch users.

683
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,320
Arch-PPA developer Ryan McGuire says that he created this utility to help the Arch Linux

684
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:49,080
personal packaging ecosystem be more secure than it is right now, by making your own

685
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,520
private repo that doesn't get its audits contributed back upstream, and officially recognizing

686
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,520
software repositories where anyone with the proper skills can now upload, they can have

687
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,120
their own repo.

688
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,200
Wow!

689
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,900
This is where Arch-PPA comes in handy for AUR package maintainers who are looking for

690
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,760
an easy way to create a manual repository that they can maintain with the Arch Linux

691
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,320
packages they want to distribute in a secure, safe environment.

692
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,160
I love it for a LAN-like repository.

693
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,920
Yes, exactly, or on your VPN or whatever.

694
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,520
Nothing about that's like a PPA.

695
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,520
No.

696
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,800
It's more like an overlay.

697
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,640
I don't think people are going to suddenly add a bunch of these repositories when there's

698
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,560
already the AUR in place.

699
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:32,160
I like the Popeye and the Charms, just as we start moving PPAs to SNAPs.

700
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,440
But boy, I wish I had a comedy horn for that.

701
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
That's a good point.

702
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,440
That's it.

703
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,440
I will probably set this up and play with it.

704
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,440
Really?

705
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
Now, what's the use case?

706
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
Seriously.

707
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,800
Well, mostly things just like maybe like the ZFS module, you just build it once there

708
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,320
and then anyone else can jump right in.

709
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,680
I think it's because he hasn't refreshed his machine in a while, so he wants to trust more

710
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,680
weird stuff.

711
00:29:53,680 --> 00:30:00,160
Yeah, I was thinking, that's what I was thinking, ChilledPrimary, I guess, ChilledPrimary says

712
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,400
that it's great for the enterprises.

713
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Yeah, exactly.

714
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,200
You can kind of have, you can build your own, build your own use arch in the enterprise

715
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
though.

716
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,480
I mean, some must, I grant.

717
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
You are.

718
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
That's kind of crazy.

719
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
But you could now, I guess.

720
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,160
Well, it doesn't have to even be from the AUR, right?

721
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,120
It's just kind of a way to like, you can make your own package builds for whatever, your

722
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,060
own proprietary software, whatever, and then this will compile it and host a repo for you

723
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,360
so that any other arch machine can be configured.

724
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,840
Maybe you want your own custom kernel that you want to compile on your build host, host

725
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,840
it here.

726
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,240
You know, that seems fine.

727
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,100
What I was thinking is instead of getting it directly from the AUR, before you push

728
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,000
it to users, you check out the script, yeah, it's fine.

729
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Then I push it to users.

730
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,080
You know, you control the rates of how much comes from the AUR, how fast.

731
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,280
Or you then, and then you whack out your latest version of your package.

732
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,960
You run all your build tests, you run all the rest of your tests, and then you push

733
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,960
it to Brad.

734
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Yeah.

735
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,760
And if it does handle some of the dependency logic for you, that is, yeah, that is really

736
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
nice.

737
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
You're right.

738
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
Yeah.

739
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,760
Okay.

740
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,760
All right.

741
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,760
Now I'm starting to see it like for, for, I wish I had more droplets that still used

742
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
arch.

743
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,760
I only have one left that uses arch.

744
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,760
I was like, I just have it as a matter of principle now.

745
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,200
You know, I just keep it up because, well.

746
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200
You have to.

747
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,200
I can.

748
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,200
I can do it every day, brother.

749
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,640
This was a big story out of Google IO.

750
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,440
We really haven't covered Google IO in any of our shows much, except for Coder Radio.

751
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,200
But I thought maybe we could talk a little bit about this one, because I think you found

752
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,720
this link here, Wes.

753
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,480
It gives us a little insight about how they're going to be running Android apps securely

754
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:32,360
on Chrome OS, and you guessed it, containers.

755
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,980
They're going to be using containers on Chrome OS, yeah.

756
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:35,980
Not just containers, though.

757
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,980
I'll tell you about it.

758
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:40,800
So this is looking at a development preview, which is, you're going to have other versions

759
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,800
available in August.

760
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,800
You guys can get your hands on.

761
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,680
But apparently, Chrome OS has taken advantage of containers to get this Android app compatibility.

762
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,240
The full Android framework is implemented in a Linux container that isolates Android

763
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,280
from the rest of Chrome OS and puts its apps in a sandbox.

764
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,880
And here's a little bit of a diagram if you're watching the video version.

765
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,160
Yeah, that was a nice diagram.

766
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,880
A hardware abstraction layer has been built between Android and Chrome OS that runs native

767
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,400
ARM code on Chromebooks using processors with ARM instruction and emulates it on Chromebooks

768
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,240
using Intel processors.

769
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,640
With SE Linux, ah, yes, the secure version of Linux implemented in Android 4.3 back in

770
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:23,600
2003 on Android and in Chrome OS in 2012, the Android framework runs in a container

771
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,040
that isolates it from other containers and OS modules using Linux functionality called

772
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,680
namespaces.

773
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,840
Android is granted only specific privileges to view and interact with Chrome OS hardware

774
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,940
resources such as keyboards, cameras, communication stuff.

775
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,440
The isolation prevents potentially harmful code within the Android container from interacting

776
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,480
with code outside Android containers.

777
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,880
So containers in SE Linux is how they're going to get Android apps on Chrome OS.

778
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,160
Hopefully that does mean we'll be able to see it ported to other Linuxes at some point.

779
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,160
Yeah, but there's going to be a lot to set up.

780
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,160
Yep.

781
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:59,280
Yeah, every time this comes up, I think, would I actually use these apps on Linux?

782
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,320
It's also so strange to see, like, using, you know, kernel technology, but in such like

783
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:10,400
a far removed and heavily packaged and consumer focused, taking some hardcore like server

784
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,400
grade stuff.

785
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Very strange.

786
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,560
I mean, it's cool.

787
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
It's neat.

788
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,960
That's, but I guess I would check out the Photoshop app.

789
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:20,720
If I could try out the Photoshop app, I might try that.

790
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
And Evernote, maybe.

791
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,720
Mm hmm.

792
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,720
Yeah.

793
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Evernote, Photoshop.

794
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
I don't know.

795
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
I mean, there's a few things.

796
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,720
Bubble, UPMPs.

797
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,720
Sling TV.

798
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,720
I would like that too.

799
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,280
I would like that.

800
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
So I guess there's a few.

801
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
There's a.

802
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
Yeah.

803
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,280
OK.

804
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
All right.

805
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Maybe Google Play Music.

806
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
Maybe.

807
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
Oh, yeah, that's true.

808
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,280
Hmm.

809
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Hmm.

810
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,280
Yeah.

811
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,280
Look at that GitHub script there.

812
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,840
Muahaha in the chat room links the DigitalOcean Debian to ArchScript.

813
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,000
That is a thing.

814
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,080
That's also a great script.

815
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,600
If you want to learn a little bit how, like, init RAMFS and pivot root and that kind of

816
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,980
stuff works, I would definitely recommend checking those out because there's some clever

817
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,880
stuff you could do to convert a running system.

818
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,480
Yeah, you convert a running Debian box into an Arch box.

819
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,480
It's just awesome.

820
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,480
It helps now that there's a system involved.

821
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,480
Like, if you ever, like, in a conversation with someone, like, what can Linux do that

822
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,240
Windows can't do, really?

823
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,240
What can, what can?

824
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,160
Like, because I've got video games and I've got Exchange and Outlook.

825
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,160
What can Linux do?

826
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,080
And you're like, well, let me show you this.

827
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,080
Right.

828
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,080
Come here, son.

829
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,080
Sit down.

830
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,080
Let me show you something.

831
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,080
Yeah.

832
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,080
All right.

833
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,560
So anybody in the moment have thoughts about Android apps on Chrome OS?

834
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,920
I don't sense a lot of interest from you guys.

835
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,920
I'm already interested.

836
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,920
Okay.

837
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
It's cool.

838
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:34,800
It's something that I would like for people who already have a Chromebook, because I know

839
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,560
people who have them, even though I kind of didn't want them to get one, they get it anyway.

840
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,640
So it was kind of because they wouldn't, and immediately they started complaining about

841
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,920
not being able to install stuff and things like that.

842
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,120
So we kind of solved their problem.

843
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,480
But really, other than that, I don't care.

844
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,480
All right.

845
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,480
Who else?

846
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,880
I know a couple of people want to speak up.

847
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
Go ahead.

848
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:58,880
Yeah, and the Play Store has a wide variety of apps, which is-

849
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,880
And games.

850
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,880
With them.

851
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,880
Yes.

852
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,760
Which is far better than the Linux desktop that's available right now.

853
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,400
For example, Bacon Reader is the best Reddit client I've ever used, and nothing on Linux

854
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,520
can imagine.

855
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,520
So-

856
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,440
Those are fighting words right there.

857
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,560
But you can't have too many selection of apps.

858
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,160
So adding the Android ones is good.

859
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:29,720
I mean, they're not going to be- Theoretically, they could become Linux-based with the container

860
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
structure.

861
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,120
But right now, they're not even released yet, and it's going to be like a couple months

862
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,480
before it even becomes beta.

863
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,280
So the likelihood of it becoming Linux will be a very long time away.

864
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,280
I'm kind of curious to hear what Richard thinks, just from the perspective of OpenSUSE too.

865
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,320
I hear, well, Android Play Store has a lot of great apps that Linux desktop doesn't have,

866
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,760
and I guess maybe like this little primitive part in the back of my brain goes, uh-oh,

867
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
is that a threat?

868
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Is that a threat to Linux?

869
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,360
Is that a- Hold on, are we never going to get to the desktop now if something based

870
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,680
on Linux has these great proprietary Play Store applications?

871
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,680
What do you think, Richard?

872
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,480
Is that not really apples and oranges?

873
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,480
Is it a fair threat?

874
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,480
Your thoughts?

875
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,640
I've seen a few times now of trying to get mobile apps running on the desktop.

876
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,440
I mean, it's- I think I even had it running on one of my machines a while back, like way

877
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,120
in the early Android days when that kind of stuff wasn't too crazy.

878
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:34,440
It never really appeals because it isn't the right- the wrong form factor, the wrong screen.

879
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,520
It's like the same thing you already have with Android phone apps and Android tablet

880
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
apps.

881
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,480
Well, you're going to have, what, Android laptop apps?

882
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,880
Yeah, that is going to be funky, huh?

883
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Yeah.

884
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,880
Embedded West, your thoughts for people that might want this over, say, an iPad, like your

885
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,680
real basic user?

886
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:58,720
Yeah, I mean, I think it has a place for people like that who are just going to use it to

887
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,560
check mail or play games.

888
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,440
I think that it could be more beneficial than a tablet because it gives you a little bit

889
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,920
more flexibility.

890
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:12,880
I just don't think it could ever replace, at least for me, a true operating system where

891
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,080
I get file system access and stuff like that.

892
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:23,320
I mean, it is compelling to be able to buy a $300 or $200 or $180 laptop that has Chrome

893
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,640
and Android apps, but-

894
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,480
And I could see people who are already heavily invested, they've got the Pro apps for all

895
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,480
the different-

896
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
Yeah.

897
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
Oh, sure.

898
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
I've got my juice SSH Pro, whatever, all the things-

899
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,560
Or if games could actually work and there was a well-known game that comes out in the

900
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
Play Store.

901
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,560
That's true.

902
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,520
West, let me ask you this because this move and instant apps, which I'm sure you're familiar

903
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,120
with, you search for something in Google search and a link comes up and actually instead

904
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:49,560
of taking you to a website, it launches just the bare minimum app from the Play Store on

905
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,880
the fly.

906
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:57,400
Mind-blowing is this move, Android apps coming to Chrome OS, which Chrome OS, the web operating

907
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,520
system, the operating system for the web, the open web Google-

908
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,720
Yeah, I'm sent you.

909
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,520
Open web platform.

910
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:13,520
Is this and instant apps a massively anti-web, anti-open web ecosystem move?

911
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,280
Is this Google saying, you know what, you can't really have good app experiences in

912
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
the browser.

913
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,280
If you want good apps, you got to go native.

914
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,280
I mean a little bit.

915
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,040
I don't know if that's fully their intention but I can definitely see it as a potential

916
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,600
consequence of that.

917
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,360
I think they are still invested enough in the web that they don't – I don't think

918
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
that-

919
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,360
Sure.

920
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,600
All of them, especially as the giant organization they are, could be invested in that.

921
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:44,320
But you're right and it does build in that weird side premium extra layer that it just

922
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,520
doesn't – it's not really standard.

923
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:53,000
Well and as somebody – you got to wonder too like it really – I would rather just

924
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,160
– if I go to the web and I search for something in Google on the web, there's a very high

925
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,720
likelihood that I want a web result.

926
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Right.

927
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,720
You're already using it.

928
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,320
I don't want – if I want that app, I will go install that app.

929
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,320
I find the whole thing-

930
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,160
I have already been like frustrated by that.

931
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
Yeah.

932
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,320
So I guess it is – things are changing and Chrome OS is becoming a new beast that will

933
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,160
be entirely competitive on a different level and I think Richard absolutely is right.

934
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,680
If they don't nail the UI experience, which is going to be damn near impossible, I just

935
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,880
don't see how serious users will want to use it outside of note taking apps and things

936
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,520
like that.

937
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:38,960
I guess, JM, I will give you the last words on this because it does kind of feel like

938
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,440
a convergence of the two platforms in a sense using – because in a sense, if you look

939
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,920
at that diagram, just core fundamental Linux technologies to bring the two together.

940
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,920
Sure.

941
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,520
I mean this has been the long term strategy with Chrome OS and Android.

942
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,160
They've always planned to bring the two together eventually and they're going to

943
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:02,040
be the premium place where developers will go to publish their apps because it will be

944
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,040
Google first.

945
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
Forget Windows.

946
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
Forget Mac.

947
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,040
It will be on Google's platform.

948
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
Interesting.

949
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,680
I think you're probably right and nothing else we can do other than watch at this point.

950
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,680
So we move on.

951
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,680
And talk about it.

952
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
That's what we're here for.

953
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,680
Yeah.

954
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
And observe.

955
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,680
And then when it lands, we're like, told you.

956
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,200
You know what else they told you about is digital ocean.

957
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,440
This is really where you should go to spin up infrastructure on demand.

958
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:30,040
Now we know that the key decision you have to make is when you're using cloud computing,

959
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,280
it has to be done on a system that's actually good.

960
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,560
This is where digital ocean comes in.

961
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,280
They've got data centers all over the world, all over the world, using Linux as the base

962
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,200
operating system, KVM as the virtualizer, SSDs for all the disk IO, 40 gigabit e-connections

963
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,600
into the virtualizers, Class A data centers all over the world.

964
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,360
It is really, it's like nothing you could ever do without yourself.

965
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,000
That's a beautiful picture.

966
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,200
And then they come in there.

967
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,240
They come in there with that crazy VC funding, that Hoopspa and that great product and all

968
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,640
of a sudden they blow up.

969
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,920
And they're able to offer you real time, I mean, like, well, less than 55 seconds, spin

970
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,160
ups of virtual machines, starting at $5 a month for 512 megabytes of RAM, sorry, what?

971
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:19,020
A 20 gigabyte SSD, a blazing fast CPU, and a terabyte of transfer with a batacle, batacle

972
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,480
UI.

973
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,320
Nothing like this you've ever seen to manage your digital ocean droplet, shoot, son.

974
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,320
Girl please.

975
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,360
I wish I had an interface like this, but then to back that up.

976
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,360
The best API.

977
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Oh man.

978
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,360
The best API.

979
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,360
Woo!

980
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,360
You know.

981
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,360
First class.

982
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:42,840
If you're, if you're an API snob, you're hanging out in the bar, you're talking about

983
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:48,520
APIs with your API snobby friends, drinking your martinis.

984
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,520
Digital ocean's the top of the list.

985
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,440
Everybody talks about digital ocean.

986
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,440
It's that API.

987
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,440
It really is.

988
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,440
What's great about it is there's tons of open source applications already written that you

989
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,000
don't have to write yourself to take advantage of, so you can be super lazy.

990
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,600
But if you hate all of them, the API docs are great, so you just write your own.

991
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,160
And you know, back to that interface, back, back, back to that interface they got.

992
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,600
They got HTML5 console so you can manage your machine from boot all the way up to post.

993
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,680
One click application deployments.

994
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,160
One thing you got to do though.

995
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,160
One thing.

996
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,160
Hold on, West.

997
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,160
Let me make sure it's legit.

998
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,160
Let me see.

999
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
Double check.

1000
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
Double check.

1001
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,160
I'm checking here.

1002
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,160
Okay.

1003
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,160
Multiply that.

1004
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,160
Carry the two.

1005
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,160
Go this over here.

1006
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,160
Let's see.

1007
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,160
And I'll just run this crunch over here.

1008
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,160
Let's see here.

1009
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,160
Get it out of here.

1010
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,160
Oh yes.

1011
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,160
That's right.

1012
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,800
If you use the promo code DOUNPLUG, that's the thing they have to do.

1013
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,200
I thought it was just go there, create an amazing system, get your work done, experiment

1014
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,280
with something, put it into production, use whatever damn distro you think is best, and

1015
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,760
then enjoy their incredible documentation.

1016
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,680
I thought that's all I had to say.

1017
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,200
But then I remembered.

1018
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,940
We would like to do episode 147.

1019
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,940
We really would.

1020
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,000
So you got to use that promo code DOUNPLUG.

1021
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
That's the thing.

1022
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Keep us here.

1023
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
You got to do that.

1024
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
You get a $10 credit.

1025
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,600
You try out their $5 rig, two months for free.

1026
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,880
Keep us going.

1027
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,680
Use that promo code DOUNPLUG and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplug

1028
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,600
program.

1029
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,800
Now Wes, there's this crazy upstart out there.

1030
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,360
I don't think Ryan's not in the Mamba Room, is he?

1031
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,360
He's not in there?

1032
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,500
No, I don't see him.

1033
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:25,340
There's this crazy project out there that's working on this thing to compete with Google

1034
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,680
Home or whatever they're calling it, the Amazon Echo.

1035
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,680
And we've talked about it before.

1036
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,840
It's called Mycroft.

1037
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:35,480
And recently, the Mycroft project released Mycroft Core 0.6 Alpha.

1038
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,480
Shipping.

1039
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,080
Shipping some code.

1040
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,520
And they put it up on GitHub.

1041
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,680
You can download it and get it running on Ubuntu.

1042
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
Whoa.

1043
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,680
What was that?

1044
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,200
What was that?

1045
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,560
I think that was a space-time distortion.

1046
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,560
I think so, yep.

1047
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,560
Yeah, we hit a micro fragment.

1048
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,880
That was the Mycroft AI in the future reaching back.

1049
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,880
That's exactly what I was thinking.

1050
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,880
Tell us to keep going.

1051
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,040
Because I was about to show you the Mycroft with his pants off.

1052
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,040
Look at this.

1053
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,680
Isn't it just so cute?

1054
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:00,300
This is the dev unit here.

1055
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,000
And if you're watching the video version, we have this linked, the video in the show

1056
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
notes.

1057
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,560
The Mycroft with his pants off, so you can see all the guts here.

1058
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,600
And this thing is looking really good.

1059
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,560
This is just a prototype, right?

1060
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,560
I'm impressed.

1061
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,640
But what's so great about Mycroft in this Amazon Echo era now is...

1062
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,640
You mean besides their name?

1063
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,640
Yeah.

1064
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,640
Yeah, that is a great name.

1065
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,640
You're right.

1066
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,640
That is really brilliant.

1067
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,440
What's so great though, and it's not...what also is great is they're open sourcing tons

1068
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,820
of different code, but the thing that I really love about Mycroft, the thing that really

1069
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:34,000
gets me excited about Mycroft is you can just get Mycroft Core and install it on any damn

1070
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,360
thing you want.

1071
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:41,460
And that means I could truly, eventually, if I had the chutzpah and initiative, I could

1072
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,640
deploy Mycroft ubiquitously in my life.

1073
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,080
I could have it on my Kodi box.

1074
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,080
I could have it on my server.

1075
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,080
I could have it on my desktop.

1076
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,080
Mycroft.

1077
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,080
Start the show.

1078
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:55,960
I mean, it truly...because I'm not going to buy 50 Google Homes or 50 Amazon Echoes or

1079
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,960
whatever.

1080
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,360
But if I could get a couple of Mycroft devices where I don't want an easy button, and then

1081
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,520
I can install the software in all the other places, like my phone, like my desktop, like

1082
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,520
my laptop, like my server.

1083
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,520
Computers, whatever.

1084
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,520
Yeah.

1085
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,480
So, I know you've been playing around with it.

1086
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,960
I think Ham's been playing around with it.

1087
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,960
I don't know.

1088
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,960
Have you actually gotten started yet?

1089
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,200
Because it's pretty early days still.

1090
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,400
I haven't quite, but I haven't had time to look into too much of the configuration.

1091
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,400
What's the process like?

1092
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:24,120
Well, it's a Python app, and they have some nice scripts that'll install all the app dependencies

1093
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,680
for you and set up in a virtual environment.

1094
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,640
I haven't gotten the sound...I haven't gotten it working quite yet, but I'm sure if I play

1095
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,960
with it for a little bit longer, I'm excited to get it to work.

1096
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,600
Now, Ham, you were saying in chat earlier today that you've been playing with it too,

1097
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,600
yeah?

1098
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,600
Yeah, I actually got it working.

1099
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:45,460
I cloned the Git repo, and I read the README file.

1100
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:46,460
Super easy.

1101
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:52,360
It was 0.6.0, I couldn't get it to build, but they released a new version just a day

1102
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:57,640
or two later, 6.1, and that one built for me super easy.

1103
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:04,120
I rebooted the computer, like they said, opened the terminal, three terminal instances, and

1104
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,120
ran the commands they said, and I got Mycroft running.

1105
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:14,560
I said, hey, Mycroft, open up CNN.com, and it opened up CNN.com, opened up Thunderbird

1106
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,640
just fine, a few problems here and there, but it's pretty cool.

1107
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,640
That's great.

1108
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:24,120
Now, did you also have to create an account with the intent parsing service or something

1109
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,520
like that, which I guess is going to be...they're going to be moving to an open source solution,

1110
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,040
but right now, you have to go create an account somewhere, right?

1111
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:37,400
Oh, that is correct, sybaris.mycroft.ai, I think it is, yes, I did have to create an

1112
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,400
account there.

1113
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,220
But that's just pretty quick and simple, and that's just used to do some of the speech

1114
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,720
recognition, I guess?

1115
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:49,640
Oh, yeah, I signed in using my Google account, and so it took like two seconds to sign in,

1116
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:56,640
and I just said, Mycroft, pair up my device, and Mycroft gives me a little code.

1117
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:00,360
I put it in there, and I was paired within literally two minutes, is that...

1118
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,980
Can you try other things, like can you ask it for weather?

1119
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:08,480
Is there any additional things you can ask, or is it pretty basic right now?

1120
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:13,720
I asked, what's the weather, and it gave me the weather for some place in Kentucky or

1121
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:24,160
something, and I'm like, hey, Mycroft, change my location to Lewiston, Idaho, and it totally

1122
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,560
didn't get it at all.

1123
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,480
So does it feel sort of like a verbal command line right now, or does it feel like you're

1124
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,880
having a conversation?

1125
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,080
Like a verbal command line, it is not a conversation.

1126
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,280
I mean, when I asked, what's the weather, and it said, it's sunny out here, you better

1127
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,280
get your...

1128
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,040
It said, you better get your sunglasses.

1129
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,040
That's kind of fun.

1130
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,040
Yeah, that's kind of fun.

1131
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,040
Yeah.

1132
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,920
Yeah, I think there's two different types of assistance right now.

1133
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:57,040
I feel like Siri and Google Now and Amazon Echo really are very much...

1134
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,320
They're command lines, and if you learn to say things in this precise order, like, hey,

1135
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,160
they're googs, set a reminder for 5.30 PM.

1136
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,160
It works pretty well.

1137
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,240
And then they'll say, what would you like a reminder for?

1138
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,840
Remind me to tell Wes that he's awesome, and then it sets a reminder, right?

1139
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,720
And you have to very much walk through a sequence like that.

1140
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:21,720
And what the next generation of artificial intelligence is doing is more conversational.

1141
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:26,200
And you see, we're kind of there now, but they're not necessarily as reliable, because

1142
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:32,160
they depend on being able to suss out your intent and your context, whereas the command

1143
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:38,360
line is a little more intentional, a little more exact, and it can also be replicated

1144
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,360
on text.

1145
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,920
And that's where I really think...

1146
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,600
I was joking earlier, but I would love to see...

1147
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:49,080
So Mycroft has this intent engine, and I would love to see if this thing could be integrated

1148
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,080
at all different aspects.

1149
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,840
If it truly is, it's all open, and my desktop is open, could Mycroft intent be integrated

1150
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,100
into the app launcher to learn what apps I most frequently launch?

1151
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:04,260
Could Mycroft intent be integrated into my contacts application?

1152
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:11,760
Could this be a pervasive artificial intelligence system for the Linux desktop?

1153
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:18,520
Something that is not driven by necessarily a strategy tax by a larger parent company

1154
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,520
or something like that.

1155
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,520
I just find the possibilities to be really compelling, because it's not just a hardware

1156
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,520
box, right?

1157
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,520
Because it's software.

1158
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,200
If you really haven't got it working yet, and it's kind of hit and miss, it is possible.

1159
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,760
Ham's got the beginning version of it.

1160
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,160
And this is 0.6 alpha.

1161
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,160
That's really cool.

1162
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,800
Anybody else in the Mumble Room have any thoughts on the topic?

1163
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,800
Yeah.

1164
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:44,160
Oh, go ahead, Poppy, and then North.

1165
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:50,960
So I was at OSCON last week, and I met Ryan Sipes, the CTO of Mycroft AI, and I held one

1166
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,320
of the Mycrofts in my hand for the first time.

1167
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,320
I saw your tweet.

1168
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,320
That was great.

1169
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,320
Wow.

1170
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,320
Yeah.

1171
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:05,160
And he said to me that I asked about the voice stuff and whether the new voice was ready.

1172
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,320
And he said they've got a new version.

1173
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:12,080
They've been regenerating all the sounds.

1174
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:16,080
And he said there was a problem with one of the early ones that the voice sounded a little

1175
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,660
bit like Max Headroom.

1176
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:20,880
So we go, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1177
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,200
He really wanted to keep that in, but they decided, no, it would be unprofessional to

1178
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,200
do that.

1179
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,600
So we got rid of that, unfortunately.

1180
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,600
I really want that.

1181
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,360
Yeah, that would be maybe later.

1182
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,360
Maybe later.

1183
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:31,360
That would be good.

1184
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:32,920
So, Poppy, did you get it?

1185
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,240
Was the noise environment suitable to trying it at all?

1186
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,240
How was that like?

1187
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:41,160
Not really, because the conference center was just so noisy.

1188
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,320
Every so often you could, like randomly, it would start talking, and you'd see the little

1189
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:50,200
lips, the light lips moving on the front, and it was very cute when it's talking.

1190
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,160
But it was just way too noisy in there for us to get a good demo.

1191
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:59,440
So your thoughts just overall on integrating Mycroft at more than just, to me, and I wonder

1192
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,400
for you too, it seems to be more compelling than just a little hardware device.

1193
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,120
I would like to see that just be one representation of how I interact with Mycroft.

1194
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:11,080
Do you see it being much bigger than just a hardware device?

1195
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:16,880
So you were talking there about having access to your most recent apps and stuff, like most

1196
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,600
modern desktops have that kind of surfacing, that kind of data, or using stuff like Zeitgeist,

1197
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,240
which would keep track of which documents you've opened.

1198
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:30,520
If you could say to Mycroft, open the document I had open last Tuesday when I was listening

1199
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,360
to ABBA or something, because you remembered the document and what you were listening to

1200
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,360
at the time.

1201
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:40,600
That is kind of the purpose of Zeitgeist, that it records what you're doing all the

1202
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,640
time.

1203
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:48,320
So there's a data source there that could certainly be mined by Mycroft, and I think

1204
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,740
that would be awesome if it was all integrated together.

1205
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:57,240
The Mycroft project is an interesting one to watch because, boy, the timing is perfect.

1206
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,240
It really is.

1207
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,040
It was just – I'm so thrilled that we're not really behind the curve on this.

1208
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,880
It really felt like we were going to be missing out before Mycroft started getting all the

1209
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,120
momentum they have now.

1210
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:11,080
But since Ryan Sipes, who I think is just great.

1211
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:19,360
I think Ryan – he's a great – not only is Ryan very well spoken and he articulates

1212
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,360
the project's vision.

1213
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,880
He's a wonderful advocate.

1214
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,880
But he's also just a super nice guy to hang out with and chat with.

1215
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,300
He was going to join us today, but I'm assuming he's just super busy, because he had emailed

1216
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,180
me earlier today saying, hey, can I make it, and I said, yeah, absolutely.

1217
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,440
So that's totally understandable.

1218
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:37,440
I wonder –

1219
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,440
Come back any time.

1220
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,760
If he was here, what I would like to ask him – probably the hardest question I would

1221
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,280
have had for him is, is it getting too much?

1222
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,440
Is it growing too fast?

1223
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:57,200
Is this weird thing that – I don't know how to explain it, but I could tell that our

1224
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:03,960
audience was not super impressed by this update and was having a hard time parsing it.

1225
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,960
And so –

1226
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,960
It's pretty long and –

1227
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:12,200
It's long, dense, and it's not traditionally as well done as communication from the Mycroft

1228
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,360
project.

1229
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:18,720
And so I think it kind of fell a little flatter than maybe they were expecting, or at least

1230
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,360
I was expecting, because I think this is a bigger deal than people are realizing.

1231
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:28,760
And I don't know if every single stupid thing – well, it's not stupid, but if every single

1232
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:33,080
little thing needs a video with some hipster music and a tweet or what –

1233
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,080
Chris, you know that it does.

1234
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,080
Well, okay.

1235
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,080
That's probably true.

1236
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,080
Yeah.

1237
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,640
And a scrolly website.

1238
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:45,200
So maybe I just would like to ask him – and what I'm worried about is, does something

1239
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,560
like this that has not just their ideas of what would be great, but then once you start

1240
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:54,660
talking to other people and you start working with other groups, a lot of other ideas start

1241
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,320
getting brought into the mix.

1242
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,320
People start telling you, you should do this.

1243
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,320
You also got to do this.

1244
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,320
Get involved with this.

1245
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,320
Go to this event.

1246
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,320
Make sure you talk to these people.

1247
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:07,920
Make sure you talk – and I wonder if scope creep is becoming an issue at all.

1248
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,240
So maybe Ryan will join us soon and we can talk about that, because even from the perspective

1249
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:21,940
of managing an open source project that is fairly well watched, what's that like?

1250
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:24,920
What does that feel like?

1251
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:30,400
What happens if you decide you're going to hit your – like really Wimpy to some degree

1252
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,960
has this too with Ubuntu Mate.

1253
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:32,960
Absolutely.

1254
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,540
And of course, Richard has this with OpenSUSE.

1255
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:43,640
What is it like when all of a sudden you're dealing with something that is very, very

1256
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:44,640
heavily watched?

1257
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,800
Richard, do you have any thoughts just off the top of your head as I just sort of sprung

1258
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:48,800
this on you?

1259
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,800
Well, yeah.

1260
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,000
I mean, I guess I've kind of got an example today.

1261
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,280
I mean, we've just released 42.2 Alpha 1.

1262
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,780
Like we thought we knew the scope.

1263
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,780
We knew everything.

1264
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:02,240
And like the first bunch of feedback is, oh, we want this extra thing and this extra thing

1265
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,240
and this extra thing.

1266
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:12,080
But on one hand, you want to say yes to everything because it's – part of that's where the

1267
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,100
enthusiasm comes from.

1268
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:17,600
On the other hand, you can see if you say yes to everything, you're going to end up

1269
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,600
with an ungodly mess.

1270
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,600
Yeah.

1271
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,600
Absolutely.

1272
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,600
Like you get monster scope creep.

1273
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:22,600
NorthRanger, you had a positive spin.

1274
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,600
I'd love to hear that.

1275
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,600
Yeah.

1276
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,320
So you talk about what they've been out in the community talking about.

1277
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,600
You worry about the scope creep.

1278
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,660
I think you're totally right on the timing of this that I think their timing actually

1279
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:40,400
is good because people's awareness of these types of devices and these types of services

1280
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:46,760
is constantly increasing with Amazon Echo and Google Now and Siri.

1281
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:54,640
But all of those existing solutions are very much focused on Amazon wants to sell you stuff.

1282
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:03,720
Google wants to mine all your S. Whereas Mycroft, if you set aside what they're talking about

1283
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:09,960
and focus on what they've actually done, they're showing real hardware and they're releasing

1284
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:16,160
the core, the things that you have to get right, the speech recognition, the ability

1285
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,000
to create intents and create actions.

1286
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,160
And that's where I think the open source community can take in and run with it.

1287
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:26,160
Yeah.

1288
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,160
That's well said.

1289
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:32,200
And also just as a tip of the hat to the Mycroft project, when you go to sign up for that account

1290
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,320
where Ham said he just uses Google and you can just super quick get in there and get

1291
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:39,680
the speech recognition, they literally say, like, hey, if you want to help out and give

1292
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,240
us a little financial contribution, we're going to be able to replace this whole proprietary

1293
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:47,700
have to log in thing way faster and we'll have the open source solution ready to go.

1294
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:48,700
That's our direction we're going.

1295
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,320
We're going to get there one way or another.

1296
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,800
Here's a couple of ways you can help us get there faster.

1297
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,800
And you look at Mycroft as a project that was funded initially by the community and

1298
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,200
they're not done yet.

1299
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:04,240
And that, I thought, I thought what that represented was a super clever way to continue additional

1300
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,480
bits of funding because you know, you know that they can't just go raise, even if they

1301
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,840
raised five hundred thousand dollars, that money is going to run out when you start hiring

1302
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,200
people and you start having expenses and you start having to go to events and they're just

1303
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:20,000
like world class work here, you know, like these are the things that like, yeah, of course,

1304
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,500
they're having to like this is like, you have to outsource some of this stuff because right

1305
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,520
now all the solutions that anyone uses are proprietary.

1306
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:30,000
So they're like exploring new ground and doing work that a lot of them could be paid good

1307
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
money to do.

1308
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Yeah.

1309
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,360
So I think it's I really hope they come up with a solid revenue stream that doesn't necessarily

1310
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:39,260
involve data analytics of their customers.

1311
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:42,440
But it comes, you know, a great way to raise money that contributes back to the project

1312
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,040
because you want to see something like this continue.

1313
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,760
And it's really cool it's gotten this far because of community funding so far.

1314
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,320
And then, of course, open source development.

1315
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,320
All right.

1316
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,320
Let's take a moment.

1317
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:56,680
Speaking of community funding, it's time to talk about the Libram 11.

1318
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:03,000
It's called and dubbed the surface book for those of you who care about your privacy and

1319
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
your freedom.

1320
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
What?

1321
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Okay.

1322
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,320
I have a few thoughts on this as somebody who funded their first attempt at crowdfunding

1323
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,920
hardware, the Libram 15.

1324
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,840
So come over here into the hallway with me for just a moment, Wes, and let's talk about

1325
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,200
Linux Academy.

1326
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,200
Linux Academy.

1327
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,200
Dot com.

1328
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,200
Go there now.

1329
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,200
Slash Unplugged.

1330
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,200
Slash Unplugged.

1331
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,200
You got to go there to get the discount.

1332
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,200
Go there now.

1333
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:28,200
And support the show.

1334
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,200
So, Wes, let's get real while we're out here in the hallway.

1335
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,720
If you don't know this, we're out in the hallway right now.

1336
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,720
We stepped out of the studio.

1337
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,020
The hallway always sounds like this.

1338
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,880
This is how it sounds at Jupiter Broadcasting Studios.

1339
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,880
Of course.

1340
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,880
We've got all these computers here.

1341
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,880
This is why it sounds like this.

1342
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:45,760
If you want to chill in the hallway, Wes, if you want to get your employer's attention,

1343
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,720
if you want to maybe do a little better on the next review or get a raise, you know one

1344
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,640
of the ways to do that is to continue your education and show them you're expanding your

1345
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,000
knowledge set.

1346
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,140
It's legitimately one of the best ways to get your employer's attention.

1347
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:03,680
It's one of the best ways to make you more employable and it's also a great way to challenge

1348
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,680
yourself.

1349
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,680
Linux Academy.

1350
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,680
Dot com slash unplugged.

1351
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,680
Come on.

1352
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,360
Step out here into the hallway with us and think about it just for a little bit.

1353
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,360
Go there and try them out.

1354
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,360
Linux Academy.

1355
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,360
Dot com slash unplugged.

1356
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,360
You get a discount.

1357
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:19,680
They have self-paced courses with two thousand four hundred and four to seven videos, scenario

1358
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:26,000
based labs that put you in the middle of everyday common tasks, instructor mentoring.

1359
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Could you imagine?

1360
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
You're standing out here in the hallway.

1361
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Let Linux Academy tell you what to do.

1362
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
You're out here on the hallway.

1363
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,760
You're looking at your smartphone and you're thinking, you know what, I need help.

1364
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,200
They got it.

1365
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,200
Instructor mentoring.

1366
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,200
Because you're in the hallway right now.

1367
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,200
Right there.

1368
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,200
Linux Academy.

1369
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,200
Linux Academy.

1370
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,200
They got graded server exercises.

1371
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,200
Sign up.

1372
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,200
Right now.

1373
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,040
Because this is not neural programming.

1374
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,040
This is the hallway.

1375
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,040
OK?

1376
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,040
This is the hallway.

1377
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,040
This is not neural programming.

1378
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,040
Linux Academy.

1379
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,040
Dot com slash unplugged.

1380
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,040
You go there.

1381
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,040
You learn more.

1382
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,040
You got graded server exercises.

1383
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,680
So that way, if you're like me and you s' your pants when you gotta take a test.

1384
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,640
You know what I don't like is scenarios where there's no option other than win lose.

1385
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,000
I like a couple of options.

1386
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,680
I want a plan B. I want a plan B. Here, now come over here.

1387
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,880
Now let's step into the computer room.

1388
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,160
Yeah, OK.

1389
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,640
So here we are in the computer room now, Wes.

1390
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,360
Right next to the studio.

1391
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,880
We got data to crunch here, folks.

1392
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:16,880
Yeah.

1393
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,920
And the way we learned how to do that is Linux Academy.

1394
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,920
Linux Academy.

1395
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,920
Dot com slash unplugged.

1396
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,920
They got the best courseware.

1397
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,920
I'm going to say it right now.

1398
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:23,920
The best courseware on the Red Hat stuff.

1399
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,080
Oh, you got stuck in the dev ops position all of a sudden.

1400
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,080
Oh, I shouldn't say stuck.

1401
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,080
I shouldn't.

1402
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,640
One, they'll tell you what that term means.

1403
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,160
Two, they'll tell you how to effectively use those tool sets.

1404
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,560
They've also got great, great courseware on Amazon Web Services, Android Development,

1405
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:43,360
Ruby, OPHP, and their courseware comes with their servers.

1406
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,360
What?

1407
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:48,400
Had we not mentioned that?

1408
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,160
I got to say, I should have mentioned at the top.

1409
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,360
See, I'm a rookie here.

1410
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,680
I should have mentioned at the top.

1411
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,440
You get to choose from seven plus distributions.

1412
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,960
No, this is not neural programming.

1413
01:00:58,960 --> 01:00:59,960
I'm just letting you know.

1414
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:00,960
OK.

1415
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:01,960
Seven.

1416
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:07,640
Seven plus distributions, and then they automatically adjust the courseware.

1417
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,640
Virtual machines.

1418
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,640
Crazy.

1419
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,640
They spin that up on demand.

1420
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,760
They spin up that, and it matches the courseware.

1421
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,040
Now think about that.

1422
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:17,960
That's how you know that they actually know how to use this stuff.

1423
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,040
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1424
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,040
Go check them out.

1425
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,040
They've got great instructor mentoring.

1426
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,760
They have a community stacked full of Jupiter Broadcasting members, and I think the other

1427
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:30,080
thing that really speaks for them is they legitimately have constant results.

1428
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,080
It's really neat.

1429
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,440
And actually, I like it when you tweet me and you tell me about it, too.

1430
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,440
So thanks, you guys.

1431
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,440
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1432
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,280
All right.

1433
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,560
So we've stepped back into the studio.

1434
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:43,840
We're no longer in the hallway or the computer lab or whatever that last room was.

1435
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:48,960
I want to talk about the Liebroom 10, a 10.1 inch two-in-one detachable laptop tablet designed

1436
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,600
to protect your digital life.

1437
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:56,360
From the Purism folks, they say it's beautiful freedom, and they believe in users' rights.

1438
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,760
It's a tablet and a laptop.

1439
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,840
They say a ton of work to make the Gnome Shell ready for this.

1440
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,840
It ships up.

1441
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,280
Yeah, and it ships Pure OS, and they got a video.

1442
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,680
It doesn't really say much, but I guess I could read you the highlights because I don't

1443
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,000
think there's actually any voiceover here.

1444
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,880
So they say, what's on your tablet?

1445
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,620
Privacy isn't about what you want to hide.

1446
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:27,380
It's about what you need to protect.

1447
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:33,960
If you could design the ultimate tablet, what would it be?

1448
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,160
You are helping design your next computer.

1449
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,160
We are listening.

1450
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,240
Hey, it's Todd.

1451
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:44,440
Your current computer and service providers know more about you than anybody else.

1452
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:51,160
Apple, Google, or Microsoft hold the master key to your digital life.

1453
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:57,120
You want a computer designed to protect you rather than monitor you.

1454
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:03,040
Introducing the Liebroom 11, the latest computer from Purism designed by you to protect your

1455
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,080
digital life.

1456
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:10,840
An 11-inch, two-in-one detachable privacy, security, and freedom-focused computer running

1457
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:16,520
Pure OS 3.0 where you hold the master key to your entire digital life.

1458
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,520
All right.

1459
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:26,320
We've been to the Chris Last school of music overlays here.

1460
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:31,920
The Liebroom 11 turns off remote spying with hardware kill switches.

1461
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,320
It does not track you at all.

1462
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,000
Nor does it phone home to the parent company.

1463
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,080
The Liebroom 11 runs free software with the source code available to verify that it protects

1464
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,120
your digital rights.

1465
01:03:44,120 --> 01:04:00,000
And above all else, makes protecting yourself as easy as turning it on.

1466
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:06,800
At Purism, we believe protecting your digital rights should be easier than giving them up.

1467
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:13,140
We make hardware and software that is designed to protect your digital life.

1468
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:18,080
In order to achieve this goal, Purism has amassed an amazing team of the best freedom

1469
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:30,560
operators from all over the world.

1470
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,760
With your help, Purism will continue leading the way in protecting everybody's digital

1471
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,760
life.

1472
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:35,760
Thank you.

1473
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,760
Man.

1474
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:40,880
I'll tell you what, I'm pretty stoked about that hammock in the back of Todd's yard there.

1475
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:41,880
That's nice.

1476
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,920
That shows he's got good taste.

1477
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,920
That looks comfy.

1478
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,200
I'm more confident now.

1479
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:49,880
So the Liebroom 11, a two-in-one tablet that protects your privacy.

1480
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:53,040
They want to raise $150,000.

1481
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,160
They have two months left, so it's a real long one over on IndieGoGo.

1482
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,060
Real nice and long one.

1483
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:08,080
And they've so far raised $12,455 with only 11 backers.

1484
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:09,480
Eleven backers.

1485
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,480
Starting at $999.

1486
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:16,160
You can get a $599 if you want a less capable one.

1487
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:22,640
So, I got a lot of thoughts on this, but I guess I wanted to open it up to you first,

1488
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,120
Wes, and then I'll toss it over to the Mumba Room after that.

1489
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,120
What do you think?

1490
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:30,440
Do you, at this point, what is just your initial thoughts?

1491
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,640
I mean, people might not be fully familiar with my history with the company, so that

1492
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:37,200
aside, what is just your initial thoughts on something like this?

1493
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,440
There are some good things and some bad things.

1494
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:42,680
They're very zoomed in on this core M processor here on the page, which has me a little off

1495
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:43,680
but already.

1496
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:45,480
But I think the video was good.

1497
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:50,200
I think there are some people with very good intentions behind this.

1498
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,120
Bringing in your history there, I do have some questions about if they'll be able to

1499
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:58,480
ship it, what it really will look like, and I also don't know how much I'm that interested

1500
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:03,440
in the tablet two-in-one workflow anyway.

1501
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,120
Here's my question.

1502
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:11,720
I don't know how to state this in a way that doesn't – that maybe if you're not already

1503
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:20,160
there with me, you might not understand, but inherently, would you agree or disagree that

1504
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:24,760
one of the features of a tablet is build quality?

1505
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,760
Yeah, I agree.

1506
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,760
I mean –

1507
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,880
And would you agree or disagree that one of the features of a tablet is content consumption

1508
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,000
and therefore its ecosystem?

1509
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,280
Yep.

1510
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:39,120
And would you agree that one of the things of a tablet that makes it compelling to a

1511
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:45,640
large market is a healthy accessory ecosystem, maybe like cases for kids, charging stations

1512
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:50,120
for people that want to have multiple charging options, Bluetooth speakers that have holders

1513
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:54,200
that are – you know, like connector speakers and chargers that hold alarm clocks and things

1514
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,200
like that.

1515
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:58,680
It's an ecosystem that I would say you could say makes a tablet viable.

1516
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,320
Would you agree with that to some degree or not?

1517
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:02,320
No.

1518
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:07,120
I mean I think I see what you're saying and that – I mean right there, that limits

1519
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:12,040
the scope of who could be interested in this.

1520
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:15,320
I mean if – I'm really curious to see what they – you said they've done a lot

1521
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:16,800
to the Nome Shell.

1522
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,560
It would be really interesting to see this succeed.

1523
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:21,920
I don't – you know, I don't want to preclude this being an awesome product.

1524
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:27,040
Well, I mean for a tablet, so it's going to have Linux, 16 gigabytes of RAM, user-upgradable

1525
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:31,400
easily removable screws, six to eight battery lives, hardware kill switches for wireless

1526
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:35,400
Bluetooth camera, microphone, GPS, and the cellular data if you get it.

1527
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,400
Oh, wow.

1528
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,400
Cellular data.

1529
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,400
Yeah.

1530
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:45,800
So I think it ties back with the laptop, you know, with the – there's a lot of things

1531
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,320
here that I could really like and I'd love to see it succeed.

1532
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:53,060
I don't know that it will and I don't know that what percentage of success that

1533
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:55,320
they do achieve will be enough to make it worthwhile.

1534
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,320
Hmm.

1535
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:02,720
Anyone in the room have any thoughts about – I mean is this a good pivot?

1536
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:07,060
Is this maybe a pivot from building – trying to compete in the traditional laptop space

1537
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:11,200
and saying we're going to go after this sort of niche here, this surface niche?

1538
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:19,480
Yeah, because what the year they were competing in before, there were a lot of providers like

1539
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:24,400
– in Europe there's Antroer and Schenker and PC Specialists.

1540
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:28,240
There were a lot of boutique companies that just repackaged clearful products.

1541
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:34,880
But there doesn't seem – from these companies, there doesn't seem any proper surface competitors.

1542
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:40,260
So I think it's a nice niche to go into and from my experiences with my brother Surface

1543
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:45,200
Pro and with Gnome, I really, really want to experience how Gnome works on a proper

1544
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:50,360
tablet because I think it would be a very good experience of having a full desktop into

1545
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:55,600
a tablet with a good desktop environment that integrates both ideas.

1546
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,840
So I think it's a good idea.

1547
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:00,320
Toby, what are your thoughts on it?

1548
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:06,400
As someone who worked on a product which landed on a tablet that got some interesting feedback

1549
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:13,080
recently, I would say the thing they need to nail is not just the hardware build quality

1550
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:17,840
but people can be quite forgiving of hardware build quality if it's at the right price

1551
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:24,560
point but what they often can't forgive is poor quality or unfinished software.

1552
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:32,360
If they don't get that nailed, then people who've backed it might revolt slightly.

1553
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:38,960
Do you think they could spend say several months with Gnome 3 Shell and get Gnome Shell

1554
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:43,160
in a state that is usable in a touch environment?

1555
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:45,760
To be fair, I haven't used Gnome Shell for a long time.

1556
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,120
So I don't know what state it's in in a touch environment.

1557
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,480
I haven't got it on any machines that have got a touch screen.

1558
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,480
So I don't know.

1559
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:54,280
And I don't know how touch-oriented.

1560
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:59,000
I know everyone who sees any operating system that has big icons immediately erroneously

1561
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:05,480
thinks it's a touch UI but I don't know how well Gnome Shell is suited to touch at the

1562
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:06,480
moment.

1563
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,480
So I don't know how far they've got to go.

1564
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,680
I just think they need to focus on that quite hard.

1565
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,840
I think it comes down to the apps.

1566
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,520
I think the Shell does okay.

1567
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:17,800
I mean I've used it on like not a great, some like mediocre touch interfaces and like launching

1568
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,360
apps and that kind of stuff is fine.

1569
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:23,440
It'll depend on like, you know, if you use Chromium it'll do well or Chrome, maybe some

1570
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,000
other web browsers less so or similar for the rest of your apps.

1571
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,640
You know, if you're using Linux apps that just aren't going to work with touch, it's

1572
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:29,640
going to be painful.

1573
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:30,640
But…

1574
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:31,640
Yeah.

1575
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,960
What about like gestures and pinching and things like that?

1576
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:38,480
So I have not read through the whole post where they say all the work they did for Gnome

1577
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,200
but I know they did address some of that.

1578
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,920
They also – they said they're going to eventually have optional docking station features

1579
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:48,080
like a power connector, an RJ45 Ethernet port, HDMI out, two USB ports.

1580
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,080
I'm really…

1581
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:53,240
Like how they solved the fan problem with not having a fan.

1582
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,240
Yeah that is nice.

1583
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,240
That was my solution too.

1584
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:58,720
I guess they just adopted my solution from their laptop problem.

1585
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:05,380
Now I look at this and I think to myself it's really, really, really a difficult position

1586
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:12,320
to be in, to be a project out in the open like this, hardware or software, and be crowdfunded

1587
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:16,640
and have to publicly fail a few times, which a lot of companies and a lot of initiatives

1588
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,560
and a lot of projects do.

1589
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,560
But now…

1590
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:20,560
But this is right out in the open.

1591
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,560
Yeah.

1592
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:25,920
This could be Pureism abandoning the laptop line and – like this you could see two ways.

1593
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,720
This could be Pureism abandoning the laptop line and moving over – or not abandoning.

1594
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,980
That's the wrong way to put it.

1595
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:40,360
This is Pureism redirecting their attention and getting distracted by a Shiny and not focusing

1596
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:50,400
on just nailing and really making something good and then moving on to the next thing.

1597
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,520
They feel like they haven't finished the last thing.

1598
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:59,180
But you could also look at it and say this is a company that is recognizing the competitive

1599
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:05,800
landscape and wants to contribute something unique and cater to a market that wants that

1600
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:12,560
product but wants to have some of their essential requirements met.

1601
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,360
And they're recognizing that and saying you know what we couldn't nail this but we think

1602
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:20,360
we can nail that and so we're going to pivot and we're going to try to make that our

1603
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,360
thing.

1604
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,360
That's also reasonable.

1605
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:26,560
If they would actually literally say that then it would be like well you admit your

1606
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,840
mistake but they haven't done so.

1607
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:29,840
Well that's true.

1608
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,840
That's a good point.

1609
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:31,840
Yeah.

1610
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,840
No.

1611
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:33,840
True.

1612
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,840
But I'm just of two minds of this thing.

1613
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,840
Right.

1614
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:36,840
I look at it and I go I don't know.

1615
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,520
It would be really cool to have a Linux tablet that I loved using.

1616
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,520
That would be awesome.

1617
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:41,520
Yeah.

1618
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:46,520
I look at that and I go geez a quad core, micro SD slot, HDMI out, docking station.

1619
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:53,400
If the keyboard clip in business works well and it doesn't feel chintzy then that would

1620
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,400
be great.

1621
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,400
All right.

1622
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,400
Jama Biz.

1623
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,040
I don't know how you say your head on JMA, BBZ.

1624
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,040
Go ahead.

1625
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,040
Your thoughts on crowdfunding.

1626
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,040
Yeah.

1627
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:06,520
I mean with crowdfunding you are essentially not buying a product.

1628
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:11,080
You're just investing in the hope that – and they have managed to get a product out.

1629
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,040
It wasn't very good.

1630
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,840
Hopefully this one will be better.

1631
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:17,320
We'll have to wait and see.

1632
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:21,160
But they are trying and hopefully they're contributing back to knowing that as always

1633
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,320
there's a risk with crowdfunding and people need to be aware of that.

1634
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:31,700
Well I want to say they contacted us after my Librem 15 review which you guys can go

1635
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,120
find on your own.

1636
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:37,240
And they said well would you be willing to try the Librem 13 because we really think

1637
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,560
we did a much better job with the Librem 13.

1638
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:40,860
We got a better hardware partner.

1639
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:42,560
We had a chance to do it better.

1640
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,280
Would you be willing to look at that?

1641
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:50,240
Him and I haught about it because I'm not a big 13-inch laptop guy.

1642
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:54,000
I'm more of a 15-inch laptop person.

1643
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,560
And I was a little burned, right?

1644
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:59,560
I was a little burned by them so I thought that might influence my review.

1645
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:03,680
So what I decided should have Noah review it.

1646
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:07,140
That guy loves 13-inch laptops, loves them.

1647
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:09,760
And he didn't get burned by the 15-inch laptop.

1648
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,400
No skin off his back.

1649
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:15,200
So on this week's episode of the Linux Action Show, on Sunday's episode, we're going to

1650
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,760
review the Librem 13.

1651
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:23,320
It's not that I want to keep doing all these hardware reviews over and over again but every

1652
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:27,240
single day I get an email about the perfect Linux laptop.

1653
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:31,900
And every single week on Reddit I see a thread about the perfect Linux laptop.

1654
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:35,720
And once a month somebody on Hacker News talks about how they have found the perfect Linux

1655
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:36,720
laptop.

1656
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:37,720
It's talked about all the time.

1657
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:40,800
So we're going to look at the Librem 13 on the Linux Action Show and see if they nailed

1658
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,800
that product.

1659
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:46,480
And my estimation is, depending on how well they did that, when they got another chance,

1660
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,960
how well they did on the Librem 13, if they nailed that, if Noah says they did a great

1661
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:50,960
job.

1662
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,360
Because that is really the test is like you just need to keep some amount of people that

1663
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,040
will keep funding them and letting them progress.

1664
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,440
And the brown bear loves himself the 13-inch laptop.

1665
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:05,100
So if they nailed the 13-inch laptop then I think this might be a viable project.

1666
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,920
You could rely on them to really be able to iterate on something.

1667
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:08,920
So we'll see.

1668
01:15:08,920 --> 01:15:09,920
I don't know.

1669
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,920
I specifically asked him not to really give me any details about it.

1670
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:13,360
I want to find out during the show.

1671
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,720
So he's had it for like three weeks or something.

1672
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,360
Sounds like a good one to watch live.

1673
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,360
Yeah.

1674
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:19,840
Which has been interesting because he's received like maybe four.

1675
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:20,840
I don't know.

1676
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:21,840
He's had it for a while.

1677
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,540
And he got it like during the Oryx.

1678
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:25,760
So he's had the Oryx and the Librem side by side.

1679
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:26,760
Yeah.

1680
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,000
It should be a really interesting review.

1681
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,560
So we'll talk about that on Sunday's show.

1682
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:36,600
But we'll have links to this crowdfunding campaign if you want to go get yourself one.

1683
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,600
Maybe just hang out.

1684
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,160
I think it's got two months.

1685
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:41,720
It's a long one.

1686
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:46,240
So maybe just wait for a little bit and see where it goes.

1687
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:50,560
If you want to support something today, check this out, Wes, patreon.com slash today.

1688
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:51,720
That's where you go to fund the network.

1689
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,780
Now this page is all jacked up.

1690
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:55,960
It's got like stuff on there about Tech Talk today.

1691
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:00,040
It's got a video of me with like an old hairstyle, which is just hard to look at.

1692
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,040
How to date.

1693
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,040
90s.

1694
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,040
Whew.

1695
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:05,000
But none of that matters.

1696
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Go there anyway.

1697
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
What it's really about-

1698
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Put your credit card in.

1699
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,000
What is-

1700
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Chris, put on the confusion thing.

1701
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I'm putting it right now.

1702
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I'm putting it there.

1703
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Okay.

1704
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Wait.

1705
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,000
No.

1706
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Nothing.

1707
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,000
Nothing.

1708
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Let's go to the hallway.

1709
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Yeah.

1710
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Okay.

1711
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Hold on, Wes.

1712
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
We'll go to the hallway.

1713
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Hold on, Wes.

1714
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
We're on the hallway.

1715
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Just you and me.

1716
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Nobody's here.

1717
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Tell them about Patreon.

1718
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,400
Patreon.com slash today.

1719
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,480
This is where you go to support the Jupiter Broadcasting Network and orient our compass

1720
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,160
towards our audience.

1721
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:36,520
Now I say that in a really kind of nice, fancy way, right?

1722
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,800
Orient our compass towards our audience.

1723
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,800
What does that really mean?

1724
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:39,800
I'll tell you, Wes.

1725
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:40,800
Well, it's just because we're out in the hallway.

1726
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,800
It's just you and me.

1727
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:42,800
Tell us, Chris.

1728
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,800
If we were in the hallway, I wouldn't say this.

1729
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,800
Tell us now.

1730
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,680
Advertising on the web is only going to work for so long.

1731
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,920
It's eventually going to go bust.

1732
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,400
I'll say it right now.

1733
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:58,920
And if you've read the New York Times recently, you know that NPR and a bunch of other podcast

1734
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:02,360
advertising brokers are going to screw it all up for all of us.

1735
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,820
They're really messing it up bad.

1736
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:08,040
They want Apple to create its own garden system around podcasting.

1737
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:12,960
Google Play now has its own walled garden that has its own stats and re-hosts our files.

1738
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,840
It is, Wes, if we weren't out in the hallway right now, right now legitimately standing

1739
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,640
in the hallway, I wouldn't say this.

1740
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,120
It ain't going to work much longer.

1741
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:26,440
That's why I think we've talked about crowdfunding today from a multiple set of angles.

1742
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,840
I think this is a big one.

1743
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:34,360
What it really does is it makes your priority your crowdfunding source.

1744
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,960
Your priority is going to be what your funding source is.

1745
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,320
That I think is really all you need to know.

1746
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:43,640
And we want our priority to be the audience, patreon.com slash today.

1747
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:47,520
Now I don't want to say more than that because we're in the hallway.

1748
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,600
If we were in a different room, I might say something else.

1749
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,480
But that's all I want to say about it.

1750
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:56,280
You might also find an extended live edition of this show.

1751
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:00,040
Extended live.

1752
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:03,160
Extended live edition of this show at patreon.com slash today.

1753
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:04,160
Full featured.

1754
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,160
601 patrons.

1755
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,160
That's really great.

1756
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,160
We're getting close.

1757
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:09,560
Well, by close I mean we need to double that.

1758
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:14,760
But once we double that, subscribe again, then three times, then I'll do all these shows

1759
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:15,760
topless.

1760
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,760
Oh, boy.

1761
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:26,600
Or, or pay five dollars more than that and Chris wears two shirts.

1762
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,600
Oh, man.

1763
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,320
I was waiting to see what you'd say about that.

1764
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,320
No, I'm kidding.

1765
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,480
But patreon.com slash today.

1766
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:36,800
We are beginning to post the live recordings of our shows.

1767
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,800
The whole thing.

1768
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,800
I love it.

1769
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:39,800
I was already recording the live stream.

1770
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:40,800
Were you really?

1771
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,800
Oh, yeah.

1772
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,800
Well, it's more fun.

1773
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,360
I love the live stream.

1774
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,360
They are better, right?

1775
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,240
And sometimes I can't be there or I'm out and about or whatever.

1776
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,300
And so now you guys do all the hard work for me.

1777
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:53,080
And since I'm a patron already, like, it's an awesome benefit.

1778
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,360
Yeah, it's an early system.

1779
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:55,360
We're still setting it up.

1780
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,860
But if you want to get in on it, what essentially it lets you do is we're posting a few shows

1781
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:00,960
throughout the week, the entire live stream.

1782
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:06,640
Now I think it's funny because I don't know if people really like jumped on it, but I

1783
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:12,500
posted the tech snap one and that's the first time we have ever showed any live clips.

1784
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,280
We've never do outtakes in tech snap.

1785
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,360
It's nothing like that filtered out.

1786
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,560
It's just what's in there.

1787
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:22,640
And the moment, my favorite moment in that, and it's right there if you're a patron, is

1788
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:27,420
it starts with Alan troubleshooting his microphone.

1789
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:36,240
And what is revealed is that A, Alan Jude has a favorite USB port and B, Alan Jude broke

1790
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:38,660
his favorite USB port.

1791
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:40,600
And so the whole thing is quite funny.

1792
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:44,300
And it's just it's a brilliant example of what happens on the live stream before tech

1793
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:47,220
snap that no one ever sees unless you make it.

1794
01:19:47,220 --> 01:19:48,760
Totally different show.

1795
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:52,960
And now with this new Linux powered OBS rig we have here doing this extra work and all

1796
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,480
these extra sat coms we got going, we thought now is the point.

1797
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,440
Now we can finally contribute back to our patrons.

1798
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:05,240
And we specifically had a milestone we wanted to reach to be able to financially do that.

1799
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,360
And it worked out perfectly.

1800
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:10,760
As we crossed that milestone, the hardware went into place.

1801
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:11,760
That's awesome.

1802
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,040
And now we're delivering those exclusives to our patrons.

1803
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,040
Patreon.com slash today.

1804
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,040
You start at the three dollar level.

1805
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:18,200
You go all the way up, they got swag levels, we got all that.

1806
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,480
Them people over there are crazy.

1807
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:23,440
Just ignore everything else on the page that doesn't well, you actually it's been getting

1808
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,440
updated over time.

1809
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,000
It's been getting quite fancied up.

1810
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,600
We got like a new cord cutting level.

1811
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:29,600
If you're a cord cutter.

1812
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,600
Yeah, like your Netflix.

1813
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,600
$10 or more.

1814
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,600
Yeah, read that.

1815
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:35,200
You're a cord cutter.

1816
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:39,060
You decided mainstream cable isn't how you want to consume content anymore.

1817
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:42,680
And it turns out J.B. has just what you need.

1818
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:46,400
This level means you support content that is tailored to your technical needs and you

1819
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,720
are still saving money.

1820
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:48,720
That's true.

1821
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:49,720
Ten dollars a month is nothing.

1822
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:50,720
Yeah, I know.

1823
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:51,720
Right.

1824
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:52,720
I know.

1825
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:53,720
So check it out.

1826
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:54,720
Patreon.com slash today.

1827
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:55,720
You support the whole network.

1828
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:00,240
And we have big things coming that we want to accomplish in 2016 that I feel like now

1829
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:01,240
you've proven it right.

1830
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:03,760
Like you've shown like you give more money, you get more.

1831
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:04,760
I feel like we have.

1832
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:09,240
I feel like we've delivered and I want Chris to go live in an RV and travel around the

1833
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:10,240
country.

1834
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:11,240
Bam.

1835
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:12,240
He'll do it.

1836
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:14,840
But what really it's about is it's not about me.

1837
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:19,360
It is it is about being able to launch new shows and not have to think about sponsors

1838
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,360
first.

1839
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:23,840
It's about being able to determine what what six hundred and one people like, not what

1840
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,320
a hundred thousand people might like.

1841
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:28,760
See, one of the fundamental problems we have at the Jupiter Broadcasting Network and it

1842
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:34,560
is literally our biggest competitive disadvantage is we cover Linux and open source.

1843
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,080
And it's the stuff we love and that's why we cover it.

1844
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:39,320
But it is the niche of the niche.

1845
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,400
Technology podcasting is a niche.

1846
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,700
Open source and Linux is a niche within that.

1847
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:47,920
Like Mac and Windows are niches within that category.

1848
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:52,200
Imagine right where desktop Linux and the concerns of the open source community fit

1849
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:54,240
within that overall consumer market.

1850
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:55,240
We're tiny.

1851
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:56,240
We're absolutely tiny.

1852
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,960
And that's why you don't see us often featured in iTunes.

1853
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:02,880
That's why you don't necessarily see us listed in Pocket Cast network list.

1854
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,440
Because you'll see you'll see tight you'll see networks that literally get half the downloads

1855
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:11,220
we get listed there simply because they cover topics that appeal to a wider audience.

1856
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:15,760
So one of our major competitive disadvantages is that we talk about Linux and open source.

1857
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:19,440
But at the same time, that's our biggest competitive advantage because that's all we're really

1858
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:20,440
about.

1859
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:22,160
We really dig into that stuff on these shows.

1860
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:26,040
And if you enjoy that content, if that is something that's provided value to you or

1861
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:30,760
something that you just have listened to over and over again and enjoyed, patreon.com slash

1862
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:35,480
today we need you because we do not have the advantages that some of the other podcast

1863
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:42,040
networks have by covering Apple and iPhones and everything Google does and all of that

1864
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:47,400
extra crap that we're all sick and tired of hearing about all the time.

1865
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:52,400
And so that's why we're really, really hoping that we can funnel more attention to our Patreon

1866
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:57,280
and grow that because that really then unhinges us and allows us to go cray cray cray cray

1867
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,280
Wes.

1868
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:01,440
And it's great to have a system like Patreon where you really can just give money right

1869
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:04,920
to the awesome people who make the show and you get a little extra bonuses.

1870
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:08,060
Patreon.com slash today.

1871
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:11,600
Thank you everybody who does support us.

1872
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:15,040
And that brings us to the end of this week's episode of The Unplugged Program.

1873
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,080
Oh Wes.

1874
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,720
I feel like we could go on more and more.

1875
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:22,620
The whole episode had a thread through it and I find that to be interesting since it's

1876
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:24,320
not really intentional with this show.

1877
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:29,960
This is The Unplugged Program and you can hang out with us live over at jblive.tv, JupiterBroadcasting.com

1878
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:33,640
slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone.

1879
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:37,080
If you want to think bots do it, I'll let you believe that.

1880
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,080
I'll let you believe that.

1881
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,080
It's fine.

1882
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,700
We have a mumble room if you want to participate in our virtual lug.

1883
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:46,160
And last but not least, we love your feedback at linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1884
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,160
Join us in the hallway.

1885
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:51,600
All right everybody, thank you so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Unplugged.

1886
01:23:51,600 --> 01:24:18,480
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

1887
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:40,760
All right, so before we start the show, Mr. Corpse brought it up in the mumble room and

1888
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:41,760
it's amazing.

1889
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,040
Holy smokes.

1890
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,960
When I got on the live stream today, this was still at three million.

1891
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,520
It's already at four million.

1892
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:51,440
Wow, so this is the Pebble 2, Time 2 and the new Pebble Core.

1893
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:55,040
It already has 21,000 backers with 36 days left to go.

1894
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,640
They had a goal of a million dollars.

1895
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:03,400
They've now raised four million dollars and this is very perfect timing because some of

1896
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:07,160
the discussions we're going to get into today are very much around open source projects

1897
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:11,760
like the Mycroft device and others that are open crowd funded.

1898
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:15,800
Open source, open different, not necessarily Kickstarter, but different methodologies of

1899
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,800
funding.

1900
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,760
This is one of the all-time big names on Kickstarter launching this today.

1901
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,520
I think it's kind of perfect timing.

1902
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:29,800
I don't hear anything though, it's all screwed up.

1903
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,160
I don't know what happened there.

1904
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:36,040
That was really signed up pretty well too, it's kind of a shame.

1905
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,040
I don't know.

1906
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,040
Let's go HTML5.

1907
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:42,160
Damn it Linux, why are you doing this to me now?

1908
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,160
What's going on baby?

1909
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:44,160
Don't you love me?

1910
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:45,160
Don't you love me Linux?

1911
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:57,480
You know I watched this not 35 minutes ago and we're just fine.

1912
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:00,920
Mustaches dude, mustaches.

1913
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:04,680
Well okay let's bust it out, let's go into the lab, let's figure out what's going on

1914
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:05,680
here.

1915
01:26:05,680 --> 01:26:08,840
I'm going to pop and lock my audio interface.

1916
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:13,440
Stand by, live hotswap in progress.

1917
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:25,920
Okay, hold on, hold on, reswapping, utilizing gnome extension to re-default, sound interface

1918
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:34,520
recognized, original output selected, refreshing web page, activating video.

1919
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:38,040
Hey, I did it, nice.

1920
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:39,760
I want to reset that up in purpose.

1921
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,400
You're an IT wizard.

1922
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:55,400
Not only did that solve the problem, but there were sound effects and live commentary.

1923
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:58,520
See that's how you know I used to do IT, right there.

1924
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:03,080
Okay now shut up Wes, we're going to start over again because I want that S to be smooth,

1925
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,080
okay?

1926
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,080
All right?

1927
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:06,080
Okay?

1928
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,080
Man.

1929
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:21,440
I almost blew that ass Wes.

1930
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,520
Now this is almost perfect timing for the big show today.

1931
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:27,600
Wait no that's not, damn it, see now I'm all off.

1932
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:28,600
Damn, man.

1933
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,600
We're the cute little show.

1934
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:32,200
OMG, OMG, OMG.

1935
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:36,760
I'm too warm Wes, I'm too warm.

1936
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:37,760
All right, fine.

1937
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:38,760
Hear what?

1938
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:39,760
The jacket's coming off.

1939
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:43,360
Even though I love this matte jacket, which Wes commented on, it's a nice Ubuntu matte

1940
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:48,240
jacket that was sent to me by Mr. Wimpy and I really like it.

1941
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:53,400
And it was pleasant in here until the damn log guy started doing his thing.

1942
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:58,240
So now, if y'all can get your crap together, we're going to start over, okay?

1943
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:11,040
And we're not going to call it the big show.
