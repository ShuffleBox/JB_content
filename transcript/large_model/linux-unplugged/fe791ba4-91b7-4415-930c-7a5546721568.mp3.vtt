WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.020
Well, the reason why I was asking if producer rotten corpse was here is because he had a

00:06.020 --> 00:10.160
write up that was pretty cool over at make use of dot com about the easy way to watch

00:10.160 --> 00:12.060
Netflix on Linux spoiler alert.

00:12.060 --> 00:13.060
Really the easy way.

00:13.060 --> 00:15.360
Do you know what it is, Wes?

00:15.360 --> 00:16.360
Install Chrome.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.360
Install Chrome.

00:17.360 --> 00:18.360
How could he?

00:18.360 --> 00:19.360
How could it be easier?

00:19.360 --> 00:20.360
Mm hmm.

00:20.360 --> 00:21.360
Yeah.

00:21.360 --> 00:22.360
But he walks through that and he also walks through a couple other options you have, like

00:22.360 --> 00:26.840
breaking it off into its own desktop application and the issue where it is with where it's out

00:26.840 --> 00:28.200
on Firefox and things like that.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.200
So that's really cool.

00:29.200 --> 00:33.160
But we actually had an email into Linux Unplugged just this week that was asking how to get

00:33.160 --> 00:34.160
Netflix running again.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.440
So I thought, boy, what a great chance to mention that.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.480
And then kind of great timing.

00:38.480 --> 00:44.320
Also Joey on OMG Ubuntu has a how to watch Hulu on Ubuntu 14.04, which includes installing

00:44.320 --> 00:48.740
HAL, I guess, because flash DRM doesn't work on Ubuntu without that.

00:48.740 --> 00:52.120
So it goes through how to get that going on Ubuntu 14.04 or later.

00:52.120 --> 00:56.480
So Hulu on Linux and Netflix use Hulu, you know, only occasionally.

00:56.480 --> 00:58.780
So I'd be glad to have a guy like this.

00:58.780 --> 01:01.140
Have you read that article carefully?

01:01.140 --> 01:03.760
You've spotted anything familiar at all in that article?

01:03.760 --> 01:04.760
Let me see.

01:04.760 --> 01:05.960
I actually just pulled it up right here.

01:05.960 --> 01:06.960
I'm noticing.

01:06.960 --> 01:07.960
Let's see.

01:07.960 --> 01:08.960
I can add an Ubuntu PPA here.

01:08.960 --> 01:09.960
It's very nice.

01:09.960 --> 01:10.960
I can stall.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.000
What am I missing as I peruse through it?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Is there PPA?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Is it whose PPA?

01:15.000 --> 01:18.520
Well, I noticed that that's actually what jumped out at me to tell you the truth.

01:18.520 --> 01:19.520
But I don't know.

01:19.520 --> 01:24.440
I mean, is that how do you say a flexi on dot org flexi on flexi?

01:24.440 --> 01:25.440
Tell us about that, Wimpy.

01:25.440 --> 01:26.440
Tell us about that.

01:26.440 --> 01:27.440
That's me.

01:27.440 --> 01:28.440
Yeah.

01:28.440 --> 01:29.440
Yeah.

01:29.440 --> 01:35.560
Are you is this an issue that you've been working on for Ubuntu Mate edition or what

01:35.560 --> 01:36.560
is what's going on here?

01:36.560 --> 01:37.560
What's

01:37.560 --> 01:38.560
Yeah.

01:38.560 --> 01:39.560
Yeah.

01:39.560 --> 01:40.560
It's built into Ubuntu Mate.

01:40.560 --> 01:41.560
Oh, that's beautiful.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.560
Gosh, I love that.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.560
I love that.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.560
I say it's built.

01:44.560 --> 01:45.560
I say it's built in.

01:45.560 --> 01:47.560
So actually, I found the upstream project some months ago.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.240
Oh, here's the credit to you right here.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.240
Very nice.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.240
Very good.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.240
Good for Joey for pointing that out.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.240
I like that.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.240
Yeah.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.240
Well deserved.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.240
Yeah.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.720
So the upstream project has done all the hard work.

01:58.720 --> 02:05.560
All I did was add some packaging for Debian and Ubuntu and chuck it in a PPA.

02:05.560 --> 02:11.440
And in Ubuntu Mate welcome, when you install Adobe Flash, it automatically pulls in that

02:11.440 --> 02:16.680
Hal Flash plugin as well, so that you get all the good stuff baked in.

02:16.680 --> 02:21.940
And what I'm currently working on is getting that into the Debian archives.

02:21.940 --> 02:27.600
So then it appears in Ubuntu official archives, and everyone's got access to it.

02:27.600 --> 02:32.820
Jeez, you are really making that a great out-of-the-box experience for regular users.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.000
That is super cool, Wimpy.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.640
But now everybody else can take advantage of it too.

02:36.640 --> 02:37.640
The secret is unleashed.

02:37.640 --> 02:38.640
Mwa ha ha ha.

02:38.640 --> 02:39.640
For all of you who want to watch it.

02:39.640 --> 02:40.640
That is no secret.

02:40.640 --> 02:45.920
I've been rather poorly doing the job of trying to publicize this.

02:45.920 --> 02:51.840
And Stuart Langridge has been poking fun at me every time he's found the alternative methods

02:51.840 --> 02:53.920
in the online press.

02:53.920 --> 02:59.560
So I was very pleased that Joey actually did the job that was somewhere down my list of

02:59.560 --> 03:00.560
things to do.

03:00.560 --> 03:01.560
Very good.

03:01.560 --> 03:02.560
Which is actually write this up.

03:02.560 --> 03:03.560
Yeah.

03:03.560 --> 03:04.560
So yeah, he's done me a favor there.

03:04.560 --> 03:05.560
Yeah.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.560
Very nice.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.560
And now others can take advantage of it.

03:07.560 --> 03:08.560
Maybe we'll try it out later.

03:08.560 --> 03:09.560
Yeah.

03:09.560 --> 03:27.160
All right, this is Linux Unplugged episode 110 for September 15th, 2015.

03:27.160 --> 03:32.240
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's just about to hit the road.

03:32.240 --> 03:33.240
My name is Chris.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.240
My name is Wes.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.240
Hey there, Wes.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.880
So I am all stoked to talk about today's episode.

03:37.880 --> 03:41.720
It's funny because our pre-show, we were kind of talking about online streaming, but really

03:41.720 --> 03:47.160
in today's episode, we're going to have an emphasis on offline life like you're online.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.440
I like that.

03:48.440 --> 03:52.280
It's all the things we're used to in the modern era, but without a connection.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.280
Exactly.

03:53.280 --> 03:54.280
That's my world right now.

03:54.280 --> 03:58.080
And so we're going to cover a couple of really great, well, actually more than a couple of

03:58.080 --> 04:02.160
really great open source projects that help you live completely offline, but enjoy some

04:02.160 --> 04:03.600
of the perks of being online.

04:03.600 --> 04:10.640
Of course, we're also going to get into a block level backup system that is a little

04:10.640 --> 04:12.400
bit cooler than LVM snapshots.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.720
It gives you copy on write essentially to any file system.

04:15.720 --> 04:19.240
It even works with ButterFS if you want to use it with ButterFS and it looks like it

04:19.240 --> 04:21.440
just runs in the background transparently.

04:21.440 --> 04:23.280
We're going to tell you a little bit about that coming up in the show.

04:23.280 --> 04:27.440
And then also we've been talking about Munich and their big Linux switch and all of the

04:27.440 --> 04:31.200
news that's been coming out of that on the Linux action show for about three weeks now.

04:31.200 --> 04:35.320
And we're going to give the final word to our virtual lug as we say goodbye to the Munich

04:35.320 --> 04:38.760
story with how they contribute upstream to open source.

04:38.760 --> 04:43.480
We'll cover that in today's episode, plus a little update on the impending road show

04:43.480 --> 04:46.440
and some really, really great feedback.

04:46.440 --> 04:49.160
So we have a whole bunch of stuff to get into.

04:49.160 --> 04:52.800
So before we go any further, we should probably totally bring in that mumble room.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.480
Time appropriate greetings in virtual lug.

04:54.480 --> 04:55.480
Hey, Pep.

04:55.480 --> 04:56.480
Hey, Pep.

04:56.480 --> 04:57.480
Hello.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.480
Hello.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.480
There they are.

04:59.480 --> 05:00.480
Hello, everybody.

05:00.480 --> 05:01.480
So guess what?

05:01.480 --> 05:02.480
Guess what?

05:02.480 --> 05:04.960
We got to get right into it today because we have lots of stuff to cover.

05:04.960 --> 05:08.400
So I want to start with the emails that have been coming to Linux Unplugged.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.720
Dow wrote in with a name for the road show.

05:11.720 --> 05:12.720
Here's my contribution.

05:12.720 --> 05:13.720
Love all the shows.

05:13.720 --> 05:14.720
Good luck with the endeavor.

05:14.720 --> 05:18.100
He says we should call it the Finding Linux Roadshow.

05:18.100 --> 05:23.960
So in Linux action show, we named the mobile studio the JB Rover, Rover for short.

05:23.960 --> 05:25.440
Now we have to name this tour.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.280
Each road show will have its own name.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.280
Each tour will have its own name.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.800
So we can refer to it as that.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.480
So Dow suggests we're going to name it.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.800
We're going to decide today on Linux Unplugged what it is.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.240
So yeah, we're going to vote and decide.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.760
So Dow says we should name it the Finding Linux Roadshow.

05:37.760 --> 05:41.840
And that's a good idea because I do plan everywhere I go to try to find if they use Linux.

05:41.840 --> 05:42.840
Everywhere I go.

05:42.840 --> 05:43.840
So that's not bad.

05:43.840 --> 05:44.840
The Finding Linux Roadshow.

05:44.840 --> 05:45.840
That's not bad.

05:45.840 --> 05:46.840
Not bad.

05:46.840 --> 05:47.840
But we have more.

05:47.840 --> 05:48.840
Hold on.

05:48.840 --> 05:49.840
Hold your thoughts.

05:49.840 --> 05:50.840
Because Terry writes in with a few names for the road show.

05:50.840 --> 05:52.200
Now get ready for these ones, Wes.

05:52.200 --> 05:55.440
The Very Open Roadshow, or VORCE for short.

05:55.440 --> 06:03.440
The Wide Open Roadshow, or VORCE for short, the Linux Open Roadshow, or Linux on the Move.

06:03.440 --> 06:07.740
So those are a couple of submissions there.

06:07.740 --> 06:10.400
And what I'm going to suggest is while we talk about this a little more, I'm going to

06:10.400 --> 06:13.760
submit, this will be in the show notes as well, I'm going to submit this to the chat

06:13.760 --> 06:15.960
room for voting.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.440
Put them all in there.

06:17.440 --> 06:18.440
You guys go vote.

06:18.440 --> 06:19.440
I got to say, so J.B.

06:19.440 --> 06:23.940
Rover was the mobile studio name, but Jupiter 2 was a very common popular suggestion.

06:23.940 --> 06:26.660
So I have a poll up right now for naming the road show.

06:26.660 --> 06:29.000
This will go on while we do the rest of the show.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.860
And chat room and Mumba room, if you could vote away, I just put the link in the show

06:31.860 --> 06:36.680
notes, strawpoll.me, slash 5496571.

06:36.680 --> 06:37.680
And we get to vote.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.340
See if we got any votes yet.

06:39.340 --> 06:45.320
Finding Linux is the Finding Linux Roadshow, and Last Cribs Roadshow is also up there for

06:45.320 --> 06:46.320
voting.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.320
Because remember, I'm going to Noah's house.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.660
I'm going to do a Last Cribs episode.

06:48.660 --> 06:49.660
So there you go.

06:49.660 --> 06:53.440
And then one more email kind of in this, and we'll let the votes continue.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.280
Alex wrote in asking the following.

06:55.280 --> 06:59.240
He says, for the road show, I heard you might be passing by Colorado.

06:59.240 --> 07:02.720
In case that is so, it would be great if you'd like to come by for a beer at a microboo.

07:02.720 --> 07:03.720
Oh, cool.

07:03.720 --> 07:04.720
All right.

07:04.720 --> 07:05.720
Well, hold on to that thought there, Alex.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.720
But here's the second thing.

07:06.720 --> 07:10.560
He says, this week, I was at a student's meeting of Linux users at the university.

07:10.560 --> 07:14.000
And it was great to see so many people that were interested in Linux.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.220
They helped installing Mint or whoever liked to try Linux out.

07:17.220 --> 07:18.960
Some of them were even running Arch.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.200
There were around 10 to 15 people.

07:21.200 --> 07:22.200
Perhaps you'd like to meet them.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.440
They're a new generation of Linux users.

07:24.440 --> 07:25.680
So maybe I could meet them when I come back.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.120
That might be a fun thing to do.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.120
Yeah.

07:28.120 --> 07:31.320
So Alex asked about meeting up in Colorado.

07:31.320 --> 07:37.480
And Alex, so right now, we may actually end up going through Colorado on the return trip.

07:37.480 --> 07:39.560
But that's all a little tentative at the moment.

07:39.560 --> 07:44.000
So if you go to meetup.com slash jupyterbroadcasting, we have Odyssey West right here in the Mumble

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
Room.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.040
He's going to be setting up some Mumble, or I'm sorry, some meetups as we go along.

07:49.040 --> 07:52.000
And you'll be able to see where we're at, because we're going to have a Jupiter Broadcast.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.520
We already have jupyterbroadcasting.com slash rover set up.

07:55.520 --> 07:59.240
It's a live tracker of the journey of where the rover is at.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.640
So you'll be able to see what town it's at.

08:00.640 --> 08:05.360
And you'll be able to tweet me or email rover at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.360
Rover at Jupiter Broadcasting.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.360
Very own email.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.360
I love it.

08:08.360 --> 08:09.360
Yep.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.360
Rover at Jupiter Broadcasting is great for trailer tips.

08:10.360 --> 08:13.760
A lot of people are emailing in with suggestions and tips for the trailer.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.040
If you want to meet up on the road, we'll be checking that inbox.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.080
And all that kind of stuff can go to rover at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.600
It's also on the contact page.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.720
And if you go to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash rover, you can see where the rover is in real

08:25.720 --> 08:26.720
time.

08:26.720 --> 08:27.720
Odyssey Westridge is going to have access to that, too.

08:27.720 --> 08:30.240
And he'll be able to set up some meetups and things like that.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.840
So meetup.com slash jupyterbroadcasting if you want to meet up along the way.

08:33.840 --> 08:35.560
Because, Alex, I think that'd be really cool.

08:35.560 --> 08:36.560
I'd like that.

08:36.560 --> 08:37.960
So let's try to get that set up.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.840
So let's check in with the votes one more time.

08:40.840 --> 08:41.840
Ooh.

08:41.840 --> 08:42.840
Ooh.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.600
Last Cribs Roadshow is up to the top.

08:44.600 --> 08:45.600
Look at that.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.400
With 47% of the votes so far, Finding Linux is number two.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.480
And the Linux Open Roadshow is number three.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.480
No votes.

08:52.480 --> 08:56.520
The wide open roadshow and the very open roadshow are getting no votes.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.600
Might be good to keep Finding Linux in your back pocket here.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.080
This one is a Cribs trip.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.080
Yeah.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.080
Right.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.080
Yeah.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.080
Finding Linux.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.080
That's true.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.080
When you're out of ideas and you want to hit the open road, you can just go hunt down

09:06.080 --> 09:07.080
Linux.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.080
That's true.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.080
That's good.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.080
Finding Linux could apply to a future road trip.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.000
Not that we should be influencing the votes, Wes.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Certainly not.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Please.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Please.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Just disregard everything.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
That's just standing order.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Yeah.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
So there you go.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Let's see what happens.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.200
And then by the end of this episode, maybe we'll have a name.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.200
We'll see what.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.200
We'll see.

09:23.200 --> 09:26.320
If the votes are really super clear about it, we'll see if we have a name.

09:26.320 --> 09:30.240
So this is the last Linux Unplugged recording in studio.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.240
You'll be in studio.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.240
Yeah.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.240
But I will not be in studio starting next week.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.320
I'll be on the road.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.400
And there's definitely a few things still to work out.

09:37.400 --> 09:42.760
I don't actually have all of the studio itself assembled in the RV yet.

09:42.760 --> 09:46.560
And I have disgusting tank issues that need to be worked out.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.560
Extra baggage.

09:47.560 --> 09:48.560
Extra baggage.

09:48.560 --> 09:49.560
Yeah.

09:49.560 --> 09:50.560
Yeah.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.920
There are a few things that are just really kind of still up in the air.

09:53.920 --> 09:54.980
So it's a little crazy.

09:54.980 --> 10:00.240
And I still have, you know, before I leave on Saturday, I still have unfiltered two tech

10:00.240 --> 10:03.920
snaps and a Linux action show to record and see if I can fit in a tech talk.

10:03.920 --> 10:04.920
So it's going to be nuts.

10:04.920 --> 10:05.920
It's going to be good.

10:05.920 --> 10:06.920
It's going to be nuts.

10:06.920 --> 10:07.920
That's all I'm saying.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.920
And you know, speaking of the road trip, and then we'll start.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.520
Let's talk about Munich.

10:11.520 --> 10:15.800
I am really excited to say that right before we started the show, my first I'm going to

10:15.800 --> 10:20.480
get I'm going to have two Ting MiFi devices and they just sent me one of the CDMA devices.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.240
But I'm going to use on the road.

10:22.240 --> 10:26.180
So I'll have Ting sponsored connectivity while I'm on the go, thankfully, which is going

10:26.180 --> 10:27.760
to solve a huge part of the problem.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.760
That's amazing.

10:28.760 --> 10:29.760
Yeah, it's really great.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.200
And you know, right now Ting is doing a $50 promo for the month of September.

10:32.200 --> 10:36.240
If you go to Linux.ting.com, that'll support this show and give you $50 off Ting service

10:36.240 --> 10:37.240
for you.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.560
Ting is pay for what you use mobile.

10:39.560 --> 10:42.580
It's $6 a line and then just your usage on top of that.

10:42.580 --> 10:43.580
That's how Ting works.

10:43.580 --> 10:46.240
They have a really great dashboard and they have no hold customer service.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.520
And that's the core recipe of Ting.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.880
And they really make they make this super, super valuable.

10:50.880 --> 10:55.260
Like it is unbelievable with three lines and paying like $40 a month for three smartphones.

10:55.260 --> 10:56.260
It's amazing.

10:56.260 --> 10:59.280
And the nice thing is if you need like a MiFi device, you just need data from time to time,

10:59.280 --> 11:02.060
Ting could be a great, great solution for you because it's just $6 for the line.

11:02.060 --> 11:04.100
You can even suspend the line when you're not using it.

11:04.100 --> 11:07.900
Go to Linux.ting.com and click on that how much you would save and put your deets in

11:07.900 --> 11:11.240
there and check them out because they've got a CDMA and GSM network.

11:11.240 --> 11:14.080
They have a lot of coverage you can choose from and that also means there's a lot of

11:14.080 --> 11:15.080
devices you can use.

11:15.080 --> 11:18.440
In fact, very likely you might have already a Ting compatible device, in which case you'll

11:18.440 --> 11:20.120
get a $50 service credit.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.320
And they have some devices that are just absolutely unbelievable.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.400
Like right now the Galaxy S6 is on sale.

11:24.400 --> 11:28.040
The Blue Studio 6LTE is on sale and look at the Kyocero Duro XT.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.920
I think that thing could survive like an alien attack.

11:30.920 --> 11:31.920
It's so cool.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.440
Forty seven dollars for a feature phone and the battery just lasts forever.

11:34.440 --> 11:37.520
And Noah was saying that the speaker on that thing is so loud, too, that that's a really

11:37.520 --> 11:39.480
nice feature because it's designed for construction sites.

11:39.480 --> 11:43.000
So a lot of good phones, everything from the feature phones up to the latest and greatest

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
devices.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.160
And you know the Karma Go is new and I've been looking at that Karma Go.

11:48.160 --> 11:49.160
That might be what they sent me.

11:49.160 --> 11:50.160
I don't know.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.040
They either sent me that or the neck ear unit.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.040
I'm not quite sure which one I got.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.520
To show them off on some future updates.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.520
Totally, totally.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.580
Yeah, there's a great range of devices to pick from including all the iPhone devices,

11:59.580 --> 12:04.080
the latest Android devices and you can get that $50 credit by going to linux.ting.com.

12:04.080 --> 12:05.080
Check them out.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.080
Take a read at their blog.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.080
Try their savings calculator.

12:07.080 --> 12:10.560
I think you're going to be impressed on how different a mobile company can be.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.960
It's a really cool setup and Ting's a unique company backed by a great company, Two Cows.

12:13.960 --> 12:14.960
You're probably familiar with them.

12:14.960 --> 12:18.160
You can go to linux.ting.com to support the show and get our discount and a big thanks

12:18.160 --> 12:20.720
to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

12:20.720 --> 12:26.520
Okay, so we've covered the Munich switch now for well, for years in Linux Action Show technically.

12:26.520 --> 12:30.960
But in the last couple of weeks, there's been a lot of hoopla around, do the users want

12:30.960 --> 12:31.960
to switch away?

12:31.960 --> 12:32.960
Is it a core group of people?

12:32.960 --> 12:36.020
Or maybe it's just these one group of department department users that want to switch away

12:36.020 --> 12:38.720
and some Microsoft spokespersons.

12:38.720 --> 12:43.560
And in all of this coverage, I think one of the things that came up was holy crap, the

12:43.560 --> 12:46.680
Munich IT department is modifying the Linux that they're using.

12:46.680 --> 12:50.560
I mean, they have Limux and the LibreOffice they're using quite a bit, something like

12:50.560 --> 12:51.560
40 patches to LibreOffice.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.360
Huge patch load to carry.

12:53.360 --> 12:54.360
Yeah.

12:54.360 --> 12:57.960
And a lot of people thought this was a big mistake.

12:57.960 --> 13:02.080
Now one thing we did mention in the show, but I think it kind of got missed is the patches

13:02.080 --> 13:04.640
that they're doing, they are sending upstream.

13:04.640 --> 13:05.640
That's awesome.

13:05.640 --> 13:06.640
That's the way to do it.

13:06.640 --> 13:09.400
So they are, they consider themselves a major contributor to free and open source projects,

13:09.400 --> 13:13.040
sending bug fixes to upstream developers, making available software solutions and sharing

13:13.040 --> 13:14.720
best practices and technical information.

13:14.720 --> 13:15.720
Now this is true.

13:15.720 --> 13:18.280
I know that there are IT folks when they, when some of the things they've discovered

13:18.280 --> 13:21.880
employing large sets of Linux machines they've been sharing.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.800
One of the things they say is the development cycle is long.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.620
And one of the members of the city's Linux client development team was saying that one

13:27.620 --> 13:29.920
of the reasons the wide range of computer hardware is supported.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.880
So this is one of the challenges they have is because the development cycle of Limux

13:32.880 --> 13:37.040
and the applications they use is long, hardware changes fairly quickly.

13:37.040 --> 13:40.440
So they say whatever computer hardware was built in the last 20 years, Munich is running

13:40.440 --> 13:45.020
and it's a central IT department, it's central that the IT department has to support it.

13:45.020 --> 13:49.640
So they have 18,000 PCs, so you can imagine how much hardware breaks per day.

13:49.640 --> 13:53.700
And that's why we always stock half a year's worth of hardware.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.800
And of course sometimes they have to do custom patches to support some of this hardware.

13:56.800 --> 14:02.120
And some of these include patches for like scanners to do certain kinds of document scanning.

14:02.120 --> 14:06.180
They have a web based solution to administer accounts for groups, servers and workstations

14:06.180 --> 14:09.200
with an LDAP distributed directory with information services.

14:09.200 --> 14:13.520
They have fully automated installation services that make software available updates to people,

14:13.520 --> 14:18.480
to all the workstations, over 50 offices across the city.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.520
And they're on the fifth version of Limux, which isn't deployed for everybody but it's

14:21.520 --> 14:22.520
based on Kubuntu.

14:22.520 --> 14:25.600
Now you were just recently playing with automated deployments.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.640
When you hear numbers like this, you know, you look at impressive organizations.

14:28.640 --> 14:33.140
Yeah, that's 18,000 PCs, 50 offices.

14:33.140 --> 14:36.080
When you think of automating something like that, does it boggle the mind a little bit?

14:36.080 --> 14:37.080
It definitely does.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.560
Yeah, I can't even, I mean, you'd have to though.

14:39.560 --> 14:40.560
You would have to.

14:40.560 --> 14:45.060
I mean, and I can understand how they have some legacy needs that perhaps smaller, more

14:45.060 --> 14:47.640
nimble organizations are not buckled down with.

14:47.640 --> 14:48.640
Yeah.

14:48.640 --> 14:49.640
Yeah.

14:49.640 --> 14:55.680
I wanted to kind of mention to you guys though, do you guys have any takeaways from our recent

14:55.680 --> 14:56.680
Munich coverage?

14:56.680 --> 14:59.520
Anything, any gaps that you wanted to fill in on the Munich coverage?

14:59.520 --> 15:00.520
Anybody?

15:00.520 --> 15:04.120
Because I know it's been a popular topic in our subreddit, so I wanted to open it up for

15:04.120 --> 15:06.120
discussion here in the show.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.120
Really?

15:07.120 --> 15:10.360
I've got to figure somebody has an opinion on it.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.640
The only thing that's occurred to me, I mean, I know it's been a long time since they started

15:13.640 --> 15:18.720
this effort, but this day and age, do they need their own distribution?

15:18.720 --> 15:25.480
Could they not find a commercially supported distribution and repurpose that?

15:25.480 --> 15:33.600
Just tweak the applications that are installed and use Ubuntu or OpenSUSE or?

15:33.600 --> 15:36.320
It does sound like they're doing a lot of work to keep up with everything.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.680
It's a lot to keep in house.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.680
They're starting with Ubuntu, yeah.

15:39.680 --> 15:43.360
Yeah, but it's quite old, isn't it?

15:43.360 --> 15:44.360
It is, yeah.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.360
Yeah.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.360
Yeah.

15:46.360 --> 15:51.840
The design of, the only thing that I think is silly is the design that they have of like

15:51.840 --> 15:55.280
a six year cycle between different versions.

15:55.280 --> 16:00.440
So there's at least one year they're guaranteed not to get support and they did that on purpose.

16:00.440 --> 16:05.920
Well if you were going to do it today, wouldn't you almost do it somewhat similar sort of

16:05.920 --> 16:07.660
as your own spin off of the distro?

16:07.660 --> 16:11.320
Like it would be PPAs that you lay down on top of it and things like that.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.600
Isn't that kind of how you would do it if you were going to do it today?

16:13.600 --> 16:16.200
But it would be as close to mainline Ubuntu as possible?

16:16.200 --> 16:17.200
Yeah.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.580
And I would update every two years.

16:19.580 --> 16:20.580
Borky makes a good point.

16:20.580 --> 16:24.520
They're running KDE, so why don't they base this on OpenSUSE?

16:24.520 --> 16:32.120
Yeah, there's like with the studio to spin your own and then the build service to build

16:32.120 --> 16:33.120
the applications.

16:33.120 --> 16:36.440
And maybe you could have different versions for different sets of hardware if you needed

16:36.440 --> 16:37.440
it.

16:37.440 --> 16:43.080
Truly SUSE could really, the SUSE studio and the SUSE builds or open build service could

16:43.080 --> 16:45.320
provide a ton of infrastructure for them.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.320
Yeah.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.360
Well isn't this the risk when you adopt too early?

16:49.360 --> 16:50.360
Did they?

16:50.360 --> 16:51.360
Okay, Wimpy.

16:51.360 --> 16:54.760
But very frankly, did they adopt Linux too early?

16:54.760 --> 17:00.200
No, I wouldn't want to say that because somebody has to sort of take the first step and Munich

17:00.200 --> 17:03.800
have been sort of the shining light for everyone else to follow.

17:03.800 --> 17:08.200
And there have been examples of other organizations and municipalities following their lead.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.120
So I think that's all good.

17:10.120 --> 17:14.960
And I think that what's changed is that the Linux landscape has changed a little bit since

17:14.960 --> 17:17.120
they first set out on this endeavor.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.120
Yeah.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.120
Yeah.

17:19.120 --> 17:20.120
Somebody had to do it.

17:20.120 --> 17:21.120
Yeah.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.440
Somebody at a large scale had to do it.

17:23.440 --> 17:27.040
And it's great to see them contributing some of what they've learned about trying to – hopefully

17:27.040 --> 17:29.920
the next city that adopts it will do a leaner job.

17:29.920 --> 17:34.200
What about my concern though that because they're kind of – I mean I really respect

17:34.200 --> 17:36.840
the work they're doing here and I think it's great that they've taken this on.

17:36.840 --> 17:41.800
But isn't it also not the best example for us?

17:41.800 --> 17:45.560
Because it is sort of an old style of doing an implementation, it feels like every time

17:45.560 --> 17:50.160
the press goes to it every year to look at how it's doing and the story that comes

17:50.160 --> 17:53.440
out is well, they're struggling a little bit but they're still chugging along.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.440
That feels like not a great use case.

17:55.440 --> 17:56.720
It doesn't get you excited about it.

17:56.720 --> 17:57.720
Yeah.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.200
It doesn't make me want to switch my company over if I'm some CTO, right?

18:00.200 --> 18:01.200
Right.

18:01.200 --> 18:05.120
That I worry about a little bit is I'd love to see some of the companies that are out

18:05.120 --> 18:11.060
there that are huge that have switched over to Ubuntu on the desktop that just have massive

18:11.060 --> 18:13.720
deployments and they don't talk about it.

18:13.720 --> 18:14.880
That I would really like to see.

18:14.880 --> 18:18.440
Because I think if more people talked about it, it's like it becomes like part of people's

18:18.440 --> 18:19.440
secret sauce.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.720
It's like it's part of their, what keeps them different.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.520
I don't know what it is, exactly why companies aren't talking about it, but if they would,

18:24.520 --> 18:27.640
I feel like it would feel like it was more commonplace.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.640
But Munich's what we get.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.640
What's that?

18:29.640 --> 18:33.440
I'd like to know where Munich falls on the spectrum of organizations that have really

18:33.440 --> 18:36.600
customized their installation.

18:36.600 --> 18:40.640
Are there entities out there with 18,000 desktops that just take Ubuntu or Red Hat out of the

18:40.640 --> 18:41.640
box?

18:41.640 --> 18:45.000
Well, we know there's gubuntu, so we know Ubuntu's, or I mean we know Google is modifying

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Ubuntu.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.360
I feel like we also miss out on some of the maybe enterprise that have some Linux deployment

18:51.360 --> 18:52.360
on the desktop.

18:52.360 --> 18:56.560
You know, like maybe developers and some of the IT staff, maybe not the accountants.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.040
Yeah, for sure.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.860
I'm sure that happens quite a bit.

19:00.860 --> 19:02.920
And if you watch Mr. Robot, apparently everybody runs Linux.

19:02.920 --> 19:04.720
You ever watch Mr. Robot, that show?

19:04.720 --> 19:05.720
Only the first episode.

19:05.720 --> 19:06.720
Oh, really?

19:06.720 --> 19:07.720
Yeah, I have to catch up.

19:07.720 --> 19:11.240
Well, it's a pretty interesting show, but the one thing that does seem to keep me coming

19:11.240 --> 19:15.800
back every single week is every single week they have gratuitous shots of the Linux desktop.

19:15.800 --> 19:16.800
That's beautiful.

19:16.800 --> 19:17.800
Yeah, it actually is.

19:17.800 --> 19:18.800
A Linux desktop.

19:18.800 --> 19:19.800
A Linux desktop.

19:19.800 --> 19:20.800
Yeah.

19:20.800 --> 19:21.800
Yeah.

19:21.800 --> 19:22.800
I mean...

19:22.800 --> 19:23.800
Not what they say it is.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.800
Oh, I see you're running GNOME.

19:24.800 --> 19:25.800
It's not GNOME.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.840
Well, sometimes they have run, they've shown GNOME, but it's mostly, it looks like KDE

19:28.840 --> 19:29.840
a lot of times.

19:29.840 --> 19:34.160
Like I was watching episode eight of season one last night and it looked like console

19:34.160 --> 19:39.080
came up and he was seeding the slash opt slash something or other.

19:39.080 --> 19:43.520
Do they have like a Linux advisor like big studios have science advisors for their films?

19:43.520 --> 19:44.520
It seems to have, yeah.

19:44.520 --> 19:45.520
They do actually.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.520
That's beautiful.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.520
Yeah.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.040
They have, it's impressive that they actually run commands and the stuff that it displays

19:50.040 --> 19:52.600
is really what it actually does.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.600
You guys...

19:53.600 --> 19:54.600
That's mind blowing.

19:54.600 --> 19:58.400
You guys heard us play this clip in last, a couple of weeks ago, but I'm going to play

19:58.400 --> 20:02.600
it again anyways, because it's like, when I heard this, when I heard this clip, I was

20:02.600 --> 20:04.400
like, okay, well now I have to watch that show.

20:04.400 --> 20:08.200
And I'd heard about the show and I was like, Christian Slater, okay, that's fine.

20:08.200 --> 20:11.400
I don't have anything really against him, but not totally drawing me in.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.360
And then when I saw this clip, I was like, okay, yeah, I'm going to watch this show.

20:14.360 --> 20:20.300
So I see a running gnome, you know, I'm actually on KDE myself.

20:20.300 --> 20:25.440
I know this desktop environment is supposed to be better, but you know what they say,

20:25.440 --> 20:27.880
old habits, they die hard.

20:27.880 --> 20:31.320
An executive running Linux, but I know what you're thinking.

20:31.320 --> 20:32.320
I'm an executive.

20:32.320 --> 20:36.320
I mean, why am I even running Linux?

20:36.320 --> 20:40.040
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.040
That's great though.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.040
Thanks Leo.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.040
That's such a great clip.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.160
When I saw that, I thought, wow, okay, I got to watch that show.

20:45.160 --> 20:48.120
So I don't know how we got on that topic, but if you're a Linux, well, you probably

20:48.120 --> 20:49.120
listen to this show.

20:49.120 --> 20:52.760
You're probably a Linux user and you want a television show to watch, Mr. Robot's a

20:52.760 --> 20:54.320
good one.

20:54.320 --> 20:58.120
I'm stocking up on a couple of episodes for the road trip, which I'm going to talk about

20:58.120 --> 21:02.160
a little bit on how I'm going to do some of my things offline while I'm on the road.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.640
I think it'll be an interesting challenge.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.120
Yeah, Xavier, you're welcome.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.120
Thanks for the new habit.

21:06.120 --> 21:09.120
Is anybody in the mumble room watching Mr. Robot?

21:09.120 --> 21:12.760
I watched a few of them, but I haven't kept up to date with it.

21:12.760 --> 21:16.040
I keep watching them in batches and every time I watch it, I'm glad I do, but I don't,

21:16.040 --> 21:18.680
I seem to let it go for a few weeks.

21:18.680 --> 21:19.680
How I do with them.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.680
It's good and it has like a little bit of things that kind of put you off for like a

21:21.680 --> 21:25.560
little bit, but then it pulls you back in with some of the tech stuff and you're like.

21:25.560 --> 21:26.560
It does.

21:26.560 --> 21:27.560
Yeah.

21:27.560 --> 21:28.560
It actually really does.

21:28.560 --> 21:33.240
Like I really, they say some of the people that are consulting with them are actually

21:33.240 --> 21:34.240
completely anonymous.

21:34.240 --> 21:37.920
Like they're, they're people they talk to over like Tor chat or something.

21:37.920 --> 21:38.920
Yeah.

21:38.920 --> 21:39.920
So there you go.

21:39.920 --> 21:40.920
All right.

21:40.920 --> 21:48.960
So I want to get into the topic of how I hope to enjoy some of the benefits of being online

21:48.960 --> 21:53.240
while offline in the trailer, because the realities of the trailer are I'm going to

21:53.240 --> 21:57.640
be really limited on connectivity because a I'm either going to be on, on cellular,

21:57.640 --> 22:01.480
which will probably be at best limited connectivity on I-90.

22:01.480 --> 22:02.920
And there's not, it's not exactly free.

22:02.920 --> 22:06.960
I mean, yes, Ting's giving to me for free, but I, you know, I don't want to abuse it.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.720
And then, and then if I don't have a Ting connection, then, then I'm really going to

22:09.720 --> 22:12.120
need to be self-sufficient.

22:12.120 --> 22:16.000
And so I'm trying to come up with a couple of different open source projects that I can

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
install.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.800
I'm envisioning, so if you're familiar with how RV trailers work, usually there's a spot

22:20.800 --> 22:24.480
where you eat and there's a table and there's two bench seats and those bench seats open

22:24.480 --> 22:29.000
up and underneath there, there's a perfect spot to set up like a NUC server and maybe

22:29.000 --> 22:34.520
like an external mirrored hard drive or something like that and put it underneath the, the seat,

22:34.520 --> 22:38.280
the bench and build a server there and then install some really nice, and I'm not doing

22:38.280 --> 22:41.960
this this trip, but I'm going to do some of these on a laptop just to sort of test it

22:41.960 --> 22:43.720
on the drive since I have the laptop.

22:43.720 --> 22:44.720
Version 1.0.

22:44.720 --> 22:45.720
Yeah.

22:45.720 --> 22:46.800
Version 1.0 is going to be on a laptop, like a beta.

22:46.800 --> 22:50.120
And I'm thinking what couple, what different open source projects could I glue together

22:50.120 --> 22:53.920
to essentially give me an online like experience while on the road?

22:53.920 --> 22:58.080
And there's a few major ones and that's also going to be a continuing topic in this week's

22:58.080 --> 22:59.400
episode of the Linux action show.

22:59.400 --> 23:03.160
We're going to double down and really, really focus on one really important one and show

23:03.160 --> 23:04.440
you how to set it up.

23:04.440 --> 23:08.760
But first, before we get to that, I want to mention DigitalOcean, which I'm considering

23:08.760 --> 23:12.320
how DigitalOcean could be sort of like an offsite cache for me.

23:12.320 --> 23:15.440
Maybe I have cron jobs on DigitalOcean that go retrieve things and in one spot I pull

23:15.440 --> 23:18.200
it down, maybe I'm on a Wi-Fi connection, something like that.

23:18.200 --> 23:21.600
So DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive

23:21.600 --> 23:23.600
and easy way for you to spin up your own cloud server.

23:23.600 --> 23:27.360
So if you want to get a Linux server set up, this could be a really great way for you to

23:27.360 --> 23:31.160
spin up something really fast and try it out for two months absolutely for free.

23:31.160 --> 23:34.800
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED and you get a $10 credit over DigitalOcean.

23:34.800 --> 23:40.360
You can get started in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans start at only $5 a month.

23:40.360 --> 23:46.920
And for $5 a month you get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte

23:46.920 --> 23:48.000
of transfer.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.880
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

23:51.880 --> 23:54.320
London and Germany.

23:54.320 --> 23:58.040
But what I really like about DigitalOcean, well what I really like about DigitalOcean

23:58.040 --> 24:01.200
is that it's all running on Linux, it's all using KVM for the virtualization and they

24:01.200 --> 24:03.600
use SSDs for all of their disk I.O.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.060
So that I really like about it.

24:05.060 --> 24:06.960
And they have tier one data connections.

24:06.960 --> 24:10.560
That's stuff I really like about DigitalOcean but the thing that really makes it all sing

24:10.560 --> 24:12.360
is the interface they set on top of it.

24:12.360 --> 24:18.080
It is a glorious interface that is really intuitive to easy and maybe simple.

24:18.080 --> 24:21.640
But I don't want to make it sound like it's not powerful because it is very powerful.

24:21.640 --> 24:23.680
You can do just about anything you'd want in there.

24:23.680 --> 24:27.760
And the nice thing is if you want to get really pro level, they've got a straightforward API.

24:27.760 --> 24:32.040
So go use that promo code DOUNPLUG, try out a five dollar droplet, two months for absolutely

24:32.040 --> 24:33.280
free.

24:33.280 --> 24:36.040
See what I'm talking about, DigitalOcean is cray and I have a feeling they're going to

24:36.040 --> 24:39.640
play a key role in my offline online world.

24:39.640 --> 24:44.080
Because the DigitalOcean droplet can always be online, while the trailer cannot.

24:44.080 --> 24:47.200
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUG and try them out.

24:47.200 --> 24:50.040
Trust me, you can find something, once you just try it for a little bit, it's obvious

24:50.040 --> 24:51.040
what you want.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.040
You will be hooked.

24:52.040 --> 24:53.040
You will be.

24:53.040 --> 24:54.040
That's right.

24:54.040 --> 24:56.160
DigitalOcean.com and a big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show and

24:56.160 --> 25:00.440
thanks to you guys for using promo code DOUNPLUGED.

25:00.440 --> 25:03.960
All right, so I want to talk about a couple of different projects that Wes and I were

25:03.960 --> 25:09.200
brainstorming that would help somebody live sort of an online life while offline.

25:09.200 --> 25:13.360
Because this is going to be a key thing for me and I thought this is probably a good mental

25:13.360 --> 25:15.520
exercise to go through anyways.

25:15.520 --> 25:19.160
And one of the things I really want to do while on the road is read.

25:19.160 --> 25:24.160
I want to be able to get my reading and catch up on articles and things like this.

25:24.160 --> 25:29.240
Word and Instapaper are kind of like the go-to for this and that's great if you can connect

25:29.240 --> 25:33.500
to your Instapaper queue or your Pocket queue and download them to your device.

25:33.500 --> 25:39.000
But nothing guarantees that when I decide to fire up the device, the app, on my phone

25:39.000 --> 25:42.600
for the first time in two days, nothing guarantees I'm actually going to have a connection.

25:42.600 --> 25:45.800
So I would really like something that would be sort of storing the articles for me in

25:45.800 --> 25:51.080
the trailer, getting them ready to read whenever I want to, when I'm on the local trailer network.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.640
And so that's where Wallabag comes in.

25:53.640 --> 25:58.160
Wallabag is essentially an open source Pocket competitor.

25:58.160 --> 26:02.140
The application is going to suck down the web page for you and store it offline for

26:02.140 --> 26:05.240
reading anytime you want.

26:05.240 --> 26:08.640
We're going to get to other ways you could do this, but this is a very Instapaper Pocket

26:08.640 --> 26:09.640
kind of way.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.800
And Wes, are you familiar with Wallabag?

26:11.800 --> 26:15.040
I've tried it out a little bit on one of their older versions.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.040
It seemed like a great idea.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.880
I don't know how the implementation has improved.

26:17.880 --> 26:18.880
Are you using Pocket right now?

26:18.880 --> 26:19.880
I have been using Pocket.

26:19.880 --> 26:20.880
So you get the idea.

26:20.880 --> 26:21.880
I sure do.

26:21.880 --> 26:27.720
And the same thing here, you can have a JavaScript bookmarklet that will send it to your queue.

26:27.720 --> 26:34.640
They have apps for Android where you can share to Wallabag, and it saves it to your local

26:34.640 --> 26:35.640
server.

26:35.640 --> 26:36.640
It's very handy.

26:36.640 --> 26:37.640
That's awesome.

26:37.640 --> 26:38.640
Yeah.

26:38.640 --> 26:39.640
So that's Wallabag.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.600
I don't know if anybody in the Mumba Room has an experience with it.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.600
You feel free to jump in.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.600
But this is on my try-to-do list.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.720
We've talked about it once before, but it's pretty cool.

26:47.720 --> 26:52.840
And then something else that I've got to really come to terms with is right now I'm a really

26:52.840 --> 26:54.320
big LastPass user.

26:54.320 --> 26:58.080
But if I'm offline for an extended period of time, it might be worth looking into KeePass

26:58.080 --> 27:01.960
and maybe specifically KeePass X, because you were saying maybe I might prefer this

27:01.960 --> 27:04.360
over standard KeePass.

27:04.360 --> 27:08.160
I like it a little more for native Linux implementation.

27:08.160 --> 27:12.080
If you track their Git, they have I think Beta 2 now.

27:12.080 --> 27:16.320
They're using the new KeePass 2.0 format that has a little better, you know, if you have

27:16.320 --> 27:18.960
multiple versions, you can intermingle them.

27:18.960 --> 27:20.880
They won't conflict anymore.

27:20.880 --> 27:21.880
So it's definitely worth a try.

27:21.880 --> 27:22.880
Yeah.

27:22.880 --> 27:23.880
I found it to be extremely stable.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.040
So no mono required seems really nice.

27:25.040 --> 27:26.040
Yes.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.040
And you see, it's in there.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.040
You are.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.040
Yep.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.040
So it's easy for me to get up and going.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.200
You can download the stable release, which works very well.

27:31.200 --> 27:32.200
I've had no problems with.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.120
And then the version 2 Beta, which is cool.

27:34.120 --> 27:37.560
Do you have any idea what the process is to move from LastPass to KeePass?

27:37.560 --> 27:38.560
I do not.

27:38.560 --> 27:39.560
I've actually never used LastPass.

27:39.560 --> 27:40.560
Oh, OK.

27:40.560 --> 27:43.340
KeePass has been meeting all of my needs.

27:43.340 --> 27:49.840
If your issue is to have access when you're not online, LastPass actually has a thing

27:49.840 --> 27:55.240
called Yosemite or something where you download your entire vault and it's locked down on your

27:55.240 --> 27:58.600
stuff so you can use it offline and you can use it like a portable app or you can use

27:58.600 --> 27:59.600
it.

27:59.600 --> 28:00.600
Oh, it's Open Sesame.

28:00.600 --> 28:01.600
So that's what it is.

28:01.600 --> 28:02.600
Open Sesame.

28:02.600 --> 28:03.600
OK.

28:03.600 --> 28:04.600
All right.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.600
I got it.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.600
Yosemite.

28:06.600 --> 28:07.600
I got to look into that.

28:07.600 --> 28:08.600
OK.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.600
Open Sesame for KeePass.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.600
All right.

28:10.600 --> 28:11.600
Now, that seems like that.

28:11.600 --> 28:12.600
So that might be a good solution for this trip.

28:12.600 --> 28:13.600
That's a good one.

28:13.600 --> 28:14.600
Yeah.

28:14.600 --> 28:15.600
I thought there was a way, too.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.240
Imacon in the chat room says, pretty sure you can export your LastPass vault to a format.

28:18.240 --> 28:19.240
KeePass can read.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.240
Oh, that's beautiful.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.240
Oh, and look at that.

28:21.240 --> 28:24.520
Odyssey says, here is your LastPass vault user manual for exporting.

28:24.520 --> 28:25.520
Cool.

28:25.520 --> 28:26.520
Thank you, guys.

28:26.520 --> 28:27.680
So that might be something I'll look into.

28:27.680 --> 28:29.880
Maybe not for this trip, but maybe for a future one.

28:29.880 --> 28:32.040
So Wes, you were trying to convince me.

28:32.040 --> 28:35.640
The other big thing that I want to be able to do, and I can't think of another way to

28:35.640 --> 28:41.840
do this, and I bet Wimpy is going to back you up on this, you know, right now I'm relying

28:41.840 --> 28:43.720
on Dropbox a lot for file sync.

28:43.720 --> 28:44.720
Yes.

28:44.720 --> 28:47.720
And I want to be able to continue to work across all of my machines, which is really

28:47.720 --> 28:50.960
going to be three computers in the trailer, maybe four.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.840
And I want to be able to update files in them and have them all be able to share the files

28:53.840 --> 28:56.880
so that way I can do show prep on the road, and then when I get a connection, have it

28:56.880 --> 28:58.440
sync back up.

28:58.440 --> 29:03.160
And I think you probably can't get around the fact that, I mean, to do that, I've got

29:03.160 --> 29:04.160
to use SyncThing.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.160
You've got to use SyncThing.

29:05.160 --> 29:09.760
I mean, there are some alternatives, but I think SyncThing works really well.

29:09.760 --> 29:14.000
It runs great just on a LAN, or if you have your occasional connectivity to your droplet,

29:14.000 --> 29:15.880
you can mirror things up there as you can.

29:15.880 --> 29:16.880
Yeah.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.880
I don't know, Wimpy.

29:17.880 --> 29:18.880
What do you think?

29:18.880 --> 29:22.480
Do you think this is the time to switch to SyncThing, or can Dropbox do the job?

29:22.480 --> 29:25.680
I think Dropbox can do the job.

29:25.680 --> 29:26.680
Without the cloud piece?

29:26.680 --> 29:27.680
Of course.

29:27.680 --> 29:30.080
Well, you only need one instance of Dropbox, don't you?

29:30.080 --> 29:32.520
You don't need all of your machines running Dropbox.

29:32.520 --> 29:39.480
You could have all of your machines running Dropbox and use LAN syncing, or you just export

29:39.480 --> 29:44.720
your Dropbox folder from one machine over NFS and mount that Dropbox instance on the

29:44.720 --> 29:45.720
other machines.

29:45.720 --> 29:46.720
That's true.

29:46.720 --> 29:47.720
That would be one way to do it, would be to have a...

29:47.720 --> 29:50.560
Because I do want to have access to all of the files on all the machines, because it

29:50.560 --> 29:54.760
could be notes sometimes and things like that, but if I had them all over NFS and then just

29:54.760 --> 29:57.800
had Dropbox running on the NFS server, that could be a way to do it.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.800
As long as you stay in the trailer.

29:59.800 --> 30:00.800
I don't know if you'll be...

30:00.800 --> 30:01.800
Oh, that's true.

30:01.800 --> 30:06.600
You know, if you go work in a coffee shop or you're eating Noah's, you can sync yourself.

30:06.600 --> 30:10.080
I often will be Wi-Fi hunting.

30:10.080 --> 30:11.480
That's a really big component of it.

30:11.480 --> 30:16.680
But if the Dropbox, you know, the local LAN sync works fine, then you'll...

30:16.680 --> 30:19.840
LAN sync seems to only work when it actually has connectivity to the cloud server to get

30:19.840 --> 30:22.000
the master index with Dropbox.

30:22.000 --> 30:27.400
No, it needs LAN sync to do the first initial upload, and then once the first initial upload

30:27.400 --> 30:30.920
of the files is done, the rest goes over the LAN.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.320
This is a challenging one.

30:32.320 --> 30:39.160
I'm not sure what to do here, because it's too big of a transition to make before Saturday.

30:39.160 --> 30:42.820
But the more I think about it, if I want four computers to be able to all work off the same

30:42.820 --> 30:48.000
files and be able to take one of those four to a coffee shop and still have all that work

30:48.000 --> 30:50.840
updated, that's got to probably be syncing.

30:50.840 --> 30:51.840
With maybe...

30:51.840 --> 30:52.840
What's the VPN client?

30:52.840 --> 30:53.840
Oh, Tink?

30:53.840 --> 30:55.560
Yeah, with Tink.

30:55.560 --> 30:58.480
So that way, when I'm at the coffee shop, I'm connected back to the...

30:58.480 --> 30:59.480
Well...

30:59.480 --> 31:00.960
And you can have the droplet with it, too?

31:00.960 --> 31:01.960
That would be how to do it.

31:01.960 --> 31:02.960
Yeah, the droplet, yeah.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.800
Yeah, the droplet could be in the Tink network, too.

31:04.800 --> 31:05.800
Oh, yeah.

31:05.800 --> 31:06.800
No problem.

31:06.800 --> 31:07.800
Oh, man.

31:07.800 --> 31:08.800
You don't...

31:08.800 --> 31:09.800
The Tink bit is optional, though.

31:09.800 --> 31:10.800
Yeah, it's totally optional.

31:10.800 --> 31:11.800
You don't need Tink.

31:11.800 --> 31:12.800
Yeah.

31:12.800 --> 31:13.800
I was thinking...

31:13.800 --> 31:14.800
Keep it simple, Chris.

31:14.800 --> 31:15.800
No, well, here, let me...

31:15.800 --> 31:19.800
I've listened to a couple of your, you know, ideas, and I fear that you're overcomplicating

31:19.800 --> 31:20.800
your connectivity requirements.

31:20.800 --> 31:21.800
That's true.

31:21.800 --> 31:22.800
I'll tell you what I was thinking.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.440
What I was thinking was it'd be nice if the trailer had Wi-Fi connectivity to have it

31:25.440 --> 31:27.040
be able to also be getting the files.

31:27.040 --> 31:30.840
Like, say, I'm working back here at the studio, and the trailer has Wi-Fi connectivity.

31:30.840 --> 31:34.120
It'd be nice if the changes here were already back at the trailer when I got there, if it

31:34.120 --> 31:36.520
has a persistent connection.

31:36.520 --> 31:39.040
And the only way I can really think to do that is to have the...

31:39.040 --> 31:43.520
To either have, like, the trailer, every time it connects, have, like, dynamic DNS, updated

31:43.520 --> 31:48.760
DNS record, or use Tink to just make sure it's always on the same network.

31:48.760 --> 31:49.760
I don't know.

31:49.760 --> 31:50.760
That's not...

31:50.760 --> 31:51.760
Again, that's not all, like...

31:51.760 --> 31:53.120
That's not all right in this first trip, anyways.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.120
That's all...

31:54.120 --> 31:55.120
And there's a lot of permutations that could work there.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.120
I just think it's gonna be...

31:56.120 --> 31:57.760
I think it's going on the project list, though.

31:57.760 --> 31:58.760
I think solving this...

31:58.760 --> 32:01.960
I don't know how I'm gonna solve it, but this particular problem is going on the...

32:01.960 --> 32:03.240
Is on that list.

32:03.240 --> 32:04.240
All right.

32:04.240 --> 32:05.240
GB Infrastructure Initiative.

32:05.240 --> 32:06.240
Right.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.440
The mobile studio needs a good Linux infrastructure.

32:08.440 --> 32:11.560
And then last but not least, this one is probably the one all of you were guessing in the chat

32:11.560 --> 32:12.560
room.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.840
I think I might just archive some websites with wget.

32:14.840 --> 32:16.420
And it turns out, like, the command...

32:16.420 --> 32:18.600
If we have the command in the show notes, it's crazy easy.

32:18.600 --> 32:21.480
There's an option in wget for website archive.

32:21.480 --> 32:27.040
So like, we were thinking maybe we'd use ARIA 2, or, you know, there's a lot of different

32:27.040 --> 32:28.600
methods to pull this particular problem off.

32:28.600 --> 32:31.160
I mean, you could even just send a Lava to Wallabag.

32:31.160 --> 32:34.640
But the nice thing about wget is it can just archive the single website.

32:34.640 --> 32:38.240
So we have the command there.

32:38.240 --> 32:40.000
And if you want to try it out, you can.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.120
I think I will beg you for some reading, like, just grab a few sites, pull it down, and then

32:43.120 --> 32:44.120
read them later.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.120
Yeah.

32:45.120 --> 32:47.160
You've got all your CSS images, everything.

32:47.160 --> 32:49.520
I could VPN to the trailer from Starbucks, Xavier.

32:49.520 --> 32:51.240
That's exactly what I was thinking.

32:51.240 --> 32:53.520
So Mamba Room, did you guys have any other...

32:53.520 --> 33:00.340
So any other suggestions of open source projects that kind of help replicate the online experience

33:00.340 --> 33:02.640
when you're offline with no connectivity?

33:02.640 --> 33:05.240
Chris has got a real bad internet addiction, and he needs help.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.640
This is exactly it.

33:06.640 --> 33:11.080
I need the slight sensation of being on the internet, even if it's just like a Nicorette

33:11.080 --> 33:12.080
gum.

33:12.080 --> 33:13.080
I need...

33:13.080 --> 33:14.080
I need something.

33:14.080 --> 33:15.080
Keep him going on his long journey.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.560
Because when I turn off the MiFi, right now...

33:18.560 --> 33:23.440
So here's what happens right now is I have a couple of different hotspot devices to

33:23.440 --> 33:26.720
connect to, depending on what signal is the strongest that morning.

33:26.720 --> 33:30.200
And then when I turn them on, all of a sudden I get a LAN, and all the devices connect,

33:30.200 --> 33:33.560
and all of a sudden they can all talk to each other and self-discover, and it's amazing.

33:33.560 --> 33:38.520
And then when I want to save bandwidth, I turn off the MiFi device, and my LAN collapses,

33:38.520 --> 33:41.560
and none of the devices have any IP addresses, and nothing can talk to itself.

33:41.560 --> 33:42.560
The Dark Ages.

33:42.560 --> 33:47.440
It's like they're all just individual monsters, just in the dark, bumping into each other.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.440
And then I decide, okay, I want to do something online.

33:49.440 --> 33:52.680
So I turn the MiFi device back on, and the LAN comes back online.

33:52.680 --> 33:55.920
And it feels so quiet.

33:55.920 --> 33:59.920
And it's been cool for about a week and a half or so, or whatever it's been, but today

33:59.920 --> 34:03.800
and last night I'm kind of like, okay, I would really like to have some solid connectivity.

34:03.800 --> 34:09.760
So I'm just curious what other projects you guys might suggest that I could use to kind

34:09.760 --> 34:10.760
of get that experience.

34:10.760 --> 34:15.460
If you wanted an offline search type thing, you could do local search with Yacy.

34:15.460 --> 34:16.460
That's true.

34:16.460 --> 34:17.460
Oh, yeah.

34:17.460 --> 34:18.460
That's a good one.

34:18.460 --> 34:19.460
That's not bad, actually.

34:19.460 --> 34:20.460
When I want to look something up but don't have connectivity...

34:20.460 --> 34:24.440
Now, will Yacy do archiving, because I'll have to be able to read the results offline.

34:24.440 --> 34:25.440
Yeah, it can.

34:25.440 --> 34:26.440
By default, it doesn't.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.320
It just indexes, but you can make it archive, too.

34:28.320 --> 34:30.280
Grab a TP link and get a USB mobile dongle.

34:30.280 --> 34:32.380
So Inagogo, you need to tell me more about that.

34:32.380 --> 34:37.560
If you would email Rover at JupiterBroadcasting.com, because I'm trying to figure out how the NUC...

34:37.560 --> 34:40.220
So the NUC is also going to be my firewall, I assume, and I need to know how that NUC

34:40.220 --> 34:44.560
is going to jump between different cellular connections for the LAN.

34:44.560 --> 34:50.120
Winby, do you have any input on Wi-Fi and things like that in an RV?

34:50.120 --> 34:51.120
Yeah.

34:51.120 --> 34:56.880
So I've got what we would call over here an SUV, which I think is more or less the same

34:56.880 --> 34:57.880
kind of thing.

34:57.880 --> 34:58.880
Okay.

34:58.880 --> 35:02.680
And I've got wireless and Ethernet in mine.

35:02.680 --> 35:12.720
And I used one of these travel routers, you know, so it's battery packed router and wireless

35:12.720 --> 35:19.500
end, and it's got a USB port on it that I plug a 3G, 4G USB dongle into.

35:19.500 --> 35:25.480
So that device, that router uses the 3G, 4G to get an internet connection and provides

35:25.480 --> 35:29.520
the LAN and it has one Ethernet port.

35:29.520 --> 35:33.500
So I can have one hardwired device, not that I ever use it.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.920
So I could plug that into the NUC, for example.

35:35.920 --> 35:36.920
For example.

35:36.920 --> 35:37.920
Yeah.

35:37.920 --> 35:46.080
And that way, when you don't want internet connectivity, but you do want the LAN, you

35:46.080 --> 35:54.200
simply unplug the USB dongle and you retain your LAN, but you've physically removed yourself

35:54.200 --> 35:55.200
from the internet.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.200
Yeah.

35:56.200 --> 35:57.200
Yeah.

35:57.200 --> 35:58.200
That's exactly what I want.

35:58.200 --> 36:01.680
And that's got that, you know, that's got caching DNS and all of that stuff on it and

36:01.680 --> 36:02.680
DHCP.

36:02.680 --> 36:03.680
Ooh.

36:03.680 --> 36:04.680
Okay.

36:04.680 --> 36:05.680
All right.

36:05.680 --> 36:06.680
Okay.

36:06.680 --> 36:07.680
Do you have a link to that one?

36:07.680 --> 36:10.600
I'll look it up and post it in the IRC in a second.

36:10.600 --> 36:11.600
Thank you.

36:11.600 --> 36:12.600
Yeah.

36:12.600 --> 36:13.960
Ever resourceful mumble room.

36:13.960 --> 36:16.680
You suggested MPD.

36:16.680 --> 36:17.680
That would be one option.

36:17.680 --> 36:21.680
And I was thinking, what was the, anybody remember the alternative to subsonic?

36:21.680 --> 36:22.680
What was that?

36:22.680 --> 36:24.840
Remember how there's a sub rage or something like that?

36:24.840 --> 36:28.560
There was a, there's an alternative subsonic that's come out recently that would also possibly

36:28.560 --> 36:29.560
it's kind of like replaced.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.280
That would basically be replacing Spotify.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.280
Yes.

36:32.280 --> 36:35.640
But other than that, that was kind of where I was starting to kind of, I mean, I have

36:35.640 --> 36:39.440
a couple ideas that I'm saving for last that are huge, but other than that, that's kind

36:39.440 --> 36:41.240
of what I've come up with.

36:41.240 --> 36:44.960
So if you go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com in the subreddit and look for episode one

36:44.960 --> 36:49.480
10 and give me your ideas for open source projects that give you that online experience

36:49.480 --> 36:50.480
while you're offline.

36:50.480 --> 36:53.760
And the thing I love about this is it's not, it's mad Sonic.

36:53.760 --> 36:54.760
Yeah.

36:54.760 --> 36:55.760
That's what it was.

36:55.760 --> 36:56.760
Thank you guys.

36:56.760 --> 36:57.760
Mad Sonic.

36:57.760 --> 36:58.760
I think I love about this idea.

36:58.760 --> 37:01.940
It's not just for those of us that are living on a metered cellular connections, but it's

37:01.940 --> 37:06.840
also great for just that whole bringing things offline again, moving things out of the cloud

37:06.840 --> 37:10.000
and bringing it back on your own land or your own droplet or what or whatever.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.720
Oh, Winby, did you find it?

37:11.720 --> 37:12.720
Very good.

37:12.720 --> 37:13.720
Yeah.

37:13.720 --> 37:14.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:14.720 --> 37:15.720
Zoomtel.com.

37:15.720 --> 37:18.720
Oh yeah, that's nice.

37:18.720 --> 37:19.720
I have the 4506AG.

37:19.720 --> 37:20.720
Okay.

37:20.720 --> 37:23.200
I'll put a link to that in the show notes for people that are looking for something

37:23.200 --> 37:24.200
similar out there.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.320
So that is perfect.

37:26.320 --> 37:31.020
So it runs off, I don't know if you have them in the US, but we have what used to be called

37:31.020 --> 37:33.920
cigarette lighters, but they're now just used to power stuff.

37:33.920 --> 37:34.920
Yeah.

37:34.920 --> 37:35.920
That's what I use in the trailer.

37:35.920 --> 37:36.920
Yeah.

37:36.920 --> 37:37.920
Nice.

37:37.920 --> 37:38.920
Yeah.

37:38.920 --> 37:41.440
And it also has a battery pack in it.

37:41.440 --> 37:42.720
That's perfect.

37:42.720 --> 37:47.740
So when it comes off the power, it's charged and it runs for a few hours off its own battery.

37:47.740 --> 37:50.480
So it's the travel one that you have?

37:50.480 --> 37:51.480
Yeah.

37:51.480 --> 37:56.320
I have the 4506AG, the travel router wireless end.

37:56.320 --> 38:01.780
You sold me with the DC power connector, to be honest with you, because I need everything

38:01.780 --> 38:02.780
to run off of DC.

38:02.780 --> 38:05.240
I don't even know if you can make a NUC run off of DC power, but if you can, I need it

38:05.240 --> 38:06.240
to.

38:06.240 --> 38:11.440
So, Staple sells them, perfect.

38:11.440 --> 38:19.600
But what you will need is a USB, a compatible USB dongle, and they've got a detailed list

38:19.600 --> 38:22.600
of what the compatible options are.

38:22.600 --> 38:28.040
And they have the, I bought mine on Amazon and it had the option to buy the car kit.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.040
The car kit.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.040
Yeah.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.920
I'm looking at it right now on Amazon.

38:32.920 --> 38:33.920
Very good.

38:33.920 --> 38:34.920
Yeah.

38:34.920 --> 38:35.920
Yeah.

38:35.920 --> 38:36.920
Let me see what I need.

38:36.920 --> 38:37.920
Jesus.

38:37.920 --> 38:38.920
What?

38:38.920 --> 38:39.920
How can it only be $30?

38:39.920 --> 38:40.920
Yeah.

38:40.920 --> 38:41.920
It's as cheap as.

38:41.920 --> 38:42.920
Yeah.

38:42.920 --> 38:43.920
Holy crap.

38:43.920 --> 38:44.920
Holy crap.

38:44.920 --> 38:45.920
That's great.

38:45.920 --> 38:46.920
Yeah.

38:46.920 --> 38:53.160
I think I'm going to put this on the list for something to look into after this trip.

38:53.160 --> 38:56.480
Now you don't have the ability to hook up to like an ethernet connection on the WAN

38:56.480 --> 38:58.020
side, do you?

38:58.020 --> 39:00.720
You can use WAN on the ethernet side.

39:00.720 --> 39:03.560
You can either use it as LAN or WAN.

39:03.560 --> 39:07.360
It's a selectable thing in the UOS.

39:07.360 --> 39:11.320
So when I have the trailer parked here at the studio, I could run ethernet out to the

39:11.320 --> 39:12.320
trailer network?

39:12.320 --> 39:13.320
Yeah.

39:13.320 --> 39:14.660
Oh my gosh.

39:14.660 --> 39:15.660
That is so exciting.

39:15.660 --> 39:17.320
I'm putting that on the list right now.

39:17.320 --> 39:18.680
Man, thank you.

39:18.680 --> 39:19.680
Perfect.

39:19.680 --> 39:20.680
That's exactly what I.

39:20.680 --> 39:21.680
You can plug right into Noah's network.

39:21.680 --> 39:22.680
Yeah.

39:22.680 --> 39:23.680
Exactly.

39:23.680 --> 39:24.680
Exactly.

39:24.680 --> 39:26.080
And then I'll have the NUC sitting behind that.

39:26.080 --> 39:29.720
So that way the LAN's IP address and DNS always stays the same or something.

39:29.720 --> 39:30.720
I mean, I don't know.

39:30.720 --> 39:31.720
That could be.

39:31.720 --> 39:32.720
Yeah.

39:32.720 --> 39:36.880
It does port address translation and UPnP and all that stuff.

39:36.880 --> 39:37.880
So yeah, there you go.

39:37.880 --> 39:41.640
So do you say you have the 4506A or what I'm looking?

39:41.640 --> 39:42.640
Yeah.

39:42.640 --> 39:43.640
4506AG.

39:43.640 --> 39:44.640
AG.

39:44.640 --> 39:45.640
Yeah.

39:45.640 --> 39:46.640
OK.

39:46.640 --> 39:47.640
AG.

39:47.640 --> 39:48.640
Well, geez.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.640
That's great, Wimpy.

39:49.640 --> 39:50.640
Good pick.

39:50.640 --> 39:51.640
So I'll have to make sure I put the right one on my list.

39:51.640 --> 39:52.640
All right.

39:52.640 --> 39:56.440
Anybody else have any other suggestions for replicating online experience?

39:56.440 --> 39:57.520
NUC does need DC input.

39:57.520 --> 40:00.360
So it might be possible to get the NUC to do that.

40:00.360 --> 40:01.360
Very cool.

40:01.360 --> 40:02.360
All right.

40:02.360 --> 40:03.600
Do you have any suggestions when you're listening?

40:03.600 --> 40:04.600
Oh, look at that.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.720
Well, look what Rekai just found.

40:06.720 --> 40:07.720
You can use any.

40:07.720 --> 40:09.640
Oh, that is so awesome.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.440
You do not need a DC to DC converter.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.440
Oh, my gosh.

40:12.440 --> 40:13.980
It's perfect.

40:13.980 --> 40:16.720
So it looks like other people have already had this same thought process.

40:16.720 --> 40:19.080
That's why it's the next unit of computing.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.080
That's right.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.080
That's right.

40:21.080 --> 40:22.080
Yes.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.080
Yes, yes, yes.

40:23.080 --> 40:24.080
That is so cool.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.080
That is so awesome.

40:25.080 --> 40:29.280
12 volts, 36 watts.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.520
That's amazing.

40:30.520 --> 40:36.080
That means I could run the NUC off of total battery power that's charged by solar panel.

40:36.080 --> 40:39.000
The homeland on the trailer would be run off of the solar panel.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.520
Okay, I'm just going to absorb that for a moment.

40:41.520 --> 40:42.920
I'm going to sit with that for a second.

40:42.920 --> 40:44.160
Now I think I'm going to tell you.

40:44.160 --> 40:45.160
Oh, go ahead, Wimpy.

40:45.160 --> 40:46.160
You had another one?

40:46.160 --> 40:49.440
The 4506?

40:49.440 --> 40:52.560
That's the list of compatible USB adapter.

40:52.560 --> 40:53.560
That's probably good to have, too.

40:53.560 --> 40:57.720
I will also add the link to that in the show notes so that way we all have that because

40:57.720 --> 41:01.200
I'll probably come back to this episode to look for it myself when I'm ready to make

41:01.200 --> 41:02.200
the purchase.

41:02.200 --> 41:03.200
So that's cool.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.200
All right.

41:04.200 --> 41:08.920
So now I have been looking at different ways to do backup for some of our production machines.

41:08.920 --> 41:12.400
And it's not just because I love rolling releases that I want to find a really good

41:12.400 --> 41:13.400
backup.

41:13.400 --> 41:16.120
That might be part of what's niggling at the back of my mind.

41:16.120 --> 41:24.280
So I have been looking at a kind of a slick way to do a real easy snapshot and restore

41:24.280 --> 41:29.840
system that doesn't take a whole bunch of storage space, doesn't require like a blank

41:29.840 --> 41:35.540
dedicated volume, and doesn't require a specialized file system that I'm not completely comfortable

41:35.540 --> 41:36.680
using yet.

41:36.680 --> 41:37.920
And so I'm going to tell you about that.

41:37.920 --> 41:41.680
But first I want to tell you about our friends over at Linux Academy because you can check

41:41.680 --> 41:44.400
them out and maybe take your skill sets up to the next level.

41:44.400 --> 41:46.960
They're sponsors of the Linux Unplugged program.

41:46.960 --> 41:49.960
I want you to go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

41:49.960 --> 41:53.880
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged gets you our special 33% discount.

41:53.880 --> 41:55.200
Now what does Linux Academy have?

41:55.200 --> 41:58.880
Well it's a training ground full of stuff based around Linux and open source.

41:58.880 --> 42:04.200
Self-paced courses, over 1,800 videos, they have scenario based labs so you get real hands

42:04.200 --> 42:05.720
on training with it.

42:05.720 --> 42:13.640
I think it was probably early 2004, 2005, I decided to go into community college to

42:13.640 --> 42:15.720
get training.

42:15.720 --> 42:18.800
Not nearly as efficient as this.

42:18.800 --> 42:24.480
Now like the concept of going in a few nights a week, how do people have time to do that?

42:24.480 --> 42:25.480
I don't know.

42:25.480 --> 42:26.680
I don't know how they do that to be honest with you.

42:26.680 --> 42:32.000
See Linux Academy, not only is it all self-paced and so you can just go at it with your own

42:32.000 --> 42:35.560
time availability, but if you really want to get specific about it, they have time availability

42:35.560 --> 42:36.560
selectors.

42:36.560 --> 42:38.600
So you can go in there and say okay on Monday I have this much time, Tuesday, Wednesday,

42:38.600 --> 42:42.120
Thursday, Friday I have this much time, Saturday I'm taking a break, Sunday I'm taking a break,

42:42.120 --> 42:43.120
right?

42:43.120 --> 42:44.120
Or whatever you want to do.

42:44.120 --> 42:45.120
Or maybe you want to do it only on the weekends.

42:45.120 --> 42:48.340
You tell Linux Academy how much time you have and they automatically generate courseware

42:48.340 --> 42:53.080
that matches your availability including reminders for exams, things like that.

42:53.080 --> 42:55.280
They have seven plus Linux distributions you get to choose from.

42:55.280 --> 42:58.360
They automatically adjust the course where they have them cool nuggets and they've just

42:58.360 --> 43:02.240
recently updated the nuggets too and I'm going to be honest with you guys, these might be

43:02.240 --> 43:04.280
some nuggets that are worth your time.

43:04.280 --> 43:08.320
So these nuggets are like two to 60 minutes, just a deep dive into a specific course.

43:08.320 --> 43:09.640
Aliases and escapes in Bash.

43:09.640 --> 43:11.940
You know you could be saving time with better aliases.

43:11.940 --> 43:13.880
The comma is your friend in Bash.

43:13.880 --> 43:15.720
Command history shortcuts in Bash.

43:15.720 --> 43:17.200
Those are all extremely useful nuggets.

43:17.200 --> 43:19.320
You just go in there right there and get it.

43:19.320 --> 43:24.040
Alternative command line for the email, privacy, web browsing with privacy badger, manipulating

43:24.040 --> 43:30.640
logs with sed, dig for DNS, user key loggers, Linux signals, a short tutorial, that's a

43:30.640 --> 43:31.640
great one.

43:31.640 --> 43:32.640
Check them out.

43:32.640 --> 43:36.200
You can go to linuxacademy.com slash nuggets but start by going to linuxacademy.com slash

43:36.200 --> 43:40.600
unplugged and also if you're interested in doing some training or writing some practice

43:40.600 --> 43:45.000
exams or maybe you want to do some backend work for Linux Academy, they're hiring.

43:45.000 --> 43:47.600
You can email them career at linuxacademy.com.

43:47.600 --> 43:53.080
So go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and if you want to get a gig, career at linuxacademy.com.

43:53.080 --> 43:56.760
Big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

43:56.760 --> 43:57.760
Okay.

43:57.760 --> 44:05.680
So Wes, it's called, I think, I'm going to say Datto block driver, D-A-T-T-O Datto.

44:05.680 --> 44:06.740
It's a Datto block driver.

44:06.740 --> 44:09.320
Now here's how they set it up.

44:09.320 --> 44:13.080
Now they recognize, and I like this, they build the case that Linux has some basic tools

44:13.080 --> 44:15.000
for creating snapshots of file systems.

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
Most use copy on write schemes to allow point in time consistent snapshots.

44:19.000 --> 44:25.120
Currently, both LVM and device mapper on which LVM is built support copy and write snapshotting.

44:25.120 --> 44:28.940
Unfortunately, both have limitations that render them unusable for supporting live server

44:28.940 --> 44:31.660
snapshotting across desperate Linux environments.

44:31.660 --> 44:35.780
For example, LVM snapshotting requires an unused volume in order to track your copy

44:35.780 --> 44:37.960
on write data.

44:37.960 --> 44:42.120
So enter the Datto block driver, Datto BD.

44:42.120 --> 44:43.800
It solves the above problems.

44:43.800 --> 44:49.720
It is an open source Linux kernel module for a point in time live snapshotting.

44:49.720 --> 44:54.060
Datto BD can be loaded onto a running Linux machine without reboot and used to create

44:54.060 --> 44:58.840
an image file representing any block device at the instant the snapshot was taken.

44:58.840 --> 45:03.900
After the first snapshot, Datto B tracks incremental changes to the block device and can therefore

45:03.900 --> 45:08.460
efficiently update existing backups by copying only the blocks that have changed.

45:08.460 --> 45:12.280
With a single command, Datto DB can almost instantly create a point in time snapshot

45:12.280 --> 45:15.160
device representing the snapshot state.

45:15.160 --> 45:19.200
Between snapshots, disk writes are tracked so incremental changes can be quickly and

45:19.200 --> 45:22.440
efficiently applied to an existing image file.

45:22.440 --> 45:27.560
Datto DB is designed to run on any Linux device from small test virtual machines to live production

45:27.560 --> 45:30.840
servers with minimal impact on IO or CPU performance.

45:30.840 --> 45:35.760
Since the driver works at the block layer, it supports the most common file systems including

45:35.760 --> 45:42.760
extended XFS and even ZFS and Butterfess.

45:42.760 --> 45:45.840
Although file systems with their own block device management such as ZFS and Butterfess

45:45.840 --> 45:48.520
cannot be supported.

45:48.520 --> 45:50.520
So Butterfess is not supported.

45:50.520 --> 45:54.960
Kind of a bummer but I guess not necessary since Butterfess has copy on write support

45:54.960 --> 45:55.960
in itself.

45:55.960 --> 46:00.080
All copy on write data is tracked in a file on the source block device itself eliminating

46:00.080 --> 46:06.320
the need to have a spare volume in order to store that snapshot.

46:06.320 --> 46:12.240
So in summary, Datto DB brings functionality of similar to like volume shadow copy on Windows

46:12.240 --> 46:16.960
to a broad range of Linux installs, file systems and kernels.

46:16.960 --> 46:19.000
Are you impressed at all Wes?

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
I'm very curious.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
You know they say efficiently.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.800
I'm interested in what the overhead might be.

46:23.800 --> 46:27.360
It'd be very fun to try this on some running systems and see what happens.

46:27.360 --> 46:30.000
All right so let's put it to the mumble room.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.360
Is anybody in the mumble room?

46:31.360 --> 46:35.480
Now remember Chris is going to be on the road next week and it would be great if we all

46:35.480 --> 46:39.720
met back here for 1.11 with a real good like story.

46:39.720 --> 46:42.120
Is anybody in the mumble room willing to try this out?

46:42.120 --> 46:47.440
You can do it on a virtual machine or an actual machine this week and report back next week

46:47.440 --> 46:48.440
on how it went.

46:48.440 --> 46:49.440
Anybody?

46:49.440 --> 46:50.440
Yeah, I'll give it a go.

46:50.440 --> 46:51.440
Oh I love it.

46:51.440 --> 46:52.440
That was easy.

46:52.440 --> 46:53.440
Yeah.

46:53.440 --> 46:57.640
So I'll have it linked in the show notes.

46:57.640 --> 47:02.720
I'm just really curious you know if it really can easily I don't know like maybe the test

47:02.720 --> 47:06.800
would be update a system and see if it's easy to go back or recover date exactly how it

47:06.800 --> 47:07.800
works.

47:07.800 --> 47:08.800
Could be kind of neat.

47:08.800 --> 47:12.160
Yeah but I've got a machine here that I'm using as my main workstation which I'm about

47:12.160 --> 47:17.480
to upgrade so I don't really mind if it goes horribly wrong so I think what I'll do is

47:17.480 --> 47:24.480
do some backups, do some updates and do some backups and roll back and then I'll do a full

47:24.480 --> 47:27.640
distribution upgrade and try and roll back and see what happens.

47:27.640 --> 47:28.640
Oh I can't wait.

47:28.640 --> 47:29.640
I'm really excited.

47:29.640 --> 47:31.000
This is exciting, yeah.

47:31.000 --> 47:36.480
So Datto block driver, D-A-T-T-O, Datto, oh very neat.

47:36.480 --> 47:41.560
They got me when they said that it makes it super fast to do incremental updates because

47:41.560 --> 47:44.320
that made me think that you know once you get the first one done then it's not really

47:44.320 --> 47:48.000
that much of a tax to fire off a quick homo free to an update or something like that.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.480
And I love the idea that you could just plug it you know add this to a running system.

47:51.480 --> 47:52.480
Yes.

47:52.480 --> 47:56.400
I didn't use a copy on write file system but I'd really love to be able to you know especially

47:56.400 --> 47:57.400
if you're running a rolling release.

47:57.400 --> 48:00.680
And especially if you know you don't really you know you have a system where extended

48:00.680 --> 48:04.840
four is just fine for you, something like that and speaking of extended four did you

48:04.840 --> 48:09.080
guys see that the next kernel update is going to drop extended three support or at least

48:09.080 --> 48:10.080
the explicit driver?

48:10.080 --> 48:11.080
Okay.

48:11.080 --> 48:12.080
Oh is that what it is?

48:12.080 --> 48:13.080
Not the support for it.

48:13.080 --> 48:14.080
Okay.

48:14.080 --> 48:16.920
So it'll still be there if somebody has extended three.

48:16.920 --> 48:17.920
Well it'll load it.

48:17.920 --> 48:18.920
Like a module type.

48:18.920 --> 48:19.920
Yeah exactly.

48:19.920 --> 48:22.760
Extended four now will be the extended three support.

48:22.760 --> 48:23.760
Right.

48:23.760 --> 48:24.760
Yeah because it can read it too.

48:24.760 --> 48:25.760
That's interesting.

48:25.760 --> 48:26.760
So it's not really a big deal at all.

48:26.760 --> 48:27.760
Not really at all.

48:27.760 --> 48:28.760
It's an interesting discussion though.

48:28.760 --> 48:30.760
Even if you didn't have it like who cares?

48:30.760 --> 48:35.920
It is an interesting discussion and if you look at the mailing list yeah and how they

48:35.920 --> 48:40.240
kind of go through and decide like you know the thought process behind it, what's it going

48:40.240 --> 48:43.800
to break, do we really want to run this risk and okay well if we have the backwards compatibility

48:43.800 --> 48:46.020
here and we can module it.

48:46.020 --> 48:49.000
So Corky says that Linus blocked it.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
He did.

48:50.000 --> 48:53.760
It looked like at least on the mailing list that then there was further discussion in

48:53.760 --> 48:58.800
the file system development that they are willing to say that the ext4 does not enforce

48:58.800 --> 49:03.920
new features so that you could if you had an ext3 then you use the ext4 driver and wanted

49:03.920 --> 49:08.400
to go back to a kernel just using the ext3 driver it would still work and they were willing

49:08.400 --> 49:09.400
to support that.

49:09.400 --> 49:10.400
That's my understanding.

49:10.400 --> 49:13.760
And I think I read that today or yesterday so it's pretty recent Corky if you maybe missed

49:13.760 --> 49:14.760
it.

49:14.760 --> 49:17.120
But it doesn't really affect anybody that's running ext3.

49:17.120 --> 49:20.480
The other thing that was interesting is that it points out that they're keeping or probably

49:20.480 --> 49:24.740
keeping ext2 just because it's a really good example file system so maybe anyone interested

49:24.740 --> 49:29.320
in Linux kernel development or file system development that's a good one to go study.

49:29.320 --> 49:30.320
It's simple but effective?

49:30.320 --> 49:31.320
Yeah.

49:31.320 --> 49:32.320
Huh.

49:32.320 --> 49:33.320
That is interesting.

49:33.320 --> 49:35.640
And if you wanted to implement a new file system there's a skeleton you can use.

49:35.640 --> 49:36.640
Start with something I suppose.

49:36.640 --> 49:37.640
Yeah.

49:37.640 --> 49:40.360
I mean it has it's pretty it's pretty road proven as I say because I'm thinking about

49:40.360 --> 49:41.480
road trips you know.

49:41.480 --> 49:42.480
It's very important.

49:42.480 --> 49:43.480
Yeah.

49:43.480 --> 49:48.080
So that brings us well at least towards the end of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

49:48.080 --> 49:50.720
I'm really I'm really actually pretty happy.

49:50.720 --> 49:57.080
We had a really good turnout for what is sort of universally known in like the news business

49:57.080 --> 50:04.560
as the slowest weeks of like this starting you know a couple of weeks ago till now is

50:04.560 --> 50:09.600
like in the US like our Congress goes on vacation like the news people go on vacation Anderson

50:09.600 --> 50:11.120
Cooper goes on vacation.

50:11.120 --> 50:13.520
Yes even Anderson Cooper goes on vacation.

50:13.520 --> 50:15.920
Oh my gosh it's Anderson Cooper everybody.

50:15.920 --> 50:19.160
Megyn Kelly goes on vacation but not the mumble room.

50:19.160 --> 50:22.520
The mumble room still showed up and I was a troopers.

50:22.520 --> 50:23.520
You guys really are.

50:23.520 --> 50:24.520
I hope you will show up next week.

50:24.520 --> 50:28.840
I have no idea what my connection is going to be like but it'll be fun guys.

50:28.840 --> 50:29.840
Yeah I'll also be remote.

50:29.840 --> 50:34.400
I'll be remote with you but if all goes as planned my audio is going to be recorded locally

50:34.400 --> 50:37.920
ham radio will be slapping it all together delivering to Rekai for video production and

50:37.920 --> 50:40.480
hopefully it'll still sound pretty good even though I'm on the road.

50:40.480 --> 50:41.480
That's the goal.

50:41.480 --> 50:44.560
The live show you'll hear me on the remote connection but in the downloaded version I

50:44.560 --> 50:45.880
should sound pretty good.

50:45.880 --> 50:46.880
That is the intention at least.

50:46.880 --> 50:47.880
We'll see how that goes.

50:47.880 --> 50:49.920
You'll find out episode 100 and 11.

50:49.920 --> 50:52.640
Join us on Sunday's episode of the Linux action show.

50:52.640 --> 50:57.000
I'm going to take this topic of enjoying online life while you're offline and I'm going to

50:57.000 --> 51:00.160
zoom into an open source project that needs way more attention.

51:00.160 --> 51:05.040
Wes turned me on to it a few weeks ago and I think a lot of people are going to be talking

51:05.040 --> 51:06.040
about it after we talk about it.

51:06.040 --> 51:10.120
I think there's already some people in the IRC I've seen using it.

51:10.120 --> 51:14.640
Don't spoil it dude but I'm really excited and Noah and I have been using it for a little

51:14.640 --> 51:18.080
bit so that way we can give you our impressions on it after a couple of weeks of marinating.

51:18.080 --> 51:20.000
So it fits in so perfect with our topic today.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.040
So if this at all it was an interest to you and you want to deep dive into something check

51:23.040 --> 51:24.520
out Sunday's episode.

51:24.520 --> 51:27.280
Actually I keep saying Sunday but I think we're recording on Friday that way we can

51:27.280 --> 51:28.800
record while I'm still in town.

51:28.800 --> 51:33.760
So we'll be live on Friday for the Linux action show for release on Sunday for download.

51:33.760 --> 51:36.720
All right well that right there will bring us to the end of this week's episode of Linux

51:36.720 --> 51:37.720
Unplugged.

51:37.720 --> 51:39.440
We should be live next week at our regular time.

51:39.440 --> 51:45.040
Go over to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone.

51:45.040 --> 51:48.920
If you want to suggest an offline open source project linuxactionshow.reddit.com look for

51:48.920 --> 51:55.920
the 110 feedback thread or you can email us at jupitabroadcasting.com slash contact.

51:55.920 --> 51:57.760
I got a magical drop down right there.

51:57.760 --> 51:58.760
It's incredible.

51:58.760 --> 51:59.760
It's great.

51:59.760 --> 52:03.840
Also don't forget jupitabroadcasting.com slash rover to follow the road trip as it's live

52:03.840 --> 52:08.800
and rover at jupitabroadcasting.com to email anything about the road trip.

52:08.800 --> 52:11.120
All right Wes well I will talk to you from afar next week.

52:11.120 --> 52:12.120
Oh this will be fun.

52:12.120 --> 52:13.120
All right everybody.

52:13.120 --> 52:15.720
Well thanks for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged and we'll see you right

52:15.720 --> 52:44.560
back here next week.

52:45.720 --> 52:57.800
Well look at that.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.840
Wimpy says he knows one of the guys that works at Datto.

52:59.840 --> 53:00.840
Really Wimpy?

53:00.840 --> 53:01.840
That's interesting.

53:01.840 --> 53:02.840
Tell me more about that.

53:02.840 --> 53:06.680
Well I didn't realize until I started looking through the github.

53:06.680 --> 53:13.900
His name's Dan Fury and he did some work in Arch a little while ago and I took on some

53:13.900 --> 53:17.320
packages that he'd been maintaining in the AUR.

53:17.320 --> 53:23.280
He'd been doing some work on Compiz and I just thought hang on a minute that username

53:23.280 --> 53:24.280
looks familiar.

53:24.280 --> 53:25.280
That's great.

53:25.280 --> 53:34.360
He's the guy pushing the source and in the same github account they've got a PDF which

53:34.360 --> 53:38.600
goes into some detail about how this all works.

53:38.600 --> 53:39.600
Very cool.

53:39.600 --> 53:41.280
Nice spot.

53:41.280 --> 53:45.600
It's the basis of a commercial product, dattobackup.com.

53:45.600 --> 53:46.600
Interesting.

53:46.600 --> 53:53.600
So although the code has only landed in github about a month ago this appears to be battle

53:53.600 --> 53:54.600
tested.

53:54.600 --> 53:55.600
It's proven in production.

53:55.600 --> 53:56.600
I heard about it.

53:56.600 --> 53:57.600
I was emailed in.

53:57.600 --> 54:02.000
Somebody said I've been using this for a little bit and I thought okay well that's interesting.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.000
Let's take a look at it.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.320
Datto.com is products built around this solution.

54:09.320 --> 54:10.320
Fascinating.

54:10.320 --> 54:12.160
Look at that.

54:12.160 --> 54:15.360
So yeah that's nice that it has a commercial back and it's battle tested.

54:15.360 --> 54:18.760
JBtitles.com also last chance to vote on the roadshow name.

54:18.760 --> 54:23.240
Right now Last Cribs Roadshow is currently winning with 42% of the votes.

54:23.240 --> 54:26.180
Finding Linux coming up number two.

54:26.180 --> 54:28.560
On titles we have Linux Unhitched and Last Cribs Trip.

54:28.560 --> 54:29.760
I don't know.

54:29.760 --> 54:32.220
Keeping Linux online.

54:32.220 --> 54:33.220
Going offline.

54:33.220 --> 54:35.720
No place like slash home.

54:35.720 --> 54:36.720
Classic.

54:36.720 --> 54:38.000
No place like slash home.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.000
That's true.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.640
That's not bad.

54:40.640 --> 54:43.920
Feel like we could do something more around the going offline thing.

54:43.920 --> 54:46.280
Yes.

54:46.280 --> 54:47.280
So what do you think?

54:47.280 --> 54:48.480
JBtitles.com.

54:48.480 --> 54:49.720
Last chance to vote.

54:49.720 --> 54:50.720
Anything grabbing you there Wes?

54:50.720 --> 54:52.440
Do you like any of those in particular?

54:52.440 --> 54:54.480
Well let me take a look.

54:54.480 --> 54:55.640
Yeah take a look.

54:55.640 --> 54:56.640
So that's...

54:56.640 --> 54:57.640
Is that Datto?

54:57.640 --> 54:58.640
That was a big NAS they had there?

54:58.640 --> 54:59.640
That's interesting.

54:59.640 --> 55:02.240
I wonder if they sell it to NAS creators.

55:02.240 --> 55:03.240
Yeah.

55:03.240 --> 55:10.360
They've got some cloud to cloud solutions as well.

55:10.360 --> 55:14.320
No place like Tilda.

55:14.320 --> 55:15.320
Keeping Linux online.

55:15.320 --> 55:21.240
I don't know I feel like something offline.

55:21.240 --> 55:22.340
How to download the internet.

55:22.340 --> 55:23.840
That's almost there.

55:23.840 --> 55:25.640
Going offline almost sounds like the show's ending.

55:25.640 --> 55:28.080
I don't know if I like that idea.

55:28.080 --> 55:30.040
Yeah that's weird.

55:30.040 --> 55:31.040
Linux Unhitched is close.

55:31.040 --> 55:33.160
Yeah it's close but not quite it.

55:33.160 --> 55:36.000
Linux Hits the Road is not quite it because that feels like that could be next week's

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
episode.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
Linux Unplugged disconnects.

55:38.000 --> 55:40.920
That could be next week's episode title too though.

55:40.920 --> 55:41.920
Yeah.

55:41.920 --> 55:43.480
Ah this is close.

55:43.480 --> 55:47.600
How about live offline like you're online.

55:47.600 --> 55:50.120
Is that too long?

55:50.120 --> 55:55.240
Is that dumb?

55:55.240 --> 55:59.360
Linux Unplugged unplugs the internet.

55:59.360 --> 56:06.320
Linux Unplugged gets away.

56:06.320 --> 56:07.320
This should not be this hard.

56:07.320 --> 56:09.440
This should not be this hard.

56:09.440 --> 56:11.480
Alright so hold on real quick.

56:11.480 --> 56:12.480
Let's just focus in here.

56:12.480 --> 56:13.480
We can do this.

56:13.480 --> 56:14.480
We can do this you guys.

56:14.480 --> 56:15.480
We can do this.

56:15.480 --> 56:16.480
I have faith.

56:16.480 --> 56:19.120
And the value of this is negative.

56:19.120 --> 56:23.680
Alright well there's no place like slash homes not bad but that could break the internet

56:23.680 --> 56:24.680
too.

56:24.680 --> 56:27.840
Ah let's see.

56:27.840 --> 56:31.800
Offline Online Solutions Offline Action Show.

56:31.800 --> 56:35.440
Offline Online Solutions kind of funny.

56:35.440 --> 56:39.120
I kind of feel like Linux 11 oh that's a little weird never mind.

56:39.120 --> 56:42.360
I kind of feel like maybe there's no place like slash homes the way to go.

56:42.360 --> 56:43.360
Is that awful?

56:43.360 --> 56:45.480
Oh my gosh we've got to find something.

56:45.480 --> 56:46.480
We've got to find something.

56:46.480 --> 56:53.520
What about no place like 127.0.0.1?

56:53.520 --> 56:55.120
Yeah that's not bad either.

56:55.120 --> 57:03.680
Offline Online Solutions Offline Action Show Linux hits the road why is this so hard?

57:03.680 --> 57:08.240
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

57:08.240 --> 57:10.680
Dang it RMS you're just distracting me.

57:10.680 --> 57:14.120
I'm bringing down the economy.

57:14.120 --> 57:16.080
Icarus says off the grid that's pretty good.

57:16.080 --> 57:17.440
Linux off the grid what is it?

57:17.440 --> 57:18.440
What is it?

57:18.440 --> 57:22.600
He said off the grid in the RV but I just tweaked that and make it something like I

57:22.600 --> 57:26.200
don't know.

57:26.200 --> 57:28.960
Linux living offline.

57:28.960 --> 57:32.680
Return of the local host I like that Shadow 7.

57:32.680 --> 57:36.200
Return of the local host isn't bad.

57:36.200 --> 57:37.940
Off great Linux.

57:37.940 --> 57:44.080
So I think Linux living offline or what was the other one?

57:44.080 --> 57:45.080
Most recent one?

57:45.080 --> 57:46.080
Yeah the one you just said.

57:46.080 --> 57:47.080
Return of the local host.

57:47.080 --> 57:50.920
So I think that's the return of a local host or living Linux offline.

57:50.920 --> 57:52.880
Which one do you guys like better?

57:52.880 --> 57:57.000
Wouldn't it be better if return of the local host was used when you returned and were a

57:57.000 --> 57:59.640
local host?

57:59.640 --> 58:03.000
Okay if we can remember.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.840
Living Linux offline.

58:04.840 --> 58:05.840
Living Linux offline.

58:05.840 --> 58:06.840
Is that good?

58:06.840 --> 58:07.840
What do you think of that?

58:07.840 --> 58:08.840
You don't like it?

58:08.840 --> 58:09.840
It's okay.

58:09.840 --> 58:10.840
Okay.

58:10.840 --> 58:11.840
I'm not vetoing.

58:11.840 --> 58:13.640
Yeah but you're not jazzed up.

58:13.640 --> 58:14.640
Goes off the grid.

58:14.640 --> 58:15.640
Huh?

58:15.640 --> 58:16.640
Linux goes off the grid.

58:16.640 --> 58:17.640
Old man voice there.

58:17.640 --> 58:18.640
Huh?

58:18.640 --> 58:19.640
What'd you say?

58:19.640 --> 58:20.640
What'd you say?

58:20.640 --> 58:21.640
What was it?

58:21.640 --> 58:22.640
Come on.

58:22.640 --> 58:23.640
Come on.

58:23.640 --> 58:24.640
Come again.

58:24.640 --> 58:29.360
Uh gosh dang it you guys.

58:29.360 --> 58:30.900
Gosh dang it.

58:30.900 --> 58:31.900
Gosh dang it.

58:31.900 --> 58:32.900
This is too tough.

58:32.900 --> 58:33.900
All right here we go.

58:33.900 --> 58:34.900
This is it.

58:34.900 --> 58:35.900
This is it.

58:35.900 --> 58:36.900
This is it right here.

58:36.900 --> 58:37.900
No take backs.

58:37.900 --> 58:38.900
Okay.

58:38.900 --> 58:39.900
Okay.

58:39.900 --> 58:40.900
Okay.

58:40.900 --> 58:41.900
Okay.

58:41.900 --> 58:49.680
I kind of think return of the local host just because we probably won't remember to use

58:49.680 --> 58:50.680
it when I get back.

58:50.680 --> 58:51.680
Well probably.

58:51.680 --> 58:52.680
We are the worst so.

58:52.680 --> 58:53.680
There's a thing I could just say.

58:53.680 --> 58:57.120
I think I could remember.

58:57.120 --> 58:58.120
I don't know.

58:58.120 --> 59:01.880
I feel like I feel like if we if we hold on to it I think no I feel like we should use

59:01.880 --> 59:02.880
it.

59:02.880 --> 59:03.880
Google calendar.

59:03.880 --> 59:04.880
No it's not.

59:04.880 --> 59:05.880
It's not that much worth it.

59:05.880 --> 59:08.160
I think we are so we need a good title right now.

59:08.160 --> 59:09.360
I say we can come up with another.

59:09.360 --> 59:10.600
I have faith.

59:10.600 --> 59:11.600
Faith of the heart.

59:11.600 --> 59:15.800
I've got faith that we can make it up again.

59:15.800 --> 59:17.540
Surviving offline is a real goof.

59:17.540 --> 59:18.540
Is real good.

59:18.540 --> 59:19.540
Oh.

59:19.540 --> 59:20.540
That was real good.

59:20.540 --> 59:21.540
Okay.

59:21.540 --> 59:22.540
Amazing.

59:22.540 --> 59:23.880
The one little difference that makes.

59:23.880 --> 59:24.880
Thanks the anime.

59:24.880 --> 59:25.880
All right.

59:25.880 --> 59:26.880
Thanks you guys.

59:26.880 --> 59:49.880
We're done here.
