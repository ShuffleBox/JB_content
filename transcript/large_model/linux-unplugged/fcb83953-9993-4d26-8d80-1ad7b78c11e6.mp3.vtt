WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
Okay, I've been waiting since we hit the record button I wanted to ask both of you what your naming conventions are for your home

00:05.600 --> 00:08.760
Machines on your land and drew I want to start with you. I

00:09.240 --> 00:11.240
Named them after astronauts

00:11.360 --> 00:18.160
so the laptop that I'm using right now is Aldrin and then I've got you know Grissom is my phone and

00:19.000 --> 00:21.400
Lovell is my tower. That's clever

00:22.080 --> 00:24.760
That's pretty good and not too far off from mine

00:24.760 --> 00:30.140
If you want to switch it up, like say you've got some servers off somewhere. You can just choose a different mission

00:31.560 --> 00:33.800
That's pretty good. Okay, Wes, what about you?

00:34.480 --> 00:39.080
Star Trek ships, of course, and I always make sure to name my admin account

00:39.080 --> 00:43.880
Oh do mine feel kind of boring now in retrospect because I don't have a ton of machines on my land

00:43.880 --> 00:47.000
I named my machines after the moons of Jupiter of which there are many

00:47.840 --> 00:50.800
So the computer I'm talking to you on is just really simple

00:50.800 --> 00:55.800
I oh just I oh and so it's like one of my favorite host names to connect to because it's very short

01:06.920 --> 01:13.120
Hello friends and welcome in to get another fresh episode of your unplugged program. My name is Chris. My name is Wes

01:13.600 --> 01:16.760
Hello, Wes and hello drew. Hello. Hello

01:16.760 --> 01:22.400
Oh gentlemen, we have a fine show today. We solved a problem. They said would cost thousands of dollars

01:22.960 --> 01:27.540
This is one of those episodes where we'll often talk about the pros and cons of commercial platforms

01:27.880 --> 01:31.760
But this is one of those things that Linux does that the other OS is can't touch

01:32.440 --> 01:39.680
Wes and I have come up with a couple of clever ways to use a Raspberry Pi to bond multiple LTE connections

01:40.240 --> 01:45.600
into either a load balanced failover or we'll even talk about a way you can completely bond them and

01:45.600 --> 01:50.400
To sort of prove a point. I am broadcasting from the woods today

01:50.400 --> 01:55.960
So we'll talk about that plus we have community news and all of that to get into I want to say

01:55.960 --> 01:57.720
Thank you to a cloud guru

01:57.720 --> 02:02.720
This episode is brought to you by the all-new cloud grew the leader in learning for cloud Linux and other modern tech skills

02:02.960 --> 02:08.520
Hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs get certified get hired and get learning at a cloud guru

02:08.920 --> 02:13.440
Com and also made possible by our core contributors. Thank you to our members

02:13.440 --> 02:18.800
I'll give you an update on that a little bit in the show as well. But also time-appropriate greetings to the mumble room

02:25.000 --> 02:29.960
I was late on the draw there. So I wanted to get you get you guys in before we went too far

02:29.960 --> 02:34.880
I appreciate I appreciate you being good sports about it. Hello everybody good to talk to you

02:35.080 --> 02:41.840
Let's start off with some community news that I'm pretty elated to talk about and that is Lenovo has begun rolling out

02:41.840 --> 02:46.560
Their Fedora Linux laptops and Ubuntu ones are coming soon

02:46.560 --> 02:51.780
The first models are appearing with Fedora as an option. The first one being the ThinkPad x1 Carbon Gen 8

02:52.120 --> 02:58.480
Not only has it rolled out with Fedora, but it's right there front and center and it's also the best price and

02:59.480 --> 03:07.280
Best of all, it doesn't come with a whole bunch of bloat as to quote the Fedora team Lenovo respects our open-source principles

03:07.280 --> 03:13.240
The only software they will have is from the included repositories. No extra fluff now so far

03:13.240 --> 03:18.200
It looks like you'll have to be in the US to get one of these but fingers crossed that more markets come soon

03:18.200 --> 03:23.120
I love that. It's vanilla Fedora. I think that's really great gaming on Linux has a great write-up and

03:23.520 --> 03:29.280
Liam writes we also know from what's already been said to expect Fedora Linux to be rolled out to the ThinkPad p1 gen 2 and

03:29.580 --> 03:36.840
The ThinkPad p53. It seems like Ubuntu is not too far off either and will probably land on the ThinkPad x1 Carbon

03:36.840 --> 03:38.840
Gen 8 soon and then other systems as well

03:39.680 --> 03:41.680
Love this. This is pretty exciting

03:41.880 --> 03:46.460
This is like the moment, you know where we start to see real Linux adoption happen at the OEM level

03:46.880 --> 03:51.240
Neal it's available in other places outside the US you're saying so when I talked to

03:51.920 --> 03:56.560
Mark Pearson who's the Lenovo guy who's managing this relationship with Fedora?

03:57.240 --> 04:02.740
He it's it's a matter of getting all the web teams for each of the individual regions to update

04:02.740 --> 04:06.120
There's the websites to get them showing up

04:06.120 --> 04:10.040
It is available in the web portals for the United States and Canada today

04:10.640 --> 04:12.640
It is available through

04:13.120 --> 04:20.240
Telesales or basically if you call them it's available globally. It will show up in the web portals are in various regions

04:20.240 --> 04:24.280
I think over the course of the next couple of weeks or so, but don't hold me to that

04:24.280 --> 04:27.920
I don't know for sure. I don't work for Lenovo. Yeah, sure. No, no, very good

04:27.920 --> 04:31.840
Good to know it does remind me drew that there's been some background

04:31.840 --> 04:38.760
Projects getting in place to kind of make this a first-class experience. Yeah, I think it's worth mentioning that

04:39.560 --> 04:43.920
Lenovo were some fairly early adopters of the LVFS project, too

04:43.920 --> 04:51.360
So this has been a long time coming and they've been fairly good community members in my opinion

04:51.760 --> 04:57.200
Just in the fact that they did launch into that LVFS system so early in the process

04:57.200 --> 05:03.480
It's nice to see you know, like some formal support too because what so many of us have been using these as great Linux

05:03.480 --> 05:09.920
Laptops for years and seems like Lenovo's finally caught on that. Hey, yeah people love this stuff. Yeah, there is that aspect

05:09.920 --> 05:11.520
It's like yeah catch up guys. Come on

05:11.520 --> 05:18.080
but what do we think this means for the vendors that have shown up for Linux and been here for

05:18.200 --> 05:25.800
Maybe like a decade like system 76. Is this gonna hurt them? Do you think I don't know if hurt would be the right word

05:25.800 --> 05:29.760
I think it's good for the overall community that we have more choice

05:30.440 --> 05:32.440
but it does

05:33.320 --> 05:38.520
Maybe say a little something about the vendors who have been doing this for a long time

05:38.520 --> 05:46.040
Are they going to be sidelined now that you know Dell and Lenovo are both offering, you know, first-class Linux support. I

05:46.860 --> 05:54.800
Don't know. I'm hoping not because I'd like to see things like, you know, tuxedo and system 76 continue to thrive

05:54.800 --> 05:56.080
and

05:56.080 --> 06:02.440
I kind of doubt that that's really going to impact them too largely just because

06:02.920 --> 06:09.280
Well system 76 is still a big player in our community, you know, and I looked at these laptops

06:09.280 --> 06:12.480
There's like the advocate in me. That's like I need to put an order in

06:13.000 --> 06:17.120
my Linux laptop was supplied by a cloud guru and

06:18.200 --> 06:22.080
So I need you know, I'm like I would really like to have a Linux laptop

06:22.080 --> 06:24.880
I would very much like to have one but when I look at the lineup

06:25.320 --> 06:32.120
Even though I'm compelled to like support this initiative. I've always believed in voting with my wallet, you know right now

06:32.960 --> 06:38.400
Like these first three months of JB being indie or like the just most critical

06:38.400 --> 06:42.880
Like if I can survive these three months and then make it the next six months and then make it to the year mark like

06:43.040 --> 06:46.960
That's gonna be a real accomplishment. So I it's like I really I'm really in a hard spot

06:46.960 --> 06:50.560
I look at it and like it just doesn't quite do enough for me

06:50.560 --> 06:55.320
Now this isn't an ad. This is totally just my opinion, but I look at something like the oryx pro and I think

06:56.440 --> 07:02.160
That's a lot more meat on that bone. And if I'm only going to be able to spend my very limited funds once I

07:02.800 --> 07:06.760
Get a lot more for that dollar from something like the oryx pro

07:07.320 --> 07:12.640
Maybe it'd be maybe because for me like a GPU is kind of important if I only have you know one machine like that

07:13.160 --> 07:16.880
You're probably also going to get you know things like a better support experience. Yes

07:16.880 --> 07:21.200
Lenovo is now supporting Linux directly on these systems, but you know

07:21.200 --> 07:26.420
It's a big organization with supporting multiple different platforms and operating systems versus, you know

07:26.420 --> 07:31.120
A smaller shop like system 76 with where Linux is what they do and they're all passionate about it

07:31.160 --> 07:35.040
Well and Lenovo is pretty new to supporting Linux, too

07:35.320 --> 07:42.560
So, you know, what's the quality going to be I'm not saying it's bad. I'm just saying it's an unknown, right?

07:42.560 --> 07:44.080
They're gonna be figuring some of that out still

07:44.080 --> 07:50.320
Yeah, and I tend to agree with you here. I've been a longtime ThinkPad user, but especially lately

07:50.320 --> 07:57.240
It feels like you've been getting less bang for your buck with the Lenovo models than you would with say a smaller distributor

07:57.240 --> 08:02.600
I still think it's significant because it it is a brand legitimization

08:02.600 --> 08:06.760
It is an option that a lot of developers are going to be comfortable with and enterprises

08:06.760 --> 08:13.220
But there should be some knock-on upstream effects that might help the other OEMs as well right now the advantage of having a big

08:13.220 --> 08:17.900
OEM like Lenovo directly and properly supporting it

08:18.500 --> 08:20.500
Linux in a very direct way

08:20.900 --> 08:27.460
Across the globe is that they are directing all of their suppliers to also support Linux the right way

08:27.460 --> 08:29.740
That is driving them to move work upstream

08:30.180 --> 08:37.540
Contribute to the correct projects get their drivers in there make sure the hardware enablements there it shifts the prioritization

08:37.540 --> 08:43.620
For their suppliers to like, you know, I I still hold out a tiny flame of hope

08:43.620 --> 08:44.420
You know

08:44.420 --> 08:52.220
It's very small flame of hope that Nvidia could be convinced to make their open source drivers for Nvidia cards work a lot better and

08:52.700 --> 08:54.700
and my hope is that because

08:55.020 --> 08:59.220
Lenovo is such a big user of Nvidia cards on all of their professional lines and

08:59.460 --> 09:05.580
Two of the professional lines that are going to come with Fedora later on are going to have Nvidia cards in them that it might help

09:05.580 --> 09:11.900
You know drive this case towards we should better support Linux out of the gate rather than you know

09:11.900 --> 09:15.060
this crap situation that we're all stuck in right now and

09:15.780 --> 09:19.300
That's good for Lenovo. That's good for the Linux consumer

09:19.300 --> 09:22.700
But it's also good for all the smaller OEMs that just don't have

09:22.980 --> 09:29.820
The purchasing power and the might to get a part supplier to respect them and then to be frank

09:29.820 --> 09:31.860
I love a lot of what system 76 does

09:31.860 --> 09:39.540
But they just don't have that might that is required to force the supplier to do things the right way and Lenovo does

09:40.140 --> 09:45.540
And like I hoped, you know ten years ago when Dell was starting to do this project Sputnik that they would do the same thing

09:46.140 --> 09:48.540
It hasn't panned out to the degree that I'd hoped for

09:48.740 --> 09:53.040
It will be interesting to see if we see any messaging from Dell in response to this

09:53.500 --> 09:58.440
Poppy I feel like I want to go to you to get some historical thoughts on these think pads and these Lenovo's

09:58.440 --> 10:04.080
Officially launching these Linux lines and if we zoom out in in a few months, we'll have Ubuntu versions as well

10:04.080 --> 10:11.260
What do you think about all this? Well, obviously I love the idea that my preferred laptop vendor of choice you

10:12.280 --> 10:19.700
Yeah, I know right I'm making it easy for me to make that purchasing decision and later this year I get my

10:19.700 --> 10:28.140
Laptop refresh money from my employer and I get to choose which laptop I'm gonna spend my money on and obviously I'm gonna spend my money

10:28.140 --> 10:35.720
on a laptop from a vendor that supports Linux and so there's now choice I get a laptop refresh

10:36.340 --> 10:38.340
amount of money every three years and

10:38.660 --> 10:46.300
Every three years there are more places that I could spend those dollars. I'm delighted by this obviously that is an interesting

10:46.300 --> 10:51.780
Measuring stick, you know when you come up for air every three years to start shopping again

10:51.780 --> 10:57.940
And you could kind of take a poll on what's come since last time and you're right it it's more choice than ever. We're also seeing

10:59.060 --> 11:01.520
Distributions work closer with hardware providers, too

11:01.520 --> 11:06.540
So I think we're gonna see more stuff there. Yeah, when it does come time for me to get a dedicated Linux machine

11:06.540 --> 11:10.620
Thankfully, I have my Pinebook Pro right now, but honestly, it's I'm a performance maniac

11:10.620 --> 11:14.340
So when it does come time, I'm gonna have an even harder choice, which is a good thing

11:14.340 --> 11:16.580
I think that's code for you break systems. I

11:17.980 --> 11:19.980
Just am a demanding user

11:20.940 --> 11:24.120
Thankfully speaking of upstream knock-on effects

11:24.900 --> 11:30.180
performance on the Raspberry Pi 4 could be looking a lot better for those of you using SD storage a

11:30.460 --> 11:35.860
Manjaro developer has brought to light that only the single data rate mode is currently being used

11:36.300 --> 11:38.300
for micro SD cards and

11:38.300 --> 11:45.860
Em MC storage with the Raspberry Pi 4 a model B, but get this ready with a two line

11:46.180 --> 11:48.180
Yes, two line kernel patch

11:48.660 --> 11:54.660
The double data rate mode can be enabled yet Tobias Schramm sent out a kernel mailing list post

11:55.140 --> 12:01.460
Identifying that it looked like the controller in the board circuitry appear to support double data rate mode just fine

12:01.860 --> 12:06.620
He also checked on the signal integrity on the data lines for the micro SD card slot and so far

12:06.620 --> 12:11.140
It hasn't found any issues now so far no one from the project

12:11.140 --> 12:15.460
It's really responded to the patches yet, but it was just posted this weekend

12:15.460 --> 12:17.980
I think so we'll see but it is exciting

12:17.980 --> 12:22.260
you know not everyone has the time to set up some sort of external hard drive or you just want to you know a

12:22.380 --> 12:24.380
small form factor and

12:24.540 --> 12:29.100
SD card makes the most sense. Yeah this machine. We're using today for this little tester

12:29.100 --> 12:31.820
Roo that we're gonna tell you guys about we're running it off the SD

12:31.820 --> 12:35.900
I mean, it's not great, but when you when you just want to get a pie going it's it's pretty nice

12:35.900 --> 12:36.980
and

12:36.980 --> 12:41.900
If you're running Manjaro on your pie, I think they're gonna patch this on their version of it, so

12:42.460 --> 12:45.220
Those folks will get it take advantage of it. Yeah right away

12:45.220 --> 12:52.700
Yeah, you know Manjaro is making a very compelling argument for the ARM platform however for these devices that we're using I've stuck with

12:52.980 --> 12:58.440
2004 because I kind of use them for a little more like reliable like server type work

12:58.440 --> 13:00.700
I want the LTS 2004

13:00.700 --> 13:06.460
But I also want something that's built to be server grade and as much as I love arch and I've put it on our server

13:06.460 --> 13:08.020
In the in the studio

13:08.020 --> 13:12.740
I don't actually want to run arch on my raspberry pies that are right that are acting as network routers

13:12.820 --> 13:16.060
Turns out one arch server is more than enough yeah

13:16.060 --> 13:20.100
Yeah, really, but this is a great little thing to see and you know one of those little improvements by code

13:20.100 --> 13:23.260
Which I love updates that make your system faster, right?

13:23.260 --> 13:29.420
I mean like if hardware is just sitting there and suddenly with a little bit of tweaking you can make it better for everyone using it

13:29.420 --> 13:36.220
That's really exciting all right. Well. I have something pretty exciting. I am very excited to announce that

13:36.860 --> 13:42.060
We have one of our first sponsors since going independent has come on board the unplugged program

13:42.060 --> 13:45.900
and it's a company that I've wanted to work with for a

13:46.460 --> 13:53.660
Very long time and they were one of the first on my list when we started talking about going independent again

13:53.660 --> 13:57.780
And I am thrilled to say this URL for the first time

13:57.780 --> 14:04.420
Check out for a special offer for linux unplugged podcast listeners and new linode customers visit linode.com

Slash unplugged and receive $100 towards your new account. You know these new ads. We're doing they're gonna be tight efficient ads

14:13.300 --> 14:17.940
this is not representative of what the ad will typically be but I wanted to take a moment with this first one and

14:18.340 --> 14:25.220
Tell you personally that for me. This is a milestone in my career because I've I have followed Linode from afar for a very long time

14:25.740 --> 14:27.340
and

14:27.340 --> 14:29.780
When JB stopped doing all sponsorships

14:29.780 --> 14:36.100
I wanted a pretty clear separation of church and state and so about two years ago for all my personal projects

14:36.100 --> 14:42.100
I started spinning everything up on Linode because I thought you know nice and clear and separate all of the work stuffs on one all

14:42.100 --> 14:47.340
Of my personal stuffs on the other and I watched I watched them become an extremely competitive

14:48.420 --> 14:54.420
Company where they really have evolved their product over the last couple of years to the point where it is

14:54.420 --> 14:57.700
It is extremely sharp. It is extremely well put together

14:57.700 --> 15:01.940
And the best part is they have been deep in the community for a long time

15:02.100 --> 15:05.840
So they're one of those companies that is part of the Linux community

15:05.840 --> 15:10.380
I have gone to many events and I've seen them at those events talking to people

15:10.940 --> 15:16.140
So check out linode.com slash unplugged they have plans starting as low as five dollars a month

15:16.140 --> 15:20.660
They have dedicated CPU plans. They have GPU plans. They have block storage

15:20.660 --> 15:25.100
They have the one-click app marketplace that I love but something else that's really cool something

15:25.100 --> 15:29.900
I played around with a lot with setting up different WordPress and I was able to play with different styles of WordPress setups is

15:29.940 --> 15:34.140
They have these stack scripts that will deploy a stack for you and you can just audit the script

15:34.140 --> 15:36.700
You can see this is where it's installing Debian. This is where it's deploying this package

15:37.380 --> 15:45.060
Really easy to write your own as well native SSD storage 40 gigabit network connections industry leading processors

15:45.380 --> 15:48.940
they have data centers all over and

15:48.940 --> 15:53.620
They have job postings as well, which I want to mention for those of you

15:53.620 --> 15:59.020
They're looking for work right now linode.com slash careers. It's not related to the sponsorship

15:59.020 --> 16:03.380
I just think that's something you should know about if you want to get that $100 credit and you're a new customer at linode.com

16:03.860 --> 16:07.820
Slash unplugged go spin up a box on Linode's infrastructure

16:08.340 --> 16:12.840
It's really cool. And I am so happy to have Linode on it as a sponsor, but also

16:13.580 --> 16:16.300
To have them here just as we're going independent again

16:16.300 --> 16:21.820
So they're one of the first companies helping make that possible. They started in 2003

16:21.820 --> 16:28.360
So they've been around a long time just like Jupiter broadcasting. They support the Kubuntu folks and other members of the community

16:28.700 --> 16:30.780
I've wanted to work together with them for years

16:30.780 --> 16:34.740
And so when when this deal worked out, I had a real moment

16:34.740 --> 16:39.380
I had a moment where like okay this decision to go independent is gonna work like

16:39.380 --> 16:46.540
It's it's really thrilling and I would encourage you to support our sponsor because they're making what we do possible right now

16:46.540 --> 16:51.680
And I think this is a great fit linode.com slash unplugged get $100 off and a big

16:51.680 --> 16:57.300
Thank you for Linode for sponsoring the unplugged program. I just recently set up a wordpress instance

16:57.300 --> 17:03.180
I did it in seconds. I was I was seeing what I could do to just do a self completely self-contained self-hosted podcast platform

17:03.660 --> 17:06.620
It's awesome. We'll be telling you more about it linode.com slash

17:06.620 --> 17:11.060
Unplugged I just signed up. I just your code

17:11.060 --> 17:17.860
I just signed up for Linode because I actually needed a quick and easy VPS to sign up for and

17:18.500 --> 17:25.380
Having $100 thrown in was an absolute bonus for me because money is tight and I really appreciate that. So thank you

17:25.380 --> 17:29.060
I've just signed up. Yeah. Thank you to Linode to do it. I'm looking at doing the same

17:29.460 --> 17:33.700
They're really cool company and they're one of those that as a businessman

17:33.700 --> 17:38.700
I've wanted to work with for years, but then there was like another relationship that kind of made that impossible for a while

17:38.700 --> 17:43.920
And then we weren't doing ads. And so this is just a bit an opportunity that it's really exciting feels pretty great

17:43.920 --> 17:45.920
It feels like a great fit for the show also

17:46.660 --> 17:54.300
Want to say a huge thank you to our unplugged core contributors. We are already halfway to the goal of essentially the revenue of a

17:54.300 --> 18:01.780
Single sponsor. We're about 50% now. It's like 48% the way there which is incredible. That's an amazing first response of the founder

18:01.780 --> 18:09.600
Discounts went away super quick, but the membership is still available at unplugged core comm we have two feeds for you one feed

18:09.600 --> 18:13.840
That is the entire bootleg live stream lots more show lots more show than what makes it in

18:13.840 --> 18:20.120
Typically, the other version is an ad free feed with some there is some small ads in there that are contractually obligated

18:20.120 --> 18:27.200
but it's like just the main fully produced show ad free and you get that as an as a podcast feed in your podcast catcher you

18:27.200 --> 18:28.960
choose either one and

18:28.960 --> 18:30.960
it's a great way to support the show and

18:30.960 --> 18:34.880
Not only keep the ad load down, but let us be picky and choosy, too

18:34.880 --> 18:39.560
So that's an unplugged core comm and thank you everybody who has become a core contributor

18:40.080 --> 18:42.880
it has been a very emotional week for me and

18:43.440 --> 18:49.280
That's one of the reasons I'm out in the woods seriously is just so I can kind of process everything that's happened and that support

18:49.280 --> 18:54.000
You know, it helped me feel like I was gave me some confidence that I was doing the right thing here

18:54.000 --> 18:58.800
The audience got your back they do they do they do let's also mention something else

18:58.800 --> 19:01.760
We're working on and that is coming up next episode

19:01.760 --> 19:07.680
So we're we're doing a fedora 33 bug-a-thon to test fedora 33 on September 8th

19:07.680 --> 19:10.640
We're gonna do the show and then we're gonna just move over into testing

19:10.640 --> 19:14.160
I want some people to show up and throw some hardware at the butter FS install

19:14.720 --> 19:16.240
Let's try to find some issues

19:16.240 --> 19:20.480
And if we do let's work with each other to do informative helpful bug reports

19:20.480 --> 19:24.160
Our idea here is we're trying to line this up with a testing week with fedora

19:24.160 --> 19:28.800
So we're doing this while the project is in a mode to receive these and we're gonna try to do

19:29.600 --> 19:36.000
Well done bug reports that actually help them and hopefully we'll have some people advising us and guiding us on how to do that

19:36.000 --> 19:40.080
And we'll be on the live stream working with people and can help bounce things around in the mumble room

19:40.080 --> 19:43.680
I'd like to do some brainstorming in the uh, lup lug this sunday

19:44.240 --> 19:48.560
And if you haven't tried it yet, maybe it's good time to go get fedora 33 and start banging on it

19:48.560 --> 19:54.400
The test week is going on right now as we record and it wraps up on the 8th, which is the last day

19:54.400 --> 19:56.400
So and that's the that's when lup is

19:56.400 --> 20:01.520
So that's next week as we record this episode september 8th 2020 if you can make it to jblive.tv

20:01.520 --> 20:06.240
Join us for the live show and then stick around to do some bug smashing or show up when you can

20:06.240 --> 20:11.120
It'll be a live bug-a-thon. I don't expect this to be a tremendous success or anything like that

20:11.120 --> 20:15.840
But i'm trying to learn how we can do this best so we can make this something we do a little more on the regular

20:15.840 --> 20:18.880
For other projects and distributions try to do something

20:19.520 --> 20:26.020
That targets the project schedules that can kind of land when it's most beneficial. So we're not overwhelming them with low information

20:26.720 --> 20:30.480
Low value bug reports, but try to get it right and that's what this is about

20:30.480 --> 20:36.880
And we're kind of doing our first tests with this next week september 8th, and you know how we love fedora

20:37.120 --> 20:39.120
Yeah, we love to give those guys a you know

20:39.600 --> 20:44.400
A good community test because the butter fs switch is it's a it's it's a huge switch

20:44.400 --> 20:51.440
And it's a very public thing and if we can maybe help avoid some issue that comes up that causes people heartburn

20:51.920 --> 20:53.920
That's a win-win for everybody

20:53.920 --> 21:00.080
Okay, so that's uh, that's everything let's talk about the little trick that wes and I pulled off

21:00.560 --> 21:04.880
Using two separate internet connections with linux. We are using myfis

21:05.440 --> 21:12.080
But in theory you could combine this with say a home broadband connection and a backup cellular connection. That's

21:12.080 --> 21:15.280
Tethered to your phone even doesn't have to be a dedicated data device

21:15.280 --> 21:19.360
There's a lot of ways you can actually mix and match this to bring maybe

21:20.000 --> 21:25.920
Fairly reliable connectivity to an area that maybe is having an issue. I am utilizing it because

21:27.280 --> 21:29.280
Uh, well, let's see how to put this you're a hill person

21:29.760 --> 21:35.280
Yeah, I am out in the woods and I don't I don't have like a broadband internet connection. I don't have like

21:35.840 --> 21:40.640
Comcast comes doesn't come to my rv. That's not that's not a thing. I thought you were going to say

21:40.640 --> 21:44.000
That's not a thing. I thought you were just like dragging a fiber cable out the back

21:44.480 --> 21:48.480
Yeah, right, uh, or I have a big satellite pointed at elon's starlink array

21:49.280 --> 21:52.400
Maybe someday. Yeah, maybe actually but right now

21:53.040 --> 21:57.360
the most practical approach this is crazy, but the most practical approach is

21:57.920 --> 22:03.120
I track down old grandfathered truly unlimited data plans

22:03.760 --> 22:07.840
And I contract with them and I have an at&t. I have verizon

22:07.840 --> 22:12.560
I have others too. I have actually have ting back in the mix now, but I have I have several others but

22:13.520 --> 22:16.880
For this I wanted to see if I could take a benefit if there was any benefit

22:17.280 --> 22:23.040
From using both my at&t my fi and verizon my fi at the same time and use a raspberry pi

22:23.440 --> 22:29.200
To sort everything out in between and there's issues here that have to be accommodated for like, you know

22:29.360 --> 22:32.980
My fives are pieces of crap that often requires stupid interaction

22:32.980 --> 22:39.300
Uh, you know and those kinds of things but there overall the idea was these are two very expensive connections

22:39.380 --> 22:45.060
Can I leverage them at the same time instead of traditionally connecting to one using that and then speed testing it?

22:45.380 --> 22:49.940
Connect to the other one use that speed test it and then okay. Well i'll use this my fight today

22:50.180 --> 22:55.220
And then tomorrow i'll use that my fi instead let linux sort it out and just use them both

22:55.780 --> 23:00.580
Just use them both and there's there's a lot of ways to crack this between like vpn bonding

23:00.580 --> 23:08.520
Which would require uh, like a node on a on a linode somewhere or some kind of remote gateway that would combine your connections

23:08.580 --> 23:11.460
But that's not the direction we went for this so you could

23:11.780 --> 23:15.620
And some have even talked about doing with wire guard didn't we see that as well west? Yeah, you know

23:15.620 --> 23:20.340
There are a few ways to make this happen because well it's linux and and that's how these things work

23:20.640 --> 23:24.660
Especially with networking and I think this would work really well for a lot of places

23:24.740 --> 23:29.620
Especially if you weren't like chris and constantly roving around this large country

23:29.620 --> 23:32.660
Because you do need a vps at the end and you basically, you know

23:32.660 --> 23:35.780
You've got your two internet connections and then you you set up a tunnel

23:36.580 --> 23:41.460
To the vps over both internet connections and then you just use the regular kernel, you know

23:42.180 --> 23:47.620
Interface bonding support that exists just right in the kernel itself to bond those together on your local side

23:47.860 --> 23:49.860
And since they both end up at the same place

23:50.420 --> 23:56.260
It just works and then the vps acts as the final gateway to the internet now a big plus with this too is

23:56.260 --> 24:01.960
Is you only show up as one external ip address, right? You just show up as the ip address of that vps

24:02.500 --> 24:03.700
But it's a little more complicated

24:03.700 --> 24:06.820
You also have to have a vps in play which not everyone does

24:07.380 --> 24:12.100
And it might be tricky for you because where you are in the country might not correspond to where that vps is

24:12.500 --> 24:16.100
And you know if you the latency there dominates everything maybe that's not so great

24:16.420 --> 24:18.500
So before we talk about what we did instead

24:18.980 --> 24:23.940
To accomplish what west and I were able to pull off just using free linux and a raspberry pi

24:23.940 --> 24:31.160
There is a commercial product made by a company called peplink. And these are the products you'll usually find in buses trains

24:32.340 --> 24:36.420
Um boats and in this product is called the max transit duo

24:36.580 --> 24:42.340
And it combines two lde connections and it has external antenna connections and it's a little router

24:42.340 --> 24:45.540
It may even be running linux itself. It has a bit of a ui to manage all of this

24:45.540 --> 24:49.140
It makes a lot of what west and I did simple the catch is

24:50.020 --> 24:52.580
The product is like eleven hundred dollars

24:52.580 --> 24:59.860
Hundred dollars. Whoa. Yeah, and then the bonding service to bond the connection is about a thousand dollars a year

25:00.100 --> 25:03.240
Wait, what? Yes, that's a little more than a vps

25:03.940 --> 25:04.980
Yeah

25:04.980 --> 25:09.860
So when I looked at those prices, I said I bet we can figure out a way to do this for free with linux

25:10.260 --> 25:17.380
And sure enough so the approach that we went with is it's it's more I guess akin to load balancing

25:17.460 --> 25:20.900
Wouldn't you say it's like a policy routing solution? Yeah, you know, um

25:20.900 --> 25:23.940
If you're still using if config, well, that's just fine

25:24.020 --> 25:26.020
But you really should check out ip route 2

25:26.260 --> 25:32.260
And the ip command because it exposes a whole bunch of really neat kernel facilities that you might not otherwise be aware of

25:32.580 --> 25:37.300
And one of those is more advanced policy routing now normally when you're you know routing packets

25:37.460 --> 25:39.140
It's kind of all about the destination

25:39.140 --> 25:44.020
But in our case if we have two outbound gateways two isps that are connecting us to the internet

25:44.580 --> 25:50.020
Things can get rather confused if the connection comes in from one and then goes out on the other

25:50.020 --> 25:53.940
Yeah, tcp doesn't like that. No, no, right. I mean, I wouldn't like that

25:54.580 --> 25:57.380
But thanks to policy routing you can set things up

25:57.460 --> 26:04.980
So that never happens if it comes in on an interface it goes out the same interface and the kernel actually has built-in native support

26:05.300 --> 26:08.340
To have different weights and to load balance between those connections

26:08.500 --> 26:13.380
So you can just set up multiple routing tables one for each of your different isps

26:13.620 --> 26:18.580
then you set up some ip rules the command is ip rule and that sort of you know sets things up so that

26:18.580 --> 26:22.020
You don't run into those confusing problems of things going out the wrong interface

26:22.020 --> 26:24.740
Make sure if it comes in on one goes out that same one

26:25.540 --> 26:30.100
And then tell the kernel how you'd like to preference them either give them the same weight and it'll just split the traffic equally

26:30.260 --> 26:34.260
Or if you want to wait one more than the other because it's faster. Well, you can do that, too

26:34.820 --> 26:35.700
now

26:35.700 --> 26:39.700
This isn't perfect in a lot of ways right because for any one connection

26:39.780 --> 26:41.940
It's not going to use the bandwidth of both links

26:42.180 --> 26:48.020
But if you've got multiple users on your LAN say or you're just downloading for things from multiple sites at the same time

26:48.020 --> 26:53.700
Well there it will work. And so this is something that we played around with because here where i'm parked in the woods

26:54.400 --> 26:57.300
Amazingly, there's a tower not too far away and I get

26:58.320 --> 27:04.740
95 ish megabits on one connection and about 60 megabits on the other what yeah, it's great

27:04.820 --> 27:09.140
So we thought well, let's wait the 90 megabit connection a little heavier

27:09.540 --> 27:16.340
And then that'll be the primary connection and then the 60 megabit connection is the one that gets used when the other connection is busy

27:16.340 --> 27:23.700
and the next level kind of trick to this was to set up that little raspberry pi as a router for the LAN and then

27:23.780 --> 27:28.660
Just set the default route on my boxes on the LAN to point to the raspberry pi

27:29.060 --> 27:29.300
Yeah

27:29.300 --> 27:33.380
What's also nice about doing this yourself with linux is it makes it pretty easy if you wanted to say like

27:33.620 --> 27:35.220
Let's say you've got the kids at the rv

27:35.220 --> 27:40.100
Chris and you want them to use the slow connection because it doesn't really matter for you know, whatever video they're streaming

27:40.340 --> 27:44.740
Well, you can use the faster connection to actually get some work done. Well, you could set that up too

27:44.740 --> 27:50.500
Now drew tells me that there's something similar to this that the ubiquity products do. Yeah, so you can do

27:50.980 --> 27:54.980
pretty much all of this in their edge max line and

27:55.460 --> 27:59.780
It's running viata, which is essentially just like debian but

28:00.640 --> 28:06.100
Repurposed for routing. Oh cool. So you can buy like a little edge max router

28:06.340 --> 28:09.300
Some of them are only like 100 bucks. That's what I use at home

28:09.300 --> 28:16.500
And literally log into a shell install debian packages adjust the routing manually do all of that

28:16.900 --> 28:22.100
Within a little box that's designed for routing already has multiple ports, you know

28:22.100 --> 28:25.620
Whichever model you buy is going to determine which port how many ports you have

28:26.180 --> 28:31.300
Uh, it's really cool tech that is neat. Okay, I would definitely check that out

28:31.540 --> 28:36.580
Well, like all great things in linux, so all this stuff is like built in but there's also some projects

28:36.580 --> 28:43.940
Projects that sit in front of some of these tools like the one we were using west was if I recall net isp balance

28:44.020 --> 28:46.340
Right. Yeah, and so where things you know

28:46.340 --> 28:51.860
You might might want a little more support and I should also note that um some other linux firewall based projects

28:52.100 --> 28:57.060
Like open wrt or shore wall. They've got tools in place to kind of manage this for you, too

28:57.300 --> 29:01.320
We didn't want to go that route. We were kind of rolling it ourselves to play with the underlying technology

29:02.020 --> 29:03.300
But if you want to get fancier

29:03.300 --> 29:07.220
You want to make sure let's say that one of these mi-fi craps out and just totally drops off for a while

29:07.460 --> 29:12.500
Has to be power cycled and come back online. You want to make sure that those cases are handled in a robust way

29:12.580 --> 29:16.740
So there's a couple tools out there. Um, we'll have them all linked in the show notes, of course

29:16.980 --> 29:19.460
one of them was just an easy link status monitor that

29:20.100 --> 29:24.740
Did the hard work of sending pings out your various interfaces and then running external scripts?

29:25.300 --> 29:28.900
When something changed and that seemed super useful really nice to customize

29:28.900 --> 29:34.340
But I think for your case we wanted something that was a little more plug and play and just forget about

29:34.660 --> 29:42.100
That's where net isp balance came in which is basically just um a fancy pearl script that sets all of this ip based

29:42.660 --> 29:48.760
Policy routing up for you and has a few ip tables tricks up its sleeve too to make this automatic

29:49.140 --> 29:51.140
It's also got a nice failover mode

29:51.140 --> 29:54.020
So if you don't want to load balance, you just want to say have a backup connection

29:54.020 --> 29:59.540
Maybe that's maybe that's a mi-fi and you have a regular cable connection or something that works, too. Yeah

29:59.940 --> 30:02.260
That's the part where I could see it being really useful for

30:02.740 --> 30:07.060
Remote offices that are maybe have connectivity that have a broadband connection, but it's a little flaky

30:07.060 --> 30:10.020
I've definitely had clients that have been in that situation before or people at home

30:10.580 --> 30:12.740
That always want to be able to have some connectivity

30:12.740 --> 30:15.220
Maybe it's for their alarm system monitoring to their camera system

30:15.300 --> 30:20.260
You could have it fail over to something like a ting mi-fi that you're only paying for when you use the data

30:20.260 --> 30:26.740
Um, or what i'm doing here is google fi is like the third backup if for some reason I have no verizon and at&t

30:26.820 --> 30:30.980
It's unlikely that i'll have google fi but it'll give it a shot and that's pretty neat

30:31.380 --> 30:36.980
And you just have this really easy to set up config file and it makes it simple

30:37.060 --> 30:41.300
I assume you probably have to have mailing set up on your machine, but it makes it very simple to generate alerts

30:41.780 --> 30:44.340
When an event occurs as well, which is really nice

30:44.340 --> 30:48.500
So you don't have to sit there and watch it. It'll just send something to like an email inbox, right?

30:48.500 --> 30:51.940
You can get an email saying like hey, just so you know your main connection went down

30:52.180 --> 30:56.100
I'm now using your more expensive backup connection just to be aware

30:56.660 --> 30:58.660
Yeah, so that's net isp balance

30:58.980 --> 31:04.420
And it's it's one of the it's just one of those great open source tools because a lot of the heavy liftings actually being

31:04.820 --> 31:06.820
Done by the kernel and the os tools

31:07.060 --> 31:11.540
But like west said this this pearl script really kind of wraps it all up and makes it nice and approachable for you

31:11.860 --> 31:14.740
Yes, and it it'll handle some of that monitoring for you too, right?

31:14.740 --> 31:15.940
So it's going to be doing you know

31:15.940 --> 31:19.700
You can configure it with endpoints that you want to test it's going to send out periodic pings

31:19.780 --> 31:24.260
You can also configure it to say like oh well if packet loss exceeds a certain threshold well

31:24.260 --> 31:29.460
Then consider that link down all kinds of options like that and another sign that I really liked

31:29.540 --> 31:34.660
I mean as you said chris, it's just basically using a whole bunch of you know built-in stuff to the operating system

31:34.980 --> 31:36.420
It's got a debug mode

31:36.420 --> 31:41.380
so if you want to go investigate what commands it's running or just use it as a script to orchestrate this and then

31:41.700 --> 31:44.500
Customize it run those commands yourself. That's possible, too

31:44.500 --> 31:48.980
Mm-hmm. Yeah, good point. So, okay. Let's let's talk a little bit about

31:49.540 --> 31:52.980
Uh policy routing a bit more because that was kind of key to make this work

31:53.380 --> 31:57.460
Traditional ip routing systems just route packets by comparing the destination address

31:57.940 --> 32:02.020
Against a predefined list of routes that it can go to and at certain points as well

32:02.020 --> 32:06.180
I've got nowhere else to send this i'll send it to the default gateway and that's my understanding of routing

32:06.260 --> 32:10.500
So how does that differ from policy routing? Well policy routing is just more flexible

32:10.500 --> 32:16.180
It lets you it lets you use other information that's available. Maybe the source of the packet. Maybe the protocol that's going on

32:16.660 --> 32:23.220
basically a whole bunch of other options instead of just the destination and usually the way this works is you've got you've got basically this

32:23.780 --> 32:27.620
Set of rules that you can have and then you can add additional routing tables

32:28.020 --> 32:31.780
this might be familiar for folks who are used to you know, maybe more network grade routers that have a

32:32.420 --> 32:35.060
vrfs virtual routing and forwarding tables that exist

32:35.540 --> 32:39.780
And it just adds a lot of flexibility because originally you just have that one main routing table

32:39.780 --> 32:43.860
But actually under etsy ip route 2 slash rt underscore tables

32:44.340 --> 32:49.220
Just by adding a line in that file you can add to basically as many as you want

32:49.620 --> 32:53.380
And then once you've got these tables set up they act as little routing namespaces

32:53.460 --> 32:55.620
So you can configure default different default routes

32:55.620 --> 32:59.620
You can set up access and then you can set up some rules that make sure things

32:59.940 --> 33:04.740
Based on either the source or the protocol or whatever fields that you have access to through policy routing

33:05.300 --> 33:07.700
go to the right table and then those tables just have

33:07.700 --> 33:13.780
Routes that work as normal and then direct the traffic on so you can make sure that say like if you have different lands that

33:13.780 --> 33:16.980
You need to get to you can set it up. So those go the shortest hop possible

33:17.300 --> 33:22.820
And in our case, that's the magic that says oh look you came from this interface over here

33:23.220 --> 33:27.460
Let's make sure that you choose the routing table that sends you back out that same interface

33:28.340 --> 33:32.100
And in the past you could do this too. Um ip tables has a marking facility

33:32.180 --> 33:36.260
so you could use ip tables that would set a mark on a package if it came in over that interface and then I

33:36.260 --> 33:41.620
On the outside it would identify that mark and then know how to send it. But this is just a much cleaner approach

33:42.260 --> 33:49.060
Now from like the totally other end, uh, this is something we didn't play around with but we did come across speedify

33:49.380 --> 33:56.740
which is a commercial graphical user application that promises to combine multiple connections on your linux desktop or on

33:57.140 --> 34:02.660
I think other os's as well including maybe mobile and and it also include vpns in that potentially and it

34:02.660 --> 34:07.860
It combines all of the connections into one vpn back to their server. It's a commercial product. It's like three dollars a month

34:08.500 --> 34:12.660
Um, but they kind of promised to do this only you don't have to have a separate device

34:12.740 --> 34:13.940
It's acting as a default gateway

34:13.940 --> 34:17.460
You just like throw it on your laptop and you connect a couple devices up

34:17.540 --> 34:21.140
And then this this app gives you a gooey to bring them together didn't try it

34:21.140 --> 34:24.100
But it's certainly from the screenshots looks pretty decent

34:24.500 --> 34:28.920
So that's something if you're interested if you're interested in this but don't want to go through all that rigamarole

34:28.920 --> 34:34.440
You could give that a go but for me it was worth all of the rigamarole to get a linux box set up

34:34.520 --> 34:39.640
and and get all this done and and and figure out how to do all this because that's sort of like

34:39.960 --> 34:44.600
Um the groundwork for a good edge device that then I could say make a wire guard endpoint

34:45.000 --> 34:47.640
Or perhaps I could put a squid proxy on so that way i'm not

34:47.960 --> 34:52.440
sending as many web requests out over the myfis and instead i'm answering them locally from a cache and

34:52.840 --> 34:56.040
Setting it up as a local dns cache seems like a no-brainer as well

34:56.040 --> 35:01.880
And maybe it's an edge cache for steam possibly as well if I throw a usb hard disk on there all of a sudden

35:02.360 --> 35:05.740
This little raspberry pi that's managing these multiple connections

35:06.600 --> 35:09.880
Can start doing other things that are clever to take the load

35:10.520 --> 35:14.280
Off of my myfis and make the overall experience faster as well

35:14.520 --> 35:16.600
And so that's why I thought it was worth the effort, right?

35:16.680 --> 35:19.800
And you know, I think it's a good use case here too because you might ask

35:19.800 --> 35:26.680
Well, is the pi really up to something like this? But since you don't have a fancy, you know gigabit fiber connection the speeds on your

35:26.920 --> 35:29.880
On your outbound really aren't too bad. So it seems to be working nicely

35:30.040 --> 35:34.760
Yeah, I think it's a good point to make is if you were if you were maybe connecting to something considerably faster

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
You might want a faster machine as the router

35:37.400 --> 35:42.760
I also want to clarify here too that you know net isp balance was really neat to find also because

35:43.320 --> 35:47.080
While policy routing is not too complicated in the simple case that we were talking about and

35:47.080 --> 35:51.080
Um, we'll have linked in the show notes just the sort of the basic guide that we followed when we were setting it all

35:51.160 --> 35:56.360
Up by hand, but if you're new to networking or networking with linux and this all sounds a little bit over your head

35:56.680 --> 35:59.560
you don't really have to worry about that with net isp balance because

36:00.040 --> 36:03.640
Basically the bare minimums that you need are you got to have your multiple connections?

36:03.800 --> 36:06.460
They got to have ip addresses in our case. That was just dhcp

36:07.160 --> 36:10.120
To the myfis and then it literally took care of the rest

36:10.200 --> 36:12.680
I mean you did have to set up in the config file. You've got to tell it

36:12.680 --> 36:18.600
What type of service you got, you know, like which are your lan interfaces and which ones are isps and which device does that correspond?

36:18.600 --> 36:23.640
To then you can also that's where you can customize the weights and like what ip to ping to check if the connection is up

36:23.640 --> 36:30.520
But that was all we configured and it set up everything else. Yeah, and it's really simple because it refers to stuff as lan

36:30.840 --> 36:33.720
Isp one isp2 and so it's not confusing at all

36:33.720 --> 36:38.280
You know exactly what connections you're dealing with which I thought was really nice and it made it super simple to read

36:38.280 --> 36:42.920
I could see us doing other things down the road to accommodate the fact that these are crappy myfis

36:44.040 --> 36:45.320
like

36:45.320 --> 36:47.720
using tools like full sm to

36:48.280 --> 36:53.560
Monitor the links of them and then when it detects that some sort of link has failed triggering another script that does a usb

36:53.640 --> 36:58.840
port reset to reconnect the myfi I could I could see little workarounds needing to come up because

36:59.800 --> 37:05.560
Really for me ideally like the one thing that the peplink device has is the the sim card slots

37:05.560 --> 37:10.920
Are fully integrated into the actual device. They're not these usb myfi devices. They're running their own crappy oses

37:11.160 --> 37:17.160
That's probably the biggest limitation here is yeah, it's not like a real interface or anything or a fancy high-end sim interface

37:17.400 --> 37:20.760
It's just a chromey myfi. Yeah, another thing that came to my mind

37:20.760 --> 37:25.800
That would be a neat stretch goal here is uh, you know set something up to do speed tests across the various links

37:25.800 --> 37:29.400
And then shift the weights as those speed test results change. Yeah

37:30.040 --> 37:33.000
That would have been useful today because before we started recording

37:33.000 --> 37:39.320
I did all the tests and the at&t connection was far and above the connection to use for our remote voip setup here

37:39.880 --> 37:43.960
15 minutes before we went on air the at&t connection was unusable

37:43.960 --> 37:50.760
It was dropping packets to our voice server like crazy for some reason out of nowhere just every second or third packet gone

37:50.760 --> 37:52.760
Sometimes multiple packets in a row gone

37:53.080 --> 37:57.400
And the verizon connection out of the batch all of a sudden was the best connection

37:57.800 --> 38:01.720
And it got me thinking like boy it'd be really cool to have some sort of health check script

38:01.720 --> 38:05.640
That just does a sanity check back to the studio and then picks the connection

38:06.120 --> 38:10.440
That performed the best in that health check. Yeah, wouldn't that that would just be so slick

38:11.480 --> 38:16.120
So pro it'd be so pro. I tell you what, uh colonel points out that there is the uh,

38:16.600 --> 38:20.360
G il or g g g g i net devices like I have their little mini slate

38:20.600 --> 38:24.120
They do have one with dual sims and I saw that I was looking at that one actually

38:24.120 --> 38:29.000
So i'll probably eventually switch this up in the meantime. I kind of want to see how far we can take it

38:29.000 --> 38:33.240
So we're going to play with it a bit, but it was it was really fascinating to get

38:33.320 --> 38:39.640
I would say at least the core functionality of that thousand dollar device for totally free with linux, right?

38:39.640 --> 38:43.640
That was one of those things like windows can't really do this mac os can't really do this

38:43.640 --> 38:46.920
This is pretty awesome. Like the fact that the kernel is just totally

38:47.720 --> 38:51.720
Helping us out by keeping track of the routes and it's easy to bond these connections

38:51.720 --> 38:55.560
And then it's easy for an open source developer to create a pearl script that sits on top of all of this that

38:55.560 --> 39:01.640
I mean, it's it's pretty awesome stuff and like the policy routing is like you're saying it's like enterprise grade routing stuff

39:01.640 --> 39:07.160
So it's and I have it right here on a tiny little 40 pie. Yeah, that's what that's what's really exciting to me

39:07.160 --> 39:12.200
Is it's just like the kernel has a really rich networking stack and yeah, okay if you've got, you know

39:12.200 --> 39:16.600
Crazy high line rate speeds. Maybe it's not going to cut it for you. But for anything we're doing

39:17.160 --> 39:22.120
Totally more than enough. Yeah, so we'll have links to the projects and some of the other projects that we saw that could be useful

39:22.120 --> 39:29.160
Uh in the show notes if you're curious about maybe setting up a backup connection or combining two connections those resources

39:29.800 --> 39:31.800
Should be a good starting spot

39:33.640 --> 39:40.440
Well, mr. Payne, uh, what do you say we move to the feedback and uh, we have something submitted by jay that we may adopt

39:40.440 --> 39:42.440
We may fork this ourselves

39:42.440 --> 39:48.120
This is a getting started with the jupiter broadcasting matrix guide a quick start including

39:48.120 --> 39:54.280
A video walkthrough to make it super easy, but also just a step-by-step guide for getting on the jupiter broadcasting matrix

39:55.240 --> 39:59.720
And uh, we have a link to jay's blog where he wrote all this up and he said you guys feel free to take as much

39:59.720 --> 40:02.680
Or as little of this as you want and I just wanted to get it out there right now

40:02.680 --> 40:05.160
We may combine that with a guide that we've already started

40:05.800 --> 40:08.600
But uh, we're kind of doing 100 things at once right now

40:08.600 --> 40:12.920
So it's just great to have somebody write that up. So thank you jay, and if you'd like to join us on the new

40:12.920 --> 40:18.040
Matrix server check that out. We have a link to it the linuxunplug.com. I think this is just a great

40:18.040 --> 40:23.560
You know just enough of a guide to where I found element decently easy to use and get started with but for folks

40:23.560 --> 40:25.720
Who've never tried it before go check out the video

40:25.720 --> 40:28.520
It'll have you up and up and chatting with us on matrix in no time

40:29.080 --> 40:31.080
Let's talk about this pick that we've been

40:31.480 --> 40:33.880
Sitting on for a couple of weeks because we've been super busy

40:33.880 --> 40:39.020
But this pick is really special for for one reason and one reason alone. It's written in rust

40:39.020 --> 40:42.560
For for one reason and one reason alone. It's written in rust

40:51.180 --> 40:54.460
So i'm going to give a i'm going to give a guess west it's pronounced ton shell

40:54.940 --> 40:58.860
Because you know, it's like tunnel and shell. Yeah, I think you got it. Okay, it's pretty neat

40:58.860 --> 41:03.260
Um, it's a simple secure method to remote shell into ephemeral environments

41:03.980 --> 41:06.620
And I like that they've got this question right at the top of the readme

41:06.620 --> 41:11.980
Why would I use this over my well-established ssh client good question

41:12.460 --> 41:18.140
You wouldn't the use case for ton shell is predominantly quick ad hoc remote access to hosts

41:18.140 --> 41:22.780
Which you may not have ssh access to so let's say you've embraced the craze

41:22.780 --> 41:26.940
You're using aws lambdas for just about everything now something goes wrong

41:27.340 --> 41:32.140
That's not really an environment you control and usually that's part of the value proposition, right?

41:32.140 --> 41:36.940
It's a quote-unquote serverless or at least hey, it's amazon servers. They're just running your app for you

41:37.180 --> 41:41.500
But sometimes you might need a little more information, but you can't set up an ssh server

41:41.900 --> 41:49.420
Well now you can because ton shell is a statically linked pre-compiled single binary that all you need to do is just download it

41:49.820 --> 41:52.380
Run it and boom now you've got ssh access

41:53.180 --> 41:56.860
I love that don't have ssh access. Well, we can fix that

41:58.540 --> 42:00.540
That's pretty neat i'm glad we finally got to this one

42:00.540 --> 42:05.260
Um, we have others that are in the winds. Is that the right? They're in the in the in the rafters

42:05.260 --> 42:09.340
What are you in the wings in the wings? Is that what what does that mean? What does in the wings mean?

42:09.900 --> 42:14.060
What does that even mean wes? I say I call bs on that saying wes ouch

42:14.780 --> 42:19.580
You know i've decided right here on the show, uh, but that doesn't mean we couldn't use some more suggestions

42:19.740 --> 42:23.980
so head over to linuxonplug.com slash contact if uh,

42:24.700 --> 42:29.500
If you've got a pick for us diddle, uh, you say, you know what uh in the wings means

42:29.500 --> 42:33.120
Uh, yeah, it's a theater term in the wings means uh backstage

42:33.660 --> 42:41.260
Okay, that makes sense waiting to make their debut right? They're backstage about to come out on stage. Okay. No. All right

42:41.260 --> 42:43.820
I retract my statement. I like it actually

42:45.500 --> 42:50.300
I think that's pretty great. Uh, all right. Well, yeah, we'll link to that in the uh show notes ton shell

42:50.780 --> 42:57.260
And it's the remote shell into an environment that uh, it's like a subspace environment, you know, this is how this is how in star trek

42:57.260 --> 43:03.740
They would get into a computer that was inside a subspace envelope as they would use ton shell because it's an ephemeral subspace environment

43:03.820 --> 43:06.300
You know this one for me actually I discovered it too late

43:06.540 --> 43:10.460
Just a few weeks ago. I was trying to debug some problems in an ephemeral environment

43:10.620 --> 43:13.580
And I didn't have a tool like this and it was driving me crazy

43:13.660 --> 43:17.020
So I think this is going to be one of those picks that actually makes it into my toolbox. All right

43:17.020 --> 43:22.140
Well, don't forget about that bugathon on september 8th after unplug show up for the show if you can and then stick around

43:22.220 --> 43:25.820
To help us make fedora 33 even better. We need your help

43:25.820 --> 43:27.900
I think it's a great way to kind of contribute, you know

43:27.980 --> 43:29.500
We use linux and desktop linux

43:29.500 --> 43:34.380
We take advantage of all these great projects and work of open source developers and even if you're not a fedora user

43:34.780 --> 43:39.420
It's not a bad way to just sort of stop by and give back a little bit and participate in the community as well

43:39.580 --> 43:46.300
So that'll be next tuesday as we record this and we encourage you to show up also again. Thank you to our

43:46.860 --> 43:48.860
core contributors you guys

43:49.340 --> 43:50.540
wow, um

43:50.540 --> 43:53.020
Amazing and also just a little interesting stat west

43:53.020 --> 43:57.100
Uh, it seems to me when I looked like it's split 50 50 like 50 people

43:57.180 --> 44:01.260
50 of people are using the bootleg feed and 50 of people are going with the ad free feed

44:01.260 --> 44:05.100
It's it's not like one is particularly more popular over the other

44:05.580 --> 44:10.220
Well when you've got two great options can be mighty hard to juice. Oh my god, wes

44:11.500 --> 44:13.100
Unplugged core.com

44:13.100 --> 44:16.300
Uh, we appreciate your support over there. Also, uh big

44:16.300 --> 44:20.300
Thank you to a cloud guru check out the new cloud guru cloud guru.com and also

44:20.300 --> 44:26.380
A big huge. Thank you to lanode, uh for sponsoring this show and making it possible for us to come back indie

44:26.460 --> 44:33.420
I am thrilled lanode.com slash unplugged go check out poppy on the ubuntu podcast and the new show

44:33.980 --> 44:39.340
Which uh, we'll have links. Hey, yo over there. Yeah. Hey, yo, hey, yo, go check that out over there

44:40.780 --> 44:43.180
It's uh, it's a good time mr. Payne

44:43.980 --> 44:46.220
What else should we mention? Maybe the show has a twitter account

44:46.220 --> 44:50.220
We hardly ever mention that at linux unplugged good way to get show updates anything else

44:50.700 --> 44:55.740
Come hang out with us on our new month matrix server. Sure. We've got to get good about the plugs on that one

44:56.140 --> 44:59.500
I'm at chris less. He's at west pain. The network is at jupiter signal

45:00.060 --> 45:05.100
And drew is at drew of doom. Thanks so much for tuning to this week's episode of the unplug program. Oh

45:05.100 --> 45:16.160
Linux action news is back. Check your feeds. See you next tuesday

45:35.420 --> 45:37.420
So

45:46.940 --> 45:51.020
West pain, I can't believe I forgot to mention linux action news is coming back. So as we record

45:51.980 --> 45:54.140
Monday probably the next monday you're hearing this

45:54.780 --> 45:58.300
There'll be a fresh brand new linux action news in your feeds

45:58.780 --> 46:03.100
I I feel so bad. I should have totally put that in the show. There's so much going on right now

46:03.100 --> 46:07.900
It's a good problem to have but I don't want to overwhelm people with the pluggy plugs either, but that's a big one

46:07.900 --> 46:13.580
I'm, very excited about lan. It's a literally huge news. It is very big and um, you know for me

46:13.580 --> 46:15.900
It's like uh, it's like it's a lifestyle change

46:16.220 --> 46:22.220
It is it's like I went a decade plus doing shows on sundays and then just stopped and now it's coming back

46:22.940 --> 46:26.620
The only the biggest downside for me is it lands during the lup lug

46:27.180 --> 46:30.940
So that'll be tricky, but i'll probably i'll try to maybe pop in early. I'm not sure

46:30.940 --> 46:34.380
I'm not sure what to do because we record at noon on sunday

46:34.620 --> 46:37.980
Which was funny because the lup lug started sort of right as the next sunday

46:38.140 --> 46:40.300
I would have been doing lan became lup lug time

46:40.540 --> 46:43.900
I think this just means you need to drag joe into the lup lug for a bit

46:43.980 --> 46:47.100
You know just dabble hang out for a few and then go get your work started

46:47.340 --> 46:51.500
We all know you like to chat before you work. Anyway could yeah, I could run two instances of mumble

46:51.500 --> 46:53.580
He wouldn't even have to do a thing. Don't give him the choice

46:53.580 --> 46:59.680
Yes, he'll love that surprise
