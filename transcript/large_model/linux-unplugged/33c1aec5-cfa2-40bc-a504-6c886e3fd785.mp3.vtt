WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
So it went up on you know the free software foundation is doing a big fundraiser right now

00:05.560 --> 00:09.920
They've raised a lot of money, but they're trying to get to five hundred and twenty five thousand dollars now

00:09.920 --> 00:12.560
They're at two hundred forty eight thousand dollars. That's not bad

00:13.280 --> 00:16.060
What's what what what are they gonna do with that money?

00:16.960 --> 00:20.000
Well, they it's their biggest fundraising event of the year

00:20.000 --> 00:22.920
They have a lot of work to do and this video makes the case for the work

00:22.920 --> 00:26.240
They have to do this video Popey the value of this is negative

00:26.240 --> 00:31.040
No, no, the value of this video is not negative this video that I'm about to play for you

00:31.040 --> 00:34.840
We'll tell you what they're gonna do with that money. They're gonna explain to you why you want to spend that money

00:34.840 --> 00:36.440
Are you are you ready?

00:36.440 --> 00:39.800
Feeling are you feeling while it downloads? No, it's downloaded now. Here we go

00:43.240 --> 00:47.200
Software is all around us and sometimes inside us

00:49.160 --> 00:53.240
But what happens when the tools we use are obeying someone else a

00:53.240 --> 00:56.980
Tool you control serves your interests

00:57.600 --> 00:59.600
But if someone else controls it

01:00.400 --> 01:02.400
They serve their own

01:02.600 --> 01:06.980
When you can examine tools to see how they work you're able to learn about them

01:07.880 --> 01:10.440
Even modify them to work differently or better

01:12.320 --> 01:17.760
When you can share a tool and its changes you help others and in turn they help you

01:17.760 --> 01:22.500
In fact, this is how early computing developed

01:23.760 --> 01:28.280
Everyone could see a program's code and people shared their work freely to drive its growth

01:31.360 --> 01:33.480
Every user was a potential author

01:36.400 --> 01:39.160
But when companies began to lock source code away

01:39.160 --> 01:47.400
It stopped being possible to participate or even to know what the code was doing in

01:49.200 --> 01:56.240
Response hackers formed the GNU project to create a computer system designed to respect the autonomy of users

01:57.760 --> 02:05.560
They adopted a copyleft maneuver and built it into the GNU general public license a legal structure that preserves user rights

02:05.560 --> 02:12.000
In ten short years the free software movement had produced the GNU Linux system

02:12.440 --> 02:15.280
Computing that nobody could own but anyone could use

02:18.160 --> 02:22.260
Today it's keeping planes in the air stocks trading

02:24.200 --> 02:26.200
And the global internet running

02:26.200 --> 02:32.840
We all encounter free software in invisible ways

02:33.320 --> 02:36.160
But software freedom was designed for people

02:36.880 --> 02:43.840
It's about what shape the technology we inhabit will take and what kind of society we use our digital powers to build

02:43.840 --> 02:45.840
And

02:54.200 --> 02:56.200
We've still got work to do

02:59.360 --> 03:05.000
Make the future and they show cross going across the screen a bunch of Linux desktop activities making art

03:06.120 --> 03:08.120
Using some of the best free software out there

03:08.120 --> 03:15.880
And it ends with 30 years of people of propelling user freedom the free software foundation 30 years of propelling user freedom

03:16.360 --> 03:18.360
Join us contribute and learn more

03:19.120 --> 03:23.060
Interestingly, I recognized one of the faces at the very end when it flicks around it was

03:24.240 --> 03:27.760
Jacob Applebaum from the tool project. Yeah in the video they were playing. Yeah

03:28.560 --> 03:32.240
So that's what they want to use the money for that they and you know

03:33.080 --> 03:34.720
You got oh, you got a kind of applaud

03:34.720 --> 03:40.400
I mean, that's a really well done video and it does help kind of explain what the idea is here that

03:40.920 --> 03:45.720
There is a new form of expression that is being locked away and the free software foundation wants to free it

03:45.720 --> 03:49.960
But they need support to do it. Hope we though you sound skeptical about where that money would go

03:50.520 --> 03:55.840
Well, no in the past I've been skeptical and that video doesn't actually say what the money

03:58.080 --> 04:00.960
And in the past many of the free software

04:00.960 --> 04:05.920
Foundation campaigns have been highly suspects like the

04:07.280 --> 04:13.320
Doing a denial of service attack on genius bar people in Apple stores. That was just moronic

04:13.840 --> 04:19.040
And they had a whole load of campaigns against Windows that were just ridiculous

04:19.040 --> 04:24.120
And so there was a lot of negative campaigning about proprietary software

04:24.120 --> 04:28.560
But not enough positive campaigning about the virtues of free software

04:28.560 --> 04:34.840
And I don't I think I think actually personally I think since Matt Lee left he was behind some of those campaigns

04:34.840 --> 04:39.800
I think they've turned around and they're doing more positive things. Yeah, this seem more positive and you know the it wraps

04:40.320 --> 04:42.320
with a free software user just

04:42.800 --> 04:48.960
Ripping through a whole bunch of really great free software apps now like with that video what I kind of thought about when I saw

04:48.960 --> 04:49.700
That video is oh, yeah

04:49.700 --> 04:53.920
We do have a ton of really good like just great apps now

04:53.920 --> 04:59.560
I was talking to Michael Dominic from Kota radio. I said so how's your switch to Ubuntu going?

04:59.560 --> 05:01.560
And he was he's like well

05:01.600 --> 05:07.880
You know truth be truth be told chrome is chrome and sublime text is sublime text and I need a terminal and it's working pretty

05:07.880 --> 05:11.020
Well, but I like it for everybody. It's something else like for him

05:11.020 --> 05:15.400
It's sublime text, but for somebody else is another application, and there just is more and more of them

05:16.320 --> 05:23.120
You know for me a really big change for 2014 is I managed to start editing the clips for unfilter

05:23.120 --> 05:29.320
Under Linux and doing it in a way that was better than I could accomplish the same task under OS 10 and for me

05:29.680 --> 05:33.360
That was a really really important moment because for a long time

05:33.360 --> 05:37.440
I've been able to accomplish a lot of the stuff with way more time and frustration under Linux now

05:37.440 --> 05:42.560
I'm not talking full editing, but there's a specific use case that I have for clips and unfilter that is

05:43.360 --> 05:46.640
Now it's better under Linux and lets me do more stuff

05:46.800 --> 05:52.040
Thanks to just some of the great apps that are available and so I think this video what they showed there at the end

05:52.040 --> 05:55.160
I was like, oh, yeah, that's awesome. That's great. So watching this back

05:55.160 --> 05:58.960
I'm like, this is a more positive free software foundation and it made me think more about

06:00.040 --> 06:02.040
their larger mission

06:02.080 --> 06:07.160
Without them having to come and put their larger mission right up in my face hole and saying this is what we're trying to do

06:07.160 --> 06:10.520
And I I felt like I don't I thought it was a good attempt

06:11.800 --> 06:15.840
Yeah, it's great video. It's good. It doesn't really say anything new to any of us

06:15.840 --> 06:18.840
Yeah, it's a good way to get the message out to normals. Yeah

06:18.840 --> 06:25.080
And and it was well produced to which appreciate. Yep. I'm looking to see they don't take Bitcoin though

06:25.840 --> 06:27.840
Sorry poppy you're out

06:28.440 --> 06:30.440
Yeah, I know you were looking forward to that

06:31.000 --> 06:35.880
But they would take PayPal. Oh, no, never mind. You can do Bitcoin. I'm sorry. I'm sorry

06:35.880 --> 06:39.800
You just can't do it through this campaign. You can just donate you could donate of course

06:39.800 --> 06:41.740
Oh, yeah, they've been taking Bitcoin donations for a long time

06:41.740 --> 06:45.960
But if you want to contribute directly to this fundraiser, it doesn't look like you can use Bitcoin

06:45.960 --> 06:52.520
So poppy, maybe I can tempt you into Bitcoin. You need to go and look up coin corner coin corner

06:53.080 --> 06:59.840
Yeah, it's a Bitcoin exchange in the Isle of Man, which I know it's very popular with somebody close to poppy

06:59.840 --> 07:03.800
Oh, oh, it might be might be a thing. Yeah, so it's a good it's a good exchange

07:03.800 --> 07:08.800
Sure, you can also oh you buried the lead wimpy. You can also buy and sell toes

07:08.800 --> 07:15.440
So yeah and like coin as well

07:17.200 --> 07:23.520
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that never ever provides financial advice

07:23.720 --> 07:29.880
My name is Chris. My name is Matt Matt. So episode 73 and we're doing it on December 30th

07:31.280 --> 07:33.020
2014 and last Sunday

07:33.020 --> 07:38.080
We had our chance to look into our action crystal balls and try to figure out what was gonna happen in the world of Linux

07:38.080 --> 07:44.000
A little behind-the-scene bit of information though that people may or may not be aware of especially if you didn't watch live

07:44.640 --> 07:46.760
That wasn't what we planned on doing that episode

07:46.760 --> 07:50.800
In fact, I think I'll check the show notes. You can probably get an idea of what we had planned to cover

07:51.880 --> 07:55.560
But things just sometimes with guests don't work out and you got to work

07:55.560 --> 07:58.880
You know, you got it. You got to work with that situation. You got to move on your feet

07:58.880 --> 08:02.640
You got a pivot as they say that's what they say Matt. They say pivot pivot always

08:02.640 --> 08:05.320
You got a pivot and so what Matt and I did is we pivoted

08:05.320 --> 08:08.280
And we just kind of came up with our 2015 predictions

08:08.840 --> 08:13.800
Literally on the fly as the bits were being committed to disk. We hadn't we didn't we didn't have a chance to think ahead

08:14.360 --> 08:16.200
really brainstorm

08:16.200 --> 08:20.140
Get in our zone, but now here we are episode 73 of the Linux unplugged program

08:20.140 --> 08:21.880
we are gonna be joined up by our

08:21.880 --> 08:27.680
Virtual Linux users group and we are going to bounce off each other the best set of 2015 predictions

08:27.680 --> 08:31.560
You will find anywhere on the internet for what is going to happen in Linux and how do I know that?

08:31.560 --> 08:35.560
Because I have faith in the people that we have assembled our mumble

08:35.560 --> 08:41.800
I have faith you might say of the heart and I think that probably be the best time to bring in the mumble room time

08:41.800 --> 08:43.800
appropriate greetings mumble room

08:50.080 --> 08:51.480
Really

08:51.480 --> 08:56.880
Nobody got the enterprise. So that happened. Oh, I'm sorry. I know it's the end. It's a holiday season man. I can't help it

08:56.880 --> 09:02.000
I always drop in Star Trek. Yeah, so we got it. We got it. I got I got I got a new bag of

09:03.040 --> 09:08.280
Balls that I brought that I'll pull out a few and rub and get some predictions out of I know the moment rooms got

09:08.280 --> 09:12.920
Some we already blew a few during the pre-show that we didn't mean to because I didn't have the record button going

09:12.920 --> 09:14.920
I blame wimpy and so

09:15.800 --> 09:19.440
And so what we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna have a bunch of good ones and I want to start though

09:20.160 --> 09:23.160
With some follow-up Linux unplugged shows all about the follow-up

09:23.160 --> 09:27.080
And the continuity if you will and I got to talk about telegram and Matt

09:27.080 --> 09:29.080
I love it cuz I know you sussed this one out

09:29.080 --> 09:33.020
Well, you saw in the subreddit. We were gonna have ourselves a bit of a problem with the telegram app pick

09:34.360 --> 09:39.320
Just a little bit. Yeah, I basically dropped in said hey guys, you don't care no stickers. I'm good. I walked away

09:40.960 --> 09:44.480
Just before the s-storm starts I'm just gonna lay this out there and I'm out

09:44.920 --> 09:52.040
I'm not coming back. I'm not coming back in this and that was wise and here's what happened is Chris got all excited about something

09:52.040 --> 09:53.000
and

09:53.000 --> 09:56.780
He talked about it and it was telegram and I got so excited about telegram

09:57.680 --> 10:04.120
That I actually even gave out my my contact information on telegram. Oh, that was great

10:06.680 --> 10:11.360
No, no, no, no, it's cool, you know, I've enjoyed talking to everybody it's been great

10:12.160 --> 10:19.080
Really have I got some actually my favorite one so far as I got some snow pictures from Australia. Oh, well, that's kind of cool

10:19.080 --> 10:22.380
Okay. Yeah, so Australia's got snow. I didn't even know that was a thing

10:22.380 --> 10:28.440
And now I've got a picture in telegram about it now telegram for those of you who didn't watch the world's largest Linux podcast

10:28.440 --> 10:33.900
That is a secure instant messaging program that promises the entire world when it comes to security

10:34.160 --> 10:39.400
And we've been using something called Viber. Yeah for Jupiter broadcasting production purposes

10:39.840 --> 10:46.280
And and Viber kind of does the same thing if you're familiar with WhatsApp or hangouts or any of this thing kind of stuff

10:46.280 --> 10:53.520
You get the idea they each have their varying levels of features a couple of core fundamentals that we have here

10:53.520 --> 10:57.840
And I'll just super quick because I know I'm retreading ground here and then we'll get into the telegram stuff because I think it's important

10:59.080 --> 11:01.080
our requirements are

11:01.340 --> 11:03.340
Mobile really has to be

11:03.920 --> 11:09.360
Just as supported if not the most supported and that's feels even dirty just saying that because I'm not that guy

11:09.360 --> 11:10.280
I'm all about the desktop

11:10.280 --> 11:13.440
but the fact is our production teams literally all over the world and

11:13.440 --> 11:20.720
They are oftentimes the majority of them or at least a significant portion of them are only available at that moment via their mobile

11:20.720 --> 11:26.720
So that's sort of right there sets our limitations of what our mediums are what our end devices are for communication

11:26.880 --> 11:30.180
And when you think of mobile you got to think about all of the restrictions therein

11:30.560 --> 11:35.100
they're also because there are producers there at FES and conferences and the

11:36.600 --> 11:39.660
Network at FES and conferences are notoriously bad

11:39.660 --> 11:45.200
Which means connectivity is always in a state of flux and you need to know if somebody sent a message and receive that message

11:45.200 --> 11:50.400
You need to know if the service acknowledges that you were able to transmit that message because your connectivity can be so fluctuating

11:50.580 --> 11:56.880
So that's a requirement we have from a messaging program. And then of course because it's the Linux action shown Linux unplugged mandatory

11:56.880 --> 11:58.120
It's got to run on Linux, right?

11:58.120 --> 12:01.800
We got to be able to have a Linux client because some of our back-end staff are on Macs

12:01.880 --> 12:05.000
Well to you got to have the Mac client, right?

12:05.000 --> 12:10.180
So you it's you you you you start to then of course, there's gonna be some people that need Windows. I don't know

12:10.240 --> 12:12.600
Probably rotten corpse wants it on Windows or something. I don't know

12:20.440 --> 12:23.200
On top of all of that then there's the features of that client

12:23.320 --> 12:27.160
Can it send pictures pictures are necessary because sometimes we just like to have fun

12:27.360 --> 12:29.860
Sometimes we got to send a picture of the booth what it looks like right?

12:30.200 --> 12:34.880
Can it send voice memos sometimes that's important because people are driving or you're giving something very complicated

12:34.880 --> 12:37.400
You don't want to type it all out. So does it do voice back and forth?

12:37.560 --> 12:41.960
there's those kinds of things that are critically important then you get to stuff like

12:43.160 --> 12:46.040
Is it encrypted? Is it private?

12:46.680 --> 12:49.240
If if you came to me and said Chris

12:49.240 --> 12:55.640
I believe there was a way that anybody in the Jupiter broadcasting audience could read any telegram thread. I

12:57.120 --> 13:00.420
Almost wouldn't care because there's nothing really in there

13:00.420 --> 13:07.320
That's confidential if I wanted to use a confidential messaging platform. Well, I sure as hell wouldn't use somebody else's service, right?

13:07.320 --> 13:10.440
I would go fire up my own XMPP right?

13:10.440 --> 13:15.920
I would make sure I'm using a fully open source client to use that XMPP server and to be totally frank

13:15.920 --> 13:22.520
Like if I'm super paranoid, I probably don't even use a computer right Matt exactly

13:22.520 --> 13:23.120
Well, that's just it

13:23.120 --> 13:27.640
I mean first and foremost my two rules in life are if it executes code it can be exploited

13:27.640 --> 13:34.280
And if it's communication besides actually, I don't know keeping it in your brain. It can be exploited same thing applies

13:34.280 --> 13:36.460
I mean really I mean even paper and pen can be exploited

13:36.460 --> 13:40.640
So, I mean, I think a lot of people got to figure out how deep they want to dive into that and in reality

13:40.640 --> 13:43.800
You know, does it use some base level encryption? Yeah, it sounds like it. Okay, cool

13:43.800 --> 13:44.240
All right

13:44.240 --> 13:49.120
So that is where we're coming out from telegram and we got some feedback around telegram

13:49.640 --> 13:53.040
And a lot of it centers around the encryption that telegram uses and wimpy

13:53.040 --> 13:56.420
I wanted to give you a chance to jump in because I know you know about it at contests they have going

13:56.420 --> 13:59.740
Yeah, well, this is the second contest they've run now

13:59.740 --> 14:05.020
So they've they've put out a three hundred thousand dollar bounty for somebody that can crack

14:05.260 --> 14:10.700
The the encryption on telegram and every so often they keep bumping the value up

14:10.700 --> 14:14.380
So it started at a hundred thousand then it was two hundred thousand now

14:14.380 --> 14:16.780
It's three hundred thousand and they keep on

14:17.380 --> 14:22.820
Relaxing the rules of engagement as the bounty goes up and nobody's broken it yet. So they're obviously

14:22.820 --> 14:27.380
Fairly confident in in their encryption

14:29.260 --> 14:36.220
Yeah, I'm not trying I'm not coming here to advocate for telegram is encryption or one way or the other

14:37.460 --> 14:41.580
because you know it it sounds like from my understanding is

14:42.440 --> 14:49.140
They still have the the problem where telegram could hand over in keys and some a third party could get involved in the conversation

14:49.140 --> 14:54.900
If not for anything else other than monitoring and beat off on the subreddit writes in he says being the good

14:55.340 --> 14:57.980
Being good. Okay. Here's Paul. Oh, he's taking a shot at me

14:57.980 --> 15:04.280
I see he says being good at going full salesman on things comes with a certain responsibility. Apparently. I'm full salesman on telegram

15:04.980 --> 15:10.500
If you care about your audience, okay. All right. Thanks. All right. How dare you like a product Chris? What were you thinking?

15:10.500 --> 15:16.340
Yeah, come on touting the security of telegram should be avoided by all means use it if it fits your needs

15:16.340 --> 15:20.500
But please don't portray telegram as something vetted and secure

15:20.580 --> 15:24.100
That's doing the audience a disservice only half of the equation

15:24.100 --> 15:28.340
The client is open source and the protocol is full of weirdness and outright flaws

15:28.340 --> 15:35.320
I believe their crypto contest charade was even featured and scoffed at on one of the network's channels a while ago

15:35.940 --> 15:41.360
Perhaps if its encryption score is the following table then he links to the EFF

15:41.860 --> 15:43.860
He includes the EFF

15:43.860 --> 15:47.100
Or card of secure messaging clients. They did recently and

15:48.660 --> 15:51.060
I'm looking for telegram on the list right here

15:52.700 --> 15:59.700
If it's if it's so flawed and they've been offering a hundred thousand two hundred thousand three hundred thousand dollars then

16:00.260 --> 16:04.100
That that's enough motivation for people that know their stuff

16:04.660 --> 16:10.780
Break it and claim the prize money and that hasn't happened yet. And what I get from these crypto contests

16:10.780 --> 16:14.820
I haven't looked into the crypto in any any degree but they're clearly thinking about

16:15.300 --> 16:19.100
Cryptography first rather than an afterthought and it's baked into the product

16:19.900 --> 16:21.900
Yeah, I say telegram

16:22.740 --> 16:28.220
They you know, they I'm looking at this core the scorecard here from the EFF has there been a recent code on it

16:28.220 --> 16:35.020
They say fail that check mark that checkbox and our past communication secure if your keys are stolen and they don't have that checkbox

16:35.020 --> 16:38.340
I would also add I believe the way telegram works is at some level

16:38.340 --> 16:42.700
They're storing your messages on their server until all of your clients have downloaded. That's probably something you should be worried about, too

16:43.860 --> 16:49.180
You not only that but I mean stepping back to the show and what we actually what you actually said about it specifically

16:49.180 --> 16:55.380
I seem to remember the words not open source used open protocol and is reasonably secure

16:55.380 --> 16:59.580
I mean was kind of that, you know, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't really under I mean it's like well

16:59.580 --> 17:03.700
Okay, so I can't use online banking because that hasn't really been vetted. I sure as hell haven't vetted it

17:03.700 --> 17:09.380
I can't use anything with you know, any type of SSL because I personally haven't vetted it and I don't know who does

17:09.380 --> 17:12.780
You know, I mean you can just it just becomes a really ridiculous argument

17:12.780 --> 17:17.820
Well, I guess that's kind of where I wanted to take this like if I feature something on the Linux action show like telegram

17:18.760 --> 17:24.140
What is my level of responsibility for that disclaiming that kind of stuff? Yeah

17:26.080 --> 17:31.040
The fact that hey, I really like this product here's the fact that it's open protocol and we're using it

17:31.040 --> 17:33.780
I think it's kind of you kind of hit all the nails on the head

17:33.780 --> 17:36.900
I think I mean if you really look at it logically, I don't understand how

17:37.900 --> 17:44.300
That's unclear. I don't recall you saying that this is NSA quality encryption or you're like, you know

17:44.300 --> 17:45.980
I mean, I guess I'm just confused by the whole thing

17:45.980 --> 17:51.300
Well, what is here's some good news and by the way, I will link in the show notes. We've also in the subreddit

17:51.740 --> 17:56.380
You know, there was a link to somebody who takes apart some of the some of the issues with the protocol

17:56.380 --> 17:57.900
Which is totally legit

17:57.900 --> 18:02.780
It's fine, but there and then somebody also linked and I meant to grab the name

18:02.780 --> 18:09.540
I'm sorry a really good stack exchange thread where somebody a hello world goes there

18:09.540 --> 18:13.660
I'm really does break down kind of like if you are super super concerned about

18:15.060 --> 18:19.620
Really secure chat perfectly secure chat. Here are the things you need to consider

18:19.620 --> 18:24.300
some of them are design philosophy things some are just the way the telegram works and

18:24.300 --> 18:29.660
Some of them are perhaps key issues and I thought this was a really good article and last but not least

18:29.660 --> 18:33.860
I also was provided a hundred percent open source

18:34.980 --> 18:39.000
Android client for telegram in the f-droid marketplace or whatever you call it

18:39.000 --> 18:43.980
And this is completely GPL to and it it's a it's an open source client

18:45.260 --> 18:50.140
So I guess my take is as I it seems like a lot of people have really been enjoying telegram based on the message

18:50.140 --> 18:52.660
Yeah, I think our whole team is pretty much switched over now too

18:52.660 --> 18:56.340
Which is happens really usually when the whole team adopts something like that that fast

18:57.620 --> 19:00.500
Usually is a good sign. I think what people have really liked is

19:00.980 --> 19:04.980
It it's very clean and I think Matt you kind of like it doesn't have like a Fisher Price field

19:04.980 --> 19:09.860
Oh, man, you know, I love this. I loved it when viral be like, hey, you know, you need you need a sticker

19:09.860 --> 19:11.860
It's three in the morning. Let me send you

19:12.020 --> 19:17.700
It's like seriously leave you and then you dismiss it that keeps coming back. I don't get that with this. I love it

19:17.700 --> 19:19.700
They sold me. What do you think in rotten corpse?

19:19.700 --> 19:26.740
I'll just wanted to point out that you know when you featured Viber a couple months ago or so and

19:27.460 --> 19:29.140
No one freaked out

19:29.140 --> 19:33.380
But for some reason when something you're featuring an alternative that's more open

19:33.380 --> 19:35.620
It may be not open source in the client

19:35.620 --> 19:41.900
But open protocol and there are clients that use the protocol that are open source that you can easily use and

19:41.900 --> 19:49.220
But then people are freaking out about the one that's more open and didn't snap on the only one that's completely proprietary

19:49.660 --> 19:53.900
Yeah, that is interesting. I guess maybe it's because it's more of the category. I don't know

19:54.580 --> 20:01.060
I I'm not quite sure that's a good observation. I wouldn't be I know you had a note about a Android client

20:01.940 --> 20:04.540
Yeah, so I had been using

20:05.060 --> 20:09.260
WhatsApp for a couple of years and all of our family over our Christmas gathering

20:09.260 --> 20:15.780
We've all switched over to tell it telegram on our Android phones and we're using telegram telegram X

20:16.220 --> 20:20.100
For Android, which is made by delicious, which are the same people behind

20:20.900 --> 20:24.780
The chomp and texture SMS clients. So if you've ever used those

20:25.660 --> 20:27.660
It's a really decent

20:27.980 --> 20:29.460
messaging

20:29.460 --> 20:36.080
Implementation that's familiar to the chomp and texture users but uses telegram. It's pretty good. No kidding chomp is awesome

20:36.080 --> 20:41.620
So yeah now I'm more excited to use that. Yeah, that is really I did see I did see them

20:42.380 --> 20:48.020
Telegram X they've wonder though whether it was just a clone or something to be trusted or not

20:48.500 --> 20:52.340
So that's good that it's been vetted. Thanks. Yeah, I will grab that

20:52.900 --> 20:55.980
I've been pretty impressed overall with the speed of it, too

20:55.980 --> 21:01.580
I didn't I didn't have a good way to demo it on air on on on Sunday, but

21:01.580 --> 21:06.800
You know, I'm sometimes I'm when I have these chats going I've got it on my mobile device and two computers at the same

21:06.800 --> 21:08.800
Time and I am I am blown away with

21:09.200 --> 21:13.520
It's not perfect. But a lot of times I send a message and it shows up on all three devices

21:14.600 --> 21:19.880
Instantaneously, like I don't even see how I could transfer the data that fast and yet it's there now that said I

21:20.720 --> 21:26.040
Have been it's funny because like I think sometimes a lot I come to these things and I test them in a way

21:26.040 --> 21:30.160
They've never been tested like I kind of did this to bit message and now I've done it to myself a telegram

21:30.160 --> 21:35.800
Where I put myself out there and so what ends up happening is I just get an S ton of messages and I think sometimes

21:35.800 --> 21:42.160
these messaging systems have never had somebody that has that happen and so I'm noticing like the desktop client will not show like if

21:42.160 --> 21:43.760
I get say

21:43.760 --> 21:47.020
Like it like you say I don't say I have the desktop client open

21:47.600 --> 21:54.440
And maybe overnight I get eight new chat sessions start and they'll all show up on my smartphone

21:54.440 --> 21:56.040
But when I open up my desktop

21:56.040 --> 22:01.200
I have to close the telegram desktop client and open it again before the chat show up and I prefer to reply on the computer

22:02.040 --> 22:03.880
So yeah

22:03.880 --> 22:04.880
Anyways, there you go

22:04.880 --> 22:10.040
and the other last last thing I'll say about telegram is the other thing that's nice is you can give out a user ID instead

22:10.040 --> 22:12.920
of your phone number with like other messaging programs and

22:13.600 --> 22:18.000
you can integrate it in with pigeon because they've already right written a plug-in for lib purple and

22:18.600 --> 22:22.640
You can just use your existing desktop messaging client, which is kind of cool. I'm not saying it's

22:22.640 --> 22:26.640
Don't forget the fact that you can also say that it's a whatsapp club

22:27.200 --> 22:33.720
Basically, so it's very very easy to show to others because they'll pick it up straight away. Ah good to nice

22:34.320 --> 22:40.260
All right. Oh, go ahead one last one last. Yeah. Sorry. I'd also like to add that

22:40.960 --> 22:46.800
It's also available for Firefox OS. I just had a look. Yes. Thank you. That's right. I meant to mention that

22:46.800 --> 22:48.800
It is on Firefox OS as well

22:48.800 --> 22:52.840
So there you go. Okay won't be one last one. Go ahead. This is the last last one

22:53.880 --> 22:56.960
Yeah, what my family liked about it is unlike whatsapp

22:56.960 --> 23:03.520
They were able to have telegram on their phones and their tablets and have their entire message history available

23:03.520 --> 23:09.760
So it didn't matter what device they were on they were able to see all of their messages receive all of their messages and reply

23:10.840 --> 23:15.600
Yeah, that is really nice, especially for like the family members that switch to the tablet

23:15.600 --> 23:19.260
Once I go sit on the couch and watch TV, that's we have we have family members

23:19.260 --> 23:23.960
I just noticed when we went over to the for the holidays that just have the tablet next to their favorite table

23:23.960 --> 23:25.760
That's next to their favorite chair, right?

23:25.760 --> 23:31.160
And when they're watching TV, the favorite tablet comes out and they sit there and they play on the tablet

23:31.160 --> 23:36.280
I'm guessing I don't think it ever leaves that spot and the fact that they often don't have their phone with them when they're sitting

23:36.280 --> 23:37.760
there

23:37.760 --> 23:41.660
Is is a is a big boost for a telegram

23:41.660 --> 23:46.140
Yeah, so yeah, and I I think it I think overall

23:46.820 --> 23:50.720
The thing to sort of note about this is this is our last episode of 2014

23:50.720 --> 23:54.940
And this is obviously going to be a huge area in 2015

23:55.460 --> 23:58.420
And I hate to be that guy, but this is the post Snowden

23:58.420 --> 24:05.860
This is one of the butterfly effects of the Edward Snowden leaks is everybody's hyper conscious now about encryption and and a little more

24:05.940 --> 24:09.020
Suspect about encryption when people are saying we have PhDs

24:09.020 --> 24:13.720
So you can trust us and then people are not trusting them like they used to so some of the pushback

24:13.720 --> 24:16.960
We are seeing about telegram is like totally legit

24:16.960 --> 24:17.900
like exactly

24:17.900 --> 24:23.500
Where our head should be at now because we've just gone through a year of some shit and it really has shown us that we need

24:23.500 --> 24:28.020
To be a little bit more critical of this stuff. So I'm not I'm not begrudging anybody

24:28.020 --> 24:33.300
I just wanted to clarify that you know, this is where we are taking the input on this on this topic

24:33.300 --> 24:37.140
It's something we're thinking about. I'm not totally sure though like for us if it matters

24:37.140 --> 24:41.620
so you just have to make those same kind of values at value decisions yourself and

24:42.020 --> 24:45.660
There you go. Actually if you if you're cool with everything we talked about check out telegram

24:45.660 --> 24:47.460
I think you'll like it quite a bit and

24:47.460 --> 24:49.980
it looks like a lot of people in the mobile room are using it too and

24:50.860 --> 24:53.740
When we go out to events and stuff, we'll really put it through its paces

24:54.540 --> 24:55.380
Okay

24:55.380 --> 25:00.340
So I think the real thing to just kind of leave it out is it's something that we like that serves a purpose for us

25:00.540 --> 25:02.540
that's pretty much where it comes down and and

25:02.540 --> 25:09.020
That doesn't mean that in the future. You won't see a segment from us on like like an awesome XMPP server setup or something

25:09.020 --> 25:10.700
Like that. It's just for

25:10.700 --> 25:14.860
For us and going out in the field to make these shows for you that that that's what works for us

25:14.860 --> 25:19.500
And it's a huge part of it really and it's really hard for me to wrap my head around is

25:19.740 --> 25:26.100
That we needed something that was that was genuinely mobile first because so much of our team is on their mobile and they always have

25:26.100 --> 25:28.100
a data connection on their mobile and when they're at

25:28.100 --> 25:33.540
Conferences they're on their mobile and that was something that once once I had made that as Matt and I like to call it

25:33.660 --> 25:36.780
New term pivot once I'd made that pivot

25:36.780 --> 25:40.480
I had realized this is I got to rethink the way I'm doing this

25:40.700 --> 25:48.180
And speaking of mobile and rethinking mobile and making sense ting go to linux.ting.com right now sponsor of the Linux unplugged show

25:48.540 --> 25:53.220
Linux dot ting comm will take $25 off your ting device if you have a ting

25:53.660 --> 25:56.340
Compatible device and there's more and more of them and in February

25:56.340 --> 26:01.380
There'll be even more because ting's going GSM's you got CMA and GSM if you have a ting compatible device

26:01.380 --> 26:06.860
They're gonna give you $25 of credit that might just pay for your first month. It often does it did for me

26:07.540 --> 26:11.140
Linux dot ting comm go check them out and try out their savings calculator

26:11.140 --> 26:15.700
You plug in your existing information and see how much ting would make a difference for you for me

26:15.700 --> 26:19.460
it's a huge difference because it's no contract and no early termination fee, but

26:20.100 --> 26:22.100
what I really love and

26:22.100 --> 26:26.660
And to be honest like to know where the termination fee thing like

26:28.060 --> 26:30.820
That's nice if you're in a contract, but for me that doesn't matter

26:30.820 --> 26:35.660
I'm not gonna switch from ting like that nowhere the nowhere the termination fee is not a big incentive for me anymore

26:35.660 --> 26:40.620
I can totally get like a family if I'm in the old paradigm like that. Oh wow really that's great

26:40.620 --> 26:45.660
No ETF like how can they even do that well turns out they can right? It's easy now

26:45.660 --> 26:46.980
I'm it now that I'm a ting customer

26:46.980 --> 26:49.220
It's not the no ETF that keeps me around that doesn't make any sense

26:49.220 --> 26:53.660
What keeps me around is that I'm only paying for my daily usage

26:53.660 --> 26:56.540
They just what I use so if I make a couple of calls today

26:56.540 --> 26:57.700
I'll just pay for that

26:57.700 --> 26:59.620
Yeah, I don't have to have a huge plan

26:59.620 --> 27:01.900
But if I need to make a ton of calls this the plan

27:02.100 --> 27:08.360
Easily scales and the pricing makes a ton of sense ting just takes your minutes your messages and your megabytes whatever you use

27:08.660 --> 27:10.940
That's what you have to pay well guess what?

27:11.660 --> 27:15.500
Guess what just happened to me my files box died at my house

27:15.500 --> 27:19.220
My firewall is fine all of that's fine the lands fine

27:19.340 --> 27:25.300
But the literally the Ethernet port on my files box sitting outside in the freezing weather popped last night

27:26.460 --> 27:28.900
Yesterday no no internet for Chris well

27:29.740 --> 27:34.500
What would I do just call up my cell phone provider and change my data plan for that month? Oh?

27:35.660 --> 27:43.400
Hello mr. Carrier. Yes, I need 10 gigabytes this month and not the regular 2 gigabytes that I know dude

27:43.400 --> 27:49.380
I pay for what I use I just turn on the hotspot tethering and now the devices in my house connect to my Nexus 5 over

27:49.380 --> 27:55.140
The Wi-Fi and we're going out over tings LTE. I'm paying for my usage because that's how it should work

27:55.140 --> 28:00.700
It's mobile it makes sense to give you tools to watch all of this you can set alerts with their Android or iOS app and they

28:00.700 --> 28:02.100
Have no hold customer service

28:02.100 --> 28:07.860
They've got a ton of great devices over at the ting store if you want to just grab a GSM sim you can or you can

28:07.860 --> 28:13.340
Go up and get yourself anything from the latest Android devices to a feature phone like I pulled out this feature

28:13.340 --> 28:16.740
Phone here the kill Sara Verve the kill Sara Verve

28:18.060 --> 28:21.220
It's like wow okay. Yeah, I see a number pad there wait

28:21.220 --> 28:23.700
So you mean I use that number pad to make phone calls that's weird

28:23.700 --> 28:28.060
It's got a camera, but then check out this badness slide down full QWERTY keyboard

28:28.060 --> 28:32.660
Yeah, you can still get one no contract. No early termination fee a hundred and seven dollars when you go to linux.ting.com

28:33.380 --> 28:38.900
Why not I mean if you just need a phone why not right all right? Here's another example the iPhone 5s

28:39.780 --> 28:41.780
315 dollars no contract

28:41.780 --> 28:46.000
Right on ting are my favorite the HTC one

28:46.740 --> 28:48.740
no contract

28:49.340 --> 28:53.820
$340 linux.ting.com and they've got the latest and greatest devices they got everything

28:54.340 --> 28:58.160
Linux.ting.com go over to ting try out the savings calculator

28:58.780 --> 29:00.540
And then just go look at those devices

29:00.540 --> 29:06.380
And then keep your eye out because in February things getting even better when they go to GSM linux.ting.com and a huge

29:06.380 --> 29:09.220
Thank you to ting for sponsoring the linux unplugged program

29:09.220 --> 29:12.060
Love you guys good stuff

29:12.780 --> 29:18.540
Okay, what can we do just a couple more quick emails before we get the predictions? I know absolutely okay?

29:18.540 --> 29:23.260
all right, okay, so I know I'm honestly not trying to get us in trouble, but

29:23.780 --> 29:30.980
You know snow train great username writes in and says why isn't Debian as popular as Ubuntu on last

29:30.980 --> 29:32.380
He says I great question

29:32.380 --> 29:36.540
I've been following and loving last for some time now, and you know so he probably knows both you

29:36.540 --> 29:41.660
And I love Debian, but he says it always bothers me that Debian the mother of so many great Linux distributions

29:41.660 --> 29:48.140
Isn't discussed as a primary Linux distro option when you just throw things out there like arch open Sousa Ubuntu and so on

29:48.220 --> 29:49.620
What's the deal with that?

29:49.620 --> 29:53.460
Thanks for the great year and queue up the good work on last so what he's saying to us Matt is like

29:53.740 --> 29:58.820
Not like why don't you do more things about Debbie, but like when you're just saying hey try out open Sousa

29:58.820 --> 30:05.420
Hey try out fedora. Why isn't Debian in that sentence? What are your thoughts well for me personally as a general rule?

30:05.420 --> 30:08.120
I found that packaging is generally my first thing I look at

30:08.380 --> 30:12.100
And this is probably all wrong in most people's eyes, but for me packaging is the first thing

30:12.100 --> 30:14.760
I look at when I look at a distro arch and Ubuntu nail it

30:15.380 --> 30:17.460
Open Sousa, you know they do pretty well

30:17.460 --> 30:20.420
Thanks to their packaging service and whatnot and all the goodies they got going on

30:20.420 --> 30:25.220
But when it comes to Debian, it's kind of hit and miss if it's not in an existing repo

30:25.220 --> 30:30.060
You're generally gonna be hunting down a dead package or adding your own repo, which is a whole nother set of issues

30:30.660 --> 30:33.580
I do use Debian on a netbook

30:33.580 --> 30:37.780
I actually have lot OS on a netbook right now, and it's a great little distro

30:37.780 --> 30:40.980
I love it all day what I brag about it or recommend it to people no

30:41.420 --> 30:45.300
I would recommend it to an advanced user maybe even an intermediate user

30:45.300 --> 30:47.860
But I wouldn't recommend it casually just hand in foot

30:47.860 --> 30:53.500
so I think also some of it comes from a little bit of bias for me in terms of

30:54.820 --> 30:57.580
Well actually ninja Aaron said it best he said dude

30:57.580 --> 31:04.580
Linux action show when does Debian do something exciting when they do that's when they cover it for the most part

31:04.580 --> 31:10.700
Debbie just plugs along and keeps going and doing its thing for which we are all very grateful on the other hand

31:10.700 --> 31:16.400
It was basically all they talked about in Linux unplugged this year, and let's not kid ourselves Debian's fonts yikes

31:17.020 --> 31:22.300
Yeah, so snow train falls up. He says I understand that Debian isn't covered very much by other distros

31:22.700 --> 31:26.760
But he thinks that maybe we should talk more about it and Red Hat Enterprise Linux and slackware as well

31:26.760 --> 31:29.280
So that's fair enough. It is fair

31:29.280 --> 31:32.720
I mean you know to get Debbie into I don't know to get it to where you really want it

31:32.720 --> 31:35.920
It requires a little nipple rubbing and it sounds a little weird to say that but it's true

31:35.920 --> 31:38.680
You got to kind of massage things out to get everything where you want it

31:38.680 --> 31:39.820
You got to work with your fonts

31:39.820 --> 31:43.280
You got to kind of decide on what you want to look where which desktop all this stuff

31:43.280 --> 31:48.440
You know it's not really an out-of-the-box experience in my opinion so okay, so last email of the day

31:48.440 --> 31:50.640
And I got the whole mumble room here

31:50.640 --> 31:55.580
I know a lot of us looked at fedora 21 a lot of people in the chat room have been trying out fedora 21

31:55.580 --> 31:58.420
The new anaconda installer isn't new for 21

31:58.420 --> 32:03.800
But it's new ish, and it's new enough that Erno writes in he says I've been a linux user since the year

32:05.180 --> 32:06.380
2000

32:06.380 --> 32:13.900
And I can install a linux system without a problem I've I've I have probably installed hundreds of linux distros over the years

32:14.260 --> 32:20.740
I've been meaning to try out fedora sabian and other distros that use the anaconda installer specifically as

32:20.740 --> 32:27.660
For the life of me though. I cannot figure out how to use and set up a multi-disk setup in anaconda

32:27.660 --> 32:34.020
Is it just me or is the anaconda installer way too damn

32:34.820 --> 32:36.820
complex after the redesign

32:36.940 --> 32:39.740
Thanks, huh, what do you think Matt? Did you find it complex?

32:40.020 --> 32:45.000
You know I was doing a solid like a just a flat install, so I wasn't doing anything multiple partition

32:45.000 --> 32:46.180
I know the auto thing too

32:46.180 --> 32:46.680
Yeah

32:46.680 --> 32:51.860
Now if I was to try that it would be interesting because I'm pretty sensitive to that not because I can't but because I expect

32:51.860 --> 32:53.860
That sort of thing I expect it to just work well

32:54.060 --> 32:59.980
I'll have to take a look I did run into a few issues with the partitioner where like if I had existing partitions

33:00.220 --> 33:05.540
That I wanted totally wiped out the part the auto the partitioners auto suggestion system was like

33:05.780 --> 33:09.220
Never would never suggest anything that would wipe data of course because it's trying to be safe

33:09.260 --> 33:14.280
But that's actually so I felt a little inflexible because I said I wanted to have an auto option that said just use the whole

33:14.280 --> 33:18.380
Drive anybody anybody in the mumble room have any thoughts on anaconda a rotten corpse

33:18.380 --> 33:22.260
I see you just said something chat go ahead, and what do you think about anaconda? Did you find it complex?

33:24.020 --> 33:26.260
Well I'd say it's probably like a

33:27.060 --> 33:31.780
Intermediate, but it's a it's more complex than it needs to be but but you what you're saying is you don't want them

33:32.280 --> 33:37.020
My anaconda don't want on okay, all right. Thanks. That's all that

33:37.820 --> 33:40.500
I think it's just a transition thing or no

33:40.500 --> 33:44.540
It has been a little more complicated than I would like for a while, but at the same time. I still

33:45.060 --> 33:49.860
There's only a few installers. I like the ubiquity installer. I like quite a bit the anaconda installers, okay

33:49.860 --> 33:51.860
I mean, it's just

33:52.100 --> 33:57.620
Yeah, yeah, sitchie sitchie's all right. Yeah, I don't even know how you say it, but yes, it she's okay

33:57.620 --> 34:02.500
Yeah, I think it's cinchy. I don't cinchy. Oh that would make sense. It's like a cinch. Yeah sure

34:02.500 --> 34:10.140
Yeah, as far as I as far as I'm concerned the best installers freebsd installer and all the other players can go home

34:11.580 --> 34:17.060
All right, so we do have a few things to get into we have of course our predictions

34:17.060 --> 34:22.820
And we have a couple of more a couple other items to get to in the show it is the last episode of 2014 and

34:23.180 --> 34:29.300
We have our 2015 shenanigans to get into so before we do that before we talk about all of that stuff

34:29.300 --> 34:35.900
Let's talk about digital ocean. You know that's where I spin up my droplets. I think I I probably over 2014

34:35.900 --> 34:37.900
I probably did like a

34:38.060 --> 34:42.340
Total of like 15 droplets. I think I've kept three that's one of the things I love about digital ocean

34:42.780 --> 34:44.700
Because when something just strikes my fancy

34:44.700 --> 34:47.340
I just go over there and create it because I can get started right away

34:47.700 --> 34:50.900
Digital ocean is really really simple and very intuitive

34:51.180 --> 34:54.820
The dedicated offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin up a cloud server

34:54.820 --> 34:59.700
You can go over there right now and use our promo code. I mean this is the last day for you to use it

34:59.700 --> 35:04.300
But it'll work for a little while into January. Don't worry, and it'll give you a $10 credit

35:04.300 --> 35:09.020
It's unplugged December, and you can get started in less than a minute when you go over to digital ocean

35:09.020 --> 35:11.020
So you get think about that if you got an idea

35:11.500 --> 35:17.340
Your vert you start a virtual box on your clunker. I mean that's gonna start in like a minute right, but you can get a whole

35:18.100 --> 35:24.300
Sweet rig spun up on digital ocean in less than a minute, and you get an amazing interface on top of that

35:24.300 --> 35:27.860
It's such a better way to go and then when you want to slide it in production

35:27.860 --> 35:33.620
It's so easy to do so you get started in less than a minute and pricing plan start only five dollars a month

35:34.340 --> 35:35.380
five

35:35.380 --> 35:38.740
Dollars for our Linux rig that you have root access you can install any package

35:38.740 --> 35:45.300
They've got one click installations here to get 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of freaking transfer

35:45.300 --> 35:47.220
For you yours you can have that

35:47.220 --> 35:52.460
For five dollars a month and digital ocean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore

35:52.460 --> 35:55.940
Amsterdam and a really nice one in London I

35:56.580 --> 35:58.620
You know it's like as like sponsors

35:58.620 --> 36:01.780
They should probably send me to the London data center so I can tell you more about it

36:01.780 --> 36:05.620
They should probably just you know just so you might want to put that bug in there

36:05.620 --> 36:09.420
They can run with that if they want to I'm just an idea guy, but it's the interface

36:09.420 --> 36:14.740
That's what keeps me going back when I when I know I got to go do something. It's it's never like oh, man

36:14.740 --> 36:19.000
I got to go manage this I could take care of this like let's go cuz it's the digital ocean interface

36:19.000 --> 36:23.820
That's really really the sweet thing. It's simple and intuitive, but very powerful and power

36:23.820 --> 36:28.420
You just can replicate the interface on a larger scale with digital oceans excellent API

36:28.420 --> 36:31.100
And they have not only great documentation

36:31.100 --> 36:34.460
but a bunch of really good community open source apps that you can use for inspiration or

36:34.780 --> 36:38.420
Libraries that you can just take advantage of already and save you a ton of the work

36:38.420 --> 36:42.860
I think one of the coolest things though digital ocean has done over there sort of the latter half of 2014 and

36:43.900 --> 36:48.340
The audience for Jupiter broadcasting has really paid a huge played a huge role in this

36:48.340 --> 36:50.700
Has been the tutorials at digital ocean

36:51.140 --> 36:55.920
Right they they now are getting to the point kind of like where the arch wiki is like when you google for something

36:56.060 --> 37:00.780
Like what you find is like a digital ocean tutorial and an arch wiki tutorial on it

37:00.780 --> 37:07.340
And and like that's the level of quality they're getting to because digital ocean is doubling down in this area

37:07.340 --> 37:12.620
They're paying you a Jupiter broadcasting listener to go over that you can use the link in our show notes

37:12.620 --> 37:18.540
And there's no gimmick. There's no trick. They just they really want good content in their tutorial section

37:18.540 --> 37:23.340
So they will pay you up to $200 for it. They'll have you work with their editor, and this is an area

37:23.340 --> 37:28.900
They're investing because once you get going in under a minute with your droplet you get something deployed on there with a one-click installation

37:28.900 --> 37:34.860
Maybe the entire docker setup. Maybe it's the lamp stack. Maybe it's git lab. Maybe it's ghost. I don't know it own cloud

37:34.860 --> 37:36.980
I mean, it's so easy to get things going over there

37:36.980 --> 37:42.540
But then if you ever hit a bump you have those tutorials you can fall back on but if you're an expert like I'm not

37:42.540 --> 37:46.980
Gonna run into a bump. I'm an expert you can still go take advantage of digital ocean and write the tutorial and get paid up to

37:46.980 --> 37:48.220
$200

37:48.220 --> 37:52.980
I'm really I think it's an area that they've and they've really like the hardware is incredibly fast

37:53.300 --> 38:00.920
The bandwidth is tier one bandwidth out of these data centers the interface is bar none best in the industry all running on top

38:00.920 --> 38:05.380
of Linux KVM SSDs, and they're like you know what else we need to do tutorials and

38:06.100 --> 38:11.860
Of course sponsor your favorite Linux podcast digital ocean calm unplug December when you check out and a big

38:11.860 --> 38:18.980
Thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the Linux unplugged program. You guys are firing on all cylinders. I love their tutorials

38:18.980 --> 38:22.660
I'll tell you if I had a dollar for every time I came back to those like oh, that's how you do that

38:22.660 --> 38:24.780
Oh, yeah, it's great. It's good for it's I mean

38:24.780 --> 38:27.100
I probably don't mean to say you know how to be done you can just go over there

38:27.100 --> 38:29.940
They're good for everybody it really are all right

38:29.940 --> 38:36.660
So I guess what 2015 just around the corner Matt you and I made our predictions right over the cuff on Sunday show

38:37.220 --> 38:41.100
But we haven't I've been looking forward to hearing what the Bumble room has I?

38:41.100 --> 38:45.660
I don't know exactly our best format for this because I know everybody has a lot of ideas so mumble room

38:45.660 --> 38:48.620
Why don't we use the you just ping me in the chat room like we normally do and?

38:49.340 --> 38:55.500
I'll start with I'll start with one, and then we'll just get things rolling okay, and chat room you bang suggest away

38:55.500 --> 38:58.940
That'll be your job, and here is my first

38:59.520 --> 39:02.940
2015 prediction hold on let me get the bell hold on okay

39:02.940 --> 39:10.760
High DPI support becomes a priority a top priority for at least one desktop project

39:12.320 --> 39:18.060
High DPI support because you're gonna you have things like the yoga the Macbook retina the 5k

39:18.060 --> 39:25.200
I Mac the 4k Dell display you're gonna have a ton of 4k at CES right CES is just around that's one of things

39:25.200 --> 39:28.080
We always have to remember when we do these predictions is we're doing them right before CES

39:28.080 --> 39:32.240
And that is where I think the for it's gonna be like a no-brainer you have to have high DPI

39:32.240 --> 39:37.860
I think you're gonna have a ton of Windows machines showing high DPI you got the whole Mac line going high DPI

39:38.040 --> 39:42.280
It's you're gonna have all these just like at one point boom secure boots here now

39:42.280 --> 39:47.600
We have to deal with secure boot high DPI is here in 2015 by the end of 2015. We've got it solved

39:47.600 --> 39:54.120
We're super close gnome has it very very close gnome is gorgeous on a high DPI display you open up an application

39:54.120 --> 40:00.440
It totally falls apart, so there's got it like there's a big gap still and it's not it's not I

40:00.440 --> 40:05.660
I wouldn't even say it's 80, but it's like 80 80 ish. It's not 85. It's definitely not 90

40:05.660 --> 40:11.880
It's it's it's close, and I think we can close the gap in 2015 that right there is my prediction wimpy

40:11.880 --> 40:14.280
I know you have something around these lines go

40:15.160 --> 40:19.200
No, I was just querying whether high DPI had actually happened this year with

40:19.880 --> 40:25.200
Gnome 3 I don't think so push on a high DPI cinnamon elementary does it does it?

40:25.200 --> 40:27.640
I don't think it counts if like is

40:27.640 --> 40:32.560
We know don't call it the chrome, but you know the frame around your screen if that's high DPI

40:32.560 --> 40:37.080
But every single thing you do on it is not high DPI. That's not high DPI support. That's like

40:38.160 --> 40:40.160
Yeah, yeah

40:43.320 --> 40:48.180
So catching up with with Apple basically maybe and also I think Windows

40:48.180 --> 40:52.680
I think Windows 10 is gonna be it's gonna be a big thing is gonna be showing off at CAS. I suspect

40:52.680 --> 40:58.820
Oh, uh poppy. Do you have any Ubuntu? Maybe unity 8 related prediction?

41:00.840 --> 41:03.700
Yeah, okay a couple I think

41:05.280 --> 41:07.680
2015 with the yearable two switches to a rolling release

41:13.760 --> 41:20.800
Is this a buntu snappy core kind of rolling release or is this more like repos and I'm app dist updating

41:20.800 --> 41:22.800
all the time I

41:24.040 --> 41:32.400
Don't know. I'm not sure. I think both potentially, you know, both could happen. I'd like to see the ability for you to

41:33.520 --> 41:36.000
Separate out the applications from the underlying

41:36.280 --> 41:42.080
platform and not have to worry about the underlying platform and not and get your applications delivered whether they're clicks or

41:42.680 --> 41:48.600
Snappy or Debian packages, whatever. I would just like you to just keep rolling. Okay. All right

41:48.600 --> 41:51.280
so poppy I think with regards to like

41:52.000 --> 41:57.360
Snappy and click packages and having a base on which those applications are installed

41:58.720 --> 42:02.080
That's potentially possible to roll in that model

42:02.080 --> 42:09.280
But I can't see any way Ubuntu is going to enter a rolling model with its Debian packaging

42:09.280 --> 42:11.280
Not this year. No way

42:11.280 --> 42:17.200
Hmm, well, let's see. Yeah, I I tell you what

42:19.560 --> 42:21.760
Pants on my head at the end of 2015

42:22.560 --> 42:28.180
Ubuntu goes to a rolling release model on the traditional on the traditional Debian package

42:30.360 --> 42:36.560
The pants wager has been made the end of 2015 wimpy will wear his pants on his head if Ubuntu does not

42:36.560 --> 42:40.680
Or does I'm sorry if Ubuntu does go rolling. It does go rolling

42:41.680 --> 42:48.280
This is outside of snappy and click packages because on that model it could work but on the on the on the traditional model

42:48.280 --> 42:53.960
No way, and to be clear, you know, I still I still think it could work even with Debian packages

42:55.960 --> 42:58.300
That's effectively what we're doing right now with

42:58.300 --> 43:05.980
When you run the development release, you know, you're effectively run the development release and then every six months take snapshot do QA release it

43:05.980 --> 43:11.580
and then everyone else just carries on but the thing is is that your upstream is Debian and

43:12.220 --> 43:18.980
Ubuntu don't pull everything in that comes from Debian because you've so heavily patched an s-ton of stuff that you you

43:19.460 --> 43:25.580
Have to block things and that then prevents other packages being pulled in because that's dependency breakage

43:25.580 --> 43:28.500
You would have to sink against Debian

43:30.300 --> 43:32.300
Absolutely

43:33.660 --> 43:36.540
Well, hang on if we're sinking from

43:37.660 --> 43:40.020
Unstable not not testing not

43:40.980 --> 43:43.260
Have a gigantic. Yeah, sure

43:43.260 --> 43:49.780
But but you don't know rolling doesn't mean you have to have bleeding edge of everything rolling just means it's rolling and you'll get continuous updates

43:49.780 --> 43:52.820
It doesn't mean yeah Debian experimental

43:52.820 --> 43:57.500
Yeah, you're saying you're saying it's rolling as far as Ubuntu could do it

43:57.500 --> 44:00.940
So as pack as the Ubuntu project is ready to push out a package, they push it

44:01.500 --> 44:06.460
But even so I've I've experience of this of working with a truly rolling release

44:06.980 --> 44:08.180
distribution and

44:08.180 --> 44:16.060
Understanding how you have to orchestrate the changes when there's an SO bump in something and doing that in Ubuntu with all of the patching

44:16.060 --> 44:18.060
It's just gonna be a colossal nightmare

44:18.060 --> 44:23.540
Really if a bun to pull it off brilliant, I will wear my pants on my head, but I I think with your

44:24.060 --> 44:29.900
Focus on phones and all the other stuff you're doing trying to push to a rolling release model is is gonna be

44:30.300 --> 44:34.540
Massive burnout and hugely frustrating for everyone that's involved. Hmm

44:35.660 --> 44:38.180
To a very opposing predictions poppy

44:38.180 --> 44:44.860
You don't have to accept the pants challenge if you don't want you're already in pants debt. So I I am I am down one pants

44:44.860 --> 44:48.700
Debt. Yeah, I have another one. Okay. Go ahead. This one

44:49.980 --> 44:55.420
Little bit curable. I predict that in 2015 Amazon will buy canonical

44:56.900 --> 45:00.660
Whoa, that's a that's a mind job. What?

45:01.780 --> 45:06.260
Yeah, and that actually isn't implausible when you stop and think about it. I

45:07.260 --> 45:11.980
Mean it does kind of make sense. Look at the direction. Oh my god. It does right easy

45:11.980 --> 45:17.220
Look at the field mobile product that didn't work out because honestly they were trying to use a Google thing on it

45:17.220 --> 45:19.220
And I mean, yeah, I mean it adds up. It's

45:19.740 --> 45:22.020
All this and it gives them the desktop and server

45:22.020 --> 45:27.540
Oh wow, a boon to touch would be a excellent platform from the for them to deliver a bunch of prime stuff

45:27.540 --> 45:33.380
They could bring that in they are AC to its ammo. It's our ability is already all over easy to yep

45:33.700 --> 45:39.100
You got it. We would want to own like like one of the biggest technologies on their own cloud platform

45:39.100 --> 45:41.100
It makes sense

45:41.620 --> 45:46.020
If we're doing troll predictions, I'll go ahead and say that arch is gonna have a snapshot LTS version

45:50.860 --> 45:58.020
Wow, I think I just to be clear, I don't think either no troll, but no, I know the Amazon thing has some validity to it

45:58.020 --> 46:03.540
If you really look at one factor, yeah, that's you just blew my mind Poby and I like it a lot. You're welcome

46:03.540 --> 46:05.540
That's a good one. I never would have come up with

46:05.540 --> 46:12.780
Amazon would buy canonical I would switch distributions and buy some stock in Amazon because I think it's a smart business move

46:12.780 --> 46:17.780
But yeah, I'm going to destroy. Yeah, you know what in a way it would I would seriously be one of the smartest business moves

46:17.780 --> 46:23.540
I've ever seen Amazon make it will make sense. I mean if they mount their their phone was successful, which it was not

46:23.540 --> 46:28.700
Yeah, maybe not but because of that failure. I think that shows them. You know what? We really need

46:29.380 --> 46:31.420
Someone to come in and you know fix our bridges

46:31.420 --> 46:36.660
Essentially Wow, huh, but would mark do it poppy? I don't know. That's

46:37.660 --> 46:42.540
This is just a wild. Yeah stab in the dark. I don't have any inside knowledge. I don't know of any

46:43.180 --> 46:47.300
Plans in this direction or discuss the only way I could see the only way I could see it happening

46:47.300 --> 46:53.500
Is like if it like if it enabled some kind of big vision or goal like if it like if at the end of the day

46:53.500 --> 46:57.340
Like it was uh, it was it was maybe sudden injection of cash

46:57.340 --> 47:02.340
You remember it wouldn't have to be like a full-on takeover, right? It could be more like a Zappos purchase

47:03.340 --> 47:07.340
Where like they get some money, but Zappos keeps it weird, too. Yep. All right

47:07.340 --> 47:11.340
So I said Amazon will buy canonical, but I'm willing to accept any kind of you know

47:12.340 --> 47:14.340
anything where they give us a

47:15.340 --> 47:20.340
Crap ton of money and you know, we brand something Amazon thing

47:20.340 --> 47:27.340
I'll accept that you're giving an Amazon a lot of credit but you know the thing is is the thing that would put a buntu in

47:27.340 --> 47:31.340
Front of them right would be competition in the mobile space, but also just watching ec2. I

47:32.340 --> 47:39.340
Mean they could they might want to do that just because of ec2 let alone the mobile stuff and all that Wow. All right. Okay, that's

47:40.340 --> 47:46.340
Yikes, all right. So I let's let's make a big gearshift here Keller. I love your presentation

47:46.340 --> 47:49.340
You think to have one huge success in 2015. What do you think?

47:50.340 --> 47:53.340
I think far from a success one. You've got a

47:54.340 --> 48:00.340
You get it's very little out of the project to I think everybody is looking forward to the future

48:00.340 --> 48:06.340
I mean it's a backstep and I don't think it's a backstep that everybody is going to be willing to adopt

48:06.340 --> 48:12.340
Mmm. Yeah, I think it'll be a lot of talk. But what do you guys think about the whole systemd controversy?

48:12.340 --> 48:16.340
Is it is it played out? I think dev1 will collapse

48:17.340 --> 48:21.340
It will just just fall apart. They're just gonna take their money and have

48:22.340 --> 48:28.340
Go at it in the Christmas sales you think or you think they're just gonna maybe not eat or you just it'll be like a it'll

48:28.340 --> 48:33.340
Be it. Well, let's shift our expectations and we're just gonna keep plugging away at it and it'll become like

48:34.340 --> 48:37.340
Like her there'll be like two guys left running it and it will

48:37.340 --> 48:43.340
Take forever and nothing will happen. Hope you there is two guys running it two guys from Italy that I've got no experience in

48:44.340 --> 48:46.340
Running a Debbie and derivative. So

48:50.340 --> 48:57.340
So does that mean does the systemd stuff kind of die out with them or does this debate continue on I think everyone

48:58.340 --> 49:03.340
Accepts pretty much everyone outside that circle of tinfoil hat systemd

49:03.340 --> 49:10.340
Haters everyone outside that circle is accepting that this is a way forward for Linux, you know, even us, you know, yeah

49:11.340 --> 49:17.340
It makes sense. Why why have this fragmentation or why have this backward step? It makes no sense

49:17.340 --> 49:18.340
Well, it was interesting

49:18.340 --> 49:23.340
I thought one of the people that kind of just sort of put it in the best soundbite possible is Mark Shuttleworth when he you know

49:23.340 --> 49:28.340
When I when I asked him about the you know, why did why systemd like I said, I asked him

49:28.340 --> 49:34.340
I said how can you make the logical justification that you got to go with systemd because everybody else is going with systemd

49:34.340 --> 49:37.340
But yet you can go mere and I thought he did a pretty good job of saying well

49:37.340 --> 49:43.340
Look, this is this reason this is that reason and he kind of just put the whole thing in like basically a 30-second soundbite

49:44.340 --> 49:46.340
Which was good. He's quite good at that. Yeah

49:47.340 --> 49:51.340
So let's talk about I said telegram and I know it's a d-bag thing to say

49:51.340 --> 49:54.340
But I said telegram was a post Snowden product

49:54.340 --> 50:02.340
I think also some of this stepped-up security audits. We've seen Red Hat and Google have done a ton of auditing of like open SSL

50:02.340 --> 50:06.340
And stuff like that. We saw shell shock and we saw heart bleed this year

50:06.340 --> 50:10.340
I I feel like one of the things is people realize oh crap

50:10.340 --> 50:13.340
We've all been talking about open source code being open

50:13.340 --> 50:19.340
But none of us have really been checking it and then like some some some even groups formed up to go check the code and like

50:19.340 --> 50:25.340
Some commercial ones and some private ones and so we got a lot of stuff discovered this year. Are we done?

50:25.340 --> 50:30.340
Are we through it is 2015 gonna be a ton of more security issues? What do you think Matt? I

50:31.340 --> 50:32.340
think that

50:32.340 --> 50:34.340
No, I don't think there'll be a ton of new security issues

50:34.340 --> 50:40.340
But I do think there's some stuff that we probably haven't really addressed by and large just in the brick-and-mortar world

50:40.340 --> 50:44.340
We really haven't done squat other than react when it comes to POS

50:44.340 --> 50:50.340
Systems and things like that banking networks, you know, just infrastructure stuff in general. I think there's so much

50:50.340 --> 50:52.340
I don't know less

50:52.340 --> 50:57.340
Newsworthy stuff that hasn't been touched on yet that we're probably still yet to experience some unfortunate stuff

50:57.340 --> 51:00.340
Do you think Linux will take a few more bruises over 2015?

51:00.340 --> 51:04.340
I think that it will I think it will be forced to be vetted a little harder

51:04.340 --> 51:07.340
I think that it will actually become

51:07.340 --> 51:10.340
The actually of the opposite of that I would say that it's going to be a little bit harder

51:10.340 --> 51:16.340
It will actually become the actually of the opposite of that I would say that you're gonna probably see more switching to Linux because of

51:16.340 --> 51:19.340
The fact that the existing systems a lot of them incredibly dated

51:19.340 --> 51:21.340
We'll be switching that direction

51:21.340 --> 51:27.340
But then because of that then the focus will be even deeper on Linux because of that point. Yeah very much so I would imagine

51:28.340 --> 51:34.340
That that actually lends itself to some other things that I think will happen this year. Yeah is more

51:34.340 --> 51:38.340
Devices and more software will ship with encryption

51:38.340 --> 51:42.340
Yeah, by default. Yeah, great. Yeah, I could definitely agree

51:42.340 --> 51:48.340
And you could even maybe see carriers like I could even be something like T-Mobile carrier of encryption or something

51:48.340 --> 51:51.340
Wimpy you had a thought on security and privacy breaches

51:52.340 --> 51:54.340
Yeah, so

51:54.340 --> 51:56.340
What poppies Mike?

51:56.340 --> 51:59.340
There you go. He got it. My predictions

52:00.340 --> 52:01.340
historically

52:01.340 --> 52:03.340
terrible

52:03.340 --> 52:05.340
so

52:05.340 --> 52:12.340
Exactly the opposite of anything I predict this evening is likely to happen, but I think that a major cloud service

52:12.340 --> 52:17.340
So something like Twitter Facebook Google Dropbox eBay Amazon

52:17.340 --> 52:22.340
Mm-hmm. They'll suffer a significant privacy or security breach in 2015

52:22.340 --> 52:26.540
Yeah, that will change precisely nothing for the average users. I

52:28.040 --> 52:32.060
Think 2015 will see the passage of sis, but we won't call it sis

52:32.060 --> 52:37.740
But but there's already the they're always in the wake of the Sony thing. I've been tracking it for unfiltered

52:37.740 --> 52:40.840
There is already legislation working its way through the system today

52:41.440 --> 52:46.840
President Obama has already called for legislation and it will be a cyber sharing act

52:47.020 --> 52:51.340
It'll be the government needs to share with the private industry and that'll be how it's pitched

52:51.340 --> 52:58.180
There's too many cyber vulnerabilities that the government knows about they have all this advanced monitoring all of this know-how because they're cyber warriors

52:58.180 --> 53:03.060
But it's the dumb industry the dumb private sector doesn't know about it. So we can't share with them cuz of laws guys

53:03.140 --> 53:06.460
So if we pass these laws then we can share the super cyber information

53:06.820 --> 53:10.980
What it really is it'll be the same thing that happened during the Bush era during the Bush era

53:10.980 --> 53:15.420
We indemnified all the telcos to allow us to install of the NSA taps. This is the same thing

53:15.420 --> 53:17.820
This is gonna be tech company indemnification

53:17.820 --> 53:21.820
You got to be part of the big boy club to get in but you'll be in and they'll do some sort of

53:21.820 --> 53:28.960
Cyber security information sharing after exactly the kind of event that wimpy is talking about the only reason why I say that is because

53:28.960 --> 53:31.600
There's literally already legislation ready to go

53:32.060 --> 53:37.740
Just needing an event to happen and it just takes an opportunity and it's done and we'll look at it as sort of like

53:37.740 --> 53:38.900
Oh now hopefully they'll work together

53:38.900 --> 53:44.780
But in reality, it's just gonna be capitalizing on exactly what wimpy is talking about nothing to really change for the end-user

53:44.780 --> 53:51.600
I think to 2015 is gonna be like 2014 was boy. They're really figured out like cyber boy

53:51.600 --> 53:56.780
We really ended the year with a cyber boogeyman. So going into 2015 that's gonna be a good one

53:56.780 --> 53:58.780
And I I think you've nailed it wimpy

53:59.220 --> 54:01.140
Unfortunately, I'm a bit of I know that sounds awful

54:01.140 --> 54:05.480
I'm a con you have a thought about point-of-sale systems under constant attack over 2015

54:07.500 --> 54:12.220
I'm a con. No. Okay. Well, I think that one's going twice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There you go

54:12.220 --> 54:16.200
I guess that was kind of his thought is I and that's something we followed a lot in tech snap is the point-of-sale

54:16.200 --> 54:19.920
Devices a lot of them still XP. So hopefully we'll get that sorted out

54:19.920 --> 54:25.320
Well, and even someone is not, you know, someone like myself who's by no means an expert in any capacity in that area

54:25.320 --> 54:30.700
I would just looking at it. I'm looking at the reaction to it and the lack of anything happening. I find that interesting

54:31.020 --> 54:35.340
Hmm, let's wave our arms around a lot and scream and yell and put it in the news and then we'll go back to business

54:35.340 --> 54:37.340
As usual. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I'm coming

54:38.260 --> 54:44.460
Never mind wimpy. Let's you know what? I like the way you're I like the way you're thinking. Let's stop talking about the negative stuff

54:44.460 --> 54:50.620
Let's talk about VR. I've got an oculus right here. I'm looking at it. What are your predictions for 2015 and virtual reality?

54:51.220 --> 54:53.220
You're not gonna like it

54:55.860 --> 55:02.160
Prediction is the VR will continue to lack adoption in 2015 and I cite the

55:03.740 --> 55:06.380
Adoption of 3d televisions as reference

55:07.020 --> 55:12.520
For that prediction. I think VR is not going to penetrate the consumer market

55:12.520 --> 55:17.080
at all if ever and it will be the preserve of

55:18.360 --> 55:20.360
commercial applications such as

55:21.200 --> 55:25.360
Digital surgery and things of that nature now, have you ever used an oculus?

55:26.200 --> 55:32.040
Nope. Hmm. Like I said everything I say this evening is probably going to be completely wrong, but

55:34.120 --> 55:39.080
No, if you're just talking 2015, I think I would agree with you I just I think the cost is still too high

55:39.080 --> 55:45.880
You know what the the over 2014 we talked about it on tech talk and it's really gone nowhere on tech talk today though

55:45.880 --> 55:49.920
We covered Samsung's attempt. They licensed oculus VR

55:50.720 --> 55:53.320
technology and they created about a

55:53.800 --> 55:55.640
$100 $200

55:55.640 --> 55:57.960
VR kit that's totally wireless

55:58.560 --> 56:05.240
Which is good and bad, but it's totally wireless you put on your head it also though it requires a note 3

56:05.240 --> 56:09.640
Specifically a note 3 and that's like a you get that unlock. That's like a $700 smartphone

56:10.680 --> 56:16.960
So that's just the cost is way to the oculus dk2. It's totally not ready for average consumers

56:17.040 --> 56:23.280
You know, you got four wires hanging off that thing. You got you got a monkey with your video settings like like an animal

56:23.280 --> 56:24.880
It's just ridiculous

56:24.880 --> 56:29.560
But wimpy I got to tell you a I feel like in my life

56:29.560 --> 56:34.520
I there has been a handful of moments where I have seen a

56:34.760 --> 56:39.080
Technology before I feel like everybody else has seen it and I've gone this is gonna change everything

56:40.120 --> 56:43.560
like this is huge and I feel like when I put

56:44.120 --> 56:52.100
When I put that oculus VR headset on and I put headphones on and I I was on a raft in the middle of the ocean

56:52.800 --> 56:59.080
It was it was tranquil as hell. Like it was super tranquil. Like I was so peaceful

56:59.080 --> 57:01.800
It was ridiculous and I'm like, this is amazing

57:01.800 --> 57:07.400
I am standing in my studio right now, but my whole body thinks I am on a

57:07.720 --> 57:09.720
raft in the middle of the ocean

57:09.720 --> 57:16.840
Chillin and I seriously had a moment and I just think that if other people could experience that it's nothing like 3d

57:16.840 --> 57:20.520
It's nothing like 3d, but you've got to make the picture better right now right now

57:20.520 --> 57:22.880
The GPUs aren't powerful enough and the gear is too expensive

57:22.880 --> 57:30.360
I think no point about experience is the key point is that you want to experience these things with other people

57:30.440 --> 57:38.080
And the problem with 3d televisions is that experiencing 3d TV with other people is difficult and expensive

57:38.360 --> 57:40.440
Yeah, and the same applies to VR

57:41.720 --> 57:43.760
experiencing VR with other people is

57:44.640 --> 57:50.440
difficult and expensive and I think these are the reasons why it won't be a mass

57:50.440 --> 57:53.200
It's difficult and expensive in person

57:53.280 --> 57:58.040
But it's the exact opposite for a remote experience imagine Skype oculus VR style

57:58.160 --> 58:03.760
Then it's amazing because you can be in if you can be in a 3d space and you and I could be looking at each

58:03.760 --> 58:06.320
Other right now and that you know that

58:06.840 --> 58:13.600
That you just think about how that could impact podcasting like we it future versions of you know, Linux unplugged episode

58:13.880 --> 58:17.320
2000 we could all be sitting at a virtual roundtable having this conversation

58:17.320 --> 58:21.440
Holodeck. Yeah, I don't know. Well, I think

58:22.200 --> 58:25.800
The new VR space is missing two things

58:26.480 --> 58:28.920
One is a good input device

58:29.400 --> 58:35.040
The keyboard doesn't really work when your eyes are covered with you know, this display

58:35.840 --> 58:41.480
there's some really cool new things being developed and worked on and I think

58:42.080 --> 58:46.920
Like I'm hoping that something really cool is going to come out in 2015

58:46.920 --> 58:52.560
And then all once that's done and there's some nice comfortable

58:53.080 --> 58:59.400
Input device for VR. All we need is in killer app. Yeah, maybe you know, well

59:01.000 --> 59:05.520
The killer app for previous technologies that have had this problem this this barrier is

59:05.520 --> 59:16.600
Basically porn that's the killer app that has accelerated HD streaming. Hold on. Do we have a prediction? Do we have a prediction?

59:16.600 --> 59:22.280
Well two related to that one would be I think the opposite of wimpy

59:22.280 --> 59:28.280
I think VR will take off but it will be the low-end Google cardboard style

59:28.280 --> 59:34.640
Yeah, and I think that will take off dramatically this year. Yeah, which will push the higher-end stuff

59:34.640 --> 59:41.840
Maybe the year after or the year after that, but I think once porn gets into VR then you'll see a massive up

59:41.840 --> 59:43.160
I'm not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie

59:43.160 --> 59:46.800
If you came to me and said there was a really good porn app for the oculus just out of journalistic

59:47.400 --> 59:49.480
Interest I would have to check that out so I can report back

59:56.920 --> 01:00:03.600
Video online and it shows up they have a 3d player that if you have an oculus or the Google

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:08.240
Cardboard you can watch video online in 3d. All right

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.980
Yeah, yeah, you would yeah, I do agree on it. It looks like I think

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.120
Keller also agrees

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.000
I look at it

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.220
And I think one thing I'm happy about this at this point in 2014 is you guys know?

01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:26.060
I was pretty I was pretty ticked off that I bought the oculus SDK

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.800
Being told I would have Linux support and then it got here and it took a month

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:34.720
But now the Linux support is here now go figure now the Linux support here is here

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:35.800
I have three monitors hooked up

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:41.360
I don't have any more room, but I'm gonna hand it over to a chase is gonna be experimenting with it and reporting back soon

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:47.320
I have another I have another a prediction. I want to make and I want to get everybody's take on this I

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:53.480
Think over 2015 we're gonna see a fork of the elementary OS project. I think people like the idea

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:57.920
They like the look of it, but it's moving too slow and people want something faster

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:03.520
I think because we're geeks we're nerds, and I think maybe it'll either be an internal division of the project

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.920
Which if that happens?

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:11.880
They're tight control. Why not? I disagree. Why not just people contribute to elementary I

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.240
Wish man, I wish

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.680
Contributions will be added in two years. Yeah

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.680
Might not be fast enough for them. So yeah, that's what I'm thinking to achieve that level of

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.520
unification

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.840
that

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:31.960
Elementary has you need that slow development process. I agree a new app

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:39.200
Pops up. Yep. It takes a while to refine all the UI elements. Yeah, so it feels

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:47.040
Comfortable within the ecosystem of that. Oh, yeah over elementary. So that's no development is the result of

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:54.480
Other priorities that elementary developers have and this is not going to go away with a fork

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:59.960
Mm-hmm. Well, no, no it will it will and that fork won't have some of those same values

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:03.460
And that's the very reason why the fork will have a small following but not be as successful

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:09.400
Elementary OS is slowness is actually in a sense what makes a difference, but I think that's a dream

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:15.400
I just don't think the the the average Linux user base is using Linux because they want a slow stale

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:18.760
Experience they want something new they wanted that new code

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.300
They don't have to doesn't have to be super cutting but you know

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:25.680
Maybe more than a year old would be good. And so anything that falls below that I think

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.320
are

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.440
Linux distros that are Ubuntu based and

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.960
So look good and want to have like somewhat unified look to all the applications

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:42.240
But update faster, there's no need to for just switch to a different distro. Oh, hey, man

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:46.400
I'm just don't tell me tell the dev one guys. I mean, I'm not the place saying logic applies

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.440
I just think it might happen over 2015

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.640
I wouldn't be so I'm not making a I'm not gonna make a pants bet over this one

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:55.680
You know what? I got a prediction. I can make a pants bet about though

01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:00.280
I'll be willing to make a pants bet about this. Okay. All right. You know what? Okay. Okay. Hold on

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.280
I got a ding. I got a thing for the

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:06.840
Pants over here. Yeah. All right. That's the ding for the elementary OS fork prediction. I'm trying to ding

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.000
I maybe I'll find them in editing

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.520
I don't know later on so that we want to go play these back because we all will have to

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:17.120
Count for our predictions. All right, so I my next prediction

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:21.600
I'm willing to go on the record and make a pants bet about if I get this wrong

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:28.520
For at least an entire segment of last I will wear my pants on my head. Okay, I don't know when I get

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:31.080
Chatterum will have to set the date

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:38.600
Well, I do I was thinking us pants would be very funny because then I have to deal with like these long-ass pants

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:41.640
But if I mean there's room for negotiation

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:48.840
Negotiation what we'll negotiate, but first I'm gonna tell you about Linux Academy Linux Academy comms. That's right

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.700
I'm telling you about Linux Academy right now Linux Academy comm

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:57.680
Unplugged to get you our special 33% discount go over there and check them out. I know

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:03.400
You're expecting me to talk about New Year's resolutions right now and give you a hard time about

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.920
How you always want to do something over the New Year's and how you want to get your skills

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.320
I'm not gonna do that because I think you could use Linux Academy anytime

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:14.540
I don't think it needs to be New Year's. I think sometimes that gets us to think about these kinds of things

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:20.760
But truthfully I think we've all been thinking about a way to keep our skill set up a way to check out new

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Technologies without having to go through the entire implementation stack and being guided by experts

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
I think we've all thought about that from time to time

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.920
Linux Academy is a unique opportunity. First of all

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:35.160
They're sponsors and you can support our show by checking out our sponsors go to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:39.360
But second of all and I think this is actually probably the more and more probably should so this one first

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:42.960
But I'm selfish. It's it's content created by people that

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:49.520
Genuinely give a shit about this right? They care about Linux. They care about open stack. They care about all of this

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:57.320
Fundamental things that they're teaching you about unlike all the other online education systems that are these one size fits all come in

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.800
We'll teach you all of these subjects because we bring in all these it's crap

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.000
That's not how it works

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.620
You start with a core group of people that really care about Linux and open source and people that are genuine

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:12.980
Educators that want to spread information and then people that know how to build all of us and people that know how to create

01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:16.260
Livestreams and websites and do the coding you bring them all together

01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:22.180
The sys out even it's great because it's like there's a sys admin element because they have they have labs that autospin up you bring

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:25.860
Them all together and that that rare thing is Linux Academy

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.740
You just do not get

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:35.740
This kind of accumulation of all of this talent in one place too often and it's Linux Academy go to Linux Academy comm slash unplug

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:41.500
You'll get step-by-step video courses downloadable comprehensive study guides your courseware comes with its own server

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.020
So as you get to a point in the lab, they spin up a server for you

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:47.420
It's on AWS don't matter you pick from seven plus links distributions

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:50.900
They'll automatically adjust the courseware to match the Linux distro

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:55.460
If you're hopping around distros like Popey is you don't have to care you just feel good

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:59.820
You know when you choose the fedora stuff and automatically adjust all the courseware to match fedora

01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:04.060
They're honey badger about that kind of stuff and you get to keep your progress right in check as you go

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:07.900
So, you know right where you're at how long something's gonna take they got learning plans, too

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:12.840
You're busy. You don't know busy, but I know busy and let me tell you I still make Linux Academy work

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:16.820
I go into Linux Academy. I have a learning plan. I say Linux Academy. I got this much time available

01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:19.800
I want to learn something. They'll automatically they're

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:24.540
Dynamically generate a courseware for you with little bits of here's where this how long is gonna take you

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:30.460
They'll send you reminders about quizzes. You can download mp3s. You can check out the live streams of the courseware

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:31.900
You can ask questions of the educators

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:37.740
They have a community where you can go participate and give you that bump when you fall behind and they're always adding new content

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:39.780
puppet Docker

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:47.460
Vagrant open stack constantly adding new content Linux Academy comm slash unplugged go check them out get the 33% discount

01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:53.060
I'm really excited about Linux Academy because I think this kind of niche focus on the technologies

01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:54.940
It's super kick-ass that we all care about

01:06:54.940 --> 01:07:00.660
That's what it takes to make money making that difference is what it takes and that's what Linux Academy is all about Linux Academy

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:06.860
Comm slash unplug go check them out and a big thank you links Academy for sponsoring the Linux unplugged program

01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:12.780
I have been a member the entire time that they have been a sponsor and I'm always checking out their new stuff

01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:16.500
All right. So continuing on with our 2015 predictions. I

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:21.340
Last year when I was reviewing the Linux action shows prediction for 2014

01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:27.000
There was one topic that obviously was dominating our mindset and that was steam and steam machines

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:33.100
It was all about what's valve gonna do. It's gonna change everything steam games. Oh my gosh, they're gonna come to Linux

01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:35.100
So I'm gonna make

01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:37.860
My steam machine prediction right here

01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:44.740
now it's hard to say because valve has already said no steam machine business at CES and

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.340
So that to me was like, oh

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:51.300
They're not ready to show us anything. Okay

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:56.820
They're not ready to show steam machines at CES. That's probably a bad sign. Plus nothing ever shipped this year

01:07:56.820 --> 01:08:02.340
Really? We never really I mean one thing that shipped right was that was the Alienware thing that runs windows

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:08.020
So we remember how we predicted that would go yeah, yes, we were correct

01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:12.860
Here's my prediction convention though. It yes exactly

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:20.360
Exactly. What's that called? I'm pretty I'm for blanking. Yeah, those GDC and G and e3 both of them

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:27.040
Yeah our prime opportunities for a steam machine to be released and I think by the time we were doing this episode in

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.260
2015 I think there will be a steam machine on the market that we can buy

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:32.540
I don't know

01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:36.380
I cannot predict what its success is gonna be because there's so many variables involved there

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:43.520
But I do want to go out on a limb and say end of 2015 a steam machine that we are at least perhaps

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:47.020
Somewhat compromising but happy with and if that doesn't happen

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:50.240
By January, I'll wear pants on my head

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:55.920
Well, Doug Lombardi said valve is planning a large steam machine presence for GDC

01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:59.460
2015 which is in March so it could well happen

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:03.580
yeah, the thing is and I didn't know that but the thing is that I

01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:09.420
Presence well, that doesn't mean much because we've actually had a steam machine presence a year ago

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:11.500
Like we've seen steam machines before

01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:18.060
The scene a steam machine and then having maybe potentially millions of them in people's living rooms are really two different things

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:21.480
I'm not saying millions, but I'm saying it's a it's available for purchase

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:25.380
Since then the OS has had a lot more of a workout and they've been doing

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:30.340
Delivering updates and getting used to delivering updates and more and more games are available

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:37.060
I think something like seven of the top ten games on Steam have Linux. Yeah versions available

01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:41.260
Yeah, something like that. Yeah, so it I mean even by then it'll be even higher

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:46.680
So I I maybe it just market wasn't ready for it last year, but it maybe is this year

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:50.020
I I reckon by the end of the year. There will be steam machines on market

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:56.980
Keller so I look at the price and I think by the time that steam machines hit the market the ps4 and the Xbox one

01:09:56.980 --> 01:10:01.780
We'll probably have gone through at least one maybe two more pricing revisions. What do you think about the price Keller? I

01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:04.340
mean if you can get

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:06.680
decent hardware at a lower price and what your

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:12.760
Good console our show built the library. You have a good chance to to gain the users

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:19.360
For the Christmas season, but they're gonna have they right now you're going to that transistor phase building at the library

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:27.160
Now thing like I said again if you can just get the cost of hardware down to where it's below the Xbox or the ps4

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:32.560
We can do it. That would be a slam dunk and it's got a good name recognition already

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:37.320
So they give is really about the price. I agree. All right, so that's my steam machine

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.320
prediction

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:46.480
MX or M Fox dog and Fox dog really to G's Fox. I know you have a prediction about digital production for 2015. What's that?

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.120
Well at the moment

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:56.400
Digital production on the Linux has gone in leaps and bounds like with editing and actual animation

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.440
So I believe that in 2015

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:03.040
Most production will be either Linux or you or

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.760
Apple based

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:09.920
Because apples are great for design because the high DPI

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:13.560
That's true

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:19.160
So with Linux and its graphics drivers going really well as well with CUDA and OCL

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.240
It's just becoming more and more

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:30.560
Efficient to do production work on a Linux box. Yeah, so I believe that the vast majority of

01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.960
Digital production will be in Linux space

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:37.680
I wouldn't be I wouldn't say the vast but I wouldn't be surprised to see more and more and we might not even hear a lot

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:41.640
About it. One of the things I've noticed in our production workflow here Jupiter broadcasting is

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.760
one of the heaviest editing shows

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:50.280
For Jupiter broadcasting is actually on filter which is a little bit of an understatement

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:55.520
But if you think about it, I'm filter show one show might have a hundred clips in it or 30 clips

01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:02.240
It there's a huge ass range and every single one of those clips is edited by hand by me and

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:07.080
2014 was the year where it became not only

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.880
Faster for me to do it under Linux, but I actually got more features

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:14.600
One of the things is we started adding more video clips to unfilter

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:21.920
And I have been editing all of those under Linux using a set of tools most of which I've shared over the year as app

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.920
picks in Linux action show and and that for me, I

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:29.080
Guess I need to back up because which got to understand is for me

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:33.280
It's always been this guilt like oh, I should be editing and producing under Linux

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.280
But oh my god, it takes so much time and oh my gosh, the tools are not there yet

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.560
It just drives me crazy

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:45.600
What I have now with these clips for unfilter is I've gone from that this this oh, what a burden

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:51.360
To man, you know what? It's faster. If I just do this under Linux, it's better

01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:57.080
The results are better when I do this under Linux. It is more efficient under Linux now

01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:01.880
That is not like see that's a big deal because it's not just like I can do the work under Linux

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:05.040
It's it turns out better when I do it under Linux

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:11.360
That is huge for media production for Linux. So if that continues on if that kind of you know, one by one the little tools

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.160
Right now it's it's small tools that I'm chaining together if that continues on that progress. Whoo

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.240
That's gonna be awesome

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:22.680
That'd be really great. I don't know. We'll see 2015. I think it's just gonna be a slow steady march

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.440
I don't think I'm not I don't think you make any big predictions there

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:30.760
So we kind of we've kicked around a bunt to touch a little bit

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:38.520
Anybody want to make any specific a bunt to touch predictions? We we suspect we'll see something from BQ in early 2015

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.760
Don't know who's gonna be able to get their hands on it, but probably a lot of us

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.520
No, what do you think

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:50.040
You think you know a major carrier you think it you think you know

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:54.400
If you think if you're on a major carrier, you'll be able to use a bunt to touch if you want to somehow

01:13:55.080 --> 01:14:00.480
So here's how I see the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.920
See the perfect storm playing out

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:08.000
If we can get a major carrier to hurt badly enough to where they're forced to pull their heads out of their butts and look for something

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.520
New yes, then I see a major carrier coming along and saying okay clearly we've Android it ourselves to death

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:15.440
We need to try something new fresh

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:20.440
tap into the army of people that are still rocking flip phones or people that maybe are

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:24.560
In the market to change their mobile operating system into something different

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:31.080
I think I think it's entirely possible the key is to which carrier that's gonna be and that's hard to say

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:39.080
Verizon's incredibly stubborn AT&T, you know, they're kind of head the clouds T-mobile, you know, they might it just it's really hard to say for sure

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:45.840
But I think it could happen but it will take that pain point. Hmm. Yeah, I would like to just I guess what I'm looking for is

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:54.200
Yeah, I guess it seems to bet the better approach would be then over 2015 is devices carriers have already blessed and then you've reflashed

01:14:54.200 --> 01:15:00.720
Yeah, right now that could happen too. I mean it's but as far as any carrier embracement they need pain points or they don't care

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:06.400
It's either dollar signs or others hurts. How do you think? Okay. All right. How you feeling about Firefox OS any different? I

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:09.700
think that's got a real chance of

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:16.120
Seeing adoption in areas that have not really had a lot of sense of smartphones before I don't know

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:20.920
I see them like on eBay and stuff like this and it's like they're really approachable unlocked price-wise

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:27.600
I honestly think that someone got there got themselves together and actually gathered up a bunch of these and just started popping them into kiosk

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:32.640
Somewhere they would sell these all day long. I really believe that yeah, and I think a bone two phones could do the same thing

01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.280
But again, it's its presence its presence. Hmm

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:42.600
Yeah, I I find it interesting that I felt like I was more confident to make predictions about Ubuntu touch at the end of

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:47.640
Last year than I am of this year. Yeah, just a lot of unknowns. I mean, it's a great it's a great option

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:52.120
It's a great idea, but people need to touch and feel things. They need tactile experience

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:58.000
That needs to happen. Yeah, this year was hard this year. I really struggled with Android

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:05.080
I think this I think 2014 became a year where for me I I became a disenfranchised Android user

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:07.640
I still have my Nexus 5 I'd say Android is

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:13.840
70% of the operating system to runtime like 70% of my time in an OS is Android

01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:18.880
I I now fluctuate between Ubuntu touch and selfish OS and Firefox OS

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:25.880
But I I just I can't get past the fact that at the end of the day I enjoy using iOS more

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:31.000
I think iOS is more performant. I think it's simpler for what I need to do

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.820
I just need a phone that does text messages and listens to podcasts. That's literally all I need a phone to do and so for me

01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:45.000
For me Firefox OS selfish OS and Ubuntu touch are very appealing because they essentially could very easily be able to satisfy those needs

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:50.720
Now it's funny because I'm also the same person where when I go somewhere my requirements for a smartphone

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.600
Totally change now all of a sudden needs to be ways right needs to be able to do

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.760
Yeah, so it's it's it's I find it

01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.320
That's what I like about the Nexus 5 is that right now I like when I become that person I

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:07.300
I can use Android and when I'm the guy that just needs to listen to stuff and do and make text messages

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:11.020
I can use a different OS, but I find none of them to be ideal at this point

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:16.100
Yeah, I think anything that it can embrace your existing ecosystem has an edge over the other true

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:20.500
Yeah, you know stuff, you know, obviously Android's the most likely to be embraced ecosystem

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:26.460
I think that's really the main piece of it for myself. I like to use apps just to run my apps so that I can manage

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:28.100
my apps I

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:32.980
Live in apps. I have everything. It's ridiculous when I came when I dropped iOS years ago. I

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:37.480
Don't know three four hundred dollars of crap. Yeah, I mean, you know, I lost a fortune

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:42.820
So I'm very sensitive to that ecosystem. Yep. Yep. Great point and that's a bigger deal than ever now and

01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:48.900
Wimpy we got to talk about I mean, I know this is this is a family-friendly podcast

01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:51.900
We got to talk about the c-word though convergence. What do you think?

01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:58.540
Well, I have a prediction about convergence and that's canonicals definition or Mark Shuttleworth's

01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:03.620
Definition of convergence. So right now I've got a Samsung note 2

01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:11.140
Which was issued by work and that's now two years old and it's up for renewal in terms of the hardware

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:17.420
There is nothing on the market today that is significantly better than this phone that I've got that's two years old

01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:22.620
Yep, you know the cameras have got slightly more megapixels. Yeah, there's a touch more RAM

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.220
There's a couple more cores on the processor

01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:31.660
But there's not much to compel me from a hardware point of view to change the device

01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:36.860
I feel the same way about my Nexus 5. I feel the same thing because I've got cyanogen on this phone

01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:42.340
You know from a software point of view. It's perfectly fine. This could this could march on for another year quite happily

01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:49.020
so my prediction about converge devices, and this is canonicals definition of convergence where your

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:57.820
Mobile phone could be your desktop PC is that this convergence story will be adopted by the big players on

01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:04.260
The Android platform and that convergence story of turn your phone into your desktop

01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:11.340
will drive the next generation of mobile specs on your phone with regards to CPU GPU RAM and

01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:17.220
Story now when you see this is it HTC's implementations Samsung's version of it like is it like yeah?

01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:23.380
Each each of the yeah, so the Samsung's HTC's will have their own. You know

01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:30.220
Adaption to what happens to your device when you hook it up to a keyboard mouse and and fixed display

01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:36.580
But they I think they're all going to move to that convergence story because the the

01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:43.500
Only way you can justify all this extra hardware is to make the extra hardware. Do something. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:49.340
I think I think this already like Google already started making significant

01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:57.740
Moves towards making this happen because as far as I've been able to figure out in the new material design

01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:00.900
Specifications or whatever you call it

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:07.460
They actually included something like Ubuntu has which allows the application to scale from

01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:11.620
easily scale from a phone-sized application to a

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:14.460
Full

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:20.140
69 screen type of application and still be usable. So they're making

01:20:21.660 --> 01:20:23.660
Moves in that direction. So

01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:39.660
As far as I can doubt that that might be a very correct prediction. Yeah, I think it makes a lot of sense too because I think over 2015 will be the year you see 64-bit processors hit all of the anything that's considered a modern smartphone over 2015 will point towards the end of 2015 will have to have 64-bit. I'll make that a prediction because that's gonna be a marketing thing, right? And once you start, why do you need 64-bit because you need more than 4 gigs of RAM and why do you need 4 gigs of RAM because you want to run desktop apps?

01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:59.220
It sounds horrible, I mean we all remember the A tricks, but I also had a client that would love this

01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:03.140
I can think of a specific person. He was a big hitter for a company and this would be perfect for him

01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:10.500
As long as it was rock-solid. Here's where I don't think it's gonna be rock-solid different implementations like Samsung's Sam Samsung's gonna do horrible at that, right?

01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:12.100
Yeah

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.920
HTC probably gonna do horrible at that and so maybe

01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:19.040
We'll look at this and go but you know who baked this in at the core level is Ubuntu touch

01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:22.300
Maybe that'll happen. Maybe not or what's gonna happen?

01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:24.300
more likely is

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:30.500
Apple will come along rip it all off get it right and then nobody will ever talk about anybody else but apples

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:33.420
I

01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:34.940
Can't see Apple doing it

01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:38.980
I'd be surprised if they do and I really hope I really hope that

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:42.580
canonical are in the right place at the right time with Ubuntu touch and

01:21:42.860 --> 01:21:48.100
the the devices with the specs actually actually deliver on this because

01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:50.780
for all the people that knock

01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:58.000
Canonical and Ubuntu touch this is proper Linux on a mobile device and we we should all be supporting that endeavor really

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.280
Yeah

01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:04.960
Hell yeah. Yeah, I think boy that's it. You know what? I think you nailed it

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.240
I think they're gonna have to use convergence and you know

01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.680
The other thing is they're gonna be you know, they're already looking around for ideas

01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:13.160
They're looking over at Mark Shallow Earth and they're thinking way that guy's saying something smart

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:15.960
We should grab that and they're gonna go do it. I think you nailed that

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:21.560
I'm gonna give that a double ding. All right Keller you want to close this out on the convergence topic with a thought about

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:23.280
thoughts about Intel

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.080
Well, I mean if her true convergence to happen

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:32.120
We can't have two separate processor lines to focus on arm versus your your eye

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:34.920
86

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:37.600
We're gonna have to find a way to get Intel

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:43.160
More integrated into the mobile space. Yeah, I mean they're fiercely working on that

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:46.240
But yeah, you're right that that you can already buy Intel

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
phones and tablets

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.320
Yeah, what's gonna run on how are they selling? I

01:22:53.200 --> 01:23:01.320
Mean, well, yeah, that's the other thing we you know canonical could make a platform and software that runs on both

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:05.200
I mean Android already does yeah, you shouldn't download the same Android app

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.300
I mean, they're their fat binary builds that have x86 code and um HF code inside

01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:14.160
But the same thing could happen for pure Linux like a bunty

01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:22.460
Yeah, you know and I wouldn't my 2015 another maybe just as my final 2015 prediction would be I don't think Intel is gonna make any

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:26.500
significant inroads in mobile because

01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:31.580
the reason why I think that is because I've been along I've been around longer than five years and

01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:37.860
Seriously, I've seen Intel talk about this since the 90s, right? If they've been it's just around the corner

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:43.500
It's just around the corner. It's then it's just it's always just around the corner with Intel when it comes to mobile

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:44.900
And I'm not trying to be this guy

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:50.340
But at the same time you're seeing some amazing ass come out of the arm shops. There is really gonna start kicking their ass

01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:56.260
You know you look at the performance some of the some of these high-end tablets coming out of Nvidia and coming and the new

01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:03.460
iPad to air like these things are crazy like six core GPUs and stuff like that like Intel wake the F up

01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:08.100
It's it's the ship is sailing so they've really got to double down and I think at the end of the day

01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:12.060
It's gonna be more solved like Popey saying by things like Dalvik or whatever the hell

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:14.520
It's gonna be at the time or QML or whatever the hell

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.900
It's gonna be it's gonna be more

01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:18.940
It's gonna be handled in the software side less on the processor side

01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:24.540
And so you'll have devices that are Intel you have it you'll have devices that are ARM. I've for two years

01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:28.020
I've been predicting the ARM desktop. I'm not gonna make it this year, but I'm surprised

01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:34.900
Well in interestingly the the Intel based tablets that are on the market at the moment were subsidized by Intel

01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:42.060
Yeah, they were cheaper and that yeah, and I think maybe people will be less reluctant this year to do

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:49.300
Intel based devices or maybe they'll be more inclined to do it because the way has been proven last year that it is possible to make

01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:56.660
Intel tablets that you know survive a decent battery life and our performance and you know can run all the same applications

01:24:56.660 --> 01:25:02.580
Yeah, I mean this good. Sorry Chris gone. No, I just gonna say I wouldn't put it past Intel to be able to pull it off

01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:04.700
You know this time last year

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:10.420
My dad was looking for a tablet an Android tablet and one of the Samsung tablets had an Intel chip in it

01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:14.260
And it was significantly cheaper than the the Samsung

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:19.500
10.1 arm box and I advised my dad not to get the Intel

01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:25.300
Device because I said you're gonna be limited in the apps that are available at this point because it's um, you know fairly new

01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:32.220
Technology and not everyone's adopted it yet. Yeah, I'd feel a bit differently this year if it was me spending money on a tablet

01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:36.340
I might seriously think about an Intel tablet because I can hack more with it

01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:42.820
Yeah, my main my main tablet is an Intel one. Yeah, and it's it's better than any arm tablet

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:47.260
Yeah, I would much if I was gonna buy a tablet that I would much prefer to have an x86 tablet

01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:49.260
I want all the things about an ARM tablet too though

01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:53.860
But that's just me and you guys like we prefer x86 because well

01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:56.820
It's just easier to load anything we want on it a but B

01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:02.980
We prefer it because it's x86 and it runs our stuff consumers. Don't give a crap about that though. They don't give a crap

01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:05.700
I actually want the ARM laptop though. I

01:26:07.140 --> 01:26:12.100
I'm surprised we I mean there are some out there. I'm I'm honestly surprised like an Android

01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:19.180
How come how come some major OEM hasn't released an Android based laptop in the US? I think there's some in Asia

01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:21.620
I

01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:25.020
Could have stamped on a few people that have done this haven't they? Oh, okay

01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:34.080
Chrome OS arm. Yeah, I'm laptop. Yeah. Yeah Chrome OS is gonna have a good year over 2015. I think

01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:42.500
You Samsung Chromebooks are hard to get in Canada and this is the only reason why I don't have a

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:50.460
Arm laptop. Yeah, those of you who are on Google Plus today may have spotted

01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:53.180
that a Google intern

01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:59.060
Now with I guess potentially Google blessing. I'm trying to find the post on Google Plus right now, which never happens for me

01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:03.620
I said earlier you might oh you did. Oh, okay. All right. I'll go search for you

01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:07.820
So, you know what I'm talking about then that that that there is a crew ton like in a window now

01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:09.820
Yeah, here it is right here. Yeah. Oh, yeah

01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:14.520
Yeah, so a Google intern has added support to run crew ton in a Chrome OS window

01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:17.480
Thanks to four hundred and forty seven one lines of code

01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:24.720
Fearless people can now run their favorite Linux distributions on their Chrome devices in a window without jumping between terminals

01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:30.080
So now now Ubuntu or another distro could be

01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:35.900
Essentially like an app on Chrome OS. So part of me thinks that's great. That's awesome. It allows you to

01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:42.780
Switch more easily between the two and part of me thinks is this Google doing their best to try and keep you away from

01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:47.020
the second OS that people are putting on they're

01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:54.820
Very cheap, you know Google so yeah Chrome devices in order to keep you in Chrome. I think it has to be that

01:27:56.540 --> 01:28:00.460
That's it that's because that's the only thing it does that's it doesn't improve performance

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:05.820
It keeps you in Chrome OS and it makes this a feature of Chrome OS. I

01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:10.900
Which is fine for some people and we shouldn't be doom and gloom about it because

01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:16.060
You could make the same argument about you know open office and Libre office and get being available for Windows

01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:19.260
All those people stay on Windows it helps, you know people make the transition

01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:25.380
I think though it's it's gonna be I think it's telling I think it's telling how 2015 is gonna go

01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:27.900
my thoughts

01:28:27.900 --> 01:28:30.540
It's gonna be interesting. I you know it's gonna be one of those things

01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:34.500
I think we're gonna have to hold up a stick to see it move cuz I don't think it's gonna happen quite as quickly as

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:39.080
People anticipate we'll get to the end. Yeah, well. No you're right. We'll get to the end, and we'll be like whoa

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.080
Whoa what happened what happened? Oh?

01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:45.140
Oh, yeah, that makes sense now that makes sense and we could be all wrong about all of this

01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:49.140
We may be wrong you have a chance timing in context you have a chance to prove us wrong

01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:54.400
You never know you can hold us accountable you can because it's now it is documented forever right here on the Linux unplug show

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.400
So Matt if we got it wrong. It's on the record

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:59.620
That's right. You actually got like the best record out of all of us though, so

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:03.560
You you like nailed all of your predictions last year, so I don't even want it

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.800
I'm the guy that said the Google public offering thing was a

01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:12.240
Classic there's that class you go back far enough

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:18.860
If you'd like to make your prediction go over to Linux action show dot reddit.com and leave your feedback in this week's thread or go

01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:22.460
To Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact and send yours in and we might read it on a future show

01:29:22.460 --> 01:29:26.980
Don't forget you can join us live on Tuesdays 2 p.m.. Pacific over to jblive.tv for that

01:29:27.100 --> 01:29:32.580
Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar to get it converted in your local time zone and last but not least

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:36.460
We'd love to have you join us in that mumble room. It's an open mumble room

01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:40.660
You can be part of our virtual lug you just gotta get your mic checked jblive.tv on a Tuesday

01:29:40.660 --> 01:29:52.660
See you back here next week everybody. Thanks so much for listening to this week's episode of Linux unplugged. See you next Tuesday. Oh

01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:07.940
I have a last-minute breaking prediction for myself

01:30:07.940 --> 01:30:13.340
I will spend an inappropriate amount of money on steam games and my wife will give me a hard time in the month of December

01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:15.340
In 2015 that's my prediction

01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:18.540
What was it a fist of Jesus or something like that?

01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:24.500
Wasn't as good as I had hoped but there's some other good ones out there. Yeah

01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:32.460
Yeah, oh yeah, you got more you got more my prediction is that Sony is going to be hacked and

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:37.620
And aliens will be blamed for it. Oh aliens. All right. All right

01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:40.620
JB titles like on everybody

01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:42.420
Wimpy did you have more?

01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:47.340
Why I didn't have more but nobody mentioned wearables or Windows 10, which is surprising

01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:51.260
I would have thought somebody would have had a prediction about those two things either

01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:54.260
We don't give a shit about it and what we think is irrelevant and therefore

01:30:55.060 --> 01:30:57.060
not not discussion worthy or

01:30:57.060 --> 01:31:02.940
I don't know. I think maybe on wearables. I think yes, I think on wearables. That is true

01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:05.140
I think on Windows 10, we're all a little melancholy because

01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:09.020
Microsoft's ripping us off and it's probably gonna help stop the bleeding a little bit

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:16.180
Yeah, I didn't want to say it, but I've got a horrible feeling that Windows 10 could suck some Linux users back

01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:20.020
No, they weren't good Linux users to begin with then

01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:26.980
These are the kind of people that are using Linux because it doesn't cost them anything. Yeah rather than right

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:30.460
They you know buy into the culture. Yep. That's very true

01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:34.580
Hmm. That's a yeah the Windows 10 and the wearables thing

01:31:36.060 --> 01:31:41.220
Yeah, and the other thing about it is I think the Apple watch probably the most successful and that sucks so bad because it's

01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:45.480
The most locked in one like you can't use it with your Linux desktop. You can't lose use it with your Android device

01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:48.020
It's the iPod iPhone situation all over again meets watches

01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:56.660
Yeah, yeah is Windows 10. I'm going to be free. Yes for consumers. So I don't think the business one will be free though

01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:59.380
No, there's gonna be some

01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:05.700
Hobbled version for home users isn't there? There's gonna be free and I think that will tempt people back

01:32:06.940 --> 01:32:12.500
Well returning the conversation to wearables. I still think that pebble is the only

01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:15.780
Smart watch that I would consider buying

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:23.620
Yeah, that is a good that that one's very calling. Let's see. The for me is I already have to charge my

01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:30.160
Phone every day. I already have to charge my laptop every day. I have to charge my tablet every day

01:32:30.980 --> 01:32:32.260
I

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:35.420
Don't want to add another device to that list

01:32:36.220 --> 01:32:41.040
especially something that a watch used to be something that I didn't have to

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:45.320
Think about yeah, it would just run forever, right? Yeah

01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:53.520
The ones that have like a dock that you can put next to your bed and our bedside clock with an alarm

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:58.980
You know every time you go to bed, you just take it off. Yeah, like the motor that see yeah, that makes it way more

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:02.240
This is a valid argument

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:08.960
But I don't think you know how often I forget to transfer my phone and then wake up in the morning with like 5%

01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:14.680
Of the body lead. Oh, I guess yeah, so the same I I collect

01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:23.880
Classic digital watches from sort of the 70s in the early 80s and some of the models from the 70s that have got the LED

01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:25.880
Displays. Oh, yeah

01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:32.000
They burn the battery really fast in that the battery burns out in about six months

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.940
which used to be considered a major pain in the ass, but against smart watches, which

01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:39.660
At the end of the day

01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:43.820
You're mostly going to use for telling the time on that you need to show at least once a day

01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:47.660
Look fucking epic all rumors. Now. That's long since gone

01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:53.900
So is the foosball table and pinball machine and the the cocktail arcade cabinets and I know Popey's got one of those

01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:59.980
Popey you've got bomb Jack haven't you you bugger? Hmm cocktail bomb Jack never even heard of that. Ah

01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:04.980
Bomb Jack is the best arcade game from the 19th. Oh, maybe I'm just

01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:06.980
I

01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:12.580
Know you do we've discussed this. Yeah, he bombed Jack is great. Okay. All right. I'm looking up right now

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:17.940
It's one of the it's one of the only games where I had to rotate the screen in my arcade cabinet

01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:19.940
I had to like the screen out

01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:26.220
Cool bomb Jack is ice and the reason I love bomb Jack is um, I

01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:34.100
Participated in the the world arcade games on two occasions and the games that I

01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:36.100
I played were a bomb Jack

01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:41.100
1942 and GR kung fu and I was European champion for bomb Jack

01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:46.860
But I did I didn't get the the world title. Well done, sir. I see that I get to get this looks fun

01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:50.100
It's really good. Yeah, a little stressful little stressful

01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:54.660
No, it looks a little stressful because you only got a limited time to get around and there's a lot of guys in your way

01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:58.900
And you have to do it in sequence as well. That's where you really ramp up your points

01:34:58.900 --> 01:35:02.660
That's the whole the whole point of the game is learn all the sequences on all of the levels

01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:06.580
It's great. And and the blizzard detection is just

01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:13.620
Forgiving enough that you can pull off some really tight moves around the the enemies. It's a really well designed game

01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:17.780
Hmm that was in fact new into the android

01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:21.860
Uh play store is free jack

01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:27.700
Yes, free jack has a free version and a paid version that's only just turned up and it's basically a clone of bomb jack

01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:30.340
So, uh, yeah, give that a go

01:35:30.340 --> 01:35:35.860
Huh? I have heard of free jack. Did you guys see that the uh, did you guys hear about this, uh, ide for gnome?

01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:37.060
Did you see this?

01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:40.820
No, i've been hearing about it. Yeah builder and ide for gnome is doing an indiegogo project

01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:47.880
They've raised 12 000 out of 30 000 so far gnome a modern elegant desktop with a wide range of applications

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:50.660
And high focus on usability

01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:56.420
But underneath the surface gnome is showing its age. Our developer tools on linux are from the last decade

01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:58.740
meet jim

01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:00.740
Jim wants to start contributing to free software

01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:05.220
Our community is strong and happy to help but how should jim begin writing software?

01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:12.980
As of today, there are too many tools jim needs to learn first get the group builder the perfect development environment for jim

01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:16.020
Builder is an idea of mine

01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:22.660
This summer I quit my job to focus on creating a new ide from scratch with everything a developer will look for in a development

01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:28.520
Environment by integrating gnome's documentation and platform api with a powerful editor and ui designer

01:36:28.840 --> 01:36:31.160
We can make it easy for people like jim to contribute

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:35.960
With the funds this fundraiser can provide I will work on builder full time

01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:42.920
If we reach 30 000 I can work full time for the next three months and implement builder's core features

01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:45.880
Here's a spotlight of three of them

01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:49.160
With global search you can find and open anything you need

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:52.920
Builder will as you type find files and documentation

01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:56.280
This can even be extended by additional search providers in the future

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.800
Many free software projects use a combination of tools to manage themselves known as auto tools

01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:04.520
Builder intends to automate the use of these tools

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:08.200
This will make it easy for anyone to build and manage their projects

01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:15.340
Builder will have autocompletion for c and c plus plus if we reach our stretch goal. We'll add support for vala and pythons

01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:23.420
To make writing even easier builder will also provide auto indentation and api exploration on the fly

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:29.800
So the idea is like if you want to start developing for the linux desktop, uh, you know right now

01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:34.120
There's not a real clear path you're supposed to take this is something we've heard about from people that write in necoda radio

01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.960
They're like, you know, you're not going to be able to do this

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:38.840
This is something we've heard about from people that write in necoda radio. They're like I

01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:42.920
I've been writing applications for this platform for my entire life now

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:45.560
I want to write for linux and I have no idea where i'm supposed to start

01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:49.480
Uh, do you have any advice and this is kind of like you would the idea here

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:54.920
But you point them to this and to give the uh, the project credit like the guy quit his job, uh in the summer

01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:59.720
He's been working on it over the whole summer and the budget of 30 000 is also included like

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:05.800
Going to conferences to talk about it with people and you know doing collaboration and stuff like that. I'm kind of impressed

01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:07.800
I think i'm gonna back it. It's not

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.240
You're not impressed why you think it's just a text editor. What's the problem?

01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:15.980
Do you want all my concerns about this in the form of a list or should I make a presentation?

01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:20.040
Wow, just give me the top give me your top three

01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:23.720
Okay. So first of all, if you want to contribute to any

01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:30.680
Linux based projects regardless of your skill level if you just want to contribute go to the irc

01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:35.240
Uh channel of that project and tell the guys that you want to contribute

01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:38.520
So that's how you have to do

01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:42.040
That's antiquated and painful. Yeah, and the thing is they don't know that a they don't know

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:45.880
They don't they don't know that and b the thing is then what tool you tell them to go use

01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.960
What tool are they supposed to go use because they don't like that

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:51.160
but no see that the thing is is like there it's

01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:57.160
It's hard for us to understand but there's one tool. It's causal. Well, I think I was gonna say vi, uh, no

01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:02.200
No, if the the thing is is like you tell them that and that that to me makes sense

01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:06.840
But then when you tell developers that that I don't have any familiarity with the linux platform they glaze over there's too many options

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.520
There's too many choices. There's no obvious path

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:08.920
No, dude

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:14.440
It works like this if you want to write for ios or you want to write for android go to this website create an account

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:20.440
Download this single program and that's all you have to tell the developer and they can go make an app for that platform

01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:25.800
When they don't have to wait for someone in irc to like answer their question or hopefully get the same answer twice or whatever

01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:29.080
And when you or or have a holy war like oh you want to use eclipse?

01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:33.800
You should use vi like or no like they just need something and I totally agree with you

01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:34.920
I I think it's kind of silly

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:39.560
But when I see it from their perspective I can see where builder fills that niche a little bit and it could you know

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.720
Maybe help the developers get started

01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:47.480
Okay, but as far as I can tell from the video and from this the description on the project

01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:51.160
And this is my second point. Also, it doesn't really

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:56.700
Help you it just in the search bar. It also searches the documentation

01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.920
And it's not really that impressive what you get is this

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:06.360
unity scope style search of everything and it really

01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:12.600
Distorted results because half the time the top result will not be what?

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:15.720
Even in the category of what you're looking for

01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:22.120
They they well, it also has a ui designer as well and a few other like debugger and things like that in there

01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:24.120
So you have those tools already?

01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:30.760
Yeah, we do. Um, and we have something like cute creator which does all of this already very nicely

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:36.120
So but it's not gnome specific and they want something for gnome. That's why

01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:41.320
And there are gnome tools for c and c sharp with ui designers already

01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:44.680
Well, there's a difference between there are and are they good

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:49.240
In the video it specifically says they want one tool to do it all. Yeah. Well, yeah

01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:54.920
Another thing is like a valid point. Yeah, is it it doesn't exist or is it good?

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:58.520
I have no guarantee that what this guy is making is going to be any better

01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:04.200
No, that's fair. It may it may suck toes, but it'd be interesting to see him try. Yeah, you know, what were your thoughts winnie?

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.200
Is the order of things calm?

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:11.080
Chris was talking about, um, you know building a tool that's going to help you build a tool

01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:16.120
Chris was talking about um, you know building something for linux

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:21.320
Um, and I don't want to rag on this project because more development tools is a good thing as far as i'm concerned

01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:27.240
But this is a development tool that's aimed at building applications for gnome gnome 3

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:30.220
And what poppy has described is an sdk

01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:35.560
uh that's designed to build, uh, uh applications for

01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:37.380
ubuntu

01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:42.920
Specifically ubuntu touch and what will become no, I think to create. Yeah. Yeah, so it's going to be you know

01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:45.480
Ubuntu in the future. No

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:52.040
Creator is independent of us. Yeah. Well, yeah, I know but it's it's ubuntu, isn't it? It's about making apps for ubuntu

01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:03.880
I have to support wimpy here. The only time I used cute creator was to make apps for ubuntu

01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:07.720
No, no, no, it is not an ubuntu thing. But I think what poppy's or what wimpy's getting at is

01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:12.840
That's what poppy wants to see right? Yeah. Yeah, I mean no no no if I if I if I went meant to say that

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:19.720
I would have said ubuntu. I agree. I specifically said cute creator. I think wimpy's it's already existing wimpy's having a go at you

01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:21.880
Uh and one that I appreciate

01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:27.080
I am pointing out that

01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:29.080
Ubuntu is is

01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:35.800
Heading down a road of you develop for ubuntu. You don't develop for linux you develop for ubuntu and that's no bad thing

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:37.800
That's that's an admirable

01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:40.600
Objective, you know

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:45.000
It's kind of a commercial objective and I can understand where those commercial pressures are going to come from

01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:48.440
But this is not that neither of these tools are addressing

01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:58.840
Uh developing for linux
