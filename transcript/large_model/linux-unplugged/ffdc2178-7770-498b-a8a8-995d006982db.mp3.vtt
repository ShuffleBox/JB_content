WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
Starting the show off with an amazing discovery, ArchiveOS,

00:03.600 --> 00:05.520
the Archive of Operating Systems.

00:05.520 --> 00:09.960
Its mission is to save great free operating systems,

00:09.960 --> 00:13.500
Linux, of course, the BSDs, the free DOSs, Solaris,

00:13.500 --> 00:16.200
and many other independent operating systems,

00:16.200 --> 00:17.840
and make it bootable.

00:17.840 --> 00:18.880
Look at this thing, Wes.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.120
How beautiful is this?

00:20.120 --> 00:22.160
It's like the Internet Archive in an ISO.

00:22.160 --> 00:24.480
A testament to the ages.

00:24.480 --> 00:28.960
So you can go check it out at ArchiveOS.org.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.440
And I'm going to look into this more.

00:30.440 --> 00:31.240
I got to try this.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.320
They say it's important to save systems

00:33.320 --> 00:35.760
and let the next generation of users find them, try them,

00:35.760 --> 00:37.620
and learn as much as possible.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.280
This has been rattling around in my head.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.520
I haven't tried this, obviously.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.280
But what's been rattling around in my head

00:42.280 --> 00:44.360
is trying to set up some old VMs,

00:44.360 --> 00:47.880
or I should say set up new VMs of old versions of Linux,

00:47.880 --> 00:50.640
just to like, what was it like to use KDE 2?

00:50.640 --> 00:52.440
What was it like to use GNOME 2?

00:52.440 --> 00:53.720
Like, what was it really like?

00:53.720 --> 00:55.480
Because we refer to it all the time.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.360
I've been really tempted to set up some VMs to do this,

00:58.360 --> 01:00.520
just to have them sitting around when I want to try it.

01:00.520 --> 01:01.560
Oh, yeah, right.

01:01.560 --> 01:04.840
And I think that's where this site is maybe useful.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.800
A lot of times, maybe you have a disk image or a tarball,

01:07.800 --> 01:10.200
but it's a long way from actually making things bootable.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.880
So if you have some of this set up already to go,

01:11.880 --> 01:12.880
you might actually use it.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.440
That would be the perfect part, like one ISO you download,

01:15.440 --> 01:17.800
you load it on your machine, and it boots the whole thing up.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.960
That would be the holy grail.

01:18.960 --> 01:20.240
Maybe they'll get there one day.

01:20.240 --> 01:20.840
Maybe they'll get there.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.080
But right now, they're just archiving

01:22.080 --> 01:23.380
these old, great operating systems.

01:23.380 --> 01:25.800
If you do want to try this, it's a great resource for that,

01:25.800 --> 01:27.140
so you can build your own system.

01:27.140 --> 01:29.800
One day, we may get to that ISO.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.600
Somebody should build it and call it

01:31.600 --> 01:32.940
the Linux Unplugged Booter.

01:32.940 --> 01:33.560
No, don't do that.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.440
Call it something else.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.320
Yeah, definitely something else.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.800
As I look at the pile of ThinkPads stacked up

01:38.800 --> 01:39.960
in the corner of the room.

01:39.960 --> 01:41.080
You are building an archive.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.280
Different operating systems.

01:42.280 --> 01:43.280
How many do you have there?

01:43.280 --> 01:44.280
How many ThinkPads is it?

01:44.280 --> 01:46.080
Do you want to reveal the number?

01:46.080 --> 01:47.840
Well, from what I can see in front of me,

01:47.840 --> 01:50.800
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.880
Seven, I think, as I can see.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.280
You could just have various different states of Linux

01:56.280 --> 01:58.640
on each one of them, like a cross-section.

01:58.640 --> 01:59.680
Yeah.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.480
I kind of like them to be usable,

02:01.480 --> 02:04.460
like actual usable machines, not just something

02:04.460 --> 02:07.680
that you put in a cupboard and never think about again.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.660
So there's actually two on my desk right now.

02:09.660 --> 02:15.000
One of them is a machine that we use for audio production.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
I don't actually use it.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.880
Samantha uses it for audio production on the podcast.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.920
But the other one that is on right now,

02:20.920 --> 02:24.920
I'm running offline IMAP to synchronize all my email down

02:24.920 --> 02:26.520
from Gmail, because I quite like having

02:26.520 --> 02:28.160
an offline copy of all my email.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.960
Just in case anything goes wrong,

02:29.960 --> 02:32.160
I can open this laptop up, and it's

02:32.160 --> 02:34.200
got a local copy of all my email.

02:34.200 --> 02:38.120
And I've got MUT installed on there, so add a pinch.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.000
It's got no GUI.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.960
I've got no graphical interface on this thing at all.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.600
It's only command line applications.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.320
And offline IMAP sync my mail, and then MUT

02:45.320 --> 02:47.380
if I need to actually write an email.

02:47.380 --> 02:50.560
So now I can visualize you during the zombie apocalypse,

02:50.560 --> 02:54.400
hunched over this old laptop, reading your email on MUT.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.800
It's beautiful.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.560
And I have a lot of email to read.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.320
So once the zombies come, I'll be

02:59.320 --> 03:01.080
quite busy reading all my old archives.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.440
Right, of course.

03:02.440 --> 03:05.720
But on that old laptop, only seven minutes to read it all.

03:05.720 --> 03:08.480
Yeah, right.

03:08.480 --> 03:13.920
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 249 from May 15, 2018.

03:13.920 --> 03:28.920
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

03:28.920 --> 03:32.360
that undoubtedly should have gone to that English class

03:32.360 --> 03:33.640
more often.

03:33.640 --> 03:34.520
And my name is Chris.

03:34.520 --> 03:35.440
My name is Wes.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.440
I'm just saying, it might have helped out

03:36.440 --> 03:36.960
in this whole podcasting crew.

03:36.960 --> 03:37.800
It probably would.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.480
Went into IET, ended up podcasting.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.880
You know, Wes, we'll muddle through.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.160
We have a great show.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.760
We're going to talk about Gnome removing the ability

03:45.760 --> 03:46.840
to launch binary apps.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.280
That's been the hot topic in our community this week.

03:49.280 --> 03:50.040
Hot, hot, hot.

03:50.040 --> 03:50.640
Yeah.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.680
We'll do a deep dive into the new bookmark sync

03:52.680 --> 03:57.640
stuff that's coming to Firefox, talk about System 76 and LVFS

03:57.640 --> 04:00.120
back and forth, and some new features

04:00.120 --> 04:02.440
that look like they could be coming to Gnome if Will Cook

04:02.440 --> 04:04.160
gets his way.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.340
Wimpy's here with a new trick.

04:06.340 --> 04:09.000
And malware may have been found in the Snap Store.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.080
Is everything ruined?

04:11.080 --> 04:14.200
We'll get all worked up and super upset.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.840
Plus, the folks from Plasma, well, some of them at least,

04:16.840 --> 04:19.440
went to Berlin and came back with some code.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.020
We'll talk about data collection in 1804

04:22.020 --> 04:23.800
and some of the attempts to generate

04:23.800 --> 04:25.640
controversy for ad clicks.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.320
And purism gets busted by Intel.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.040
We alluded to this on a recent Linux action news,

04:31.040 --> 04:32.880
but now we have a lot more details.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.880
And then we'll ask if Docker is dangerous

04:34.880 --> 04:39.040
and if it's time to just drop that all GTK or all cute

04:39.040 --> 04:40.160
mentality.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.760
Is it still relevant today, Wes?

04:41.760 --> 04:43.400
We'll find out.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.480
Don't answer.

04:45.480 --> 04:46.600
We're going to get into that.

04:46.600 --> 04:48.900
But before we go any further, we've

04:48.900 --> 04:50.280
got to bring in that mumble room.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.980
Time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

04:51.980 --> 04:53.080
Hey-oh, hey-oh.

04:53.080 --> 04:56.160
Hello, good evening.

04:56.160 --> 04:56.720
I like that.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.560
That was a good mix this week.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.080
Didn't expect that one coming.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.040
So I want to start with the elephant in the room,

05:02.040 --> 05:04.680
and that is the story about Gnome removing the ability

05:04.680 --> 05:07.840
to launch binary apps from Nautilus.

05:07.840 --> 05:12.480
So we got the big news from last Gnome release

05:12.480 --> 05:15.560
really was the removal of the desktop application icons,

05:15.560 --> 05:17.200
the desktop icons from Nautilus.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.360
And now it looks like this is sort of a continuation

05:19.360 --> 05:22.840
of that cleanup is really launching

05:22.840 --> 05:25.400
binary applications when you double click on them in Nautilus.

05:25.400 --> 05:29.880
So like.bin and.run files, perhaps app images as well,

05:29.880 --> 05:34.080
.desktop shortcuts, or a shell script that you might execute.

05:34.080 --> 05:37.880
You know, like the dumb arse that I am apparently

05:37.880 --> 05:39.000
doing things the old way.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.360
I just downloaded a new game off of a good old games, GOG,

05:43.360 --> 05:46.040
and was assuming I would just be able to double click

05:46.040 --> 05:46.540
and run it.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.000
I don't know what I was thinking.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.560
I should have definitely considered opening the terminal

05:49.560 --> 05:50.920
and running it that way.

05:50.920 --> 05:51.640
Of course you should.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.760
You should be running all your programs that way, Chris.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.080
Now, it's pretty easy to poke fun at this decision.

05:56.080 --> 05:59.080
And it, of course, plays into that whole narrative of Gnome

05:59.080 --> 06:00.880
always removing functionality.

06:00.880 --> 06:05.680
I think the common reaction I've seen on the various internet

06:05.680 --> 06:08.400
outlets is just when you thought Gnome couldn't

06:08.400 --> 06:10.360
take any more functionality, they're

06:10.360 --> 06:13.920
taking away the ability to run apps.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.120
But that's a little hype.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.640
It's not really that.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.360
It's more really about how apps should

06:18.360 --> 06:20.440
be launched from the app launcher,

06:20.440 --> 06:25.240
and the files app should be managing files.

06:25.240 --> 06:26.720
And they think removing the ability

06:26.720 --> 06:30.720
to launch binaries from Nautilus will improve its security.

06:30.720 --> 06:34.800
And, of course, there will still be other ways to launch apps.

06:34.800 --> 06:35.840
So what do you think?

06:35.840 --> 06:39.320
Initial impressions, when you hear this kind of thing, Wes,

06:39.320 --> 06:44.880
are you so tired from drama that you're just sort of numb to it?

06:44.880 --> 06:47.120
Or do you have a strong response to this?

06:47.120 --> 06:51.520
OK, I will admit to being at least a little bit numb.

06:51.520 --> 06:52.920
I also have some sympathies.

06:52.920 --> 06:56.200
I feel like Gnome gets viewed as so many different things

06:56.200 --> 06:57.400
and a lot of different roles.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.120
Some of that might be valid, especially now

06:59.120 --> 07:01.760
on so many desktops by default. But that's really

07:01.760 --> 07:03.400
the distribution's choice.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.160
I can see why Gnome wants to craft things

07:05.160 --> 07:08.200
into a more elegant desktop for the future.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.120
Maybe not all users are ready for that.

07:10.120 --> 07:13.360
I can see why people want to keep a lot of standard paradigms

07:13.360 --> 07:14.600
around.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.400
I personally don't need them.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.160
I'm OK with Gnome developing into whatever

07:18.160 --> 07:19.400
it is that they want.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.200
I understand why it upsets people, though, because, hey,

07:22.200 --> 07:23.600
this is a lot of people's workflows.

07:23.600 --> 07:24.600
You can't do it anymore.

07:24.600 --> 07:25.640
You're not allergic to bees, are you?

07:25.640 --> 07:26.480
Because there is a wasp.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.080
Oh, look at that.

07:27.080 --> 07:27.640
Wow.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.480
Here, maybe you could put this on top of him.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.400
There you go, Wes.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.640
Maybe you could trap that wasp that's walking around

07:33.640 --> 07:35.080
by your hand there, Wes.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.480
Just a little Pacific Northwest summer.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.040
There you go.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.440
That surely won't piss him off.

07:43.440 --> 07:46.040
Now he's trapped in the bell.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.680
Now let's ring it.

07:48.680 --> 07:50.320
All right, well, I agree.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.600
I think that people often lump Gnome into one singular

07:53.600 --> 07:56.480
category when it's a bunch of individual developers and people

07:56.480 --> 07:58.080
that are doing a lot of different work,

07:58.080 --> 08:00.280
and it often encompasses many projects.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.880
And all of those disclosures aside,

08:02.880 --> 08:06.480
I can't imagine something like this ever landing in, like,

08:06.480 --> 08:07.960
Kaja, for example.

08:07.960 --> 08:09.000
What do you think, Wimpy?

08:09.000 --> 08:09.560
Would you see it?

08:09.560 --> 08:11.160
Could you see a rationale for something

08:11.160 --> 08:13.880
like this landing in a Maté desktop environment?

08:13.880 --> 08:18.640
Well, probably not, because we choose not to remove features,

08:18.640 --> 08:20.080
if at all possible.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.560
So the only time features go away

08:21.560 --> 08:25.120
is when they can't technically be supported anymore.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.360
But then I was thinking about this.

08:27.360 --> 08:30.920
How often do people actually launch binaries

08:30.920 --> 08:32.640
with the file manager?

08:32.640 --> 08:35.000
I think it's more common to a group of people

08:35.000 --> 08:36.800
that this is going to most negatively impact,

08:36.800 --> 08:39.560
and that's new users that get switched to Linux,

08:39.560 --> 08:42.200
or people that are buying commercial software.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.040
I've definitely noticed the folks

08:44.040 --> 08:45.960
that I've helped move to Linux, they

08:45.960 --> 08:48.360
have this habit of Google searching,

08:48.360 --> 08:50.240
and then going and downloading the deb,

08:50.240 --> 08:52.280
or downloading a binary file, or like when

08:52.280 --> 08:53.880
you buy something from GOG.

08:53.880 --> 08:54.760
Right, I can see that.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.720
Or I use this program, oh, they have Linux,

08:56.720 --> 08:58.560
I'm finally on Linux, they gave me a tarball,

08:58.560 --> 08:59.560
what do I do with this?

08:59.560 --> 09:00.280
Yeah.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.720
So a deb isn't executable though, right?

09:02.720 --> 09:05.240
You double click a deb, and it launches something else

09:05.240 --> 09:07.920
that handles the installation, or you double click an image.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.400
I'm just commenting on the behavior.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.760
That's just the behavior.

09:10.760 --> 09:14.080
I think the instinct for Windows users

09:14.080 --> 09:17.160
is to download things off of the vendor's website,

09:17.160 --> 09:18.760
whoever that vendor might be.

09:18.760 --> 09:23.120
Right, but even those crazy lunatic third-party app

09:23.120 --> 09:27.120
developers create desktop files, and launchers,

09:27.120 --> 09:29.840
and if you download, let's say for example,

09:29.840 --> 09:31.600
a simple example like Telegram.

09:31.600 --> 09:34.760
If you go and get Telegram from their website,

09:34.760 --> 09:37.280
there's a simple executable, you run it once,

09:37.280 --> 09:40.840
and then you've got an icon forevermore

09:40.840 --> 09:42.320
in your launcher, your menu.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.240
Right, same with the GOG game.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.440
I bought that new fancy looking space game,

09:46.440 --> 09:47.360
I can't remember what it's called.

09:47.360 --> 09:47.840
Space game.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.080
But it looks really good.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.320
And it's a bin file that downloads,

09:51.320 --> 09:54.720
and then when you double click it, it then launches a GTK

09:54.720 --> 09:57.360
installer, and that does create a.desktop file,

09:57.360 --> 09:58.440
and all that kind of stuff.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.360
But you've got to double click that bin file

10:00.360 --> 10:03.200
to get that GTK installer to create the desktop file.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.920
But is the ultimate goal of this in the GNOME project

10:06.920 --> 10:11.440
to break the habit of these bad patterns of downloading

10:11.440 --> 10:13.960
something from the internet, and then just double clicking it,

10:13.960 --> 10:17.240
and expecting it to work, and it not be full of malware?

10:17.240 --> 10:18.120
Maybe, yeah.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.640
I mean, I think you could make a pretty solid security

10:20.640 --> 10:22.880
argument from that standpoint, and you could argue

10:22.880 --> 10:24.480
if they feel the code isn't up to snuff

10:24.480 --> 10:25.640
that they shouldn't be maintaining it.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.640
You could just base the argument off of that.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.400
It does kind of remind me, too, of some of the,

10:29.400 --> 10:32.120
you know, maybe like a Chrome OS type environment,

10:32.120 --> 10:34.440
or iOS, where these newer environments that were designed

10:34.440 --> 10:37.000
in the world we have now don't have some of these legacy

10:37.000 --> 10:38.680
things, but people who are familiar enough

10:38.680 --> 10:40.480
with the file system, familiar enough with, yeah,

10:40.480 --> 10:43.720
just like running binaries, feels like a big loss.

10:43.720 --> 10:45.000
I don't really ever do this.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.120
I guess the one area, it kind of sucks for app images, maybe.

10:48.120 --> 10:48.800
Yeah, yeah.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.640
Other than that, it doesn't really affect me.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.280
I guess I just don't agree that you can change user behavior

10:53.280 --> 10:53.960
this way.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.440
I don't think this ever works.

10:55.440 --> 10:56.960
I think you just piss off users.

10:56.960 --> 10:57.800
And I think what you're going to have is.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.720
Or filter your base then, right?

10:59.720 --> 11:01.480
And you're going to have distros that are just going

11:01.480 --> 11:03.880
to ship another extension, just like they're shipping

11:03.880 --> 11:05.960
extensions now to restore desktop icons,

11:05.960 --> 11:08.600
or they're shipping extensions now to restore tray icons.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.360
Now they're going to be shipping an extension

11:10.360 --> 11:12.800
to execute binary files.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.560
That's likely the biggest impact,

11:15.560 --> 11:18.920
is that it'll just be now the work of the distribution

11:18.920 --> 11:19.720
maintainers.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.520
Or they'll hold back the version of Nautilus

11:21.520 --> 11:23.720
that has this patched out and patch it back in again.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.440
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.200
I have a link to the mailing list discussion.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.200
Let's say give it a read.

11:29.200 --> 11:32.880
And give the team some slack to just figure this stuff out.

11:32.880 --> 11:34.320
Like, the world hasn't fallen apart

11:34.320 --> 11:37.360
with the removal of desktop icons from GNOME 3.2.8.

11:37.360 --> 11:37.880
True.

11:37.880 --> 11:38.600
We're still here.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.240
We're still holding good.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.160
And people that really need it have extensions.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.680
I think also there's like, yeah, people have extensions.

11:44.680 --> 11:46.040
And if you're listening to this program,

11:46.040 --> 11:48.480
you probably know that there's a bunch of other fine desktop.

11:48.480 --> 11:51.000
So if we're having this debate in the context of like,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.320
what should the new user experience be, or the standard,

11:53.320 --> 11:54.000
that's one thing.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.280
But for a lot of us, we just don't have to care,

11:56.280 --> 11:57.520
because there's lots of choice.

11:57.520 --> 12:00.240
Poby, are you still rocking Firefox as your daily driver

12:00.240 --> 12:01.080
if you cave to Chrome?

12:01.080 --> 12:01.320
Yep.

12:01.320 --> 12:01.880
All right.

12:01.880 --> 12:02.480
Yep, yep.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.480
No, the only reason I use Chrome is

12:04.480 --> 12:06.440
to talk to Wimpy on a daily basis,

12:06.440 --> 12:09.720
because the video chat thing we use only works in Chrome.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.280
Yeah, I have similar.

12:11.280 --> 12:14.600
I've made an Electron app of the video conferencing tool

12:14.600 --> 12:17.080
we make, so I don't have to have Chrome or Chromium installed

12:17.080 --> 12:18.600
anymore.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.440
How do you make an Electron app of any Rando website?

12:21.440 --> 12:22.760
I would love to know that.

12:22.760 --> 12:27.360
I will send you a link in IRC to the Ubuntu tutorial guide

12:27.360 --> 12:28.520
that explains how to do it.

12:28.520 --> 12:31.000
Thank you, because I have a similar situation.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.640
I have one app that I have to use Chrome for.

12:33.640 --> 12:34.680
Yeah, that's a great app.

12:34.680 --> 12:35.400
We should do that.

12:35.400 --> 12:35.720
I know.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.440
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.560
So Firefox is just getting better and better.

12:39.560 --> 12:45.880
And Beta 61 and the Nightly 62 have a new sync system

12:45.880 --> 12:48.760
that is going to address some of all of the complaints,

12:48.760 --> 12:51.760
actually, I've really ever had with Firefox Bookmarks.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.520
This is something, their sync system with Firefox Bookmarks

12:54.520 --> 12:57.680
has always sort of been a retrofitted solution,

12:57.680 --> 13:01.200
where Chrome was sort of engineered from the beginning.

13:01.200 --> 13:05.040
And now, Firefox, the team over at Mozilla

13:05.040 --> 13:08.320
that creates Firefox for iOS, has quite a bit

13:08.320 --> 13:11.360
of experience with this, because when they created Firefox for OS,

13:11.360 --> 13:14.120
they created it with syncing in mind.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.960
And they created this whole JSON system,

13:15.960 --> 13:17.800
and they created this dual database system

13:17.800 --> 13:20.320
of your active bookmarks and the synced bookmarks,

13:20.320 --> 13:23.720
and even a third database for conflict resolution.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.280
And then they had a really great system

13:25.280 --> 13:28.480
for keeping it all straight and keeping track of everything.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.120
And when they engineered this, they

13:30.120 --> 13:33.520
looked back at their Firefox desktop sync engine

13:33.520 --> 13:36.000
and said, well, how could we apply lessons learned to the iOS

13:36.000 --> 13:38.160
sync engine to the desktop?

13:38.160 --> 13:40.040
And that's now essentially what they're doing.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.280
They're going to have a mirror and a merger database.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.800
They're going to have more of an iOS inspired.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.320
It's not a direct three database,

13:47.320 --> 13:49.040
like one for one re-implementation

13:49.040 --> 13:51.920
of the iOS system, because there is just historical legacy

13:51.920 --> 13:53.280
things they have to support.

13:53.280 --> 13:57.040
But in a sense, they're going to be building into Firefox

13:57.040 --> 14:00.960
a shadow bookmarking system that will be kept syncing separately

14:00.960 --> 14:02.640
from your primary bookmarks.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.040
And that's where it will work out,

14:04.040 --> 14:08.160
like merging of conflicts or other issues

14:08.160 --> 14:09.920
that crop up when you're syncing bookmarks

14:09.920 --> 14:12.600
or adding new items or editing existing items.

14:12.600 --> 14:16.080
And that'll be happening much faster in the background.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.400
And it has a graceful way to get out

14:18.400 --> 14:21.040
when there's a conflict that it can't figure out.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.680
So then this is just sort of a new system being

14:23.680 --> 14:26.600
added, bolted on, that will take the same data

14:26.600 --> 14:27.680
and do better things with it.

14:27.680 --> 14:28.280
Yeah, exactly.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.600
And they're starting to roll it out in 61 and 62

14:30.600 --> 14:31.600
in different phases.

14:31.600 --> 14:34.520
I have those details linked in the show notes

14:34.520 --> 14:36.080
if you want to read the whole post.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.760
If you're a big Firefox fan and you're

14:37.760 --> 14:40.560
curious about this battle and why it's sort of been

14:40.560 --> 14:44.320
a little clunky, they even identify some of the issues

14:44.320 --> 14:45.720
that I thought I was just crazy.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.060
I thought these were just problems that I had.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.240
And now I'm seeing Mozilla just say,

14:49.240 --> 14:51.680
the list is pretty damning there, right?

14:51.680 --> 14:53.480
Like, yeah, it doesn't make you confident.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.880
No, bookmarks will be duplicated, lost, or reordered.

14:55.880 --> 14:58.920
I have absolutely experienced the reordered thing.

14:58.920 --> 15:01.280
And folders with different contents

15:01.280 --> 15:02.840
would get smushed together.

15:02.840 --> 15:05.080
New bookmarks wouldn't make their way to all devices,

15:05.080 --> 15:06.960
causing them to gradually fall out of sync.

15:06.960 --> 15:10.400
And moves would be partially or completely undone at times.

15:10.400 --> 15:10.960
There you go.

15:10.960 --> 15:11.640
Yeah, right?

15:11.640 --> 15:12.140
Wow.

15:12.140 --> 15:14.300
And I thought I was just using it wrong.

15:14.300 --> 15:16.000
And I thought Chrome did it a lot better.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.180
And that was one of the things that first drew me to Chrome.

15:18.180 --> 15:18.760
I went back.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.260
I feel like it's been pretty solid.

15:20.260 --> 15:22.640
But I've also kind of reduced how much I use bookmarks.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.920
Same, yeah.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.720
And I'm looking forward to these changes.

15:25.720 --> 15:26.760
Definitely you should check the article out.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.760
I thought it was a great level of there's

15:28.760 --> 15:30.240
a lot of technical details without too much.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.720
There's not a ton of code, but they

15:31.720 --> 15:33.640
talk about the advanced designs of the system.

15:33.640 --> 15:36.600
And it's also worth mentioning, recently I've

15:36.600 --> 15:38.640
gotten a little more critical about the way Mozilla

15:38.640 --> 15:39.280
communicates.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.720
It's very corporate heavy.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.160
And it's sort of a turnoff to, I think,

15:42.160 --> 15:44.280
a lot of members of the open source and free software

15:44.280 --> 15:44.920
communities.

15:44.920 --> 15:48.040
And so reading that, I'd say it was very clear.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.120
It was technical.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.640
Felt like it was written to us.

15:50.640 --> 15:51.560
I liked that a lot.

15:51.560 --> 15:52.720
I liked that.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.520
And if you want to go read that whole thing,

15:54.520 --> 15:57.440
go to linuxunplug.com slash 249, and we'll

15:57.440 --> 15:59.400
have a link in there.

15:59.400 --> 16:02.360
I've talked a lot on this show about LVFS

16:02.360 --> 16:04.480
and the whole firmware update mechanism

16:04.480 --> 16:08.240
that I first experienced on an XPS 13 running Fedora,

16:08.240 --> 16:10.440
and then later different distributions, including Arch.

16:10.440 --> 16:11.760
And it was just so exciting.

16:11.760 --> 16:12.960
Yeah, you're in the software updates.

16:12.960 --> 16:13.920
And you go to the updates, and it's like, what?

16:13.920 --> 16:14.840
There's a new firmware update?

16:14.840 --> 16:15.560
Crazy.

16:15.560 --> 16:16.960
And then we really saw the value

16:16.960 --> 16:19.920
of having that system when Spectre and Meltdown were

16:19.920 --> 16:21.040
announced.

16:21.040 --> 16:28.400
And this system, LVFS, it's a Red Hat project

16:28.400 --> 16:32.280
that is attempting to be distro and vendor neutral.

16:32.280 --> 16:33.600
We've covered a lot in the past.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.360
Richard Hughes is the primary developer behind it.

16:36.360 --> 16:37.880
I think he's done some great work.

16:37.880 --> 16:40.040
And I love the idea of something that's cross-vendor,

16:40.040 --> 16:42.480
so Lenovo or Dell could participate in it.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.800
And you can be on Arch, Fedora, or Ubuntu,

16:44.800 --> 16:46.200
and you're getting these firmware updates.

16:46.200 --> 16:46.680
Doesn't matter, yeah, right?

16:46.680 --> 16:47.640
Yeah, that's great.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.000
So I've always been a fan of, well,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.960
let's get LVFS in all of the places.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.480
And so that's why I think other people have felt that way too.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.040
And there was some interest in what was

16:57.040 --> 16:58.600
System76 going to be doing.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.480
Now that they have Pop!

16:59.480 --> 17:02.440
OS and that they'll be building their own hardware soon,

17:02.440 --> 17:05.720
what is their intention to participate in the LVFS

17:05.720 --> 17:06.600
program?

17:06.600 --> 17:08.480
And then it came out that in the background,

17:08.480 --> 17:11.480
there had been some communication between System76

17:11.480 --> 17:12.280
and the project.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.120
It's not like they weren't aware of it, right?

17:14.120 --> 17:14.600
Right.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.760
But nothing of major substance that

17:16.760 --> 17:18.720
had really progressed anything beyond like, hey,

17:18.720 --> 17:19.320
can we do this?

17:19.320 --> 17:20.120
How does this work?

17:20.120 --> 17:21.480
Things like that.

17:21.480 --> 17:24.760
And it seems like things just sort of faded out.

17:24.760 --> 17:26.920
There was some rumors that, yeah, they started talking

17:26.920 --> 17:31.720
to us from the LVFS camp, but we haven't heard anything.

17:31.720 --> 17:35.840
And then about a year went by, and Richard Hughes

17:35.840 --> 17:39.560
posted a blog post where the crux of it

17:39.560 --> 17:41.260
is this isn't going anywhere.

17:41.260 --> 17:42.800
They're not going to use our project.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.760
They're going to do their own update mechanism

17:44.760 --> 17:47.160
that they've created.

17:47.160 --> 17:51.040
And if you want somebody who supports LVFS,

17:51.040 --> 17:53.080
go get an XPS 13.

17:53.080 --> 17:56.520
And Carl took to the System76 blog

17:56.520 --> 18:00.000
and wrote a kind of line-by-line response where he says,

18:00.000 --> 18:02.120
we reached out to Richard over a year ago.

18:02.120 --> 18:05.360
We were enthusiastic about LVFS and interested in whether

18:05.360 --> 18:06.900
or not it would work for us.

18:06.900 --> 18:09.760
Once we described how we needed to deliver our firmware,

18:09.760 --> 18:11.760
we were told that it would not work well

18:11.760 --> 18:14.520
and would likely not be acceptable to Red Hat Legal.

18:14.520 --> 18:17.100
And they kind of post a snippet of the issue.

18:17.100 --> 18:18.520
Richard Hughes says, I don't think

18:18.520 --> 18:20.060
this will work for us because there's

18:20.060 --> 18:22.160
no way to reference a flashing tool in the XML

18:22.160 --> 18:25.120
or sign an executable on LVFS.

18:25.120 --> 18:27.840
I don't think Red Hat Legal will like the idea of shipping

18:27.840 --> 18:29.320
the flashing program.

18:29.320 --> 18:32.360
We've only ever talked about the firmware files themselves,

18:32.360 --> 18:35.600
although I can see the images in the.cap file

18:35.600 --> 18:38.000
probably contain firmware executable code wrapped up

18:38.000 --> 18:38.560
in layers.

18:38.560 --> 18:39.840
Yeah, fair enough.

18:39.840 --> 18:42.000
He says, I also know the Red Hat security team would

18:42.000 --> 18:43.840
do more than just blink when we tell them

18:43.840 --> 18:47.360
that we want to ship an untrusted, non-free binary,

18:47.360 --> 18:51.840
which would run as root on RHEL customer's machines.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.520
So that's the snippet of the conversation

18:53.520 --> 18:55.440
that way Richard Hughes says, I don't think

18:55.440 --> 18:56.960
this is going to work for you.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.880
It's kind of, I believe, at that point in the conversation,

18:59.880 --> 19:00.800
things just died off.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.340
System76 is like, well, obviously, this

19:02.340 --> 19:03.540
isn't going to work for us.

19:03.540 --> 19:05.520
We'll focus on what we need to focus on.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.560
They were also launching Pop OS around this time,

19:07.560 --> 19:10.260
and they have plenty of things that they're doing.

19:10.260 --> 19:12.720
And so he also, Carl mentions in his blog post

19:12.720 --> 19:17.960
that the update capital mechanism that LVFS uses

19:17.960 --> 19:19.840
wouldn't work for over a decade of machines

19:19.840 --> 19:22.200
that System76 has in the field.

19:22.200 --> 19:27.160
And without update capsule, and with update capsule as well,

19:27.160 --> 19:28.920
it wraps everything into binary blobs.

19:28.920 --> 19:31.920
You can't really pull it apart and reverse engineer firmwares,

19:31.920 --> 19:34.080
and they don't like that aspect of it as well.

19:34.080 --> 19:37.760
Carl outlines a few other concerns in his blog post,

19:37.760 --> 19:40.120
but I kind of wanted to reach out to Carl

19:40.120 --> 19:43.080
and ask him a couple of direct questions,

19:43.080 --> 19:45.000
because there's been some that I think

19:45.000 --> 19:46.360
have been rattling around the internet that we'd

19:46.360 --> 19:47.080
like answers to.

19:47.080 --> 19:50.040
So I sent Carl an email, and he got back to me this morning,

19:50.040 --> 19:51.080
pretty promptly, actually.

19:51.080 --> 19:54.920
And I asked him, I said, is one of the core problems

19:54.920 --> 19:59.160
with System76 using LVFS is that it's not really compatible

19:59.160 --> 20:02.840
with its upstream OEM agreements that System76 has in place,

20:02.840 --> 20:06.760
with say, Clevo or whoever that might be upselling the parts.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.920
Carl responds to that, System76 has no upstream agreements

20:09.920 --> 20:12.600
limiting anything we can do to deliver firmware

20:12.600 --> 20:13.360
to our customers.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.400
This is made up.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.920
We were told in the email we posted

20:15.920 --> 20:18.160
that LVFS would technically be incompatible

20:18.160 --> 20:20.560
and would likely not be acceptable to Red Hat legal.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.480
We needed to still provide the functionality,

20:22.480 --> 20:25.120
so we built our own tool, which I, OK.

20:25.120 --> 20:25.640
Fair enough.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.680
So he says that there isn't an agreement.

20:27.680 --> 20:28.680
There is no agreement in place that

20:28.680 --> 20:31.600
limits how they redistribute firmware, is what he said.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.840
And I said, just to clarify, if customers

20:33.840 --> 20:37.320
choose to buy a stock Ubuntu machine from System76, not one

20:37.320 --> 20:37.800
running Pop!

20:37.800 --> 20:39.760
OS, will they still get updated?

20:39.760 --> 20:41.560
He said, correct, any Ubuntu-based distro

20:41.560 --> 20:42.800
will work, of course.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.000
We also had customers use the update tool on Arch.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.640
Nice, yeah, OK.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.240
And I said, in the future, when you're

20:48.240 --> 20:51.200
building your own systems, like your own desktops,

20:51.200 --> 20:54.600
do you intend to use LVFS at that point?

20:54.600 --> 20:58.760
And he said that their first in-house design

20:58.760 --> 21:00.360
and manufactured desktop will feature

21:00.360 --> 21:01.760
open source firmware components.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.600
So they don't need to be reverse engineered,

21:03.600 --> 21:05.880
so the update capsule thing isn't.

21:05.880 --> 21:08.040
But they'll still use their existing infrastructure

21:08.040 --> 21:09.720
and tools to distribute the firmwares

21:09.720 --> 21:12.200
when they're building their own systems.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.680
And so I think it's pretty clear in here.

21:15.680 --> 21:19.000
This is just simply a matter of, this is what works for us.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.880
It wasn't really a statement on the LVFS project.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.600
It's just not a solution that's necessarily

21:23.600 --> 21:25.080
going to work for us right now.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.200
And he would have, I think, I got from my back and forth

21:28.200 --> 21:28.920
with him, he would have preferred

21:28.920 --> 21:31.640
to just leave it at that.

21:31.640 --> 21:32.400
Yeah, I mean.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.920
I wish there was a mechanism for these different groups

21:34.920 --> 21:36.600
to communicate better.

21:36.600 --> 21:39.200
It's funny, we have all these different platforms, Twitter,

21:39.200 --> 21:43.840
and email, and IRC, and Slack, and Telegram,

21:43.840 --> 21:45.960
that everybody in our community uses pretty regularly.

21:45.960 --> 21:48.960
And yet, like, these like.

21:48.960 --> 21:52.080
It feels like we end up talking past each other in blog posts.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.680
In blog posts, right?

21:53.680 --> 21:55.080
And I really respect Richard, too.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.080
I think what Richard is working on

21:57.080 --> 22:01.320
is really important for a first class Linux user experience,

22:01.320 --> 22:03.880
where you don't have to sit there and do the distro math

22:03.880 --> 22:05.920
and wonder if there's a PPA for that system.

22:05.920 --> 22:09.060
And you just know that if you get a modern system,

22:09.060 --> 22:10.640
when you go to get all your updates,

22:10.640 --> 22:11.400
you get your firmware update.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.280
I like that.

22:12.280 --> 22:12.960
I like that, too.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.160
And there's probably a lot of different ways

22:14.160 --> 22:16.440
System76 could crack that particular egg.

22:16.440 --> 22:20.080
And maybe they could deliver it that way as well.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.440
It's sort of unfortunate, though,

22:21.440 --> 22:23.740
that we end up getting these lobs thrown back and forth

22:23.740 --> 22:25.280
at each other.

22:25.280 --> 22:28.220
In another world, I almost would like to give people a.

22:28.220 --> 22:29.640
Maybe this is something we could do.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.600
I almost would like to give people a space

22:31.600 --> 22:33.880
to just talk it out.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.160
Because you get people talking, and it just is everything's

22:36.160 --> 22:36.160
fine.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.520
Let's hash it out now, and then not

22:37.520 --> 22:38.440
have to keep talking about it.

22:38.440 --> 22:40.120
And we can stop covering it on the show,

22:40.120 --> 22:41.520
and everyone will be happier.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.400
Yeah, it just seems like that would be a lot nicer.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.920
Do you think there's any, was there any in the reaction,

22:45.920 --> 22:48.840
any sort of open source community frustration

22:48.840 --> 22:49.760
just with Pop!

22:49.760 --> 22:52.200
OS, or feelings about that System76

22:52.200 --> 22:54.720
may be motivated to do this for some of their not

22:54.720 --> 22:56.680
appreciating forking when they don't need you?

22:56.680 --> 22:57.880
That's an interesting question.

22:57.880 --> 23:00.320
Yeah, I think that is a bit of it.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.600
I think where Richard Hughes comes in is,

23:02.600 --> 23:04.200
I saw some of his follow up comments on Google+.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.880
He's a little disappointed, because the idea here

23:06.880 --> 23:10.480
is this is sort of like the community thing to do.

23:10.480 --> 23:14.880
This is the Linux, this is like a good Linux hardware citizen

23:14.880 --> 23:17.360
thing to do, I think is the thinking.

23:17.360 --> 23:19.640
And so there was a level of disappointment on his part

23:19.640 --> 23:21.760
that System76 wasn't interested in participating

23:21.760 --> 23:25.360
in that larger ecosystem, even if it meant sort of reinventing

23:25.360 --> 23:26.000
the wheel a bit.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.080
Because some other manufacturers are redoing the way

23:29.080 --> 23:32.400
that they do all of this process too.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.360
And I think that is a point you could argue.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.320
Maybe that's not necessarily true.

23:37.320 --> 23:40.240
Because perhaps you could argue that LVFS

23:40.240 --> 23:42.800
is not as independent as it would need

23:42.800 --> 23:44.520
to be for that to actually happen.

23:44.520 --> 23:48.200
It also strikes me that it's great that System76 is taking

23:48.200 --> 23:48.840
this seriously.

23:48.840 --> 23:52.120
And maybe if a lot of other vendors had been doing this,

23:52.120 --> 23:54.280
yes, it would be a worse world where we had a whole bunch

23:54.280 --> 23:56.720
of independent Linux flashing programs.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.440
But imagine that, if for years you'd

23:58.440 --> 24:01.280
be able to easily flash firmware from whatever big name vendor,

24:01.280 --> 24:03.160
that just wasn't the world that we lived in.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.120
It's cool that it's changing now.

24:04.120 --> 24:05.480
But I can understand why they're like,

24:05.480 --> 24:07.440
guys, we've been shipping this for like 10 years.

24:07.440 --> 24:09.480
We just have to support our machines.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.840
Yeah, the machines we already have in the field.

24:11.840 --> 24:13.800
Let's take a moment and thank Linux Academy,

24:13.800 --> 24:16.160
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

24:16.160 --> 24:19.520
Go there and sign up for a free seven-day trial of a platform

24:19.520 --> 24:21.680
that's built to teach you more about Linux,

24:21.680 --> 24:24.060
with full-time human beings that can help you whenever you

24:24.060 --> 24:24.760
get stuck.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.060
And when you're not asking them questions,

24:26.060 --> 24:28.800
they're always improving, adding, and updating content.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.100
They have a course scheduler that

24:30.100 --> 24:33.120
works with your busy schedule and helps set learning goals

24:33.120 --> 24:35.040
and then helps you stick to those time frames.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.800
They have cloud servers that they spin up on demand

24:37.800 --> 24:40.000
when you need them as part of the courseware.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.560
You can SSH into those systems, and they're really cool.

24:42.560 --> 24:45.000
You can set the distro, and the courseware matches that.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.880
And they also have practice exams and quizzes

24:46.880 --> 24:49.400
to help prepare you for certifications and tests

24:49.400 --> 24:51.860
to make sure you really have learned what you think you've

24:51.860 --> 24:53.800
learned before you go take the big test.

24:53.800 --> 24:54.640
Yeah.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.400
They also have iOS and Android apps

24:56.400 --> 24:58.120
so you can study while you're going.

24:58.120 --> 24:59.960
They have lesson audio and study guides

24:59.960 --> 25:01.580
that you can download and take with you.

25:01.580 --> 25:04.120
And they have rolled out a big batch of content

25:04.120 --> 25:06.600
in the last month, and it's still coming, too.

25:06.600 --> 25:07.400
It's impressive.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.600
There's so much to cover that they've

25:08.600 --> 25:10.280
been doing live streams and just trying to bring everybody

25:10.280 --> 25:12.920
up to date on all of this stuff, because it's so much,

25:12.920 --> 25:14.280
it's hard to keep track of how much.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.080
You don't even want to read all the stuff

25:15.080 --> 25:17.560
that they have just offered, let alone all the actual material.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.360
Yes, and they're updating old stuff as well,

25:19.360 --> 25:21.000
so the old material is staying current.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.360
It's a great, great service.

25:23.360 --> 25:25.240
And you can try it seven days for free.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.800
But when you go to linuxacademy.com slash

25:27.800 --> 25:30.240

25:30.240 --> 25:33.320
and support the show, linuxacademy.com slash

25:33.320 --> 25:34.480
unplugged.

25:34.480 --> 25:36.720
Bubba-dubba, bubba-dubba, bubba-dubba, bubba-dubba.

25:36.720 --> 25:37.680
I like that sound effect.

25:37.680 --> 25:38.360
I like that, too.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.120
You should keep it going.

25:40.120 --> 25:43.240
So if I say GS Connect, does it ring a bell?

25:43.240 --> 25:44.880
Does that ring a bell at all, GS Connect?

25:44.880 --> 25:47.440
Well, it does make me think of KDE Connect.

25:47.440 --> 25:48.560
You got it, Wes.

25:48.560 --> 25:49.560
That's right.

25:49.560 --> 25:54.800
It is the gnome shell implementation of KDE Connect.

25:54.800 --> 25:55.880
Yeah, without the Qt.

25:55.880 --> 25:56.680
I'm interested.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.760
No Qt or KDE dependencies.

25:58.760 --> 26:02.360
And KDE Connect, of course, is that awesome, awesome tool

26:02.360 --> 26:05.840
that allows you to basically make your Android phone

26:05.840 --> 26:08.480
a companion to your Plasma desktop

26:08.480 --> 26:10.560
and now your gnome desktop with GS Connect.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.160
You can share clipboards.

26:12.160 --> 26:14.480
You can get notifications moved between them.

26:14.480 --> 26:16.000
You can use it as a remote control.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.400
I mean, you could transfer files.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.920
There's a lot of stuff.

26:18.920 --> 26:21.800
And you've got to figure, it's a feature

26:21.800 --> 26:23.840
that Microsoft is eyeing.

26:23.840 --> 26:25.960
They've talked a little bit at Build

26:25.960 --> 26:29.480
about the new timeline feature in Windows 10

26:29.480 --> 26:31.520
that requires a special launcher on Android

26:31.520 --> 26:33.560
to make it all work, where none of this

26:33.560 --> 26:35.560
is required with GS Connect.

26:35.560 --> 26:38.480
And so this guy, this random guy, Will Cook,

26:38.480 --> 26:41.760
some guy on the internet, he has proposed

26:41.760 --> 26:47.080
that Ubuntu should integrate GS Connect as part of 18.10.

26:47.080 --> 26:48.080
I think it's a great idea.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.240
That's awesome.

26:49.240 --> 26:51.280
And so he's put out there for conversation

26:51.280 --> 26:53.240
on the Ubuntu community portal hub.

26:53.240 --> 26:54.240
What do we call it, Popey?

26:54.240 --> 26:55.200
Is it hub?

26:55.200 --> 26:55.680
Hub.

26:55.680 --> 26:56.400
Hub.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.560
And asked for folks to give input

26:58.560 --> 27:01.040
and has even named people that are volunteering

27:01.040 --> 27:02.840
to do some of the work.

27:02.840 --> 27:04.800
I think this would be a great and useful tool.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.760
And it'd be a nice feature on the side of the box

27:06.760 --> 27:07.840
like they used to say.

27:07.840 --> 27:08.680
That sounds awesome.

27:08.680 --> 27:10.520
Yeah, I mean, I would certainly use it.

27:10.520 --> 27:12.520
So if you want to get in on the conversation around that,

27:12.520 --> 27:14.080
I'll have a link in the show notes.

27:14.080 --> 27:17.960
And then a little birdie dropped off, a new snap.

27:17.960 --> 27:18.480
New snap?

27:18.480 --> 27:19.840
Right on the doorstep of the show this morning.

27:19.840 --> 27:19.840
What is it?

27:19.840 --> 27:20.840
I'm dying to know.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.160
Well, you know how we're big fans of the FFmpeg project.

27:23.160 --> 27:23.840
Oh, love it.

27:23.840 --> 27:25.500
And you know what FFmpeg could always

27:25.500 --> 27:27.200
use a little more of?

27:27.200 --> 27:28.920
Hardware acceleration.

27:28.920 --> 27:29.600
Always.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.160
But you can't do that in a snap, right, Wimpy?

27:31.160 --> 27:32.080
That's not possible.

27:32.080 --> 27:32.920
It is now.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.640
Oh, boy.

27:34.640 --> 27:35.440
Dish.

27:35.440 --> 27:36.520
You got a dish.

27:36.520 --> 27:40.200
So this is something we've had brewing for a little while.

27:40.200 --> 27:43.360
You will have heard Poppy and I talking about the fact

27:43.360 --> 27:47.440
that OBS is able to use an accelerated FFmpeg that's

27:47.440 --> 27:50.560
in the Ubuntu 18.04 archive, which is terrific.

27:50.560 --> 27:54.160
So people who want NVENC and HEVC and what have you,

27:54.160 --> 27:55.800
that's all available.

27:55.800 --> 28:01.800
But as is common, the 18.04 release comes out.

28:01.800 --> 28:05.040
We're shipping the latest stable release of FFmpeg

28:05.040 --> 28:08.360
and then days later, FFmpeg 4 drops.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.240
And we've now got an 18.04 release,

28:10.240 --> 28:13.800
which is never going to see that new version of FFmpeg.

28:13.800 --> 28:18.000
So what we've been working on is a snap of FFmpeg,

28:18.000 --> 28:24.240
which is FFmpeg 4 with the NVENC and HEVC pieces enabled.

28:24.240 --> 28:27.000
So you have the hardware acceleration.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.600
We've also done the work to build in the VA API stuff.

28:31.600 --> 28:35.560
So there's a hardware accelerated encoding and decoding

28:35.560 --> 28:38.360
for Intel and AMD as well.

28:38.360 --> 28:41.840
And all of the bits that FFmpeg relies on

28:41.840 --> 28:46.680
are all built from the current versions of source parts.

28:46.680 --> 28:50.160
So the whole stack of FFmpeg is all the latest stuff

28:50.160 --> 28:51.880
inside the snap.

28:51.880 --> 28:56.400
That snap is currently classic because it's FFmpeg itself.

28:56.400 --> 29:00.280
And it sort of makes sense that maybe FFmpeg, the tool,

29:00.280 --> 29:02.760
should remain a classic snap because there's

29:02.760 --> 29:06.440
many different ways people would want to use it.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.560
But that snaps only 20 meg.

29:08.560 --> 29:09.720
So it's very small.

29:09.720 --> 29:10.640
Wow.

29:10.640 --> 29:11.440
Yeah.

29:11.440 --> 29:12.400
I'm really excited to try it.

29:12.400 --> 29:13.920
I could take that anyway.

29:13.920 --> 29:14.520
Yeah.

29:14.520 --> 29:18.920
And what we've been doing is we've figured out

29:18.920 --> 29:27.760
how to confine FFmpeg and open up access to the NVENC socket.

29:27.760 --> 29:32.440
And what this will enable us to do is, in snaps like OBS

29:32.440 --> 29:38.680
and Kdenlive, embed the bleeding edge versions of FFmpeg

29:38.680 --> 29:42.080
with all of the acceleration turned on inside those

29:42.080 --> 29:43.040
applications.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.720
So they don't have to go looking at the host, which

29:45.720 --> 29:47.640
may have an old version.

29:47.640 --> 29:50.200
They can have the current latest versions

29:50.200 --> 29:52.080
with all of the acceleration features.

29:52.080 --> 29:52.720
Right.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.200
Boy, that's going to be great for them.

29:54.200 --> 29:55.040
This is incredible.

29:55.040 --> 29:58.240
And they'll know exactly that everywhere that it ships

29:58.240 --> 30:00.360
will have that version of FFmpeg, which is going

30:00.360 --> 30:01.600
to be great for Kdenlive.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.520
Maybe that's one of the biggest challenges

30:03.520 --> 30:05.240
for doing video editing on Linux is

30:05.240 --> 30:07.120
that people have different parts underneath

30:07.120 --> 30:08.120
of different versions.

30:08.120 --> 30:09.800
And so you can say, my Kdenlive crashes.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.900
And it comes back with, OK, what version of this

30:11.900 --> 30:13.440
and what version of that do you have?

30:13.440 --> 30:14.520
And this solves that.

30:14.520 --> 30:17.080
That's available now in the stable channel.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.120
In the future, we'll be doing a bit more

30:19.120 --> 30:21.080
with the Intel and AMD acceleration.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.320
And a little project I'm interested in looking at

30:23.320 --> 30:27.560
is we've now got the capability within snaps

30:27.560 --> 30:31.360
when they're being built to make architecture decisions

30:31.360 --> 30:32.560
in the build process.

30:32.560 --> 30:36.280
So you can say, when I'm on an AMD 64 machine,

30:36.280 --> 30:40.720
do these things differently than when I'm on a ARM device.

30:40.720 --> 30:42.960
And what I'm planning to do is bring some work

30:42.960 --> 30:46.240
I did on the Raspberry Pi last year,

30:46.240 --> 30:49.320
where I made an FFmpeg that was specifically

30:49.320 --> 30:52.160
tuned for hardware accelerated encoding and decoding

30:52.160 --> 30:55.840
on the Raspberry Pi, bring that into the same snap

30:55.840 --> 30:58.640
so that when you're building on ARM HF,

30:58.640 --> 31:01.040
it automatically turns on all of those Raspberry Pi

31:01.040 --> 31:02.680
optimizations.

31:02.680 --> 31:05.760
So the same snap will be the accelerated version

31:05.760 --> 31:07.280
for the different devices.

31:07.280 --> 31:11.520
You are doing the work of many editors out there.

31:11.520 --> 31:13.520
They are going to appreciate that very, very much.

31:13.520 --> 31:15.160
They're going to save so many folks time

31:15.160 --> 31:16.400
that would have had to figure out

31:16.400 --> 31:18.040
how to get that working individually

31:18.040 --> 31:19.000
on each one of their systems.

31:19.000 --> 31:19.000
Right.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.480
Can you mention the different, like just a couple of years

31:20.480 --> 31:22.360
ago, trying to put that all together.

31:22.360 --> 31:25.600
Maybe you're manually compiling things or with sketchy PPAs,

31:25.600 --> 31:27.640
and now it's just a couple of snaps.

31:27.640 --> 31:28.960
Yep.

31:28.960 --> 31:31.360
OK, so while we're on this subject of snaps,

31:31.360 --> 31:33.560
there's a big story floating around, huge story,

31:33.560 --> 31:36.160
massive controversy, shaking everything to its core.

31:36.160 --> 31:37.240
So big.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.360
There was malware found in the Snap Store.

31:39.360 --> 31:43.280
And as a response, there has been a post up on the blog.abuntu.com

31:43.280 --> 31:45.760
talking about future steps that will

31:45.760 --> 31:49.440
be taken to secure, to a degree, the Snap Store.

31:49.440 --> 31:52.400
And there was one bit in here that really jumped out at me.

31:52.400 --> 31:53.800
And Will Cook talked a little bit

31:53.800 --> 31:56.200
about this on the recent Late Night Linux, too.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.800
They say, on the roadmap, they have an interesting security

31:58.800 --> 32:00.400
feature in the works that will improve

32:00.400 --> 32:02.120
the safety of the system and also

32:02.120 --> 32:03.480
the experience of people handling

32:03.480 --> 32:06.560
software deployments in servers and desktops.

32:06.560 --> 32:09.240
A simple but fairly effective feature that we are working on

32:09.240 --> 32:13.320
is the ability to flag specific publishers as verified.

32:13.320 --> 32:14.520
OK.

32:14.520 --> 32:16.240
The details of that will be announced soon.

32:16.240 --> 32:18.360
But the basic idea is that it's easy for users

32:18.360 --> 32:20.800
to identify that the person or organization publishing

32:20.800 --> 32:25.880
that Snap are who they claim to be.

32:25.880 --> 32:28.960
And so, though, would that have solved this?

32:28.960 --> 32:29.720
So what happened?

32:29.720 --> 32:30.840
So let me back up a little bit.

32:30.840 --> 32:31.920
Yeah, lay it down.

32:31.920 --> 32:35.160
There was a video game in the Snap Store,

32:35.160 --> 32:37.480
I think it claimed to be a version of that 2048 game

32:37.480 --> 32:38.520
everybody loves.

32:38.520 --> 32:40.480
And when you get that there game,

32:40.480 --> 32:42.560
it was actually doing a little crypto mining

32:42.560 --> 32:44.520
in the background, surprise, surprise.

32:44.520 --> 32:47.320
Well, of course, that's what you got to do these days.

32:47.320 --> 32:49.760
So it's an interesting use of, I guess,

32:49.760 --> 32:51.400
what you could call malware.

32:51.400 --> 32:55.280
It was really more like crypto ware.

32:55.280 --> 32:57.000
Because it's in this confined Snap,

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
but it can still use your CPU resources and do mining.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.520
Just raises your power bill.

33:01.520 --> 33:03.020
Yeah, so it's behaving in a way that

33:03.020 --> 33:04.880
was unexpected to the user.

33:04.880 --> 33:07.600
But they could have been a verified publisher.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.080
Right.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.160
And with the verification, does that speak at all

33:10.160 --> 33:11.640
to the procedures?

33:11.640 --> 33:13.060
How do they keep their keys?

33:13.060 --> 33:15.080
All those sorts of things that would actually also impact.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.720
Yeah, maybe we'll get details on that.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.760
But that's about as much as I know.

33:18.760 --> 33:20.640
I'm sure our friends Popeye or Wimpy

33:20.640 --> 33:23.560
would have more insights on this particular topic.

33:23.560 --> 33:27.200
It's been kind of interesting, but it all

33:27.200 --> 33:29.160
could have been more of a shitstorm.

33:29.160 --> 33:33.200
It's been kind of a mild shitstorm, but not that bad.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.240
So what's been the piece that people have missed?

33:35.240 --> 33:36.680
What is the definition of a mild shitstorm?

33:36.680 --> 33:37.120
Well, I don't know.

33:37.120 --> 33:38.160
From where I've sat, I could have

33:38.160 --> 33:39.280
seen it could have been a lot worse.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.160
But you were more at the heart of the storm.

33:41.160 --> 33:43.400
So I'm curious if you have the same impression.

33:43.400 --> 33:46.440
So whenever something like this happens,

33:46.440 --> 33:49.280
and I'm not talking about whenever we regularly

33:49.280 --> 33:50.560
get malware arriving.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.760
I'm talking about whenever there's

33:52.760 --> 33:57.520
a problem in Ubuntu, and we see the community reacting

33:57.520 --> 34:01.240
in some way, we all jump to it.

34:01.240 --> 34:04.480
And there are people, you could think of the Avengers

34:04.480 --> 34:07.480
around the world, all coming together in order

34:07.480 --> 34:09.280
to resolve this problem.

34:09.280 --> 34:14.000
And I know that a whole bunch of people in Canonical

34:14.000 --> 34:16.400
care very deeply about this problem,

34:16.400 --> 34:17.400
wanted to get it solved.

34:17.400 --> 34:20.160
So someone alerted us to the fact

34:20.160 --> 34:23.240
that there was an application in the store,

34:23.240 --> 34:25.280
and the application did something

34:25.280 --> 34:28.040
other than what it said it did in the description.

34:28.040 --> 34:29.720
That's effectively what it was.

34:29.720 --> 34:30.600
It's as simple as that.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.760
Someone said, this is a game.

34:32.760 --> 34:34.880
It's 2048 or Hextris.

34:34.880 --> 34:39.200
There was actually half a dozen, four or five applications

34:39.200 --> 34:42.280
from the same author, and they all did the same thing.

34:42.280 --> 34:45.520
They were, in inverted commas, masquerading as one thing,

34:45.520 --> 34:47.800
but doing something else.

34:47.800 --> 34:48.880
They weren't stealing data.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.440
They weren't grabbing data off your machine

34:51.440 --> 34:53.240
and sending it off to some third party.

34:53.240 --> 34:55.720
They were basically using your CPU in order

34:55.720 --> 34:58.840
to mine some kind of cryptocurrency.

34:58.840 --> 35:01.640
And at the point when we found out about this,

35:01.640 --> 35:04.600
I think it was early on a Saturday morning,

35:04.600 --> 35:07.880
the weekend just gone, and I was standing in a field

35:07.880 --> 35:09.320
watching my son play football.

35:09.320 --> 35:12.560
I know Martin was in the middle of a forest with his family.

35:12.560 --> 35:14.560
Other people were spending time with their families

35:14.560 --> 35:17.680
on a Saturday morning, and everyone jumped to it.

35:17.680 --> 35:21.200
Telegram lit up, IRC channels lit up.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.240
We all jumped on it.

35:22.240 --> 35:23.960
We all pinged all the right people,

35:23.960 --> 35:26.560
phoned the emergency numbers, and made sure

35:26.560 --> 35:28.720
that those applications were yanked from the store

35:28.720 --> 35:30.040
as soon as possible.

35:30.040 --> 35:34.360
So we did exactly the right thing as soon as we were alerted

35:34.360 --> 35:36.680
or as soon as we figured out that there was something wrong.

35:36.680 --> 35:38.600
We pulled these apps from the stores,

35:38.600 --> 35:43.280
and then started a plan of investigation

35:43.280 --> 35:46.280
and debugging what the applications were actually

35:46.280 --> 35:51.560
doing to make sure that this doesn't happen again.

35:51.560 --> 35:53.960
And we can plan for the future to make sure

35:53.960 --> 35:56.480
that people are more aware of what's going on.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.760
Yeah, and so do you think this verified program would

35:58.760 --> 36:00.360
have fixed this particular problem,

36:00.360 --> 36:02.360
since he did have a few other apps in the store?

36:02.360 --> 36:04.680
He may have been considered verified at that point, no?

36:04.680 --> 36:07.920
Well, the verified, there is no verified program at the moment.

36:07.920 --> 36:11.040
So I couldn't possibly say if it would or wouldn't fix it,

36:11.040 --> 36:13.720
because I don't know what form that verified program will

36:13.720 --> 36:14.360
take.

36:14.360 --> 36:17.240
We've discussed this a number of times at Canonical,

36:17.240 --> 36:20.440
and it was most recently raised a couple of weeks ago.

36:20.440 --> 36:25.120
The Snap team were at a sprint recently.

36:25.120 --> 36:27.760
And it's a hard problem to solve.

36:27.760 --> 36:30.240
It's not straightforward.

36:30.240 --> 36:33.440
Even if you have someone who is, whether they are verified

36:33.440 --> 36:35.160
or they're not, it's not a magic bullet

36:35.160 --> 36:38.520
that stops someone from doing something nefarious.

36:38.520 --> 36:40.760
You have to be able to keep an eye on these things,

36:40.760 --> 36:44.160
monitor what's going on, and react fast

36:44.160 --> 36:46.120
when things do go wrong.

36:46.120 --> 36:50.360
If you look at any of the other app stores, Windows Mobile App

36:50.360 --> 36:53.040
Store, iOS App Store, Mac App Store, Windows Desktop App

36:53.040 --> 36:54.960
Store, Android App Store, they've all

36:54.960 --> 36:57.560
had some kind of occasion that something

36:57.560 --> 37:03.240
has been put in the store that users might feel aggrieved at,

37:03.240 --> 37:04.240
in one way or another.

37:04.240 --> 37:07.720
Whether it's too many pop-up adverts or crypto

37:07.720 --> 37:12.080
mining or something else, everyone's

37:12.080 --> 37:16.600
had this with a rite of passage for any app store.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.080
We've hit that now.

37:19.080 --> 37:21.080
And yeah, we're going to have to come up

37:21.080 --> 37:25.560
with ways in which we can ensure that users have confidence

37:25.560 --> 37:28.520
that the applications that are coming from the developers,

37:28.520 --> 37:30.160
they can have some level of confidence

37:30.160 --> 37:33.480
that that's a valid application.

37:33.480 --> 37:35.640
One thing that we're trying to do with the Snap Store

37:35.640 --> 37:39.560
is not that you should trust us, Canonical or Ubuntu,

37:39.560 --> 37:41.480
is that you should trust the developer.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.040
It's the developer who's pushing their stuff in the store.

37:44.040 --> 37:47.320
The code is coming from their GitHub repository.

37:47.320 --> 37:49.320
You should be able to go and have a look at their GitHub

37:49.320 --> 37:50.440
repository.

37:50.440 --> 37:52.200
You should be able to interrogate the Snap

37:52.200 --> 37:55.200
and figure out where did this come from, who made it,

37:55.200 --> 37:56.440
what's inside it.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.360
You should be confident that the thing you're

37:58.360 --> 38:01.140
installing on your computer is what it says it is.

38:01.140 --> 38:02.720
And we've got some work to do there,

38:02.720 --> 38:06.680
because right now, we don't make it obvious where

38:06.680 --> 38:08.920
the source of the Snap came from.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.300
So there's certainly some things we can do to improve.

38:11.300 --> 38:13.600
Maybe verification will help as well.

38:13.600 --> 38:16.880
Yeah, it obviously will be a process.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.880
I'm curious to see when the details come out.

38:18.880 --> 38:22.280
Congrats on being a real software store now.

38:22.280 --> 38:24.080
Yeah, it is a challenge, especially

38:24.080 --> 38:26.120
if you're going to allow submissions

38:26.120 --> 38:29.600
from the general public, which you can kind of offset

38:29.600 --> 38:32.240
to a degree by the fact that they are contained or confined,

38:32.240 --> 38:33.240
I guess I should say.

38:33.240 --> 38:33.720
Right.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.280
And the other thing is, it's worth

38:35.280 --> 38:39.520
noting that when we reacted, we reacted really fast,

38:39.520 --> 38:42.040
like faster than most stores react.

38:42.040 --> 38:45.060
So when we were told, within a couple of hours,

38:45.060 --> 38:48.420
it's yanked from the store, so no new users

38:48.420 --> 38:51.240
could download that application, what we also did

38:51.240 --> 38:55.080
was made sure that any users who currently had the application,

38:55.080 --> 38:57.160
we pushed out an update to those users

38:57.160 --> 38:59.500
that removed the component.

38:59.500 --> 39:02.160
That's still in progress, that removes the component

39:02.160 --> 39:04.200
that does the nefarious stuff.

39:04.200 --> 39:08.560
So they end up with the game and not the malware

39:08.560 --> 39:10.660
that came along with it.

39:10.660 --> 39:16.360
So we didn't just leave that software on people's computers,

39:16.360 --> 39:19.000
but equally, we didn't reach out to everyone's computers

39:19.000 --> 39:21.800
and delete the software from their computers.

39:21.800 --> 39:26.000
It's a fine line to walk between saying,

39:26.000 --> 39:29.580
well, you made the choice to install this software tough,

39:29.580 --> 39:34.240
and the Amazon way, which was to reach out to people's Kindles

39:34.240 --> 39:36.320
and delete a book from your Kindle.

39:36.320 --> 39:37.440
We didn't want to do that.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.400
We wanted to leave the software, but remove

39:39.400 --> 39:40.280
the bit that was bad.

39:40.280 --> 39:45.760
So it was a very delicate line and balance to walk.

39:45.760 --> 39:48.280
Yeah, I hadn't thought about that.

39:48.280 --> 39:50.120
I'm glad you mentioned that.

39:50.120 --> 39:52.840
So now, we wait for the details down the road.

39:52.840 --> 39:55.040
I appreciate that little tidbit about verify.

39:55.040 --> 39:56.920
I think that is a good idea.

39:56.920 --> 39:59.800
I mean, it shows that these are concerns that

39:59.800 --> 40:01.480
take it seriously, and that goes a long way.

40:01.480 --> 40:04.020
Some of the developers that have applications in the store,

40:04.020 --> 40:06.620
we have one-to-one relationships with.

40:06.620 --> 40:08.760
So some of the applications, like those

40:08.760 --> 40:13.180
which are classic snaps, like many of the popular code

40:13.180 --> 40:17.160
editors and things like Skype, people

40:17.160 --> 40:19.080
are a little bit concerned they're classic snaps.

40:19.080 --> 40:21.160
Being a classic snap, it means it has full access

40:21.160 --> 40:24.220
to your system, very much like a dev does

40:24.220 --> 40:25.800
when it's being installed.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.480
And so people have a little concern there.

40:27.480 --> 40:33.200
And we go through a vetting process for classic snaps,

40:33.200 --> 40:37.500
where we vet the developer who has access to the snap

40:37.500 --> 40:41.640
and make sure it correlates to the upstream developer who

40:41.640 --> 40:42.640
owns the application.

40:42.640 --> 40:46.320
So there's additional scrutiny applied to classic snaps?

40:46.320 --> 40:49.760
We already do that scrutiny for classic snaps.

40:49.760 --> 40:52.720
And perhaps that will be part of what

40:52.720 --> 40:55.400
we do for our further verification process.

40:55.400 --> 40:57.160
But like I say, we haven't figured out

40:57.160 --> 40:58.800
the details of any of it.

40:58.800 --> 41:01.600
Well, thank you for sharing that insight.

41:01.600 --> 41:04.140
It's very interesting here for the behind-the-scenes aspect

41:04.140 --> 41:05.520
of watching it from the outside.

41:05.520 --> 41:08.400
Of course, people jumped on the bandwagon, but you're right.

41:08.400 --> 41:10.640
It is almost a rite of passage to a degree.

41:10.640 --> 41:13.920
And it's not necessarily even a new type of threat vector.

41:13.920 --> 41:17.120
We've had rando repositories that people

41:17.120 --> 41:19.040
have been adding to their sources list for years,

41:19.040 --> 41:20.840
PPAs that you plug into a system.

41:20.840 --> 41:22.240
I think there's always just going to be this conflict,

41:22.240 --> 41:22.440
right?

41:22.440 --> 41:24.280
It's either you have a super-lockdown store

41:24.280 --> 41:25.720
where you don't have all the apps you want,

41:25.720 --> 41:28.280
or it's easy to publish new software, and it's great,

41:28.280 --> 41:29.520
and there are just more risks.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.000
Yeah.

41:30.000 --> 41:33.240
And the verified step, and perhaps others, will help.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.240
All right.

41:34.240 --> 41:36.800
Well, I want to move on to our friends

41:36.800 --> 41:40.760
over at the Plasma Camp, who were doing a little get-together

41:40.760 --> 41:42.360
in Berlin, Germany.

41:42.360 --> 41:44.320
And some of the folks there gathered to discuss the

41:44.320 --> 41:48.840
forthcoming 5.13 release, and of course, the future of Plasma

41:48.840 --> 41:49.800
and Wayland itself.

41:49.800 --> 41:54.360
But this time, with a twist, one of the members of the Sway

41:54.360 --> 41:58.840
Window Manager team joined them to talk Wayland input methods

41:58.840 --> 42:00.040
and a bunch of other things.

42:00.040 --> 42:02.120
It looks like there was some really fruitful stuff coming

42:02.120 --> 42:02.800
out of this.

42:02.800 --> 42:06.560
Drew Devault, the lead developer of the Sway Window Manager,

42:06.560 --> 42:08.720
joined the Plasma Sprint to discuss where Wayland

42:08.720 --> 42:11.400
protocols could be shared between the projects.

42:11.400 --> 42:12.080
Wow.

42:12.080 --> 42:12.680
Right?

42:12.680 --> 42:13.600
Brilliant.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.480
The team looked at their layer protocol,

42:15.480 --> 42:18.800
which covers much of the work of the current plasma shell

42:18.800 --> 42:19.800
protocol.

42:19.800 --> 42:22.160
We found that this protocol contained some nice ideas

42:22.160 --> 42:25.080
and suggested some improvements for the Sway Window Manager

42:25.080 --> 42:26.280
developers as well.

42:26.280 --> 42:29.600
The plasma output management protocol was also discussed.

42:29.600 --> 42:30.840
Now, get this thing.

42:30.840 --> 42:33.680
This protocol defines how external monitors are used.

42:33.680 --> 42:36.120
And Sway currently just reloads config files.

42:36.120 --> 42:39.320
So the Sway team is going to consider using the plasma

42:39.320 --> 42:42.800
output management protocol so the two projects are using the

42:42.800 --> 42:44.640
same thing for external monitors.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.560
That would be nice.

42:46.560 --> 42:49.560
This alleviates some of my big concerns I have about the path

42:49.560 --> 42:50.080
to Wayland.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.480
And I'm really glad to see this.

42:51.480 --> 42:54.400
There was also some talks about remote access

42:54.400 --> 42:56.440
and using pipewire, because that's

42:56.440 --> 42:57.640
the route the plasma's taking.

42:57.640 --> 42:57.640
Right.

42:57.640 --> 42:59.320
This is exactly the thing that we were like, well,

42:59.320 --> 43:00.760
probably we'll need this in Wayland.

43:00.760 --> 43:01.800
And it's happening.

43:01.800 --> 43:02.760
So that's good.

43:02.760 --> 43:03.840
It's really good.

43:03.840 --> 43:08.440
They also had some new work on the new input stack for Qt,

43:08.440 --> 43:10.240
because there was a bunch of other developers

43:10.240 --> 43:11.200
there as well.

43:11.200 --> 43:14.000
And Sean, I think I'm going to butcher this.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.800
Rutledge, going to go for that.

43:15.800 --> 43:16.540
What do you think?

43:16.540 --> 43:19.160
Yeah, I think this time you got it right.

43:19.160 --> 43:21.440
Yeah, well, he's the lead developer of Qt's new input

43:21.440 --> 43:23.560
stack, and he joined the sprint for a few days

43:23.560 --> 43:27.000
to work on and review the new API.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.160
And this is really all about putting Wayland first.

43:29.160 --> 43:34.040
And they said they got some nice parts in that were improved,

43:34.040 --> 43:36.200
and things went surprisingly smooth.

43:36.200 --> 43:39.920
And the plasma browser integration got final touches

43:39.920 --> 43:42.600
for 5.13, which will be released next month.

43:42.600 --> 43:44.600
Now, the plasma browser integration

43:44.600 --> 43:47.720
means that Firefox and Chrome and Chromium browsers

43:47.720 --> 43:50.760
will use Plasma's file transfer widget for downloads

43:50.760 --> 43:52.420
and the native plasma notifications

43:52.420 --> 43:53.920
for browser notifications.

43:53.920 --> 43:58.280
And more importantly for me, the media controls in your task

43:58.280 --> 44:00.840
manager will work for browser tabs and stuff,

44:00.840 --> 44:01.640
so you can mute.

44:01.640 --> 44:04.080
Oh, love that plasma manager.

44:04.080 --> 44:05.120
It's nice.

44:05.120 --> 44:06.920
So lots of stuff there.

44:06.920 --> 44:10.840
Translations as well getting fixed up, other kinds of things,

44:10.840 --> 44:13.880
and some work on the Falcon web browser

44:13.880 --> 44:17.160
and getting it feature parity in terms of plasma integration

44:17.160 --> 44:18.320
like the other browsers.

44:18.320 --> 44:22.040
So some good stuff coming out of the plasma sprint in Berlin.

44:22.040 --> 44:23.280
It's nice to see that.

44:23.280 --> 44:25.200
Huge, huge fan now these days.

44:25.200 --> 44:26.800
I'm all about it.

44:26.800 --> 44:29.600
I've just really become quite the plasma fan.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.280
You're biased, we know.

44:31.280 --> 44:32.240
I really am.

44:32.240 --> 44:35.160
It's been working so rock solid for me.

44:35.160 --> 44:36.320
I appreciate your restraint.

44:36.320 --> 44:38.840
You only put in this one story here.

44:38.840 --> 44:40.960
That takes a lot of self-control.

44:40.960 --> 44:43.040
I'm going to get you to switch eventually.

44:43.040 --> 44:44.520
Popi and I, we're still rocking it.

44:44.520 --> 44:45.800
We're still rocking it, right?

44:45.800 --> 44:47.360
Yeah, Popi, you're still there, yes?

44:47.360 --> 44:48.040
Yeah, totally.

44:48.040 --> 44:48.520
Totally.

44:48.520 --> 44:49.560
All day, every day.

44:49.560 --> 44:50.360
Really?

44:50.360 --> 44:51.560
Really?

44:51.560 --> 44:53.600
Yeah.

44:53.600 --> 44:56.440
It's an almost believable yeah.

44:56.440 --> 44:58.320
OK, so I have two computers.

44:58.320 --> 45:01.080
My main computer runs Unity on 1804,

45:01.080 --> 45:04.160
but the laptop that I go walking around with, my T450,

45:04.160 --> 45:05.360
that runs KDE Neon.

45:05.360 --> 45:08.400
I have to point out, still the same install I did just

45:08.400 --> 45:11.040
after I came back from your place, and it's still rocking.

45:11.040 --> 45:11.560
I love it.

45:11.560 --> 45:14.060
I don't want to steal his story because he might share it

45:14.060 --> 45:18.760
on air, but Noah has a hilarious story

45:18.760 --> 45:24.000
that is a true tribute to how stable KDE Neon was for him.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.840
Long story short, he never rebooted

45:26.840 --> 45:28.180
since the initial install.

45:28.180 --> 45:31.000
He'd just been using it and sleeping his laptop, which

45:31.000 --> 45:33.920
bit him in the arse in a major way, but I'll leave it to him.

45:33.920 --> 45:34.520
What?

45:34.520 --> 45:36.420
It's too funny of a story for me to share for him.

45:36.420 --> 45:38.420
I won't take it from him, but it's a good one.

45:38.420 --> 45:40.000
And it's been the same thing for him.

45:40.000 --> 45:40.920
Super rock solid.

45:40.920 --> 45:42.680
We're still running on all of the studio systems here,

45:42.680 --> 45:45.880
so it's great just to see the team getting together in person

45:45.880 --> 45:48.560
to put that final polish on 5.13.

45:48.560 --> 45:50.680
I think that really makes a big difference for some

45:50.680 --> 45:52.440
of these teams, so it's nice to see them have a chance

45:52.440 --> 45:53.680
to be able to do that.

45:53.680 --> 45:56.840
We have much, much, much, much, much more to get into.

45:56.840 --> 45:59.280
Still lots to discuss, so let's take a moment

45:59.280 --> 46:00.580
and thank DigitalOcean.

46:00.580 --> 46:05.280
Go to do.co slash unplugged, where you will get a $100

46:05.280 --> 46:07.920
credit at DigitalOcean when you sign up with a new account.

46:07.920 --> 46:09.840
That lasts for 60 days and gives you a chance

46:09.840 --> 46:11.560
to try out DigitalOcean.

46:11.560 --> 46:14.800
Everything's based on super fast enterprise grade SSDs.

46:14.800 --> 46:17.240
It's designed for developers, but it works for human beings.

46:17.240 --> 46:19.280
They have a dashboard that's so good,

46:19.280 --> 46:21.240
you might call it a dashboard for days.

46:21.240 --> 46:23.100
And now they have new flexible droplets

46:23.100 --> 46:25.120
where you can mix and match resources

46:25.120 --> 46:27.880
that are the most appropriate for your application.

46:27.880 --> 46:30.600
do.co slash unplugged.

46:30.600 --> 46:32.120
They have private networking if you

46:32.120 --> 46:33.720
want to have something in the back end,

46:33.720 --> 46:35.280
like a database or a cache.

46:35.280 --> 46:38.680
They have block storage that you can add to your system

46:38.680 --> 46:39.280
as you need it.

46:39.280 --> 46:40.640
I just put 250 gigs on it.

46:40.640 --> 46:43.160
Oh, big spender, but not really.

46:43.160 --> 46:43.760
Not that bad.

46:43.760 --> 46:45.640
It's pretty reasonably priced for what you get.

46:45.640 --> 46:48.880
Yeah, so for an example, my favorite rig, $0.03 an hour.

46:48.880 --> 46:49.400
What?

46:49.400 --> 46:51.480
Yeah, and that's a significantly fast rig, too.

46:51.480 --> 46:53.140
It's probably more resources than I really

46:53.140 --> 46:54.240
need most of the time.

46:54.240 --> 46:56.340
And you can get a $100 credit when

46:56.340 --> 46:58.920
you go to do.co slash unplugged.

46:58.920 --> 47:01.560
They have a great API that's clearly documented,

47:01.560 --> 47:03.600
easy to follow, and because of that,

47:03.600 --> 47:06.440
there's tons of really good open source code already written.

47:06.440 --> 47:08.280
You can integrate it into your Linux desktop,

47:08.280 --> 47:09.840
like control your droplets.

47:09.840 --> 47:12.000
You can get apps for your phone.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.680
You can get command line scripts.

47:13.680 --> 47:16.280
You can get libraries for your favorite programming language.

47:16.280 --> 47:19.320
I mean, the whole spectrum is covered for DigitalOcean.

47:19.320 --> 47:21.120
Plus, they have a ton of great distributions,

47:21.120 --> 47:22.600
all of the real distributions you'd probably

47:22.600 --> 47:26.240
want to put on a server to begin with, plus that free BSD.

47:26.240 --> 47:27.120
Really?

47:27.120 --> 47:27.680
Yeah.

47:27.680 --> 47:28.180
Wow.

47:28.180 --> 47:30.440
So go check it out, do.co slash unplugged.

47:30.440 --> 47:32.080
Get the $100 credit, and a big thank you

47:32.080 --> 47:34.360
to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the unplugged program,

47:34.360 --> 47:38.120
do.co slash unplugged.

47:38.120 --> 47:40.440
So with the release of 18.04, we've

47:40.440 --> 47:44.000
seen a disappointing trend of clickbait

47:44.000 --> 47:47.600
to try to make or manufacture, you might say,

47:47.600 --> 47:51.080
some drama around the, quote, data collection

47:51.080 --> 47:54.080
services in Ubuntu 18.04.

47:54.080 --> 48:01.560
And even the name is sort of overdramatizing what this is.

48:01.560 --> 48:04.360
If you install Ubuntu 18.04, at the end,

48:04.360 --> 48:08.040
there's a screen that comes up that says what's new in Ubuntu.

48:08.040 --> 48:11.280
And at the end of that screen, it talks about data collection.

48:11.280 --> 48:13.720
And it shows you an example of the data collection.

48:13.720 --> 48:16.160
We're going to go over one of those reports in a moment.

48:16.160 --> 48:19.080
But I've noticed a trend, particularly with YouTube.

48:19.080 --> 48:21.240
And I hate to come on here and be like,

48:21.240 --> 48:22.640
Chris yells at YouTube once again.

48:22.640 --> 48:23.880
Oh, then Chris is back.

48:23.880 --> 48:27.560
But it's pretty disappointing, because it

48:27.560 --> 48:33.400
plays to a well-trained sort of knee-jerk response

48:33.400 --> 48:36.820
that's in the audience to respond badly to anything

48:36.820 --> 48:38.080
about data collection.

48:38.080 --> 48:41.080
Because of all of the Facebook stuff, all of the Google stuff

48:41.080 --> 48:43.240
that we all know, NSA collection,

48:43.240 --> 48:47.000
since Edward Snowden, we've had it drilled into us

48:47.000 --> 48:48.320
that everybody's spying on us.

48:48.320 --> 48:51.120
Windows 10 launched with all these metrics.

48:51.120 --> 48:54.240
It's just been drilled into us that spying equals bad,

48:54.240 --> 48:55.800
data equals bad.

48:55.800 --> 48:58.480
But the reality is, if you're deploying a large-scale

48:58.480 --> 49:01.000
operating system, you have to have some insights

49:01.000 --> 49:02.440
into your customer base.

49:02.440 --> 49:02.960
You have to.

49:02.960 --> 49:05.000
You want that feedback cycle, yeah.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.040
And so there's a line to be walked here.

49:07.040 --> 49:10.320
And I think Canonical has walked it really well,

49:10.320 --> 49:12.560
because they could have gone further than they did.

49:12.560 --> 49:16.040
Essentially, what happens when you opt into this data

49:16.040 --> 49:19.720
collection is you generate a report about your system.

49:19.720 --> 49:23.200
And I'll have an example report linked in the show notes.

49:23.200 --> 49:25.160
And what it does is it collects things

49:25.160 --> 49:27.560
like the version of Ubuntu that you just installed,

49:27.560 --> 49:31.280
the type of processor that you have, the type of GPU,

49:31.280 --> 49:32.840
the vendor and model number, just

49:32.840 --> 49:35.320
like they would be in an Xorg report, nothing fancy.

49:35.320 --> 49:37.400
It's not like it's a super in-depth thing here.

49:37.400 --> 49:41.720
Your screen resolution, if you have live patch or auto log

49:41.720 --> 49:44.400
on, turned on, the desktop environment,

49:44.400 --> 49:49.240
and if you're using Wayland or X, then your time zone,

49:49.240 --> 49:52.880
the media that you use to install, like the ISO,

49:52.880 --> 49:55.720
if you use the minimal install.

49:55.720 --> 49:57.560
And that's essentially it.

49:57.560 --> 49:59.240
There's a couple of other basics in here,

49:59.240 --> 50:01.820
like did you download updates during the install?

50:01.820 --> 50:02.960
That's the data that gets sent.

50:02.960 --> 50:04.520
It's really quite harmless.

50:04.520 --> 50:08.360
And also, if you choose not to participate in the data

50:08.360 --> 50:11.360
collection, there is a one-time ping.

50:11.360 --> 50:13.700
All of this is just a JSON file in clear text

50:13.700 --> 50:15.000
that you can read yourself.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.680
You can just open it up and read it, and it's clear.

50:17.680 --> 50:19.280
And there's a one-time ping that's

50:19.280 --> 50:21.360
sent to Canonical that says user did not

50:21.360 --> 50:23.080
opt into data collection.

50:23.080 --> 50:26.420
There's no IP, no identifiable information.

50:26.420 --> 50:29.920
Will Cook stated they don't even store the IP address

50:29.920 --> 50:32.240
of the HTTP connection in the Apache logs.

50:32.240 --> 50:33.240
On the server side, yeah.

50:33.240 --> 50:33.920
Right.

50:33.920 --> 50:35.160
It's just that they opted out.

50:35.160 --> 50:36.760
So that way, they have a metric to know

50:36.760 --> 50:39.120
how many people are choosing not to use this program,

50:39.120 --> 50:40.520
so they can have idea how unpopular.

50:40.520 --> 50:41.120
Yeah, exactly.

50:41.120 --> 50:43.280
So you know how many total installs are happening.

50:43.280 --> 50:46.240
But that doesn't stop people from attempting

50:46.240 --> 50:50.200
to generate controversy, because that generates clicks

50:50.200 --> 50:52.780
and views and ad dollars.

50:52.780 --> 50:54.860
And if you look at the comments on a couple

50:54.860 --> 50:56.640
of these different YouTube videos,

50:56.640 --> 50:58.240
people are all in on this stuff.

50:58.240 --> 51:01.400
They're all in on it, because they are just

51:01.400 --> 51:03.560
looking at that word data collection,

51:03.560 --> 51:05.240
and they're freaking out.

51:05.240 --> 51:07.000
And the problem is that it actually

51:07.000 --> 51:11.120
handicaps Canonical's ability to really figure out

51:11.120 --> 51:11.920
what's popular.

51:11.920 --> 51:14.240
Like for example, 64-bit versus 32-bit.

51:14.240 --> 51:15.760
How many of their users are actually

51:15.760 --> 51:17.800
using 32-bit processors?

51:17.800 --> 51:20.480
Or how many of them are installing a 32-bit version

51:20.480 --> 51:23.760
of the OS on 64-bit capable hardware?

51:23.760 --> 51:28.920
That simple plain text data file tells them that.

51:28.920 --> 51:30.880
That's a pretty valuable piece of information

51:30.880 --> 51:32.960
that could save them tons of engineering time.

51:32.960 --> 51:34.280
Well, and also it can be very difficult

51:34.280 --> 51:35.720
to get that feedback other ways.

51:35.720 --> 51:39.120
You often see that minority communities are

51:39.120 --> 51:40.540
going to communicate a lot more.

51:40.540 --> 51:42.600
And it's hard to get a sense of just what

51:42.600 --> 51:44.360
a lot of bland default users who don't care

51:44.360 --> 51:46.200
to give feedback to Canonical, this

51:46.200 --> 51:48.840
is a way that they can be sampled in that user base.

51:48.840 --> 51:51.060
Producer Michael responded on one of the videos.

51:51.060 --> 51:53.520
He said, I completely disagree with this video being made,

51:53.520 --> 51:56.160
because none of the collection is a negative thing.

51:56.160 --> 51:58.760
The initial data collection of Ubuntu report of,

51:58.760 --> 52:00.520
it's Ubuntu Dash report by the way,

52:00.520 --> 52:02.360
when you choose not to send info only

52:02.360 --> 52:04.560
sends that you chose not to send info.

52:04.560 --> 52:07.840
The removal of the package merely to not tell them actually

52:07.840 --> 52:10.200
skews the data, because it lowers

52:10.200 --> 52:12.680
the amount of people who will be continued and counted

52:12.680 --> 52:14.120
as not participating.

52:14.120 --> 52:16.860
So these videos are advising uninstall this package,

52:16.860 --> 52:19.520
so that way you don't have anything ever sent to them.

52:19.520 --> 52:20.880
Never even a ping.

52:20.880 --> 52:22.160
Wow.

52:22.160 --> 52:24.280
But the problem is, is then Canonical has no metric

52:24.280 --> 52:26.200
to know how unpopular this is.

52:26.200 --> 52:27.560
So producer Michael goes on.

52:27.560 --> 52:29.460
If you wanted them to know you dislike it,

52:29.460 --> 52:33.320
then you have to send them the info that you opted out.

52:33.320 --> 52:35.360
They have to have that information.

52:35.360 --> 52:37.640
The reason it was made automatic and opt out

52:37.640 --> 52:39.640
is because most people dismiss the pop ups

52:39.640 --> 52:41.200
and close it anyways.

52:41.200 --> 52:43.480
The other aspect is there's some bug data collection

52:43.480 --> 52:45.240
that will automatically get sent to the background that

52:45.240 --> 52:46.640
does contain more information.

52:46.640 --> 52:48.520
But again, that's critical information

52:48.520 --> 52:53.280
that every commercial desktop operating system is collecting.

52:53.280 --> 52:54.800
And that's really my piece on this,

52:54.800 --> 52:57.960
is I think this is actually an example of how

52:57.960 --> 53:01.120
open source media can be, or free software coverage,

53:01.120 --> 53:03.160
or whatever label you want to apply to it,

53:03.160 --> 53:07.560
can actually be destructive to the movement.

53:07.560 --> 53:12.160
Because it creates fear and uncertainty and doubt

53:12.160 --> 53:17.040
about something that is very vanilla and very clear.

53:17.040 --> 53:19.560
You actually, when you finish the first time run wizard

53:19.560 --> 53:22.960
of 1804, you can click a button, and it will show you

53:22.960 --> 53:24.160
what it's going to send.

53:24.160 --> 53:26.160
So you can review all of it.

53:26.160 --> 53:28.000
We also kind of waste an opportunity

53:28.000 --> 53:32.240
to interact with the developers, with the organizations

53:32.240 --> 53:33.640
in the community.

53:33.640 --> 53:35.480
I mean, Ubuntu, I think, has been very clear about what

53:35.480 --> 53:36.440
their purposes were.

53:36.440 --> 53:38.000
There was a long period of assessment

53:38.000 --> 53:39.560
before this feature got included.

53:39.560 --> 53:40.860
So you don't have to pretend it's

53:40.860 --> 53:42.160
some monolithic corporation.

53:42.160 --> 53:43.680
It's not Oracle we're talking about,

53:43.680 --> 53:45.440
where you have to assume the worst.

53:45.440 --> 53:47.560
Why can't we have a good faith discussion about this?

53:47.560 --> 53:49.760
Maybe people don't like it for legitimate reasons.

53:49.760 --> 53:52.120
Let's not start it from a bunch of posturing videos

53:52.120 --> 53:54.160
that haven't bothered to have a conversation.

53:54.160 --> 53:56.240
And Gambus, do you think it's also something

53:56.240 --> 53:58.580
that software developers have more appreciation

53:58.580 --> 54:00.400
for than, say, an average user?

54:00.400 --> 54:04.280
Yeah, I mean, I've been developing some applications

54:04.280 --> 54:09.720
for the Linux desktop, and they are quite specific.

54:09.720 --> 54:14.400
And many times it happened that people just reported,

54:14.400 --> 54:18.680
oh, this thing doesn't work, and I don't know what's going on.

54:18.680 --> 54:23.320
And I just tried troubleshooting and spent many hours

54:23.320 --> 54:25.720
trying to get the information about the hardware.

54:25.720 --> 54:30.280
When if I just add in some user profiling,

54:30.280 --> 54:35.360
well, not user profiling, but some information

54:35.360 --> 54:38.000
that's useful for developers, just like an Oracle is doing,

54:38.000 --> 54:40.900
I would have had a much easier life trying

54:40.900 --> 54:42.720
to troubleshoot all these issues.

54:42.720 --> 54:45.240
And I think this is the same thing for Ubuntu.

54:45.240 --> 54:48.000
I mean, they have to make a distribution that

54:48.000 --> 54:51.960
works on such a great variety of hardware.

54:51.960 --> 54:54.120
And I can only imagine how difficult

54:54.120 --> 54:58.040
it can be to fix so many possible and potential bugs

54:58.040 --> 55:00.600
without knowing anything about the systems

55:00.600 --> 55:03.840
that those bugs are on.

55:03.840 --> 55:07.240
I mean, the typical problem that works on my machine

55:07.240 --> 55:09.960
and nobody else's.

55:09.960 --> 55:12.400
Yeah, it's hard to fully appreciate it

55:12.400 --> 55:14.560
from the support standpoint, and how do you make decisions,

55:14.560 --> 55:16.060
and how do you design your software

55:16.060 --> 55:18.520
when you have zero visibility into your user base.

55:18.520 --> 55:22.440
And if you want to see what the information actually is,

55:22.440 --> 55:24.220
if you're on 18.04 right now, you

55:24.220 --> 55:28.640
can run Ubuntu-report show, and it will generate

55:28.640 --> 55:29.840
the report that gets sent.

55:29.840 --> 55:32.080
So you can review it and see how benign this is.

55:32.080 --> 55:34.320
Wimpy, were you going to jump in with something there?

55:34.320 --> 55:35.360
I was.

55:35.360 --> 55:37.920
There's a couple of issues I have with this particular video.

55:37.920 --> 55:42.280
The first is everything about it is technically inaccurate.

55:42.280 --> 55:45.040
So it's got a wonderful click-baity title.

55:45.040 --> 55:47.360
But the first thing it explains to do

55:47.360 --> 55:50.880
is remove the Ubuntu-report package, which is actually

55:50.880 --> 55:52.800
the wrong package to remove, because that

55:52.800 --> 55:55.840
isn't the package that the GNOME first run wizard interacts

55:55.840 --> 55:56.560
with.

55:56.560 --> 56:02.000
And you actually see this in the video that he clicks no,

56:02.000 --> 56:04.080
and it generates the opt-out report,

56:04.080 --> 56:06.720
and he sort of skips over it a little bit.

56:06.720 --> 56:08.800
So it's removing the wrong package.

56:08.800 --> 56:13.120
He also suggests that you remove popularity contest, which

56:13.120 --> 56:14.800
is also known as PopCon.

56:14.800 --> 56:16.920
Now, that's installed by default,

56:16.920 --> 56:21.320
but it's not enabled by default. And sending a telemetry report

56:21.320 --> 56:22.920
doesn't enable PopCon.

56:22.920 --> 56:26.280
PopCon is installed by default, not enabled,

56:26.280 --> 56:28.640
and we have no plans to turn it on.

56:28.640 --> 56:33.600
So in suggesting that you remove Ubuntu-report and popularity

56:33.600 --> 56:38.520
content because these are the things that collect data,

56:38.520 --> 56:43.160
that also removes the Ubuntu standard meta package.

56:43.160 --> 56:47.520
And what that does is breaks your upgrade path from 18.04

56:47.520 --> 56:49.480
to any subsequent version of Ubuntu.

56:49.480 --> 56:52.240
So if you follow the instructions in this video,

56:52.240 --> 56:55.600
one, it doesn't actually change the behavior

56:55.600 --> 56:58.760
of the first run wizard, and two,

56:58.760 --> 57:01.920
it breaks your ability to upgrade in the future.

57:01.920 --> 57:03.040
Wow.

57:03.040 --> 57:07.400
That is really damaging in a way that I hadn't even

57:07.400 --> 57:09.200
touched on before is that a lot of times

57:09.200 --> 57:11.400
these videos are poorly researched and kind of thrown

57:11.400 --> 57:14.280
together because you need to capitalize on something

57:14.280 --> 57:16.760
while it's very popular in order to generate.

57:16.760 --> 57:18.320
There's no time for research, Chris.

57:18.320 --> 57:20.360
YouTube has this term that they tell

57:20.360 --> 57:23.360
you to score for called VPH, which

57:23.360 --> 57:25.320
stands for views per hour.

57:25.320 --> 57:27.920
And you want to optimize your VPH so that way it

57:27.920 --> 57:30.500
juices the algorithm and puts you in front of subscribers.

57:30.500 --> 57:34.280
And the way you do that is by producing a video on something

57:34.280 --> 57:35.920
that's trending at the moment, that's

57:35.920 --> 57:38.120
popular amongst your audience at the moment.

57:38.120 --> 57:41.640
And so that is a long way of saying

57:41.640 --> 57:45.320
you are incentivized to rush content on YouTube.

57:45.320 --> 57:47.080
And that's damaging as well, right?

57:47.080 --> 57:51.400
Because YouTubers are being incentivized

57:51.400 --> 57:53.960
to produce content quickly, which

57:53.960 --> 57:56.280
could be fine in some respects.

57:56.280 --> 58:01.060
But the 17 pence extra a month that this particular video

58:01.060 --> 58:06.760
is going to generate, which is trading off besmirching

58:06.760 --> 58:11.240
Ubuntu's reputation with a technically inaccurate bit

58:11.240 --> 58:15.800
of video tutorial, that is poisoning the world.

58:15.800 --> 58:17.600
It doesn't help anybody.

58:17.600 --> 58:19.440
You see all of these comments.

58:19.440 --> 58:21.880
They see data collection.

58:21.880 --> 58:25.360
They assume this is like the kind of invasive stuff

58:25.360 --> 58:26.640
that's in Windows 10.

58:26.640 --> 58:28.920
Literally, that's in the comments several times, yeah.

58:28.920 --> 58:31.280
And they make all the wrong assumptions.

58:31.280 --> 58:33.400
And there is nothing in the words

58:33.400 --> 58:38.160
that are used in the video or the title to suggest otherwise.

58:38.160 --> 58:40.400
And the source code's available.

58:40.400 --> 58:42.520
I mean, if you want to research this,

58:42.520 --> 58:45.480
you just go and look at the source code and see how it works.

58:45.480 --> 58:49.560
What I find frustrating is that Martin alluded to the fact

58:49.560 --> 58:52.720
that if you do something, there are some things

58:52.720 --> 58:55.280
that it's possible to do to Ubuntu

58:55.280 --> 58:59.520
that many new users follow blindly a tutorial that

58:59.520 --> 59:01.720
breaks their experience six months down the line.

59:01.720 --> 59:04.440
When they come to upgrade to the next point release,

59:04.440 --> 59:06.280
or if they're more conservative, they

59:06.280 --> 59:08.400
upgrade to the next LTS release.

59:08.400 --> 59:11.600
And the problem is people don't remember.

59:11.600 --> 59:13.400
In six months' time, they won't remember

59:13.400 --> 59:16.500
that a thing they did six months ago

59:16.500 --> 59:19.680
is the reason why they can no longer upgrade.

59:19.680 --> 59:21.200
We get it in the neck.

59:21.200 --> 59:23.720
And people say Ubuntu upgrades don't work.

59:23.720 --> 59:27.560
They do if you don't screw your system in the first place.

59:27.560 --> 59:29.880
But the problem is you screwed your system six months ago,

59:29.880 --> 59:32.280
and you've long forgotten any terminal command

59:32.280 --> 59:35.480
that some random dude on YouTube told you to put in.

59:35.480 --> 59:37.280
You thought it was a good idea at the time,

59:37.280 --> 59:39.400
because that's what he told you.

59:39.400 --> 59:42.000
Six months later, you're in our IRC channel

59:42.000 --> 59:46.520
or on our support network asking us, why is my system broken?

59:46.520 --> 59:48.200
I've upgraded and I've got a black screen,

59:48.200 --> 59:51.400
or it won't upgrade, or it crashes, or whatever.

59:51.400 --> 59:54.160
And we're like, well, that thing you did six months ago,

59:54.160 --> 59:55.280
no, no, no, it's you.

59:55.280 --> 59:58.120
You're the reason all this stuff is broken.

59:58.120 --> 59:59.560
It's Ubuntu's fault.

59:59.560 --> 01:00:01.680
And that's really bitter pill to swallow,

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.760
because we try really hard to make these upgrades work.

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.200
But if people actively shoot themselves in the foot,

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.760
it's really hard to undo that.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.360
And that's really painful six months, two years down the line.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:17.000
So behind the scenes, if you do remove

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
the Ubuntu standard package, which people have done

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.640
for different reasons in error, there

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.880
are some heuristics in the upgrade manager

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.680
that try to figure out, what version of Ubuntu

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:31.560
did you have installed before it got

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.560
gutted to try and piece together what it should

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.360
do to repair the situation?

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.600
But it's a best guess, because you

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.240
can do so much to your system to mess with it.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.720
And this kind of thing, removing the base meta package,

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.640
is just a recipe for disaster.

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.520
Yeah, I'm really glad you brought that up,

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.920
because I hadn't watched more than a few minutes

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.760
into the video where I started to read the comments.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.920
And I got really frustrated, because two things.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.320
It plays on the paranoia of a technically savvy audience

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:00.660
about metrics.

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:03.680
And it builds, perhaps, momentum against future projects

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.280
that might want to do something similar.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.600
And I would argue that is a bad thing,

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.920
because I would make an argument that these metrics are benign

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.880
and that they are beneficial.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.720
And then they are much more beneficial

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.040
than they are in any way benign in a sense

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.160
that they could track you or that they

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.760
would be identifiable.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.400
The thing is you really have to appreciate

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.360
how much insight they're able to gain just

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.920
out of knowing the types of processors, the Windows

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:30.160
server, and desktop environments.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.640
That can significantly give a company

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.040
like Canonical important information

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:39.480
so they know where to focus development resources.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:42.480
And they're competing against commercial operating systems

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.760
that are doing 10 times the level of data collection.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.200
Right, and then on the other side,

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.020
you end up with complaints about, why don't we have this?

01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:48.680
Why don't we have that?

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.720
How come we can't compete?

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.960
And it's just a no-win game in that world.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.980
At the beginning of this episode,

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:56.440
we talked about the Gnome project removing the ability

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.600
to run binary files.

01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:59.600
Imagine, and I'm not suggesting that this

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.320
would be a good world, but let's imagine

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.880
that the Gnome project did have telemetry

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.360
on how people used Gnome Shell.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.480
And let's say they had telemetry that showed that 75%

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.720
of their users, at least once a day,

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:14.360
launched a binary file from their file manager.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.120
They may not be considering removing that functionality.

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.320
But they have no data.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.520
They have no insights other than their gut intuition

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:25.280
and what they grok from the drive-by feedback

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:26.160
that they get.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.240
I have no, and I think most people in Ubuntu

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.240
have no problem with the fact that people

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.440
might want to tick the no box and say, no, I

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:34.560
don't want to do this, right?

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:35.320
Yeah, have at it.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:37.960
It's an individual decision that someone might say,

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.960
you know what?

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.240
I don't care.

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.880
And I actually value my own personal privacy

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:46.240
so much that I don't want to even tell you

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.200
what resolution display I had when

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.880
I installed the software product that I got for you

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.280
for free, right?

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.000
I don't want to tell you that.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.360
OK, fine.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:59.200
But that's another step to then make a video

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:03.040
to tell the whole world not to do that as well.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.160
That's what gets me.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:09.760
Because when you socialize that whole don't allow Canonical

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:12.360
to have any kind of data in order

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.720
to plan what they're doing in the future,

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.680
and then we plan things.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.280
And you say, well, what the fuck were Canonical thinking?

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.680
Why were they doing those things?

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:25.880
Why did they focus on laptops with 1366 by 768 displays?

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.320
Well, because that's the only data we have, right?

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:29.480
That's all we know.

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:32.600
And if we don't know what type of displays there are out there,

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:37.000
what types of CPUs out there, we can't make educated decisions.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.680
And if everyone is told to turn this shit off,

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.320
what the fuck are we going to do?

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:42.280
I agree.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.760
And it's going to scare other projects away

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.440
from something similar.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:48.120
And the thing that is unfortunate

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.680
is this was pretty well implemented,

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.000
I really have to say.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.760
The real cherry on the top was at the end

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.600
where you could see the report or the fact

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.720
that you could show yourself the report at any time.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.320
You can see in a plain text file what's being said.

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:04.280
Simple, transparent.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:07.160
And it's all clearly documented about what from the bug reports

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.780
get sent and all of that telemetry.

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:11.240
So even when it was done, I think,

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.440
probably the most open and transparent way possible,

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.760
including the very source code, the powers, all of this

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.840
is open.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:18.840
I just don't know.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.160
It's obvious that the core issue here

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:26.000
is that there is a financial incentive or a even ego

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.600
incentive for different outlets to try to make hay on this.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.880
There's a lot of stories that just get blown out

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:33.640
of proportion.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.880
And this is just another one of them.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.360
So I've made this point before.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.440
I won't make it again.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.680
But thanks, you guys, for your thoughts on that.

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.920
And just be aware of it, even if you don't want

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.240
to opt into data collection.

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.800
Just be aware of the impact this kind of stuff

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.440
has because I think you're completely, like Popi said,

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.160
you're 100% within your right to not send any data.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.440
I do think it's pretty nice, though, to send them

01:04:58.440 --> 01:04:59.200
the I'm opting out.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.640
So that way, they get a signal.

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.480
So you can essentially have a vote still.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.080
I think that's something to consider.

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:08.200
All right, I want to just also talk about really briefly

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.640
a little follow-up on the reverse engineering

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:16.440
at Purism for some of Intel's FSP stuff that disappeared

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:18.040
off the internet all of a sudden.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:18.920
Whoa.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.840
Yeah, there was a blog post that went up

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:23.960
describing the in-depth technical process

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:26.800
that they went through recently to reverse engineer

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.480
some of this Intel crap.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:31.360
And we noticed on LAN that it disappeared.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.760
And so we made a comment on Linux Action News

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:36.920
that perhaps they had been contacted by Intel.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.920
Yeah, it looks like that was the case.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.200
It looks like Intel politely asked Purism

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.200
to remove their document because they thought it might conflict

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.280
with licensing terms, i.e., if you want to buy processors

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:52.600
from us in the future, you'll be taking that down.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.200
That's a pretty big fist to say no to.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.400
Yeah, and so they complied.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:00.240
However, the internet never forgets, as you well know.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.720
And Chris somehow found a copy in archive.org.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.720
You demon, you.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.800
So if you want to read this extremely in-depth technical

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:10.120
document, I'll have a link in the show notes,

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:14.360
linuxunplug.com, slash 249 to archive.org.

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.040
Wes, I almost think we should save this Docker story

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:17.800
for another day.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.000
It deserves probably a better discussion.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:19.480
Yeah.

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.120
I'll just quickly, last week I made a comment

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.120
at the end of the show.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:24.400
I think nobody's going to like this episode

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.280
because we talked about containers too much.

01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.080
Wah, wah, wah.

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.600
And I got a couple of emails that were like,

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.080
I actually really enjoyed that because nobody else is really

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.080
talking about that.

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.280
And it's a huge part of my life these days.

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.280
And it's a huge part of where software is going.

01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:38.560
So I feel like people have their heads in the sand.

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.600
And then other emails were like, it's new to me.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.880
And I'm learning.

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.160
So it was interesting to hear what you could do with it.

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.680
Nobody really emailed and saying they hated it.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.480
But I assume some people do get tired of us

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:50.680
talking about magical ponies and container technologies.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:53.360
So I'm going to save why Docker is dangerous.

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:56.840
And it's a gamble that you will regret for a future episode.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:57.680
But it's out there.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.680
We'll be talking more about it in the future.

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.560
Because there is still that question

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.240
that I want to get to before we wrap up.

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.520
I want to ask the Mumba Room and Wes if it's

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:09.760
time to move on from the all GTK, our all cute mentality.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:12.240
So let's start first by thanking Ting.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:13.920
I'm taking them to Texas with me.

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:16.560
This show is going to be broadcasted over Ting all

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.360
the way down to Tejas.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:19.760
And it's perfect.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.320
It's pay for what you use wireless.

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.680
So I've got a little MiFi for CDMA.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.480
And I've got a little MiFi for GSM.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:27.260
Because Ting has both networks.

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.640
And I let them sit around for a little bit, boss level.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.880
It's $6 for the line.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.680
So you don't care.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.040
That's funny badger.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.400
And you could just deactivate the device

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:37.200
if you weren't going to use it for six months

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:39.800
and then just order up a SIM and pop it in and good to go again.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.080
That's actually what I've done.

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:41.680
And it's great.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:44.360
Because then I've got CDMA and GSM with me as I go.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.700
And I just pay for the usage.

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:48.880
So whenever I'm parked somewhere that has Wi-Fi, which I always shoot for,

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.880
then I'm not paying anything for data.

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:52.840
It's like I'm just getting by for free.

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:55.140
It's nationwide coverage with no contracts.

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:56.560
It's just $6 for the line.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.800
And you pay for what you use, your minutes, your messages,

01:07:58.800 --> 01:07:59.680
and your megabytes.

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.920
There's a control panel you can log into to always check

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:04.760
your minutes and your messages and your data usage.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:07.480
And you can always take total control, turn stuff on and off,

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.240
activate and deactivate devices.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.440
You can set usage alerts.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.480
If I ever get talked into giving my kids a phone,

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.320
I'm going to start using those usage alerts.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.080
Dylan, stop it.

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:17.600
Too much.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.960
Get off them internets.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:23.160
And they've got lots of devices, including the new Moto devices.

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.120
It's got the modules.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:27.520
Have you seen that where you can snap on a new camera or battery and stuff?

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.360
They're selling that now.

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:31.400
Or you can bring your device, and they'll give you a $25 service credit.

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:32.200
Love it.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:34.400
Might just pay for more than your first month.

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.480
So go check it out.

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:37.360
Linux.ting.com.

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:39.800
That's linux.ting.com.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.840
I just noticed there's a TechSnap logo there.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.040
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.600
That threw me off a little bit.

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:46.320
Am I doing the TechSnap show?

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:46.880
But don't worry.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:50.360
You still get to type linux.ting.com.

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:51.960
And maybe go see the old TechSnap logo.

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:52.920
It's kind of retro.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:53.840
Woo.

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:54.960
I made that logo.

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:55.720
Look at you.

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.720
Yeah, you can tell, too.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:57.600
Professional.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.880
You can tell I made that logo.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:08:59.480
And then we have a new one.

01:08:59.480 --> 01:08:59.960
Yeah.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.760
The new logo is done by a pro.

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:06.520
OK, so this was a question that popped up on the dumpster fire known as RLinux.

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:12.640
And it was asking, is this mentality still relevant today, the all GTK or all Qt mentality?

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.360
I ask this because I've seen people arguing about this online.

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.760
He says, nowadays, there's a lot of disk space.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.920
So usually having two GUI frameworks installed really doesn't make a big

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.520
difference on disk usage.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:26.680
And he says, there's also people who use GTK apps when using a GTK desktop and Qt

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:29.840
apps when using a Qt desktop, and they only use those apps.

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:36.560
And I actually will admit to when I switched back to Plasma again, I tried to just try

01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.360
to do Qt everything.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:42.080
And when I couldn't find a good Qt Twitter client, I just didn't even bother getting

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:42.080
it.

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.480
I just use the website now.

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:43.960
Yeah, sure.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.360
Or I was using Corebird on GNOME.

01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.200
Or some Curses UI you found.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.440
It would be great.

01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:51.840
So I admit I actually do kind of try to skew all Qt now.

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:52.280
Wow.

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:54.600
Backing QO notes and stuff like that.

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.560
Yeah, I admit I've done this a little bit.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.200
What do you think you get out of it?

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.000
Do you like it?

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.120
Do you feel clean?

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.680
There's small things that I appreciate.

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:08.960
Small consistency things like in my open and save dialogues, like my favorites and my

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:13.360
bookmarks are different between my GTK and Qt dialogue open and close boxes.

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:16.520
And that's always frustrating because I'll be working in Qt apps all day, and so I'll

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:17.920
have a new bookmark in there.

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:22.560
And then I go into a GTK app, and I've got to browse the file system like an animal.

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.920
It's so slow.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:25.800
And that stuff is kind of frustrating.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.400
So that makes me kind of prefer that.

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:33.480
And then you get other bennies usually, like the plasma notification integration or KIO

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.320
slave stuff.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.280
And there's just things that are with the Qt apps that I just like to have.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:40.640
Better integration, sort of a first class feel.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.120
Yeah.

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:41.600
Yeah.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.880
You're on the gnome side of things.

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:47.360
You don't seem to shy away from a Qt app, though.

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.640
No, that's fine.

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.560
I don't have a ton of Qt apps.

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.760
You kind of have a mixed family desktop, don't you?

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:54.760
A little bit, yeah.

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:58.560
But yeah, I guess I can see why you might want to do it.

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:02.800
I can appreciate a little of the software purism, but I'm not.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.200
The theme looks a little better.

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.600
Oh, that's gotten a lot better these days.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:09.880
I guess it depends on if it's a program that's easily replaced, then sure.

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:11.360
Maybe you'll find a new program that you love.

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.800
That's one of the great things about being a Linux open source enthusiast, right?

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:16.000
Is you have so many choices.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.640
I'll tell you, I've taken this far enough that I've given Kmail several goes.

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:21.480
OK, yeah.

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:26.080
And I like Kmail in its own way.

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:26.680
I like it.

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:30.400
It's in its own esoteric, unique way.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.600
I like it.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:35.240
But Snap installed MailSpring.

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.520
That's just what I ended up going back to MailSpring.

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:38.240
Yeah, I did.

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:39.120
And it's the Snap, too.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.960
I Snap installed MailSpring.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.800
And it's just better.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.800
But it's like this hybrid app.

01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:45.720
It's not a Qt app, either.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:46.840
Clearly, you've been thinking about it, though.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:47.760
And that bugs me.

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.280
Yeah, it is something that crosses my mind.

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:50.880
What about you guys in the Mumble Room?

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.040
Anybody want to admit if they're a Qt or GTK purist?

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.400
I'm not a purist, no.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:00.800
So I use what is the best tool for the job.

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.480
So for example, I use QoNotes as well.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.640
That's a Qt application.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.880
But it's the best that's available.

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:09.920
I use the Shotcut Video Editor and ABS.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.400
And they're both Qt applications.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.240
And I use VLC, video player.

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.480
And that's a Qt application.

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:15.960
Same.

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:19.120
So yeah, I use what's best.

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.800
Yeah, when you install MailSpring, by the way, little pro tip.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:24.600
If you Snap install MailSpring on the Plasma desktop,

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.360
you also have to install Gnome Keyring in the background.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.440
Because it will not run without that.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:30.880
I have two machines.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:37.920
One is mostly with the approach of let's try to use everything Gnome.

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.440
And the other machine, it's the one I develop in.

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:45.800
That one, of course, is full of everything.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.840
Yeah, interesting.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:49.280
So why do you have the one that's all pure?

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:52.160
Is that, in an ideal world, your preferred setup?

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:57.080
Just generally, I would like to see the project.

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.360
I started with Gnome, essentially.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:03.240
And I'd like to see the project to be able to be self-sufficient in all

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:05.160
of its toolings.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:08.120
There's no better way to try the flow.

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:10.400
I also am a very big fan of default.

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.560
So I don't tend to use things that, by default, are not the way

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.800
I tend to like them most.

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.120
I really don't like fiddling around.

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.880
In the beginning, that was exciting.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:21.800
No longer.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:23.440
There's no time for that.

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:24.440
Yeah, I understand.

01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.640
That's how I kind of see it.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:32.480
Let's try to reduce the foreign aspects and have the experience.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:36.560
And if the experience is not it, try find something else.

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:37.720
Generally, that's how I go.

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:40.600
And something else might mean the whole new package.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.680
I don't care what toolkit an application has.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.600
Looking down my launcher, things that I'm running right now,

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:53.640
Firefox, Telegram, Gnome Terminal, Steam, Slack, IRC, Cloud,

01:13:53.640 --> 01:14:00.920
Visual Studio, Zenkit, VirtualBox, Discord, Signal, and Mumble.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.440
Don't care.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:08.680
So if I want to talk to you, I use Mumble on this show right now.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:12.400
I'm not going to go out there and say, I can't use Mumble because it's cute.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.200
And I've got a GTK desktop.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.360
That's just lunacy, right?

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.680
I'm using the application that I need to get the job done.

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:24.040
And so I installed the right application for the job.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.440
But that's not what I'm advocating.

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:30.040
I'm just saying that there's a preferential path that I have.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.800
And then, of course, you do one or other exception.

01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.480
But I think that for having that cohesive experience,

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:41.800
you do in the beginning go through, oh, maybe there's a lack of this.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.880
And again, I have two machines, and I develop stuff.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:49.720
And it's also one way of seeing, oh, there's a potential target here to develop.

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:57.480
And I can see how someone might want to dive fully into the elementary experience

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:02.440
and only use elementary applications designed, written in Valor,

01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:06.800
delivered in the elementary app store, and designed specifically

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:07.840
for that environment.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.480
And I can see why you might do that.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.200
But I'd be pretty sure after a short while,

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.520
you'd feel like you're missing out on something.

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:17.080
And there's a couple of applications you really need,

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:20.760
and there's someone you need to talk to, or there's some application you need

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.880
access to, or some data you need access to,

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:26.160
that you need to install something that breaks outside of that amazing,

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:31.640
though it is, Valor boundary and into Qt or GTK or whatever.

01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.880
It does seem inevitable from that perspective.

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:37.280
I might want a new user to start out in a consistent world,

01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:40.600
and then you sort of eventually learn about the realities of the world

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:41.200
that we live in.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.320
And OK, it's a little more complicated than the real world.

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:43.840
Got to get the work done.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.440
Yeah.

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:47.760
I do admit to one unique constraint I do usually tend to put myself,

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.800
is to not install apps I cannot maintain myself, in case doomsday.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.000
That is actually also part of how I decide.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Some apps I really like, but for example, they're in Go.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.760
So I'm never going to use them, because I really

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.320
hate that language as an example.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:05.560
And so I'm not going to be willing to maintain it in Go.

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.920
I try to find alternatives or just put the effort in,

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.040
so that it happens in another language that I feel it's the best way.

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:15.200
I love your doomsday scenario is not, I need to find food and drink,

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.880
but I need to be able to code applications I'm using on my laptop.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.520
Well, you have to maintain, right?

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:25.480
What's the point of having source code if one day things shut down

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.000
and you can't fix it?

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.480
The bunker is going to have computers, obviously.

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:32.080
They got to keep running.

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:35.200
Yeah, I think I kind of agree with all of that.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:38.360
But mostly, you got to have the best tool for the job.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.760
And that's always the way I'll land.

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:42.840
Even if it's a GDI application running via wine,

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.040
I'll use it if that's what I have to use.

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:49.200
But if there is any kind of thing that sort of tilts the preference dial,

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:51.240
it would be if I could also get it in whatever

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.680
the native toolkit of my desktop is.

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:55.640
Well, I think that's what Architect in the IRC sums it up perfectly.

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:58.880
Use the least offensive tool for the job.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.200
Yeah, that's very well put.

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:00.720
Yeah, OK.

01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:02.180
I'd love to know your thoughts, too.

01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:06.440
Knowlinuxunplugged.com slash contact where you can send in questions

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:09.600
to the show or if you are acute or GTK purist.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.000
There have been times, especially when using Gnome 3 Shell,

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.080
I'm like, yeah, yeah, I am tempted.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.040
Client-side decorations all the places.

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:16.600
Forever.

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:18.120
Yeah.

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:18.880
Let us know.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.280
Let us know how you feel about it.

01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:23.200
If you want to join our Mumble Room, we do have a setup guide

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:24.040
that you can follow.

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:24.520
Yay.

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:27.040
If you just go Google Jupiter Colony Mumble Setup Guide,

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:27.500
guess what?

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:28.400
You'll pretty much find it.

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.260
It's pretty much all it takes right there.

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:32.080
You can follow Wes on the Twitter.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.560
He's at wespain.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:36.040
You can go get more poppy and wimpy

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:37.760
in the Fantastic Ubuntu Podcast.

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.520
New episode just came out.

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:42.320
And you can find out how many laptops each of them have.

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.320
Oh, boy.

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.640
Also, Wes and I just did a breakdown

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:48.960
of eFail on TechSnap, all of the technical details,

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:51.820
all of those goodies in this week's episode of TechSnap.

01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:54.120
If you want to know more about eFail, what's

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.500
going on with GNU PG and OpenPGP, and what the real details are,

01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:00.000
what the real deets are, it's all in that episode.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.080
All them deets.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.320
All right, thanks so much for tuning

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.440
this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:05.600
And guess what?

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.840
We're going to see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:38.560
I've never installed Linux slash Linux.

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:42.800
Roof, roof, roof.

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.200
Guard dogs on the Unplugged job.

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:46.600
They don't want the show to end.

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:47.600
No.

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.600
Keep it going.

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:49.600
They love the Unplugged program.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.840
Mumba Room, thanks, you guys.

01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:53.760
That was a great conversation and a bunch of stories

01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:55.120
that you had some good insights on.

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.240
So I really appreciate you making it today.

01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.320
You're wonderful.

01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.660
You're gosh darn wonderful.

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:01.000
Now we've got to name this thing.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.400
And the J-bot's still down because, long story short, it was-

01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:05.400
J-bot's down again?

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:06.400
Yeah.

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:07.400
Well, you know that arch box is falling apart, right?

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:08.400
Oh, yeah.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:09.400
Yeah.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:10.400
So I got TCP IP up.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:11.400
No way.

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.400
I know.

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:13.400
Well, it didn't get updated for a couple of years.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.880
So I got the TCP stack working again, and I got SSH up

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:16.880
and running again.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:17.880
Well, those are luxuries.

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:20.040
But I still can't get J-bot to properly function.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.040
Oh.

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.840
But the OS is actually standing again.

01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:23.840
I don't know how I did it.

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:24.840
Okay.

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:25.840
Good.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:26.840
Like a miner through the DigitalOcean console chipping

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:27.840
away at all of the cruft.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:28.840
Literally.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:29.840
So what happened was-

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:30.840
Praise be to that console.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:34.120
The system hadn't been updated for a couple of years.

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:37.320
Because it's been a while since DigitalOcean let you deploy arch.

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.480
Yes, it has.

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:39.480
And so-

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:40.480
Years.

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:41.480
Yeah.

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:42.480
And it got locked to an old kernel and all that.

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:45.760
Anyways, long story short, they had to reboot for Meltdown Inspector.

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:50.520
And when it rebooted, it didn't really ever come back up quite right.

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:57.120
And so I went in there and sort of salvaged the system and got it standing again.

01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:00.560
We figured out we had to SU to Rekai's account.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.560
Yeah.

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:05.320
So we got the little esoteric, like what weird user situation we had to be in, where the

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:06.760
scripts were to start everything.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:07.960
Fired all that out.

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:10.300
And it connects up and it just generates errors.

01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:11.680
So we don't have it long.

01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:15.440
That's my long way of saying we don't have JBOT to do title suggestions.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.960
We have to just come up with it on our own.

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.040
So much pressure.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.040
You can throw it in the chat room though.

01:20:20.040 --> 01:20:21.040
I saw Fudbuntu.

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:23.800
I kind of don't like that though.

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:24.800
Because it sounds like a-

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:26.080
Oh, guard dog.

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.640
It sounds like a flavor.

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:30.280
So I kind of don't like that.

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:33.080
So other title suggestions would be appreciated.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:41.080
I also wanted to point out a documentary by DW, which somebody remind me, DW, are they

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:44.200
out of Germany, I believe, but I'm drawing a blank.

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:49.920
They just did a video called the Microsoft Cyber Attack.

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:54.960
And it's, you know, the premise is a little, but they go to Munich.

01:20:54.960 --> 01:21:01.800
And during all the transition stuff and they talk about how Microsoft lobbied to make some

01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:06.660
of this transition from LibreOffice back to Microsoft software.

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:10.280
And they cover also a French government transition to Linux.

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:16.360
There is some rando shots of consultants using Unity, like at the 27 minute mark, there's

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:20.640
a consultant that they're doing an interview with and she's using Unity on a, it looks

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:21.640
like an XPS.

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:25.400
And she's using the touchscreen to scroll a document that she's showing the journalist.

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:27.440
So I'll have a link to that in the show notes if you want to check it out.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:30.820
The Microsoft Cyber Attack though, if you just go Google it on YouTube.

01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:32.600
And it's in English.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.600
They've done translations.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:34.600
Oh, nice.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:35.600
Great.

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:36.600
Yeah.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:37.600
It was a really cool documentary.

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:41.400
I didn't think the premise started a little like too newbie, you know, I was like, ah,

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.400
this is thick.

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:46.640
But then they got into like the Linux and Limux stuff and then I was all in, which happens

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.000
about halfway into it.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
All right.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.040
We got to name this thing, Wes.

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:51.040
We do.

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.040
What did we talk about?

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.040
Oh, all the things.

01:21:53.040 --> 01:22:08.040
Let's make it easy.
