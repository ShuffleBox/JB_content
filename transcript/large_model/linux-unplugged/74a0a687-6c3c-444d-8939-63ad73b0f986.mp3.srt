1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
After a little over three years in development, the Inkscape team has launched the long-awaited

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,080
version 1.0, and I think Cheesy Bacon over there would be the man to talk to about this.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,640
What do you think, Cheeze, of their 1.0?

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,600
Anything really jump out at you as, like, a great new feature, or...?

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,560
Well, I mean, they have done a lot of work in three years, it seems.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,320
Better high DPI support, we all want that on our vector art applications.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,800
Belaying and chamfering corners, so if you, say, converted some text to a shape and you

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,200
wanted to round corners or chamfer corners, you can easily do that now.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:45,920
They've got some new PNG export options, they've got this really cool split view of X-ray mode

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,880
and your art mode, so you can basically split the screen to see where all of your lines

11
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,040
intersect in a crazy busy piece of vector art, and then you can reveal your actual piece

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,240
of art kind of at the same time.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,120
Just a bunch of really cool new features.

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,080
Variable fonts have been included, there's some additional extensions that have been

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:12,000
added in, pro-level features that you would expect to see in an Adobe or Affinity application,

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
for sure.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, pro for sure.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,400
It really does seem like it's truly a pro-level app, it's completely cross-platform.

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,240
And speaking of extensions, Brent, I know you're excited to see this Python 3 support

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
now.

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
How'd you know that was my favorite?

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,240
Really?

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:36,120
Let's go check it out.

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,560
Hello friends, and welcome into 352 of your local Linux talk show.

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,560
My name is Chris.

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
My name is Wes.

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,600
Oh, fresh from the woods episode, right here for you all.

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,480
It's a big show today.

29
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,800
In-house we have the System76 Lemur Pro.

30
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,800
In my hot little hands, I barely can even feel it, it's so light.

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Let's play toss, Wes, catch!

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:01,360
And I will tell you about the incredible endurance test I put this thing through.

33
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,960
I thought to myself, it seems to me System76 is really signaling that this laptop has an

34
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,360
impressive battery.

35
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,520
So let's see how impressive it is.

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,520
I took the laptop and I took my cell phone and I went into the woods and spent a 12-hour

37
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,520
workday in the woods with this laptop.

38
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,720
I'll tell you how it all went a little bit in the show.

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,200
That's why there's moss on your beard.

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,760
Yeah, I'm going to keep it.

41
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
I'm going to keep it.

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,760
So before we go any further, I got to say a big howdy to Mr. Bacon.

43
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
Hello, Cheesy.

44
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Hey there.

45
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,760
You know, they need to contract you to take their product photos too because you were

46
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,360
taking some awesome photos of that Lemur.

47
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Well, thank you.

48
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,600
I mean, there's a lot coming from you.

49
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,160
Well, I appreciate that.

50
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,360
Yeah, I posted them on the old Instagram.

51
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,400
I got a link in the show notes to the album.

52
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,560
So if you want to see what the sucker looks like out in the woods, it's just a man with

53
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,360
his laptop and his camera phone, Chees.

54
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,840
It was a beautiful thing.

55
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,320
It was beautiful.

56
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,960
And of course, a huge, massive time appropriate greetings to that virtual log.

57
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Hello, Mumble Room.

58
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Hello.

59
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,960
Hello.

60
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
Hello.

61
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
Wow.

62
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Happy Linux Tuesday.

63
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,960
We're hitting 40 people just about in there now when you combine in the quiet listening

64
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
to.

65
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Incredible.

66
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,640
And I'm happy to say that Philip from Mangero is here today to cover some cool Mangero news.

67
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,640
Hello, Philip.

68
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
Hello.

69
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
Hello.

70
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,640
Hello.

71
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,640
Thank you for joining us, sir.

72
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,640
It's great to have you here.

73
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,360
I'm excited to get to your news here in a moment.

74
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,400
But we have a little bit of follow up we need to do on the show right here at the top because

75
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,240
it's something the audience has been asking about.

76
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,040
It's something we committed to.

77
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,800
And there has been some recent developments.

78
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,200
Are you ready, Westpain?

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Standing by.

80
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,980
Westpain, it's time to live update our Arch server right here.

81
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,960
See how it goes live on the show.

82
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,720
Now recently, behind the scenes, we switched this box to the LTS kernel.

83
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,040
It was left on the cutting room floor from a previous version of the show.

84
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,920
But that recent change was made.

85
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,720
Our Arch server is now powered by that LTS kernel.

86
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,120
But it's time for a big upgrade, including system D, a new version of WireGuard, and

87
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
much more.

88
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
So, Westpain?

89
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,120
Logging into the server.

90
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
Good man.

91
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,880
Now, this was our commitment a long time ago, and we decided to, for no good reason, build

92
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,840
an Arch server and then have it run our critical infrastructure.

93
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,200
We thought we'd let you know how it goes.

94
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,580
Now, this is our minimum viable approach to Arch.

95
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,080
Most of the applications are in containers, but one thing we didn't do originally, I think

96
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,880
because of WireGuard potentially, is we didn't go with the LTS kernel.

97
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,320
And you know, why not just try full rolling?

98
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
Yeah.

99
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,120
We decided after not being able to boot one time that it'd probably be better to switch

100
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,120
to LTS.

101
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,120
We made that change.

102
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,680
Yeah, I mean, we're really dependent on ZFS for the system not to boot, but for all those

103
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,160
containerized applications.

104
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,040
And as great as the ZFS on Linux project is doing, the Arch kernel is just moving a little

105
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
too fast sometimes.

106
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
All right.

107
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,040
It's updating.

108
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,440
We've synchronized our package database, pulling down new packages.

109
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,840
Snapper is taking a pre-snapshot.

110
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
Really?

111
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,280
We're that far into it already.

112
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,520
And here's where it gets interesting.

113
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,840
We do have a new point release of the LTS kernel, so DKMS is currently removing our old

114
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,400
ZFS module.

115
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
There's no going back now.

116
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,760
Now, do you know what version of LTS kernel?

117
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,520
Last time I checked, it was 5.4.

118
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,520
Is that what we're sticking with?

119
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,520
Yeah, let's see.

120
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
It was 5.4.33.3.

121
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,520
Yeah.

122
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,520
And what do we got now?

123
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.

124
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
5.4.35.1, maybe?

125
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
5.4.38.

126
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
All right.

127
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,280
And we also, along with this, are going to get a new version of ZFS and WireGuard and

128
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
SystemD.

129
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,320
All right.

130
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,580
You want me to let you proceed with the reboot, and then we'll check back in?

131
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,580
That sounds good.

132
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,580
All right.

133
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,580
Very good.

134
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,580
All right, Wes.

135
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,580
We'll be right back.

136
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,580
Let's see how it goes.

137
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:40,880
In the meantime, on the other end, from server to light and portable, Philip and the team

138
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:48,080
at Manjaro today announced a new partnership with Star Labs for two different super tiny

139
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,860
portable machines, really lightweight laptops.

140
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:56,840
And I also noted, too, that there's a 10% sale going on right now.

141
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,320
The price is unbelievably low for both of them, Philip.

142
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,960
This seems like more, not even more choice, but like a more aggressive style of choice

143
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,320
that the Manjaro project is pursuing in this partnership.

144
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Exactly.

145
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,960
Because we found a new partner, and it's Star Labs, and they produce their own laptops.

146
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,880
So it's no Clevo branding, something like that.

147
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,380
So since 2018, they came around and said, just doing rebrands, this doesn't work out.

148
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,600
So we designed it ourselves and pushed it out there.

149
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,880
And we are happy to be part of that.

150
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,560
Let's start with the details here.

151
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,540
So we have two laptops, an 11-inch and a 13-inch.

152
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:43,040
The 11-inch starts at $424 US greenbacks, and the 13-inch starts at $749 US greenbacks.

153
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,440
It's an aluminum anodized chassis.

154
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,100
The display is LED backlit on both of them using IPS technology.

155
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,400
Both of them are 1080 displays.

156
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:59,560
The 11-inch has a Pentium N4200, I think, which I think works out to be a 1.1 gigahertz

157
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,200
quad core, where the 13-inch has a slightly more powerful, noticeably more powerful i7

158
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,360
unit that works out to be 1.8 gigahertz quad core.

159
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,920
Both of them are coming with a pretty good amount of storage, 240 gigabytes, 8 gigabytes

160
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:19,420
of RAM in these suckers, and Intel graphics 505 and 620, respectively.

161
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:26,440
With USB-C connectivity and charging, with all the typical wireless things you would

162
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:33,520
expect, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, USB-C video out, seven hours of battery life on the 11-inch

163
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,600
and seven hours of battery life on the 13-inch, the weight is super low, too.

164
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,200
These things are 2.54 pounds and 2.65 pounds.

165
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,400
Comes in the box with a USB-C power adapter as well.

166
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,960
You know, I've been thinking about maybe building a new desktop, and having a light little to

167
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,540
go laptop to support that, these seem perfect for this.

168
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,320
So what's the partnership look like here, Philip?

169
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,840
Did you guys work on having to customize the image for these laptops?

170
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,160
Is it running stock manager?

171
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,360
What's that aspect of it like?

172
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:09,120
Well, we partnered up, so we had a meeting with Sean from Starlabs, and they actually

173
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,360
wrote us several times.

174
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:20,240
We had the Station X in 2017, and Starlabs also wrote us, but we thought, hey, a new

175
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,720
startup with no homepage is not a pretty deal.

176
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,920
So we went for Station X back then, and they kept on writing, and now this year we said,

177
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,800
okay, we have time for them, and started the meeting.

178
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,480
And we connected right away, and two days later we had the laptops kind of worked on

179
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,120
and optimized everything from Mancharo.

180
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,760
And yesterday we did this little Star Wars teaser, may the force be with you, and today

181
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,640
we released the news to the world.

182
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,760
Yeah, that was great.

183
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,720
I didn't expect to see it so soon, but it's fantastic to see the news out already.

184
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,240
My question for you is this.

185
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,040
As a project, it seems like you guys are jumping at the opportunity to work with hardware vendors

186
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,320
to offer Mancharo systems preloaded.

187
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,220
Do you have a sense that is a high demand from your community?

188
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,760
And also, like I note, the recent efforts around the Rock Pro 64 chip and how Mancharo

189
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,120
has become just exceptionally easy to deploy on the Pine 64 Rock Pro 64, and that again

190
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,920
is kind of partnering in a sense with a hardware vendor.

191
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,080
Do you think an area of importance for the project?

192
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,200
Well, Mancharo is a desktop Linux, and we try to get as much hardware out there.

193
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:35,800
But when we choose a hardware, it has to be a partnership worldwide, which Starlabs does.

194
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,900
And they have also the possibilities to repair this stuff.

195
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,260
So if you had a broken laptop from them, you can buy parts from them.

196
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,320
So repairing is a huge demand from our end.

197
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,840
And yes, they're a cool bunch of guys and happy to work with them.

198
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,840
Well, that's great.

199
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,320
I mean, that's really nice to hear that it's been an easy partnership there.

200
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,400
Do you have one of these guys kicking around yet?

201
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,960
Yes, we got two devices from the 11 inch to 13 inch we might get as well.

202
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:11,240
And there is a new plan for a 15.6 inch laptop, which is not yet finalized.

203
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:18,200
But we will get redesigns of everything and the community and the Starlabs community decided

204
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,040
to have a little bit hardware upgrade and such.

205
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,920
But this will come maybe late summer to winter.

206
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,000
So to the seasons and we might have even more laptops to go with them.

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,600
I'm curious to know what your first impressions are and if you prefer the 11 or 13 inch.

208
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:40,720
I fell in love with the 11 inch because it's a fanless and long lasting and comes in a

209
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
little box.

210
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,360
We have a sleeve, we have our skin protection.

211
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:51,080
So they've designed everything from the chassis to the internals and the power supply is also

212
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:57,360
designed by them and it comes with the small little changers so we can plug it out for

213
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
each system.

214
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,120
If it's UK, if it's European or is it the States, you have the little small adapters

215
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,120
with you.

216
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,640
You simply plug them out and plug them in and go with it independently.

217
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,280
And it's USB charging in both ends.

218
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,060
You can even charge your laptop.

219
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,240
So one connection to rule them all.

220
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,080
I really love that it's fanless.

221
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,080
That's exciting.

222
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,480
And you know like you were saying Wes, you have a desktop system and then you take this

223
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,120
11 inch with you.

224
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,520
It is at this price point cheaper than an iPad with a keyboard.

225
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:36,040
And it runs Linux and it runs Manjaro Linux so you have the entire Pacman software library

226
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
repository.

227
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,800
That'll be really easy to get my WireGuard VPN up back home.

228
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Perfect.

229
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,920
Yeah, I mean seriously, if you know people out there that are looking at like the iPad,

230
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,440
especially if you get the iPad with that new Magic Keyboard, that keyboard alone is $300.

231
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,000
So it's almost the entire price of the 11 inch.

232
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,080
You can get a couple of them.

233
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
Wow, Philipp.

234
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,080
Well, this is awesome.

235
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,120
So are they available now?

236
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,320
Are they shipping soon?

237
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,120
Yeah, you can order them there of course.

238
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:08,440
And if you have to update your firmware, it's done within Manjaro so you don't have to even

239
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,360
reboot to simply get the firmwares automatically with Gnome firmware software.

240
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,040
And if you want, you can deactivate wireless and webcam of course.

241
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
That's great.

242
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,560
This sounds like a great machine and that 13 inch looks pretty nice too, especially

243
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,240
if you need a little bit larger working space and you want that i7 processor.

244
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
Very cool.

245
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,240
I'll be keeping an eye out.

246
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,600
I would like to see if anybody ends up with one of these, please write into the show.

247
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,720
I'd like to hear your thoughts, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

248
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,720
I think it's going to be a pretty good year for Linux users that are looking at hardware

249
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
right now.

250
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,840
I mean, just Manjaro alone, Philipp, has several options now and it sounds like more down the

251
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
road.

252
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,840
Exactly.

253
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,840
I think it might be one of those, you know, it's a slow burn right now, but in a year

254
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,240
or two, we're going to look back and it'll be a wildly different landscape with a ton

255
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,340
of options compared to before where you just had to, you know, buy some off the shelf windows

256
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,000
machine and hope for the best.

257
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's true.

258
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,260
All right, Mr. Payne, well, you're not off the hook.

259
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,120
How are we doing over there?

260
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,920
Did the system come back online?

261
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Not yet.

262
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Really?

263
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
Not yet.

264
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
How long ago did it reboot?

265
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
Well, just a minute or two.

266
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,040
And it does take quite some time to post as we well know, I could make a run to the server

267
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
room.

268
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
Oh, nope.

269
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,040
Here we go.

270
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,040
Here we go.

271
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,040
Akilas is going down.

272
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
I don't have to get up.

273
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
That's always right at the moment.

274
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,240
That's how long that's exactly what happens every time.

275
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,240
Yeah.

276
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,000
It's almost like how you got to get up to go to the bathroom for your food to get delivered

277
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,320
when we used to go to restaurants.

278
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,480
That's how that server is when it comes to boot time.

279
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,720
I was just going to float this out there.

280
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,180
Here's a crazy idea.

281
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,320
You know what another safe way to run Arch as a server would have been?

282
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,200
To put Proxmox or something on that and then run Arch server as a VM.

283
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,400
Where's the fun in that, though?

284
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,440
Then we could have at least gotten the console from here.

285
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,280
All right, so we're back up.

286
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
Looks that way.

287
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
I see ZFS file systems.

288
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
You do, huh?

289
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,840
I think we're still starting up.

290
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,640
Okay, applications seem like they're starting.

291
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,320
Let's see.

292
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,720
Final seconds, Wes.

293
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Can come back online.

294
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
Yeah.

295
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Here we go.

296
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,720
Really?

297
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
You got it?

298
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
Are you declaring victory?

299
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,880
I am declaring victory.

300
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,280
We've got the new system D, new kernel continuing to work with ZFS and WireGuard.

301
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
Congratulations, sir.

302
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:20,760
That is, I think, longer than I expected it to last at this point.

303
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,700
I think we have crossed that threshold.

304
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,960
What I'm really happy about too is that we've got rid of the DKMS for WireGuard, which is

305
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,960
great.

306
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,860
Now we have ZFS and we will for the foreseeable future.

307
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,860
It just keeps working.

308
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,560
We haven't run into a problem where we had to go futz with getting the ZFS systems remounting,

309
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,740
cleaning up all the stuff that gets kind of broken when that happens.

310
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,200
It's just rock solid.

311
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,880
I'm still loving it.

312
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,880
Lean, mean.

313
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,940
And when you do the updates, it's not hundreds of packages.

314
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,340
It's 15 at most, maybe.

315
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,340
It's pretty light.

316
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,980
I will also say we've been, we switched it up, we've been using the yay AUR helper written

317
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,980
in Go.

318
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,980
And that's been really a dream.

319
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,160
It's fast, works well, it's easy to update and hasn't broken yet.

320
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,880
Yeah, I'm using that on my Manjaro workstation too.

321
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,280
And then I get all of the AUR updates done at the same time.

322
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
I like it.

323
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
And it's actually really good too.

324
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,400
The other thing it's really smart about is it realizes that sometimes there's AUR apps

325
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
you want to skip.

326
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,040
And so right before it does all the AUR updates, it asks you, would you like to skip any of

327
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
these?

328
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
And it gives each one a number value.

329
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,880
And you enter that number value, it can be several with commas, and then it will skip

330
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,720
those packages, which is nice because I have a couple of things that do take quite a while

331
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,080
to build that I don't need.

332
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,080
I don't need that right now.

333
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,080
I'll do it later.

334
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
Yep.

335
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
And I saw that.

336
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,080
I like that about it as well.

337
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,040
I'm wondering, Cheese, did you see that the Raspberry Pi Foundation has released a high

338
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,640
quality camera and the kind of special thing about it is it has a standard camera mount

339
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,640
as well.

340
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,640
Did you see this sucker?

341
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
You know, I didn't.

342
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,880
It was kind of like Christmas whenever I opened up the dock and I started looking and I saw

343
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,040
it and I was like, this is really freaking awesome.

344
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:00,340
The fact that, yeah, you can add type C and CS mount lenses on it.

345
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:08,840
It's 12.3 megapixel Sony sensor, which is half that of my mirrorless Sony camera, which

346
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,000
is a 24 megapixel sensor.

347
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,360
So I would imagine, you know, this would make for a great project where you're wanting to

348
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,840
hook the Pi up, you know, to a camera for, I don't know, a security system or something

349
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,840
like that.

350
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
That's what I was thinking.

351
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,400
You can also output raw, which is great, but I think it might be a little bit much for

352
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,660
like the Pi Zero.

353
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:34,240
So you may have to use something like Pi 3, Pi 4 with a little more horsepower to get

354
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,320
full resolution out of the camera.

355
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,320
Yeah, I think so.

356
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,840
But it's such a cool looking little device, man.

357
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,560
Brent, I found out about this because I was scrolling through Twitter and I started seeing

358
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:49,820
these cool pictures of a farm and then I clicked on the thread and realized that they had several

359
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:54,480
tripods set up where they had this with a big lens mounted on a tripod and then a tripod

360
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
next to it.

361
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,960
They had essentially a Raspberry Pi in an enclosure with a screen and a keyboard and

362
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,440
they were taking pictures kind of using like a desktop UI on the computer.

363
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,640
You know, I'm talking about these kinds of setups where it's like the camera is connected

364
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,280
to the computer and the computer is actually managing the photography.

365
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,440
We call that tethering.

366
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,880
They're essentially tethering with this camera and I think the Sony IMX477 sensor is just

367
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,920
a camera phone sensor, but you can put real glass on it.

368
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,240
What I'm really interested in is something I've been dreaming about for like a decade

369
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:31,120
now is could this be the beginning of open source like pro cameras?

370
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,080
Because we haven't seen anything like that ever, but that's a dream of mine.

371
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,080
So I wonder if this is just the very tip of the beginning of that.

372
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,920
That would be very, very exciting.

373
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,120
That's the exact thought I had when I looked at this setup at the farm they had there and

374
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,500
they were basically taking some of the promo pictures for the announcement of this thing

375
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,000
and it was a Linux desktop.

376
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's wild.

377
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It was great.

378
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm like, wow.

379
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,480
And I thought, you know, as crazy and hokey as this looks to have cables running between

380
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,920
these two things and all of that, it's not beyond what a professional would do anyways.

381
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:07,600
No, I know a bunch of people who they're tethering 100% of the time just because of what the

382
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,240
computer can offer above and beyond, you know, a camera device.

383
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,000
So it's not unheard of by any means, it's very exciting.

384
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,320
Especially in a static set up at a studio environment where you're taking portraits

385
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
of people and whatnot.

386
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,200
I could see that'd be really, really useful.

387
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,520
And it's a reasonable price.

388
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
It's 50 bucks.

389
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
Wow.

390
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,520
Oh yeah.

391
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
Yeah.

392
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
The price is pretty good.

393
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,520
It's 50 bucks.

394
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,520
But beyond that, I was thinking too, recently I was looking at a lot to park the RV, didn't

395
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,040
work out, but my thoughts were, wouldn't it be great to have something like this mounted

396
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:43,160
on the shed that had decent optics and a couple spots and it'd be some low cost build it yourself

397
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
security cam.

398
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
Yeah, I was thinking that too.

399
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,200
Or maybe even if you've got like a solar power set up, you ever seen those wildlife cameras

400
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,760
they drop out in the woods, do that with a Pi.

401
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,760
Absolutely.

402
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,160
You could pretty easily get a USB-C battery on a Raspberry Pi 4 that gets charged by a

403
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,460
solar panel and you know, as long as it could keep it running overnight, probably good.

404
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,460
Really neat to see them doing this.

405
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,280
Yeah, and the price is right, 50 bucks.

406
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,920
Can't really go wrong with that.

407
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,600
So I might end up doing this with one of my Pis.

408
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,980
I've been waiting to do the camera thing because the camera was so low quality.

409
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,280
It does appear that it is sold out from the three of the five vendors.

410
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,600
So Micro Center and Canna Kit have it right now, currently.

411
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
I ordered one.

412
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Oh, you got in already?

413
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
I did, yes.

414
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
Sneaky.

415
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,180
I got to do it for the show, right?

416
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:33,880
That's always like one of those, I'm like, am I tricking myself into buying this or am

417
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,880
I actually going to?

418
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
Yes, I'll review it.

419
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,920
Yes, I really will review this on the show.

420
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,380
That really will happen.

421
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,760
Very neat to see that though.

422
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,980
So I will have a link to that.

423
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,880
And so when they do get back in stock, if you want one, maybe we can get like a live

424
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,080
stream shot set up with it.

425
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,640
I don't think it comes with the glass.

426
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,280
So remember, you do need a lens.

427
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,000
But wouldn't that be cool?

428
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,180
Or like if we did like a barbecue cam with a raspberry pie?

429
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,360
Because I have Canon lenses that would work with it, I believe.

430
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,800
So I already got the glass, not a lot, but I got some of it.

431
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
So maybe we'll give it a go.

432
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,820
Hey, Wes, what do you say we do a little housekeeping?

433
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,880
It's about time.

434
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,600
So we have some things to get into.

435
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,520
The platform for training on a Cloud Guru has now support for playgrounds where you

436
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,280
can go run a server and check this out.

437
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,880
Already they've added Ubuntu 2004 support.

438
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,520
When I started Linux Academy, I was like, guys, we got to stick current with Ubuntu.

439
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,000
We got to stick current.

440
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,480
It's important now.

441
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,620
And it's so cool to see that.

442
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,680
So that's out there now if you have an a Cloud Guru or Linux Academy platform account, check

443
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
that out.

444
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,880
If you're going to learn stuff, you might as well learn on the latest and greatest.

445
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,640
Also, I'd love to have you live.

446
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,200
We have a great, great time with our live stream.

447
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
Sometimes we hang out.

448
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,320
We got like sometimes we're waiting for a guest or sometimes we got a technical issue.

449
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,620
We'll hang out for a little bit and do a little millionaire or something like that on the

450
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,620
live stream.

451
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,320
It's really just like getting some extra show.

452
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,320
It's extra show.

453
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Yeah.

454
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,800
Some people will put it behind a paywall, but here we just give it away for free.

455
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:03,200
jblive.tv, noon Pacific, jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your

456
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
local time.

457
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,720
Now, Drew has got a little side project that I think some of you out there are going to

458
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,720
love.

459
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,600
Televised table reads.

460
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,160
The first episode is live on Thursday, 8pm Eastern.

461
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,600
And Brent will be narrating.

462
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,240
How did he talk you into that, Brent?

463
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
It's Drew.

464
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,200
So I'll collaborate with Drew on anything pretty much.

465
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,880
Drew rumor has it that you're in the back office.

466
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,400
Drew, do you have anything to say for yourself back there?

467
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,020
Yeah, this is something that I've been wanting to do for a little while with all the social

468
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,320
distancing.

469
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,140
You can go out and see live theater or anything.

470
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,200
So I thought, well, I'll bring it into your living room.

471
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,240
So we're going to do it on YouTube live.

472
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,500
First episode, Thursday, 8pm.

473
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,680
If you go out into the woods today by Liz Sauer, and it's really great.

474
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm looking forward to it.

475
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Good on.

476
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,040
So that'll be Thursday, 8pm Eastern.

477
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,960
And you can get updates at TV table reads on Twitter.

478
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,760
I know what I'm doing on Thursday.

479
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
Yeah.

480
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,120
I mean, once Brent was in, that was all it.

481
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I'm watching.

482
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,120
I know you guys.

483
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
No pressure, Brent.

484
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
No pressure.

485
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
Yeah.

486
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
Just don't mess it up.

487
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
There's a bunch of other people collaborating.

488
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,320
We did a little bit of a read through a few days ago, and man, did we ever have a lot

489
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,320
of fun.

490
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:18,480
So it's cool to collaborate with some really great voice actors and writers and everything.

491
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
You guys practiced?

492
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,480
We never do that.

493
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
No.

494
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,480
Wow.

495
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,480
Okay.

496
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
All right.

497
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,480
We better up our game, Wes.

498
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,120
Well, this Sunday, like every Sunday, there was a love plug.

499
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,280
You hear us talk about our mumble room in our live stream, but I know it's the weekday,

500
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,800
so it doesn't work for everybody.

501
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,400
We do get together every Sunday, same bat time, just a different bat day at noon Pacific.

502
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,560
Same mumble room set up, so it's a good chance to get mumble rocking, get your audio dialed

503
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
in.

504
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,120
And then if you ever could join us during the week, you already have it set to go.

505
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,000
But if not, we're getting together every single Sunday.

506
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,800
Man did we get into a lot last Sunday.

507
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Yeah.

508
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,560
Just to clarify, we're just hanging out in the lobby too, so no need to get any special

509
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,560
room.

510
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,360
Just connect to the server and you'll hear everyone there.

511
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,360
Yeah.

512
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,840
You can also find details in the dedicated Geek Shed IRC room.

513
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:11,520
So on the irc.geekshed.net server, there is a dedicated channel just called Luplug.

514
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
You go in there and do that.

515
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,600
Also shout out to Colonel during the lug, we were just sitting around yakking and just

516
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,760
Logitech Trackman MarbleFX like controller, like I think it's a trackball mouse thing.

517
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,120
It's just this crazy thing that Drew was just going on about and he's, oh man, I wish I

518
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
had one.

519
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,320
And Colonel says, hey, I got one and he's going to send it to you.

520
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Did you get it yet, Drew?

521
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
I got it.

522
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Yeah.

523
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,320
I got it just the other day.

524
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
What?

525
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,320
Yeah.

526
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,320
I need to get a converter because it's still an old PS2.

527
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,280
They never did release a USB version.

528
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,000
But yeah, it's sitting on my desk waiting for that part to come in and I'll be using

529
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
it.

530
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,520
He also sent a couple N95 masks over for me too, which was just super sweet.

531
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
What a nice guy.

532
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
Yeah.

533
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
I love that Colonel.

534
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,440
Just the incredible community connections when you can, you know, hang out with like-minded

535
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
folks.

536
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,440
It's amazing.

537
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,000
So that'll be going on this Sunday as well.

538
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I experimented too.

539
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,320
I set up my mobile mobile mobile.

540
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Yeah.

541
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,760
So that way I could like be a moving about and joining us, you know, so that way I could,

542
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,320
you know, be washing dishes and chatting.

543
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,400
Who doesn't want that?

544
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Sometimes you got chores on Sunday.

545
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
That's just how it goes.

546
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Sometimes.

547
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Sometimes you got to work.

548
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
All right.

549
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,040
That is the housekeeping.

550
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,800
So this week in studio, we have the LEMUR or LEMUR or perhaps properly pronounced LEMUR.

551
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
I think that's it.

552
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Yep.

553
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Thanks.

554
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Yeah, that's that confirms it.

555
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,520
This is the LEMUR Pro from system 76.

556
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,680
And I think the most striking thing about it is the 14 inch screen and thin lightweight

557
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,680
aspect of it.

558
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,780
But this unit comes in a couple of different configurations.

559
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:48,680
This unit is as sent to me an i7 at 4.9 gigahertz.

560
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,320
That's the 10 510U.

561
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
What a clock speed.

562
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,360
So it's a 10th generation and it can peak up to 4.9 gigahertz.

563
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,360
Insane.

564
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,360
Yeah.

565
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,460
My brain barely comprehends that.

566
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,040
This unit as configured shipped with 40 gigabytes of RAM.

567
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
What?

568
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,040
So it beats the new MacBook Pro 13 inch because that can only go up to 32.

569
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,280
This goes up to 40 gigabytes.

570
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,000
It has eight gigabytes soldered into the motherboard and then it has an additional user serviceable

571
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
slot.

572
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Whoa.

573
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,800
That is wild in a laptop that thin.

574
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Yeah.

575
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Unheard of.

576
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:29,960
Yeah, it also has two M.2 NVMe slots that you can put to storage and those are also

577
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,480
user serviceable.

578
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,840
This one is configured came with 500 gigabytes of M.2 storage and a 1080p matte display,

579
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,980
which is pretty nice.

580
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,480
And I have some pictures that are linked in the show notes if you want to see what it

581
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
looks like.

582
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
It is one of those.

583
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,400
Hey, somebody in the chat room asked earlier, could you mount it to the wall like you can

584
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,120
with a ThinkPad where it opens up completely flat.

585
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,840
In fact, it opens up so far that it kind of even bends backwards if you want to a little

586
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
bit.

587
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
A little over 180 degrees.

588
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,840
Yes.

589
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,900
I did put a picture of that in the picture album if you want to see that.

590
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,960
So it is that style of hinge and the hinge feels pretty sturdy.

591
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,640
It like stays wherever you put it even when you're carrying the laptop around and whatnot.

592
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,720
It's funny right now.

593
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,280
It's complaining because the battery is very, very, very low.

594
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:20,560
Right now with that, there it goes, as you say, with five percent, I think it's not going

595
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
to last much longer.

596
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
But yeah, I think it just died on me.

597
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
But that's fair.

598
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,560
We'll get into why that's fair.

599
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:30,260
It absolutely should be dying on me right now because I have been punishing this battery.

600
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,260
So I'll tell you about that.

601
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,280
But I want to give you a little first impression information.

602
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,560
Oh, you want to give us some juice?

603
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
Yes.

604
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
Yeah, why not?

605
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
You could absolutely USB-C charge that thing.

606
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
Gosh, I love that.

607
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,680
It has both the barrel charger and a USB-C charger.

608
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,680
So there you go.

609
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
Good idea.

610
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,680
We'll give it a little juice.

611
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,680
It deserves it.

612
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,520
So a couple of first impression items.

613
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,080
It's an aluminum style housing.

614
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,640
Is that actually aluminum or is it a really glossy, hard, whatever it is?

615
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,400
It may not be aluminum or not, but it's very lightweight.

616
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,200
And it has a backlit keyboard.

617
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,400
And I would rate the keyboard as better than the butterfly butterfly style MacBook keyboard.

618
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,960
Not quite ThinkPad level.

619
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
That's in between.

620
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,960
Usable.

621
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,960
Yeah, definitely usable.

622
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,520
Actually, on day four, my space bar started to stick a little bit, but I just sort of

623
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,160
rapidly banged that sucker for a little bit and did the right thing and just hit on it

624
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,400
for a bit and it fixed it.

625
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,380
The 720p webcam is mostly fine.

626
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,760
It's all right.

627
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,080
People specifically wrote in a few questions, so I'm addressing those right now.

628
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,940
Like Eddie wrote in, he said, I'm curious to hear your folks' opinion on the speaker

629
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,960
quality of the Lemur Pro.

630
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,080
I had a previous generation and my expectations for built-in laptops, speakers aren't high,

631
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,920
but they were underwhelming at best.

632
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,080
I wonder if any attention was given in the new Lemur Pro.

633
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,080
What's your impression of it?

634
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,380
You and I both listened to it.

635
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,900
What's your take on the speakers?

636
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,400
Not as bad as I expected, honestly.

637
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,000
I mean, I think better than the ThinkPad that I've got right here.

638
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'd say by a titch.

639
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,120
Yeah, not amazing.

640
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,960
It's not a MacBook quality speaker or anything like that, but it was listenable.

641
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,520
It's probably just a titch better than ThinkPad, and the ThinkPads are barely listenable.

642
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,160
You're definitely going to hear the video you're watching.

643
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,340
You'll be able to make out the vocals just fine.

644
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:11,600
It has two down firing speakers on the side, so if you have it on a hard surface, it sounds

645
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,680
a little bit better, versus if you have it in your lap, it's a little bit harder to understand

646
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,840
because the speakers are down firing.

647
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,400
That's one thing to consider if you care a lot about that, but it does have a headphone

648
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,160
jack, so you could go that route.

649
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,720
Like I said, USB-C, it does USB 3.1.

650
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,200
It has power delivery support, display port support, but no Thunderbolt support.

651
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,320
Yeah, not too uncommon, I think, in this form factor.

652
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,120
I would love to see it, though, because then you could eGPU this sucker, and that would

653
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
be really, really nice.

654
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:44,760
A couple other things that you'll notice after more than maybe this is your second or third

655
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,420
impression after you've been using it for a bit, System76 advertises that this thing

656
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:56,040
uses their open firmware in it, and practically speaking, I think the biggest way you notice

657
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,460
that is unbelievable boot time.

658
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,280
It resumes from sleep freaky fast.

659
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,000
It boots at warp speed.

660
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,280
I don't know how to describe it.

661
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,760
You power it on, actually, this is how fast it boots, is I powered it on, Wes, you were

662
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,320
sitting there, and I was like, did I get it?

663
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,640
And we looked at it, and the OS had booted, and we were like, oh, wow, I guess I had gotten

664
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
it.

665
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,280
We were confused about what was going on, yeah.

666
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,720
When you would expect about your screen to be lighting up for your post screen, that's

667
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,680
pretty much when you're at the OS.

668
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,440
And I got to say, folks at System76, Jeremy in particular, they've been really doing a

669
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,440
ton of work.

670
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
I mean, there's core boot on here.

671
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,920
There's their own embedded controller firmware, as well as a whole bunch of other gadgets,

672
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,120
and I think that's partly why it's just such a nice, slick experience.

673
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,000
Right, so that kind of comes into play when you're doing the OS selection screen, and

674
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,240
that is very simple and clean and easy to read.

675
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,680
And then when you're doing the firmware updates, the screen that it goes to is also very easy

676
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,120
to read, well designed, clean, and all of that is nice and smooth.

677
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,240
So no complaints at all in that regard.

678
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,240
And then the embedded controller firmware itself is GPL3 licensed, and what's so great

679
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,440
about this is you combine that with the fact that this thing is 2.2 pounds, so it's the

680
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,160
lightest weight in its class, so walking long distance carrying this thing is just no issue

681
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
at all.

682
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:21,200
You barely feel it in your bag, and you combine that with the super fast on aspect of it,

683
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,680
it pretty much checks all the box that like a tablet would check too, because it's fast

684
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,120
on, it's lightweight, it has a good keyboard, it's really something.

685
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,800
Also nice when all these customizations is the Intel management engine has been disabled,

686
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,600
and that's a nice little plus that you don't get from most laptop manufacturers.

687
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,360
I think too, the other kind of still hard to get these days is the user serviceable

688
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,560
aspect of this thing.

689
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,680
There is 12 screws you remove from the bottom panel of this laptop.

690
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,480
You can service the drives, you can service the CPU fan, you can easily install, in fact

691
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,560
there's even a guide on System76 support website on how to refresh the thermal paste if you

692
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,920
live in an area where maybe that might be necessary.

693
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,520
And then of course the storage and the RAM and all that is very accessible.

694
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,680
So let's talk about heat for a moment.

695
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:15,280
There is the benchmark side to this, and then there is the practical day to day use of it,

696
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,520
which I did a lot extensively.

697
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,080
I did want to throw this sucker at some serious benchmarks, and luckily just a couple of months

698
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,560
ago we had the most recent XPS 13 in-house.

699
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,120
And we benchmarked that, and we had all of that on file still.

700
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:36,000
So I was able to take the Lemur Pro up against the XPS 13 and see how they perform.

701
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,960
Now there was a bit of a lead that the XPS here had because that XPS had six CPU cores,

702
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,740
where this Lemur has four physical cores, eight threads versus 12 threads.

703
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,360
So there's that aspect of it.

704
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,400
Within these benchmarks, which are primarily focused around software compilation, whenever

705
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,360
you're using something multi-core, this thing can really, really, really haul.

706
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,160
However, when you're using something that seems to peg a single core and peg it as hard

707
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:08,640
as possible, it does tend to tap out at around 2.8 gigahertz after about 15 minutes of full

708
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,240
fledged complete hard out running.

709
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,800
You're getting the temperatures up into the 170 degree range.

710
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:19,200
At that point, the Lemur Pro doesn't seem to really bring the clock above 2.8 gigahertz.

711
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,600
You're not reaching that 4.9 under extreme thermal load.

712
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:28,080
However, if your workload is bursty or even like bursty for a couple of minutes and then

713
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,560
drops back down, you will reach that four gigahertz level very frequently and sometimes

714
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
beyond.

715
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,600
But you will touch four gigahertz quite often.

716
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:42,440
If you keep the thermals below like 165 degrees Fahrenheit, I think the highest I saw going

717
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,160
during the benchmarks was 185 degrees Fahrenheit.

718
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,040
At that point, the fans are not actually all that bad.

719
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,600
I do have a take here.

720
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,000
Keep in mind, this is actually on my phone because this is while I was at home.

721
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,840
The phone is sitting on top of the laptop keyboard.

722
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,400
So this is not at full out, but I explained the situation and you get idea of the noise

723
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
level.

724
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,240
Okay, welcome to the punishment zone.

725
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,180
The microphone is right up against the laptop and what you are hearing is the laptop under

726
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,840
fairly significant actual day to day load.

727
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,000
Currently the CPU is clocking in at 166 degrees Fahrenheit.

728
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,720
I did max out at 185 degrees Fahrenheit temporarily.

729
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,880
What I'm doing now is I still have OBS going, but now I'm actually doing the screen cap

730
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,140
for my coworker.

731
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,880
So I also have them on a video call.

732
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,080
I'm capturing my camera and I'm capturing a terminal window with a video loop playing

733
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,360
behind it, a 4K video loop, I might add, and it's a 1080p canvas.

734
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,640
I'm sending that to my coworker and I'm also monitoring that video in my own VLC window.

735
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:55,160
So there's a lot happening while the video conference is going, while OBS is recording

736
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,560
all of this to disk as a x264 file.

737
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:04,820
So what I'm witnessing here, and this bears out in the benchmarks too, is the laptop really

738
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,880
walks the line between fan noise and thermal throttling.

739
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:13,960
So it will gently thermal throttle constantly around this range to keep the CPUs around

740
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,960
this temperature.

741
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,280
I can push it and it will let me go further.

742
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,880
But if possible, the laptop, the firmware and the CPU all working together, try to keep

743
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,860
the thermals and the fan noise around here.

744
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:33,440
So this is about as loud as this thing gets during real life punishing use.

745
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,480
If you don't push your laptop this hard, you won't even hear this, it stays completely

746
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
silent.

747
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,800
So that was my using it impressions of it.

748
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,920
And I thought that was extremely reasonable because like I said, it's on the keyboard.

749
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:48,280
So when you remove your head further up, it's even quieter.

750
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,400
And Jeremy, since you've been able to join us now, I'm curious on how that firmware is

751
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,600
walking that line because right as I received the unit, there was a firmware update that

752
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,560
seemed to kind of adjust that curve a little bit.

753
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,280
We wanted to maximize the wattage that we could get out of the CPU.

754
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,200
What we're looking at is not frequency, but wattage.

755
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:10,300
And the reason for that is when you're doing multi-core labor, the frequency is much lower,

756
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,440
but the wattage is much higher.

757
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:20,680
So if you have something that only uses one core, you can get up to that 4.9 gigahertz

758
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,820
and you can stay there for a very long time and never hit thermal throttling.

759
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:31,920
But of course, if you're at a multi-core workload, you can't get that high in frequency before

760
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,000
you start to hit power limitations and thermal limitations.

761
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,800
So we try to keep the CPU indefinitely around 20 watts.

762
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,760
These CPUs are typically supposed to be at 15 watts.

763
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,480
I kind of missed the comparison with the XPS 15, but I believe that they're setting their

764
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:59,000
power limits at 25 watts for short term and 15 watts for long term.

765
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,160
Ours is set at 30 watts or 35 watts and 20 watts.

766
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:12,200
So we have a much higher boost when we're doing a short workload and much higher thermal

767
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,080
output when you're doing a long term workload.

768
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:21,920
And then on the fan side, we want to keep the CPU around 88 degrees.

769
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,680
That makes the skin temperature reasonably comfortable.

770
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,560
We don't want to burn people, but we want to get as high as possible while maintaining

771
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,120
a skin temperature that's tolerable.

772
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:42,080
So what we did is set the thermal throttling at 88 degrees and we were able to run with

773
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:48,360
the fan speed that we use as the maximum fan speed indefinitely at 20 watts thermal output.

774
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:53,240
It can actually go up to around 22 watts indefinitely.

775
00:36:53,240 --> 00:37:00,440
So the first fan curve we released was basically the same fan curve, but boosted a lot higher

776
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:04,520
so it would reach 100% fan speed.

777
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:10,340
And that fan is a very powerful fan, very high RPM fan.

778
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:16,640
We don't need to utilize its entire range to remain performant.

779
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,020
You'd be able to push the thing up to 25 watts, but then the skin temperature gets so high

780
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:26,520
and the noise gets so high that it doesn't really make a lot of sense.

781
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:33,040
So we found a nice balance, having the fan max out around 60% RPM, having the CPU throttle

782
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:39,200
at around 88 degrees and having the power limit set at about 20 watts.

783
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
That ended up being a really good balance.

784
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:47,600
I have to agree because in my benchmark testing, I could really see that balance happening.

785
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:55,280
But in my actual day-to-day, actual fairly aggressive workload where I was really trying

786
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,320
to see what it could do, but I wasn't trying to artificially push it, it really did a good

787
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,000
job of walking that line to the point of where most of the time I could never even hear the

788
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
fans.

789
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,080
And Cheesy, to that point, I think you had a question about sort of how the thermals

790
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,700
were monitored during the design of this thing.

791
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,440
At the Superfan event last year, you guys had just built the isolation booth so you

792
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,800
could measure the Thaleo fan speeds and the new fan curves.

793
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,280
Did you put the new LEMUR in that same isolation booth to measure those fan speeds and noises?

794
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:30,360
We did a few times, but the final fan curve was not developed there because, well, all

795
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:35,360
of us are in our own isolation right now due to coronavirus, so...

796
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,360
Of course.

797
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
Yeah, right.

798
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:43,720
The situation is, yeah, we brought the decibel meter.

799
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:50,640
I have very quiet spaces here in my house, too, and we have hardware spread amongst us,

800
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:57,040
so we were able to achieve the same effect without using the completely sound isolated

801
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,040
booth.

802
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,080
Colonel, you have a bit of a theoretical question regarding the firmware and those fan curve

803
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
thresholds.

804
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,760
Yeah, so if you guys are running a custom firmware, would you be able to expose those

805
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:14,640
thermal thresholds and the fan curve algorithms to the users and make those user configurable

806
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,400
maybe by going into the UEFI somehow?

807
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,540
Absolutely.

808
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:27,380
Right now, the configuration is completely hard-coded, but I would expect to be able

809
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:33,340
to dynamically set those as part of the System76 power daemon, and we already do that on our

810
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,480
Thaleo line for the fan curve.

811
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:42,420
It's set in user space, but the important thing for me with OpenEC was that it would

812
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:49,060
work regardless of the user space or kernel running on the machine, so the Lemur Pro,

813
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:56,160
the firmware design, and the EC firmware, both of those are designed to be as driverless

814
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,220
as possible, so you install...

815
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:05,280
For example, on some of our other laptops, you'd need to have System76 software installed

816
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:13,020
in user space to get 100% hardware support for things like keyboard backlight or the

817
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,900
airplane mode button.

818
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:24,380
In this model, everything defaults to a hardware-managed, embed controller-managed setting before being

819
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:28,460
overridden by the operating system if the operating system supports overriding it.

820
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,460
That makes sense, and that sounds like a pretty safe way to handle it.

821
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,220
Real nice, too, if you're going to do some distro hopping and don't quite know how to

822
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,220
set everything up right.

823
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,340
Yeah, that's true, too.

824
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:41,940
Or if you want to go to Windows, you don't have to get any drivers to install Windows.

825
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:48,700
This is the only Core Boot system that has good Windows support, as far as I can tell.

826
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,180
I hadn't thought about that old Windows OS.

827
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:55,380
Because we're using UEFI as one of the things.

828
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,860
Other Core Boot vendors, they're using something else.

829
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:01,460
Chromebooks use DepthCharge as a payload.

830
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,340
Erasm uses Heads, which uses CBIOS, I believe.

831
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:12,120
So we're the only ones that are offering basically the same level of compatibility across distributions

832
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,740
as proprietary firmware offers with this Lemur Pro.

833
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:21,500
I got the sense, just by some of the positioning, but also, I don't know, maybe by the way it

834
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:26,560
was sent out and whatnot, that battery life was a pretty big focus of this laptop.

835
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,500
It's got a 73 watt-hour battery, but the focus really is on how long that 73 watt-hours last,

836
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,500
it seems.

837
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,620
I would of course want a bigger battery no matter what.

838
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:42,540
I know some 15-inch laptops are able to fit a 99.9 watt-hour battery in there.

839
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:46,920
I would love to do a 15-inch after this as a 99.9 watt-hour battery.

840
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:53,620
But there are some important things, especially with 20.04, that increase the battery life

841
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,420
significantly.

842
00:41:55,420 --> 00:42:01,000
You've got much better CPU frequency management with the 5.4 kernel.

843
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,020
And you may notice that if you move between 1910 and 20.04 or move between any older distribution

844
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:13,280
with an older kernel than 5.4, you'll get much longer battery life on the 5.4 kernel.

845
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,420
Also we've done optimizations on the embedded controller side to improve power usage just

846
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,100
at a platform level.

847
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,580
Well it really all kind of comes together.

848
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,940
How often do you get a machine like this just to try out?

849
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:31,600
I mean I have to send it back, but it's a great opportunity.

850
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,700
So I thought, well let's really see what I can do with this.

851
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,940
Kind of a shaggy dog story here, but I'm a member of this program called Harvest Hosts

852
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:43,740
where you can take your RV and you can stay on land at wineries and breweries and golf

853
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,540
courses and farms.

854
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:49,500
We found this local farm in the foothills of the North Cascades of Washington and it's

855
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,740
got 580 acres of forest.

856
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,880
Oh, beautiful.

857
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,280
So we took the RV out there, but there's no electricity, there's no hookups, it's all

858
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,280
off grid.

859
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,940
There is cellular signal, but it was a no power situation.

860
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,600
Every watt counts.

861
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,420
And I had the Lemur with me as my weapon of choice because I needed to just get as much

862
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,160
battery power as possible.

863
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,540
And they have built like these log seats and workspaces.

864
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:22,000
So I grabbed the Lemur and I headed out into the forest for an entire workday with just

865
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,100
my phone and the laptop.

866
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,740
I'm not kidding you.

867
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,020
And I recorded a couple of thoughts.

868
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:30,140
The audio is not incredible because I just had my phone with me, but I wanted to capture

869
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:36,540
stuff as I was experiencing it on a laptop where every minute of battery life mattered.

870
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,980
And I had some complicated work to do that day.

871
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,500
I have arrived at my working spot for the day.

872
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,260
I think this is probably about as far away as I could get from Lady Jubes and still have

873
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,360
decent Wi-Fi performance.

874
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,740
So I'm 100% battery right now.

875
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:57,020
I kept it charged all night and we'll kick off the electron apps, the infamous electron

876
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,540
apps and see how they do on the old battery life.

877
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,940
I realized I sort of scheduled my day around meals.

878
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,420
You probably knew that about me already.

879
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,420
Yeah.

880
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:09,260
But as I recorded this, I started just after I ate breakfast and then lunchtime it was,

881
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,620
you know, time for a break and time to get down to some more complicated tasks.

882
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,800
Well I have to say I'm impressed.

883
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:21,020
It's midday right now, just after lunch and I left the screen on over lunch at my outdoor

884
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,020
workspace.

885
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:26,280
I'm perched on a log and I thought, you know, I need to do a screen cap.

886
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,100
So I'll set up OBS and then go have a sandwich and come back.

887
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:37,260
And I have the webcam going with screen cap of my terminal and a background video looping.

888
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:42,780
And the CPU right now is at 135 degrees Fahrenheit, which is not bad.

889
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,900
I've seen it get a lot higher than that.

890
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:50,900
And I literally have my recorder right next to the laptop.

891
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,660
It's closer to the laptop than it is my face and it's totally silent.

892
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:57,100
I thought I'd come back and hear this fans just blasting on this thing, but what's also

893
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:01,900
really impressive is the battery life is at 64%.

894
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,100
It's estimating three hours and 59 minutes left.

895
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:10,360
I also figured that OBS now wasn't recording, but it was just sitting there capturing nothing

896
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:15,420
burning CPU and GPU cycles, but no, it seems quite fine.

897
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,660
In fact, OBS is only using 10% of the CPU.

898
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:25,660
So I am very impressed with the battery life.

899
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:30,060
This is what I would expect from, I'm not even joking, maybe an ARM Chromebook, but

900
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,060
this is a full fledged Linux box with OBS.

901
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,140
So I just was sitting out here and like, you know, I need to do something for a coworker.

902
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,140
Let me do a screen cap.

903
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,460
At first, when I started setting up, I thought, well, I'll probably get a few hours, especially

904
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,620
once I start launching OBS because I hadn't even installed it yet, so I had to like download

905
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,620
the packages.

906
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,860
But then once I got the packages installed, I'm like, well, I could tether from my phone.

907
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:52,060
So I moved a little bit further away each time and I kind of felt like towards the end

908
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:58,060
of it, like I was challenging myself to drain it down because the little estimator changes

909
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:01,000
sort of in real time, depending on what your workload is.

910
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,140
So I ran net data in the background to kind of capture the battery life on a longer term

911
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,140
graph.

912
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:11,940
And there, one of the things I noticed is that it has a very predictable discharge rate.

913
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:16,620
It seems very consistent, like you could really kind of rely on it kind of consistency.

914
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,620
And so then I felt safe.

915
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:21,260
I mean, I know that sounds silly, but I felt safe to like, I grabbed the laptop and I just

916
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,260
carried it.

917
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,940
I didn't have a bag with me at the time because it's super light.

918
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,060
And I went on for like a mile hike with the laptop and set up and kept working.

919
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,140
It did it.

920
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,140
It made it three meals.

921
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,620
It's just about dinner time.

922
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:37,980
It's just after six p.m. and I walked down to the river because I thought I'd finish

923
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:41,220
off my day, which is about a 10 minute walk from the campground.

924
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:47,780
And that is that was my moment of confidence when I realized I could walk 10 minutes away

925
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,620
and I'll be fine.

926
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:58,860
And sure enough, 30 percent left now with an average CPU load for the last hour, around

927
00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,860
20 percent.

928
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,420
Thank you, Chrome.

929
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,560
And it says I have two hours and nine minutes left with 30 percent power.

930
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,700
So when I've looked at the different aspects of this laptop, the battery definitely is

931
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,900
one of the standout top performing features.

932
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:19,460
I seem to recall many system 76 reviews where we said it's a great laptop if it could just

933
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,340
have a little more battery life.

934
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:26,900
Well, I think they took all the times we asked for that and they put it all into this one

935
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,020
laptop.

936
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,180
It's truly exceptional here.

937
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,140
I don't need to keep working, but I absolutely could.

938
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:38,980
And what's impressive about this is certainly there were times where it was a light load.

939
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:40,960
It was email and chat.

940
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,060
But there were also times where it was pretty consistent OBS screen capture and recording

941
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,940
and a video chat.

942
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:52,260
And I also recorded an episode of the self-hosted podcast.

943
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:57,240
Which includes not only a VoIP session, but also recording a local FLAC file for over

944
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,360
an hour.

945
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:04,140
And just wrapped up a bit ago and I still have, according to this, over two hours of

946
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:05,140
battery life.

947
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,420
I really couldn't ask for any more.

948
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:11,140
I've had also I should mention I've had the screen cranked to 100 percent because outside

949
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,620
it it's a matte display, so it works, but it needs a little extra support.

950
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:20,660
So I cranked it, I cranked the speakers and I cranked the screen brightness and it's been

951
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,900
like that all day long.

952
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,980
OK, system 76.

953
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,980
All right.

954
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:27,980
You made your point.

955
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,980
We get it.

956
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:34,460
I eventually turned it down to 75 percent and then closed up, brought it back, didn't

957
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:37,780
charge it, brought to the studio this morning, came back out of the woods literally this

958
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:44,140
morning for the show and got here and it still had 14 percent battery life.

959
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,060
And then it just died just a few minutes ago.

960
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:48,740
It was an on and off bursty workload.

961
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,740
I was able to carry that thing all day round.

962
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,140
I was all day.

963
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:53,140
I looked at my watch.

964
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,360
I walked I walked a total of one point eight miles that day around the little trails and

965
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,300
stuff like that, carrying the laptop the entire time.

966
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,420
Very lightweight.

967
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,100
So when you combine that battery life, which is just outrageous, it really is great in

968
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,100
2004.

969
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,940
I didn't really spend a lot of time with Pop OS 1910.

970
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:11,820
I mostly just wanted to hop on the new.

971
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:16,740
I asked them for access to the beta a little early so I could play with it.

972
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:20,380
But it really seems like it's system 76 laptops at their best with this.

973
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:25,860
There's been some genuine engineering to make it a pleasant experience combined with the

974
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:29,700
basic ODM hardware platform getting really, really good.

975
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,980
The all day battery life gives you tablet like confidence.

976
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,420
And the crazy lightweight weight means you could carry it around the forest if you want.

977
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:41,300
I mean, and the USB charging is really nice for flexibility because I do have a DC bank

978
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:45,260
of batteries that I could charge from USB off of.

979
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:48,420
So that's nice for me as somebody who's charging off of a DC source to a DC laptop.

980
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,040
I just keep it all DC.

981
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:54,260
You've still got the powerful CPUs and as much RAM as you could possibly ever need so

982
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:57,100
you could really get some serious work done wherever you might be.

983
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:02,500
If your workload depends on really pushing the CPU as far as it can and you're buying

984
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,300
this because you consistently want 4.9 gigahertz.

985
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,300
That's not going to happen.

986
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,880
But that's also not a it's not a realistic workload.

987
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,320
You can play it out in the benchmarks and I did that I'll link it in the show notes

988
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,820
if you want to see the comparison.

989
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:18,220
But in my in my book, that's sort of a phony test because get a server for that.

990
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,220
What are you doing?

991
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:24,580
Well, I did that test and I did I did three hours of that benchmark test on battery to

992
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:26,140
see what the difference would be.

993
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:28,340
I did one all plugged in one on battery.

994
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:34,940
And after three hours of the laptop going full tilt GPU CPU's core is all going crazy

995
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:39,880
with the screen at 100 percent brightness on it still had 24 percent battery after three

996
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,880
hours of that.

997
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,140
Oh, so when I saw that and I thought to myself, well, if I'm doing like a workload that's

998
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:50,620
mostly web browser, electron apps, a little OBS, maybe compile a kernel here or there.

999
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:53,980
I didn't do any of that on this particular workday in the forest, but I thought I had

1000
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,500
a shot at it.

1001
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,820
But what I learned is when you do more real world stuff and you don't do the synthetic

1002
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:03,740
benchmarking, it actually performs even better than you'd expect.

1003
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,820
And that's so I give you, you know, Jeremy, I give you some credit for that in the team

1004
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:11,320
there because I think you guys really figured out that real world balance in a way that

1005
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:15,660
is not necessarily benchmarkable, but when you use it, you definitely notice it.

1006
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,900
Jeremy, do you have any insights to share on the keyboard?

1007
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,460
I felt like it was a pretty good keyboard.

1008
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:22,760
It wasn't like my favorite keyboard I'd ever used, but I had no issues typing on it all

1009
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,760
day long.

1010
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,820
When we get to doing our own chassis, I think we definitely want to have the replaceable

1011
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:34,500
keyboard there with it being so they the depth is decreased a little bit from the Galago

1012
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,500
keyboard.

1013
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,900
I think my favorite keyboard is the Oryx keyboard.

1014
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:44,580
We're looking into designing desktop keyboards, and that actually part of that goes into designing

1015
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:50,060
laptop keyboards and designing the laptop chassis, looking into some some innovative

1016
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:54,020
ways to do layout and do reprogrammability.

1017
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:58,740
And hopefully, hopefully we come up with something better because I don't think I've ever met

1018
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,220
a laptop keyboard that I've I've really been attracted to.

1019
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:07,400
Anytime I'm at a desk, I want to I want to hook up an external keyboard to it.

1020
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,060
Any laptop I've ever had.

1021
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,900
Doesn't matter if it's a ThinkPad X220.

1022
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:17,580
I just don't believe that there's ever been a laptop keyboard that's really been comfortable

1023
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:21,500
to work on for an entire day if you're doing stuff like I do, programming.

1024
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,900
Well, you know what I think?

1025
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,820
I think that's just the kind of thing I want to hear a guy who's working on replacing a

1026
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:31,660
keyboard say because I agree that none of them are as good as they could be.

1027
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:38,500
I think the my T480 gets there close, but if I'm if I'm being honest with you, I'd still

1028
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,500
take a full size desktop keyboard.

1029
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,620
I mean, once you pop over to the mechanical keyboard, you're just spoiled.

1030
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:46,100
Yeah, I can compare, though, the lemurs.

1031
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,660
The lemurs pretty good.

1032
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,940
Compare it to the XPS 13.

1033
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:55,100
I actually have one of those from before I started working at System 76.

1034
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:59,460
And it's it's way better than the XPS 13.

1035
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:04,140
And of course, it blows the the MacBook 2018 out of the water.

1036
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:08,900
Oh, no, I haven't tried their magic keyboard, but I'm pretty sure magic.

1037
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:14,420
You can't just throw the magic adjective onto something that you were selling in 2010.

1038
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:18,220
Decide not to sell because it was too expensive and too thick.

1039
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,580
Pretty sure that's exactly how it works.

1040
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,300
I think you just nailed it.

1041
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,300
And I agree.

1042
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,300
It was a great experience.

1043
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:29,900
And I think it's easy to say, OK, yeah, that's not so crazy.

1044
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:35,020
You know, the Surface Book could get X, Y, Z or the MacBook Air can get this.

1045
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:42,980
But this is a fully integrated Linux solution from the vendor OS and the firmware that obviously

1046
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:43,980
was relevant.

1047
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:51,300
And I received frequent pretty close after I received the device to the nice firmware

1048
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:55,460
boot experience where you're choosing a boot device to the choices that were made in the

1049
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:00,540
fan curves and the thermal curves to just the selections in the brighter screen.

1050
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:05,820
And some of those aspects, plus the the nice slick System 76 and carved logo, which looks

1051
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,380
extremely nice.

1052
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,140
All of that kind of comes together with the updates in 2004, with the improvements in

1053
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:16,540
Pop OS, which we'll talk about next week, all kind of lands to make something that is

1054
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:19,820
in the past, I think, unachievable for Linux users.

1055
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:23,540
And now I think it's close to almost being what we should expect.

1056
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:27,060
At the same time, it's actually here in a real package that you can buy today.

1057
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,480
And this is one of those things where you can get this thing.

1058
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:31,860
You can charge it with USB-C. That's remarkable.

1059
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,420
You can hook it up to a monitor that does power pass through and essentially have a

1060
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:39,380
complete dock like experience with this laptop.

1061
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:41,900
And it'll stay quiet when you're on your conference calls.

1062
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,780
It's got a micro SD card slot in there.

1063
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,700
So when you want to download your photos, it's not a big, huge hassle.

1064
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:53,520
And I'm really impressed because as someone who's been buying these types of laptops over

1065
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,660
the years, you know, trying to run Linux on them or either because they came loaded that

1066
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:01,580
way or I loaded on there myself, I don't think I've ever had an experience quite this smooth.

1067
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:04,820
I for a bit, you know, jumped around.

1068
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:09,220
I put vanilla Ubuntu 2004 on this, ran perfectly fine.

1069
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:14,420
And then when I got my hands on Pop OS 2004, switched over to that.

1070
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,780
And of course, that was super smooth.

1071
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:16,920
The recovery environment's nice.

1072
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,980
The setup is super slick.

1073
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:21,380
Pop Shop and all of that we'll talk about next week is in there too.

1074
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:25,220
And it all comes together in quite the package, like never before seen.

1075
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,740
And I actually legitimately mean that.

1076
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,860
Really seems like quite a balance, you know, there's been there's been a lot of thought

1077
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,660
on System76 side to where this machine fits and what it's good for.

1078
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:38,580
And it's nice to have something that answers that all day work battery life.

1079
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,580
I mean, like I said, I put it in the bag, showed up here at the studio, still have like

1080
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:42,820
14% battery.

1081
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,700
And I just don't understand how that's practical.

1082
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:49,580
It just seems ridiculous, especially with 40 gigs of RAM in that sucker of DDR4 RAM.

1083
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,580
Also really nice to have.

1084
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:53,620
I don't know about everyone else, but sometimes you leave your house and you realize you didn't

1085
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:54,620
grab your charger.

1086
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:58,140
Oh, that never happens to you, Wes.

1087
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,140
Well, all right.

1088
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:05,420
Do check out the pictures in the show notes because it's also it's a nice looking machine

1089
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,420
as well.

1090
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:10,460
Can be a bit of a fingerprint magnet, but I just wipe it down, took the pictures and

1091
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,460
wipe it down.

1092
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,460
And it's not so bad.

1093
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,700
It could also be that I'm a little messy.

1094
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,620
A tip came in from Mike on audio recorder.

1095
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:22,580
He says regarding the conversation about recording different audio sources on your PC in episode

1096
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:25,580
350, you mentioned there's a GUI tool for the Mac.

1097
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:28,300
He says, are you aware of audio recorder for Linux?

1098
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,300
It's on Launchpad.

1099
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:34,780
It says it offers the capabilities you discussed and it also allows for user defined audio

1100
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:35,780
sources.

1101
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:40,020
For example, you can select both the Spotify app and your mic input if you would like to

1102
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,060
record your own karaoke session.

1103
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,700
I mean, assuming that's your thing.

1104
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:44,900
We did know actually.

1105
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,820
But only just recently we've been talking a little bit behind the scenes.

1106
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:52,800
Obviously the team is, we're all audio geeks over here and always looking for easier ways

1107
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,380
to grab clips and just quickly record audio when you don't want to get a full DAW out

1108
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,300
of the box and set up.

1109
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,700
Audio recorder is super handy.

1110
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:00,700
Yeah.

1111
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:05,060
Well, I think the Choose Linux team picked it like as a pick like forever ago.

1112
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,060
Yeah.

1113
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:10,580
So we kind of known internally, but we didn't really remind ourselves about it.

1114
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:15,220
But what I have been finding that really works well for me is it's a, I can't remember the

1115
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:19,860
command now, but it's an FFmpeg command, I think that takes an input audio device.

1116
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:20,860
Yeah.

1117
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:21,940
You can just choose the Pulse device.

1118
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:25,380
And then you just tell it to encode the FLAC or whatever you want and it just, it's a single

1119
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:26,380
command line.

1120
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,620
And I like that just because it's super fast.

1121
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:31,720
And thankfully on that system, my audio devices don't change numbers.

1122
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,620
So it's always audio device two.

1123
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:37,500
I think audio device one is the HDMI output on my video card.

1124
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,020
Of course it is.

1125
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:41,460
And then audio device two is the actual audio device I want.

1126
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:45,840
So I just put that into FFmpeg and it just right there on the command line.

1127
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,300
We might've put that in episode 350.

1128
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,300
I'll double check.

1129
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,300
Yeah.

1130
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,300
So that could be in there.

1131
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:52,380
That's worth checking out.

1132
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:57,420
And then another email comes in says, I'm not sure if you guys have all covered it yet,

1133
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,940
if y'all have covered it yet, but I saw the tail scale and thought you would be interested

1134
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,700
in hearing that they have hosted WireGuard as a service.

1135
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:11,220
It's written in Go, has an open source backend and it's made by a group of ex-Googlers.

1136
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:14,620
Do let us know how that goes because I would be interested in how these hosted WireGuard

1137
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,980
services go.

1138
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:21,140
I have expected that once it hits mainline kernels, you'd start to see them crop up.

1139
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,140
Thank you, Jason.

1140
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:23,780
Well, we'll have another batch next week.

1141
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:25,060
We're going to try to get to the feedback.

1142
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,580
We've been meaning to do it for a couple of weeks.

1143
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:30,420
So if you've got one, you'd like to sneak in the show and get in front of us so we can

1144
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,420
hook our peepers on it.

1145
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:35,820
Go to linuxunplug.com slash contact and drop it over there.

1146
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:36,820
There's a form there.

1147
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:41,240
You fill it out and then robots package it up and deliver it to Wes Payne, who takes

1148
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:44,060
a very discerning look at our feedback.

1149
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,380
Service you provide, Wes.

1150
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:46,820
Sometimes I'll even email you back.

1151
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:49,980
Yeah, I saw you were sneaking off a few emails before the show started.

1152
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:53,340
I knew that meant you were confident in the Arch upgrade, that you weren't like pre-staging.

1153
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:54,340
Yeah, of course.

1154
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,340
All right.

1155
00:58:55,340 --> 00:59:01,260
Well, if you'd like to get that feedback in, like I said, linuxunplug.com slash contact,

1156
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:03,120
while you're over there, please subscribe.

1157
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:06,140
Just get the show automatically every single week.

1158
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:11,620
You'll also find links to guest information or links to things that we particularly covered

1159
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:14,820
in this particular perfect podcast.

1160
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,820
Got it.

1161
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:20,200
At linuxunplug.com slash 352, I was going for the triple P there.

1162
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,200
Pretty proud of that.

1163
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,500
Pretty proud of that.

1164
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,820
Thanks to Philip for joining us.

1165
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:24,820
Thank you, Wes.

1166
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:26,020
Check out Wes at TechSnap.systems.

1167
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,260
He's always rocking it over there.

1168
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,820
Thanks to Mr. Cheesy Bacon and Drew in the back office.

1169
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,960
And of course, our entire mumble room.

1170
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,860
The show is at Linux Unplugged on the Twitter.

1171
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:34,860
I'm at ChrisLS.

1172
00:59:34,860 --> 01:00:02,140
And we'll see you next Tuesday.

1173
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:14,180
Before the post show proceeds, I believe we have a back office correction, real time back

1174
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:17,260
office correction from Drew in the control booth.

1175
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:21,300
Drew, pipe in from the control booth and could you update us on the mistake made at the end

1176
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:22,300
of the show there?

1177
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,300
Yeah.

1178
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:28,340
So audio recorder appears to be something different than sound recorder.

1179
01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:29,340
Dammit.

1180
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:33,740
We had covered sound recorder in Choose Linux, which is a GNOME project.

1181
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,220
Slipping the table over here.

1182
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,500
Yeah, yeah.

1183
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,020
Audio recorder looks pretty cool, though.

1184
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,020
Okay.

1185
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,020
All right.

1186
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:41,300
So those are two different apps to do a similar job.

1187
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,300
That's amazing.

1188
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:46,460
So sound recorder is the one you guys covered and audio recorder is the one that Mike wrote

1189
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:47,460
in about.

1190
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:48,460
All right.

1191
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,460
So sounds like we have something else to check out.

1192
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,460
Very cool.

1193
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:52,460
All right.

1194
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:53,460
Thank you, sir.

1195
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,180
Did the mumble room have any topics that didn't make it into the main show that we wanted

1196
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:58,740
to cover in the post show before we get out of here?

1197
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:00,220
Can I talk about my GNOME frustrations?

1198
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:02,580
Yeah, I want to hear about a GNOME frustration.

1199
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,580
I got GNOME frustrations.

1200
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:10,380
Got this brand new video card, 5700 XT, should be able to work no problem because it's AMD

1201
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:13,820
until GNOME 3.36 comes out.

1202
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:20,140
What I'm dealing with is that if I'm using GNOME 3.36 on any distribution besides Fedora,

1203
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:24,300
my system has this issue with intermittent freezing.

1204
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:30,380
And I've isolated it to GNOME because I have the problem on Arch, I have the problem on

1205
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:36,100
Ubuntu, and I have the same problem on Debut and Unstable.

1206
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:39,780
So would the Fedora difference then be that Fedora is just using Wayland?

1207
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,420
It happens on Wayland and X.

1208
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,420
Oh.

1209
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:43,740
Yeah, that's the problem.

1210
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:46,740
I don't know what the difference between Fedora and all the other ones are, other than

1211
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:50,220
Fedora works a little bit closer with the GNOME team maybe.

1212
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:54,220
During the freezing, do you have high SSD I.O.?

1213
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,220
No.

1214
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:56,700
Are you sure?

1215
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:57,700
Yeah.

1216
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:00,700
Because it happens mostly when I'm just using the web browser.

1217
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,740
Oh my friend, oh my friend.

1218
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:07,380
So hmm, this is interesting because I have an AMD.

1219
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:09,220
Mine is not nearly as nice as yours.

1220
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:12,060
Mine's only a 580.

1221
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:15,700
But this is a saga I have shared on the show before.

1222
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:18,180
So if you think about it, it kind of makes sense.

1223
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:22,100
But I ended up doing a lot of reading, got some few pointers from the audience who've

1224
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:24,220
also run into the same issue.

1225
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:30,300
And what it kind of came down to is there is a I.O. contention issue when both your

1226
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:35,740
disk is getting some access and your GPU is working at the same time.

1227
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:41,340
There is, for some of us, a lag effect that happens where it's like your entire system

1228
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:42,340
locks.

1229
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,700
Sometimes it just manifests as your mouse getting jumpy.

1230
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,780
Sometimes it's a full system lock.

1231
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:51,420
And if you're using a browser like Firefox or Chrome, they're rendering on the GPU and

1232
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:53,580
then they're writing the cache to your disk.

1233
01:02:53,580 --> 01:03:00,580
And it seems to be as pathetic as the sound because, mind you, I'm doing this on a system

1234
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:05,380
with multiple NVMe drives and SSDs.

1235
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:12,560
Everything is fast as hell, 12 cores, 64 gigs of RAM, AMD 580 graphics, and I'm getting

1236
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:16,100
these freezes, lockups, and stutters.

1237
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,860
And what I did is I got the profile, what's it called, Wes?

1238
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,860
The profile service daemon, I think?

1239
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:21,860
Profile sync daemon.

1240
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:24,060
The profile sync daemon.

1241
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:30,100
And what that does, as ridiculous as this sounds, is it syncs and then tricks your browser

1242
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:35,100
into using your cache out of RAM, which not only makes your browser noticeably faster,

1243
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:42,480
even on a fast system, but it removes that disk I.O. aspect and it solved my lag issue.

1244
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,460
And so now I run my browser cache out of RAM.

1245
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:46,820
So that way I don't have this problem.

1246
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:48,780
It's only on that one system.

1247
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:53,100
I do not have the problem on any of my other Linux boxes, but I absolutely have it on that

1248
01:03:53,100 --> 01:04:00,580
one, to the point where I nearly just went back to 16.04 because it does not happen in

1249
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:01,640
the Ubuntu kernel.

1250
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:07,180
You could test this on your system, but in the kernel in Ubuntu 16.04, it does not happen.

1251
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:09,260
The older kernel, something's different.

1252
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:14,580
It is something that started happening in the 5-series kernel going forward.

1253
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:20,260
MiniMech actually done a challenge of changing over to using the profile sync daemon just

1254
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:22,700
this week, just to see what it would run like.

1255
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:23,700
What do you think?

1256
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:28,300
I was listening to his last week talk about it, and literally during the show, using Manjaro,

1257
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:32,100
I slapped it in in five minutes up and running, haven't done anything.

1258
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,100
It worked beautifully.

1259
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:41,020
Now, I use the overlay FS as well to minimize memory and to give the higher sync rate.

1260
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:43,820
It's worked perfect for me, but I think MiniMech has an issue.

1261
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:50,020
But what I was wondering for that guy who's having this issue is, could you run net data

1262
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:54,660
and then you could see, even a couple of seconds after the phrase, you could look at your net

1263
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:57,620
data and see where your bottlenecks are?

1264
01:04:57,620 --> 01:05:00,740
I tried that, just to mention it, and you may get some insights.

1265
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:04,620
I was actually going to suggest that too, Mollett, so that's a really good idea.

1266
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:09,500
But what I noticed was, I think, just a big gap in the data during that time.

1267
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:11,100
You do experience the same problem.

1268
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:16,820
All of a sudden, I had the feeling that my browser was freezing, and I didn't have that

1269
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:17,820
before.

1270
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:21,820
Normally, I have my browser cache just in TempFS, and that worked pretty good.

1271
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:28,140
So I saw no real speed increase by changing to PSD now.

1272
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:33,220
But what I realized, all of a sudden, I had a web page I was visiting, all of a sudden

1273
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:34,700
I had that page freezing.

1274
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:41,020
I was not able to click the links or anything, and then all of a sudden it came back.

1275
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:43,340
And did Profile Sync Demon solve that or not?

1276
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:47,540
I guess the C-Mollett uses other settings.

1277
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:51,260
The C-Mollett uses it in overlay mode, how we told that.

1278
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:54,980
So I probably have to dig the settings and switch to that too.

1279
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:55,980
I didn't.

1280
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:58,260
See, for me, I did not have to use it with Overlay FS.

1281
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,260
I think it is probably better, longer term.

1282
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:01,980
I probably should look back at doing that.

1283
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,580
Well, I didn't have to use it.

1284
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:08,100
It's just, when reading through it, it said that it speeds up the sync, it makes it slightly

1285
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,500
more reliable faster, and it uses less memory.

1286
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,500
So I mean, it was win-win.

1287
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,500
Why wouldn't I use it?

1288
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:18,140
Yeah, I think I'll probably circle back, as they say in business terms, and double down

1289
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,380
on that initiative going forward.

1290
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:24,620
But right now, my go-to-browser strategy includes just the basic setup.

1291
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:26,620
I'll have to revisit that decision.

1292
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:42,820
Well, Synergy Demon.
