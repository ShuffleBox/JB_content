1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
So Popey you you made a post about 11 gig. Oh

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah, yeah 24 oh

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,760
You left yours running as well

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,000
The recorder you left with the recorder running or something or what? Yeah

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,800
So we all use NTP to make sure we're all in sync

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,240
So we don't have to clap or click or anything. Oh, you're all using your own custom NTP server

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,960
Is that what you're doing? Like yeah, well, no, we just all point at the same one. Oh that works

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,320
Yeah, so we're only ever like no, yeah, not to write

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,120
It's not like that so they all the audio recorders start at the same time very smart

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,680
So they're very easy to line up. But the problem is because we've said it to like start recording at nine o'clock

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,300
And audio recorder by default will auto

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,940
Spawn when you log in so the next day off now

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,080
Yeah, me too. I reboot and audio recorders sat there in the background. I didn't even know

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,680
started recording

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,520
Four days later and I'm shutting down my PC for like a kernel update or something and the very last thing to shut down

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,920
I look and see hang on a minute. That thing's been recording for four days and there's an 11 gig file

17
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,920
No, no, there was there was me babbling away in a conversation with my wife about birthday presents and wish lists

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,880
I was like I need to delete this there is going to be something incriminating. Yeah, I'm gonna get rid of it now

19
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,360
I was

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,740
What drew my attention to it was I suddenly thought why is the system monitor showing? There's always CPU activity

21
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,680
What's going on? And then I ran h-top and I was like, what's all do you record a doing running now?

22
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:38,760
Oh, I've been recording audio for half days. This is a legitimate reason why I have I try to always have an extension that puts my

23
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,560
CPU usage up somewhere on my screen because that's often how I'll catch stuff is I'll just glance up and notice wait a minute

24
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,320
That's CPU usage looks a lot higher for them what I'm doing right now on the computer

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,060
And I don't I normally don't check it and sometimes I wouldn't even notice unless I had a little system monitor applet that told

26
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,060
me so if you've seen

27
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
There's a new Chrome bit

28
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,960
So now we've got Chromebooks Chrome boxes and now the thing that's long as ever Chromecast

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,120
That is effectively Chrome in a in a year in a HDMI stick

30
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,480
And you plug in the power and you plug in a keyboard and there's your computer. I was just looking at this actually

31
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,400
It's funny you say that longer Google are completely eating our lunch with these machines. Are they you think you think they're totally like taking

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,240
away, that's how smart their number

33
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,240
Yeah, totally. There's no number one

34
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,160
Laptops on Amazon if you go to right if you go to Amazon and look at laptops the number one seller has a Chromebook

35
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,760
Yeah, no, not a Windows laptop, right or Mac. We should be there

36
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,880
Well, I agree and we are in a way but the thing is is Google's got brand

37
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,160
They got OEMs working with them and it's a simplified package

38
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,720
It's it's sort of it's capitalizing in a way isn't it almost in a way capitalizing on the failed promise of tablets

39
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,400
You know the tablet didn't do it

40
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,640
You ended up needing a keyboard

41
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,280
But you still need something kind of simple like a tablet and something cheap and I don't know maybe this is maybe this is

42
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,120
Maybe this is the right product for the right time

43
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,040
Doesn't necessarily now I wonder I don't know about these USB sticks, but a Chromebook doesn't necessarily mean it's a loss for a Linux

44
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,800
Installation people might get bored with the very basic nature of Chromebook and one look elsewhere. I

45
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,720
Mean well, maybe it'll eventually make more like switchers

46
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,720
I mean like I look at those those stream PCs those really cheap HP PCs that come with Windows 8 1 pre-installed with Bing

47
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,520
And you know what I just look at those as a future Linux boxes as well, I'm not too worried about it

48
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,480
Yeah, I I wish I wish Google would have just wouldn't have been crazy

49
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,040
You know in a crazy universe if Google just would have done like Ubuntu

50
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
That would have been nice

51
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,360
Considering that they have their own I know exactly exactly would have been so cool if they just would have done that

52
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,980
Originally it was crime crime OS originally was based on Ubuntu then they switched

53
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,360
Building their own packages using Gentoo, right? I mean that would have been a heat. That would have that would have changed everything

54
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,400
And it used to use Firefox. Oh

55
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,680
Right

56
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,000
Right, it did didn't know it did that the very first Chrome OS was before the Chrome browser, right?

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,480
And it was Firefox based, wasn't it? Yep

58
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,760
What yes, this is

59
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:22,760
Yes, the original concept was Firefox and a really really thin Ubuntu ish thing

60
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:28,800
Yeah, and it wasn't like Chrome OS so much as it was a distro really. I'm gonna go look for it

61
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,160
Yeah, I wasn't from Google yeah, and I was using it from like

62
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,760
Well, not when it was a Chrome OS release right right as a product when they were coming up with the concept for it

63
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,440
It was Firefox based. Yeah, and I think did you read this in a book?

64
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,400
Is that where you and I both saw this in in the entering the plex? Is that where you got this? It wasn't a book

65
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,520
I can't remember where I remember this from but just know it's somewhere on the history of Chrome OS. Yeah

66
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,860
When Chrome OS was based on Firefox and rejected by Google

67
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,480
My goodness, you're right. I had no idea. Where did you find it? Where did you find that? Yeah, I'm looking for the verge

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There you go

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,280
Chrome OS was originally based on the different rails of Firefox

70
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,360
Yeah

71
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,440
Could you imagine if they would have gone with Firefox and Ubuntu how different the world would be after at this point?

72
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
I wonder if we'd be as successful

73
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,840
Hmm see people still refer to Google having their own in-house Ubuntu

74
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,920
But I think we're you know looking back quite a long time Popey

75
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,440
I mean, do you know anything about that or is it really an internal thing? They still use it internally

76
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,760
Yeah, and is it Ubuntu or is it their their own, you know, spin of Ubuntu?

77
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:48,800
It's it's Ubuntu. It's called gubuntu and it's it's Ubuntu with some stuff ripped out and some other stuff added

78
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,640
Like any corporate desktop is windows stuff ripped out and stuff added so it's no different than that

79
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,480
and

80
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:03,320
The last time we interviewed, you know, if you listen to the show you would have known we interviewed the guy who's responsible for this

81
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,880
at Google and

82
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,880
it's it was

83
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,960
Um, basically isn't it as a new starter at Google you you would have three choices

84
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:18,680
Sorry two choices. You'd either have a PC or a Mac and if you got a Mac you'd get OS 10 if you chose PC

85
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,480
you'd either get Windows or

86
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,400
Ubuntu you could install something else if you want to but that's what you would get

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,320
And yeah, good one too is basically a bunch

88
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:33,560
I mean we have bugs in our bug tracker from you know, the Google IT people who are you know

89
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
working on problems

90
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,480
Delivering it to their to their users, but I haven't I haven't heard much about it for the last night year or so

91
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
I don't know. Yeah

92
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Whether they all use Chrome OS

93
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,880
You know is Chrome OS their new internal desktop operating system

94
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,160
So and this is what I was told from someone who got hired recently and so puppy

95
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,800
I wonder if this lines up with what you heard is

96
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,660
You get like three choices when you get hired at Google right now

97
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,800
You get a gubuntu which is based on

98
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,120
1404 and and and they they rev in a new one every new LTS and that's what they've been doing for a long time now is

99
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,800
The official gubuntu is based on the latest LTS and then so that's your first option

100
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,360
Your second option is a Chromebook and your third option is a MacBook and I guess like if you want to buy a Windows machine

101
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,040
Like you have to get approval and like I think there's like a whole different like path

102
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,200
You have to go through to even get a Windows box at all

103
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,720
So that I don't know if that lines up with what you've heard at all

104
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,720
Yeah, it may well be their policies changed over time. But as I understand it gubuntu still exists. That's all that's all I know

105
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,920
I heard it was the first choice

106
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,920
I heard gubuntu is the top choice

107
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Chromebook second choice or Mac books are second choice and Chrome and Chromebooks are third choice or something like that on on average

108
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,120
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that is bracing for the fools of April

109
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,120
My name is Chris Ted. My name is Matt. Hey Matt episode 86, buddy. That's not that's not too bad

110
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,120
86 already. No, that means we're getting I mean, I don't know if you're familiar with the way this works

111
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,720
But I think that means we're nearing episode 90. I

112
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,120
Believe so. I'm you know, mathematically challenged, but I do believe we got 87 and then a few others

113
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,120
Hey, so but don't worry. We're not even we're not even looking if we're not looking ahead. We haven't lost track

114
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,120
We're focused. We're hunkered in we're in the trenches of episode 86 this week

115
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,120
We got a lot to cover first up. There is a horrible rumor

116
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,120
Horrible rumor spreading around the internet right now

117
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,120
And that is that the Linux kernel is being forked by a very ambitious team

118
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,120
I will tell you more about that in just a little bit as the show goes on and if it's true or not

119
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
and you

120
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,120
You probably have heard this rumor. It's spreading like crazy right now. Also some new improvements coming to the cinnamon desktop

121
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
We're gonna talk about that

122
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,120
Official Linux fest Northwest planning coverage begins and also

123
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,120
We're gonna hopefully get to it this week. I have we been

124
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,120
Have we been negligent in our coverage Matt?

125
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,120
Have we been negligent in covering some of the other distributions that we all know and love out there?

126
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,120
So Matt today we will so we will find out we'll take audience. We will take a test Matt

127
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,120
I will challenge that assumption of yours

128
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,120
And then last and then last but not least there's a really cool device that runs Linux

129
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,120
That is just one of those things reminds you it's really 2015 and it's pretty exciting

130
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,120
And we'll talk about that coming up a little bit in the show

131
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,120
But Matt before we go too far

132
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,120
We do have a you won't be able to hear it

133
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,120
But they over far in the distance Matt if just over the horizon wolf blitzers over there with a little

134
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,120
little breaking news

135
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
That's right. Yeah, we're going to talk a little bit about that

136
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,120
It's a little breaking news breaking news. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, we have a little breaking news right now

137
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,120
You might have heard it

138
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,120
But apparently the systemd team is planning to fork the Linux kernel everybody get your pitchforks

139
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,120
It's time to fight. We are going all-in

140
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
No, not really

141
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,120
They are not forking the Linux kernel but various places on the internet it even made it to hacker news

142
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,120
the pharaonic forms the reddit

143
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,120
And apparently a github account was even created with the name system Damon and registered and registered to somebody

144
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,120
And the whole rumor was is that the systemd folks were going to fork the Linux kernel in order to

145
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,120
Make things just work a little better streamline areas and have full control over the entire stack

146
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,120
Turns out it was totally an April Fool's joke

147
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:26,120
Totally a mumble room. Did you guys did you guys catch this the systemd is forking kernel the kernel story?

148
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:32,120
I saw something saying that it wasn't true on reddit, but yeah, I saw the chatroom talking about it all morning

149
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:41,120
Weekly and it got linked to an actual github repo and the name of the github repositories name

150
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,120
Or at least the system Damon's name is Ivan got you bitch gotcha Ivan gotcha

151
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Yeah, in other words in other words April Fool's April Fool's, right?

152
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:59,120
This isn't really it makes a nice change from people saying the next thing canonical will fork is the Linux kernel

153
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
So that made me

154
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
Oh

155
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
I gotta pull that post down then hang on

156
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
I gotta pull that post down then hang on

157
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Yeah

158
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
People like are you gonna talk about this Chris are you gonna double think? Yeah

159
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,120
I'm gonna talk about this. It's for somehow somehow it missed the Linux action show this weekend

160
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,120
I don't I don't quite know how that happened

161
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,120
Also, I also wanted to give a shout out to the digi. Oh, hi there

162
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,120
I want to give a shout out to the digicam project there at CBIT 2015 and

163
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,120
Digi digicam got an award. It's really cool

164
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:40,120
They actually got the best open source photo management application and digicam is often compared to Adobe Lightroom

165
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Which the project considers to be pretty much in a compliment

166
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,120
But it's an application Lightroom is an application popular among enthusiasts and professional photo photographers on Windows and Mac OS

167
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:57,120
So they consider that to be an achievement and congrats to digicam. I've been specifically looking at digicam perhaps for a close family members

168
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,120
photo workflow in the near future as

169
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,120
as the fruit company who also makes hardware is

170
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:11,120
Sunlighting their long-term ifoto photo management program now seems like the perfect opportunity for those of us who are open source

171
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Enthusiast to recommend a really solid open source alternative to ifoto. I don't think photos is it?

172
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,120
I don't think Apple's replacements it I'm not a big fan of the nearline system

173
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,120
I don't totally totally trust iCloud for the things that I consider to be the most precious digital asset that I own the photos of my

174
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Children so for me perhaps that's a great opportunity to recommend the transition to an open source photo management program

175
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,120
So I'll be doing that for a few people in my life

176
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,120
And I think digicam is probably the one I'm going to pick because the timing is now

177
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,120
It makes sense. I mean because I'm actually in a similar situation with my wife who is not real pleased with that news either

178
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,120
Yeah, and you know and that might actually be a solution

179
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,120
I could actually she's perfectly comfortable with Linux so it's certainly plausible

180
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,120
And what do we always say if you give people tools that are available on Linux and available that you can first set them up

181
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,120
On their existing platform when they make that transition to Linux. It's even easier because all the applications are the same that they love

182
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
Exactly

183
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,120
Congrats to digicam

184
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,120
We just want to give them a little shout out at the top of the Linux Unplugged show episode 86

185
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,120
See it's good luck. It's good luck and then last but not least

186
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Get ready to run that gnome application everywhere you want anywhere everywhere across any distribution

187
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,120
Could it be true? Can it be real? The gnome project thinks so

188
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,120
We've talked about a little bit before but the official first gnome SDK runtime builds are out

189
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
Yeah, this is a gnome runtime

190
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,120
So you can build your gnome application against this runtime and then this runtime gets distributed to any distribution

191
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,120
And as long as you have that runtime the app runs doesn't matter what distro it is

192
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,120
It's based on gnome 3.16 run libraries

193
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,120
And there's this is definitely just a developer preview. So they're considered to be weekly supported

194
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,120
The developer will try to keep them somewhat updated as major issues and API has come up, but right now it's a work in progress

195
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
And I think it's kind of neat

196
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,120
I don't know if anybody in the mobile room has any thoughts on this, but I thought this was a neat way

197
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,120
This is this is kind of clunky. I'll totally admit that it's a little low tech

198
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,120
You're bundling up a whole bunch of libraries and stuff and sticking them in some directory somewhere and then telling developers to write to that

199
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,120
That's what steam does today, but it works and steam selling $60 games doing this

200
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,120
I don't know. I'd like to pick wimpy's brain. What do you think wimpy?

201
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,120
Well, yeah, it's a departure from the traditional way of doing things on Linux

202
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:38,120
But I think systems like this, a way that you can bundle either a runtime or an overlay to give developers a predictable development target is the way that Linux is going to have to go

203
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:45,120
If we're going to continue to want to drive adoption, particularly for application developers

204
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,120
Could you see a distribution like Ubuntu Mate shipping this runtime out of the box?

205
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,120
And maybe even having a package in the repository that gets updated or Ubuntu might or somebody. Could you see a world like that?

206
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:04,120
Yeah, I can. I can see Ubuntu doing it. I can see OpenSUSE are doing it. I can see Fedora doing it

207
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,120
And as soon as you get the big players doing it, then everyone's got it and then you've you've cracked it, haven't you?

208
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,120
Yeah, because you've essentially you create an API, a stable API that people can write to

209
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:21,120
You've created a certain set of expectations that you can write to and that a certain and gnome 3.16 is no slouch

210
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,120
That's the latest and freshest gnome. So it's not going to be that far behind even after a few releases

211
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,120
Having 3.16 as the base is actually going to be pretty good

212
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,120
I mean, Steam seems to be successfully doing it. So maybe others can successfully do it

213
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,120
And we have the hard drive space to have a few extra libraries

214
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,120
And if as long as they keep updated for security fixes, which is always the trick with this kind of stuff

215
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,120
But that's not a challenge we're incapable of solving. We have package managers everywhere

216
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,120
So, yeah, I think it's kind of interesting. We'll see. This could be a great way to get

217
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:00,120
It would be funny if like Qt has like all the real nice technical advantages and market share advantages

218
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,120
But GTK comes along and says, well, but we've got builder

219
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,120
We've got this runtime and we've got a pretty good looking desktop

220
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:14,120
So here's all the things you just here's your here's your complete solution to delivering it on across all distributions

221
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,120
And you don't even have to have like file system overlays and containers

222
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,120
And I think it's not a bad solution. We'll see if anybody really uses it

223
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,120
We'll see. It's going to take somebody to actually package up their application with it

224
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Someone's bound to do it

225
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,120
Has anybody tried it? I mean, how difficult is it?

226
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,120
Super new. Super, super new. Like yesterday new

227
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Yeah, it was just posted online yesterday

228
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,120
So I don't think there's much of anybody using it

229
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,120
But I've just been following it closely on the show because what I'm really trying to crack

230
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,120
And maybe I should make this more obvious, right, is universal application distributions across all distributions

231
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,120
Because on Coder Radio, the email we get in all the time and when we started Coder Radio

232
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,120
The email we get is, hey, so I'm an iOS developer and I just got myself a little Linux machine for the first time

233
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,120
It's really cute and quaint and I want to write an adorable little app for that Linux desktop

234
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,120
Can you point me in the direction of the SDK?

235
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,120
Can you point me how I'm supposed to get started? What I'm supposed to do?

236
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,120
And every time we just have a different answer depending on the trend, you know, it's

237
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,120
And this is a this is a full fledged answer, which I think is kind of exciting

238
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,120
I think it'll be interesting to see where it all ends up in the long run

239
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,120
I agree Matt, I agree

240
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,120
So you can find out more information in the show notes or check blogs.gnome.org

241
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,120
And maybe it goes nowhere

242
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
This is all part of their work on sandbox applications too

243
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,120
So I imagine if you're going to be sandboxing apps, this will become more important as well

244
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:40,120
So it all fits in with application distribution, sandboxing, the future of different desktops

245
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,120
It's a big picture that we're watching come slowly together in front of our eyes

246
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,120
Speaking of bringing things together in front of your eyes, how about your education?

247
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,120
Over at Linux Academy, I mean it, go over to Linux Academy right now and check them out

248
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
They freaking rock

249
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,120
Linux Academy is our sponsor right here on the Unplugged program

250
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,120
And they I think are I think one of the best sponsors for Linux Unplugged

251
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
Because they're such a great fit for you guys

252
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,120
It really is the matchup of open source enthusiasts, Linux administrators, and educators coming together to build something special

253
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,120
And you can take advantage of it by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

254
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

255
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Head over there right now, check them out and get our special discount

256
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Discount at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

257
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,120
Step-by-step video courses for everything they cover and the content is always expanding

258
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,120
So that's very nice and they have downloadable comprehensive study guides you can bring with you on the go

259
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,120
Ah, maybe you're in the shower

260
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,120
Maybe you're traveling

261
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,120
No judging, I'm not going to judge

262
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,120
And they're always, they're always like the best, the best

263
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,120
Because these people really truly get the content and what your goals are

264
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Because they've been in your shoes, they've been in your position

265
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,120
And so when they see things that come up like Docker

266
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,120
And things like Vagrant and Amazon Web Services

267
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,120
They really can wrap their brains around how to make scenario based labs

268
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,120
So that way you can go in and really get your hands on with that technology

269
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,120
And they have self-paced courses where you can set your own limits

270
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,120
You get your percentages when you log in

271
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,120
See exactly where you're going to have to take off, where you're going to leave off

272
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,120
And exactly how long it's going to take you to get through that course

273
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,120
And I like that, I guess I'm a bit of a data head

274
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,120
I like to be able to break it all down and see how long something's going to take me

275
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,120
The idea that I could see the goal of learning Python will take six hours

276
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,120
Or I think it's like five and a half hours on Linux Academy

277
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,120
That is such a, that is a quantifiable thing that I can put that in my head and go

278
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,120
I can learn the basics of Python in five and a half hours?

279
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,120
That is a huge, huge pivot from like I have to learn this nebulous thing called Python

280
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,120
And it's this programming language that's going to be very complicated

281
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,120
You know, it just cuts through all of that

282
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,120
Plus you've got instructor help, you've got live streaming, a fantastic community

283
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,120
And they're going to do some big content updates

284
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
April 16th, they're going to do a live stream

285
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
New content coming to Linux Academy

286
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,120
I've also gotten notes about folks that pass their certifications after training at Linux Academy

287
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,120
And it happens more and more all the time

288
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
It is a really, really great setup

289
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,120
And I think one of the things that I've found is when we'll follow things in the news

290
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,120
I'll be like, this is obviously going to be a big deal

291
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,120
I end up talking to the folks who run Linux Academy, they're already working on courseware for it

292
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
They have a really cool lab setup

293
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,120
When we first brought them on as a sponsor, I got sort of geeky with the backend technology

294
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,120
And really sort of was like, wow man

295
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,120
I was talking to Anthony who runs Linux Academy

296
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,120
If I was going to do this today, like if I was going to launch Jupyter Broadcasting today

297
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
I might seriously do something like this

298
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Because it's so genius

299
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
They've got everything

300
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:38,120
You've Red Hat training, Python, OpenStack, DevOps, Android, PHP, Ruby

301
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,120
The Amazon Web Services stuff is particularly great

302
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Because I find that to be an expensive thing to learn

303
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,120
And the fact that all of the Amazon Web Services are just included with your Linux Academy subscription

304
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Makes that really stress free

305
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Makes that you don't even have to worry about getting that accidental charge from Amazon

306
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
Which I have done

307
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
And it is not cheap

308
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,120
I accidentally one time got charged $200

309
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,120
Because I left an AWS services server running for 30 days by mistake

310
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
Not doing a single thing

311
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
But it was like $280 just running

312
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Because I was just trying to learn Amazon Web Services

313
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
I don't have to worry about that with Linux Academy

314
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,120
linuxacademy.com slash unplug

315
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
Get our special Linux Unplugged discount

316
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,120
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program

317
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,120
You guys are powerful

318
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,120
Alright, so we got some feedback into the show

319
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Tell me that I'm a dummy

320
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,120
He says, Ubuntu touch apps and other distributions are how Chris is wrong

321
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,120
Right, so this has been stopping me from sleeping for a while

322
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,120
Because, well, it wound me up

323
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,120
On a certain episode of Linux Unplugged

324
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,120
Chris questioned how Ubuntu applications made with the Ubuntu SDK

325
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,120
Would look on non-Ubuntu desktop environments

326
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,120
And quite rightly came to the conclusion

327
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
Well, they would probably look out of place

328
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,120
Fine, let's stop right now and talk about something else

329
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
GNOME apps

330
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,120
GNOME apps are effing s

331
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,120
Under anything that isn't GNOME, however

332
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Nobody is giving GNOME a hard time over this

333
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,120
GNOME is essing all over everyone else in their poorly designed applications

334
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,120
And the Ubuntu desktop and other desktops are suffering because of it

335
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,120
And he includes some examples

336
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,120
Here is a GNOME app

337
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
Under Unity

338
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,120
That looks horrible with the client-side decoration

339
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,120
Here's one that also looks quite horrible

340
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,120
Because it doesn't have the right decorations

341
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,120
He says, this is just totally effed

342
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,120
This is Canonical's responsibility for patching GNOME apps to make them look right under Ubuntu

343
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
You could make that argument

344
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,120
But he disagrees

345
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,120
If that's the case, Canonical should be allowed to do whatever they want

346
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
And everybody else just patch that as well

347
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
It goes both ways

348
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,120
So if Canonical could make their own applications

349
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,120
Look or don't look remotely

350
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,120
Look remotely okay under any other desktop

351
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,120
Then that's just fine

352
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
Because GNOME is getting away with it as well

353
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
Canonical shouldn't have

354
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,120
The TLDR is Canonical shouldn't be given a hard time for making their applications

355
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
And if they don't work on anything else

356
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,120
That's nothing different than GNOME and the GNOME apps right now

357
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,120
Or you could say maybe the elementary apps and things like that

358
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,120
What do you think of this argument, Matt?

359
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,120
That's like, hey, if they want to reinvent the wheel

360
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,120
And make them only work okay on the Ubuntu desktop

361
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,120
And not look okay on, say, Fedora with GNOME

362
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
That's totally fine

363
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,120
And this is just my opinion

364
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,120
The whole thing, in my opinion, is just completely ridiculous

365
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,120
It's like, okay, look

366
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,120
As long as they're willing to make their efforts public

367
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
And the code available and all that sort of stuff

368
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
I don't care what they theme it with

369
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,120
Because that's really where the ethical responsibility ends

370
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
Is that, hey, we did something cool, here's the code for it

371
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
You want to pretty it up, go ahead

372
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,120
But it's not their responsibility

373
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,120
They are, in fact, looking out for their desktop environment

374
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
And what they're doing

375
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,120
And if that doesn't play well with other things

376
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,120
Well, whether it be GNOME, Unity, doesn't matter

377
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,120
Same thing applies

378
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,120
It just feels like a real straw man kind of argument

379
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
I have a hard time getting behind it

380
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
Hmm, okay, alright

381
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,120
I can see, yes, I can see that point

382
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,120
Anybody in the mumble room want to jump in

383
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,120
Before I share my thoughts?

384
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:54,120
If I'm an individual, you know, working on an application

385
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,120
I wrote an application called Journal

386
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,120
For the GNOME desktop

387
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,120
And, you know, that's

388
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,120
It's because that's what I use

389
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,120
If I was going to port that over to Ubuntu Touch

390
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,120
That would be fine

391
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,120
But, you know, I would want some assistance

392
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,120
From some actual Ubuntu Touch developers to do that

393
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
So here's my question

394
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,120
So, I think there's a pretty big difference between

395
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,120
A desktop environment implementing something like a client-side decoration

396
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,120
And the world's most popular Linux distribution

397
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,120
Coming up with a new way for applications to look

398
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,120
Because, and the reason why there's a difference

399
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
Is because one is a desktop environment

400
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,120
And one is the most important Linux distribution in the world

401
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
For desktops

402
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
Okay, you see the difference there?

403
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,120
So if you want to write applications for Ubuntu

404
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,120
They are going to look different

405
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,120
And there's more people that probably want to write applications for Ubuntu

406
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,120
Than they do for the general Linux desktop

407
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
So now do you see the difference there?

408
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,120
More people want to write applications for the Ubuntu desktop

409
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,120
Than they want to write for the Linux desktop

410
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,120
So that means more applications will be looking like they're designed for Ubuntu

411
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
Regardless of the distribution you're using

412
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,120
Do you see a problem with that, anybody?

413
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
It's, no

414
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,120
All the way through this I've just been thinking

415
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,120
It's kind of like Qt and GTK

416
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,120
If you run a GTK application on a Qt desktop

417
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
It looks absolutely horrible

418
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,120
Yeah, and you know, I just

419
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,120
I actually don't know if it's going to be a bad thing or not

420
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
I think maybe I was getting a little more hate for it

421
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,120
I'm pointing out it's going to be a thing

422
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,120
Doesn't mean it's going to be a bad thing

423
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
Maybe it'll be fine

424
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,120
In fact, maybe

425
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,120
Because there's going to be like a standard design language

426
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,120
Maybe there'll be the best looking apps on the Linux desktop

427
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
Maybe

428
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Could be, could be

429
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,120
Maybe it'll just take off because it looks good

430
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,120
We'll wait and see

431
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,120
I doubt it

432
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,120
One more little update before we get into Linux Fast Northwest stuff

433
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,120
I thought we'd talk a little bit about Cinnamon just super quick

434
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,120
Because yesterday Clem did a blog post

435
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,120
An update for Mint

436
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,120
And he said a huge amount of work has gone into making Cinnamon load faster

437
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
And I just got an email into the show the other day

438
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,120
It said, how come you guys never talk about Cinnamon?

439
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
So he says, we're only halfway there

440
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
The results aren't conclusive yet

441
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,120
One of our test machines on there

442
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,120
Cinnamon was able to load in less than a second in normal conditions

443
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,120
But can take up to 12 seconds to load the very first time the computer is turned on

444
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,120
Investigations show that this delay took place in Cinnamon menus and Cinnamon desktop

445
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
During the initial loading of application infos

446
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
From like the menus and the user share applications directories

447
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
And the icon themes of course

448
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Through optimizations the loading times were reduced from 12 seconds to 7 seconds on average

449
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,120
Which is the first step but doesn't yet solve anything

450
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,120
He says, we're still working on this and hoping we'll be able to drastically reduce that initial time

451
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,120
Wouldn't it be cool if Cinnamon becomes one of the fastest, snappiest desktops?

452
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,120
That would be very cool, especially considering all its little bells and whistles

453
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:51,120
Mint has also made a call out for photographers and graphics designers and web people

454
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
They need a lot of work there

455
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:59,120
And they'd eventually like to have somebody that could maybe even take over responsibility of the look of Linux Mint

456
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
Some also some information about upcoming releases

457
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,120
Linux Mint 18 is going to be released sometime in 2016

458
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,120
We don't have a specific date yet

459
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:12,120
However, Linux Mint 17.2 which I believe is based on Ubuntu 14.04 will be coming soon

460
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Probably very soon

461
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
So we'll keep an eye out for that

462
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
Congrats to the Linux Mint people

463
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,120
I wanted to try to give them a little coverage since we've been kind of missing that

464
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,120
Anybody want to chime in on anything before I move on?

465
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,120
Okay, good enough

466
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,120
Sometimes there's nothing to say

467
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,120
I wanted to mention that I started a meetup and a couple of things

468
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Boy, there's a lot to cover today

469
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,120
I'm sorry I'm going kind of fast, but I wanted to get to some of our other topics

470
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,120
So I decided to do something

471
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,120
I decided to create a meetup group for Jupyter Broadcasting

472
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,120
I've been kind of trying to figure out the best way to sort of organize future meetups

473
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,120
And as well as Linux Fest Northwest

474
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,120
So I kind of wanted to get an idea of how many people are coming to Linux Fest Northwest for planning

475
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,120
But I realized long term, as the weather gets nice in the Seattle area

476
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:59,120
I'd like to maybe do semi-frequent meetups with Jupyter Broadcasting audience members

477
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,120
Maybe like once a month

478
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,120
Maybe we could even record them or stream them

479
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
You know, eat chat, talk about show stuff

480
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,120
And then of course if we travel and we have an event

481
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,120
We would use this meetup group that I set up to organize events in your local area

482
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:20,120
So I have linked and I will link it right now in the IRC as I'm talking too

483
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,120
I've created an event for Linux Fest Northwest

484
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,120
And I've created just a general Jupyter Broadcasting group on meetup.com

485
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
I don't know if meetup.com is the best place

486
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
But it seems to be pretty popular in the Seattle area

487
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,120
There's lots of open source meetups already on there

488
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,120
So I was hoping maybe we could capitalize on some of that too

489
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,120
So I created an event for Linux Fest Northwest

490
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,120
If you're going to be going

491
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,120
Please go to meetup.com slash Jupyter Broadcasting

492
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,120
And go to the Linux Fest Northwest event

493
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
I'll have it linked in the show notes

494
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
And RSVP

495
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,120
So we just get an idea of how much food and swag items we need to bring

496
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,120
It would be a rough idea

497
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
I think it's got a lot of potential if you think about it

498
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
Because there's a lot of local folks that would love to do that

499
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
I think maybe then we could get a list of local folks

500
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,120
And in the future we'll have the list

501
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,120
And we can let them know we're going to do other meetups as well

502
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,120
I don't know if meetup lets you

503
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,120
But maybe we could just notify you when you're going to be in your area too

504
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,120
Because I figure when we travel or we go to other fests

505
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,120
We could use this as a way to sort of organize events in that area too

506
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,120
So the site or the page is meetup.com slash Jupyter Broadcasting

507
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
And the event is linked in the show notes

508
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,120
So we start with Linux Fest Northwest

509
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,120
Maybe give us an idea of how many you're going

510
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,120
And then we'll use it for other stuff

511
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,120
That would be neat

512
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,120
Who needs a mumble and bye guys? I'm replacing you with people in real life

513
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,120
Ha!

514
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,120
No kidding right?

515
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,120
I'm just kidding

516
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,120
Actually Wimpy sounds so good this week you'd almost think he's in studio

517
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,120
I know, it's a new mic or something?

518
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,120
What did you do Wimpy? Tell Matt

519
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,120
It's an old mic

520
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
I got some old kit from the loft

521
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,120
And a few USB adapters

522
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,120
And had a bit of an experiment last night

523
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
And you sound good

524
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
Wow

525
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
Doesn't he sound good?

526
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
He sounds really good

527
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,120
He sounds so good you'd think he's going to be here for Linux Fest Northwest

528
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,120
But he's not

529
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
I really wanted to try and go

530
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
Really wanted to try and go

531
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
I know, I know

532
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
Maybe next year

533
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,120
Maybe next year

534
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
I think next year definitely

535
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,120
Maybe even present

536
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
Really?

537
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
That'd be really cool

538
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
Yeah you could go

539
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Totally Wimpy

540
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Oh my gosh don't tease

541
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
I would like that a lot

542
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
Alright so if you are going to make it

543
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Check out meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting

544
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,120
And you'll find the Linux Fest Northwest event there

545
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,120
Let us know if you're going

546
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,120
And also if you'd like to maybe volunteer for Linux Fest Northwest

547
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
They do have a contact page

548
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
Linux Fest Northwest slash contact

549
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
And you can give them your info

550
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,120
Maybe you got something you can help them do

551
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
That'd be kind of cool

552
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
Just give them a mention

553
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
Alright

554
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
So I want to talk about this hardware device

555
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
This

556
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
It's made it on

557
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,120
It's like one of the top stories in our subreddit this week

558
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,120
It's called the Onion Omega

559
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,120
And it looks like it's smaller than a USB thumb drive

560
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,120
I'd say it's a little bit bigger than a quarter

561
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,120
And it's kind of amazing

562
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,120
It's a tiny but powerful Linux

563
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,120
With Wi-Fi

564
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
An app store

565
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
You'd think those Chrome sticks look interesting

566
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,120
They got nothing

567
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
They got nothing on this thing

568
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
So I want to show this to you guys

569
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
And see if this could be a viable thing

570
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
And if it is

571
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Maybe

572
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
Well maybe we'll get one

573
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,120
And maybe we'll review it on the show

574
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,120
And put art on it

575
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
I mean matte

576
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
I mean

577
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
No I'm just kidding

578
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,120
But first I'm going to tell you about our friends over at Ting

579
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,120
Go to linux.ting.com

580
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,120
linux.ting.com

581
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,120
That'll take $25 off your first device

582
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,120
Or you know what

583
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,120
You probably have a device that works with Ting

584
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,120
Because they just take all these GSM devices now

585
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,120
And they take a whole bunch of CDMA devices

586
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,120
So if you got a device that already works with Ting

587
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,120
They'll give you $25 service credit

588
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
Wait you don't know what Ting is?

589
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,120
Oh my gosh

590
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,120
How did you not hear about the best thing to happen to mobile ever?

591
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
I'm serious

592
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,120
Ting is really here to shake up the mobile duopoly

593
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
It's mobile that makes sense

594
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,120
No contracts

595
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,120
You only pay for what you use

596
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,120
Flat $6 dollars for that line

597
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
You want a new line on your Ting?

598
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,120
Boom

599
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
$6 dollars

600
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
$6 dollars

601
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,120
That is less than a sandwich these days

602
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
For a cell phone line

603
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,120
$6 dollars a month in your usage on top

604
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,120
They have a kick ass dashboard

605
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
That totally dominates all the other carriers dashboards

606
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,120
It takes their dashboards

607
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,120
And smashes them into the ground by the face

608
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,120
It is such a great dashboard

609
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,120
But then to like lap them

610
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
They have no hold customer service

611
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
You call that Ting at 1855 Ting FTW

612
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
Any time between 8am or 8pm

613
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
And a human answers the phone

614
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
And that human is empowered to solve your problems

615
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
You know why?

616
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,120
Because they're like hey here's an idea

617
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,120
Let's hire Android geeks to do our Android phone support

618
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,120
Let's hire iOS fanboys to do our iOS support

619
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
So you get the enthusiasts

620
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,120
And then they said hey you know what

621
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,120
Let's give them the ability to actually just solve the problem on their first call

622
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,120
Solve the problem on their first call

623
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
What a freaking concept

624
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,120
What a freaking concept

625
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
That's Ting

626
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
And they just like

627
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
That kind of just very straight forward logic applies to everything

628
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,120
I'll give you another example

629
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
You want hotspot and tethering?

630
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
Turn it on

631
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
Just check the box

632
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
That's why Google built it into the OS

633
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,120
And that's why Apple built it into the OS

634
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,120
And probably Microsoft does it

635
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
I don't know what Microsoft does

636
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,120
Anyway that's why it's there

637
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,120
You should just be able to turn it on

638
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,120
It's a wireless ISP

639
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,120
You want to treat Ting like a wireless ISP?

640
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
Do it bro

641
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,120
Go for it sister

642
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
I don't care

643
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,120
I'm not judging you

644
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,120
Because you're only paying for what you use

645
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,120
They take your minutes

646
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
They take your megabytes

647
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
And that's it

648
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
Go to linux.ting.com to get started

649
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,120
I'll tell you how crazy like a Fox Ting is too

650
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,120
Look up over on their blog post right now

651
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,120
Ting Tip for Android

652
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,120
Make calls through Hangouts for free

653
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,120
They talk about this app

654
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,120
That's in the Play Store

655
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,120
That just sets up your dialer to use the Hangouts app

656
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,120
So when you just make calls

657
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,120
And you dial phone numbers on your Android phone

658
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,120
It just routes the call through Hangouts

659
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,120
So all your calls are free

660
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,120
Now that's going to cost Ting money

661
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,120
They're going to make less money off you

662
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,120
Because you are not going to use as many cellular minutes

663
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,120
You're going to be making your calls over Wi-Fi

664
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,120
That's crazy like a Fox

665
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
That's Ting

666
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
linux.ting.com

667
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,120
Go check them out

668
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,120
Been my mobile service provider for well over two years now

669
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,120
linux.ting.com

670
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,120
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program

671
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,120
You crazy Foxes over there

672
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,120
You keep it up

673
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,120
You keep it up

674
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,120
And I can't wait to get myself a brand new spanking Android phone soon

675
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,120
And put it on the Ting GSM network

676
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,120
linux.ting.com

677
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,120
Alright so this is maybe the coolest thing ever

678
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,120
We've shown many hardware devices on the Unplugged show

679
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,120
In fact I want to show more

680
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,120
But we've also shown many a Kickstarter

681
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,120
Many a Kickstarter

682
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,120
But you guys

683
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:19,120
Not only is this one of the coolest Kickstarter devices we have ever seen on the show

684
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,120
I think this is the best Kickstarter video I have ever seen

685
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,120
At least for anything that runs Linux

686
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,120
So here it is

687
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,120
The tiny but powerful Linux Wi-Fi development board

688
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,120
With 166 backers

689
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,120
It's currently at $5,285

690
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,120
At a $15,000 goal

691
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,120
A nice modest goal

692
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,120
$15,000

693
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
That's modest

694
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
34 days to go

695
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
Here we go

696
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Check this thing out

697
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,120
This is so, so freaking cool

698
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,120
And I think I gotta give mad props for a great Kickstarter video as well

699
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,120
There are two worlds

700
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,120
The real world

701
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,120
And the digital

702
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,120
And then there's the cat world

703
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,120
Oh the lovely cat world

704
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,120
The problem with the two worlds is that

705
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,120
In order to connect objects in the real world with the digital world

706
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,120
You need to be a rocket scientist

707
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,120
Or some sort of physicist from the Manhattan Project

708
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,120
Or one of those brains in a jar

709
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,120
But not anymore

710
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:28,120
Meet Onion

711
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,120
For the past year

712
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:34,120
We've been hard at work building something that's small, affordable

713
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,120
And really easy to use

714
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,120
So that we can merge the two worlds together

715
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,120
We wanted to be like Tony Stark

716
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,120
And be able to build whatever comes to our mind

717
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,120
Without learning how to build these things

718
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,120
And that is exactly why we created this

719
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,120
The Onion Omega

720
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,120
Thanks Oliver

721
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,120
It's a tiny computer with built-in Wi-Fi

722
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,120
And it runs the Linux operating system

723
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:04,120
This little bad boy lets you create connected devices

724
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,120
In environments that you're already familiar with

725
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,120
Using tools such as SSH, Git, and MPM

726
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:15,120
And it also allows you to write software in Python, Node.js, PHP

727
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,120
Or whatever language you feel comfortable with

728
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,120
You now have the power to build anything you can imagine

729
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,120
Such as smart home devices

730
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,120
Security drones

731
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Security spiders

732
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,120
What?

733
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:35,120
I don't want that, I do not want that, I do not want that, I do not want that!

734
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:41,120
Or even a cat feeder

735
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,120
A cat feeder that realizes your cat is too fat

736
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,120
With a laser?

737
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,120
And then makes it exercise

738
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,120
Laser pointer

739
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,120
Or if you don't want to build from scratch

740
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,120
You can browse the Onion app store for ready-made apps

741
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:58,120
In fact, if you want to see what you can build on the Omega right now

742
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:03,120
Click on the live demo below and start to experience the Omega in real time

743
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,120
I want the cat stuff, that's cool

744
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,120
Yeah, okay, so this is the Omega Onion

745
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,120
And I'm telling you, it's the future

746
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,120
You're going to have one of these in your backpack

747
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,120
You're going to have one of these in your, I don't know, your milk jug

748
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,120
This thing is nuts, it's tiny

749
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:24,120
It is one fourth the size of a Raspberry Pi

750
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,120
Wow, it's ridiculous

751
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,120
It's got a full Linux environment

752
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,120
Full Linux environment, they say, with a powerful processor

753
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:33,120
Capable of running the full Linux operating system

754
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,120
That is just

755
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,120
I mean, it's just the stuff you can do with it

756
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,120
And the ready-made apps, that's going to make this work

757
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,120
That's what's going to make this work for people

758
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
Yeah, the app store is

759
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,120
Because someone like me that's lazy

760
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,120
It's just like, I just want the cool stuff, you know

761
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,120
Right, yeah, that is actually a pretty good point

762
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,120
And it comes with a pretty nice little UI out of the box where you can load stuff

763
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,120
To me, this looks like a

764
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:57,120
Finally a version of this kind of

765
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,120
Tech that might be more approachable to somebody like me

766
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,120
Whereas I think the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino boards

767
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,120
And the BeagleBone Black are super cool

768
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:09,120
But I just, I am not inventive enough to see them and come up with something

769
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,120
Right, but this

770
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,120
But this

771
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,120
This looks a little more approachable to me

772
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
I don't know, a number of them

773
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,120
Any thoughts, would you guys back something like this?

774
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,120
The prices, here, I'll give you the prices

775
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,120
And you guys tell me what you think, okay?

776
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,120
So here's your backing prices

777
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,120
If you just want to get in sort of cheapo style, you know

778
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,120
Like low rent

779
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,120
You could just

780
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,120
You could get

781
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,120
Oh, they're all gone

782
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,120
They did start at $19

783
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,120
They're all gone now

784
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,120
For $25, you get an Omega and a dock

785
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,120
$35, you get an Omega and a dock

786
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,120
And a dock or expansion

787
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,120
But you really start cooking when you get up to 99 bucks

788
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,120
99 bucks, you get a camera kit

789
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,120
Which is, you get an Omega and a dock

790
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,120
A camera kit

791
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,120
A tilt mount

792
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,120
A servo

793
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,120
An Omega servo

794
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
And accessory instructions

795
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,120
And wiring

796
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,120
And then it just keeps going up

797
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Like $109, you get the printer kit

798
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,120
$119, you get all that stuff

799
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,120
And a starter kit

800
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,120
And essential items to build something else

801
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,120
You know, like everything, you get more and more stuff

802
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,120
So it's a pretty straightforward pricing structure

803
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,120
Starting as, you know

804
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,120
You can go as low as $35

805
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,120
Or really $25 for a little bit longer

806
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,120
There's only 21 spots left, I think

807
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,120
But, you know

808
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
I don't know

809
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,120
My thoughts

810
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,120
Seems like a pretty reasonable price for a pretty interesting device

811
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,120
Yes? No?

812
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,120
I'm not really happy with the software

813
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,120
Well, I think it is

814
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,120
What was that? I'm sorry

815
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,120
What about the software?

816
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,120
They've kind of made their own Onion Cloud

817
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
Yes

818
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,120
Own lab

819
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,120
Yes

820
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,120
Own everything

821
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,120
Yes

822
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,120
I'm not sure how future proof it is

823
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,120
If they're only a small company

824
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,120
It's actually a pretty fair critique, actually

825
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,120
I have two reasons

826
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,120
Okay

827
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,120
Two things

828
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,120
One

829
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,120
Called the Onion Omega

830
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,120
Yes

831
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,120
Which, I mean, it gets points right there

832
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,120
And then two

833
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,120
The guy almost sounded like Morgan Freeman

834
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,120
Yeah, yeah, that's great, right?

835
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,120
Strategic viewpoints

836
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,120
So just based on those two things

837
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,120
I guess you almost have to

838
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,120
See, okay, that was what I was thinking

839
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,120
Is the Morgan Freeman really did it for me

840
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,120
I thought, I like this idea too because

841
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,120
You know, last week we talked about

842
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,120
Oh, I should follow up on that too

843
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,120
Last week we talked about a computer for my kid

844
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,120
And I think it was Wimpy that recommended

845
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,120
You know, get him a computer

846
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,120
But maybe also get him a Raspberry Pi

847
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,120
I think that was you, right, Wimpy?

848
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,120
What do you think about this

849
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,120
As opposed to the Raspberry Pi for kids?

850
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,120
Well, this is, I think, the step on

851
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,120
From the Raspberry Pi, isn't it?

852
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,120
This is the next level of

853
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,120
DIY computing and experimentation

854
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,120
So yeah, definitely something

855
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,120
When you've surpassed the initial novelty

856
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,120
Of the Raspberry Pi

857
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,120
And using it a bit more like a traditional computer

858
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,120
And you want to get into robotics

859
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,120
And actually embed a device in something

860
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,120
Or, you know, motorize small things

861
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,120
Then this looks like a neat solution for that

862
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,120
And not too expensive

863
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,120
Lots of language support as well

864
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,120
And I see Python in there

865
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,120
Which of course you're soon going to be an expert in

866
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,120
So that'll be good

867
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,120
Oh, I see, although now they're trying to

868
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,120
Get me back onto Ruby again

869
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,120
Don't do that, don't do that to yourself

870
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,120
You know, so a follow up

871
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,120
I wanted to get a computer for my son

872
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,120
And I had an exchange

873
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,120
With our friends at System76

874
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,120
Now I won't say who

875
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,120
But I got like an Apple-style rumor for you

876
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,120
You ready for this?

877
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,120
Rumor has it

878
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
Now I cannot confirm or deny this

879
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,120
But rumor has it

880
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,120
On Thursday of this week

881
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,120
So let's see, what day is that going to be?

882
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,120
So this is Tuesday the 31st

883
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,120
So on April

884
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,120
Oh yeah, it's probably a good idea

885
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,120
They don't do it on April

886
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:52,120
Yeah, so on April 2nd

887
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,120
A new System76 laptop is going to be announced

888
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,120
That's the rumor

889
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,120
That's the rumor

890
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,120
And so it might be the perfect machine for my son

891
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,120
And I might have first dibs on it

892
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,120
These all might be things that are true

893
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,120
They may or may not

894
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
So we'll see

895
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,120
And then if they do have a new laptop

896
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,120
That releases this Thursday

897
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,120
Then we'll probably have one of the first reviews

898
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,120
Because I think I'm going to have one of the first units

899
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,120
On the Linux action show

900
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
So that was

901
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,120
Oh, that's awesome

902
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
I decided to go with a laptop

903
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,120
So that way he could come to the studio

904
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,120
And you know

905
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,120
I'll probably make him use this machine for like 5, 6 years

906
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,120
Or he'll use it for a couple of years

907
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,120
And then his sisters will use it for a couple of years

908
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,120
As they get a little bit older

909
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,120
So yeah

910
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,120
Hopefully that will work out pretty good for him

911
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,120
I think he'll like it quite a bit

912
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,120
And I think it's going to be the perfect machine for him too

913
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,120
So yeah

914
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,120
I really call

915
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,120
I'm really nice to him

916
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,120
I was really nice to him

917
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,120
So what do you think?

918
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,120
Should we back this Onion Omega?

919
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,120
What do you guys

920
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,120
I could go in

921
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,120
I could go in for 25 bucks

922
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,120
Is it worth backing to see if we could get one for the show?

923
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,120
I think so

924
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,120
I mean I think just based on the fact that it said

925
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,120
Hey Chris, would you like to be your own Tony Stark?

926
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,120
I think they kind of win there

927
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,120
So I would say yeah

928
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,120
I would like to be my own Tony Stark man

929
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,120
That is

930
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,120
Yeah

931
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,120
Yeah

932
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,120
All right

933
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,120
Do it

934
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,120
Chatroom says do it

935
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,120
Mumble room

936
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,120
Anybody want to say don't do it?

937
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,120
Anybody want to vote for not backing this project?

938
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,120
Speak now or forever hold your peace

939
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,120
I'm going to do it

940
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,120
There you go

941
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,120
Wow

942
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,120
Okay

943
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,120
There we go

944
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,120
I'm going to back

945
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,120
I'm backing it right now

946
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,120
I'll back it $25

947
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,120
And because I feel like $25 is totally worth it

948
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,120
If we can have it here on the show

949
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,120
So

950
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:22,120
And I've just bought a device that you can use to exploit your new found Python skills

951
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,120
You're really pushing me in that direction

952
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,120
There you go

953
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,120
I feel slight amount of pressure to go in a certain direction

954
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,120
You'll learn something Chris

955
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,120
We'll back you in a way or what

956
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,120
Oh man all right

957
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,120
So there we go

958
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,120
I just backed it

959
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,120
And I felt good

960
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,120
I feel like that was a good choice

961
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,120
Like at first I wasn't sure if that was a good choice

962
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,120
But then I remembered that I wanted to be Tony Stark

963
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,120
And then I felt like a good choice

964
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,120
And I also want Morgan Freeman to narrate my decisions

965
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,120
And all decisions I make

966
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,120
So that sort of sealed the deal for me

967
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,120
And if you'd like to as well

968
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,120
I mean they only have a couple slots left at the $25

969
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,120
And then it starts getting expensive

970
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,120
But there we go woo-hoo

971
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,120
I mean at the $35 level

972
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,120
That's a pretty good deal

973
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,120
Because you get basically the same components

974
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,120
Now you tell me

975
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,120
As the

976
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,120
You can opt to get the network card

977
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:16,120
And then you get the same components as the Raspberry Pi basically

978
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,120
Now you tell me

979
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,120
After I just backed the $25 one

980
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,120
Dude way too late on the commentary

981
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,120
Way too late

982
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,120
No kidding right

983
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,120
I should have mentioned it earlier

984
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,120
I was going to mention it earlier

985
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,120
But then I was like eh

986
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,120
No you got to mention that

987
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,120
I pulled the trigger

988
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,120
Should I cancel it

989
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,120
Can you cancel a Kickstarter

990
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,120
Is that like a

991
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,120
What's that called when you back something

992
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,120
And then you pull out

993
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:36,120
What's that called

994
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,120
Are you talking about on Kickstarter

995
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,120
In real life

996
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,120
Oh on Kickstarter

997
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,120
You're not completely pulling out

998
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,120
You're just pulling out

999
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,120
And giving them more money instead

1000
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,120
Yeah I should leave a note like

1001
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,120
You can just give them more

1002
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,120
And they'll upgrade

1003
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,120
The former is called birth control

1004
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,120
Yeah I should just send them a note like

1005
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,120
This is not

1006
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,120
I'm not judging you with this cancellation

1007
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,120
I love you

1008
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,120
Really I'm just giving you more money

1009
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,120
I'm sorry

1010
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,120
No I think it's fine

1011
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,120
$25 is fine

1012
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,120
I think you can do it

1013
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,120
That's fine

1014
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,120
No 25 is

1015
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,120
I don't

1016
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,120
Well that's

1017
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,120
It's not too committal

1018
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,120
You get in there early

1019
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,120
If they grow cool

1020
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,120
You can always add to it right

1021
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,120
Yeah I suppose

1022
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,120
I suppose

1023
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,120
Yeah

1024
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,120
I mean it's just

1025
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,120
Tell yourself that

1026
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,120
Yeah

1027
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,120
Yeah

1028
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:20,120
Yeah I just wanted something for the show

1029
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,120
Okay alright well

1030
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,120
Ah jeez

1031
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,120
If you want

1032
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,120
If you want it

1033
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,120
Oh you know what we need

1034
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,120
That's why he has three kids

1035
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,120
Wow

1036
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,120
Wow

1037
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,120
You can change your pledge

1038
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,120
Okay

1039
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,120
Alright so maybe I'll do that

1040
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,120
I don't know

1041
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,120
We'll save that for the post show

1042
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,120
If I remember

1043
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,120
Yeah there you go

1044
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,120
That's probably a good point

1045
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,120
Okay so we might have a little ass kicking

1046
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:39,120
That we need to be handed to us

1047
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,120
And we got a couple of good notes that came into the show

1048
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,120
Okay

1049
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:48,120
And Ryan did our friend from Evolvo S show up?

1050
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,120
Easier

1051
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,120
Okay who's that?

1052
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,120
Ikey

1053
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,120
Hi Ikey

1054
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,120
Hi Ikey

1055
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,120
Hi Ikey welcome to the show

1056
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,120
Oh thanks

1057
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,120
And you're with Evolvo S?

1058
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,120
That's one way of putting it yeah

1059
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,120
Okay well you are Evolvo S?

1060
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,120
Yeah for the most part yeah

1061
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,120
Yeah okay alright well good I'm really glad you're here because

1062
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:11,120
You could give us a great perspective on this I think discussion we're about to have

1063
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:16,120
And really which sort of translates into how much attention do we give distributions

1064
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,120
That maybe don't have a larger user base as some of the other ones

1065
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,120
Which obviously translates into audience interest

1066
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,120
So it's kind of a tricky topic for us

1067
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:27,120
But because you know part of the goal of our show is to give exposure to things

1068
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,120
That deserve more exposure that aren't currently getting it

1069
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,120
It's something I feel it's worth reevaluating pretty frequently

1070
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,120
I don't want to make it obnoxious

1071
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,120
But because you the listener have a bit of a stake in this

1072
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,120
I think it's probably good we just have this discussion with our lug on the record

1073
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,120
So you know where if there's a bias where it lies which there isn't one

1074
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:48,120
But you at least know the logic and the process that goes into selecting what we coverage

1075
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,120
What we cover and what dictates that coverage

1076
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,120
So before we do that I'll thank our third sponsor this week

1077
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,120
And that's DigitalOcean

1078
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,120
Now this is the secret right here

1079
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,120
You want to make yourself look like a boss

1080
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,120
You want to offer out client services

1081
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,120
You want to have a great back end infrastructure

1082
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,120
You want to make sure your website runs super fast

1083
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,120
You want to make sure your project looks smart

1084
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,120
You want to have your own domain

1085
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,120
You want to get your data off some cloud service

1086
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,120
You want to do it right it's DigitalOcean

1087
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,120
I'll tell you why DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider

1088
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,120
Dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you

1089
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,120
To spin up your own cloud server

1090
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,120
You're going to have root access with an HTML5 console

1091
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:19,120
And through a great interface I'll tell you about

1092
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,120
And all of it you can get started right now

1093
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,120
In super super no time like super flat no time

1094
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:26,120
It's crazy and you can try it out two months for absolutely free

1095
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,120
We use our promo code

1096
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,120
We got a special promo code for the unplug show

1097
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,120
It's D.O. Unplugged

1098
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,120
D.O. Unplugged all lower case one word

1099
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,120
Gets you a $10 credit over DigitalOcean

1100
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,120
Find out about DigitalOcean

1101
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,120
Just go try it with that promo code

1102
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,120
Because there's no cost up front

1103
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,120
You're not going to need a credit card

1104
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,120
And you can get started in less than 55 seconds

1105
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,120
You'll have a server for less than $5 a month

1106
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,120
Or about $5 a month

1107
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,120
I actually have three servers and I like it a lot

1108
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,120
Because I just apply a balance to my account

1109
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,120
And this is I think a really great system

1110
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,120
Because I have a few PayPal accounts

1111
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,120
And one I use for Steam purchases

1112
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,120
And that PayPal account that I use for Steam purchases

1113
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,120
I just also sometimes have a couple extra bucks

1114
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,120
After I buy the Steam games

1115
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,120
And I'll just send them over to my DigitalOcean account

1116
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,120
But you can use our promo code D.O. Unplugged

1117
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,120
And you get a $10 credit

1118
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,120
And you can try out the $5 rig for free

1119
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,120
Here's what you're going to get for $5

1120
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,120
512 megabytes of RAM

1121
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,120
A 20 gigabyte SSD

1122
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,120
One CPU

1123
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,120
And a terabyte of transfer

1124
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,120
A terabyte

1125
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,120
They're all SSDs too

1126
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,120
They did that early on

1127
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,120
And I think that's a really smart move

1128
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:22,120
And made them really competitive

1129
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,120
And they've got data center locations in New York

1130
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,120
San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and London

1131
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,120
But their interface is really great

1132
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,120
The DigitalOcean control panel is like their secret sauce

1133
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,120
It sits on top of their great connectivity

1134
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,120
Their excellent data centers

1135
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,120
They're all SSD I.O.

1136
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,120
Of course, Linux

1137
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,120
The KVM virtualizer

1138
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,120
Which as you know is the best out there

1139
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,120
Come on, what's up

1140
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,120
Come on, you know that

1141
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,120
All of that rides on top

1142
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,120
All of that is just controlled by this

1143
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,120
This interface is just amazing

1144
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,120
It's the best out there

1145
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,120
It's very intuitive

1146
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,120
And you can replicate its functionality on a larger scale

1147
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,120
With DigitalOcean's very straightforward API

1148
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,120
Which a lot of the community is already doing

1149
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,120
You can take advantage of the stuff that's already out there

1150
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,120
You can do DNS management

1151
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,120
You can take care of your snapshots

1152
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,120
Back things up

1153
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,120
Destroy them

1154
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,120
Use the template to get started even faster

1155
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,120
Use one-click deployments to get Ruby on Rails going

1156
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,120
Docker, GitLab

1157
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,120
All kinds of stuff

1158
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,120
Ghost, WordPress

1159
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,120
The list is just always growing

1160
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,120
So much good stuff

1161
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,120
And use the promo code dounplug

1162
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,120
Try it out two months for free

1163
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,120
dounplug

1164
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,120
One word lowercase

1165
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,120
Head over to DigitalOcean

1166
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:19,120
Try it out

1167
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,120
Check out their tutorials as well

1168
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,120
They're really top notch

1169
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,120
DigitalOcean.com

1170
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,120
dounplug

1171
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,120
Get the $10 credit

1172
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,120
And a big thanks to DigitalOcean

1173
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:29,120
For sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program

1174
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,120
It's a really good service

1175
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,120
Okay, so let's talk about our coverage

1176
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,120
So we've kind of got Gabriel 3 in the subreddit

1177
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,120
Kicks it off

1178
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,120
He says, hi there, Chris, Matt, Noah, JB Producers

1179
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,120
Mumble Room

1180
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,120
Fellow community members

1181
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,120
On the latest Linux Unplugged episode

1182
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,120
Chris announced a roundtable on distro coverage criteria

1183
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,120
In my opinion, it's worth to express our thoughts

1184
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,120
On this as a community too

1185
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,120
He wanted to kind of work through this

1186
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,120
You know, you have mainstream distros

1187
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,120
You have new distros

1188
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,120
Third derivative distros that are beginner friendly

1189
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,120
Fifth is, you know, he says you also have

1190
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,120
Fifth, despite Chris and JB's good will

1191
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,120
Some interesting distros will not be covered

1192
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,120
Because there are hundreds of distros

1193
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,120
It's quite impossible

1194
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,120
That's very true

1195
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,120
So he started off a pretty good conversation

1196
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,120
And folks, you know, sort of kicked in

1197
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,120
Like some people want to see more coverage on NixOS

1198
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,120
And I wasn't so sure I wanted to get into the specific distros

1199
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,120
We should be covering

1200
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,120
Although we can talk about specific distros

1201
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:25,120
But I wanted to talk a little bit about

1202
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,120
Sort of the selection criteria

1203
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,120
And then maybe Aiki can chime in with what he thinks about it

1204
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:32,120
From somebody who's maybe tried to get more attention

1205
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,120
From a media outlet

1206
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,120
So our selection usually is based on what we perceive

1207
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,120
To probably generate the most interest in the audience

1208
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,120
And also has to be something we have experience with

1209
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,120
Or use ourselves to some degree to be able to review it

1210
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,120
And that depends

1211
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:47,120
Like so, you know, we'll try out an op

1212
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,120
We'll try out a distro for a couple of weeks

1213
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,120
That we don't actually run just to do a review

1214
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,120
But things that are more in our wheelhouse

1215
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,120
Are going to be stuff that's closer to our daily run

1216
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,120
So that's sort of

1217
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,120
If there is a bias, that would be it

1218
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,120
And then what we select

1219
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,120
The only real selection criteria is if it interests us

1220
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,120
And we think it might interest the audience

1221
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,120
So sometimes we will feature something

1222
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,120
That maybe the audience has never heard of

1223
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:09,120
But we think, ah, based on what we think they're going to like

1224
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,120
Once they find out about this

1225
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,120
It'll pique their interest

1226
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,120
And so we'll run it

1227
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:16,120
But that does mean that certain things kind of get left out

1228
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,120
More often than not

1229
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:23,120
Distributions that maybe you could label as less relevant

1230
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,120
But I don't really feel like that's fair

1231
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,120
Because even a really small distribution

1232
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,120
Can have something very innovative going on

1233
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:34,120
But it's maybe distributions that have a much lower user base

1234
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,120
I don't know exactly how to say this

1235
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,120
That sounds about right to me

1236
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:39,120
Yeah, you know what I'm trying to go here, right?

1237
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,120
Yeah, yeah

1238
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,120
Yeah

1239
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,120
Something that makes

1240
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,120
Ryan, you have an idea of what makes something coverable?

1241
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:49,120
Yeah, there are derivative distributions out there

1242
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:53,120
And a lot of distributions that build just ever so slightly

1243
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:57,120
On, you know, an innovation from its parent distro

1244
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,120
Which is fine

1245
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,120
But to me that doesn't make it necessarily worth covering

1246
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,120
I think you're right when you say

1247
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,120
You really want to cover a distro

1248
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,120
When it's doing something innovative and new

1249
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,120
And something that might actually be a game changer

1250
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:16,120
One reason I contribute to and enjoy Volvo S

1251
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,120
Is because they

1252
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,120
Aiki did a really great job of pulling out a lot of stuff

1253
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,120
And he built it on top of

1254
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:26,120
It's not a derivative of another distro necessarily

1255
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:29,120
Or at least not any living distros

1256
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:34,120
And really just rethought the whole desktop environment

1257
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,120
From the ground up

1258
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,120
Yeah, that's exciting

1259
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,120
And so when you look

1260
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,120
What I would like to hear as a five-year listener

1261
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,120
Of Jupiter Broadcasting is

1262
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,120
Is about distros that are doing something new and exciting

1263
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:51,120
Not necessarily every distro that pops up as a derivative

1264
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,120
I don't want to hear about the Ubuntu derivative

1265
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,120
Sorry, Opi and Wimpy

1266
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,120
Well, wait a minute

1267
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,120
Sometimes they're really good

1268
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,120
Well, if they are, then that's great

1269
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,120
I think Ubuntu Mate is worth hearing about

1270
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:07,120
Because, I mean, where are you going to go to try out Mate?

1271
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,120
You know, if you're not on Arch

1272
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,120
Or some place where you're just going to

1273
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,120
Throw it on your machine and go

1274
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,120
Everywhere, it's in every distribution

1275
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,120
But not done right, it's not done right, is it?

1276
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,120
Well, no, some distributions do it better than others

1277
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,120
But, you know

1278
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,120
Okay, so Aiki, coming from the

1279
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,120
You know, the Evolvo S perspective

1280
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,120
You probably don't hear Evolvo S mentioned as often as you'd like

1281
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,120
What are your thoughts on that sort of spot you get stuck in

1282
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,120
When you're a distribution of that size?

1283
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,120
Lovers

1284
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,120
Basically

1285
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,120
We wouldn't get a lot of attention

1286
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,120
So, what people are interested in now is

1287
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,120
Ooh, shiny

1288
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,120
So, I mean, I'm not going to point out

1289
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,120
Any specific distros at the moment

1290
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,120
Because, like, people listen to this

1291
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,120
And I'd get in trouble

1292
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,120
But people are really, really interested in the whole

1293
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,120
Design-led philosophy at the moment

1294
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,120
So, something's really, really pretty

1295
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,120
They take something else and basically whack a new skin on it

1296
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,120
And that's what people seem to be interested in

1297
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,120
So, for us

1298
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,120
I guess you could say in that way that we suffer

1299
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,120
Because, you know, I mean

1300
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,120
We've got the budget desktop and, you know, it's kind of sexy

1301
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:15,120
But people want all the shiny Google things

1302
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,120
Which we're not really doing

1303
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,120
We're more interested in making something that works

1304
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,120
So, yeah, we do have to work a bit harder

1305
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,120
But, unlike some of the other projects

1306
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,120
We're not actually

1307
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,120
Financially dependent on success

1308
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,120
Which kind of makes things a lot easier for us

1309
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,120
Like, we're not whacking a new wallpaper on and saying

1310
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,120
Can we have a donation?

1311
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,120
Because, you know, we look good

1312
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,120
So, it's easier for us in that respect

1313
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,120
And the thing that

1314
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,120
It seems to be the hump you have to find

1315
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,120
The hump to get over is

1316
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:48,120
That, oh, there's something interesting happening here

1317
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,120
And then once everybody kind of agrees

1318
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,120
Something interesting is happening here

1319
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,120
It seems like the coverage just sort of naturally starts rolling

1320
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,120
And so, why don't you tell us a little bit about

1321
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,120
Evolve OS and pique people's interest

1322
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,120
Because it looks super slick

1323
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,120
It looks really nice

1324
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,120
I mean, so it's got a bit of a history behind it

1325
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:06,120
So, I mean, a lot of people would know

1326
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,120
That I was, you know, involved in

1327
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:10,120
Well, involved in Solus West

1328
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:12,120
I was Solus West before all this

1329
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,120
So, what I did there is

1330
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,120
You know, we made a couple of mistakes along the way with Solus West

1331
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,120
One of the things I really, really, really wanted to do

1332
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,120
Is make something that only targeted the desktop

1333
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,120
Now, to a lot of people

1334
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,120
That's going to sound really stupid

1335
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,120
Because they'd be like, well, you can take Ubuntu or Fedora

1336
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,120
And just like, you know

1337
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,120
Only have a desktop on there

1338
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,120
The problem with those distributions

1339
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,120
They are very much generic

1340
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,120
Now, I don't mean that by way of an insult to those distributions

1341
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,120
But if we look at Debian

1342
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,120
It advertises itself as the universal distribution

1343
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,120
You know, it's the universal operating system

1344
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,120
You can use it anywhere

1345
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,120
To be fair, I mean

1346
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,120
I only have desktop machines

1347
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,120
And I really couldn't care less

1348
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:52,120
If I had the potential to run this on a Raspberry Pi

1349
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,120
Or something like that

1350
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,120
I just want to run a desktop machine

1351
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,120
I mean, it's great being able to do that

1352
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,120
But for me, I just want something that runs on what I have

1353
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,120
And that happens to be 64-bit machines

1354
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,120
That are desktops

1355
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,120
So, I only want a desktop on it

1356
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,120
I don't want to be able to run this like we have Apache

1357
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,120
And MySQL, and you know, all those carry-on

1358
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,120
Sorry, MariaDB

1359
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,120
Got to be politically correct

1360
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,120
Got to keep it hip

1361
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,120
But, you know, that's all I wanted

1362
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,120
So, it had to be very, very

1363
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,120
You know, it had to be trimmed from the get-go

1364
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,120
It couldn't have all these possible options

1365
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,120
So, you can only run Budgie Desktop on that

1366
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,120
That's all you're getting

1367
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,120
For anyone who doesn't know, Budgie Desktop is

1368
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,120
It's a GTKM modder-based desktop

1369
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,120
Similar to

1370
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,120
I guess similar to how Pantheon is implemented

1371
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,120
You know, where you just use the same libraries

1372
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,120
And basically piggyback on all that hard work

1373
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,120
To put it bluntly

1374
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,120
But another approach with this was

1375
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,120
Kind of to show people what you can do with GNOME

1376
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,120
So, you know, I mean

1377
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,120
GNOME has been forked so many times now

1378
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,120
That they're going to need to puncture a packet

1379
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,120
There's just loads of forks

1380
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:58,120
Like, flying around the place

1381
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,120
We wanted to show what you could do with the technology

1382
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:02,120
You know, it's a bit more work

1383
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,120
But in the end it pays off

1384
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,120
So, we've got a healthy upstream relationship with GNOME

1385
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,120
We contribute to GNOME

1386
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,120
I know I was supposed to be saying good GNOME

1387
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,120
But, you know, I have the remnants of an accent

1388
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,120
And that's just not happening

1389
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,120
I see, and you're linked to friends of GNOME here on your site

1390
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,120
Right here on the blog, which is nice

1391
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,120
Yeah, you've got to be nice

1392
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,120
You know, got to help them out

1393
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,120
I've got some bugs in them

1394
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,120
Sometimes they're not interesting bugs to the GNOME project

1395
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,120
So, I don't know about you guys

1396
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,120
But, like, I like to play Kerbal Space Program

1397
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,120
Because, you know, I'm so rad

1398
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,120
And cool

1399
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,120
This is not selling, is it?

1400
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,120
So, one of the problems that I actually found

1401
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,120
Is on older versions of GNOME

1402
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,120
Or GNOME Shell or, in our instance, Budgie

1403
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,120
Would just die

1404
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,120
Which was really, really oddly depressing

1405
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,120
I couldn't play Kerbal Space Program

1406
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,120
I had to fix for that and send the patch upstream

1407
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,120
And that's now living in mutter

1408
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,120
So, that's some of the stuff that we do

1409
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,120
That you wouldn't find in, say, a respin

1410
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,120
Where they add a new wallpaper on

1411
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,120
You know, there's not a lot of upstream stuff happening

1412
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,120
Whereas we build everything

1413
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,120
Right, yeah

1414
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,120
And that's a ton of work, I mean, that's the downside, right?

1415
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,120
Doesn't that seem like a huge, huge

1416
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,120
Never-ending amount of work?

1417
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:16,120
Yes and no

1418
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,120
So, I mean, when I was building LibreOffice

1419
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,120
Well, I mean

1420
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,120
I'm getting flashbacks now, that was hard

1421
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:26,120
I was ranting all over Google Plus

1422
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,120
About that, and then, you know

1423
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,120
Four hours into the build and it's like, yeah dude

1424
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,120
I needed this tool that I didn't tell you I needed

1425
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,120
Haha, thanks

1426
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,120
But, I mean, a lot of it is, you know

1427
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,120
People seem to think distribution building

1428
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,120
Is all about packaging, because that's the

1429
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,120
Concept we've been exposed to

1430
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,120
You know, you get all these packages and you put them together

1431
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,120
Well, to be honest, packaging is really boring

1432
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,120
So, if people tell you

1433
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,120
They like maintaining

1434
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,120
A load of packages and updating them

1435
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,120
They're either lying to you or

1436
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,120
You need to refer them to the local mental health unit

1437
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,120
Because, you know, it's

1438
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,120
Not nice to do it

1439
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,120
So, some of the stuff that we're tackling in Evolver West

1440
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,120
Is basically just to get rid of all that crap

1441
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,120
So, how does that work?

1442
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,120
So, how do security updates work? Is there a package management?

1443
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,120
Does it pull down updates or is it

1444
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,120
What? How does that system work?

1445
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,120
Okay, so, we're

1446
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,120
Using, I can't even say the name

1447
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,120
Of the package manager, because we've renamed it

1448
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,120
I guess you would

1449
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,120
Renounce it PC, but it's spelled

1450
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,120
P-I-S-I

1451
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,120
Yeah, anyway

1452
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,120
So, that was abandoned

1453
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,120
By Pardis Linux like a couple of years ago

1454
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,120
So, the way I was looking, I wasn't really

1455
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,120
I know it sounds bad, but I wasn't interested

1456
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:36,120
In package management itself

1457
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:38,120
Because I think that was really, really, really

1458
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,120
Boring. So, I mean, if you're looking for

1459
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,120
A real hardcore package manager that's got

1460
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,120
All the bells and whistles and all that kind of

1461
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:46,120
Stuff, then use Arch Linux or something

1462
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,120
That really care about their package manager

1463
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,120
Because I don't. I want

1464
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:52,120
To be able to install packages and update

1465
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,120
And, to me, that's what a package manager should do

1466
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,120
But I noticed, like, Firefox 37, which came out today

1467
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,120
Is available for Evolve OS already

1468
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:00,120
It is, because it takes me no

1469
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,120
Time to update it at all. So, the

1470
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,120
Thing that we want to do is make

1471
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,120
Everything really easy. So, it's

1472
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:08,120
About the development process, because it's

1473
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,120
Mainly me doing the packaging. I've also got Justin doing

1474
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,120
Packaging now. But, if I'm

1475
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,120
Going to spend hours doing packaging, then

1476
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,120
There's never going to be a feature in the

1477
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,120
Distribution. There's never going to be any

1478
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:20,120
Level of integration, which is pointless.

1479
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,120
So, if I'm super concerned about security fixes

1480
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,120
Should I maybe use something else? So, this is more

1481
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,120
About experimenting a little bit?

1482
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,120
Oh, no. We do security updates. So,

1483
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:30,120
I think it was just the other day that

1484
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,120
We did some glibc updates. There was

1485
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,120
Another one that went in yesterday. I'd have to check

1486
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,120
The git log, to be honest. But it's all off

1487
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,120
From git hub. So, one

1488
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,120
Of the projects that I've done in my

1489
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:42,120
Own work time, like in my own professional

1490
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,120
Work, is open source.

1491
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,120
And that's called CVE Check Tool.

1492
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,120
Now, that's usable by all projects. So,

1493
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,120
Yes, I made it for work, but I also

1494
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,120
Made sure that it worked for Evolver West as well.

1495
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:54,120
You know,

1496
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,120
You've got to do these things. So, I mean,

1497
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:58,120
That particular tool is something that's now been

1498
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,120
Used by Evolver West, and it uses the National

1499
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,120
Vulnerability database, which is synced

1500
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:04,120
Every three to four hours, and maps

1501
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,120
Into every source package we have in our

1502
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,120
Distribution. Which, to be fair,

1503
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,120
I mean, it's not the greatest number, but they'll then

1504
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,120
Tell us if we have any vulnerabilities, what we've patched,

1505
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,120
What we've addressed. You know, like

1506
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,120
The latest OpenSSL incident, it discovered

1507
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,120
That before it had

1508
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,120
Been formally announced. But it's

1509
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,120
It's all non-embargable

1510
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,120
TVs, but there is a process to it.

1511
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,120
You've got to have secure

1512
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,120
Up-to-date software, but we're not a rolling release.

1513
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,120
Right. So, it's

1514
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,120
So, there are points in time where

1515
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,120
I would sort of maybe reload

1516
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,120
After a certain new release, it wouldn't be necessarily

1517
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,120
Upgraded to that new release.

1518
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,120
Right, and, I mean, that's

1519
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,120
Kind of across that bridge when we get to it

1520
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,120
Situation, because we haven't done a one-to-two

1521
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,120
Yet, but ideally we want to make it

1522
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:48,120
An update that works, because, you know,

1523
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,120
Linux is notorious for it doing

1524
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,120
Between two major

1525
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,120
Releases, so we want to make sure that actually

1526
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,120
Does work when we go ahead and do that.

1527
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,120
That sounds really exciting. That sounds like a really interesting

1528
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,120
Does anybody in the mumble room have any questions

1529
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,120
For Ike?

1530
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,120
I think I'll

1531
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,120
Be able to download the ISO and give it a run.

1532
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:08,120
Sounds pretty fun. I think it's something I want to test out.

1533
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,120
I've actually got a machine in mind I'd like to pop it on there.

1534
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:12,120
It's going through the website, just kind of getting a

1535
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,120
Feel for it. I like the layout.

1536
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,120
I like where it's going. I think it's interesting, but it's

1537
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,120
Definitely something I want to immerse myself in for a little bit.

1538
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:20,120
Also,

1539
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,120
You guys would really probably want to

1540
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,120
Shout out our software center.

1541
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,120
It's pretty darn lightweight.

1542
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:28,120
It loads instantly.

1543
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,120
That's not a jab at anybody.

1544
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,120
But,

1545
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,120
Granted, right now

1546
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,120
It's still getting defied, kind of

1547
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,120
By our art team and our

1548
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,120
App developers.

1549
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:42,120
But we hope

1550
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,120
That it'll both look

1551
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,120
Sexy and be speedy

1552
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,120
Because nobody wants to wait whenever they're

1553
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,120
Ready to install a new package.

1554
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,120
And I'm really excited

1555
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:54,120
About what that could be in the future.

1556
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,120
Yeah, really.

1557
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,120
Wimpy, you had a question.

1558
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,120
Yeah, so, hello Ikey.

1559
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,120
I'm running Evolvo

1560
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:04,120
S on one of my laptops. It's one of

1561
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,120
The distributions that I tinker with

1562
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,120
And take a look at to see

1563
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,120
What inspiration I can draw

1564
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,120
From it. But I was wondering

1565
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,120
What's your long-term plans

1566
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:16,120
For the project? Where do you want to take it?

1567
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:18,120
And what's your drive and

1568
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,120
Motivation for making it?

1569
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,120
Sure, so I mean, I guess to

1570
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,120
Shorten the question that's basically

1571
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,120
Is it a hobby or is it something that's actually going to

1572
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:28,120
Go somewhere, right?

1573
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,120
Not necessarily, just

1574
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,120
Why are you making it and where do you want to take the

1575
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,120
Project?

1576
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,120
So for me personally, I've had

1577
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,120
A bit of a problem with Linux distributions

1578
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,120
For quite a while now.

1579
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,120
I've been around doing the whole

1580
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,120
Linux distro thing for a while.

1581
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,120
I kind of have a vision of what a

1582
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,120
Distribution should be and to me personally

1583
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,120
Nothing I use on the desktop

1584
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,120
Suits what I want.

1585
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,120
To me

1586
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,120
You should never have to open a terminal.

1587
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,120
Yes, I am a geek. I'm paid as a software

1588
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,120
Engineer. I use a terminal

1589
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,120
A lot. But I don't

1590
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,120
Believe I should be using that to do something as

1591
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:06,120
Stupid as make PulseAudio work again.

1592
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:08,120
Or to reload a configuration.

1593
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,120
I mean, the most common thing

1594
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,120
You see on any forum is just

1595
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,120
Open a terminal and type sudo apt-get install

1596
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,120
Or sudo yum this that and the other.

1597
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,120
You shouldn't be doing that. Everything should work

1598
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,120
From the get-go. So this isn't a packaging

1599
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,120
Effort. It really is like an integration

1600
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,120
And distribution effort.

1601
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,120
If you like the distribution

1602
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,120
Model when we go forward from

1603
01:04:28,120 --> 01:04:30,120
The stable release, you're looking at

1604
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,120
Basically two years support per release

1605
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,120
Because it should keep working.

1606
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,120
And why should everyone keep updating?

1607
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,120
Because things just don't get that exciting

1608
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,120
In two years.

1609
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,120
So for rolling release distros, that's all

1610
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,120
Well and nice, but I personally don't

1611
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:46,120
Want to deal with a breakage in libpng.

1612
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,120
And I don't think anyone else does.

1613
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,120
To me

1614
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,120
For users, the thing that are really important

1615
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,120
Is like, is my firefox

1616
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:56,120
Browser two years out of date?

1617
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,120
No. Great. Do I have VLC?

1618
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,120
Is it recent? Do I have all

1619
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:02,120
The support I need? Yes. Brilliant.

1620
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,120
And going forward, we can have things like

1621
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,120
Automatic driver management, which is basically

1622
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,120
A given now.

1623
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,120
But there's other things going on behind the scenes

1624
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:12,120
Like backup and things like that.

1625
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:14,120
Cool.

1626
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,120
It's just a silly little thing.

1627
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,120
So one thing that's always got me

1628
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,120
And I don't know about you guys, but when you boot up

1629
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,120
Now and you look at grob on any single distro

1630
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:24,120
You've got a recovery option, right?

1631
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,120
Now, what if grob

1632
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:28,120
Is gone?

1633
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,120
Yes, yes.

1634
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,120
I've actually experienced that, yes.

1635
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,120
Right, so

1636
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,120
It's a completely redundant option.

1637
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,120
And you look at package manager

1638
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:40,120
So I mean the package manager that we basically inherited

1639
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,120
And slash forked, if you like

1640
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,120
I mean it's got options to do like

1641
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:46,120
It's got rollback, which you know, that's absolutely great

1642
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,120
But that needs to roll back from the internet

1643
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:50,120
So if I push out an update

1644
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,120
Say, I don't know, and I broke network manager

1645
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:54,120
Which I totally didn't do a couple

1646
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,120
Of months ago

1647
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:58,120
Yeah, that was well awkward

1648
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,120
But

1649
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,120
You know, I mean you're absolutely screwed

1650
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,120
You have no network connectivity

1651
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,120
That that's gone, or let's say like, you know

1652
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:08,120
Grob is gone, or you've corrupted

1653
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,120
The first few blocks of your hard drive. You're absolutely

1654
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,120
Notly screwed. So I don't see

1655
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,120
Anything out there at the moment that's solving them for

1656
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,120
Yes, there's no like, immediate

1657
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:18,120
Recovery option. There isn't the whole thing you have

1658
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,120
Windows, yeah I mentioned Windows

1659
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,120
People can burn me, I don't care, it's cool

1660
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,120
But

1661
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,120
You don't have realistic recovery options

1662
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,120
You don't

1663
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,120
I mean, what's the most common thing people do?

1664
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,120
Oh no, that's screwed, I'm going to reinstall it. Well no

1665
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:34,120
You have to think in the concept like, I mean

1666
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,120
You know, I'm not making a product here, I'm really not

1667
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,120
But you have to think along the lines that this is a product

1668
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,120
And you have to imagine as if it was

1669
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:42,120
An OEM installation, they have

1670
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:44,120
No disk to reinstall it, what are they going to do?

1671
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,120
So you have to start thinking of solutions like that

1672
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,120
How are these people going to get by for the next 2 years

1673
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,120
With no recovery disk, you don't want them

1674
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,120
To reinstall, and you have to be able to solve the problems

1675
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:54,120
You need to be able to roll back somewhere

1676
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:56,120
So that's the kind of things that we want to address in the Volvo West

1677
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:58,120
Longevity of an installation

1678
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,120
Basically. Very nice

1679
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,120
Lael, you wanted to ask a question?

1680
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,120
Yeah

1681
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,120
My question is this

1682
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,120
I notice in

1683
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,120
I mean, most of the distros I've tried

1684
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,120
Right now I am on Ubuntu Mate

1685
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:14,120
Most of the distros I've tried

1686
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,120
Whether in VirtualBox or actually on my

1687
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,120
System

1688
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:20,120
They require you to

1689
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,120
Type in the command prompt to resolve

1690
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:24,120
Dependencies, how does your

1691
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,120
Distribution answer the question

1692
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,120
Of resolving dependency through

1693
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,120
Installing it through your package manager?

1694
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:32,120
So

1695
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,120
The package manager is something we basically wanted

1696
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,120
To extract, I mean you can use it from a terminal

1697
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:38,120
That's really really fine, if that, you know, that's what

1698
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,120
Gets you going, more than fine doing that

1699
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:42,120
But I mean, it works the same as any other package manager

1700
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:44,120
You have binary dependencies

1701
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:46,120
When we build our packages, that's actually

1702
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,120
Automatic at runtime, similar to RPM

1703
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,120
So there's a binary dependency

1704
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,120
By a shared library, that's automatic

1705
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,120
So dependency resolution, all that stuff

1706
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:56,120
You know, works the same as any other

1707
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,120
Distro, but we don't really want people to use

1708
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,120
That, because that's dull, boring

1709
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:02,120
And what not, you know, not what

1710
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,120
Quote, normal people

1711
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,120
Do, so you'd have a graphical software

1712
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,120
Manager where you get everything done

1713
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:10,120
But yeah, dependencies and everything, that's all

1714
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:12,120
Automatic, and there's one

1715
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,120
Place that we do differ, to say

1716
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,120
Ubuntu or Debian

1717
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,120
We avoid package conflicts

1718
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,120
So, in the

1719
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,120
Likes, especially things like

1720
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,120
Build dependencies, which, you know, not applicable

1721
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,120
To a user, but in Debian you have

1722
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,120
Like libjpeg, and you have libjpeg

1723
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,120
Turbo, which both conflict with each

1724
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,120
Other, with us we'll just choose one

1725
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,120
And we'll use that across the entire distribution

1726
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,120
So you won't install something, it's like, ah

1727
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:38,120
But you need to remove those 49 packages

1728
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,120
And probably break your system

1729
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,120
So we avoid those, and design it to

1730
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,120
Work going forward anyway

1731
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,120
And Colton, you had a question

1732
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,120
Yeah

1733
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,120
So, I went

1734
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,120
Ahead and I torrented your ISO and I

1735
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,120
Loaded it up in a virtual box just now

1736
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,120
And

1737
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,120
I'd just like to say that I

1738
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,120
Really like your desktop environment

1739
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,120
And your installer's pretty nice too

1740
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,120
But, it seems a little bit

1741
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:06,120
Technical, like there's no options

1742
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,120
That allow the

1743
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,120
Installer to automatically

1744
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,120
Create a partition

1745
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,120
On the hard drive, or

1746
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,120
Like the option to install

1747
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:18,120
Grub is unchecked by default

1748
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,120
So, like

1749
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,120
Do you have any plans to fix that in the future?

1750
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:24,120
Oh yeah, I mean

1751
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,120
That thing, you know, it's

1752
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:28,120
Ugly, it's like an abortion of free will

1753
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:30,120
Oh no!

1754
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,120
No, it's getting replaced, I mean that's got a bit of

1755
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,120
History, that installer, so

1756
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:36,120
It's probably, next to

1757
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,120
Ubiquity, it's one of the oldest installers

1758
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,120
In Linux land

1759
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,120
It was originally the LMD live

1760
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,120
Installer, which I mean I used to be involved in that

1761
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,120
Once upon a time, you know

1762
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,120
We all make mistakes, no joking

1763
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,120
And then another

1764
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,120
Another thing that

1765
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,120
I noticed is when I was setting up the

1766
01:09:54,120 --> 01:09:56,120
Disks, like I, one thing

1767
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,120
Is I had to open Gparted and do everything

1768
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:00,120
Manually, which is, you know

1769
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,120
Something that most people aren't going to

1770
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,120
Want to do, and then also

1771
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,120
Like, it didn't have options

1772
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:08,120
It had an option to set up

1773
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,120
A root partition and a swap partition

1774
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,120
And that's it, no custom

1775
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,120
Home partition or anything like that

1776
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,120
Yeah, I mean I'm not proud of it

1777
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,120
And

1778
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,120
I mean it looks nice

1779
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,120
Visually it looks nice, but

1780
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,120
Just the actual content

1781
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,120
Of it is not very useful

1782
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,120
Yeah, I mean it sort of sucks

1783
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:30,120
Do you need help Ike?

1784
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,120
What is a situation like that?

1785
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,120
Do you kind of like doing it sort of

1786
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,120
With a small team, or just yourself

1787
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:38,120
Or just a few helpers? How does that work for you?

1788
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:40,120
No, I mean if people want to jump in

1789
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:42,120
By all means, jump in, you know

1790
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,120
I mean obviously it started out for myself

1791
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:46,120
I wanted, you know, I had certain needs

1792
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:48,120
That weren't being, that doesn't sound right

1793
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,120
I had certain needs for a distribution

1794
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,120
We all do Ike, we all do

1795
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:56,120
Wow

1796
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,120
But yeah, certain needs that won't be fulfilled

1797
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,120
In the distribution sense

1798
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,120
You know, so that started out for me

1799
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,120
But then other people started getting interested

1800
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,120
Probably because I actually spammed the crap out of Google Plus

1801
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,120
With screenshots, now I think about it

1802
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:10,120
Might have something to do with it

1803
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,120
Yeah, I mean we're on GitHub

1804
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,120
They can just jump in and send us a pull request

1805
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:16,120
And I will put a link to your GitHub page

1806
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:18,120
In the show notes as well

1807
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,120
So, that's cool

1808
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,120
I'm downloading the ISO right now

1809
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,120
One thing I will say is

1810
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,120
I know it's like a pig in VirtualBox

1811
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,120
Everything is

1812
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,120
I don't blame you for that

1813
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:34,120
I could make excuses for it, but

1814
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,120
I just don't think you should run it in VirtualBox

1815
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,120
Yeah, in my opinion

1816
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,120
No one should ever run anything in VirtualBox

1817
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,120
But right now I don't have a free machine

1818
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,120
That I can just load it on

1819
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:46,120
So, VirtualBox is like

1820
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,120
Oh, it's at my fingertips, so I can go ahead and do it

1821
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,120
I mean, it does make for easy testing

1822
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,120
I will say one thing

1823
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,120
It is very, very, very, very fast

1824
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:56,120
On real hardware

1825
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,120
So, you'll find

1826
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,120
I did most of my benchmarking on an Intel NUC

1827
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:02,120
Because they're awesome, obviously

1828
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,120
That's a good test rig

1829
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,120
If it runs good on a NUC, it's probably going to run good on a lot of hardware

1830
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:10,120
This is a Haswell i5

1831
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,120
To be fair, it's got 16 gigs of RAM

1832
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,120
It's not a slouch

1833
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:16,120
But it boots in 2.134 seconds

1834
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,120
2.314 seconds

1835
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,120
It's really freaking fast, basically

1836
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:22,120
Aiki, thank you for coming on here

1837
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,120
And chatting to us about a distro

1838
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,120
That we haven't got a chance to look at a lot

1839
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,120
And you're always welcome to join us

1840
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,120
We have an open Mumba room

1841
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,120
So, join us for any show

1842
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,120
And give us an update on what you're working on

1843
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,120
Or chat on stuff

1844
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,120
I also would love to see other distro makers

1845
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,120
That want to stop by and tell us what they love

1846
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,120
About the distribution they're making

1847
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:44,120
Because, take Aiki, nobody knows it like he does

1848
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:46,120
He's passionate about it because he's making it

1849
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,120
He's working on it, and it's cool to hear it from him

1850
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,120
And so, if you're out there working on something

1851
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,120
You're always welcome to join us, we just have to check your microphone

1852
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:54,120
Make sure you're going to pass the sniff test

1853
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,120
You know what, the sniff test, Matt

1854
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,120
That's what I call it

1855
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:00,120
I don't know why I call it that, because it's a sound check

1856
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:02,120
It's nothing about smell at all

1857
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,120
It sounds cool

1858
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,120
Hey Matt, is there anywhere you want to send folks throughout the week?

1859
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,120
As always, I've got stuff going on

1860
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:10,120
With articles and whatnot

1861
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,120
I always have new projects around the bend

1862
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,120
Just as it sounds

1863
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,120
Otherwise, if you forget the URL, you type in my name

1864
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,120
And I'm number one at the top

1865
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:20,120
That's magic, that's magic

1866
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,120
Hey, join us live on a Tuesday too

1867
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,120
You can chat with Matt, you can do that too, you can chat with me

1868
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,120
You can do it over at jbliv.com

1869
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,120
Alright everybody, thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

1870
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,120
Of the Unplugged program

1871
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:42,120
And we'll see you right back here next week. Cheers!

1872
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,120
Oh, we've got to do it all over again

1873
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,120
Twomp in the chat room

1874
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,120
Twomp in the chat room, fell asleep

1875
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,120
So he missed the whole show, we've got to do it all over again

1876
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,120
You know, next time, I'm just going to record the thing

1877
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,120
And then that way he can just catch it on download

1878
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:14,120
That would be way smarter

1879
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,120
Why didn't I think of that one, Matt?

1880
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,120
Well, if we're sniffing voices, we might as well have something to wake people up

1881
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,120
Maybe I was sniffing too much glue

1882
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:22,120
Alright, let's go pick our title

1883
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,120
JBtitles.com, last chance to bang

1884
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,120
And suggest the title

1885
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,120
And all of that goodness

1886
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,120
Alright, thanks for showing up today, guys

1887
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,120
Good show, appreciate having Roboto here

1888
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,120
And thanks Wimpy for showing us all up with your audio quality

1889
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:36,120
That was good too

1890
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,120
You're welcome

1891
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,120
It's just amazing

1892
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,120
Evolve your OS isn't bad, that's not a bad title

1893
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,120
That's pretty good

1894
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:46,120
Yeah, I like that

1895
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,120
Linux Evolved OS

1896
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:50,120
For Evolve OS, I think we should go for something subtle

1897
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,120
You know, like just so

1898
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,120
People don't feel that it's been rammed down their throat

1899
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,120
Like, world dominating

1900
01:14:56,120 --> 01:14:58,120
OS should be in your front room

1901
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,120
Go buy it now or we'll kill you

1902
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,120
Something subtle

1903
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:04,120
Yeah, something really subtle, I like that

1904
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,120
How about Evolve OS?

1905
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,120
It's better than the others

1906
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:10,120
Well actually

1907
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,120
We got into the whole social media thing the other day

1908
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:14,120
Because basically, I'm an absolute attention whore

1909
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:16,120
I gotta be blunt

1910
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,120
We put up a tweet

1911
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,120
Just to make everyone feel comfortable

1912
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:22,120
Everyone was like

1913
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,120
What was this one of the first tweets?

1914
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:26,120
So yeah, I haven't

1915
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,120
We haven't suddenly decided to start competing

1916
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,120
With all the other desktops right now

1917
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,120
Oh wait, yeah we have

1918
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,120
So they kind of know

1919
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,120
You're in it to win it

1920
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,120
Evolve your OS is coming up at number one

1921
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,120
Right now, that's not bad

1922
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,120
The Kickstarter withdrawal method at number two

1923
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,120
Systemd trolls Linux at number three

1924
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,120
I think Evolve your OS is a pretty good one

1925
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,120
I think it's pretty good, that's where I'd go

1926
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,120
Yeah

1927
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:52,120
I feel kind of bad because we co-opted the show

1928
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:54,120
No it's okay

1929
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,120
It was actually kind of fit

1930
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,120
We wanted to get attention

1931
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,120
That's the whole point

1932
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:02,120
That's what I love about the show actually

1933
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:04,120
We have the mumble room

1934
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,120
It's totally unexpected

1935
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,120
We had stuff to talk about

1936
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,120
I love having a show where we can just go with it

1937
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,120
It works out better that way I think

1938
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,120
Definitely

1939
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:16,120
I think honestly

1940
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:18,120
If you had a lug

1941
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,120
We'd get pretty close

1942
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:22,120
And every now and then somebody brought a friend to the meetup

1943
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,120
This is what would happen

1944
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,120
Very true

1945
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,120
Aiki you're my friend

1946
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,120
Yeah you brought a friend to the lug meetup

1947
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,120
It's pretty cool

1948
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,120
That's too official isn't it

1949
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,120
Can we go for acquaintance?

1950
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:38,120
This is too close and comfortable

1951
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:40,120
Lover, whatever it is, I don't care

1952
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:42,120
Bring them

1953
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:44,120
We're past that

1954
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,120
This isn't being recorded anymore is it?

1955
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,120
No of course not
