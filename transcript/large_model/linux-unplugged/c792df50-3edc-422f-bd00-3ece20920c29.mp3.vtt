WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.160
We have we have something kind of unusual for the unplugged show we have a

00:04.800 --> 00:10.640
Well a real lug member. I guess not a virtual lug member Anthony is right here in the trailer with me. Hey Anthony

00:10.640 --> 00:17.380
Hey, how y'all doing? I love your this so let me paint the picture for you guys Anthony is rocking a last jacket

00:17.380 --> 00:22.740
It's a little warm, too. You're rocking a last jacket and then underneath it Linux fest Northwest 2015

00:23.080 --> 00:29.200
That's how'd you get that jacket that shirt picked it up back in the spring mm-hmm when you were at?

00:29.200 --> 00:31.200
Linux best North there you go

00:32.640 --> 00:36.600
So did you make the drive did you drive all the way from here cuz I could now tell you officially

00:36.600 --> 00:41.080
That's a long-ass drive. Oh, yeah to me. I don't know it's I go to Seattle a lot

00:41.080 --> 00:45.400
So it's like to me is I guess that's nine hours, right? It's nine hours. Not too bad. Okay in ten hours

00:45.680 --> 00:50.240
Yeah, nine ten hours. Not too bad. All right. Do you do it all in one drive? Oh, yeah, okay?

00:50.400 --> 00:55.000
So you're crazy then I do you do it in your car. Yeah, all right you podcast the whole way

00:55.000 --> 00:59.680
Yeah, now you do something right? I am a vlogger. Yeah, yeah, YouTube vlogger, so tell me about that

00:59.680 --> 01:06.440
Um I vlog my life and my experiences with the Linux and computers. Are you oh really Linux isn't it mm-hmm?

01:06.440 --> 01:09.600
Are you gonna vlog this you know what I'm gonna have to yeah

01:11.040 --> 01:13.040
You got a camera over there, huh?

01:13.040 --> 01:16.880
Yep, yep. Oh boy. Oh boy. Okay. You guys. I don't I don't know if I

01:17.740 --> 01:21.940
Okay, now he's pulling out the camera right now. I'm painting a picture for you. Oh now. It's on me now

01:21.940 --> 01:26.040
How did this have this supposed to be an audio show turn the tables on Chris last I love it

01:27.280 --> 01:31.800
Now he's on video. Yeah now mom video right there. Hello everybody. Hey, it's a 4k camera here

01:31.800 --> 01:38.360
Here's the JB rover in 4k everybody is that 4k. Yeah, wow I guess if you're doing YouTube right you should do 4k

01:38.400 --> 01:45.120
Yeah, I just recently got into 4 take 4k. Yeah, how much was that? That's nice about 600 bucks. Oh, she's bad alright alright

01:45.680 --> 01:50.280
No, I want another toy now. Yeah, I bet you know that you know there

01:50.280 --> 01:52.720
Are there are a few things that come out a lot of times?

01:52.720 --> 01:56.160
I think it's just marketing like when it comes to 4g or something like that

01:56.160 --> 02:00.000
I'm like ah just a new way of marketing the same old thing, but when it comes to 4k

02:00.040 --> 02:03.920
There are very clear defined advantages that nobody can deny

02:05.280 --> 02:10.440
That make it really really really compelling to spend some money on something like a 4k camera, right?

02:10.440 --> 02:13.480
It's it's beautiful when you actually even on a 1080 display

02:13.480 --> 02:17.800
It still looks very very good right and you use it for do you do you like the super zoom effect you?

02:17.800 --> 02:23.520
But you're releasing 4k, so you're probably not doing I see. I'm getting ready to release in 4k. I just recently upgraded to this

02:24.520 --> 02:30.640
Because the new Lightworks beta is now supporting. Are you editing? Okay? Yes, I do everything on Linux

02:30.640 --> 02:35.180
Yeah, he's doing you know he's doing everything under Linux. How about that awesome brother?

02:38.120 --> 02:41.640
He's doing 4k. No you better step it up. I know I know well

02:41.640 --> 02:44.980
Here's that here's the thing if I if if it give me this alright

02:44.980 --> 02:51.320
Give me this the user interface like the layout of Lightworks is like it's horrible right like the workflow is pretty bad

02:51.320 --> 02:52.920
I don't know

02:52.920 --> 02:58.040
I actually it kind of grows on you because I've spent a lot of time in the program when I first first few months

02:58.040 --> 03:01.360
Yeah, it was the worst thing in the planet to learn and now that I'm kind of learning

03:01.360 --> 03:03.360
It's in and out somewhere everything's kind of hidden

03:03.840 --> 03:08.120
I feel like it's it's just on the power level of like premiere. What do you use for encoding?

03:08.360 --> 03:13.200
What do you what do you code out from Lightworks or using an FFmpeg once you get it out of it works?

03:13.200 --> 03:16.680
I go straight from my camera load it up into the Lightworks

03:16.680 --> 03:18.100
Yeah, and then just export it out of light

03:18.100 --> 03:22.800
I'm just export it out and Lightworks handles all the encoding all that news and throw it right up on YouTube. Yep nice

03:22.800 --> 03:28.480
That's not bad. All right. All right. I got to give that a shot the the thing about like so you've used premiere

03:28.480 --> 03:31.120
So then you'll know what I'm talking about. I feel like every other

03:31.960 --> 03:37.440
Audio product or a video production suite like I can even if I've never used it before if you just

03:37.680 --> 03:40.240
Screw around with it a little bit. You can figure it out man

03:40.240 --> 03:46.440
I bang my head against the desk for weeks trying to figure out Lightworks and I never did figure it out

03:46.440 --> 03:48.440
and what I ended up doing was they have a

03:49.400 --> 03:51.080
fantastic set of tutorials on

03:51.080 --> 03:55.760
YouTube and you can go through and they teach you how to do all the stuff and like you said once you kind of get

03:55.760 --> 04:01.720
Into their mindset and I almost and tell me if you agree with this. I almost treat Lightworks like an operating system

04:01.720 --> 04:07.780
It feels very immersive because it just kind of takes over the entire machine and then you do all of the stuff

04:07.780 --> 04:11.060
Inside of Lightworks itself, so you don't ever really leave the program

04:11.060 --> 04:14.500
And if it turns your editing machine into like an appliance, right?

04:15.060 --> 04:18.460
And if you do a monitor sport because your monitors are a mess

04:18.460 --> 04:22.900
You need especially if you need research on the other side other monitor or doing other things like checking Twitter's and whatnot

04:23.180 --> 04:24.220
You know, yeah

04:24.220 --> 04:24.620
Yeah

04:24.620 --> 04:29.460
But the one thing that I think that Lightworks has a leg up on pretty much every other video editor

04:29.460 --> 04:31.580
I've ever used is the fact that when you do that

04:31.780 --> 04:34.780
When you treat it like an operating system like it takes over all your monitors

04:34.780 --> 04:39.180
The like the preview screen you can make it as big or as small as you want

04:39.180 --> 04:42.060
You can place it anywhere on the quote-unquote workspace that you want

04:42.620 --> 04:43.700
and

04:43.700 --> 04:48.260
Mind you I haven't used some of the latter versions of Premiere some of the latter versions of Final Cut

04:48.260 --> 04:50.260
So perhaps these features do exist now

04:50.460 --> 04:53.420
But when I was previously when I was using them

04:53.420 --> 04:58.300
It seemed like there was like kind of a stock layout how they wanted you to to kind of do things and where the toolbars

04:58.300 --> 05:02.480
Were located and and that was kind of static. There was no real way to change that and with Lightworks

05:02.480 --> 05:07.240
Everything is dynamic. Everything can be moved to wherever you best think it should be. Oh

05:07.840 --> 05:11.800
Yeah, and did you know this shark actually eats some of the windows? I actually hate that

05:11.800 --> 05:14.840
I didn't it was funny like I actually wrote into the form and I'm like

05:14.840 --> 05:18.960
Is there a way to get rid of that shark and they go that's part of the sex appeal of Lightworks as we leave the shark

05:18.960 --> 05:23.480
There and I'm like, right, but it literally destroys the corner of my screen and I can't get rid of it

05:23.480 --> 05:25.960
And then it's like over all my windows and they're like, yeah, that's kind of the fun

05:25.960 --> 05:28.880
But you can you can drag it up and then it like sinks back down. I'm like, right?

05:28.880 --> 05:35.880
well, yeah, you can you can actually go over windows and it'll the shark will eat it Wow and then when you left-click the

05:35.880 --> 05:39.880
Shark all your all your eating windows will pop back up. So we got a lot of things going on on the screen

05:39.880 --> 05:45.160
So there is shark it almost some functionality there. Yeah, there's a function in there. Yeah, it's called shark. Okay. All right

05:45.160 --> 05:46.680
I'll give them that then

05:46.680 --> 05:52.600
Yeah, I I don't know. I just don't wish there was a way to turn it off. I can't say I'm a fan. I I

05:53.280 --> 05:57.880
I the there there are there are I just saw actually actually for anyone that's interested

05:57.880 --> 05:59.880
They're actually running a sale today. I

06:00.360 --> 06:02.960
Just got I just got an email from the University

06:04.120 --> 06:06.120
50% off Lightworks Pro

06:06.480 --> 06:10.680
for for the for the editor so you can get access to all of the

06:11.480 --> 06:15.080
Kodaks and the way that Lightworks structures or licensing is actually pretty cool

06:15.400 --> 06:21.120
You can pay a one-time fee a large fee like you would for Adobe Premiere or Final Cut and then you buy that version of

06:21.120 --> 06:23.120
Lightworks and it's yours forever

06:23.120 --> 06:28.320
And so you download it and then you install it and then you're stuck on that version now the way that I do it is

06:28.320 --> 06:34.560
I pay something like 89 bucks a year and I get the latest version as soon as it comes out

06:35.120 --> 06:42.240
For you know indefinitely, but the trade-off is I'm paying a recurring fee and at first I was a little against that actually

06:42.240 --> 06:45.360
I thought to myself. I don't like I feel like I'm just renting software

06:45.360 --> 06:49.040
I don't feel like I actually own the software and it kind of bothers me and then a buddy of mine said

06:49.040 --> 06:51.240
Let me ask you something. How much did you pay for at the time?

06:51.240 --> 06:55.360
I think it was it was Final Cut that I was using and I said it was a couple, you know

06:55.360 --> 06:59.720
High hundreds of dollars if I remember right at least back in the day. Yeah. Yeah seven

06:59.720 --> 07:03.720
I think was the last one I bought it. I want to say Chris. Does this sound right seven or eight hundred bucks?

07:03.720 --> 07:09.040
Hey, well, if you bought it at its peak Final Cut seven might have even been you got the full Final Cut suite

07:09.040 --> 07:13.840
It could have been twelve hundred dollars. Yeah. Yeah, it was it was it was it was Final Cut and then it was motion

07:13.840 --> 07:18.320
And then that's the twelve hundred dollar one. Yeah. Yeah, I think I got a bit of a discount cuz I remember

07:18.320 --> 07:21.440
I think it was under a gram, but I remember being a significant amount of money and

07:21.680 --> 07:25.160
When I and then then I was talking to him about and he goes how long did you use it?

07:25.160 --> 07:27.080
I said, oh, you know three four years and he goes great

07:27.080 --> 07:31.200
So it'd be half the cost man to just pay the 89 bucks a year

07:31.200 --> 07:34.720
And if you you're never gonna keep the software for ten years, and I thought about it

07:34.720 --> 07:39.000
I'm like, yeah, he's right. When would I use one version of software for ten years? I would that would never happen

07:39.880 --> 07:46.400
That's true. Yeah, and you know so for some reason though that same logic doesn't come for me about Adobe Creative Cloud because we have

07:46.400 --> 07:50.720
Adobe Creative Cloud because we have JB has a subscription to Creative Cloud for a couple of machines

07:50.720 --> 07:53.740
none of the machines that I use well not frequently but

07:54.880 --> 07:59.820
The it that burns me that for some reason paying for Creative Cloud burns me. I don't know why

08:00.440 --> 08:05.760
If maybe maybe it's because it's it probably mainly actually I actually probably would have zero issue

08:06.160 --> 08:09.600
Paying for it if they made Creative Cloud work on Linux then I yeah

08:09.720 --> 08:14.160
Yeah, then I could do it and maybe if it was a little less irritating with constantly reminding you

08:14.160 --> 08:21.080
Yeah, thank you. Yes that too. I think as free software people I think is open-source people

08:21.080 --> 08:25.760
I think as Linux people I think that I think what it is is I think we have it ingrained in our head

08:26.080 --> 08:33.200
That subscription leans leads to us getting burned because I have been burned so many times by a company who?

08:33.480 --> 08:39.480
Existed and then the company goes away and so I can't renew my subscription or reactivate the software and let's take for example

08:39.480 --> 08:42.940
Lightworks, let's just say here's here's what is a very realistic prospect

08:42.940 --> 08:44.260
Seven years from now

08:44.260 --> 08:49.540
Maybe edit share goes out of business and then my subscription thing goes down the tubes because I never bought it outright and so I

08:49.540 --> 08:53.100
No longer have access to Lightworks. All I can do is start it up and I get to a login screen

08:53.100 --> 08:59.340
I have all of my projects for the past ten years that right now I can open them back up and make any edits

08:59.340 --> 09:01.340
I want change anything. I want

09:01.340 --> 09:08.060
Re export them if if tomorrow a different Kodak comes out and everyone wants it in a different format and now Lightworks supports that I

09:08.060 --> 09:14.780
Could open that project file up with my raw video and export back out into this new format. I could do all of that

09:15.780 --> 09:22.540
Until I no longer have access to the software and then all of that that the all those options go away and essentially I have

09:22.540 --> 09:26.580
been archiving all those project files for years for nothing and I think that as

09:27.340 --> 09:29.980
As people that have been burned by that in the past

09:29.980 --> 09:34.020
I think that people like you and I Chris I think we're and West I think that we are aware of that

09:34.020 --> 09:37.540
And I think that I and I think that so then when it comes down to it

09:37.540 --> 09:39.220
Even if we can't always put our finger on it

09:39.220 --> 09:44.580
And even if it doesn't make sense on paper paying twelve hundred dollars as a one-time fee versus 89 bucks a year

09:44.580 --> 09:49.260
I think it just makes it in our in our ethos and in and deep inside of us

09:49.260 --> 09:54.820
I think we know that there is an inherent danger. There's inherent risk associated with that and so we shy away from it

09:54.820 --> 09:58.340
I think anytime you've been around even for a few years

09:58.340 --> 10:04.700
You realize that a lot of times commercial companies are more dictated by the whims of the market

10:04.700 --> 10:09.740
Then they will try to present even companies like Adobe and other really big companies

10:09.820 --> 10:14.700
They are very much driven by the next new shiny the next new thing that's going to generate profit and they're not

10:14.860 --> 10:19.620
You know that doesn't and I'm not I'm not making a comment if that's bad or good because in some ways

10:19.620 --> 10:20.860
That's what pushes things forward

10:20.860 --> 10:26.940
But in another way it it also means abandoning previous ways of doing things and one of the things

10:26.940 --> 10:28.840
I this is just me being you know

10:28.840 --> 10:31.180
Maybe I've been looking at the hills of Montana for too long

10:31.180 --> 10:37.500
but I really kind of look back at some of the stuff that we create in these proprietary formats these proprietary containers and

10:38.140 --> 10:42.620
And I think this is stuff that is gonna be generationally lost

10:42.620 --> 10:45.460
It's a generation is generational problem

10:45.460 --> 10:51.260
It is an entire generation of people that are going to lose access to the content that they have created be it

10:51.500 --> 10:53.540
Videos or photos or music?

10:53.540 --> 10:57.140
I mean anything that's stored in a garage band file anything that's stored in a logic file

10:57.140 --> 11:02.460
That's probably not gonna open in a hundred years and maybe maybe your crappy music doesn't need to open up in a hundred years

11:02.460 --> 11:09.280
But wouldn't it be neat if a hundred years from now a family member or a historian or somebody could access a perfect digital

11:09.660 --> 11:15.740
pristine copy of what you created a hundred years ago and be able to listen to it or watch it and the only thing preventing

11:15.740 --> 11:22.040
Them from be able to do that is some proprietary codec or some a proprietary format or some lockdown application

11:22.040 --> 11:24.740
And when you think about in that context, it's it's a real shame

11:24.740 --> 11:27.220
It's a real shame actually if you think about it, too

11:27.580 --> 11:32.100
Let you look at like when when my when my grandfather passed away him and I were very close

11:32.100 --> 11:35.900
And so I was I was really interested in learning about his life before

11:36.540 --> 11:41.020
Before me before I knew him as grandpa. I wanted to know, you know what the rest of his life was like and

11:41.980 --> 11:47.620
We found pictures and documents and all this stuff that he had from back when he was in the military when he was 18 19

11:47.620 --> 11:50.940
Years old and I found that I found that two days before he graduated high school

11:50.940 --> 11:54.780
Was what I found his enlistment application and it was dated two days before

11:55.620 --> 12:00.780
He he graduated high school and it was just interesting to look and see that was you know

12:00.780 --> 12:02.540
That was him as he was an Air Force guy

12:02.540 --> 12:07.740
I'm like, wow, I can't imagine like before I even get out of high school saying this is what I'm gonna commit the next

12:07.740 --> 12:09.820
You know for sure at least eight years of my life

12:09.820 --> 12:14.900
but then 30 years and the only reason I was able to go back and have that connection with him was because I found these

12:14.900 --> 12:17.380
documents and I found the pictures and stuff like that and

12:17.380 --> 12:25.820
Like you're talking about in in in 50 my grandkids. I don't have I haven't taken pictures of my kids that we print out

12:25.820 --> 12:30.100
They're on Facebook and they're on Twitter. There's I have tons of them on a hard drive as I do video, right?

12:30.100 --> 12:35.520
Yeah, who knows what is JPEG gonna open in a hundred years? I don't know. I mean, I hope so. I think so

12:35.940 --> 12:41.460
So yeah, I think that I so I I think that there is I think there's a real concern of that

12:41.460 --> 12:43.460
I think we have to be careful

12:43.460 --> 12:49.540
This is Linux unplugged episode 111 for September 22nd 2015

13:01.160 --> 13:03.640
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly tech

13:04.140 --> 13:06.820
Talk show that's being brought to you from well

13:07.340 --> 13:12.140
It kind of depends upon the hour and the current geographical location of JB rover

13:12.140 --> 13:14.340
My name is Noah and joining me is

13:15.180 --> 13:16.260
Wes

13:16.260 --> 13:18.660
Hey, it's Wes guys. Wes is

13:19.500 --> 13:21.140
joining me in

13:21.140 --> 13:26.300
Seattle in the studio and then I'm actually in Grand Forks hosting the show and then Chris

13:26.740 --> 13:31.900
The hair master Chris is actually in JB rover right now in the middle of Montana

13:32.540 --> 13:35.500
Hello guys. Hi, how is Montana?

13:36.080 --> 13:39.660
Well, I found a spot that has connectivity and it's actually quite pleasant here

13:39.660 --> 13:43.340
And it's it there's time differences and all these kinds of things. It's a lot of fun

13:43.340 --> 13:49.220
I get to struggle with time math. I get to find cellular connectivity and I get to be part of the virtual log

13:49.220 --> 13:54.780
I'm pretty excited. That sounds amazing. And I heard that you found a I first heard that you found a straggler

13:55.420 --> 13:56.860
That's right

13:56.860 --> 14:01.860
Actually to be totally correct. He found me. Hey Anthony. Hey, what's going on? Not much

14:01.860 --> 14:05.580
so Anthony I was tracking us over Jupiter broadcasting comm slash rover and

14:05.580 --> 14:09.980
He saw us parked here. We're in a gravel lot. We were driving around literally Noah

14:09.980 --> 14:15.500
We were driving around trying to find the best signal possible. We found like stop the vehicle stop the vehicle

14:15.500 --> 14:16.820
We pulled over right here

14:16.820 --> 14:20.540
Anthony was watching us in real time on the rover because he knew we were getting the best chicken in town

14:20.540 --> 14:22.140
Oh, yeah, and then

14:22.140 --> 14:25.540
That he when we got parked I started set up he came knocking on the door

14:25.540 --> 14:25.740
No

14:25.740 --> 14:30.420
I swear I started to almost panic because I thought it was the cops telling me to get the heck out of here

14:30.420 --> 14:36.900
Well, you had you had that particular spot you would stopped because of a very specific technical reason, right?

14:36.900 --> 14:39.300
It wasn't just like you were like, wow, this seems like a good place to park

14:39.980 --> 14:45.380
That's true. Well, I had to get good signal. I had to have good connection. I had that. Hello music. Hi there

14:45.380 --> 14:47.820
Go go go go. Yeah

14:47.820 --> 14:50.660
I wanted to make sure that we were able to get a good spot solid spot

14:50.660 --> 14:55.620
so that way we could get the prep the show prep necessary done and like there was like

14:55.620 --> 15:01.740
Different sections of the city that would have no cellular coverage at all. Like that's a thing around here. Oh, yeah

15:01.740 --> 15:05.340
Oh, yeah, it's just part of the challenge is part of the fun. Yeah, wait life is up here

15:05.340 --> 15:07.180
You know you go one block you have no signal, right?

15:07.180 --> 15:12.980
So we found this spot here we set up and now the only downside is we don't have any shore power here

15:12.980 --> 15:16.440
So everything we're doing right now is completely running off of DC battery

15:16.460 --> 15:21.860
So hopefully we'll last we got we got the my five plugged in to the DC outlet

15:21.860 --> 15:26.140
We're running both laptops off of battery power and the mixer itself is as you know

15:26.140 --> 15:28.580
Noah is able to run off of 9-volt batteries

15:28.580 --> 15:32.700
So we're running the mixer off of batteries right now, too. Oh good. You had to change them though. I heard

15:33.620 --> 15:35.620
Just when we were about to start the show

15:35.820 --> 15:42.780
Literally right like everything's all dialed in Noah and it's like all these different challenges because I didn't I didn't quite plan to have two

15:42.780 --> 15:48.540
People in the rover, but Anthony was totally prepared brought his own microphone. It's a gold mic too. Yeah. Yeah, it's a gold mic

15:48.540 --> 15:52.620
That's awesome. But we didn't so we got everything wired and I'm like look at us

15:52.660 --> 15:57.100
We managed to get two people set up right on and then all of a sudden no audio

15:57.380 --> 15:59.540
Zoom and we're like what what's going on?

15:59.540 --> 16:03.180
What is but it was it was enough power to still show power light on the mixer

16:03.180 --> 16:06.140
But not enough power to send phantom power to the microphones

16:06.140 --> 16:09.580
So the mics themselves were dead, but the mixer had enough power

16:09.580 --> 16:12.700
So thankfully you included a nice box of 9-volt battery

16:12.700 --> 16:16.740
So I just plugged another three in and we're good to go. Oh good the you know

16:16.740 --> 16:20.500
It's funny is when I bought that mixer the guy specifically told me he's like it will run forever

16:21.060 --> 16:25.700
without a battery change and being as you've been on the road for going on 72 hours and

16:26.100 --> 16:31.660
You've done attempted one show and this is the first one. We're going all the way through. I'm gonna guess that's not the case

16:32.180 --> 16:35.780
Unless you left it on the whole time. No, I did not leave it on. I didn't think so

16:35.820 --> 16:39.780
Do you have to think though? It's if you think about it, so there are three nine volt batteries that are in there, right?

16:40.780 --> 16:43.860
So yes three nine volts. So math tells us that's nine eighteen

16:43.860 --> 16:46.140
Nineteen twenty four. Is that right?

16:47.180 --> 16:49.180
Yes. Okay, so

16:49.300 --> 16:52.780
48 volts is what's required for the phantom power

16:52.780 --> 16:59.140
And so I guess that would kind of make sense that they would essentially what they're doing is they're getting half of the voltage and then

16:59.140 --> 17:01.620
Probably doubling it to power the phantom power

17:01.660 --> 17:07.280
But that's a lot that's twice the amount of voltage draw on on on each of those batteries

17:07.280 --> 17:13.060
So it would make some I guess that 27. Yeah. Yeah, Matt and now we're also we're powering two microphones now

17:13.060 --> 17:16.340
Yeah, well there are do you have dynamic mics or condenser mics?

17:17.060 --> 17:21.780
There there one. What is your mic? I have the re20. What's yours? Yeah, it's a condenser mic

17:21.780 --> 17:25.740
Yeah, it is condensers. You know what? I don't know. It was a cheap one on Amazon. I did it for game

17:25.740 --> 17:29.320
I use phantom for the re20 because it powers the amp is powered by phantom

17:30.100 --> 17:31.580
Huh?

17:31.580 --> 17:33.580
So anyways, but you know

17:33.900 --> 17:41.940
The the thing that's actually a little more interesting about about the rover is I'm actually I'm finding some challenges some challenges with DC

17:41.940 --> 17:45.900
Power that I didn't expect so I'm not I'm hitting some speed bumps there

17:45.900 --> 17:51.840
But other than that, we're all good and you have you have your you brought the the XPS 13 with you, right?

17:52.740 --> 17:54.740
Yes, sir. Now, is that running enter goes?

17:55.660 --> 18:01.340
Yes, sir. All right. So I saw that we are talking about enter goes today and

18:01.900 --> 18:04.700
That is we are going to talk about supporting enter goes now

18:04.700 --> 18:06.820
Here's the thing the first time I ever did arch

18:06.820 --> 18:12.460
When you got when back when you and Matt actually did the Linux action show and talked about how we should switch to arch

18:12.460 --> 18:13.960
I was game. I thought I'll give it a shot

18:13.960 --> 18:16.740
I don't really think I'm gonna stick with it, but we'll see what it's like now

18:16.740 --> 18:21.860
I'm too lazy to read the wiki which is what everyone which is what a good arch user should do and in fact

18:21.860 --> 18:24.220
Oh, yeah, exactly. You can see where this is going, right?

18:24.460 --> 18:29.460
So what I did was I did what I call the way of the future

18:29.460 --> 18:33.140
Which is when your dishwasher breaks, you don't break out the manual anymore when your refrigerator breaks

18:33.140 --> 18:37.660
You don't break out the manual. What do you do? You go to YouTube and type in the problem and see if somebody walks you

18:37.660 --> 18:38.380
Through so that's what I did

18:38.380 --> 18:39.060
By the way

18:39.060 --> 18:42.560
That's also what you do when you can't remember if you put the sway bars on your hitch

18:42.620 --> 18:44.620
When it's up a little bit or down all the way

18:45.060 --> 18:49.660
It up if I remember right? Yeah, it works much better. You can get it. You can get a few more links in the chain

18:50.500 --> 18:54.400
So I went to YouTube and I looked how to install arch and there was this guy

18:54.400 --> 18:57.700
He pronounced a bunch of words wrong despite making claims that he was pronouncing them

18:57.700 --> 19:02.620
Correct, and then and then went through it and and and went through the installation at March

19:02.620 --> 19:04.740
And after I got done, I was like I could do that

19:04.740 --> 19:06.100
It'll take me about an hour

19:06.100 --> 19:11.300
but I could do that so I grab a spare computer and I installed arch and when I got done I was happy I

19:11.300 --> 19:15.540
Was most I was 90% happy with the experience and I was 90% happy with the result

19:15.540 --> 19:19.900
But my problem was I was afraid to go back and change anything

19:19.900 --> 19:24.700
I was afraid to blow it away and do it all over again because there was no way I was gonna be able to reload

19:24.700 --> 19:29.980
My laptop, you know in the 20 minutes that I've become accustomed to and so anytime I would travel

19:29.980 --> 19:33.020
I would never take my laptop with me because I thought if anything ever happens

19:33.020 --> 19:38.540
I have to have an internet connection and I have to have like an hour of time and not to mention my guide

19:38.700 --> 19:42.060
Which I was keeping on an Evernote so I'd have it on my on my phone

19:42.060 --> 19:44.260
So I'd have all the steps written down because I remember them

19:44.260 --> 19:49.540
So it was just kind of problematic and I thought so it's a great operating system and I really like arch

19:49.540 --> 19:53.800
But I don't think I could ever seriously commit to it because of some of those problems and answer goes

19:54.360 --> 19:58.100
completely solve that for me and it did that in that I

19:58.100 --> 20:04.060
Could now treat the Linux installation the at the arch Linux installation

20:04.060 --> 20:05.620
I could have an arch Linux installation

20:05.620 --> 20:11.500
but I could treat it just like every other distro in that I had a USB installer and I stuck it in and I just

20:11.500 --> 20:16.420
clicked next and I waited for the bar to go from left to right made a couple couple of choices along the way and

20:16.580 --> 20:21.220
I had a working Linux distro. Yeah, it's not even I mean you could stop right there

20:21.220 --> 20:25.900
I mean, it's not even the fact that it's arch right this fact that it's just a nice setup usable distro with a good-looking theme

20:25.900 --> 20:30.180
by default and you know, one of the things they're doing now to make arch more approachable is

20:30.520 --> 20:38.020
They are giving you options at installation to do things like enable the long-term support kernel instead of the instead of the kernel gets updated

20:38.020 --> 20:41.980
All the time use the LTS kernel. Do you want to have Samba work out of the box? Check a box

20:41.980 --> 20:49.580
You want an arch user repository tool check a box you want Samba printer support check a box what LibreOffice check a box and all

20:49.580 --> 20:56.260
Yeah, or simple a simple firewall check a box, right and these things all are just one check now

20:56.260 --> 20:57.540
And they make for a very good distro

20:57.540 --> 20:59.820
It doesn't matter if it's arch fedora or Ubuntu

20:59.820 --> 21:04.180
You'd want that on anything and the fact that antergos is making this as part of their installation

21:04.180 --> 21:07.660
It in my opinion takes and it takes arch not just approachable

21:07.660 --> 21:10.780
But when you start talking LTS kernels and things like that

21:10.780 --> 21:14.660
I think it opens up to a whole other realm of use cases and the fact that they're just building that right in there is

21:14.660 --> 21:16.580
smart smart smart

21:16.580 --> 21:21.220
So and well, I'm gonna get your take and I definitely want to get West's take on this too

21:21.220 --> 21:23.940
But a lot of times I feel like when I'm trying a Linux distro out

21:24.060 --> 21:26.980
Essentially what I'm really doing is evaluating the desktop

21:27.580 --> 21:31.780
Having used fedora for so long and so having used gnome 3 for so long

21:32.340 --> 21:36.020
it's not uncommon for me to sit down at my arch box and type yum and

21:36.500 --> 21:39.900
Because of that and that's just because I'm so used to when I see gnome

21:39.900 --> 21:42.700
I just have fedora pictured that's running in the background

21:42.700 --> 21:48.540
And the reality is thus the differences between arch and fedora at least from a usability standpoint once it's set up

21:49.660 --> 21:56.100
It's not much right if I'm primarily interacting with gnome now where antergo sets itself apart

21:56.100 --> 22:02.180
And why I think it's it's a it's a really solid good operating system. In fact in some ways a lot better than fedora is

22:03.020 --> 22:05.420
Well, really it begins and ends with the AUR

22:05.420 --> 22:09.740
Right when I want to try software if I want to try a new piece of software

22:09.740 --> 22:12.700
Especially if we're testing something for the show, I don't grab the Ubuntu box

22:12.700 --> 22:14.380
I certainly don't sit down in my fedora box

22:14.380 --> 22:21.500
I grab my arch laptop and or my antergos laptop and that's because with a single command I can go out and grab

22:21.860 --> 22:28.420
How however the package is packaged whether it's available with source code or whether it's available in a deb or available in RPM

22:28.660 --> 22:34.780
somebody has taken that and putting that into the arch AUR and then I can pull that down onto my laptop and

22:34.780 --> 22:41.980
To me that is such a huge time-saver that feature alone almost trumps everything else

22:42.260 --> 22:45.680
Every other advantage that every other distro could offer it is nice

22:45.780 --> 22:49.340
It's nice to be able to just like install software on the fly while I'm on air

22:49.340 --> 22:52.860
Like a lot of times when you and I are talking about an app on the show

22:52.860 --> 22:55.040
If it's not if you if you convinced me to try it

22:55.040 --> 22:59.580
I'll just install it right there on the show and try it. So I know Wes

22:59.580 --> 23:02.840
I'm gonna jump to you for a second. But Anthony, what are you using for Linux? What's your main distro?

23:02.840 --> 23:07.220
My main distro is arch. Oh really and Wes your main distros arch too, right?

23:07.220 --> 23:13.220
Sure is has been for three years or so. Jeez. Listen to us. Oh my gosh. Well, it's funny. It's later in the show today

23:13.220 --> 23:17.700
I might confess my love for fedora. I don't know. You know, there's a couple of things

23:17.700 --> 23:24.340
I note where I'm offline and having to update a rolling distro on over a cellular connection is getting old

23:24.860 --> 23:28.960
Super fast, so I don't know. I don't want to say we're all a bunch of arch bitch bigots

23:28.960 --> 23:32.640
But it is now no and to be fair though. No, it's not your daily driver, right?

23:33.400 --> 23:34.960
well

23:34.960 --> 23:37.280
I'm not exactly sure how to answer that because I

23:38.680 --> 23:45.960
For the purpose of not getting made fun of by all of my Jupiter broadcasting supportive teammates who constantly make fun of my fedora laptop

23:45.960 --> 23:47.840
I installed on my ThinkPad

23:47.840 --> 23:53.760
I have arch and so everything I do for Jupiter broadcasting all the show prep all of that stuff is being done on my ThinkPad and

23:53.760 --> 24:00.440
Then somewhere along halfway through the year. I decided it was too inconvenient to do all the speed stuff on my Dell and

24:01.120 --> 24:03.500
Jupiter broadcasting stuff on my ThinkPad

24:03.500 --> 24:08.240
but at that point all of my stuff and all of my programs and everything was kind of set up on my ThinkPad so I

24:08.240 --> 24:09.980
just kind of

24:09.980 --> 24:11.980
unintentionally, I guess switch to it full-time and

24:12.640 --> 24:13.920
so

24:13.920 --> 24:18.700
My main laptop is running arch and that is the laptop that sits in front of my face

24:18.700 --> 24:25.260
80% of the day. I have an Ubuntu box. That's that's downstairs at home, and I don't have any particular

24:25.780 --> 24:30.140
I don't have any particular native love for Ubuntu if it was my choice

24:30.140 --> 24:34.460
I'd probably be using fedora, but because Ubuntu is such a successful operating system

24:34.460 --> 24:38.580
It's the one that I point other people to and therefore it becomes it becomes

24:38.780 --> 24:41.860
Extremely important for me to know how to solve the problems on Ubuntu

24:41.860 --> 24:43.620
So I forced myself to use it

24:43.620 --> 24:45.420
So if I'm at home and I'm sitting at my desk

24:45.420 --> 24:49.620
I'm using Ubuntu and I I kind of feel like I have forced myself to do that

24:49.620 --> 24:55.280
It's not so much of a choice. I'm interested though. What got what got you started on on arch west?

24:55.980 --> 24:59.180
you know I was in a bunch of user for a long time before that and

24:59.260 --> 25:05.920
I kind of just wanted to dig in more get into I ran into a couple configuration problems after the initial unity switch

25:05.940 --> 25:10.580
obviously things are a lot more polished now, but that had me digging around in configuration files and

25:10.580 --> 25:14.860
And some forums I'd you know I heard some people using arch and they talked it up a lot

25:14.860 --> 25:19.660
And I was like well is this really that cool and so far. I've been really happy with it

25:19.660 --> 25:25.200
I think what you touched on with the AUR speaks kind of the way arch is built in general with the arch build system

25:25.200 --> 25:30.280
You know you can download the package build for any of the repo files if you want you can modify them

25:30.280 --> 25:32.380
It makes it really easy to add your own files as well

25:32.380 --> 25:35.620
If you just want to make you know turn something that you can only get in a tar GZ

25:35.620 --> 25:38.780
You can make that into a into a regular install

25:38.780 --> 25:43.960
Yeah, speaking of software that speaking of software or solutions that you can get on the fly

25:44.580 --> 25:46.580
over at reddit.com

25:46.620 --> 25:51.700
Slash our slash Linux action show people submit projects that they think we'd be interested in or software

25:51.700 --> 25:55.540
They think we might be interested in and Chris has been talking about how he's trying to move his life

25:55.860 --> 26:03.060
from being connected online to being connected to seeming like he's connected online while simultaneously being offline and

26:03.500 --> 26:08.740
One of the ways that he is going to do that or one of the things that he needs to accomplish that is he

26:08.740 --> 26:15.980
Needs to minimize the amount of traffic that he's sending and so French AP 41 was kind enough to submit when proxy

26:16.340 --> 26:18.340
to the subreddit and

26:18.360 --> 26:26.220
Essentially what went when proxy is is a free portable TCP proxy which makes TCP connections send less data which improves TCP performance

26:26.620 --> 26:30.260
and the throughput over lossy links now if you're sitting on a

26:30.820 --> 26:33.820
Mobile hotspot and I don't care who is providing the mobile hotspot

26:33.820 --> 26:38.580
Connection can be up and down particularly if you don't know within

26:39.080 --> 26:43.340
500 miles where exactly you're gonna be then things really get interesting

26:43.340 --> 26:50.380
And so the ability to limit the amount of traffic that you're sending back and forth becomes really really important

26:50.380 --> 26:53.700
I'm interested Chris. Have you set this up and have you tried it? And if so, how is it working?

26:54.860 --> 26:57.260
You know the other thing, you know, I haven't set it up yet

26:57.260 --> 27:00.260
I just saw this today because he's he's submitted it six hours ago

27:00.260 --> 27:05.340
But the other thing I thought about know is you nailed it right on the over the over the my fight connection anything you can

27:05.340 --> 27:07.340
Do to reduce traffic is killer

27:07.340 --> 27:14.020
But the thing that that struck me is it might also work really well when driving down the road just because it might help

27:14.020 --> 27:19.100
Smooth out that spotting is that you have as you're just driving down the road and there's different, you know

27:19.100 --> 27:21.100
Different you're moving between towers and things like that

27:21.540 --> 27:25.140
And I he likes he warns us to he says don't be fooled or repelled

27:25.140 --> 27:30.180
By its Spartan web page rent when proxy helps by compressing and duplicating data

27:30.820 --> 27:34.460
So it makes things magically faster when you have slow links

27:34.460 --> 27:39.080
He says that seems like that'd be super important if you're sitting in you know, you know trailer

27:39.180 --> 27:44.160
I can't think of I was trying to think as I was reading over the show notes if there was a place that I could

27:44.160 --> 27:47.280
Implement this honestly, you know Grand Forks back in 1997

27:47.280 --> 27:52.420
We had a really bad flood like a super bad flood. And in fact when you come here Chris, I will show you

27:52.420 --> 27:57.540
There's a landmark. It actually looks kind of like a giant penis but

27:58.100 --> 28:03.840
Around the shaft of the statue is a ring and that shows how high the water was back in

28:04.100 --> 28:09.360
1997 and it was it I mean people's houses were literally underwater when we got back into Grand Forks

28:09.360 --> 28:12.980
There were like cars on the roof of garages and stuff like that Wow

28:13.380 --> 28:14.460
Yeah, it was crazy

28:14.460 --> 28:19.500
But here's the good thing that came out of it when they went through to redo the streets and essentially rebuild the city

28:19.500 --> 28:26.260
Somebody somewhere had the brilliant idea of let's bury fiber everywhere in Grand Forks. I'm moving there. Yes. Yeah

28:26.260 --> 28:29.700
Yeah, so we have fiber right up almost right up to our doorstep

28:29.700 --> 28:35.160
There is a multiplexer that's out in the that is at this at the box out in the yard that and then they run copper

28:35.160 --> 28:37.160
into the house, which I think is silly but

28:37.620 --> 28:43.400
The that I have there is no place in in the city or any of the customers that I support where it would ever be

28:44.100 --> 28:47.940
Where it ever be beneficial to me to limit my TCP traffic

28:47.940 --> 28:50.700
So I can't say that this is something that I'm going to try

28:52.060 --> 28:54.220
Simply because I wouldn't know how to really evaluate it

28:54.220 --> 28:56.220
I wouldn't know if it was doing a good job or a bad job

28:56.300 --> 28:58.700
But I think it would be super important if you were in a rover

28:59.060 --> 29:04.740
the other thing that I think that is really helpful to minimize traffic is if you can get your

29:06.140 --> 29:07.980
Certain parts of

29:07.980 --> 29:14.780
Data that you want to send over the internet not coming from your hotspot and my understanding is that the rover live tracker

29:14.980 --> 29:16.940
That isn't using

29:16.940 --> 29:19.460
Your cell phone or a hotspot or anything thing like that?

29:19.460 --> 29:25.380
It's actually updating Jupiter broadcasting comm slash rover that it's updating that live on its own, right?

29:25.820 --> 29:29.380
Yeah, they it's using silver cloud and silver cloud has some

29:30.140 --> 29:32.140
fee associated with it, but

29:32.340 --> 29:37.260
In in all practical purposes, it's just using GPRS, which is like, you know old slow

29:37.740 --> 29:41.620
Lots of coverage but not at all in Montana, right? Yeah, not in all Montana

29:41.620 --> 29:43.620
Well, in fact, where was the dead spot you were noticing?

29:43.620 --> 29:48.620
I'm just when I was watching you come across the border you disappeared until st. Regis. See that's a bummer

29:48.900 --> 29:53.580
But yeah, it's but the nice thing about it is it's a self-contained unit. It has GPS in there

29:53.580 --> 29:59.540
It gets our elevation in there. It does all of that on its own and it uses its own cellular connectivity

29:59.540 --> 30:01.540
So I don't have to worry about any data usage

30:01.820 --> 30:05.620
Now the cool thing about that is if if you were better at math than I am

30:05.700 --> 30:10.780
You could actually figure out based on how far you're going from one place to the other what your speed is

30:10.780 --> 30:17.780
And then you could do some more math and you could figure out even if the even if the device isn't updating you if it

30:17.780 --> 30:22.400
Drops off the map for a little bit. You could figure out about where you are, but people can follow you all the way

30:23.260 --> 30:27.180
From Seattle all the way to Grand Forks and when you get to Grand Forks

30:27.660 --> 30:31.580
We're gonna have a meetup and we're gonna have there's gonna be a big party in Grand Forks. That's what's gonna happen

30:31.580 --> 30:35.820
Yeah, we're gonna have a meetup. We are and and the thing is some people might be thinking

30:35.820 --> 30:41.180
You know, I've gotten all sorts. You would not believe the questions. I've gotten Chris people are asking me things like

30:41.460 --> 30:46.900
You guys have electricity up there. Do you guys it's amazing. You have internet there. How do you have running?

30:46.900 --> 30:52.020
I mean like people there's a guy asked me about an outhouse like really no, we have plumbing. Come on

30:52.020 --> 30:56.460
This I mean, it's not a third world country. It's we live in the United States. I mean, it's it's a city

30:56.460 --> 31:01.260
It's just like Arlington. It just you know a little colder and a little further away and there's not much around

31:01.260 --> 31:03.860
There's some cows and it's really flat, but it's a city

31:03.860 --> 31:06.660
And so you're gonna find out exactly

31:07.580 --> 31:09.580
What a party is when?

31:09.580 --> 31:13.600
When Chris gets here to Grand Forks, I think tentatively it's scheduled for Sunday

31:13.600 --> 31:19.620
The Sunday that Chris is gonna be here which this this coming Sunday at 7 o'clock p.m. Now that time is a little bit flexible

31:19.700 --> 31:20.700
obviously

31:20.700 --> 31:22.540
I didn't talk to Chris about it

31:22.540 --> 31:26.620
Albert just asked me if if this would work and I'm like, yeah, sure when we can change it

31:26.620 --> 31:30.020
so if if there are some people because I imagine it's gonna be a

31:30.020 --> 31:35.320
Slightly smaller group than in some of the other larger cities if there's anyone out there that

31:35.820 --> 31:39.820
Wants to come to the meetup and and Sunday is a bad day or Sunday at 7 is a bad time

31:40.540 --> 31:44.920
Just get a hold of us go over to there's a form. There's no well, there's a forum thread there, too

31:44.920 --> 31:49.260
So you think you can use the contact page, but there's also the forum thread at meetup, which Albert's monitoring

31:49.420 --> 31:53.620
That's not that time should work for us and I think we're planning to do last Friday still so that she yeah

31:53.620 --> 31:56.020
Yeah time, but yeah that the other thing too

31:56.020 --> 31:59.660
By the way, I'll just mention is if there's other people along our route that want to meet up

31:59.660 --> 32:04.580
You can use that forum there Albert's watch watching that. In fact, why don't we can we pull Odyssey down here?

32:04.580 --> 32:08.260
I don't know if we can or not. But yeah, hello. Hello, mr. Westress. So

32:09.100 --> 32:10.960
Did you want to mention anything about the meetup page?

32:10.960 --> 32:15.420
I was just gonna say the meetup form you're monitoring that if people along the way want to meet up or if people need to make

32:15.540 --> 32:17.540
Modifications that's a good way to get a hold of you, right?

32:18.180 --> 32:23.300
In fact meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting. He just opened up the Grand Forks meetup page right now

32:23.380 --> 32:26.420
So if anybody is gonna be in that area and would like to meet up with us

32:26.420 --> 32:31.060
I go to meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting. We have two RSVP right now not enough

32:31.060 --> 32:34.940
Not enough mana and those that link will be in the show notes, too. So if

32:35.580 --> 32:39.400
Somehow that's not if meetup comm slash Jupiter broadcasting isn't easy enough to remember

32:40.420 --> 32:43.180
Denny Milligan shown it. So one of the things is

32:44.380 --> 32:46.380
Chris and I have been working back and forth on

32:46.860 --> 32:49.580
Getting a mobile studio and and getting this, you know

32:49.580 --> 32:56.040
The tracking thing set up and there there's all these different moving parts that make it possible for him to do shows from the road

32:56.040 --> 33:02.140
but I think that I think one of the biggest things that he was worried about definitely the biggest thing I was worried about is

33:02.220 --> 33:04.220
mobile connectivity and

33:04.300 --> 33:11.720
The if you're looking for good mobile connectivity you want to look at something like ting if you go over to last dot tinged

33:11.720 --> 33:13.460
I'm sorry is

33:13.460 --> 33:16.660
We're at Linux dot ting.com, right? That's the that's the link for this show

33:16.660 --> 33:22.380
We get Linux dot ting.com, which if you think about it is way better than last dot ting.com branding standpoint

33:22.380 --> 33:24.380
It's like the coolest URL ever

33:24.380 --> 33:30.180
But Linux dot ting.com you go over there and you can pick from a variety of devices now

33:30.180 --> 33:34.420
I have had ting actually the first week that Chris ever

33:35.180 --> 33:38.300
Announced that that ting was a supporter of the show. I was in bed

33:38.300 --> 33:40.300
It was like 3 in the morning and I was I was watching

33:40.420 --> 33:46.840
Linux action show on my laptop and he started talking about ting and as soon as I heard the ad read

33:46.840 --> 33:50.580
I'm like, oh wow that that sounds like something I should be interested in so I

33:50.580 --> 33:56.620
I get up and I go over to my desktop where I had all of my I have all my bills and I'm doing the

33:56.620 --> 34:00.700
Little calculator and my wife looks up and she goes what on God's green earth are you doing at 3 in the morning?

34:00.700 --> 34:03.420
And I'm like, I'm signing up for a new cell phone service. This is amazing

34:03.420 --> 34:06.780
And so I sign up and I get there their cheap little phone

34:06.780 --> 34:11.220
which is only like I think it was 40 40 50 bucks at the time and they still have cheaper phones like that and

34:12.140 --> 34:18.020
But a couple weeks later I had gone to a Linux convention Linux fest Northwest and we were in

34:18.020 --> 34:20.020
We were in

34:20.900 --> 34:22.500
Bellingham and

34:22.500 --> 34:27.340
Myself my regular cell phone died. And so all I was left with was my ting phone

34:27.340 --> 34:34.140
And so ting kind of saved the day that day and ever since then I then then I switched to an actual smartphone and

34:34.740 --> 34:41.260
Then I started buying more and more phones to add them onto the ting network. So I have my dad

34:41.260 --> 34:45.820
I have my mother. I've got my sister. I've got my wife. I've even got a good friend of mine

34:45.820 --> 34:51.180
That's that's all I'm on my my aunt is all of my ting account. And the reason is because it's so cost-effective

34:51.860 --> 34:53.420
it's gonna be

34:53.420 --> 34:56.180
my bill ranges from like $18 to

34:57.060 --> 35:00.900
I'd say 35 40 at the absolute at the at the absolute most

35:01.500 --> 35:07.380
Of course, I haven't looked as I've added as I keep adding people on that that number sure to climb a little bit

35:07.380 --> 35:09.180
But the nice thing is you only pay for what you use

35:09.180 --> 35:14.300
So if you're the kind of person that doesn't make any phone calls like my sister doesn't she texts and she used the Internet?

35:14.300 --> 35:17.380
But she never actually makes any calls. She's not gonna pay for minutes

35:17.740 --> 35:25.140
On the other hand if you're the kind of person that is really really really good at making at finding alternative ways to make calls

35:25.140 --> 35:27.980
So for example, I use my phone on Wi-Fi all the time

35:27.980 --> 35:34.800
So all of my calls are going over data because I'm using sip except it's that's actually being transmitted over Wi-Fi

35:34.800 --> 35:40.660
So I'm not using minutes and I'm not using data and all of my text messages are being sent over Google Hangouts

35:40.660 --> 35:43.240
So that's not using any data and ting is completely cool with that

35:43.240 --> 35:48.040
So go over to go over to linux.ting.com and pick something out

35:49.440 --> 35:55.300
You're gonna be really happy that you did Chris has I think you have you know, what you have three ting devices in your in your RV

35:56.960 --> 36:01.320
To maybe he's got a hotspot and he's got a and he's got a phone

36:01.880 --> 36:04.080
At least and probably a couple more

36:04.160 --> 36:08.600
So the first story we want to talk about and I'm really interested to see what the mumble room thinks of this

36:09.360 --> 36:11.280
we have

36:11.280 --> 36:14.520
It as as some of you know Chris is coming here to look at my automated house

36:14.520 --> 36:18.220
I have automated my house. And in fact, my automated house is actually just one on the market today

36:19.360 --> 36:22.520
but there was a story about a gentleman who

36:23.200 --> 36:30.680
Pioneered a smart home and then his smart home actually ended up with the denial of service. Oh, I love this story

36:30.680 --> 36:38.700
Yeah, have you seen this the challenge of the futurist pioneer is being patent zero for a future day headaches in 2009 Paul Rouse

36:38.700 --> 36:43.040
a computer science professor from the Free University of Berlin

36:43.900 --> 36:45.900
Built Germany's first smart home

36:46.140 --> 36:51.820
Everything in the home was connected to the internet so that the lights television heating and cooling could all be turned on and off from

36:51.820 --> 36:56.220
Afar even the stove oven and microwave could be turned off in Rojas computer

36:56.700 --> 37:02.940
Which prevented some potential panic attacks about leaving the appliances on after he exited the house. This sounds like you know

37:02.940 --> 37:06.460
This sounds like you very much. So in fact, I have such a you know me

37:06.460 --> 37:09.100
I have such an absent-minded memory that things like this

37:09.500 --> 37:14.460
become huge to me the ability to walk into my house and go did I remember to turn that on or did I remember to

37:14.460 --> 37:20.900
Turn that up and then you add to that my incessant laziness of doing repetitive tasks that I think are a waste of time

37:20.900 --> 37:22.420
So for example when I walk into a room

37:22.420 --> 37:26.780
I think the light should just come on because we have these things called motion sensors and it should know that I'm in the room

37:26.780 --> 37:27.460
And if I'm in the room

37:27.460 --> 37:32.900
I want light and I just I find the the concept that I should have to walk over to a specific area of the room

37:32.900 --> 37:38.740
And hit the wall randomly numerous times until I find some sort of tactile device that I can then

37:38.820 --> 37:42.420
Flip up to make the room illuminate and then the room illuminates at a hundred percent brightness

37:42.420 --> 37:46.460
Which I think is total overkill it just it just seems antiquated and ridiculous to me

37:46.460 --> 37:47.780
So yes, this is very me

37:47.780 --> 37:51.140
But one of the last things that were connected to his house were the locks now

37:51.140 --> 37:56.980
I do have my locks automated automated locks Rojas bought in 2009. We're still sitting in a drawer waiting to be installed

37:56.980 --> 38:00.420
I was afraid of not being able to open the doors Rojas said in a phone interview

38:00.420 --> 38:06.460
Now about two years ago Rojas Rojas house froze up and stopped responding to his commands. Nothing worked

38:06.460 --> 38:08.780
I couldn't turn the lights on or off it got stuck

38:08.820 --> 38:15.260
He says it was like a beach ball of death begins spinning on my computer, except it was my entire home

38:15.260 --> 38:19.700
Now this is my wife's worst nightmare right now. So she's listening. I'm gonna get killed when I get home

38:20.340 --> 38:22.340
Because this is what she's worried about

38:23.900 --> 38:29.580
It wasn't quite it wasn't quite as bad as a nightmare on the connected home Street dream dreamt up by wired last year

38:29.580 --> 38:31.580
But it was a fictional smart home's obsolete

38:31.620 --> 38:36.320
Technology gets loaded with viruses and malware and starts misbehaving and uploading naked photos of its owner

38:36.660 --> 38:42.300
Rojas a professor who specializes in artificial intelligence knows his way around the network well enough to cure his own home

38:42.300 --> 38:46.580
And when he investigated it turned out that the culprit was a single connected light bulb

38:46.580 --> 38:53.160
I connected my laptop to the network and looked at the traffic and saw that one unit was sending packets continuously said Rojas

38:54.100 --> 38:58.980
He realized that the light fixture had been burnt out and was trying to tell the hub that it needed its attention

38:58.980 --> 39:04.540
To do so it started sending continuous requests that had overloaded the networking and caused it to freeze

39:04.620 --> 39:07.300
It was a continual denial of service attack. He says

39:08.060 --> 39:09.760
the light was performing a

39:09.760 --> 39:16.700
DDoS attack or a dos attack on my smart home to say change me Rojas change the light bulb and the problem was fixed

39:16.980 --> 39:19.740
So a couple things come to mind first of all

39:19.740 --> 39:23.860
I think that when people automate their house their houses

39:23.860 --> 39:30.420
You have to be first of all aware that you are taking technology and you are putting fundamental

39:31.380 --> 39:33.380
aspects of your life on

39:33.580 --> 39:39.460
The line and so when you your ability to get up and shower in the morning your ability to turn

39:41.260 --> 39:46.880
To turn on to turn at the television to watch things all of that

39:47.620 --> 39:51.020
Is it becomes reliant on your computer system?

39:51.020 --> 39:56.260
And if there's anything we know about computer systems working on computer systems, is that can we can we just stop right here?

39:56.260 --> 39:58.260
Because this is exactly

39:58.780 --> 40:05.700
Exactly my big hesitation even as a fan of technology and and and as somebody who wants to implement some of these things

40:05.700 --> 40:10.660
I start to think to myself, you know, like for example, I mean I hate to be this guy right now

40:10.660 --> 40:13.820
But here in in the JB rover, you know what I like

40:13.820 --> 40:18.260
I like that every single light has its own individual power switch

40:18.260 --> 40:23.100
I like that my water in my shower has a manual cutoff switch that I can hit

40:23.100 --> 40:28.940
I like that every single thing has its own individual control point and they're all manually operated

40:28.940 --> 40:33.260
You know what else I like for some reason I can't tell you why but for some reason I like the ability to turn

40:33.260 --> 40:36.780
My water heater on and off with the flip of a switch in my kitchen or my water pump

40:36.780 --> 40:42.220
Like I like knowing that my fridge can be turned on and off like with these switches here

40:42.220 --> 40:47.700
like I like having manual control over all of this and then here's the other thing Noah is I like to be able to

40:47.700 --> 40:54.860
visually look at the position of that physical switch and I like to know by physically confirming the way it looks what the state of

40:54.860 --> 40:59.340
That object is and all of that's also taken away from you when all of this stuff is automated

40:59.340 --> 41:07.460
So I'm not actually I'm not able to quantify with the advantage of the totally automated home is other than I can do crap

41:07.460 --> 41:09.660
To it remotely, but that seems like a total

41:10.260 --> 41:11.140
total

41:11.140 --> 41:13.440
You know niche niche use case

41:13.440 --> 41:19.120
So I'm hoping to change your mind on that and I think I'll be I think I'm on relatively solid ground to do that

41:19.320 --> 41:23.640
Very very few things in my house are connected to the internet at the very most

41:23.640 --> 41:27.920
They're connected to the LAN and some of them aren't even connected to that a lot of the system

41:27.920 --> 41:30.120
I'd say the majority of the systems are tied together with

41:30.720 --> 41:36.120
something known as normally closed normally open and basically the idea is you have a series of contacts a series of

41:36.760 --> 41:38.560
screws and

41:38.560 --> 41:44.480
dip and either a set of contacts are closed meaning there is a piece of metal that is going between them and

41:45.000 --> 41:50.280
Electricity can flow or the contacts are open meaning there is no piece of electricity and and and electricity cannot flow

41:50.280 --> 41:53.680
I'll give you an example your garage door opener is a normally open circuit

41:53.720 --> 41:57.480
Normally the wires are separated when you push that little button to open your garage door

41:57.480 --> 42:03.640
What you're doing is shorting those two contacts together and that tells the motor start the motor up open the garage door, right?

42:03.640 --> 42:08.200
Now most of the systems in my house the door control system the security system

42:08.200 --> 42:09.280
the

42:09.280 --> 42:11.280
Even yeah, even the light system

42:11.440 --> 42:15.320
most of those are powered by this by this idea of contacts and so

42:15.800 --> 42:21.200
It's a very rudimentary way for one system to talk to the other and it's very very reliable

42:21.200 --> 42:25.400
It's very very I think I can say it's efficient as long as it's all in one room

42:25.400 --> 42:27.400
Obviously if you're gonna put control

42:27.720 --> 42:30.880
Points all over the house that would you know that would limit its efficiency

42:30.880 --> 42:35.120
But right now there's just wires that go from one system to another and the whole system works yet

42:35.120 --> 42:40.720
It really can't be compromised unless you have physical access to it and I have made a I have made a

42:41.160 --> 42:46.600
Strong point not to connect my stuff to the Internet and that's why I've shied away from things like the nest thermostat a lot

42:46.600 --> 42:48.320
Of people have asked why don't you have a nest thermostat?

42:48.320 --> 42:51.580
Well, the reason is I don't like the fact that it relies on a service

42:51.580 --> 42:53.380
I don't like the fact that it talks out to the Internet

42:53.380 --> 42:59.280
I don't like the fact that Google is going to start recording what temperature I like my house that I don't want any of that

42:59.280 --> 43:05.480
I just want the ability for the thermostat to change the temperature depending on if we're in or out of the house and

43:06.360 --> 43:09.560
There are certain things like the lights like the lights and stuff

43:09.560 --> 43:14.600
Which is nice to be able to control from a smartphone, but really I don't need to control that from outside the house

43:14.600 --> 43:18.060
I am a little worried about leaving an appliance on or something like that

43:18.200 --> 43:24.440
But the security implications and the fact that it opens it up to basically the security implications

43:24.440 --> 43:30.040
I guess that's what here's how you sell me on this and I and I am willing to admit that I would have to be

43:30.040 --> 43:36.320
The biggest idiot in the world to be sitting here in Montana on the way to your house to see your automated house

43:36.320 --> 43:41.840
And I would have to be the biggest moron in the world to say I'm not willing to change my mind on this because I'm driving

43:42.080 --> 43:44.900
Halfway across the United States of America to see this

43:45.240 --> 43:52.200
However, what I will tell you is where I sit now is the only way this seems feasible to me is if I could have

43:52.200 --> 43:57.920
Like a one new rack mount style Linux powered rig that everything was wired in over

43:58.080 --> 44:03.600
Ethernet or something into this thing and this was a central hub and I had to have a connection to that and then that

44:03.680 --> 44:06.920
That orchestrated everything for me. I mean if it was like

44:07.440 --> 44:11.920
if it was like as appliance level as installing an alarm system in your home or

44:12.680 --> 44:19.160
Installing like a sprinkler system or an air conditioner. That's the level of appliance. The home automation has to be for me to buy off

44:19.160 --> 44:22.120
how about when you're walking into your house and

44:22.680 --> 44:24.720
You want to give your nanny a key to the house?

44:24.720 --> 44:26.240
And so you give her a key to the house

44:26.240 --> 44:31.240
but she could take that down to Walmart and she could duplicate it right and the other thing is your nanny really only needs to

44:31.240 --> 44:34.440
be there between the hours of 8 and 6 p.m. Because that's when

44:34.840 --> 44:39.560
Your that's when mom and dad are gone at work and that's when the kids need to be watched after it

44:39.560 --> 44:42.880
There's no reason for her to come into your house at 2 in the morning, right?

44:42.880 --> 44:46.520
and so my access control system allows me to

44:46.520 --> 44:53.020
Authorize a key fob and I hand it to somebody and if they I can tell them that they can come in one time

44:53.440 --> 44:57.440
Any hour they're choosing I can tell them that they will come in between these hours on these specific days

44:57.440 --> 45:03.280
or I can tell them they have free access to the house until I decide that they don't and so if at some point I

45:03.880 --> 45:05.960
Have no problem giving you a key to my house Chris

45:05.960 --> 45:10.600
And if at some point we part ways and you think I'm gonna I'm gonna drive all the way back to Grand Forks, North Dakota

45:10.600 --> 45:13.600
I'm gonna sabotage Noah's house. Guess what by the time you get here your key

45:13.600 --> 45:16.560
I just I log in and I shut it back off and now you can't get back into the house

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
additionally because it's a proximity system I

45:19.400 --> 45:24.400
Have a lanyard that hangs around my neck when I have my hands full of groceries or full of boxes

45:24.400 --> 45:27.880
All I do is just swing the lanyard. It hits the side of the house and the door opens

45:28.280 --> 45:34.000
Those are the kind of automation things that I think that there are very little detractions from I don't really see a downside to it

45:34.000 --> 45:35.440
And I see a ton of advantages

45:35.440 --> 45:39.040
So I'm leveraging the advantages of technology to make my life

45:39.040 --> 45:45.880
easier as same thing with the lights coming on when you walk into my house or when you disarm the security system or when the

45:45.880 --> 45:48.720
Little transponder in my car detects that I've my cars pulled up in the driveway

45:48.920 --> 45:53.840
The entry lights come on and that is to me. There is no disadvantage to that happening

45:53.840 --> 45:56.600
It just saves me that the hassle of having to walk into my house

45:56.600 --> 46:01.700
well, I tell you I'll give you a scenario that does kind of that has crossed my mind is

46:01.700 --> 46:09.620
JB one it would be nice to be able to have to somehow grant access for Wes to be able to say here Wes

46:09.620 --> 46:14.500
Here's a token you can use Bluetooth on your smartphone and now the door will just automatically unlock for you when I'm not there

46:14.500 --> 46:15.820
That sounds great

46:15.820 --> 46:18.260
Yeah, that's the kind of thing that would be kind of nice

46:18.260 --> 46:19.140
I don't know Wes

46:19.140 --> 46:23.180
Have you have you thought at all about I know you kind of got a new place and when you're moving in have you thought?

46:23.180 --> 46:28.340
Out all about home automation and like Hughes lights and any of this kind of stuff when you're moving in you're looking at setting things up

46:28.340 --> 46:32.820
Definitely, you know a big one is I work kind of weird hours as does my wife and we have two dogs

46:32.820 --> 46:37.540
So we've we've been looking at a system where the dogs could be let out and let back in and then maybe once they've come

46:37.540 --> 46:40.340
Back in not let out again. So we're definitely interested in that kind of automation

46:41.180 --> 46:45.380
That's yeah. Yeah that for pet owners and you're working that makes a lack

46:45.380 --> 46:47.780
That's a that's a use case that makes a lot of sense to me

46:47.900 --> 46:50.980
Wes have you seen these pet doors that have a little it's you know

46:50.980 --> 46:57.660
A lot of people will put pet doors in their in their garage and so that the animal can get in and out by itself

46:57.660 --> 47:04.660
But the problem is that creates a potential security hole pun intended for unauthorized people to crawl through the doggy door

47:04.660 --> 47:10.180
Have you seen these little things that the dog wears a little RFID collar and then as the dog approaches the door it unlocks the doggy

47:10.180 --> 47:14.780
Flap the dog can go out the dog can get in but other people can't those are exactly the kind of things

47:14.780 --> 47:21.540
We're looking at we'd like to maybe experiment with making one, you know open source and easily hackable, but we haven't got that far yet

47:22.540 --> 47:24.660
yeah, yeah, I the

47:24.660 --> 47:31.620
Animal seem like anything that my line is I have a couple of hard lines in the sand one is I won't use something that

47:31.620 --> 47:35.660
Requires a service or a company to stay in business to continue using it

47:35.660 --> 47:36.940
totally agreed and

47:36.940 --> 47:42.020
The other thing is I try and stay away from is things that require the internet to work if you turn the internet off in

47:42.020 --> 47:45.180
My house all of my stuff would still work. My doors would unlock my lights would come on

47:45.580 --> 47:48.060
Everything would work just fine with or without the internet

47:48.900 --> 47:52.780
No, have you had any total failure problems like with this light bulb scenario?

47:52.780 --> 47:53.980
the

47:53.980 --> 47:59.340
closest I had to a total failure was we lost power for a couple days in a row and

48:00.900 --> 48:03.820
During that time the the so there are electromagnetic

48:04.340 --> 48:09.860
Locks that lock the doors and so if they're a fail what we would say a fail safe system

48:09.860 --> 48:11.780
It's as opposed to a fail secure system

48:11.780 --> 48:16.620
In other words if it loses power altogether the door defaults to unlock not locked, right?

48:16.620 --> 48:23.100
And that's a safety concern because if I can't I want to be able to get out of my house, right? Yeah, it was definitely so

48:23.220 --> 48:28.680
what I have done is there is a battery backup that will that will automatically kick in should the

48:29.020 --> 48:33.820
Power die and it'll power the house up to 24 to 40 some hours. It was electromagnetic

48:33.820 --> 48:38.740
yeah, so because the electromagnetic locks draw very very little power and so

48:40.020 --> 48:42.860
But once I exhausted more than a day or so

48:42.860 --> 48:47.460
the battery started to die and so what I ended up doing was I I used a

48:48.620 --> 48:55.700
Junction box into the electrical panel so I could switch from the shore power of the city over to

48:56.260 --> 49:00.740
Essentially what amounts to an extension cord that hangs off the side of my house, which was plugged into a generator. Awesome

49:00.740 --> 49:01.260
Yeah

49:01.260 --> 49:05.420
So I started the generator up and I just flipped those switches and then I was able to set

49:05.660 --> 49:10.900
The I was able to switch over and run off of my off of my own

49:10.900 --> 49:17.460
Off of my own power. Do you have any old-style keys at all? Or is it all completely digital?

49:20.060 --> 49:24.620
No, there is the I we left the traditional locks simply for appearance sake Oh

49:25.380 --> 49:27.100
Yeah, really? Yeah

49:27.100 --> 49:32.140
Well when it's kind of weird if you come up to the house and there's there's just a plate over the deadbolt and you need

49:32.140 --> 49:36.740
A handle to you know to open and shut the door so that you'll see locks. They're just they're keyed on both sides

49:36.740 --> 49:39.620
So there's no way for somebody to lock me out of my house

49:39.620 --> 49:44.620
That makes sense. Yeah, I'm really excited to see this Noah. Yeah. No, I think you'll be impressed

49:45.620 --> 49:53.260
But before I move on is there anyone in the mumble room that has that has thoughts or feedback about the about the automated house

49:53.940 --> 49:55.300
actually you

49:55.300 --> 49:58.100
earlier you were talking about how the negatives about it and

49:58.580 --> 50:03.980
I was already excited and you start talking about the negatives and you convince me I didn't want it and then you convince me

50:03.980 --> 50:05.980
Again that I do want it. Oh good. Oh

50:05.980 --> 50:13.620
good, so the mostly the stuff that you were talking about like the doors unlocking automatically, I've seen some some stuff like the

50:14.540 --> 50:16.540
Africa I think it's called the YubiKey

50:17.300 --> 50:20.500
It's like that you is it not the YubiKey

50:20.500 --> 50:26.620
But it's Yubi and it's basically like a a deadbolt that you tap your phone to it and it works

50:26.620 --> 50:32.180
But it requires the internet. So if you actually had something that already does that without any internet, that sounds awesome

50:32.180 --> 50:37.020
Yeah. Yeah. Anyone else have any thoughts either positive or negative?

50:37.740 --> 50:45.060
Yay or nay for home automation. Hey, no, how many how much research did you put into this because it sounds like you looked into

50:45.580 --> 50:50.060
Ambitious nuts and bolts on this, you know, I really did and so what it comes down to is

50:50.700 --> 50:54.400
I do research in a very strange way and probably

50:55.740 --> 50:58.860
Probably not very well supported by a lot of I love it already

50:58.860 --> 51:04.120
Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna say Chris. You know what I'm gonna say. I do research it. No, no, no

51:04.120 --> 51:06.460
I buy it. I see if it works. Oh, yeah, you buy it

51:06.460 --> 51:10.300
And here's what here's actually what you do know is you buy it you do you do some search?

51:10.300 --> 51:15.620
Maybe that you do initial obsessive phase that involves YouTube and lots of googling forum readings

51:15.960 --> 51:21.860
Reddit and then you get a very modest very average reasonable

51:23.500 --> 51:26.860
Very very good starter edition and then you realize okay

51:26.860 --> 51:29.420
This is either something bad or this is something good

51:29.420 --> 51:30.620
And if it's something good

51:30.620 --> 51:34.940
Then you have to buy the next better version because you can't have the crappy version you got to have the good version of it

51:34.940 --> 51:39.180
Right and we're gonna go into the details of exactly what the system is and exactly how it works

51:39.180 --> 51:41.580
I don't want to give any of that. I don't want to give too much of that away

51:42.100 --> 51:47.100
But yeah, I basically I bought I bought a bunch of different systems. I tried a bunch of different things

51:47.100 --> 51:51.020
I saw what works. I saw it didn't work. And the one thing I walked away with is

51:51.020 --> 51:58.060
Mess tech mesh technology is garbage this idea that one thing is going to repeat a signal to another thing is gonna repeat a signal

51:58.060 --> 52:01.220
to another thing is just a totally inefficient use of

52:01.740 --> 52:05.260
Radio bandwidth and it's just a disaster and does not work reliably

52:05.540 --> 52:11.800
Anyone who's used x10 knows exactly what I'm talking about and not that it's mesh, but it feels like a bad science project

52:11.800 --> 52:16.300
It does not feel like yeah, it does not feel like like like an automated home

52:17.420 --> 52:19.420
Anyone else have any thoughts?

52:19.420 --> 52:21.540
Yeah, I think he's got some now

52:21.540 --> 52:24.740
What do you do in the case of say like rodents getting into the wires or chewing them up?

52:24.740 --> 52:27.460
You know what happens then just out of curiosity. Yeah, what do you do?

52:27.460 --> 52:31.700
No, cuz if something or yeah or any kind of like degradation or something like that

52:31.780 --> 52:35.860
That would be horrible because like I said, everything is interconnected via wire

52:35.860 --> 52:40.100
So if wires get broken or cut or chewed or anything else bad things would happen

52:40.820 --> 52:43.380
The wires control guy on speed down. Yeah

52:43.980 --> 52:45.980
All of the wires were in the ceiling

52:45.980 --> 52:49.660
So I guess there's a couple that are in the walls that go down to the various panels and stuff

52:49.940 --> 52:53.400
But the most critical wiring is in the ceiling and then the things that go

52:54.140 --> 52:59.060
From the security system and stuff like that. I won't go into too much detail, but they're not exposed

52:59.060 --> 53:01.380
So it's not well, you can't just cut them, you know

53:01.380 --> 53:03.500
No, it's not all the wiring can be replaced

53:03.500 --> 53:08.680
What you really got to do if you're smart is you need to have that backed up and maybe you have it backed up

53:08.680 --> 53:15.660
Off-site on your own droplet. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no kidding that so I don't use I said all of my home automation stuff

53:15.660 --> 53:16.640
Isn't connected to the internet

53:16.640 --> 53:23.860
But you better believe that mice my home server and my file server and everything else that runs on my network is connected to the internet

53:24.180 --> 53:30.740
And a big thing that I've been playing with lately is MB and you know how I'm running MB is on a digital ocean droplet

53:30.740 --> 53:34.220
No kidding. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's how I set it up. And that's how I'm running

53:34.220 --> 53:37.180
And of course, I'm running it on a sensible distro, which is sent us

53:37.700 --> 53:42.860
If you if you head over to digital ocean comm and use the and use the promo code D

53:42.860 --> 53:45.860
Oh unplugged all lowercase all one word

53:45.900 --> 53:50.100
You'll get $10 credit and you can fire up your own digital ocean droplet now

53:50.740 --> 53:53.060
$10 to some people might not seem like a lot of money

53:53.060 --> 53:56.020
But when it comes to digital ocean, that's two whole droplets

53:56.020 --> 54:01.100
You can have two servers for a month on that with with that $10 promo code. I

54:01.900 --> 54:07.940
actually once I got hooked on digital ocean, I actually had to request that they expand my

54:07.940 --> 54:14.700
My droplet limit because they limit you to 25 droplets and I have exceeded 25 droplets

54:14.700 --> 54:19.020
No, actually you were in the Seattle area when you had to do that. It was hilarious. Yeah, I think so

54:19.020 --> 54:23.300
Well, here's the thing digital ocean has won. They have made me a ton of money

54:23.300 --> 54:29.820
I mean they have they have they have revolutionized my business because they essentially usually what happens in business is

54:30.500 --> 54:37.820
You hire somebody that heads up a project and then they they take that project and then deliver a profit and loss statement

54:37.820 --> 54:39.620
And figure out how they're gonna make money and all that stuff

54:39.620 --> 54:46.900
Digital ocean essentially did that for my business what they do is they allow me to set up inside of their beautiful dashboard

54:47.220 --> 54:51.860
The ability to spin up servers on the fly and I have clients all the time that call and say hey

54:52.100 --> 54:55.340
This isn't working that isn't working just last week. I had a client called me up

54:55.340 --> 54:58.140
She said our EMR system our electronic medical records

54:58.140 --> 55:00.340
The thing that we use for our patients is not working

55:00.340 --> 55:03.980
We need you to come fix this for so I go over there and their server is totally shot

55:03.980 --> 55:08.460
Now a couple years ago, I would have had to tell her that we would have to order a server from Dell

55:08.460 --> 55:10.300
It would take five the three to five business days

55:10.300 --> 55:15.360
Unless they wanted to pay for expedited shipping and expedited processing in which case I could get it there in maybe a day or two

55:15.540 --> 55:21.420
But they it would cost them an arm and a leg and then she tells me they're actually looking at switching software to something else

55:21.420 --> 55:26.500
So I said hey, I got an idea. I got a great deal for you. We'll rent you a server for 20 bucks a month

55:27.020 --> 55:31.460
And of course, it's only costing me five. So the my profit margin is built in there

55:31.460 --> 55:34.220
yeah, and you know what honestly to like

55:34.980 --> 55:39.760
There was a there was a time and a day where I worked for a company that did this and they would do it

55:39.980 --> 55:42.740
For like three hundred dollars a month the same thing

55:42.740 --> 55:47.620
And so really it's it's you know, the other thing that's really awesome about that Noah, and I know you know this

55:47.740 --> 55:52.180
But of course you could then just once if like they ever wanted to move on or if they wanted to manage it themselves

55:52.180 --> 55:57.060
You could just transfer it to them and we've done that and DigitalOcean is really really good about

55:57.060 --> 56:03.740
About helping you move one server with no no downtime. No loss of no loss of no loss of uptime

56:03.740 --> 56:06.540
They'll move it from one as they call it profile to another profile

56:06.900 --> 56:09.380
And so if they want to take control of that server

56:09.380 --> 56:12.860
They're more than welcome to do it and actually for the first time we went the other way where

56:13.380 --> 56:18.180
We had a client that we had set them up with their own account and their own server the whole nine yards and eventually they

56:18.180 --> 56:19.480
came back and said hey

56:19.480 --> 56:25.220
We would actually really appreciate it if you could manage this because it's getting to be a lot for us to do and so they just

56:25.220 --> 56:27.540
moved it over to our account and we just kind of took over and

56:28.140 --> 56:33.900
We've been managing it ever since and it has worked awesome. So head over to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code

56:34.860 --> 56:41.700
Do unplugged all lowercase to get $10 and spin up your own Linux rig. I love it

56:41.700 --> 56:46.000
I thank you digital anything to use DigitalOcean. Oh, yes. I love DigitalOcean. I use it a lot. Yeah

56:46.140 --> 56:50.100
Mm-hmm. I usually mostly use it was for VPN work and tunneling around the internet

56:50.100 --> 56:53.380
Oh, that's very good use for DigitalOcean. Awesome. Very nice

56:53.380 --> 56:55.260
so

56:55.260 --> 56:57.420
one of my all-time favorite distros

56:57.420 --> 57:05.100
In fact, I'd say it still stays as my favorite distro is fedora and fedora released fedora 23 beta edition

57:05.100 --> 57:07.740
And I have not had a chance to play with it myself

57:08.220 --> 57:14.300
but reading through reading through this release from fedora magazine org seems like

57:15.060 --> 57:18.060
They've got some pretty cool stuff that that's coming out now

57:18.060 --> 57:22.460
One of the things I've noticed of the last couple releases of fedora is it seems like they are not making

57:22.460 --> 57:26.900
They're not like plowing through making headway and sweeping changes

57:26.900 --> 57:30.580
It seems like they're they're kind of trying to stabilize and try to polish things up

57:30.660 --> 57:35.980
That's not so much the case with the with of course their their new installer package manager

57:36.540 --> 57:39.660
So there's there's a couple things that have been new in the last couple releases

57:39.660 --> 57:43.700
But it seems like 23 is shaping up to be a really really polished

57:44.820 --> 57:48.300
Linux distro and the other thing I like and I've said this before and I'll say it again

57:48.300 --> 57:53.580
I like the direction they're going with these with this workstation idea this idea that you can actually use

57:54.220 --> 57:56.860
Fedora in production and I think that there's a big

57:58.460 --> 58:01.180
Misconception about using fedora in production. I

58:01.980 --> 58:04.460
I've obviously used it on my laptop and on my desktop

58:04.460 --> 58:09.500
But I guess in the past I would have been hesitant to hand it to a client or somebody that wasn't overly familiar with Linux

58:09.500 --> 58:14.620
To use yeah, you know has it have you is it just me or does it seem like the fedora project?

58:14.620 --> 58:19.260
Also is changing in the way they message about asking for help with the betas

58:19.260 --> 58:25.980
It seems to be that they're not what they're encouraging users to use beta more, but they're also at the same time

58:25.980 --> 58:29.180
They're saying use our betas, but use it to help us find problems

58:29.180 --> 58:33.020
So, you know, it's like be very aware of what you're using it for in a much more

58:33.020 --> 58:33.940
They did a last release

58:33.940 --> 58:37.260
But I really feel like they're doing it a lot in this release and now from a selfish standpoint

58:37.340 --> 58:39.740
No, because I'm sitting right here in front of my XPS 13

58:39.740 --> 58:44.180
I got to say the improvements that they say with Wayland and we've talked about this before on unplugged

58:44.180 --> 58:46.780
Is the mixed high DPI support?

58:46.780 --> 58:54.900
So those of you who don't have high DPI at the moment if you have a Linux rig that has a high DPI display and

58:55.460 --> 58:58.140
You want to hook up a secondary display?

58:58.940 --> 59:02.740
That secondary display also runs in a pixel doubled mode

59:03.240 --> 59:07.220
So you get essentially half or more worse resolution

59:07.220 --> 59:14.780
So the only way I've actually made this usable on my XPS 13 is I have a used Apple cinema 30-inch display that I use

59:14.780 --> 59:21.940
As a second display and then I get a semi like reusable like the telegram app takes up half the screen. It's it's awful

59:21.940 --> 59:27.820
Wow, it's super weak. Yeah, it's not usable. So having mixed high DPI support is a huge deal

59:27.820 --> 59:31.720
Now you're gonna have to use Wayland to get that now, let's let's be let's be fair about this

59:31.720 --> 59:38.640
This is a short-lived problem because eventually I my personal belief is my personal prediction is within

59:39.400 --> 59:46.060
We'll say three years. Everything is gonna be high DPI. So I think that I think that this is a short-lived problem

59:46.060 --> 59:52.360
I think that in a couple of years where every monitor that you buy will support this natively and we we won't even need to

59:52.680 --> 59:56.940
It'll be it will seem like it will seem like complaining about not having a VGA port on a computer

59:56.940 --> 01:00:00.280
And I know there's gonna be somebody out there that says I have to have my VGA port

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:06.120
But but until that time until we reach that point, I guess if you had a high DPI

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:10.560
Display on your laptop and you didn't have a high D and you don't have mixed high DPI support

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:15.600
That would be a real problem. Yeah, but you're right. That's like a limited time issue. I see what you're saying

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:16.520
Yeah, it's not gonna be a big deal

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:21.680
Okay here speaking of something that feels like something maybe more down the road and I'm sure it's not gonna work for a lot

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:25.760
Of hardware. I don't have a lot of high expectations for this particular bullet point in the feature list

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:29.120
But this is what they say the software application is smarter

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:34.080
And it now has the ability to update system firmware

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:38.060
We've talked about this before but system firmware updates through GNOME software to me

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:42.200
I seem like a big deal that to me is like that's like

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.680
MacBook

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:51.120
Level like, you know Apple sending you a UEFI firmware for your MacBook update and you get update through the software center now

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:58.880
With GNOME software. I'm sure the initial support is going to be limited but you're gonna be able to update system firmware through

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:03.180
GNOME software under Fedora that feels like a super integrated

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:08.920
2015 consumer experience to me and hopefully now if someone will and hopefully now if someone will you know

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:13.220
They're like taking the lead here. So if people do want, you know to better support firmware updates with Linux

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:16.020
They have a project they can go to and get it integrated right away. Yeah, good point

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:22.060
Yeah, what took him so long is what Anthony says what took him so long. Yes. How about exactly? What do you guys think?

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:29.820
Anyone's system the system firmware stuff like how like what exactly is it offering to update? Is it UEFI stuff?

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:32.900
I'm not exactly sure when they say on the bullet point here

01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:35.820
They just say system firmware now when I we covered it before in the past

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:42.260
I looked into it and it was essentially like anything any hardware that can distribute a free open source firmware

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:46.060
Could potentially if they package it up correctly get updated through this

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:49.700
I don't think it has to be anything in particular the key there though

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:55.700
Right is if it it's if it has proprietary blobs if it if it if it's something that is, you know

01:01:55.700 --> 01:02:00.100
Proprietary it's not gonna work through the system and if it's something where they don't I don't know exactly

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:02.900
But if they don't take the prep work, it won't work either

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.500
So I would imagine it's fairly limited

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:10.600
But then again if you want to be known as the best Linux Wi-Fi card or the best Linux

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.520
Video capture device or something like that

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:17.160
Then maybe you're the vendor that goes above and beyond and starts to support the system before somebody else does

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.120
Yeah

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.320
So, you know, it'll be interesting do we I didn't pull it up here

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:27.400
When is the when they usually do here we go. Here's a release schedule

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.600
Do we know when the actual when the at 123 will actually be out?

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.120
they just say October and

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.640
They say October in the list, you know

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:42.920
And I the reason why I hate to say more specific than that is because it doesn't and when's the last time a fedora release

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:47.320
Didn't get bumped a little bit. Never never it always does but you know what I support that

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:52.600
I support that decision because I would rather them take an extra month an extra two months and fix the stuff that they're holding

01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:56.560
The release rather than just put it out there and say oh, we'll patch it there. We'll update it

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:59.160
No, just if it takes an extra month or two, that's fine

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:04.720
The way I do fedora releases and this is not a hit on fedora. This is I think this is just good practice

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.560
I have a machine that I use daily and then I have another machine that I use

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:14.000
You know kind of at night just to kind of you know, check my email and do stuff like that

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:20.600
I will usually install the latest version of fedora on that machine and then run it for a month or two and make sure that

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:25.160
All the kinks and all the bugs and and all my software works and on all that stuff on

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:31.320
It first before I actually move my daily driver over to it and I think that's a good way to do it

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:37.240
You know, what strikes me about the fedora project really is and I I mean

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:41.640
Maybe maybe he just successfully has his he batted his eyes at me and he impressed me

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:45.640
but I talked with Matthew Miller at Linux con and

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:51.940
You know, I really liked sort of and actually what I forget Noah who the other gentleman we were talking to from Red Hat

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:58.380
But he was he was talking about some of the things that fedora project and it may be even more so Red Hat have worked on

01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:04.260
That they are unable to really advertise because it would actually expose them to greater risk

01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:07.020
So I don't even want to go into too much detail here because this was a private conversation

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:11.820
But what they told me was essentially there has been major accomplishments. They have made

01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:15.860
That they don't really advertise and I bet this is true for a lot of companies

01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:18.400
I bet this is probably not a Red Hat specific thing

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:26.300
It's probably true for Intel and canonical and a lot of different companies that they make these legal battles or they they they resolve these

01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:29.340
Issues, but the reason you can't talk about it is because if you say

01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:32.580
Let's just say it's the ability to burn a CD under Linux

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:35.940
Let's just say it's like there was some code that had to be licensed to do that

01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:38.540
And if you if you announce that you licensed it

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:43.980
Then you're essentially exposing yourself open to potential lawsuits down the road

01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:47.740
so you don't say anything even though it was a major benefit to the desktop and

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:52.340
That's that is one of the things that when I look at Fedora

01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:56.220
I like a lot about it is I like the people behind Fedora

01:04:56.220 --> 01:05:00.060
I like the people leading Fedora and I like the company support supporting Fedora

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:03.300
That's one of the reasons I was at Ubuntu user for a really long time too. So

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.100
Fedora 23 coming out in October. That's sort of like

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:11.780
Interesting the major topic the takeaway for me is man

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:16.220
Fedora is looking really compelling and and you got to have some perspective when I say this because

01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:19.460
You you do a snapshot of I don't know five six years ago

01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:22.020
And I might have been one of the biggest Fedora haters around

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.420
I mean I even a year ago

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:27.860
I didn't really think it was that practical of a distro until until 21 started coming out

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:33.140
Then I started changing my tune and I guess for me what and I it's willful ignorance

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:36.300
I guess is what it was because I had started with Red Hat and

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:40.540
Then I had moved in for to Fedora and I'd have been using it since Fedora core 1

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:48.060
so I had just I had just learned to deal with some of the shortcomings of Fedora and I just I was like it for

01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:52.340
Me it wasn't Oh Fedora doesn't do these things and those other distros do for me

01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:57.500
It was just my computer doesn't do those things and and that's it's a good thing

01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:03.700
And it's a bad thing on what it's a bad thing because I think I was I think I was unaware of how powerful Linux really

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:08.100
Was but I think it's a good thing because it allowed it allowed me to have an appreciation for

01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:10.980
for to appreciate Fedora for what it was and

01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:17.620
As you as you as you pointed out the company behind Fedora is so great

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:21.380
I have a large respect for Red Hat even more now after having visited with them

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:26.980
I mean, let me tell you the people at Red Hat. They are some really authentic live Linux loving folks and

01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:32.180
I'm I'm trying to think it was it was it at the was it at the after-party?

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:38.780
Yeah, that you were talking to. Yep. Yep. Okay, and so I I think I know who that was

01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:43.980
But yeah, but but yeah, you can tell from talking to him, right? He's a very authentic guy

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.300
He's he's he's he it's it's not just a show and it's not a tagline

01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.660
Those are core beliefs to people like that

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:56.900
And yeah, and also I wouldn't just say that I would also say some serious like perspective on the community and on the landscape

01:06:56.900 --> 01:07:02.940
And and not just like a lot of times when you talk to people they have a very very strong

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:06.860
Corporate bias, you know, they they see the world through a corporate lens

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:09.100
I'm sure that's the case for Red Hat employees too

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:11.820
But when we were having, you know with 20-minute casual conversation

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:16.420
it was really I got the sensation that he had a broader perspective and

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:21.780
And what was nice about that is two other Red Hat employees walked up and they also gave me that same impression

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:25.740
They have the corporate perspective and then they have the broader open source perspective

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:29.580
And that I found very refreshing. Yeah, and they're the first people, you know

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:34.700
I walked in there and I was talking about how how much I appreciated their training program and

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:41.940
They talked about and I asked them I said tell me what advantages Red Hat offers over its competitors

01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:44.980
And none of them could answer the question all of them looked at me and they went

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:48.460
You mean like the other people in the community? We all kind of work together

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:53.460
I mean, I mean there's some things that canonical does that we use and we do a lot of stuff that canonical uses

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:57.000
but I don't I guess we don't really have a competitive thing as we

01:07:57.380 --> 01:08:01.680
We just make what we need and we do the work and we support the project

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.660
It does help when you are standing on stacks of billions of dollars

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:10.540
It does but my point is they don't they don't say they don't say we're standing out

01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:14.100
We have the the financial resources to make this project

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:18.740
Succeed and so that's what we leverage over these other companies. They don't view it that way

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:24.300
They just view it as a contribution that everyone can benefit from and the thing is I

01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:28.380
Mean to some degree. I appreciate where they're coming from to some degree

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:32.420
I sometimes I think they're short-selling themselves because I when I went through the Red Hat training program

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:34.420
I was absolutely blown away

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:40.720
the fact that I was being tested on real hardware with real problems save the internet because I know we disagree on that point but

01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:47.700
The way that they the way that the training was conducted the fact that the instructor was using a Red Hat machine the entire

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:50.340
Time all the notes were available to us in

01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:55.980
Open office like it's it's the little things like that that just made it if you were a Linux user and you wanted to be

01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:59.700
Immersed in Linux you could do the Linux training now these days

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:01.900
owning a full-time business

01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:07.560
There's something that nobody ever tells you about owning a small business and that is when you go into business for yourself

01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:15.440
You have the ability to you might be a really good electrical person that electrician and you can run electrical wires

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:19.920
But if you're gonna go into business for yourself you actually have to know the business side of it, too

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:25.000
And the thing they don't tell you about that is that business side of it takes a ton of time and so now I just I

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:30.680
Don't have the time to go for a week off to a Red Hat training course to get certified in in in the latest

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.680
In the latest Red Hat certification

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:38.200
But what I do have time for is late at night in two of the morning in my skippy sitting down with my laptop and going

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:44.120
To Linux Academy now Linux Academy if you use the if you use the URL Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:48.360
You'll get 33% off and let me tell you I actually paid full price

01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.920
I think the first time I signed up because I didn't know about the program

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:55.400
I didn't know about the promo code and I thought that was a good deal. So 33% off. That's a huge deal

01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:02.780
Now they are they're actually working to to help find you a job help get you into the career space and you

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:06.520
Linux Academy comm they'll be willing to help you with that. I

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:12.040
Actually am just getting ready to take my Red Hat 7 certification

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:17.520
And in the past the past couple versions of Red Hat what I've had to do is drive the nearest training center is Minneapolis

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:22.240
So that's a four-hour drive for me actually closer to five probably and when I get to Minneapolis

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:27.280
I have to rent a hotel that's money. I'm not working. So that's money. I'm paying to eat out every day

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:33.360
That's money plus I'm paying for the course and let me tell you while the courses are absolutely top-notch and I absolutely love them

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:38.740
They're expensive and so that's money and then I have to actually pay to take the test and then of course the gas to go

01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:40.000
back and forth

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.920
With Linux Academy. I'm doing it for literally a fraction of that price and I can I can I can get certified

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.920
In the next version of Red Hat all I can't actually take the test

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:55.360
But I can do all of the prep work and learn all of the material right on their website now the other thing

01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:56.600
I really like about

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.280
Linux Academy is the concept of the snippets

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:02.880
When I first got into when Ralph 7 first came out

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:07.000
The first thing I had to do was learn how to support it for clients. I didn't care about certification

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.880
I didn't care about what was gonna be on the test. What I wanted to know was the practical advice

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:17.000
How can I actually make this work and Linux Academy worked with me on that and said these are these are the five or six

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.840
things I need to know and

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.840
so they

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.920
And so they said here I told them these are the five or six things

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.840
I need to know and they said here's how much time you need to allocate and here are the things that modules that you need

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.840
To go through and and learn this stuff

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:30.440
Yeah

01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:36.560
That helped me that when I when I saw like when I was trying to decide if I'm gonna take on Ruby or Python and being

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:40.600
Able to put both of them into a four hours or five hours or six hour perspective

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.040
I know I've mentioned this before Noah

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:48.360
But to me that is like goes from this big really weird like concept that I'm gonna learn a programming language

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:53.440
To I'm gonna spend five hours doing a thing and that made it much more approachable now

01:11:53.440 --> 01:12:00.120
Think about that if I had told you Ruby is a really cool language and your your troll up in the upstairs

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:02.800
Your live-in troll says that you should learn Ruby

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:07.920
Would you have taken time out of your week and paid money to go to a course to learn programming or would you have?

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:12.280
Simply said hey, you know what? I'm not a programmer. I don't have time for this. I'm running a podcast network

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:16.000
I have three kids. I'm trying to launch new show. I have all these things going on

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:16.720
I don't have time for that

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:18.480
But then if you if then if you say well

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:21.160
Here's I want you to open your laptop and instead of watching TV

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:25.520
Click around through this right and you'll learn how to program right jeez anyone can get on board with that

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:32.640
And you know if you're somebody like me where sometimes your your version of playing gaming on your computer is actually like tinkering with your distro

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:36.240
Or messing around with your computer Linux Academy also scratches that same itch

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.240
Yeah

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:45.680
So so yeah Linux Academy dot-com slash unplugged Linux Academy comm slash unplug because then you'll get the automatic discount

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:51.780
Yeah, 33 percent. That's a heck of a discount. I know you know that number isn't accidentally picked. I don't think I think it had special meaning

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:53.600
hmm

01:12:53.600 --> 01:13:00.960
Okay, so we were gonna talk this week about the the automatic like block backup system wimpy was trying that out

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:04.520
However, I don't see him in the room. You know he's on wireless connection, too

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:06.180
So I have to be gentle with him

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:08.800
I can't give him a hard time if he can't make it that's that seems legit

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:13.480
So I thought I would talk a little bit just for a moment then about the last couple of weeks

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:17.800
there's been a pretty important topic to me, and that's taking things offline and

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:23.400
Pretending like I'm online just sort of like that could be a lot of things like anything from search to

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.320
media content or things like that and

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:30.960
I've I've kind of have a couple of different ideas in mind, but

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:35.480
Since I'm on the road. I thought maybe specifically I'd talk about ideas

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:40.240
I had for the rover and Noah bad news some of it involves project time when I get to your place

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:43.760
Oh, that's what you're talking about. That's great news, dude. I know I'm excited

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:49.680
Listen anytime somebody's willing to let me drill holes and take parts off, and I'm just kidding, but I

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.240
I'm all over doing project. I think it'll be fun

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:57.480
Yeah, no, I think it'll be fun, and you know what the great thing is here's what Chris's answer every time

01:13:57.480 --> 01:14:01.320
I I'm like oh, you know we have we have this problem where we have this here's his answer

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:05.640
It's become kind of a joke. It's all show content. That's right. That's you're gonna get to see it

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:10.040
That is very true. It does even even when my well my rings on the side of the road

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:12.600
It still ends up in being a show content, so

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:16.480
West have you continued to work with MB? I mean you still set it up

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:20.360
What are your thoughts couple day or I guess maybe a week and a half since we?

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:26.160
First talked about two weeks three weeks as we first talked about it and a week since we first recorded our segment any follow-up

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:28.160
thoughts

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:30.520
You know I'm still fairly impressed

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:38.120
I've been adding more content using you know file bots been working great the directory structure hasn't been too onerous at least for my personal

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:38.880
collection

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:42.880
And honestly I've been pretty impressed. You know a lot of that credit goes to f of M peg

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.320
But I built it on a rather

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.480
Let's say it's not generously spec'd it'll be upgraded at some point

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.760
But you know I'm loading it down pretty good transcoding 1080p streams and hardly hiccup

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:57.160
I will say sometimes when you need to jump around in the video that can be a little laggy

01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.840
But once it picks up it seems to be continuous, so I'm having great time

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:01.960
Well, I think I'll be oh yeah

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:06.440
I was kind of that was kind of that's where I'm at too is I think I'm thinking about doing the donation once I get

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:10.720
Back from the road trip if I have the funds, but I was telling Anthony before we went on the air

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.440
Right where he's sitting right now or perhaps where I'm sitting

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:18.960
I'm not sure so one of the cool things about the current rover setup is the mobile studio all

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:23.520
Collapses down and it goes underneath the seat that's at the depth of like the dinner table

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:27.800
So I'm able to completely just get rid of all of this when we're driving and it's all safe

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:34.440
And it all fits under the seat, but there's another seat where we have that same storage area now. It's a very nice storage area

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.440
It's mostly filled with toilet paper at the moment

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:39.740
Truth be told the essentials exactly

01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:47.080
But I was thinking there is a storage compartment in the side of the RV that is sort of lined up with where that seat is

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:50.860
At and if I were to fill that storage compartment with a bank of batteries

01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.260
I could then put an inverter underneath that seat

01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:56.900
I could then put a NUC and a NAS under that seat and a router and

01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:01.340
Then when I wanted to charge that bank of batteries because it would be in that storage compartment

01:16:01.340 --> 01:16:09.020
I would simply open up that storage compartment and then run the solar chargers to it charge over solar or whatever the source power would

01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:14.260
Be and then have it come back into the inverter right here underneath your butt. Basically. Does that seem solid to you?

01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:17.300
That seems very solid. Now. What do you think Noah? Is this an impossible task?

01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:19.420
No, I don't think it's an impossible task

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:23.420
The only thing I want to add to that and I you I'll be completely honest

01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:26.260
You kind of lost me in the middle of that when you're describing it

01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:32.180
but the only thing I would add is I would want somehow your battery bank inside the camper to be connected to the battery bank on

01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:39.660
The front of the camper and the reason I say that is because the front bank of the camper is what's tied into the charging

01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:43.960
Inverter of the camper as well as the charging connector that goes into your truck

01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:48.220
So anytime you're plugged into shore power or anytime you're plugged into your truck

01:16:48.220 --> 01:16:53.340
I would think you'd want all the batteries available to charge as much as they can right that is true

01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:58.220
Yeah, that is a good point. I was actually thinking about running as so I had two ideas

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:03.900
So I was thinking I could tie it into the main trailer power system and then I would have the advantages of shore power

01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:08.620
Charging that battery bank. I would have the advantage of lighting up all of the AC outlets in here

01:17:08.620 --> 01:17:11.700
And I would have the advantage of trickle charging while I'm driving

01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:12.460
however

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:13.260
I

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:20.360
Could also use that as a separate isolated power system that just powers all of the computer gear essentially all of the studio gear all

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:26.900
Of the Linux server stuff and all of that that has its own separate source of power that is all completely off of the RV

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:29.540
System, so they mean there's two ways to go both have their downs and ups

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:35.860
Well, it sounds like you're you're developing quite the list. I know that when I did my RV

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:37.660
It took me a good two years

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:43.140
To flush out all of the things I wanted to do and and then I would do some of them and then I would go

01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:45.300
Back and redo. I'm curious. Have you come up with that?

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:49.180
Have you have you done anything that you said that you've now after living in it?

01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:52.540
You've said well actually if I had that to do that over again, I would do it this way instead

01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:59.780
Yeah, I mean this this this battery bank that I'm talking about is probably the biggest thing actually is now that we're here doing shows

01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:05.580
And I'm sitting here watching my both my both my laptops. I'm sitting in front of me are down to 40% battery and

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:08.500
Just you know this is

01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:12.480
And I think okay this this power thing

01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:17.580
Here's what we're doing to save money to be honest with you is we're boondocking a lot more is

01:18:17.580 --> 01:18:24.380
We're kind of just we're finding places that have good cellular coverage and we're staying there and they don't necessarily have power hookups

01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:26.460
Which means we're running off the battery a lot more

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:28.980
Do you?

01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:32.460
You don't you have that thousand trails membership that gets you free camping at places

01:18:33.220 --> 01:18:36.020
If there's one along us 90, but there's not

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:42.340
There's nothing along us. This is Montana. There's not much out there. Trust me. Yeah, that's really something

01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:48.980
No, well a boondocking is kind of fun, and if you think about it really boondocking is the best way to test your your true

01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:50.540
offline ability

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:53.020
Because you're you're literally reliant on nothing

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:58.300
Yeah, just for those of you who are not familiar with the term because before I knew anything about trailers and RVs

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.300
I didn't know what the hell boondocking was it is

01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:03.020
Like it's basically a fancy term of dry camping

01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:08.980
It's it's a trailer or an RV where you live off the grid you still have power because you have your furnace you have your water

01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:13.540
Tanks you have your you have your your your your sewage tanks, and you have propane

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:18.300
So you can completely be self-contained and you can go anywhere and basically live off the grid

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:19.940
And you call that boondocking a lot of times

01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:26.540
It's urban camping is another term people call like you know and and some places like Walmart's and yes

01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:32.460
What cracker barrels and a lot of other places all you know they actually like it because they want you to be their customer

01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:35.580
And so it's it's it's an interesting culture there

01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:41.540
And we've been we've been meeting different people and they've all been really cool and every single one

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:46.580
Has a different technology implementation and we walk around sometimes some of the different parks

01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:51.260
And we're checking out like the different antennas that they have hooked up and some people have like flat ones in their window

01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:56.660
Some people have big ones they have out in their yard that are wired into their rigs and all of these people are coming with

01:19:56.660 --> 01:20:01.740
Different technology solutions. It's it's not it's the it's not like these are technology dead spots

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:06.460
There's a there's a lot of different ingenuity going on here and a lot of maker stuff. I'm seeing that's really cool

01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:14.660
That's awesome. The the the concept of see and in the thing is my next goal is to get you involved with ham radio because

01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:18.140
It ties in so nicely with the concept

01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:22.700
well from with the concept of open source with the concept of maker with the concept of

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.180
You know doing everything yourself

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:29.620
The one thing that you you are somewhat reliant on right now is connectivity to other places now

01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:32.900
It's not ham radio isn't necessarily gonna help you with the broadcasting side

01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:38.980
But it would definitely help you if you ever wanted to get a message from one person to the other and you didn't have cell phone

01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:43.580
Service, you wouldn't need it. I don't know what what kind of like I'm gonna have to be honest, but I'm willing to try

01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:50.340
And I and I think that as you I think that as you continue to move towards this idea of wanting control over your own

01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:55.460
Every end of it like you were talking about controlling every individual like controlling when the water heater is on and when the water heaters

01:20:55.460 --> 01:21:00.780
Off that kind of intense control intense flexibility and intense self-reliance

01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:04.500
Just goes like just dovetails perfectly with ham radio

01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:06.080
The only thing I'm you know

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:11.860
when I do all of this is my my default right now would be like use arch for all these different little machines to run these

01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:16.340
Different things and the only thing is is I'm just not sure that's gonna work in an offline scenario

01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:18.340
So that's one thing I'm revisiting

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:21.940
And there's some stuff that I have to kind of reevaluate when I think about some of this

01:21:21.940 --> 01:21:26.340
It's like how would I really do this if I have to actually be offline could I take an arch box offline?

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:31.180
And if I go offline is it only offline for two three weeks at a time is maybe a week at most

01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:34.100
But then if I go can I go somewhere I can get a lot of updates

01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:39.240
There's little things like that when using Linux that are different than using some of the other commercial operating systems

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:45.340
But then the flip side is I have the main thing that I need and that is the ability to live offline on my own

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:48.160
No subscription necessary and like we were talking about the beginning

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:54.520
I'm not gonna also be victims of marketing whims of these different companies. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's a big one

01:21:54.520 --> 01:22:00.540
Right is it well, I guess that goes back to I guess that goes back to my thing of just anything that requires a company

01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.060
or a service

01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:06.140
Yeah, I know. I know you always make that point Wes. Are you so Wes?

01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:07.420
Where do you fall on this?

01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:11.860
So Noah's kind of coming down on the lines like he won't even get a Roku for his house because he doesn't want to be

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:15.100
Tied to the Roku service and this is one of the reasons he's a big Linux fan, too

01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:20.320
Where do you where do you fall on like West stuff? That's like dependent on a third-party service to continue to function long-term

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:23.020
You know, I'm definitely skeptical as well

01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:25.140
I I do use some of them, you know

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:28.900
My some of my family members have smart TVs and I've set up some streaming to those and that kind of thing

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:29.740
But you do, you know

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:31.060
You have to be very aware that

01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:36.340
You're kind of just risking the time thing as soon as that platform decides to stop supporting the service you happen to use

01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:39.020
You're you're out and it'll be an anachronism before

01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:43.420
Your take on this too because I have a whole nother complaint when it comes to smart TVs

01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:47.420
Smart TVs are these devices that even if LG stays in business

01:22:47.420 --> 01:22:50.780
Which I think they will and even if they continue to support their platform, which I think they will

01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:55.740
the fact that those apps constantly get updated, but the hardware is stuck and

01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:00.660
Instead of replacing with the Roku we're talking about a 30 40 50 60 70 dollar box, right?

01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:04.180
When it comes to the TV right now, we're talking about I mean

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:08.020
I've paid a couple hundred dollars for for free for any decent TV

01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:12.060
And if you buy a real big one in your basement, and you're looking at twelve thirteen hundred dollars

01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:14.540
you know how mad I'd be if in three years I

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:17.060
go to take that out and

01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:21.900
Or I go to I go to update it and I realize I can no longer open Netflix on my smart TV

01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:22.340
Yeah

01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:29.540
Because the ARM processor in it is not capable of running the newest version of Netflix because they've literally quadrupled in speed in four years

01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:32.220
That is definitely the stage that technology is at

01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:39.580
Yeah, so I mean that and that's that's not specific the Roku where you gain some solid ground Chris and where I don't really have

01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:41.300
a leg to stand on is

01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.780
It principally I think I'm on safe ground

01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:49.060
But the problem becomes that the Roku is such a cost-effective device that it literally becomes

01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:52.520
Almost disposable, you know when you're talking about, you know

01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:56.880
You've said this and I think you're right when you're looking at 50 or 60 bucks anything under 100

01:23:56.980 --> 01:24:00.920
Really if it gets you a couple of years it served its purpose you what I mean

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:06.140
You got your use out of it and then you can go get some I think that's why the Chromecast is so successful because it

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:10.060
Is you know, it's so cheap. Even if you can't do everything with it. It does enough for it. So I know

01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:17.740
Right. Yeah, the other thing about that but again, so and the Chromecast I come I become conflicted on I had we had a

01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:18.900
meeting room

01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:25.060
For a client and what they wanted to do was they wanted to obviously project from their laptop up on onto the screen

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:29.200
So we had run an HDMI cable in the wall while the room was being built and all that stuff

01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:34.480
Do you know what turned out to be a way easier solution was putting a Chromecast in there and now every

01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:37.540
Guest that sits down even if there's like six of them in a room

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:43.940
They can take turns who is sharing their screen up on up on the Chromecast and that was I mean

01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:46.660
It was thirty freaking dollars. It required no actual

01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:49.620
Wiring we didn't have to do anything in the walls or anything like that

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:57.100
It was brain-dead simple to set up and it's actually worked super well on the flip side of the coin if Google ever

01:24:57.420 --> 01:24:59.420
decides not to support the Chromecast which

01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:01.940
Could be next week for all we know

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:06.580
Not only not only are they out there there, you know 40 bucks for the Chromecast

01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:11.020
But now they're out of solution now the thing that they were relying on to be able to get stuff up on this meeting room

01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:14.380
TV is is host and I guess that's what kind of bothers me

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.140
Yeah, I have a personal example

01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:21.980
We were looking to use a Groupon has some software where you can have like kind of point of sale displays where you can set

01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:26.340
Up links for various Chromecasts and have a web interface where you can manage what each Chromecast is displaying

01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:31.300
So you can kind of easily easily change them and we were looking to use that at work for looking at graphs and that kind

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:35.140
Of stuff but you know where you what you get with the convenience you lose in the custom

01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:40.800
Ability, so we're looking to use at the new Ethernet adapters that they have but a lot of the security implications

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:44.520
We just couldn't you know, we have to use Raspberry Pi's because you can't lock down a Chromecast, you know

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:48.620
You just don't have the option if you if they lose power. They instantly come back as a wireless access point

01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:52.960
Yeah, so what what what you've you've you've done that with a Raspberry Pi

01:25:53.760 --> 01:26:00.300
We're implementing something that will be essentially the same but we don't get to take advantage of Groupon's awesome open-source project unfortunately

01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:04.280
All right. Well, that's cool. There was I don't know if you caught in in Linux action show this week

01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:08.860
There was a guy that was talking about the fruit party and how you can how everyone names their

01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:13.120
Everyone names their mini little computer after some form of a fruit. That's awesome

01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:19.220
So Chris any other final thoughts of of using Linux offline

01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:22.500
No, I think I'm gonna something I'm gonna reflect on some more

01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:27.500
Because we are about to go through unless I'm wrong Anthony pretty much

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:31.260
The most of the rest of the stretch in Montana is gonna be offline, right?

01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:36.500
I don't know once you get past Billings. It's gonna be pretty rough. Yeah, and Billings is our next destination

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:38.500
So I think so we'll see

01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:42.160
So I'll probably have some more thoughts after that and I'll say

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:47.540
Also this if you want to follow the destination as long as we have some level of connectivity should be able to over at Jupiter

01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:54.480
Broadcasting comm slash rover and I don't know if I'll be able to post updates as often since we'll have limited connectivity

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:58.420
But you can also find a link to the playlist over on the rover webpage and we just posted one last night

01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:03.120
We have now have seven seven of the rover logs go check those out and new patrons

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:08.940
Also some exclusive stuff over at patreon.com slash today some really cool personal touch just for you

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.700
All right

01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:13.740
Well, that'll bring us to the end of this week's episode

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:16.980
Join us at Jupiter broadcasting comm

01:27:16.980 --> 01:27:27.740
Or jblive.tv every week and we'll see you again next week

01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:48.980
You

01:27:57.380 --> 01:28:02.380
Well for flying by the seat of our pants I wasn't too bad no, I think that went pretty good good job sir

01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:07.740
Good job. No, you're awesome. Yeah. Well, here's the thing you should I'm gonna take a picture when I get done

01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:09.740
of what this room looks like I

01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:16.660
It has been fun like I was literally walking why is it every every 15 seconds I'd look around and I'm like

01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:18.660
Oh, I have to do this or I have to get that done

01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:21.660
Yeah, I

01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:24.820
You were quick on the quick on the telegram though. That works pretty well

01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:31.540
Yeah. Yeah. Well, I have I have one computer that's dedicated to tell the past him. You've lost me. You've lost me

01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:34.260
No, you haven't lost me. I'm here. Sorry. Okay, great. Sorry about that. I

01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:39.580
Yeah, I have I have one computer that's just dedicated to to telegram

01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:44.400
So that computer that had one laptop that was set up and I'm like, this is just the computer

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.580
I'm going to use to communicate with people. So

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:53.280
I hear that there was a Skype out yesterday and that has thrown a serious wrench into your plans of

01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:57.380
Doing a mobile studio on Skype. Yeah, man. That was awful

01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:04.860
We were all wired in sounded actually really good and I had good connection and then I was able to log in the studio

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:08.620
Thankfully after a little while I was able to get connecting the studio and talk to the live stream

01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:12.180
But for a while, I thought it was like I thought it was an issue with the connectivity

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:15.780
I thought it was an I didn't know what was going on because I figured it was on my end because I'm in the mobile

01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:18.220
Studio, so it must be my fault that I can't get logged into Skype

01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:24.140
Yeah, but you you and so and so somewhere along the lines you were like this just isn't gonna work, huh?

01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:29.060
Well about 50 minutes after the show was supposed to start we decided to bail

01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:29.620
Yeah

01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:33.460
So basically we kept trying to push it kept trying to push it and I just you know

01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:38.540
And I had to vamp for 15 minutes on the live stream while I'm waiting for Mike to try to get connected

01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:42.300
You know, I have to be honest with you. I have a new I started my newfound

01:29:42.620 --> 01:29:47.480
appreciation for what you do for a living back when we were at the back when we were itself and it's like

01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:51.220
I don't think I really don't think people get it

01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:53.060
Like I think as as a viewer

01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:56.780
I think I had like a general idea of kind of what I've kind of what you did

01:29:56.780 --> 01:30:00.900
But you don't really get it until you're like you're gonna sit here and talk for six hours and come up with something

01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:04.780
Something to say and it actually has to be something pseudo interesting to keep people listening

01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:10.020
And then while you're doing all that you also have to handle the chat room and do all the auto stuff and then deal with

01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:15.380
