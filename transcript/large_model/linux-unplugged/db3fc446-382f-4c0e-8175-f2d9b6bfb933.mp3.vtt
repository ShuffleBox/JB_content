WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.240
You're a Star Trek fan, Wes.

00:01.240 --> 00:03.120
You know about synthohol.

00:03.120 --> 00:05.040
It seemed like an impossibility.

00:05.040 --> 00:08.600
You could have a beer that was made with synthohol,

00:08.600 --> 00:10.160
and you could feel the effects of booze

00:10.160 --> 00:12.400
without actually getting fully drunk.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.280
Well, yeah, it sounds amazing.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.240
I want that.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.240
I enjoy a drink from time to time.

00:17.240 --> 00:19.640
But we all have to admit, like, there are consequences,

00:19.640 --> 00:21.360
both personal and social.

00:21.360 --> 00:23.280
But how many times do you hear, like,

00:23.280 --> 00:25.440
in the open source and free software community,

00:25.440 --> 00:28.360
free isn't beer, or let's go have a beer.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.520
Like, everybody's always talking about beer.

00:30.520 --> 00:32.160
It's pervasive in our society.

00:32.160 --> 00:33.520
It really is.

00:33.520 --> 00:37.400
Yeah, well, there is a guy out there whose last name is Nut,

00:37.400 --> 00:38.000
really.

00:38.000 --> 00:38.760
David Nut.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.760
Yeah, we'll have this linked in the show notes.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.960
He's got an ambitious plan to bring, like,

00:42.960 --> 00:44.480
a synthohol to the market.

00:44.480 --> 00:49.040
Safe synthetic alcohol substitute called Alkarell.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.240
He's kind of actually been playing with this for a long

00:51.240 --> 00:54.400
time with the so-called holy grail of molecules,

00:54.400 --> 00:56.280
at least if you really want to develop

00:56.280 --> 00:57.960
this one specific molecule.

00:57.960 --> 00:59.440
It's also called AlkaSynth.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.040
And really, what they're aiming for

01:01.040 --> 01:03.480
is something that provides the relaxing and socially

01:03.480 --> 01:06.520
lubricating qualities of alcohol that we all know and love,

01:06.520 --> 01:08.520
but without the hangovers, health issues,

01:08.520 --> 01:10.360
or the risk of getting paralytic.

01:10.360 --> 01:11.800
If that was really true, especially

01:11.800 --> 01:14.320
that social lubrication there, I think

01:14.320 --> 01:15.960
we would all have to drink this before we

01:15.960 --> 01:17.440
start doing the show, you know?

01:17.440 --> 01:18.520
Absolutely, why not?

01:18.520 --> 01:21.800
I mean, right now, all I have is this damn whiskey to sip on.

01:21.800 --> 01:27.520
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 294 from March 26, 2019.

01:27.520 --> 01:40.880
Oh, hello there, and welcome to your weekly Linux talk show

01:40.880 --> 01:43.120
that might be a little too ambitious this week.

01:43.120 --> 01:43.920
My name is Chris.

01:43.920 --> 01:44.800
My name is Wes.

01:44.800 --> 01:45.520
I don't know, Wes.

01:45.520 --> 01:48.720
I'm looking through this list, and I'm saying it's too much.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.560
But this week, on your Unplugged program,

01:51.560 --> 01:53.320
we'll go through some community news,

01:53.320 --> 01:55.440
including the release of the most important text

01:55.440 --> 01:58.720
editor ever created, and an OS.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.440
Well, a distro?

02:00.440 --> 02:01.440
They call it an OS.

02:01.440 --> 02:04.360
It's really a distro that seems to be getting

02:04.360 --> 02:05.800
a little bit of controversy.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.160
When's the last time you've heard

02:07.160 --> 02:08.520
about a controversial distro?

02:08.520 --> 02:09.920
Oh, it's been a while.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.120
That's funny, because the press is calling it

02:12.120 --> 02:13.400
a controversial OS.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.120
But no, no, it's a distro, and we'll tell you more about it

02:16.120 --> 02:17.200
in a little bit.

02:17.200 --> 02:22.080
And then, later on, have you ever heard of a tainted kernel?

02:22.080 --> 02:25.720
You might be one of those Linux users out there right now that

02:25.720 --> 02:27.560
has a dirty, tainted kernel.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.720
We'll tell you what the heck that is, what causes that,

02:30.720 --> 02:34.400
and why the kernel team doesn't want nothing to do with it,

02:34.400 --> 02:36.160
and what you can do afterwards.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.160
And then, later on, in the show, we'll

02:39.160 --> 02:42.440
talk about advocacy in a way that is actually effective.

02:42.440 --> 02:45.400
How do you convert people to Linux in a way that sticks

02:45.400 --> 02:47.200
and is going to succeed?

02:47.200 --> 02:49.800
I think a lot of times in our community,

02:49.800 --> 02:54.040
we get so excited about Linux that we are a little pushy.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.820
And we try to convince certain people that

02:55.820 --> 02:58.080
might not be ideal candidates.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.880
So later on in the episode, I want

02:59.880 --> 03:03.040
to outline maybe who isn't ideal to run Linux,

03:03.040 --> 03:06.440
and the folks that are ideal, and how you can succeed

03:06.440 --> 03:08.280
in switching them to Linux.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.440
This is something that we've been talking about for weeks

03:10.440 --> 03:11.320
internally.

03:11.320 --> 03:12.440
It's not always easy, right?

03:12.440 --> 03:14.000
That's the thing is, it's complicated,

03:14.000 --> 03:17.520
and we're all blinded by our passions to some degree, right?

03:17.520 --> 03:18.200
Yeah.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.400
I do want people in my life to use Linux,

03:20.400 --> 03:21.800
but like anything else, you've got

03:21.800 --> 03:22.760
to think a little carefully about it.

03:22.760 --> 03:23.240
Yeah.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.520
I've got confessions to make later in the show.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.400
But before we go any further, we've

03:27.400 --> 03:30.160
got to bring in that Mumble Room Time appropriate greetings

03:30.160 --> 03:31.160
virtual lug.

03:31.160 --> 03:31.800
Hello.

03:31.800 --> 03:32.480
Hello, everyone.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.080
Hello.

03:34.080 --> 03:34.760
Well organized.

03:34.760 --> 03:35.240
Hello.

03:35.240 --> 03:35.920
I liked that.

03:35.920 --> 03:36.840
I liked that.

03:36.840 --> 03:41.000
And also, coming in in high fidelity remote studio quality

03:41.000 --> 03:42.480
cheese and Elle with us.

03:42.480 --> 03:43.240
Hello, guys.

03:43.240 --> 03:43.760
Hey.

03:43.760 --> 03:44.240
Hello.

03:44.240 --> 03:44.840
And Gal.

03:44.840 --> 03:45.680
Hi, there.

03:45.680 --> 03:48.320
So we have so much to start with.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.960
I'm very excited about the topics today

03:49.960 --> 03:54.400
because a lot of times we start getting on a topic,

03:54.400 --> 03:56.880
and I don't know, it just takes a while to go like,

03:56.880 --> 03:58.400
why don't we talk about this on air?

03:58.400 --> 03:59.960
Like, this is one of those weeks.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.880
So I'm pretty excited to get started.

04:01.880 --> 04:06.720
But I do want to start with some very, very, very good news.

04:06.720 --> 04:09.200
It's kind of fun to start with something sort of nice.

04:09.200 --> 04:12.800
I want to say a big happy birthday from the team here.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.200
Happy birthday.

04:14.200 --> 04:17.200
Woo!

04:17.200 --> 04:18.840
Yeah.

04:18.840 --> 04:21.960
We got some birthdays this week.

04:21.960 --> 04:24.760
First of all, big happy 21st birthday.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.800
You are now legal to drink in the US of A to curl.

04:27.800 --> 04:28.760
Oh, yeah.

04:28.760 --> 04:29.680
A wonderful curl.

04:29.680 --> 04:30.800
Everybody loves curl.

04:30.800 --> 04:31.320
Who doesn't?

04:31.320 --> 04:34.320
I mean, I literally use it, I think, every single day.

04:34.320 --> 04:38.040
Actually, 4 billion internet users, at least at one point,

04:38.040 --> 04:42.120
and 1.5 current installations per internet-connected human

04:42.120 --> 04:42.640
on Earth.

04:42.640 --> 04:43.960
I don't know how they know these numbers.

04:43.960 --> 04:47.080
Yeah, that is a question, some of these, perhaps.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.360
But they're all very impressive.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.800
669 persons have authored patches that have been merged.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.920
And that kind of just shows curl's hit the sweet spot.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.600
It's just such a useful utility.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.960
It's on the right layer of complexity and ease of use

04:58.960 --> 05:01.360
that you can write complex automated scripts.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.000
We're doing some of that with curl.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.720
Or you can just use it on the command line

05:04.720 --> 05:06.600
to download your favorite MP3 shows.

05:06.600 --> 05:07.280
Yeah, well said.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.120
It really is a tool.

05:09.120 --> 05:13.080
It's a perfect example of a Unix slash Linux staple.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.600
It's one of those staple utilities.

05:15.600 --> 05:19.760
And it now consists of 160,000 lines of code

05:19.760 --> 05:21.560
with over 24,000 commits.

05:21.560 --> 05:25.080
So it's an active project still, which is great.

05:25.080 --> 05:29.040
And 1,927 different persons have helped out so far

05:29.040 --> 05:29.760
over the years.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.480
See, I like that too, because they call it out separately.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.440
And you can see that the community is not just people

05:33.440 --> 05:34.600
getting patches merged, right?

05:34.600 --> 05:37.360
Like people writing tutorials, talking about it, evangelizing,

05:37.360 --> 05:38.680
or just filing bug reports.

05:38.680 --> 05:39.560
That all helps.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.440
You want to know a couple of nerdy stats?

05:41.440 --> 05:43.000
Yes, I do.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.800
OK, so 50 different build environments for curl

05:45.800 --> 05:49.800
are currently checked by their analyzer.

05:49.800 --> 05:54.960
And they are spending upwards of 20 to 25 CPU hours

05:54.960 --> 05:57.280
per commit checking it, per commit.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.600
Well, yeah, see, they are taking a lot of time

05:59.600 --> 06:00.440
to get that going.

06:00.440 --> 06:03.520
And it's impressive that that's a lot of build configurations.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.480
Yeah, and I guess they're going to have a party.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.400
There's going to be a party out there.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.520
I don't know.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.280
I feel like it's something we could do a little more of

06:10.280 --> 06:12.000
on the show is talk about these tools

06:12.000 --> 06:14.320
that we use even when we don't know we're using them.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.520
Like you might be using a package manager that's

06:16.520 --> 06:19.560
using curl in the background to pull down a package.

06:19.560 --> 06:22.360
Or maybe you're using YouTube DL and it's using curl.

06:22.360 --> 06:25.680
Or there's all kinds of different use cases for curl.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.760
So there's a lot of tools like that.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.720
Also, I want to take a moment, and it's not

06:30.720 --> 06:32.640
somebody that anybody listening to the show

06:32.640 --> 06:35.760
is directly familiar with, but a member of our Jupiter

06:35.760 --> 06:37.760
broadcasting community, Tyler, he's

06:37.760 --> 06:40.200
been with the community for over 10 years.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.160
It's his birthday today.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.000
And I just want to say happy birthday to Tyler.

06:43.000 --> 06:43.840
Happy birthday, Tyler.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.360
He's a great guy.

06:45.360 --> 06:46.920
Yeah, geez, you know Tyler.

06:46.920 --> 06:47.760
He's just a great guy.

06:47.760 --> 06:48.760
He's a wonderful guy.

06:48.760 --> 06:53.240
He's all about the JB community and has been

06:53.240 --> 06:55.240
and was really one of the first people

06:55.240 --> 06:57.920
that I interacted with whenever I joined the community myself.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.840
Yeah, and I guess I just want to take a little,

07:00.840 --> 07:03.080
I want to try to make a little more effort this year

07:03.080 --> 07:05.320
to thank the people that have been with us

07:05.320 --> 07:06.480
for a really long time.

07:06.480 --> 07:07.760
And I know there's a lot of you out there,

07:07.760 --> 07:08.960
and Tyler's just one of many.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.720
So thank you to all of you.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.720
To Tyler, happy birthday to Tyler.

07:13.720 --> 07:16.440
Also, by the way, Leonard Nimoy's birthday today.

07:16.440 --> 07:17.680
Oh, wonderful.

07:17.680 --> 07:19.440
The late-note Leonard Nimoy would have been,

07:19.440 --> 07:21.480
I believe, 88 today.

07:21.480 --> 07:24.400
Not that I'm a huge Star Trek fan or anything.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.760
Now can we talk about the most important news of the week?

07:26.760 --> 07:27.760
Are you good with this?

07:27.760 --> 07:29.320
I knew you would want to get here,

07:29.320 --> 07:30.760
and OK, let's get it over with.

07:30.760 --> 07:33.440
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure

07:33.440 --> 07:37.000
to announce that Nano 4.0 is released.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.440
Yes, GNU Nano 4.0, the Rope of Sands edition, is out.

07:42.440 --> 07:43.760
OK, that's a cool name.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.000
Never mind, I changed my mind.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.360
It is a super cool name.

07:48.360 --> 07:49.360
I got nothing.

07:49.360 --> 07:49.760
I got nothing.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.840
I think the biggest thing for me,

07:50.840 --> 07:52.320
and for what I've seen a lot of people talking about,

07:52.320 --> 07:55.600
is that first thing on the list here, an overlong line

07:55.600 --> 07:58.760
is no longer automatically hard wrapped.

07:58.760 --> 08:01.520
And that's just like, you might have a preference about that,

08:01.520 --> 08:04.760
but before, boom, just new lines injected into whatever

08:04.760 --> 08:05.760
you were looking at.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.800
And that's one of the reasons I never could use it.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.120
I just think it's funny that that's what you've noticed.

08:10.120 --> 08:14.000
What I noticed is smooth scrolling now one line at a time

08:14.000 --> 08:15.880
has become the default. That's what I noticed.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.280
See, OK, so there's some wheel rims.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.840
There's some real rims for everyone.

08:20.840 --> 08:24.400
So Wes now hosts the TechSnap program

08:24.400 --> 08:26.840
with Jim Salter, who's an author over at Ars Technica.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.080
And it's just really turned into a great production.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.080
And it means that I don't get a chance now

08:31.080 --> 08:32.820
to chat with you about some of these stories

08:32.820 --> 08:34.160
that we traditionally would have talked about.

08:34.160 --> 08:34.720
Yeah, that's true.

08:34.720 --> 08:36.340
So I wanted to get your opinion on what

08:36.340 --> 08:39.600
you think about this ASUS story this week, where hackers

08:39.600 --> 08:42.040
hijacked the ASUS software updates

08:42.040 --> 08:45.160
to install backdoors on thousands of Windows PCs.

08:45.160 --> 08:46.560
I mean, the obvious pitch here is

08:46.560 --> 08:48.060
this would never happen on Linux.

08:48.060 --> 08:51.560
But I just think this is an insane story.

08:51.560 --> 08:54.160
Researchers estimate that half a million Windows machines

08:54.160 --> 08:59.080
received the malicious backdoor through the ASUS update server,

08:59.080 --> 09:01.500
although the attackers appear to have been targeting maybe

09:01.500 --> 09:03.080
only 600 of those systems.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.840
Yeah, that's one of the weird aspects here.

09:04.840 --> 09:07.900
And Kaspersky first found this and has started writing up.

09:07.900 --> 09:08.940
And there will be.

09:08.940 --> 09:10.520
They're going to publish at a conference coming up

09:10.520 --> 09:11.580
a whole big breakdown.

09:11.580 --> 09:13.040
That's not out yet.

09:13.040 --> 09:16.480
But what researchers thought was weird, this is fairly clever.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.640
Basically, they've gotten some keys from ASUS,

09:19.640 --> 09:21.940
and then were able to have stuff that masqueraded

09:21.940 --> 09:24.400
as legitimate updates that would pass all those verification

09:24.400 --> 09:27.120
checks and just be installed on users' end machines.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.840
Once that was there and they'd planted that,

09:29.840 --> 09:32.200
then they specifically checked for MAC addresses

09:32.200 --> 09:34.360
on network cards like they'd pre-identified them.

09:34.360 --> 09:37.680
And only if they matched a set list did they then

09:37.680 --> 09:39.720
go phone home to a command and control server

09:39.720 --> 09:41.920
and install more software.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.920
All right, so this is fascinating.

09:44.920 --> 09:48.560
So Kaspersky Labs uncovered this attack back in January

09:48.560 --> 09:51.240
after adding a new supply chain to technology,

09:51.240 --> 09:53.080
like detection, that I guess is looking

09:53.080 --> 09:54.440
at machines in production.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.560
Yeah, I mean, supply chain attacks

09:56.560 --> 09:59.160
are becoming more common and are a big deal.

09:59.160 --> 10:02.480
So is this related to the buzzword I've heard

10:02.480 --> 10:03.560
thrown around, Shadowhammer?

10:03.560 --> 10:05.800
I've heard Shadowhammer a lot recently.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.400
How is Shadowhammer related to this?

10:07.400 --> 10:08.760
Yeah, that's what they're calling this.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.800
And I think it actually might also refer partially

10:10.800 --> 10:12.680
to some of the people behind it.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.760
Like the group name might be Shadowhammer?

10:14.760 --> 10:15.280
Interesting.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.320
Because some of the people involved

10:17.320 --> 10:20.080
or suspected threat actors here, there's

10:20.080 --> 10:22.080
been similar looking attacks in the past.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.880
So this is not entirely new.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.340
It is just sort of wide scale.

10:25.340 --> 10:27.800
And Kaspersky really wanted to publish it, obviously,

10:27.800 --> 10:30.320
because they've improved some fixes in their software.

10:30.320 --> 10:30.920
Yeah.

10:30.920 --> 10:34.840
And I think it highlights a major issue that

10:34.840 --> 10:38.440
is built into human beings, is we trust brands.

10:38.440 --> 10:40.040
And you see a brand name.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.080
It's a known vendor.

10:41.080 --> 10:44.600
It's an update coming from ASUS.

10:44.600 --> 10:45.740
And it's signed.

10:45.740 --> 10:47.800
Why wouldn't you think that's safe?

10:47.800 --> 10:52.600
And it kind of makes me want to eat a little bit of my hat.

10:52.600 --> 10:59.040
Because System76 recently announced a firmware update

10:59.040 --> 11:01.000
system that was based around the blockchain

11:01.000 --> 11:03.120
to validate if it was valid.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.880
And if the firmware update wasn't valid,

11:04.880 --> 11:06.840
it has a rollback mechanism.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.320
I kind of said, yeah, come on.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.160
Just use LVFS.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.600
So Emma is joining us.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.360
She's in the Mumble Room right now.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.280
And I think this is kind of interesting

11:16.280 --> 11:19.560
that you guys were looking at an update mechanism that sort of

11:19.560 --> 11:24.720
looks at if something is verifiably secure.

11:24.720 --> 11:28.120
Now, Emma, have you had issues with firmware updates?

11:28.120 --> 11:31.520
And has this been something that you guys have been considering

11:31.520 --> 11:32.440
could happen?

11:32.440 --> 11:35.920
I haven't had any issues or have customers report any issues.

11:35.920 --> 11:40.720
But I think the firmware is the lowest-level software

11:40.720 --> 11:42.400
that you can access.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.960
So it's important for that to be the most secure.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.960
Right, because it's doing things you're not even aware of.

11:47.960 --> 11:51.360
You have no idea what's going on there.

11:51.360 --> 11:55.080
And so I do like the idea of removing

11:55.080 --> 11:57.680
a little bit of the brand trust out of the picture.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.080
I mean, that's what it shows here, right?

12:00.080 --> 12:02.120
Even with cryptography, you can have

12:02.120 --> 12:04.720
stuff that helps you ensure that it was signed with the right key.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.520
But you're entirely reliant on that organization

12:07.520 --> 12:10.120
and basically what comes down to people and procedures

12:10.120 --> 12:12.840
to maintain the security of that key and really

12:12.840 --> 12:14.400
all the infrastructure in between.

12:14.400 --> 12:18.240
So at that side, if we don't use additional technology,

12:18.240 --> 12:21.120
this could happen to LVFS or any of our package repos.

12:21.120 --> 12:24.240
I was going to ask if you think LVFS could be susceptible

12:24.240 --> 12:25.480
to something like this.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.960
I'm sure Richard Hughes would argue that there

12:27.960 --> 12:31.040
is some precautions in place.

12:31.040 --> 12:33.120
And that's where it can be a mixed bag between,

12:33.120 --> 12:34.960
do you rely on centralization so that you

12:34.960 --> 12:37.760
can have more resources dedicated to distributing

12:37.760 --> 12:39.440
firmware from many sources?

12:39.440 --> 12:42.320
Or do you go another route where you want multiple options

12:42.320 --> 12:44.080
so that if that is compromised, well,

12:44.080 --> 12:46.800
system 76, for instance, wouldn't be affected?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.840
My understanding, too, is that this isn't necessarily

12:48.840 --> 12:52.160
completely solved because ASUS still hasn't invalidated two

12:52.160 --> 12:55.160
of the compromised certificates, which means the attackers,

12:55.160 --> 12:59.440
or I suppose anyone else really that figures this out,

12:59.440 --> 13:01.360
could potentially still abuse this.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.880
Yes, which is kind of unfortunate.

13:03.880 --> 13:05.680
They stole two certificates, it looks like,

13:05.680 --> 13:07.240
one that expired last year, and then there

13:07.240 --> 13:08.240
was still one valid one.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.320
And so far, that hasn't been invalidated.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.600
So I don't know why ASUS is kind of dropping the ball there.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.040
It must be because it's going to break something.

13:15.040 --> 13:17.560
Yeah, probably there's a process they need to go to do,

13:17.560 --> 13:19.680
update, get new keys that they can trust in their system

13:19.680 --> 13:21.040
before they can invalidate that one.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.560
I imagine they're relying on it.

13:22.560 --> 13:26.480
Man, the Windows ecosystem is such a hot mess.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.600
Wow.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.480
It's so gross with all these different updaters.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.520
When you get a Windows machine out of the box,

13:32.520 --> 13:35.600
there's three or four different installation interfaces,

13:35.600 --> 13:38.200
install wizards, and MSI installers,

13:38.200 --> 13:39.640
and custom written installers.

13:39.640 --> 13:42.360
And then there's the vendor's driver updates and firmware

13:42.360 --> 13:44.440
updates, and then the Intel updates.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.440
There's like Windows updates.

13:46.440 --> 13:49.480
The culture makes you accept those things as normal.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.840
You know, I think Elle often says that Linux

13:52.840 --> 13:54.400
has too many repositories.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.360
She'll often say, like, every time the solution

13:56.360 --> 13:57.520
is add another repository.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.800
But then I think about that situation on Windows,

13:59.800 --> 14:02.160
and I think, I don't know if I'd like that any better.

14:02.160 --> 14:02.680
No.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.800
No.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.640
Wow, ASUS.

14:05.640 --> 14:06.800
So we're all getting Macs?

14:06.800 --> 14:08.600
Is that what you're saying?

14:08.600 --> 14:10.280
Yeah, and then we'll get no updates.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.280
I mean, then we're really trusting the manufacturer

14:12.280 --> 14:13.280
with their keys baked in.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.160
Yeah, as long as you're good with a driver from four years

14:15.160 --> 14:19.000
ago for your video card, then you're set.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.680
All right, well, I guess we can move on.

14:20.680 --> 14:23.160
But I just thought that was a fascinating story

14:23.160 --> 14:24.480
that Windows users.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.720
Also, just as like a slight PSA, if you have any reason

14:27.720 --> 14:29.640
to think you're one of those 600 people that

14:29.640 --> 14:31.960
may have been targeted, they do have a little website

14:31.960 --> 14:33.360
that we'll have linked where you can go enter your Mac

14:33.360 --> 14:34.400
and check.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.360
I was chatting with somebody that works at Linux Academy who

14:37.360 --> 14:41.080
runs Linux as their main desktop but has an ASUS system running

14:41.080 --> 14:43.160
Windows for gaming.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.040
And he's like, I'm not so sure.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.000
I might be one of these.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
So yeah, it could be you.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.400
It could be, because you just never know.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.240
Anyways, so there's a distribution.

14:55.240 --> 14:57.560
I'm not going to go with the vernacular the media is using.

14:57.560 --> 15:01.080
There's a distribution out there these days that

15:01.080 --> 15:03.680
is causing a bit of controversy, and it's

15:03.680 --> 15:07.760
called SIGINT OS, Signals Intelligent OS.

15:07.760 --> 15:11.520
Signals intelligence would be sort of like a spy trade

15:11.520 --> 15:14.760
craft term for intelligence about communications.

15:14.760 --> 15:17.960
And SIGINT OS is an Ubuntu-based distribution

15:17.960 --> 15:21.640
with a number of built-in intelligence applications

15:21.640 --> 15:24.560
for software-defined radios, amongst a bunch

15:24.560 --> 15:25.680
of other things.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.440
Yeah, that's kind of what's interesting is,

15:27.440 --> 15:29.960
by all accounts, it seems to be very well executed,

15:29.960 --> 15:32.680
a built-in GUI that grants easy access to just

15:32.680 --> 15:34.400
all the common tools that they've got ahead

15:34.400 --> 15:37.880
and installed for you, things like an FM and GPS transmitter,

15:37.880 --> 15:40.920
a jammer, a GSM base station search tool,

15:40.920 --> 15:43.000
and an IMS eye catcher.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.960
Now, that sounds interesting.

15:45.960 --> 15:49.480
So it's a competitor to Kali, but it's focusing right there.

15:49.480 --> 15:52.840
What you just talked about is cellular technology and GPS

15:52.840 --> 15:54.040
technology.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.040
Yeah, right, and then that's kind of interesting.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.580
They've targeted this specific thing.

15:57.580 --> 16:01.960
It also has teased an LTE search and LTE decoder tool,

16:01.960 --> 16:04.240
which that could be very interesting.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.600
We've seen more and more flaws in those cellular protocols

16:06.600 --> 16:07.720
over the years.

16:07.720 --> 16:11.040
Yeah, I'm not quite clear on if you can just

16:11.040 --> 16:14.520
download this distro and start scanning for LTE devices

16:14.520 --> 16:16.160
if you have LTE equipment.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.560
It sounds like you need a license

16:17.560 --> 16:19.400
from the distribution provider.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.240
Oh, interesting.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.020
Yeah, I mean, when you get into some of these things,

16:22.020 --> 16:23.640
there are various legal requirements,

16:23.640 --> 16:25.820
so I could see why they might be worried about that.

16:25.820 --> 16:28.120
And we've got to say, like you said,

16:28.120 --> 16:30.520
there was some controversy and such.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.120
It's always going to bring up the debate around tools

16:33.120 --> 16:35.000
can be used for good and for bad.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.580
So if you're a legitimate researcher,

16:36.580 --> 16:39.080
we should be probing for security in these products.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.040
You could also abuse it.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.840
The other way to put that, too, because you're right,

16:41.840 --> 16:43.640
and the other way to think about that

16:43.640 --> 16:46.080
is where is the line of enablement?

16:46.080 --> 16:48.560
Where are you enabling casual people

16:48.560 --> 16:53.120
to abuse systems versus empowering administrators

16:53.120 --> 16:55.840
to check their own systems or people that

16:55.840 --> 16:57.480
are doing penetration testing?

16:57.480 --> 17:01.080
And this distribution, I think, kind of walks that line.

17:01.080 --> 17:06.080
It's a two gigabit, two gigabit, like I feel like the oldest

17:06.080 --> 17:09.320
person in the room when I do gigabytes versus megabytes.

17:09.320 --> 17:14.440
It's a two gigabyte ISO file, which is, to me,

17:14.440 --> 17:15.600
even still seems like a lot.

17:15.600 --> 17:18.200
I appreciate that it's not now, but to me, it does.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.660
I mean, it's still kind of a lot.

17:19.660 --> 17:22.000
I just remember trying to fit them on CDs, you know?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.480
And you don't want to download that on mobile.

17:24.480 --> 17:27.120
Or dial-up.

17:27.120 --> 17:28.920
The thing where I kind of feel like they maybe

17:28.920 --> 17:31.400
crossed the line is this GUI that they

17:31.400 --> 17:36.240
include to find LTE base stations and the IME

17:36.240 --> 17:38.120
numbers of phones.

17:38.120 --> 17:42.840
That isn't necessarily a bad thing,

17:42.840 --> 17:45.960
but what's the practical use case for that?

17:45.960 --> 17:49.200
When do you need to survey LTE stations

17:49.200 --> 17:51.080
and try to collect the identification

17:51.080 --> 17:52.840
numbers of phones?

17:52.840 --> 17:55.360
That's fair, although the part that gets me about it

17:55.360 --> 17:58.600
is, especially for wireless things,

17:58.600 --> 18:03.320
those are just signals passing through you and your device.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.960
It's another network signal.

18:05.960 --> 18:09.320
And you can record it, and then you can just.

18:09.320 --> 18:12.260
Now, where the line gets more gray, in my opinion,

18:12.260 --> 18:14.440
is when you start actively communicating back

18:14.440 --> 18:15.680
and interacting with the system.

18:15.680 --> 18:19.280
Acting as a base station, injecting false information,

18:19.280 --> 18:21.360
or even just recording private information.

18:21.360 --> 18:23.200
Hm.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.400
That's a, yeah, that's.

18:24.400 --> 18:27.480
Right, like you can record an FM station for personal play

18:27.480 --> 18:29.640
mate, because that's how you play the thing

18:29.640 --> 18:30.800
in the first place.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.560
Also, just a mention here that it's still

18:33.560 --> 18:36.200
using Unity 7 for the desktop on this distro.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.280
I just think that's great.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.480
I mean, we're going to come back to this,

18:38.480 --> 18:40.320
but it's a practical tool, I guess.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.600
I like how it also, it's all wrapped up

18:42.600 --> 18:46.520
in this beautiful little GUI.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.320
But I'm pretty sure the FCC would have

18:48.320 --> 18:50.440
some problems with Jammer.

18:50.440 --> 18:51.480
That's what I'm thinking.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.520
You know, some of these tools, I think

18:53.520 --> 18:56.200
it's maybe a little too far.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.640
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.140
It's probably pushing it, especially

18:59.140 --> 19:01.060
when it comes to the cellular network stuff.

19:01.060 --> 19:02.120
That's crossing a line.

19:02.120 --> 19:04.640
But to Wes's point, I kind of feel

19:04.640 --> 19:08.560
like this is becoming more and more the standard way

19:08.560 --> 19:09.960
we network.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.660
Cellular networking is becoming the way more and more people

19:12.660 --> 19:13.280
are connected.

19:13.280 --> 19:16.440
Yes, it's become almost an important public utility,

19:16.440 --> 19:18.360
in a sense, even though it's not treated that way.

19:18.360 --> 19:21.240
And we should, I think in particular,

19:21.240 --> 19:22.680
there has been a dearth of testing.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.880
These have been very proprietary and controlled

19:24.880 --> 19:27.440
because there's only a couple main players that have access

19:27.440 --> 19:29.120
and either make or use the tech.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.560
So I would like to see more research done.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.980
That doesn't mean I want people jamming my cell phone, which

19:33.980 --> 19:35.600
is exactly what I do not want.

19:35.600 --> 19:38.720
I know, because that's really going to be annoying.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.680
If that becomes commonplace, well, what we're going to see

19:41.680 --> 19:43.560
is an arms race, and the cellular carriers

19:43.560 --> 19:45.560
will have to be able to innovate and update

19:45.560 --> 19:49.580
their networks at a way faster pace than they do now.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.280
But maybe this is the kind of thing

19:51.280 --> 19:53.400
that will force that to happen.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.040
6G, here we go.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.600
Yeah, forget 5G.

19:56.600 --> 20:01.080
Well, who wouldn't want to jam someone

20:01.080 --> 20:03.600
that's on their phone and stuck in traffic or something

20:03.600 --> 20:05.120
like that, right?

20:05.120 --> 20:06.960
That's just burning up your time.

20:06.960 --> 20:10.240
And so let me just jam the entire freeway.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.760
I suppose there's also an opportunity for encryption

20:12.760 --> 20:14.040
to succeed here, Brent.

20:14.040 --> 20:17.280
Yeah, it feels to me like when you open up

20:17.280 --> 20:18.800
some of these networks to some testing

20:18.800 --> 20:21.440
from some white hat hackers, then it

20:21.440 --> 20:24.360
may push the envelope a little bit,

20:24.360 --> 20:27.200
because some of these networks have been in sync for a long time.

20:27.200 --> 20:30.360
And so I would love to see encryption a little bit

20:30.360 --> 20:31.960
everywhere for everybody's benefit.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.800
And you're seeing that a little bit more

20:33.800 --> 20:37.040
with encrypted messengers and stuff on our cell phones.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.480
So why can't the cell networks be better than they are?

20:39.480 --> 20:40.840
The technology seems to be there.

20:40.840 --> 20:41.340
Yeah.

20:41.340 --> 20:45.360
I could see if screwing around with the cell networks

20:45.360 --> 20:49.200
becomes more accessible, it could force their hand.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.000
But the short-term result would be

20:52.000 --> 20:53.960
it is people that are pranking you,

20:53.960 --> 20:56.240
like you go to a group event and all the cells get jammed

20:56.240 --> 20:57.520
and nobody has any data.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.800
Ha, ha, millennials can't use Instagram.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.120
That's how it'll be justified.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.480
But the reality is that's actually

21:02.480 --> 21:04.900
a very important communications tool.

21:04.900 --> 21:07.000
So there will be short-term losses.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.740
But long-term, you're going to force the cellular networks

21:09.740 --> 21:10.640
to react.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.760
I think the other thing that I can't actually speak to,

21:12.760 --> 21:17.400
but we should think about is how does it affect the landscape?

21:17.400 --> 21:19.800
What other tools exist that have similar capabilities?

21:19.800 --> 21:21.880
So if you are even a little bit motivated in the prankster

21:21.880 --> 21:24.280
mindset, is this unique in making it easy for you

21:24.280 --> 21:24.760
to do this?

21:24.760 --> 21:27.360
Or is it just better executed for professionals

21:27.360 --> 21:28.200
that want to use it?

21:28.200 --> 21:28.960
And I don't know.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.040
I don't use these tools personally, so I can't say.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.420
This is an area that I haven't messed around with.

21:33.420 --> 21:36.040
Kali Linux and going after network systems.

21:36.040 --> 21:39.460
In fact, I spent some time about a solid year and a half,

21:39.460 --> 21:41.360
really, because for six months, it

21:41.360 --> 21:42.600
was sort of like trying it out.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.400
But for a solid year, I did contracting

21:44.400 --> 21:45.960
as a penetration tester.

21:45.960 --> 21:50.120
And one of the absolute most enjoyable things I did really

21:50.120 --> 21:54.400
was so much fun to drop a text file on a Windows server

21:54.400 --> 21:58.320
desktop saying, I've owned you, or get access to.

21:58.320 --> 22:01.640
Man, I remember the time that I found the FTP server

22:01.640 --> 22:04.560
that the clinics, like they have one

22:04.560 --> 22:06.760
of these big multi-function printer

22:06.760 --> 22:09.800
fact scanner huge units from Xerox that you get

22:09.800 --> 22:10.920
a monthly price.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.880
And Xerox is just kind of hangs out

22:12.880 --> 22:14.040
because it's always broken.

22:14.040 --> 22:18.560
And it was FTPing the images of client records

22:18.560 --> 22:21.400
to a server with no password.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.200
Plain text FTP, no password.

22:23.200 --> 22:23.920
This is great.

22:23.920 --> 22:27.440
And by hiring me, I was able to sort of outline

22:27.440 --> 22:28.440
these issues to them.

22:28.440 --> 22:32.200
And they were able to get them fixed up before anybody

22:32.200 --> 22:33.220
actually exploited that.

22:33.220 --> 22:35.640
And I was using things like Kali Linux.

22:35.640 --> 22:38.960
I don't remember Kali Linux's.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.640
It wasn't always called Kali back then.

22:40.640 --> 22:41.800
It was called something else.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.560
Do you remember what it was called?

22:43.560 --> 22:44.760
There was another name for Kali.

22:44.760 --> 22:46.300
And in the project, there was a change.

22:46.300 --> 22:47.680
But I used it for ages.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.680
And that's a very valuable tool.

22:49.680 --> 22:52.280
And we will see where this goes.

22:52.280 --> 22:56.160
Siginsos is kind of a fun name, too.

22:56.160 --> 22:56.680
All right.

22:56.680 --> 22:59.960
There is some really important stuff we need to cover.

22:59.960 --> 23:01.920
A lot in housekeeping this week.

23:01.920 --> 23:04.120
I want to start by saying, if you're looking for work

23:04.120 --> 23:07.640
and you are a Ruby on Rails developer,

23:07.640 --> 23:09.560
or maybe you love yourself some Angular,

23:09.560 --> 23:11.560
or you're willing to learn some Angular,

23:11.560 --> 23:14.440
Linux Academy is hiring right now for several positions.

23:14.440 --> 23:18.060
Remote, full time, full benefits.

23:18.060 --> 23:20.320
It's a great company to work for, linuxacademy.com

23:20.320 --> 23:21.560
slash careers.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.960
If you are a Ruby on Rails developer,

23:23.960 --> 23:27.360
or an Angular guy or gal that wants

23:27.360 --> 23:31.440
to be involved in developing future additions to Linux

23:31.440 --> 23:32.440
Academy platform.

23:32.440 --> 23:32.640
Yeah.

23:32.640 --> 23:33.240
I mean, that's it, right?

23:33.240 --> 23:35.920
Like, come aboard, help make the platform better,

23:35.920 --> 23:38.000
and everything gets better.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.440
You get to directly help train more Linux users, which

23:40.440 --> 23:42.360
is one of my favorite things about the job.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.800
linuxacademy.com slash careers.

23:44.800 --> 23:48.680
I would really encourage you, if you're thinking about a change,

23:48.680 --> 23:49.300
do it.

23:49.300 --> 23:49.800
Do it.

23:49.800 --> 23:52.480
Because first of all, there are so many great things

23:52.480 --> 23:55.400
about remote work.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.440
Not to make housekeeping super long,

23:57.440 --> 23:59.840
but cheese just recently transitioned

23:59.840 --> 24:02.160
to working from home.

24:02.160 --> 24:05.840
And I'm curious, cheese, does it feel like freedom?

24:05.840 --> 24:06.720
What is it?

24:06.720 --> 24:09.000
If you could sum it up just really briefly.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.320
Yeah, really briefly.

24:10.320 --> 24:13.560
I mean, it's different.

24:13.560 --> 24:15.760
I quickly learned that my dogs do not

24:15.760 --> 24:20.280
observe daylight savings time, that one of my dogs

24:20.280 --> 24:23.920
get aggravated if I change it from Judge Judy.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.960
One of my dogs gets really upset about that.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.280
That's a complicated dog, man.

24:27.280 --> 24:31.560
Yeah, they don't have a concept of work time versus play time.

24:31.560 --> 24:33.320
How's the commute now?

24:33.320 --> 24:34.520
The commute is wonderful.

24:34.520 --> 24:36.880
It's about 10 feet.

24:36.880 --> 24:40.440
But I do go through a regular get dressed,

24:40.440 --> 24:43.200
put on regular clothes, as if I'm going

24:43.200 --> 24:46.760
to go into an office somewhere.

24:46.760 --> 24:50.160
It is a little different whenever you're time off,

24:50.160 --> 24:53.680
because your house is still where you work.

24:53.680 --> 24:54.560
But it's cool.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.240
I have an opportunity to go to the beach.

24:56.240 --> 24:57.920
And I did that this past weekend just

24:57.920 --> 24:59.640
to disconnect from everything.

24:59.640 --> 25:00.440
And it was great.

25:00.440 --> 25:03.720
You know what I find that I've only started doing,

25:03.720 --> 25:06.880
even just recently, and I know you do this,

25:06.880 --> 25:09.440
is going somewhere to work.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.000
Oh, yeah.

25:10.000 --> 25:14.680
Like a restaurant or a coffee shop or something like this.

25:14.680 --> 25:18.640
I always thought that was such a MacBook using, coffee drinking.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.280
But it actually is.

25:20.280 --> 25:22.560
There's an energy you get by the people working around you.

25:22.560 --> 25:26.320
I know that sounds weird, but you're around other people.

25:26.320 --> 25:27.640
It's a change in pace.

25:27.640 --> 25:28.680
And then at some point, you probably

25:28.680 --> 25:30.880
want to go home, which can be a nice stimulus to just be

25:30.880 --> 25:31.800
productive and wrap up.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.360
You're like, OK, well, I came here to get this work done.

25:33.360 --> 25:34.800
You kind of get your work done.

25:34.800 --> 25:37.520
And then you can have a nice walk home, decompress.

25:37.520 --> 25:41.440
Yes, and I'll go do XYZ at the coffee shop.

25:41.440 --> 25:43.280
And then when I get back to the studio,

25:43.280 --> 25:44.240
I'm going to work on this.

25:44.240 --> 25:45.440
I separate it up that way, too.

25:45.440 --> 25:48.080
So I think it's gotten me more active in my local community,

25:48.080 --> 25:49.960
because it's not coming home from work

25:49.960 --> 25:51.480
and then dreading going back out.

25:51.480 --> 25:54.680
I actually get excited about going and seeing other people.

25:54.680 --> 25:57.640
So I've become a lot more active in the meetups near me.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.560
Interesting.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.120
I can kind of see that, too.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.840
That is one of the other things you have to be wary of, right?

26:03.840 --> 26:05.160
You don't have an office anymore.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.480
It's just you at your home.

26:06.480 --> 26:08.600
You know, what I have found, too,

26:08.600 --> 26:11.760
is I will get a different kind of work done

26:11.760 --> 26:13.680
when I'm in office, like down at Linux Academy

26:13.680 --> 26:15.320
versus back here at the studio.

26:15.320 --> 26:17.160
Both good, just different.

26:17.160 --> 26:17.960
That's interesting.

26:17.960 --> 26:19.720
Just different kinds of work.

26:19.720 --> 26:22.000
Anyways, let's keep going, because I was

26:22.000 --> 26:23.680
going to try to make this brief.

26:23.680 --> 26:26.920
If you are thinking about going to Linux Fest Northwest,

26:26.920 --> 26:27.640
and you should be.

26:27.640 --> 26:31.720
You have until the 31st, I think it is, of this month?

26:31.720 --> 26:32.840
Yes, the end of this month.

26:32.840 --> 26:33.320
OK.

26:33.320 --> 26:33.920
May.

26:33.920 --> 26:34.280
March.

26:34.280 --> 26:35.160
March.

26:35.160 --> 26:35.880
We're a mess.

26:35.880 --> 26:37.000
I'm going to confuse it, yeah.

26:37.000 --> 26:37.800
The end of this month.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.640
It's March 31st.

26:39.640 --> 26:44.480
If you want to do a fancy sponsored Linux Fest Northwest

26:44.480 --> 26:46.560
shirt, like you want to help out the fest

26:46.560 --> 26:50.640
and get a fancy shirt out of it, they've got an $80 shirt.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.080
I know it seems like a lot, but it's

26:52.080 --> 26:55.520
because you're kind of contributing to Linux Fest,

26:55.520 --> 26:59.360
which is a completely 100% lug run event.

26:59.360 --> 27:01.200
The Bellingham Linux Users Group is

27:01.200 --> 27:02.800
what puts Linux Fest together, right?

27:02.800 --> 27:04.560
It's not a foundation.

27:04.560 --> 27:06.040
It's not a corporation.

27:06.040 --> 27:09.240
It's not a group of companies in the Pacific Northwest.

27:09.240 --> 27:11.640
It is the guys at the Bellingham Linux.

27:11.640 --> 27:13.320
And you're not making anyone a red chair.

27:13.320 --> 27:15.120
You're just helping make the conference a little bit better.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.000
Yeah.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.600
So we'll have a link in the show notes,

27:18.600 --> 27:20.600
because it's kind of like first come, first serve.

27:20.600 --> 27:21.840
And it looks like they're going to have

27:21.840 --> 27:23.000
a cool design for it, too.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.400
So I just want to give them a mention,

27:24.400 --> 27:26.160
because I think it'd be kind of cool if you're thinking

27:26.160 --> 27:28.360
about going, or you just love the idea of something

27:28.360 --> 27:29.480
like that.

27:29.480 --> 27:33.120
And then obviously, I need to remind everybody

27:33.120 --> 27:36.600
that Ansible is a thing, and that we will have a study group

27:36.600 --> 27:38.800
on Ansible next week.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.400
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting

27:41.400 --> 27:43.800
for details on that.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.360
And I'm happy to say it's going to be hosted

27:46.360 --> 27:49.040
by our very own L and Wes Payne.

27:49.040 --> 27:49.840
Hey, that's us.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.240
That is you guys.

27:51.240 --> 27:55.280
And I think that's going to be great, because first of all,

27:55.280 --> 27:56.640
I know you're a great presenter.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.600
And second of all, I know you have a lot of hands

27:58.600 --> 28:00.040
on with this kind of stuff.

28:00.040 --> 28:03.120
And so if you want to learn a little more about Ansible,

28:03.120 --> 28:04.240
we'll have the time and date.

28:04.240 --> 28:09.080
It's 1 o'clock our time, which is before Linux Unplugged.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.160
Before Linux Unplugged.

28:10.160 --> 28:14.000
We're trying it at a different time, before the show.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.560
And we'll learn some stuff about Ansible.

28:16.560 --> 28:19.760
And then we can unwind with an excellent little Linux

28:19.760 --> 28:20.280
Unplugged.

28:20.280 --> 28:21.080
Absolutely.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.600
And I want to put an invite out there

28:22.600 --> 28:26.520
to anybody who is experienced with Ansible or a bit

28:26.520 --> 28:28.600
of an Ansible pro.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.320
Please consider joining our Mumble Room

28:30.320 --> 28:31.520
and help answering questions.

28:31.520 --> 28:33.760
Because we'd like to answer a lot of questions.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.720
There is our early indicators that this

28:36.720 --> 28:38.920
is a topic that people are pretty interested in.

28:38.920 --> 28:41.640
And we've got 50 people already signed up for the meetup.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.600
And I think it's something that people are trying

28:43.600 --> 28:44.560
to wrap their heads around.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.840
And we really want to help the community learn and figure

28:46.840 --> 28:47.440
this stuff out.

28:47.440 --> 28:50.120
It's like we've expanded from being a virtual Lug

28:50.120 --> 28:52.400
to now we have like a virtual Birds of a Feather session.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.320
So it's just going to be a place to talk about and learn

28:55.320 --> 28:55.800
Ansible.

28:55.800 --> 28:56.560
That's exactly it.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.840
That is exactly it.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.680
The virtual, and a lot of times Lugs

28:59.680 --> 29:01.520
will have people come in and present stuff.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.400
And it's just, it's expanding that.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.480
And it's expanding that.

29:04.480 --> 29:06.960
And calling it a virtual Birds of a Feather session

29:06.960 --> 29:11.240
is actually, that's a pretty good way to describe it.

29:11.240 --> 29:14.440
And down the road, as we kind of figure this out,

29:14.440 --> 29:17.120
I could absolutely see us opening this kind of thing

29:17.120 --> 29:19.160
up to community contributors that

29:19.160 --> 29:22.160
would like to cover a topic that they're an expert on.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.160
It's not just limited to Linux Academy, Training Architects,

29:25.160 --> 29:26.360
or Westpane.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.080
We're going to open up to the community.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.800
We're just kind of getting familiar with how to do this.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.040
And I think this study group is going to be a good one.

29:33.040 --> 29:36.960
The Ansible Fundamental Study Group, next Tuesday,

29:36.960 --> 29:39.480
one hour before our regular Linux Unplugged Lifetime.

29:39.480 --> 29:41.000
That's 1 PM Pacific.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.840
Of course, we have all the details at meetup.com

29:42.840 --> 29:45.760
slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

29:45.760 --> 29:47.060
That's going to be pretty cool.

29:47.060 --> 29:48.560
I think that's going to be a good one.

29:48.560 --> 29:49.720
I'm looking forward to it.

29:49.720 --> 29:53.640
Now, I also want to mention that DebConf 19 is

29:53.640 --> 29:55.300
making a call for proposals.

29:55.300 --> 29:58.000
If you'd like to present a DebConf this year,

29:58.000 --> 29:59.520
well, now is the time.

29:59.520 --> 30:01.680
It's from July 14th and 19th.

30:01.680 --> 30:03.220
So go get that submitted.

30:03.220 --> 30:06.320
We will have a link in the show notes for DebConf stuff.

30:06.320 --> 30:07.840
Oh, wouldn't that be neat?

30:07.840 --> 30:10.200
You've got a cool event coming up, it sounds like, too.

30:10.200 --> 30:10.880
Oh, yeah.

30:10.880 --> 30:11.960
In May, I think it is.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.880
It is in May, yeah.

30:13.880 --> 30:14.400
What is it?

30:14.400 --> 30:15.480
I guess we should probably tell people.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.080
I mean, why not?

30:16.080 --> 30:17.280
If they're going to be there, they

30:17.280 --> 30:18.480
can come say hi to you and L. L.

30:18.480 --> 30:21.520
Do you remember the details on is it Kubicon and when it is?

30:21.520 --> 30:25.040
May 20th through 24th in Barcelona, Spain.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.200
Boom.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.320
How about that, an event in Barcelona, Spain.

30:28.320 --> 30:31.120
Come say hi to Wes and L. What a lovely place to have an event.

30:31.120 --> 30:32.720
I'll be here holding down.

30:32.720 --> 30:34.400
This is weird to sit one out.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.040
Yeah, that is weird.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.240
Never really done that before.

30:36.240 --> 30:39.520
Hey, if anyone finds us, I want to go on another ghost tour.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.680
So I will organize that.

30:41.680 --> 30:44.200
Just ping me, and I will get that happening.

30:44.200 --> 30:47.120
Awesome, a ghost tour in Spain.

30:47.120 --> 30:49.160
Wow, that would really be next level, actually.

30:49.160 --> 30:49.960
I love that.

30:49.960 --> 30:50.760
So there you go.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.360
Details in the show notes, if you

30:52.360 --> 30:55.120
want to know more, which is in your podcast player of choice

30:55.120 --> 31:00.840
or over at linuxunplugged.com slash 294.

31:00.840 --> 31:04.080
Now, I wanted to cover a couple of things in the show

31:04.080 --> 31:07.320
that I feel like maybe people have run into that we've never

31:07.320 --> 31:08.320
talked about.

31:08.320 --> 31:14.040
Because to be honest, we have a bit of a bias on this show.

31:14.040 --> 31:17.400
And there's just no way around it.

31:17.400 --> 31:22.000
We've all been using desktop Linux for years now.

31:22.000 --> 31:28.240
And I didn't think it stopped me from recognizing

31:28.240 --> 31:32.240
deficiencies or where desktop Linux wasn't super strong.

31:32.240 --> 31:37.560
But I got to say, with Jason Evangelo from Choose Linux

31:37.560 --> 31:41.320
doing this challenge, this distro challenge,

31:41.320 --> 31:43.280
and working closely with Elle as she tries out

31:43.280 --> 31:44.680
the different distributions.

31:44.680 --> 31:49.120
And both of them are completely technical.

31:49.120 --> 31:52.560
Both of them are very familiar with operating systems.

31:52.560 --> 31:53.840
Competent debuggers.

31:53.840 --> 31:58.400
Yeah, and just to watch the different kind of issues

31:58.400 --> 31:59.640
they've run into.

31:59.640 --> 32:02.600
It's kind of been like little, oh, yeah, mm, right.

32:02.600 --> 32:03.840
It's been a lot of that.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.280
It's been a lot of like, oh, yeah, that's right.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.200
That's just something I've learned to avoid.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.080
Mm, oh, yeah, that problem.

32:09.080 --> 32:11.200
Yeah, I just put an Intel card in.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.640
Now that's what I do, oh, yeah.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.440
Oh, for that, yeah, if I'm going to have more than three

32:14.440 --> 32:16.000
monitors, I just do it on a desktop.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.320
Yeah, these are all the things I've

32:18.320 --> 32:22.880
internalized that I just sort of forgive Linux for now.

32:22.880 --> 32:25.800
And I'm watching it from fresh perspectives

32:25.800 --> 32:27.240
and from fresh eyes.

32:27.240 --> 32:30.720
And one of the more interesting ones,

32:30.720 --> 32:32.960
one of the more interesting issues that cropped up

32:32.960 --> 32:35.120
was Elle's tainted kernel.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.440
And I honestly hadn't heard of this.

32:38.440 --> 32:40.600
And I'm imagining, I'm just picturing it, Elle.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.440
You're sitting there looking at your logs,

32:42.440 --> 32:44.080
trying to debug what was going on.

32:44.080 --> 32:45.440
I mean, there must have been some issue

32:45.440 --> 32:46.840
you were trying to solve.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.360
And then you see tainted kernel.

32:48.360 --> 32:49.600
Take me through what happened.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.920
Why were you debugging?

32:51.920 --> 32:54.200
And what was the experience going through the logs

32:54.200 --> 32:54.960
and seeing that?

32:54.960 --> 32:57.160
So I'd love to tell you that I was actually

32:57.160 --> 32:58.480
debugging at the time.

32:58.480 --> 33:01.240
But all I did was open the lid to my computer.

33:01.240 --> 33:04.080
I log in, and suddenly I've got this pop-up telling me

33:04.080 --> 33:05.840
that my kernel is tainted.

33:05.840 --> 33:08.680
No additional information, no click here for more.

33:08.680 --> 33:10.920
Like a GNOME notification came down

33:10.920 --> 33:13.160
saying you have a tainted kernel, like a desktop

33:13.160 --> 33:13.880
notification?

33:13.880 --> 33:15.920
A system alert.

33:15.920 --> 33:16.560
Wow.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.480
Yeah, so I'm like, OK.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.760
So I start looking in logs, and I'm

33:20.760 --> 33:23.840
trying to grep the word tainted out of system logs,

33:23.840 --> 33:26.160
and I can't find anything.

33:26.160 --> 33:27.760
So I'm thinking maybe I'm just not

33:27.760 --> 33:28.960
looking in the right place.

33:28.960 --> 33:30.280
I'm looking at journal CTL.

33:30.280 --> 33:33.800
I keep missing my old VAR log messages so badly

33:33.800 --> 33:34.720
in that moment.

33:34.720 --> 33:35.440
Oh, I know.

33:35.440 --> 33:35.940
I know.

33:35.940 --> 33:36.920
That is the one thing.

33:36.920 --> 33:39.080
I miss VAR log messages so much.

33:39.080 --> 33:42.680
For clarification, it's Fedora, right?

33:42.680 --> 33:43.680
And in what version?

33:43.680 --> 33:44.920
Fedora 29.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.480
And I was following Jason's challenge,

33:47.480 --> 33:48.840
so we were running GNOME for GNOME.

33:48.840 --> 33:49.520
Right, of course.

33:49.520 --> 33:51.320
I believe it was a 4.20 kernel.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.200
Yeah, OK.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.680
So yeah, I get in there, and I'm looking at logs.

33:54.680 --> 33:56.680
And since I can't find anything, I

33:56.680 --> 33:59.960
do what I hopefully every other admin does, and I go to Google.

33:59.960 --> 34:02.160
I'm about three pages in, and I can't

34:02.160 --> 34:04.760
find any official documentation.

34:04.760 --> 34:06.960
So then I start looking at just forums,

34:06.960 --> 34:09.480
and I narrow it down to either I've

34:09.480 --> 34:14.640
installed proprietary drivers, which I haven't made a change,

34:14.640 --> 34:17.720
or my system is completely hosed, and I've been owned.

34:17.720 --> 34:19.360
There was no in-between ground.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.080
Wow.

34:20.080 --> 34:23.960
And just to clarify, had this just been a stock Fedora

34:23.960 --> 34:26.160
install, like you hadn't gone through the process in GNOME

34:26.160 --> 34:28.360
software where you install proprietary stuff?

34:28.360 --> 34:30.200
And you just have Intel graphics, right?

34:30.200 --> 34:33.320
Yep, I've just been following everything as traditional

34:33.320 --> 34:34.880
as I could get it.

34:34.880 --> 34:37.040
So I, till this moment, cannot tell you

34:37.040 --> 34:40.200
what changed that suddenly has this alert going off.

34:40.200 --> 34:43.840
So I close it out, and I'm thinking, OK, I do an update.

34:43.840 --> 34:45.440
I turn off the computer.

34:45.440 --> 34:46.440
I reboot it.

34:46.440 --> 34:47.960
I want to say I did it three times,

34:47.960 --> 34:50.440
because I think I actually did, just to be safe.

34:50.440 --> 34:53.640
And I come back, and suddenly I have another kernel error

34:53.640 --> 34:56.840
with no additional information, just kernel error.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.120
So I close it out.

34:58.120 --> 34:58.860
I turn it off.

34:58.860 --> 35:00.480
I turn it back on again, and we're back

35:00.480 --> 35:02.280
to the tainted system message.

35:02.280 --> 35:04.080
So at that point, I'm thinking, OK,

35:04.080 --> 35:07.160
this must be really bad, because they keep notifying me

35:07.160 --> 35:08.560
every time I turn it on.

35:08.560 --> 35:10.320
And it's when I start asking you guys,

35:10.320 --> 35:13.520
is there a tool that I can use to test my kernel's integrity?

35:13.520 --> 35:15.840
And is this even something I should be doing?

35:15.840 --> 35:18.000
I hadn't heard the term tainted kernel,

35:18.000 --> 35:21.320
but then doing searching, I realized

35:21.320 --> 35:23.920
it's been around for a little bit.

35:23.920 --> 35:29.280
And it really kind of comes from the, I mean,

35:29.280 --> 35:31.760
from what I could kind of grok searching on it,

35:31.760 --> 35:34.160
from the perspective of the kernel developers,

35:34.160 --> 35:37.000
considering the kernel to be tainted.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.240
Would you say that's accurate?

35:38.240 --> 35:38.520
Yeah.

35:38.520 --> 35:40.520
And I think one thing we should think about here

35:40.520 --> 35:42.080
is when you load a module, you're

35:42.080 --> 35:44.520
loading like a part of the kernel, right?

35:44.520 --> 35:46.680
You get access to kernel memory, the kernel space.

35:46.680 --> 35:48.340
You can do some pretty dangerous things.

35:48.340 --> 35:51.080
And so if you do have some weird condition,

35:51.080 --> 35:52.600
and you're trying to debug the kernel,

35:52.600 --> 35:53.600
that might not be useful, right?

35:53.600 --> 35:55.600
If you've loaded some weird proprietary driver

35:55.600 --> 35:59.520
that the kernel developers can't see or touch or really access,

35:59.520 --> 36:00.940
who knows what it did to memory?

36:00.940 --> 36:02.800
And that might have been causing the fault.

36:02.800 --> 36:05.240
So they want to know that's one access, but it could also be.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.280
And I think this is what happened in L's case.

36:07.280 --> 36:08.440
It was just a warning, right?

36:08.440 --> 36:09.840
So something went wrong.

36:09.840 --> 36:12.480
The atheros driver didn't like some change

36:12.480 --> 36:14.840
when it came back up from sleep in this particular kernel

36:14.840 --> 36:16.960
version, emitted a warning, and then that

36:16.960 --> 36:18.920
is enough to say, look, something unusual

36:18.920 --> 36:20.040
happened with the kernel.

36:20.040 --> 36:23.400
So even though the atheros driver is open source, and it's

36:23.400 --> 36:25.800
Yeah, it's not just related to license or proprietary.

36:25.800 --> 36:27.920
It's really just to understand in the debugging

36:27.920 --> 36:30.160
context, did something weird happen

36:30.160 --> 36:32.480
to this kernel that won't actually help us?

36:32.480 --> 36:33.880
Or another way to put that would be,

36:33.880 --> 36:35.440
where's the line of responsibility?

36:35.440 --> 36:37.600
Is it the kernel developer's responsibility?

36:37.600 --> 36:39.480
Is it the distro maintainer's responsibility?

36:39.480 --> 36:41.920
Or is it the driver developer's?

36:41.920 --> 36:44.920
I mean, there's even stuff where the BIOS can send a signal

36:44.920 --> 36:47.220
that there's been some weird machine check exception.

36:47.220 --> 36:48.640
And that can be considered the kernel tainted,

36:48.640 --> 36:50.180
because again, who knows what happened?

36:50.180 --> 36:54.000
But I kind of feel like it does highlight and really underscore

36:54.000 --> 36:58.020
how this system isn't really built for end users,

36:58.020 --> 36:58.840
necessarily.

36:58.840 --> 37:03.320
So if I honestly, even myself, if I saw a tainted kernel,

37:03.320 --> 37:05.280
I would think I've been compromised in some way.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.040
I would immediately start Google searching

37:07.040 --> 37:08.800
and probably figure it out eventually.

37:08.800 --> 37:12.120
But I would look at that and think, something is bad.

37:12.120 --> 37:17.320
Either my system is busted, or I have been hacked

37:17.320 --> 37:18.880
or compromised.

37:18.880 --> 37:20.680
Maybe that repository I just added.

37:20.680 --> 37:22.640
You start going and looking for problems.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.320
Which could be useful, but also might just be a rabbit hole.

37:25.320 --> 37:29.120
Like, Elle, were you experiencing Wi-Fi problems before this?

37:29.120 --> 37:30.760
Or was your Wi-Fi generally working?

37:30.760 --> 37:34.000
No, and I didn't have any problems even after it started.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.520
All I had to go on was that one error message.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.760
So it wasn't even a problem.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.880
So is this maybe a case of Fedora

37:41.880 --> 37:43.200
just being a little over-aggressive

37:43.200 --> 37:44.400
in displaying information?

37:44.400 --> 37:46.520
Maybe other distros are having the same warning.

37:46.520 --> 37:48.360
They're just not telling you about it?

37:48.360 --> 37:52.360
It's like a computer that's a hypochondriac.

37:52.360 --> 37:56.400
You start searching for a problem when there is none that exists.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.360
I looked at this, and of course, my response was,

37:59.360 --> 38:01.480
well, I would have put an Intel chip in there.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.480
That's what I would have.

38:02.480 --> 38:05.240
And that's such a typical Linux user response.

38:05.240 --> 38:06.880
And I hate to be that guy.

38:06.880 --> 38:07.880
Oh, I just would have.

38:07.880 --> 38:09.760
Just pop open the back of your XPS

38:09.760 --> 38:12.280
and put an Intel chip in there.

38:12.280 --> 38:13.960
Yeah, right.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.960
We can't tell people to do that.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.360
Some of us are fine, but other people.

38:18.360 --> 38:20.000
Sometimes people don't need their system.

38:20.000 --> 38:20.800
They don't own it.

38:20.800 --> 38:21.960
It's a work system.

38:21.960 --> 38:23.440
They can't.

38:23.440 --> 38:26.240
And that's where I think we're going to move on to this

38:26.240 --> 38:27.120
as we keep discussing.

38:27.120 --> 38:30.320
But it's OK to present how you can do that to get better

38:30.320 --> 38:31.720
and more compatible hardware.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.240
But you can't expect that everyone's

38:33.240 --> 38:36.360
going to have the means or access or control to do that.

38:36.360 --> 38:37.520
Yeah.

38:37.520 --> 38:41.080
So I guess that would probably be a good segue

38:41.080 --> 38:43.360
to talk about the thing that we've been discussing

38:43.360 --> 38:45.360
internally recently.

38:45.360 --> 38:49.600
About every three months or so, somebody

38:49.600 --> 38:53.880
discovers that Jim Zimlin, the head of the Linux Foundation,

38:53.880 --> 38:55.200
has a MacBook.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.360
And they try to get a few clicks from it.

38:57.360 --> 38:59.960
And they try to get a bunch of outrage going.

38:59.960 --> 39:04.240
And it creates this really nasty dialogue

39:04.240 --> 39:07.240
in the different places where the community has its dialogues.

39:07.240 --> 39:09.240
And we all know where those places are.

39:09.240 --> 39:12.720
And a lot of the times, it comes down to,

39:12.720 --> 39:14.960
like, here's a couple of headlines.

39:14.960 --> 39:17.320
We're not going to link to these articles in the show notes

39:17.320 --> 39:20.480
because, again, it's clickbait.

39:20.480 --> 39:21.840
But there's headlines.

39:21.840 --> 39:24.120
And I guess if you really want it, you could go read it.

39:24.120 --> 39:25.480
But here's a headline.

39:25.480 --> 39:29.080
Jim Zimlin, head of Linux Foundation, friend or foe,

39:29.080 --> 39:31.200
uses Mac OS.

39:31.200 --> 39:35.360
And it's got some really solid logic in the article

39:35.360 --> 39:40.680
as you read through it, like things like fun fact

39:40.680 --> 39:42.000
and other things like that.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.320
Here's another article headline.

39:44.320 --> 39:47.520
Jim Zimlin's Linux Foundation still does not

39:47.520 --> 39:50.360
care about Linux desktops.

39:50.360 --> 39:51.760
Boom.

39:51.760 --> 39:54.080
Just dropping it right there.

39:54.080 --> 39:58.880
And I've kind of been that guy.

39:58.880 --> 40:01.320
You could probably put a highlight reel together

40:01.320 --> 40:04.240
of me being like, why are there so many MacBooks at Linux

40:04.240 --> 40:06.120
events and giving people hard times?

40:06.120 --> 40:09.600
Like, probably a good, solid few minutes

40:09.600 --> 40:11.320
of years of me saying that.

40:11.320 --> 40:12.320
So I've been there.

40:12.320 --> 40:14.000
I understand.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.520
But there is sort of a line, I think.

40:16.520 --> 40:24.600
And as Linux becomes more and more dominant on the server,

40:24.600 --> 40:26.800
there will be more and more users

40:26.800 --> 40:29.680
that come to Linux for very practical reasons

40:29.680 --> 40:31.800
for their job, to create software

40:31.800 --> 40:34.320
to run on those servers in the cloud.

40:34.320 --> 40:37.600
And they don't really care about your free software

40:37.600 --> 40:38.880
or your open source.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.920
And it doesn't mean that there isn't an opportunity

40:40.920 --> 40:44.240
to educate them, but it means you could scare them away.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.200
And I'm going to tell you, I have an example

40:46.200 --> 40:47.600
that we're going to talk about here in a moment.

40:47.600 --> 40:50.280
But before we get there, I want to talk about something that

40:50.280 --> 40:52.760
was published on March 23rd.

40:52.760 --> 40:55.360
Funny enough, Wes, did you notice it actually says

40:55.360 --> 40:57.440
published March 23rd slash 24th?

40:57.440 --> 41:00.040
Maybe it was published at midnight.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.320
By Richard Stallman.

41:01.320 --> 41:04.280
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

41:04.280 --> 41:07.440
And I think this is the root cause here.

41:07.440 --> 41:11.360
It goes back to the beginning of the free software movement.

41:11.360 --> 41:13.760
It is in our DNA.

41:13.760 --> 41:17.720
It is fundamentally at the root of our culture.

41:17.720 --> 41:19.760
So perhaps it is unfixable.

41:19.760 --> 41:23.240
But I want to read something.

41:23.240 --> 41:27.240
And I would like you, listener, to draw your own conclusions.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.640
You can read the entire piece.

41:28.640 --> 41:29.920
We'll have it linked in the show notes.

41:29.920 --> 41:32.480
I'll read a highlight.

41:32.480 --> 41:34.320
I'll try not to do a Richard Stallman voice.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.000
And I guess I should say the context of this

41:36.000 --> 41:38.640
is Richard Stallman is talking about install fests.

41:38.640 --> 41:40.960
And he writes, if users have to wrestle

41:40.960 --> 41:43.120
with this choice between installing

41:43.120 --> 41:45.680
proprietary software and free software only,

41:45.680 --> 41:48.400
then they should draw at least a moral lesson from it

41:48.400 --> 41:50.760
and maybe get a better computer later.

41:50.760 --> 41:52.880
But when the install fest makes compromises

41:52.880 --> 41:55.520
on the user's behalf, say it shelters the user

41:55.520 --> 41:58.660
from a moral decision, the user never

41:58.660 --> 42:02.920
sees something other than convenience is at stake.

42:02.920 --> 42:07.680
In effect, the install fest makes the deal with the devil

42:07.680 --> 42:09.840
on the user's behalf.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.180
There's a couple of things in here

42:11.180 --> 42:15.000
that I already find fascinating.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.600
We start with the assumed that for everyone,

42:17.600 --> 42:21.080
this is a moral decision and a moral lesson.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.760
So that's an assumed in this conversation, which I actually

42:23.760 --> 42:26.240
think could be debated.

42:26.240 --> 42:28.320
You could also debate if it should or shouldn't

42:28.320 --> 42:30.520
be a moral decision, but I think it's not

42:30.520 --> 42:33.480
a moral decision for everybody.

42:33.480 --> 42:36.000
And the compromises that the install fest

42:36.000 --> 42:38.460
is making on the user's behalf would

42:38.460 --> 42:41.560
be the compromises that make Linux work on the machine

42:41.560 --> 42:42.920
that they're installing it.

42:42.920 --> 42:45.480
The difference between Wi-Fi or no Wi-Fi.

42:45.480 --> 42:47.520
You come to an install fest because you

42:47.520 --> 42:49.440
want to leave with a working Linux system.

42:49.440 --> 42:52.400
Otherwise, you just do it at home.

42:52.400 --> 42:53.800
So he goes on to write.

42:53.800 --> 42:56.800
Oh, and then obviously, I should point out

42:56.800 --> 42:59.320
the deal with the devil.

42:59.320 --> 43:02.120
We're invoking religious language here, the devil.

43:02.120 --> 43:04.280
Also, just as a point here, it makes

43:04.280 --> 43:06.400
it sound like this is a deal that's signed forever,

43:06.400 --> 43:12.800
but you can install truly free software later.

43:12.800 --> 43:15.760
That's the whole problem here is you can start with Ubuntu,

43:15.760 --> 43:17.880
and we all distro hop.

43:17.880 --> 43:19.480
Sometimes that includes distributions

43:19.480 --> 43:21.320
from the Free Software Foundation.

43:21.320 --> 43:22.200
Yeah, that's true.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.920
You could learn, get inspired, and move on.

43:24.920 --> 43:25.840
Absolutely.

43:25.840 --> 43:28.080
In fact, I think that's the way it generally happens.

43:28.080 --> 43:29.800
So Richard Stallman has a proposal.

43:29.800 --> 43:32.680
He says, I propose the install fest show users exactly what

43:32.680 --> 43:34.120
deal they're making.

43:34.120 --> 43:38.680
Let them talk to the devil individually.

43:38.680 --> 43:40.920
My new idea is that the install fest

43:40.920 --> 43:43.560
could allow the devil to hang around off

43:43.560 --> 43:47.360
at a corner of the hall or the next room.

43:47.360 --> 43:49.160
Then he writes in brackets, actually,

43:49.160 --> 43:52.000
a human being wearing a sign saying, the devil, maybe

43:52.000 --> 43:53.120
some horns.

43:53.120 --> 43:55.080
Like, have some fun with it, he's suggesting.

43:55.080 --> 43:57.680
Have some fun with this one.

43:57.680 --> 44:00.720
The devil would offer to install non-free drivers

44:00.720 --> 44:03.680
in the user's machine to make more parts of the computer

44:03.680 --> 44:04.960
function.

44:04.960 --> 44:06.600
Take that in for a second.

44:06.600 --> 44:12.640
The devil would install non-free drivers in the user's machine

44:12.640 --> 44:16.680
to make more parts of the computer function.

44:16.680 --> 44:18.840
It's almost an admission right there in itself,

44:18.840 --> 44:20.320
but it's the devil doing it.

44:20.320 --> 44:22.120
That's the devil.

44:22.120 --> 44:23.800
The devil would explain to the user

44:23.800 --> 44:29.040
the cost of this using non-free unjust programs.

44:29.040 --> 44:34.080
The install fest would tolerate the devil's presence,

44:34.080 --> 44:38.120
but not officially sponsor the devil

44:38.120 --> 44:42.400
or publicize the devil's availability.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.000
He goes on to say, I should note,

44:44.000 --> 44:45.840
that Richard Stallman says he does not

44:45.840 --> 44:47.680
approve of the devil's work here.

44:47.680 --> 44:50.360
And he wraps it up with, what is to stop the devil

44:50.360 --> 44:52.000
from offering to install something

44:52.000 --> 44:56.800
like GNU slash Linux distros, such as Ubuntu,

44:56.800 --> 45:01.160
which offers the user other attractive non-free programs,

45:01.160 --> 45:04.960
not solely ones needed for the machine's hardware

45:04.960 --> 45:06.520
to function at all.

45:09.120 --> 45:10.600
That's a concern he has.

45:10.600 --> 45:12.800
I mean, does that make Ubuntu worse than the devil?

45:12.800 --> 45:15.040
The devil might install Ubuntu.

45:15.040 --> 45:18.360
And then here's the reason why that's not good.

45:18.360 --> 45:21.520
Because it installs programs that are not solely

45:21.520 --> 45:26.160
just necessary for the machine to function, barely function

45:26.160 --> 45:27.200
at all.

45:27.200 --> 45:29.240
If you are installing software beyond that

45:29.240 --> 45:33.120
to get the bare necessary functions,

45:33.120 --> 45:37.200
then you're making a deal with the devil.

45:37.200 --> 45:41.800
That is our problem.

45:41.800 --> 45:45.640
This is not a religious thing.

45:45.640 --> 45:48.520
These are tools.

45:48.520 --> 45:52.800
These are tools made by human beings.

45:52.800 --> 45:55.720
These are not religious objects.

45:55.720 --> 45:58.880
There are moral questions about their usage and software.

45:58.880 --> 45:59.840
Absolutely.

45:59.840 --> 46:03.040
But this, I see over and over again.

46:03.040 --> 46:06.760
And I'm redacting the names to protect the innocent.

46:06.760 --> 46:11.480
Because to be honest with you, I mean,

46:11.480 --> 46:14.640
maybe we see this on a twice-monthly basis,

46:14.640 --> 46:16.640
really, where somebody comes in and they say,

46:16.640 --> 46:20.200
Chris, I'm so frustrated, or Wes, I'm so frustrated.

46:20.200 --> 46:22.320
I've been trying to get so-and-so to switch to Linux,

46:22.320 --> 46:23.620
and they're just not listening.

46:23.620 --> 46:26.120
They won't even try it.

46:26.120 --> 46:26.720
We've seen that.

46:26.720 --> 46:28.680
Yeah, absolutely.

46:28.680 --> 46:30.680
And sometimes you listen and you go, yeah, OK,

46:30.680 --> 46:32.080
boy, that does sound like a good use case.

46:32.080 --> 46:33.560
Yeah, they just leave my office.

46:33.560 --> 46:37.560
You put Ubuntu or put Fedora on there, and they're good to go.

46:37.560 --> 46:40.800
And then sometimes it doesn't make any sense.

46:40.800 --> 46:47.840
And I realize now that I was that person.

46:47.840 --> 46:48.600
I did this.

46:48.600 --> 46:51.320
So what I'm about to talk about, I want to make clear,

46:51.320 --> 46:52.360
I was this person.

46:52.360 --> 46:54.080
I think probably many of us have been.

46:54.080 --> 46:55.120
Yeah, I got excited, man.

46:55.120 --> 46:56.160
Because Linux is exciting.

46:56.160 --> 46:57.840
It's a great operating system.

46:57.840 --> 46:59.720
You can go back into the history of these shows.

46:59.720 --> 47:05.120
And my advocacy and mandating Linux

47:05.120 --> 47:08.120
be used for every task is laid out

47:08.120 --> 47:10.280
to bear in front of everybody.

47:10.280 --> 47:11.640
But I've had to think about it.

47:11.640 --> 47:13.200
I've got to be honest with you.

47:13.200 --> 47:16.160
In part, because of issues we've had in the studio,

47:16.160 --> 47:18.040
if I'm going to be effective in my job,

47:18.040 --> 47:21.360
I need to self-analyze and realize

47:21.360 --> 47:26.860
where I failed to properly consider the situation.

47:26.860 --> 47:28.400
And we don't need to go into details

47:28.400 --> 47:29.680
about the problems we've had.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.360
If you guys are interested, you can email into the show

47:31.360 --> 47:31.880
and ask us.

47:31.880 --> 47:34.760
But we've had a range of issues that we're kind of starting

47:34.760 --> 47:36.040
to get a handle on now.

47:36.040 --> 47:37.480
But just operational things, right?

47:37.480 --> 47:40.060
Nothing core to the content of the shows,

47:40.060 --> 47:41.760
just stuff that are little details

47:41.760 --> 47:43.600
that we have to do every day to make the stuff happen.

47:43.600 --> 47:46.520
Yeah, like you discover, oh, this was a design decision

47:46.520 --> 47:48.280
and also that's now creating this problem.

47:48.280 --> 47:50.920
Or Pulse isn't talking to this when this application is

47:50.920 --> 47:52.440
talking directly to the internet.

47:52.440 --> 47:54.680
You discover all these little weird problems

47:54.680 --> 47:58.520
that make it kind of obvious that there's not a lot of people

47:58.520 --> 47:59.520
doing what we're doing.

47:59.520 --> 48:01.120
You can make it work, but there's

48:01.120 --> 48:06.220
not a business and ecosystem around this.

48:06.220 --> 48:08.840
And I want to make it clear.

48:08.840 --> 48:11.440
I think Linux is maybe one of the most important software

48:11.440 --> 48:14.080
projects in the world, in the history of humanity,

48:14.080 --> 48:17.820
and probably the most important free software project.

48:17.820 --> 48:20.040
And as somebody who's run many Linux servers

48:20.040 --> 48:21.920
and still has them running and is very happy,

48:21.920 --> 48:25.080
I think it is the best operating system for servers.

48:25.080 --> 48:26.440
Why do you suppose that is?

48:26.440 --> 48:30.000
Why is Linux so goddamn good on the server,

48:30.000 --> 48:33.600
and yet it's sometimes a little hit and miss on the desktop?

48:33.600 --> 48:36.120
Sometimes you get tainted kernels.

48:36.120 --> 48:39.840
Sometimes you get these issues that crop up.

48:39.840 --> 48:42.680
Why is it hit and miss where Pulse audio sometimes

48:42.680 --> 48:45.160
creates a Barry White effect, and to the live stream,

48:45.160 --> 48:47.520
we sound like three octaves lower than we actually

48:47.520 --> 48:49.560
are because it's failed to communicate properly

48:49.560 --> 48:52.280
with the audio hardware, but yet the server side

48:52.280 --> 48:54.920
can generate billions of dollars in revenue

48:54.920 --> 48:57.920
and get 99.9999% uptime.

48:57.920 --> 48:59.600
Why is that, Wes?

48:59.600 --> 49:02.440
Part of it, I think, has to do a little bit with complexity

49:02.440 --> 49:05.840
and the assumption of how skilled or knowledgeable you

49:05.840 --> 49:07.160
need to be to operate the system,

49:07.160 --> 49:09.000
now that we've made leaps and bounds there in the server.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.740
But when you think about how it started taking off,

49:11.740 --> 49:14.560
it was a free, useful tool that you could just install.

49:14.560 --> 49:18.160
And if you had the know-how to get it installed and up

49:18.160 --> 49:20.240
and running, you could be very effective at it.

49:20.240 --> 49:22.440
You could replace really expensive other rigs

49:22.440 --> 49:24.880
that you had to buy with just cheap Intel equipment.

49:24.880 --> 49:25.920
Right.

49:25.920 --> 49:29.000
And I would say, too, one of the things that

49:29.000 --> 49:32.720
makes Android successful, the Linux underpinnings there,

49:32.720 --> 49:38.480
and Linux successful on the server, is a massive ecosystem

49:38.480 --> 49:43.120
of contributors from companies like Amazon, and Microsoft,

49:43.120 --> 49:45.560
and Intel, and Qualcomm, and Samsung.

49:45.560 --> 49:47.360
And the list goes on and on.

49:47.360 --> 49:49.440
Everybody knows the big list of contributors that are.

49:49.440 --> 49:50.920
Big list of diverse contributors

49:50.920 --> 49:53.080
from different fields that are all interested in this core

49:53.080 --> 49:53.920
underpinning.

49:53.920 --> 49:54.420
Right.

49:54.420 --> 49:57.560
And that translates to them spending money on developer

49:57.560 --> 50:01.880
time to write code to contribute to these areas of the free

50:01.880 --> 50:03.160
software stack.

50:03.160 --> 50:05.200
And it's the whole range from things

50:05.200 --> 50:07.240
that are application server-side things

50:07.240 --> 50:08.940
all the way down to the kernel that makes

50:08.940 --> 50:10.280
it work better on ARM devices.

50:10.280 --> 50:12.880
It's a whole range where there is

50:12.880 --> 50:16.760
a network of interdependent and competing businesses

50:16.760 --> 50:19.640
that have economic incentives to contribute code

50:19.640 --> 50:23.280
to this free software code base.

50:23.280 --> 50:27.760
Those economic incentives do not exist in the audio and video

50:27.760 --> 50:29.480
production side, where you're trying

50:29.480 --> 50:33.920
to do real-time audio or video in a fairly complicated setup,

50:33.920 --> 50:38.080
maybe with multiple interfaces, six, seven, 10 tracks at once.

50:38.080 --> 50:39.760
And you're audio in on one interface,

50:39.760 --> 50:43.160
audio out on another interface, but they have the same name.

50:43.160 --> 50:47.980
That is not an area where there is an economy of companies,

50:47.980 --> 50:51.520
some of the largest companies in the world, contributing code.

50:51.520 --> 50:54.660
Pulse Audio does not have that benefit.

50:54.660 --> 50:56.540
Neither does Video for Linux.

50:56.540 --> 50:59.720
They are great projects that have had developers that

50:59.720 --> 51:02.440
have been committed to them for a very long time.

51:02.440 --> 51:03.600
Man, am I grateful.

51:03.600 --> 51:04.800
And they've come a long way.

51:04.800 --> 51:06.360
I mean, it's a lot better than it used to be.

51:06.360 --> 51:08.320
And we have things come in, like PipeWire,

51:08.320 --> 51:10.920
that just look fantastic.

51:10.920 --> 51:15.520
But again, there is maybe a company or two.

51:15.520 --> 51:17.520
And they're less mission critical, too.

51:17.520 --> 51:20.200
So you can put up with that if your employee's desktop,

51:20.200 --> 51:22.120
occasionally the sound doesn't quite work right,

51:22.120 --> 51:25.100
but it's a bigger deal when your kernel crashes on your server.

51:25.100 --> 51:29.080
And I don't think any of this is unusual.

51:29.080 --> 51:31.760
I think it's perfectly fine to expect maybe

51:31.760 --> 51:36.560
that the audio system on Linux isn't quite as solid as it

51:36.560 --> 51:40.360
is on a top 500 computer running a compute project,

51:40.360 --> 51:43.480
or the web server and database application stacks that

51:43.480 --> 51:45.960
are completely rock solid don't quite match up

51:45.960 --> 51:48.680
to how video capture works on Linux.

51:48.680 --> 51:50.960
It seems incredibly reasonable when you look at it

51:50.960 --> 51:51.640
in that context.

51:51.640 --> 51:52.880
I think it's natural, right?

51:52.880 --> 51:55.800
Because it is a successful free open source project,

51:55.800 --> 51:58.200
it can be taken in all the directions that people want to.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.160
You just have to have contributors.

51:59.160 --> 52:01.240
So the more contributors you have in each direction,

52:01.240 --> 52:02.440
then it can grow there.

52:02.440 --> 52:05.040
But I didn't see it.

52:05.040 --> 52:06.560
See, I didn't see it.

52:06.560 --> 52:12.320
Because I let what was a faith in my advocacy for Linux

52:12.320 --> 52:16.560
blind me to what is a simple economic market reality.

52:16.560 --> 52:19.560
I think it's confusing, too, because we're

52:19.560 --> 52:21.400
talking about general computers here, right?

52:21.400 --> 52:23.640
But we're also talking about specific tools or workflow.

52:23.640 --> 52:25.640
Some of the stuff that we use for a computer, like in audio,

52:25.640 --> 52:27.040
that could be a piece of equipment on the rack.

52:27.040 --> 52:28.720
And we don't have the same conversation

52:28.720 --> 52:30.440
to the same degree about that.

52:30.440 --> 52:33.060
And I want to try to use Linux for all the things

52:33.060 --> 52:34.560
because I think it's a great platform

52:34.560 --> 52:37.280
and it's easy for me to be like, I could do audio editing

52:37.280 --> 52:39.080
on Windows, but I would prefer to figure out

52:39.080 --> 52:40.280
how to do it on Linux.

52:40.280 --> 52:42.840
That doesn't mean that Linux is the best at it.

52:42.840 --> 52:46.320
And if my whole job and only focus was audio production,

52:46.320 --> 52:47.840
then I probably wouldn't choose Linux

52:47.840 --> 52:50.480
just because there aren't some of the tools I might need.

52:50.480 --> 52:53.840
Right, and I didn't give that consideration

52:53.840 --> 52:56.760
even though this is my business.

52:56.760 --> 52:59.080
And to be clear, we're not ripping Linux out.

52:59.080 --> 53:00.440
We're going to try to make this work.

53:00.440 --> 53:02.200
We think we can get this.

53:02.200 --> 53:04.560
I just now look back at it, and I

53:04.560 --> 53:09.300
realize that this was a blind spot that I had.

53:09.300 --> 53:12.200
My advocacy for Linux blinded me to what

53:12.200 --> 53:14.980
was obvious limitations just given the market

53:14.980 --> 53:17.320
realities of the situation.

53:17.320 --> 53:19.520
And so I got a note in on Telegram

53:19.520 --> 53:21.440
in our Jupyter broadcasting group about, Chris,

53:21.440 --> 53:24.800
I'm super frustrated because I can't get Adam Curry to switch

53:24.800 --> 53:26.120
to Linux.

53:26.120 --> 53:29.360
And I looked at the situation, I said, you know, man,

53:29.360 --> 53:30.840
I think what really is going on here

53:30.840 --> 53:33.560
is there's really zero incentive for someone

53:33.560 --> 53:36.720
to make a switch for that workflow when you're recording,

53:36.720 --> 53:39.240
you're live streaming, you're editing.

53:39.240 --> 53:42.040
Linux is great, but it's not necessarily better

53:42.040 --> 53:44.760
than Windows at that job.

53:44.760 --> 53:48.720
And there is a cost to switching because he

53:48.720 --> 53:52.680
would have to change recording applications and editing

53:52.680 --> 53:53.680
applications.

53:53.680 --> 53:55.880
He would have to learn a new desktop

53:55.880 --> 53:57.040
and a new operating system.

53:57.040 --> 53:58.880
Like, there's a cost.

53:58.880 --> 54:01.200
And he just wants to get the show done.

54:01.200 --> 54:02.480
He just wants to make money.

54:02.480 --> 54:03.440
That's where it is, right?

54:03.440 --> 54:04.400
There's always a cost, and there's

54:04.400 --> 54:06.040
going to be some cost-benefit curve,

54:06.040 --> 54:08.440
and you have to decide, like, where does it make sense

54:08.440 --> 54:09.560
and where is it good enough?

54:09.560 --> 54:13.960
So I get notes from other podcasters

54:13.960 --> 54:16.440
that have the same thing, and the kind of general response

54:16.440 --> 54:18.440
is like, man, the Linux community is really nagging me.

54:18.440 --> 54:20.360
Like, they're just really nagging me constantly.

54:20.360 --> 54:22.320
They say, you guys do it on Linux,

54:22.320 --> 54:24.000
but it doesn't seem worth it to me.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.400
And I don't recommend that they switch when they write to me

54:27.400 --> 54:30.080
because I don't feel like it would be necessarily

54:30.080 --> 54:32.000
a successful transition.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.520
I think for advocacy to be successful,

54:34.520 --> 54:39.080
we need to advocate in a new way, in a different way,

54:39.080 --> 54:42.960
something that is less like just blind advocacy where we're

54:42.960 --> 54:46.960
saying, yeah, Linux can do every job in every situation.

54:46.960 --> 54:48.120
That's true in most cases.

54:48.120 --> 54:49.720
You can probably make it work, right?

54:49.720 --> 54:50.160
And that's right.

54:50.160 --> 54:51.920
That's the difference between saying, like,

54:51.920 --> 54:54.840
you can do it on Linux, and you should do it on Linux.

54:54.840 --> 54:55.560
Bingo.

54:55.560 --> 54:57.320
And if you're trying to recommend something

54:57.320 --> 54:59.760
to somebody, you're trying to get them to switch,

54:59.760 --> 55:01.800
you've got to think about the workflow.

55:01.800 --> 55:04.600
And you've got to think about what your approach is.

55:04.600 --> 55:07.680
First of all, you can't just go all in crazy,

55:07.680 --> 55:10.080
like switch everything at once.

55:10.080 --> 55:13.360
But you also have to consider, is Linux

55:13.360 --> 55:14.920
the right tool for that job?

55:14.920 --> 55:17.560
Because for them, it's not a moral decision.

55:17.560 --> 55:20.640
It's not something that speaks to who they are

55:20.640 --> 55:23.000
and how they feel about the future of software

55:23.000 --> 55:24.880
and computers.

55:24.880 --> 55:28.680
It's simply a tool like their blender is a tool.

55:28.680 --> 55:29.200
Yeah, right.

55:29.200 --> 55:31.440
And I imagine that most people who

55:31.440 --> 55:34.440
find the philosophy of free software interesting

55:34.440 --> 55:36.960
did not come to it, did not come to these tools because

55:36.960 --> 55:37.760
of the philosophy, right?

55:37.760 --> 55:39.480
They probably learned about the philosophy

55:39.480 --> 55:41.400
after they started using some of these tools.

55:41.400 --> 55:43.320
You're only going to do that if you stick around,

55:43.320 --> 55:45.280
because the tool is effective.

55:45.280 --> 55:48.040
And I think we should, I kind of feel like we

55:48.040 --> 55:51.520
should be as a community, we should be OK with the fact

55:51.520 --> 55:54.880
that it's not great at video games.

55:54.880 --> 55:57.380
It gets better, but X11 has issues,

55:57.380 --> 55:59.160
and video card drivers have issues,

55:59.160 --> 56:01.240
and software availability has issues.

56:01.240 --> 56:04.680
It's not the best at video production and podcast

56:04.680 --> 56:05.200
production.

56:05.200 --> 56:07.800
It's usable, it's doable, but it has issues.

56:07.800 --> 56:10.280
Like we should acknowledge that, so that way when

56:10.280 --> 56:12.420
you do recommend Linux to somebody,

56:12.420 --> 56:13.640
it's a successful transition.

56:13.640 --> 56:16.200
Yeah, be honest about expectations, right?

56:16.200 --> 56:18.200
So that people aren't sad and depressed,

56:18.200 --> 56:19.440
or think bad about Linux, and just be like,

56:19.440 --> 56:20.520
here's the things that's great at,

56:20.520 --> 56:22.200
and here are some things that you might struggle at,

56:22.200 --> 56:23.960
or if that's what you really need to do,

56:23.960 --> 56:25.160
maybe this isn't a good fit.

56:25.160 --> 56:27.640
And I feel like, too, on top of that,

56:27.640 --> 56:31.160
it's clear there are workloads that Linux is great at.

56:31.160 --> 56:31.760
Absolutely.

56:31.760 --> 56:32.760
And clear winners.

56:32.760 --> 56:34.600
And that's where you double down,

56:34.600 --> 56:37.120
and you just have to be careful in your advocacy.

56:37.120 --> 56:38.840
You have to take a slow approach,

56:38.840 --> 56:42.280
and demonstrate success, and show your workflow working.

56:42.280 --> 56:44.200
A slow approach is it, right?

56:44.200 --> 56:46.000
Because this isn't a one and done deal.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.280
You can make inroads, right?

56:47.280 --> 56:48.760
Maybe first you set up a code box,

56:48.760 --> 56:50.200
and tell people that it's Linux.

56:50.200 --> 56:51.520
They get a little trust there.

56:51.520 --> 56:53.480
Then you set up a new machine that is Linux,

56:53.480 --> 56:54.360
and you say, here you go.

56:54.360 --> 56:57.440
It's great for browsing the web on the couch, have at it.

56:57.440 --> 56:59.440
You can do this gradually in a way

56:59.440 --> 57:02.240
where people can learn to trust it, enjoy it.

57:02.240 --> 57:04.240
And then is the time, once you see

57:04.240 --> 57:07.000
that this is a great tool with a great ecosystem of tools,

57:07.000 --> 57:08.920
you can start explaining how a lot of that's

57:08.920 --> 57:11.240
possible because of free and open source philosophy.

57:11.240 --> 57:11.960
Yeah, exactly.

57:11.960 --> 57:13.920
All right, let's start going around the horn here

57:13.920 --> 57:15.440
and see what other people think.

57:15.440 --> 57:17.440
So let's start with Mr. Bacon, because you've been

57:17.440 --> 57:18.840
in the community for a long time.

57:18.840 --> 57:21.960
You've seen the different types of pushy advocacy

57:21.960 --> 57:23.960
versus subtle advocacy.

57:23.960 --> 57:25.920
And I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

57:25.920 --> 57:29.640
One thing, and I think this can kind of go across the board,

57:29.640 --> 57:33.840
is that the IRC room, or Telegram, or forums,

57:33.840 --> 57:35.680
or whatever community that you're a part of,

57:35.680 --> 57:39.360
if somebody is asking for help, be that guy that actually

57:39.360 --> 57:41.360
reaches out and tries to give some help.

57:41.360 --> 57:44.640
Don't be the guy that RTFMs them,

57:44.640 --> 57:46.880
or is elitist and says they should

57:46.880 --> 57:49.520
use this instead of that.

57:49.520 --> 57:52.840
Try to help guide them to the path.

57:52.840 --> 57:56.680
But one thing I would say, as far as the advocacy goes,

57:56.680 --> 57:58.960
is that I think that there's, like you said,

57:58.960 --> 58:00.120
there's different approaches.

58:00.120 --> 58:02.080
There's always the tool for the job.

58:02.080 --> 58:05.920
Linux is rock solid on the server side of things.

58:05.920 --> 58:08.520
It's getting there on the desktop.

58:08.520 --> 58:11.800
And some of these companies actually put their money

58:11.800 --> 58:13.480
where their mouth is.

58:13.480 --> 58:17.560
So you have System76, I'm sure Emma could speak to that.

58:17.560 --> 58:23.560
They're actually integrating Core Boot now.

58:23.560 --> 58:26.360
You have people like Purism as well.

58:26.360 --> 58:29.240
And they're slowly advocating these things

58:29.240 --> 58:33.920
for us to be able to utilize and give us the tools that we need.

58:33.920 --> 58:36.360
But they're not pushy about it.

58:36.360 --> 58:39.760
And I think being overly preachy,

58:39.760 --> 58:41.560
and I know that I was whenever I first

58:41.560 --> 58:44.560
started using Linux as well, but being overly preachy

58:44.560 --> 58:48.080
is really going to do nothing but drive people away

58:48.080 --> 58:48.880
from it.

58:48.880 --> 58:53.880
I'm curious, too, we'll get to the folks in the Mumbroom

58:53.880 --> 58:56.040
here in a second, but, Elle, one of the things

58:56.040 --> 58:58.280
I've noticed as you've been documenting your issues

58:58.280 --> 59:00.320
and talking about them on your Twitter account

59:00.320 --> 59:04.040
is there are sometimes the typical, like,

59:04.040 --> 59:06.000
why didn't you just do this, noob?

59:06.000 --> 59:07.520
And then there's sometimes, like, people take it

59:07.520 --> 59:08.640
as a mentoring moment.

59:08.640 --> 59:11.120
And that seems to be the big difference.

59:11.120 --> 59:14.360
So strangely enough, this is actually the topic

59:14.360 --> 59:16.960
that I'm discussing in my talk at Linux Fest.

59:16.960 --> 59:19.440
And the name of my talk is, you know,

59:19.440 --> 59:22.320
strengthening your community by poisoning the well.

59:22.320 --> 59:24.120
And that's kind of been the way that I

59:24.120 --> 59:26.600
feel my entire journey in Linux has been,

59:26.600 --> 59:29.560
is I go out and I do something that I'm so proud of.

59:29.560 --> 59:31.760
Like, hey, I'm trying out this new OS.

59:31.760 --> 59:33.960
And I run into one little bug, and I go out

59:33.960 --> 59:36.720
and I ask for help, and all I get is, well, it's obvious.

59:36.720 --> 59:38.400
You ran into it because, you know,

59:38.400 --> 59:39.640
why aren't you using Arch?

59:39.640 --> 59:40.960
Why are you using KDE?

59:40.960 --> 59:43.200
It's always, why did you do this,

59:43.200 --> 59:45.600
instead of turning it around and going, OK, you know what?

59:45.600 --> 59:47.520
I haven't run into this issue.

59:47.520 --> 59:49.400
I feel that people are almost afraid to admit

59:49.400 --> 59:52.200
what they haven't experienced and what they don't know.

59:52.200 --> 59:54.080
So when I find those people, you know,

59:54.080 --> 59:56.720
I call them my Twitter family that turn around and go,

59:56.720 --> 59:58.720
I don't know, but I'll help you troubleshoot.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.560
Or I do know, I ran into this, you're not alone.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.640
I always jump on those experiences

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.240
because those are the people that I feel

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.600
are going to change the way this community is run.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:12.240
Yeah, and it is really like one opportunity at a time

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.440
to begin to change that.

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.440
Brent, I'd like to hear your experiences, too,

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.640
because I know you've been ramping up your Linux usage

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.520
for years now.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.600
Yeah, and before I get into that,

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.000
I have a question for Emma.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.320
Emma, is this kind of a new experience for you?

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.480
I'm assuming you were using Windows previously.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:32.120
Did you run into problems there?

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.640
And when you did, how was that process for you?

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.280
Switching was actually really easy.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.640
Like you guys were saying, people

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.080
can approach it as a mentor or a bully, really.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:46.760
And I had all my people at System76

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.480
showing me how to do things constantly,

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.160
never being negative about anything

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.960
or making me feel dumb.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.520
I always felt empowered after I switched.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:00.520
And I never missed Windows.

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.520
Not once.

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.760
Amen.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.400
And Elle, what about your experience?

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.120
So mine is a little bit different.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.840
I spent a majority of my time off the grid.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.240
So Linux was actually my first OS.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.320
I did not use Windows before I moved on to Linux.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.040
Wow.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.160
That is so awesome.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:20.520
It is really cool, yeah.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.200
And she went hardcore into the whole Red Hat route, too.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.320
And she could teach us a few things about RHEL.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:25.960
Let me tell you.

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:26.760
Oh, I bet.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.000
So I'm curious now to hear your story, Brent.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.040
Yeah, well, I, as many of us, kind of

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:35.320
went through lots of different operating systems,

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:38.200
from Windows doing photo stuff there,

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.240
and then moved to Mac OS doing photo stuff there

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.360
for many years, and then to Linux

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:45.880
just because I thought it could serve me a little bit better.

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.560
But I've been also, for many years,

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:53.760
helping other users move to Linux as well.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.240
And I find that the best approach

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.680
is to take a humble one, right?

01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:02.720
Just because I'm convinced that it's the best tool for me,

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.720
I know is not true, because I have these unique properties

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.360
about myself compared to, let's say,

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.160
my family or friends around me.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.360
I'm super curious.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.280
I've been dabbling with computers my entire life.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:16.960
And so I can't assume that the everyday computer

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.320
user is going to have any of those same properties.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.560
And so what I've noticed is really helpful

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.520
is trying to use empathy to approach it

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:26.400
from their direction.

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:30.520
So OK, my mom, for instance, uses her computer for email

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:34.880
and browsing Pinterest and things like that.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.840
These are not things I do, but OK, in this environment,

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.760
is this going to do what she needs

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.760
and just get out of her way, right?

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.560
So seeing the computer more as a tool and less like a hobby

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:48.000
really helped me to move people successfully

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.680
and on a path, a gentle path, that I can really enjoy as well.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:53.640
That makes sense.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.520
I'd be curious how you see photography

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.000
and audio seem like there's some parallels there.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.760
So I'd be curious, like, Linux certainly,

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.200
I mean, you use Linux for some of your professional things,

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.440
but how do you feel about recommending it

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.640
as the platform for photography?

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.640
Yeah, I think that's a really important question.

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.600
I see the chat room's asking that too.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.520
When I first started on Linux, I found

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:18.200
it was a little bit more in its infancy,

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.960
and that was started full time on Linux

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.600
doing all of my professional stuff,

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.560
so exclusively on Linux, I think, around 2012.

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.240
So it's wild.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.720
But I was watching Linux before then and the tools

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.240
and trying to see, so that's the moment where I decided, OK,

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.360
this has everything a user like me who's

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.960
fine with tinkering needs.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:43.080
And just last year, I gave a little bit of a talk

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.040
here at a MakersFest.

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.400
And when I gave that talk, the whole intention

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.840
was to show the photo tools on Linux

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:56.040
to try to encourage anyone to get access to them.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:59.320
And what the tools can do now, because they've

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.360
come a long way, is they break down the barrier of entry

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:05.160
to photography, so anyone with almost any computer

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:08.200
can get access to some really professional tools.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.440
And the really neat thing was that the class

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:13.880
was filled with people who showed up at the MakersFest,

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.280
so there were retired dads who were just dabbling

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.240
in photography as a pastime.

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.040
There were kids who were just trying to check everything out

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:22.720
just to play.

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:26.480
And so I ended up giving a talk to the most widespread user

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:30.800
base possible, and everybody caught on to it.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.880
So that, to me, really proved, OK, I'm showing dark table

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:37.760
and I'm showing five super simple aspects of it,

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:41.320
but it can really reach out to all of these users

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.360
if you present it in a way that's gentle

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:46.280
and has the right progression.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.080
And the kids caught on the fastest, which was great.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:53.080
So OK, someone who, I think they were like 10 or 11,

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.960
so I was like, OK, they can start at almost any age,

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:59.800
and that's a perfect age to start dabbling in creative arts.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.160
So photography is great, right?

01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:07.800
And but then the people who had way less computer experience

01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:11.000
also, after a little while and some pointers and stuff,

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:11.840
started picking up.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.800
So that, to me, was really the proof that, OK, photography

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.680
on Linux is there.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.180
And this every day, and I never have

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:20.880
to tinker with the photography software anymore.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:23.360
The things I'm tinkering with are more advanced.

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.800
And the photography, when I need to get to it,

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.520
I can just get to it, and it's a production machine for that.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:31.920
So I would say anybody in photography, at least,

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.040
it's a great time to move or at least try it.

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:37.200
Yeah, and it's more and more categories over time.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:40.200
Linux is a better and better tool for that.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.160
And I think, Brent, that was an amazing breakdown

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.760
of the things you need to do to evaluate, right?

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.120
You can't just assume it's going to work.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.640
You need to be practical about it.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.400
And the other thing is it demonstrates

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.480
what I think is maybe I would love

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.640
to be a key takeaway from this conversation

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:56.760
is show a successful workflow.

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:59.880
Demonstrate being successful at a task.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:03.880
And that can be the biggest sales pitch in itself,

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:04.720
right there.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.960
I think you really got to get this right.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:10.360
It's our responsibility, as experienced Linux users,

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:13.280
to sell this tool in a way where it can succeed.

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.680
I think, Wes, you were talking about it earlier in our chat.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.000
I just copied your quote here.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:17.820
This is great.

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:20.840
You said, it's about being honest about tooling.

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:23.760
And if you want the Linux experience to be good,

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.960
you need to recommend it in situations where it can succeed.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:28.880
Yeah, I mean, it's not fair to people

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.080
we recommend this to, to have to experiment and fight.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.320
And if they want that, OK.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.640
Or you can support them while they do that.

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:35.600
That's great.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.280
But that's not for everyone.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:40.720
So try to find situations where it's going to be a great fit.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:43.120
There are many, because Linux is great at many things.

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:46.120
Then you can earn some trust, and people open up after that.

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:46.760
Yeah.

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:47.480
Do you know what?

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.920
I think we got another soapbox in here.

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.800
Get that out of here.

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.160
Let's just get that out of here.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:53.560
All right, I know the mumble room has more to say.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.260
Maybe we'll carry it over to the post-show.

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:57.200
But I want to make that to be right there.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:59.200
I think that's the key message to drive home right there.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.360
We can continue the conversation in the post-show.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.840
But I think that's the takeaways, is as experienced

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.960
Linux users, we need to be good stewards.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.440
We need to get this right.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.640
I think Elle says it perfectly.

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:12.800
Sometimes you just have to be willing to admit to everyone

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.360
that Linux sucks sometimes, and it's OK.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.720
Perfect.

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:18.800
There you go.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.280
I love it.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.920
Most important free software project in the world, I say.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.440
At least in my opinion.

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.360
But make sure that when you recommend it,

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.480
it's going to succeed.

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.680
That's what you've got to do.

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:30.160
For the sake of everyone.

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.080
That's right.

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.080
All right, go get more Wes Payne over at TechSnap.

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:35.600
We talked about that earlier, TechSnap.Systems.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:36.760
He's also at Wes Payne.

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:40.600
I'm at Chris Elias, the network at Jupiter Signal.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.080
Man, we've got so much, really so many things to say now.

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:44.680
I guess we need a longer outro.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:45.160
Yeah, we do.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.560
But I'll just leave you with this.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:49.640
Join us a little early next week for that Ansible study group.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.360
I think that's going to be really valuable.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.360
So I think we'll just make that the final word.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:56.480
Oh, and of course, also, see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:56.980
Ah!

01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:25.800
Oh!

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:35.720
Hey, Unplugged Program, alright, Mr. Payne, we gotta get everybody to go over JB Titles.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.720
Go vote!

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:40.200
Now, exercise those voting rights we've given you.

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.560
So while everybody's voting on the titles, I know, I always plug at JBtitles.com, but

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.360
we gotta get a good title.

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:51.840
I wanna see what you guys think about NextDoc2, which promises to turn your smartphone into

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:52.840
a laptop.

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:56.960
It's a nice aluminum laptop filled with battery, so it charges your phone too.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:01.800
Big trackpad, nice keyboard, HD screen, and it works with a few of those Android devices

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:05.800
where you can plug it in and it extends to the device or like a Raspberry Pi.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.360
NextDoc doesn't only work with smartphones.

01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:14.160
With the full size HDMI in port, the new NextDoc still supports many PCs and Raspberry Pis,

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:17.800
creating fully functional computers at a revolutionarily low cost.

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:22.840
Thanks to the new USB Type-C port, we can also develop better integrated PC sticks so

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:27.560
that you can use NextDoc with the processor and operating system of your choice.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:32.640
Imagine an enduring, sustainable computer that you can simply upgrade and customize

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.540
as the years go by.

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:39.100
By separating processor and operating system from the physical interface, we hope to start

01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:43.400
a paradigm shift in consumer electronics, where computers can be adapted rather than

01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:47.920
becoming obsolete, generating less electronic waste for the environment.

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:51.640
So you can upgrade your smartphone and you still get the same screen, same battery, same

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:52.640
keyboard.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:55.840
I think the 90s are calling us back.

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:58.040
It does feel like history is repeating itself a little bit.

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.120
Well, it's got 754 backers with 24 days left to go.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:07.280
You know what also interests me about that is that back in the early days of the Raspberry

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:14.280
Pi Gen 1, a lot of people were using Motorola's old Laptop to do the same exact thing.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.640
It is actually kind of nice with a Raspberry Pi.

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.600
It is actually kind of nice.

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.840
I actually would like one of these for a Raspberry Pi.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:21.840
I don't know what the final price would be.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:25.520
What's the difference than attaching a nice keyboard and thing to your iPad?

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.400
I guess the flexibility here, because you can pick what you interface with.

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:30.400
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:33.960
And I guess the whole, like, it has USB-C and it works with the smartphones and supports

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:34.960
that too.

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:35.960
That is kind of nice.

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.280
I wish convergence ever becomes a thing.
