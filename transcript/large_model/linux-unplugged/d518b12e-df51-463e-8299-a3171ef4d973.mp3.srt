1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,640
You know who did that?

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,640
Noah did that.

3
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,000
Noah taped that mic cable to that monitor cable.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,400
Why is it not homed until now, though?

5
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,400
That's a good question.

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,680
It's all taped together with electrical tape.

7
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,680
Come on!

8
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:22,480
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,480
My name is Chris.

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,480
My name is Wes.

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,480
Hello, Wes.

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,480
Is that a homemade bearskin jacket?

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,480
I thought you'd be impressed.

14
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,640
That looks nice and toasty.

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,180
This episode is brought to you by the all new A Cloud Guru.

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,760
They are the leader in hands-on learning and the best way to learn a new skill, well, that's

17
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,760
by doing.

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,920
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs for cloud Linux servers and much more.

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,320
So get your hands cloudy at a cloud guru dot com.

20
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,920
Well, coming up on the show today, it is indeed an episode out of time.

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,840
As you're listening to this, Wes and I are off in the Arctic on a penguin photo walk

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,240
getting great action shots of some really delicious looking birds.

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,660
I'm a little scared about the polar bear situation, but I'm just going to not bring any meat.

24
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,940
I think, well, that bear jacket smells like meat, so you better think about that one.

25
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,560
We asked you to send in your questions, though, so that way we'd have an episode for you

26
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,880
while we are out and about taking photos and eating penguins.

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,440
So in this episode, we're going to answer as many of those as possible.

28
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,200
We are not going to get to all of them, though, but we're going to get to as many as we can.

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,120
So I think in the future, we'll either do these in batches or we'll do another episode

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
down the road.

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,160
So if you hear something and or you you didn't hear your question asked, it could still be

32
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,160
pending.

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,720
And you all also, if you didn't get one in yet, you still have a chance at ask up dot

34
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
com.

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,340
We'll do that on a future episode.

36
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,680
But before we get into all of that, we got to say hello to our virtual log time, appropriate

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
greetings, mobile room.

38
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,680
Hello.

39
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,680
Hello, everybody.

40
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
Hello.

41
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,680
Happy Sunday.

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:56,000
Thanks for letting us crash the luck today and and hang out and, you know, do a podcast.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,240
It's pretty awesome.

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,240
So what do you say?

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,800
Should we get into this huge, huge batch that we got here?

46
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,720
Last week, we're like, let's hold off on Bill's question and let's answer it next week in

47
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
our episode.

48
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,080
So why don't we start with Bill's?

49
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
All right.

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,080
Yeah.

51
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,520
Bill wrote in to us and this is a deep one just to start things off today.

52
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,160
I'm writing as I wonder about the relationship between the Linux community and the Mac and

53
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,040
PC platforms and how that relationship is formed.

54
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,920
I think the Linux communities are quite alerted by anything Microsoft or Windows does.

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,560
And this attitude can be seen in the recent discussion about WSLG as it just being a gateway

56
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,080
so that people don't have to use Linux or I think really, you know, Bill speaking to

57
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,240
some of our concerns about well, this really makes it easy and it takes a lot of the stuff

58
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,400
that we kind of had uniquely in our camp before.

59
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,400
Yeah.

60
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
I think Bill's picking up on that.

61
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,760
We seem to have a little bit more of an alarm reaction when Microsoft does something than

62
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,960
when Apple does something.

63
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Right.

64
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,120
And kind of the, you know, just how we support things like he quotes you saying that we should

65
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,400
really kind of try to, you know, rather than buy something preloaded with Windows, try

66
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,000
to support folks that are supporting Linux natively on their hardware where possible.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,400
And that's sort of a, you know, just avoid all the Microsoft stuff if you can.

68
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,240
And there's definitely that sentiment out there too.

69
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,980
I think, you know, you have to acknowledge there's a history with Microsoft when it comes

70
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:16,600
specifically to Linux and free software that has shaded the way people view some of Microsoft's

71
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,680
current actions.

72
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:26,360
Because in a real way, Microsoft's past sort of modus operandus was embrace and extend.

73
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,120
And so when they came into open source and started participating in a pretty significant

74
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,400
way, it really looked like embrace and extend to a lot of people for a long time.

75
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Yeah.

76
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Yeah.

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
No, I think that's fair.

78
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,360
So Bill's also kind of wondering, why aren't we more worried about Apple?

79
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,520
And I think this was complicated for a lot of reasons, especially just because this question

80
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,320
keeps changing depending on like what five year period you want to pick here and like

81
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,560
what are the relationships and what are they investing in and how does that work for the

82
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,880
groups we're concerned about.

83
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,800
But Bill's kind of got three main high level reasons.

84
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,520
Apple's hardware is usually pretty darn closed, and they're not so friendly with the open

85
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,980
source efforts to port things onto their systems.

86
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,440
And number two, Apple has not been as friendly to the Linux and FOSS community.

87
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,680
This is another one of those things that has changed, I think, for both Microsoft and Apple

88
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,160
considerably over the years.

89
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,880
But while they have contributed some of the underpinnings, things like cups, stuff like

90
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,560
that, but you don't see a lot of any of their new shiny products.

91
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,800
None of those, there's no Linux version of Messenger or anything like that, right?

92
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Or iMessage.

93
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Yeah.

94
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,620
No, I'd say Apple's contributions are lower level.

95
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,080
They're more like things like WebKit or some of the individual user land tools themselves.

96
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
Right.

97
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,560
So if you compare that to like.NET or PowerShell or even just running MS SQL on Linux, VS code.

98
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Sure.

99
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Yeah, absolutely.

100
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,560
Yeah.

101
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,200
And then number three, number three, I think, due to its similar design, macOS can also

102
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,500
attract many target users of desktop Linux.

103
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,500
And this is the one I know has been bugging you in the back of your brain lately, at least

104
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,320
with that shiny new M1 hardware.

105
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,580
Yeah, it's not without some compromise, though, right?

106
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,160
That's where I think Bill and I see things a little differently.

107
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,360
To me, WSL represents a more direct threat to Linux because it's actually the Linux user

108
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,840
environment and you can actually build Linux applications on Windows using WSL and Microsoft

109
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,920
provides tools to allow you to create Linux applications all day long from the Windows

110
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
10 desktop.

111
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,960
And they've created documentation around that as well.

112
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,480
And they have developer advocates that are helping people accomplish that.

113
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,000
I mean, it's it's a much more direct assault at what desktop Linux is used for.

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,120
And assault is a very extreme term here.

115
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,640
It's really just about enabling their existing users and enterprise customers to create applications

116
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
for the Linux platform.

117
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,260
But with Macintosh macOS, it's not like Linux.

118
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,000
It's not as nice to run Docker on there.

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,160
It's not as nice to develop Linux applications.

120
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,480
It absolutely can be done, especially when things are, you know, Ruby and Python and

121
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,560
Rust even.

122
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
But you know, it's not.

123
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Oh, yeah.

124
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,560
OK.

125
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Thanks, Wes.

126
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Thanks.

127
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,560
Hey, you know, Java runs there, too.

128
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,560
OK.

129
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,360
But it's not the same.

130
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,500
And the Mac environment is more constrained.

131
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,160
You're going to be more dependent on virtualization, especially now on the M1 platform.

132
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,240
So while it is absolutely an appealing platform to a lot of people and they'll be motivated

133
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,680
to make those compromises, it's not, I don't think, a one to one like it is with Windows

134
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,680
and WSL.

135
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,280
And also, you know, there's just the size factor like Microsoft is so dominant.

136
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,480
And I think we talk a lot about Apple, but that's just because it's in our space, right?

137
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,320
It is for people that are have enough money or are willing to spend a lot of their budget

138
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,720
on computing devices or also folks who are maybe developers or sys admins are in this

139
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,600
camp where that's kind of one of the tools of the trade.

140
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,000
But Microsoft is this big enterprise imposed system and they dominated so much of the desktop

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
market.

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,440
I do think this has changed in that now Apple controls how much of like the, you know, the

143
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,920
USA phone market with their mobile platform, but the Linux community is much more attached

144
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
to the desktop sphere.

145
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,000
So I don't think we're as, I mean, we are threatened by it.

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,840
Obviously there's a lot of developments in the Linux phone systems and where you have

147
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,320
complicated feelings about Android, but it hasn't really tainted us in that same way.

148
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,420
Mac sales right now are going crazy for the last three quarters.

149
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,880
And since the M1 was announced, they have just skyrocketed.

150
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,280
And according to Apple in their, according to Tim Cook in their latest quarterly results,

151
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,960
50% of Mac buyers are first time Mac buyers right now.

152
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
Oh, interesting.

153
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
Yeah.

154
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,360
But they're, they're not going after Linux.

155
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,000
We mean, Apple's really going after windows.

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,160
They, they, they're not targeting the Linux desktop where Microsoft kind of is with WSL

157
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,760
and WSLG specifically.

158
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,520
But I do think that we could have a serious reckoning that could come to the Linux community

159
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,840
where we're going to have a bunch of geeks and technical people that have chosen that

160
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,820
platform and they're going to want to participate in the same communities that we participated,

161
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:56,880
just like we're going to have people who are entering the free software world via the WSL

162
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,640
subsystem lens.

163
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,560
You're going to have people on these M1 and M1X and M2 Macintoshes, and they're going

164
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,040
to want to participate in some of the free software communities that we, we also travel

165
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,040
in.

166
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
Yeah.

167
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,220
I mean, in both ways, it's in both contributions and just, you know, folks that are using those

168
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,700
for development, but also in, you see a lot of projects working on support for this new

169
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
platform.

170
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,060
And that kind of just shows you that like, okay, we're taking this seriously because

171
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,920
we have a user base that needs us to.

172
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,080
So there you go, Bill, that is kind of why we, we take them both seriously, but the windows

173
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,120
seems to be a little bit more of a probably pressing concern.

174
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,840
And it's mostly just a concern of disincentivizing people to switch to Linux.

175
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,440
However, I've been thinking on this issue a lot and, you know, I think back to the good

176
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:48,280
old days, pre Ubuntu and I just good old days, loosely pre Ubuntu and what a weird landscape

177
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:54,480
the Linux desktop was and how in my day job, I was always managing windows systems for

178
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,960
the longest time, but I would still go home at night and play around with Gentoo.

179
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:04,240
And it truly was a drive for the love of the technology and the thing that it was doing.

180
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,920
And then it then later became about the social message and the community around it.

181
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,620
And so those things are still there today.

182
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,840
And I think they still appealing to people who are on windows and Mac OS that are looking

183
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,040
for something a little more engaging.

184
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,320
And a little more intellectually entertaining because it's, it can be kind of a toy too.

185
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,720
Yeah, that's the for good and bad, right?

186
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,560
Like I think a lot of folks get into points in their career or maybe they have, they have

187
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
less free time.

188
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,520
They have a family, they have a really demanding job where they want a platform that just works

189
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
for them.

190
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,120
And that's often what you hear from folks that like desktop Linux, but are on the Mac

191
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,400
or windows situation.

192
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm not here to argue that desktop Linux can't just work because I think, I think it can,

193
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,560
but it depends on your workflow and what you're comfortable with and where you want to spend

194
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
your time.

195
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,640
And the flip side of that is if you just want to have a computer to have fun or you can

196
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:55,480
mess with anything, change anything, recompile your kernel, change how the software works,

197
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
that's the Linux desktop.

198
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,800
And it's pretty darn awesome.

199
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,520
Well, we were having a chat recently, you know, you had a work Mac that you were on

200
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,120
and it's not like you were paying close attention to it because it's not like, it's not your,

201
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
not your main machine.

202
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,160
I didn't shell out the several thousand dollars for it.

203
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
Yeah.

204
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,600
And you don't really think because when you, so when you don't actively buy this machine,

205
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,400
you don't really kind of, you're not really kind of paying attention to how the culture

206
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,100
of the OS works and all of that.

207
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,280
So you rebooted the other day and then came back to your machine and it was like, well,

208
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,040
I guess I have to burn 30 minutes now because it's just sitting here installing updates.

209
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,840
And you and I then had a conversation from that about how, what appeals to us about using

210
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,440
Linux as a workstation is those kinds of things are under our control.

211
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
Right.

212
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,360
It doesn't do a lot without me telling it to do it.

213
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,520
And that means if I need to walk back to that and use it for work during my work day, like

214
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,360
my machines available to me.

215
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,460
That's the difference.

216
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,880
If you were to go, if you were to go out of the computer world and you were to think about

217
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,760
this in terms of tools or vehicles, that's the difference between a work tool and a consumer

218
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,200
tool is those little kinds of control.

219
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
Right.

220
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,820
But it also kind of reminds me in some ways of say like owning versus renting a house

221
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,080
is you get the control, but you also become responsible for it.

222
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
True.

223
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,600
Like in a way that, I mean, maybe not on the most sort of like well polished LTS desktops

224
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,680
or something, but generally if something breaks, you're going to have to figure it out and

225
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,000
there's not going to be as much support.

226
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,600
That is a great counterpoint to it, but that's, that's the sort of balance that I'm more comfortable

227
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
with.

228
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Yeah.

229
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Yeah, exactly.

230
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
And it works for that and it is getting better.

231
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,000
I mean, we should acknowledge that the degree for the things that, which that happens and

232
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,920
how often and how difficult it is to remedy, that definitely improves over the years.

233
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,520
And it seems like it, you know, with things like protons, I, that keeps happening.

234
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
True.

235
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
True.

236
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
All right.

237
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
Well, yet Linux writes in with a quickie.

238
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,440
He says, what's your take for both of you on voice controlled digital assistants like

239
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,160
the Echos or the Mycrofts?

240
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,120
Do you use them in your home or the JB one studio?

241
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
Curious.

242
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,360
Wes, what's, what's your take on the voice assistants?

243
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Yeah.

244
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,560
I'll leave the studio one to you over there.

245
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,880
Um, yeah, I don't love them.

246
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,520
They're not a huge part of my life, but I do have a pixel as my phone.

247
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,480
So I've already kind of got Google assistant there and I'm, I'm certainly not, not going

248
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,100
to use it to say to, uh, go open VLC, which I did earlier today when I was driving up

249
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,800
to the studio.

250
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,560
At home, I do a lot of things with Chromecast.

251
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,800
So at the moment I do have some Google homes.

252
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,440
I really, I don't use them for a lot of things.

253
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,760
It's mostly for like my media devices, stopping, going back, like it's much easier to ask it

254
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,160
to rewind for two minutes than it is to pull up my phone.

255
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,960
Maybe you have to do the fingerprint thing, open, go back to the app that it was playing

256
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
that media in.

257
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,240
And then hopefully it has a decent size scroll bar.

258
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,160
That's actually like, you can actually drag with your thumb decently.

259
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
That's so frustrating.

260
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,640
I did used to have one of the Amazon devices up for a while, but at that point, really,

261
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,360
I just used it to play like a live radio stream.

262
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,280
And I, now I just do that on the Chromecast.

263
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:50,280
So I don't have like this super strong paranoia about these things because I have used them

264
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:56,320
in the past and I've watched them from a network standpoint and like, you know, is it really,

265
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,420
is it really only communicating when I use the, you know, wake word and besides a few

266
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,000
heartbeat things here and there and like update checks, it basically truly is not transmitting.

267
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Right.

268
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,400
There are other like legitimate ways that they are using and taking and analyzing information

269
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,040
that we're not comfortable with that.

270
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
That particular one.

271
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
I am not that worried about.

272
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Yeah.

273
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,840
All these companies have all these other ways to mine our lives.

274
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,200
They really don't need to hear me farting in my house.

275
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,800
But so what I have done is I've used the studio as a testing ground and then what kind of

276
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,580
passes my my sniff test then gets graduated to lady jupes.

277
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,320
And that's been true for a lot of smart home technology.

278
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,260
So for a while we had a Siri tube, an echo tube and a Google tube in the studio as I

279
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,260
tested them.

280
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,620
Just try to get an idea.

281
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,920
Is this something we should be following as a network?

282
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,720
Is this something that really is as bad as people say it is and are these something that

283
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,720
provide value?

284
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,200
And then over time I kind of whittled it down and I know this is going to seem like a crazy

285
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,500
take from a Linux guy, but I got to say it really is true.

286
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,960
The one that I find the the most appealing is the Siri one, the Siri tube from Apple.

287
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,560
If you're going to use one of these things now, I'm going to say I'm not saying you should

288
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,020
use one of these things, just making a point that if you are, if you are going to use one

289
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:17,440
of these things, the Siri tube tries to do everything on your land that it can.

290
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,320
So its first move is LAN.

291
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,060
So if it's smart control, it's a LAN packet.

292
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,520
It's not an API that triggers through a cloud provider.

293
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,520
If it's streaming audio from a mobile device, it's over the LAN.

294
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,840
It's not going through the cloud.

295
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,920
It's interesting how the incentives work there, right?

296
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,400
Like you can imagine being a developer at Google where it's like, well, you're architected

297
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,760
where you just assume you rely so heavily on that.

298
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,300
But I can also imagine on the Apple side, like, well, what's going to, what's going

299
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,020
to do, I mean, even putting aside privacy for a moment, what's going to be the snappiest

300
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,720
behavior for our consumer?

301
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
And it's that.

302
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,320
Yeah, that definitely is the fastest in that regard.

303
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,140
But all of them require cloud connectivity for voice recognition.

304
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,140
And that's a bummer.

305
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,140
Right.

306
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,140
That's just no good.

307
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,320
And that's where I am hopeful that maybe something like Mycroft will come along because it is

308
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,680
really nice.

309
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,080
There is functionality when you're coming into a home, your hands are full of groceries.

310
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
It's dark.

311
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
You need some lights.

312
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
It's really nice.

313
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:17,540
The other thing that I love is I have a different routines for morning and nighttime.

314
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,640
So we say, you know, hey, tube, it's last call.

315
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,480
And when we say it's last call, it triggers a series of scripts that I have on Home Assistant

316
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,120
that trigger sort of a gradual shutdown of the home.

317
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,280
Lights slowly begin to fade out and shut down.

318
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,480
Noisemakers come on, white noisemakers come on, kind of sending a signal that has trained

319
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
everyone, including the dog, that it's bedtime.

320
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
Beautiful.

321
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,880
And you know, you've got a 20 minute window to go to bed once this process starts.

322
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,880
Brush your teeth.

323
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Yeah.

324
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,780
And then we have a good morning process that sort of reverses that.

325
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:54,240
And it kind of turns off the noisemakers, turns things on, sort of lights things up,

326
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,160
depending on if the sun has risen or not, and that I like being able to initiate those

327
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,560
things by just invoking it from the air.

328
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,040
Yeah, I really appreciate that.

329
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,880
One thing I don't like about that, relying on the on the voice stuff, which is very handy,

330
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,920
and I think is an interesting phase of technological development to watch and change how we interface

331
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,680
with with computers.

332
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,740
But the downside of having to be these sort of proprietary platforms that I don't have

333
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,720
any insight or control into is often I'll have some like sort of quiet music similar

334
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,400
to you like, you know, bedtime phase kind of cool things down before I get in bed, walk

335
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,620
upstairs and it's nice to just sort of yell at the tube to say like, hey, turn things

336
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,520
off now.

337
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,480
That doesn't work after like midnight recently, it'll even it'll even on my phone, it'll prompt

338
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,480
me with the like, I've recognized you've asked me to do this a lot.

339
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,480
Here's a button you can click.

340
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,900
So you don't even have to talk.

341
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,400
But then it won't do the action.

342
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,040
And it just reminds a good constant reminder of like, okay, you're relying on this, but

343
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,340
don't rely on it too much.

344
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,880
And that's when I go to the open source app that can like turn my TV off and stuff.

345
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,460
I find the Google one when I was testing these pretty regularly did have the most variance

346
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,020
in it would recognize something for a while and then at some point it would just stop

347
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,600
recognizing it.

348
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,500
And the nice thing about the Siri tube, and this is my last time I'll bring this up, is

349
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:12,960
it talks over home kit directly to home assistant, which is my home automation software.

350
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,800
So it's over the LAN talking to my home assistant.

351
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,860
So anything I make like a button or a script, or like a temperature sensor, anything I put

352
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:27,280
in home assistant, I can have the tube get or control.

353
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
And it's really great.

354
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,840
And I don't have there's no API, Apple's not involved at all.

355
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,400
It's all over my LAN.

356
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,840
I like it a lot like that.

357
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,860
But I think ultimately, I'm really going to be looking for something where I can process

358
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,680
everything 100% on my LAN, including the voice recognition.

359
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,440
And I think that's going to be hopefully my craft, but we shall see.

360
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,400
One of those, like many things in Linux and open source, just sort of wait, check in every

361
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,140
couple of months or years and see where the project's at.

362
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,920
My setup too is a little bit beyond, I'm not trying to brag, I have like all kinds of automation

363
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,920
and pretty much everything is controlled by my home assistant in my home.

364
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,240
So I had to come up with a family friendly interface to that.

365
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,560
I couldn't expect them to open up the home assistant app on their devices all the time.

366
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,240
It's almost like you're into this enough to have a whole show about it.

367
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,680
You want to take our next email from somebody in our back of the woods, right here in Puget

368
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Sound.

369
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Yeah.

370
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:25,520
I've been obsessing over the idea of solar storms knocking out power grids and decided

371
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,380
to store some hardware just in case.

372
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:34,920
What would be your ideal setup for running a battery powered LAN, client devices and

373
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,400
media storage?

374
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,440
Well, I think you are pretty well equipped to handle this one there, Mr. Chris.

375
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,840
I mean, that's tricky though.

376
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
Like what do you do?

377
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,200
Like how do you, you could really drive yourself crazy worrying about a solar storm.

378
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,200
What's weird about this is I just saw a news article recapping something that happened,

379
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,440
I think in the 1920s or somewhere.

380
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
Oh yeah.

381
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,040
The last, the last solar storm.

382
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Yeah.

383
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,240
It was like the telegraphs caught on fire and stuff like equipment actually caught fire.

384
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
Yeah.

385
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,180
That's kind of, there's like two parts of this question is like, are you worried about

386
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,040
shielding your existing equipment?

387
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,400
Because then, I mean, you need either a lot of shielding on it or some sort of like Faraday

388
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,440
basement cage set up in your, in your, in your house.

389
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,980
After that, so you've got your equipment to survive.

390
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,240
You know, I, I think what I'm going to, that's my charitable pronunciation.

391
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
Whoa, whoa.

392
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
Whoa.

393
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,240
Yeah.

394
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
It's whoa.

395
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,240
Whoa.

396
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,520
Already has a raspberry PI four set up with sync thing and Samba as well as an Android

397
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,020
device and a raspberry PI 400.

398
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,480
So you know, there's some starts here, but like what are essential services and how do

399
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,160
you, raspberry PI's are probably a good start, but how do you manage whatever power you've

400
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
got?

401
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,200
So one thing I've been thinking recently is a couple of lithium ion batteries.

402
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,400
I'd love something like Battle Born batteries.

403
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:55,080
You can go look those up, but smaller, but something like two Battle Born batteries in

404
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:02,040
a Pelican case with a raspberry PI, with a switch, with some discs.

405
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
Are you following me here?

406
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:07,040
Like a Pelican case ready to go, like a go case of a battery go box.

407
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
Yeah.

408
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Yeah.

409
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,560
You could put a converter in there and maybe like a plug on the outside that was sealed

410
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,360
up with some like sort of grommet that way you could actually charge the batteries too.

411
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,700
This is where I go with something like this and then I'd want something that I could fit

412
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,980
like in the back seat of my car so it can be too big.

413
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,080
And I think all of that would be pretty doable if you're using a raspberry PI because that's,

414
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,940
you know, minimal and you could just stick that to the inside of the, of the Pelican

415
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,940
case.

416
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,160
That'd be awesome.

417
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,260
And I guess what you'd, I mean, you'd have to be relying on something like solar unless

418
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,480
you had access to a hydro or similar.

419
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Yeah.

420
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,200
And you'd also want to have a MiFi with some connectivity.

421
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,800
I'd probably want to go with something like a Ting plan or a Google Fi plan where I could

422
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,800
have data available to me if I needed it, but otherwise wasn't paying a big premium

423
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,480
when I wasn't using it because you're going to need connectivity for sure.

424
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,520
I'd love to hear what the audience, if you guys have any ideas out there, send it into

425
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,080
us because that would be an interesting project just to build something like that, a Linux

426
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,440
powered land that's disaster proof.

427
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,720
Can you get portable Faraday cages?

428
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,520
Cause that'd be even better if you could store it in some kind of Faraday cage.

429
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
So it's like,

430
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,680
you can pack it out of there once you need to and set it all up.

431
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,880
Everything's like your real gear might be fried.

432
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,100
Your regular gear is all fried, but your stuff in your Faraday cage is all preserved.

433
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,040
Also Bo said something here that it really kind of touched me.

434
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,080
He said, I just love Linux unplugged.

435
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,240
I got to join the very first show with my baby son sitting on my lap.

436
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,760
He's eight years old now.

437
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,760
What?

438
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
Isn't that awesome?

439
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,880
That's so cool.

440
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,040
And I know I sometimes think about our shows in the age of my kids.

441
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,320
It's pretty, it's pretty, it's pretty wild.

442
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,700
And yeah, let us know what you think for blow there.

443
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,080
How would you build a land that's ready to go after a solar storm?

444
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,280
And what I'm also kind of curious as a second aspect, like what, what are the essential

445
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
services you need on that?

446
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,400
Well, you know, for us, if we were going to do it, it would be like the podcast continuity

447
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
box, right?

448
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
Oh yeah.

449
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Yeah.

450
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
So they should have that.

451
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
We should.

452
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,960
We should be able to do it so that it could withstand a solar storm that after the new

453
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,520
society is going to need some content and we might as well get them started with Linux.

454
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,520
Well, they bet the new society better use Linux.

455
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,520
Let's be honest.

456
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,720
Let's not, let's not screw that up and we need to do our part.

457
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,720
All right.

458
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,320
So Joe from Pittsburgh writes and he says, are you guys using Nebula at all in your infrastructure?

459
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,120
I started using it a bit after it was first mentioned on the flat network truthers episode.

460
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
And you know what?

461
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,160
I've loved the experience for the most part, a new release came out recently and I submitted

462
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,240
a bug for it and everything seems to be pretty nice for the most part.

463
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,240
Thanks Joe.

464
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,240
That's awkward.

465
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,240
Well, it's a mixed question.

466
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,240
I'm still using it, but I don't think you are.

467
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,880
No, I mean, I really, I really thought I would.

468
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,920
I really thought that's how I was going to solve the carrier grade net thing, but I just

469
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:55,480
had a little bit of too much trouble with it behind the double grade mutant net.

470
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,540
And so I just kind of threw in the towel and said, you know, I'm just going to wire guard

471
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,480
out and just call it good.

472
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,480
But it has crossed my mind from time to time, especially like some sort of hybrid setup

473
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,920
with like the studio and a couple of rigs up at Leno.

474
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,920
Like that could be really cool.

475
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Yeah.

476
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,600
That's where I think it really makes a lot of sense is if you can just drop it on all

477
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,880
your devices and have it ready to go.

478
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,640
And we do have some wire guards set up specifically, especially for if we're doing like fancy audio

479
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,120
routing network stuff.

480
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,400
But as just another way from a trusted network to get into the studio, Nebula works really

481
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,600
great and I think it is still running on fake news.

482
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Yeah, maybe I should do it again.

483
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,600
I give it a go.

484
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,840
So for people who don't remember, it was a really neat new VPN that kind of branched

485
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,680
out from the Slack folks and it creates a peer to peer VPN mesh network that can create

486
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,200
essentially a flat network across maybe multiple cloud providers or multiple lands of your

487
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
own.

488
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Right.

489
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Something that, you know, you can just assume every device is also on this network and it

490
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,320
can bridge through over whatever actual land or coffee shop Wi-Fi it happens to be on.

491
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,280
But it's got some nice sort of modern features where you can have multiple groups and control

492
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,280
access.

493
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,560
So like, oh, I'm a user over here in the staff group, I need to see the front of house servers,

494
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,360
but I really don't need to see the, you know, the backup server over there.

495
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,200
You can handle all that natively, which is nice.

496
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
I really appreciate that, actually.

497
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,500
The next one comes in from Clemens and he's asking us a question that I think I know the

498
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,940
answer to.

499
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,140
So let me bounce it off you and see if I got it right.

500
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,400
He's having this problem when he's using his headset during video calls.

501
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,480
It sounds like the crappiest audio ever, you know, like the low quality Bluetooth audio

502
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,900
codec stuff.

503
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,440
And he's wondering what he could do if he could replace his headset or do something

504
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,120
to prevent that from happening.

505
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,000
And you're going to say switch to PipeWire.

506
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I was going to say switch to PipeWire.

507
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh, really?

508
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,240
I thought you were going to pitch your whole don't use Bluetooth at all.

509
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,240
Use my, you know, use right here.

510
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,120
Yeah, that was going to be my, if you said no, Chris, the switch to PipeWire, because

511
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
he's on 2004.

512
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
He's on Ubuntu 2004.

513
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
You can do PipeWire in 2004.

514
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,120
I mean, it's worth a shot.

515
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,120
Yeah, it might be.

516
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
Take a backup first.

517
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,760
If you're not comfortable fucking with your sound system.

518
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
Who is though?

519
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Like, that's the problem.

520
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
Who is?

521
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,760
Nobody is.

522
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,640
You know, like, so my thing is, like, does he risk that?

523
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,080
Or does he just go get the like the Corsair RF headset, which the reason why Wes give

524
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,780
me a hard time is because this is always my answer.

525
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,380
But the thing is, it does just totally bypass Bluetooth.

526
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:20,400
It's like, you know, those old like self old wireless phones you have around your house,

527
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,480
like 900 megahertz phones or whatever they were.

528
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
It's like that.

529
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,480
It's like RF.

530
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,920
It's good old RF.

531
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,800
And what it's RF that goes into a standard USB audio codec that Linux has drivers for

532
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,120
that looks like it's an always there sound card.

533
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,760
And the reason why that matters, and then I'm going to stop talking about it, but the

534
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,240
reason why that matters is if the sound card is persistent, then your video conferencing

535
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,720
software doesn't get confused because the sound devices are changing all the time.

536
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,000
That sound device is always there.

537
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's always available.

538
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,680
And then you just turn the physical power on the headset when you actually want it to

539
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,680
work.

540
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,560
And in the case of the Corsairs that I like, you can flip the mic up and it mutes it and

541
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,040
you flip the mic down and it's unmuted.

542
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,040
I like that, too.

543
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,920
Now, you can do some fiddling with pulse audio and Bluetooth, but it's not particularly fun.

544
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:07,140
And at least according to Neil, sounds like 2004 package version of PipeWire is pretty

545
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,140
darn old.

546
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,960
So if you're going to do that route, you'd probably have to go compile it yourself, which

547
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,300
is a whole other ask.

548
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:18,240
So if new hardware is in the boat, sounds like that might be the simplest option because

549
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,320
Bluetooth just didn't work out great.

550
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,040
Linode dot com slash unplugged.

551
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,680
Go there to get one hundred dollars in 60 day credit and you go there to support the

552
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
show.

553
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
I mean, the hundred dollars.

554
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
I suppose that's nice.

555
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
I suppose.

556
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
But I mean, you know, supporting the show.

557
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
That's great.

558
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,000
Linode is our hosting provider of choice.

559
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,200
Everything I've built in the last couple of years, I've chose Linode.

560
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,160
And for a bit, I was like Mr. Skeptic Pants.

561
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
I really was.

562
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,160
I shopped.

563
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,640
And every single time Linode came up above the rest.

564
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,100
And unlike entry level hosting providers or big cloud over at AWS, they don't try to tie

565
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,040
your hands and lock you down.

566
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,920
Linode gives you tools that are great and they really let you get the most out of their

567
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,280
crazy fast systems.

568
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,920
And when people ask me, Chris, why Linode?

569
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,880
There's so many choices, Chris, I say because it's fast, because they support Linux and

570
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,520
because they've been around since 2003.

571
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,760
They're not some crazy VC funded company that has to go big or go bust.

572
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:21,960
And they watch this stuff and built accordingly and have focused on that one thing in what

573
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,160
is essentially forever, because like 2003 is basically like forever.

574
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,220
I don't even know how they did it, because in 2003, I was struggling to keep a job because

575
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,560
the dot com boom had gone bust.

576
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:40,600
And somehow they got rolling and they built out a fantastic network, 11 data centers worldwide,

577
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,640
MVME super fast drives, SSD speeds that are going to, you know what, you go benchmark

578
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,320
them with that $100, you're going to see they're going to blow you away.

579
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,280
And a dashboard for days that's easy to manage and has power options that are just a few

580
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
clicks away.

581
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,040
And, you know, Wes is always going on about the fact that Linode has great tutorials so

582
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,960
he can sound really educated by reading everything Linode has written.

583
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
I don't have to prepare at all.

584
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,960
No.

585
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,960
I just go check out their articles.

586
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
Makes it sound like pros.

587
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,440
How do you think I got a job?

588
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,120
So anyways, go over to Linode and try it out.

589
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,680
You can build yourself a $5 rig or get something just custom to just what your workload is.

590
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,800
Like we we built ourselves something kind of nice for our matrix server.

591
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,040
I'm really proud of it.

592
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,080
And we take advantage of Linode's object storage for our next cloud back end instance and for

593
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,900
our peer to back end instance as well.

594
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,920
It's a great way when you think you're going to have storage that's a little unpredictable.

595
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,960
Object storage can be a fantastic way to run that.

596
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,080
Or if you need a static website for a portfolio or maybe a blog, you want it to look super

597
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,880
pro and fast, go check out what they have to offer.

598
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,080
So get started by going to Linode dot com slash unplugged.

599
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,840
Get that $100 for your new account and try all this stuff out.

600
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,680
There's a lot of ways to host something and a lot of various companies that'll do it for

601
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
you.

602
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,800
But none of them, none of them check all the boxes like Linode.

603
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,400
Linode dot com slash unplugged.

604
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,440
Oh, a little housekeeping time.

605
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,740
Great idea.

606
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,840
Great idea.

607
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,480
Did you know that we have the Luplug on Sundays and every now and then this show pops in.

608
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,520
Drink some cider and takes over the place.

609
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,920
Sneaky devils.

610
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,160
The Luplug happens every Sunday over at our mumble room.

611
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,520
It's not a weird thing.

612
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,620
It's not some algo social media hangout site.

613
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,620
It's mumble.

614
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,520
It's free software and it's happening right in our lobby.

615
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,520
So head over there.

616
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,720
You can get info at Linux unplugged dot com slash mumble.

617
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:32,120
Hey, also little update on the Jupiter broadcasting garage sale while I'm gone, you know, out

618
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:36,920
hunting, I mean, taking photos of penguins, we're going to get some new items in stock.

619
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,480
Some really cool stuff.

620
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,120
New stuff for the swag bags, going to upgrade the swag bags, get a new new batch of stuff.

621
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,200
Very excited about it.

622
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,640
And I should have proof copies on Monday of what I'm thinking about doing.

623
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,460
And if I like them, I'm going to place the order.

624
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,760
So when we get back from our penguin expedition, we'll have these ready to send out.

625
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,280
So I'll have an update for you on that.

626
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,080
And thank you, everybody, who's grabbed something over there at the Jupiter garage.

627
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,200
Been a huge success.

628
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,900
And it's also been a ton of stuff that we have learned and are still learning.

629
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,960
And I really appreciate you helping us do that.

630
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,480
And that, Wes, is all the cleaning.

631
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,120
So let's get back to the questions.

632
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,720
Eric from San Diego writes, I'm still relatively new to Linux, and I've got several Linux machines

633
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:26,280
at home, including the ThinkPad, too many Raspberry Pis, amen, Eric, and an old laptop

634
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,360
I brought back from the dead using Lubuntu.

635
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:36,240
My question is, how does one go about checking the open source code of a program?

636
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,120
Hmm, you want to do a little auditing, hey, Eric?

637
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,920
Well, Wes, you got any tips for him?

638
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,160
Because I'm not sure how to answer this one without saying it depends.

639
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,520
Well, it does depend.

640
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,360
You know, there's a lot of stuff now on GitHub for better or worse, depending on how you

641
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,920
feel about Microsoft and GitHub and large proprietary SaaS platforms.

642
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:01,320
But it's pretty much a one stop shop for a lot of things open source, even when it's

643
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,120
not the canonical repo where everything's actually developed.

644
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,180
A lot of projects mirror stuff over there.

645
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:11,160
So it's a good place to get started if you're just looking for general open source stuff.

646
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,820
Now for your particular distro, that's where it also gets more complicated because they've

647
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,240
got their own systems in place, but they definitely have something.

648
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,280
It might not be as discoverable as GitHub is, and it will depend on the distro.

649
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,360
And that's where you might go reach out, go join a, you know, a matrix chat and IRC chat

650
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,020
and ask about the stuff because, you know, you can go download the packages.

651
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,800
But if you want to go find the repo where it's kept, that'll depend.

652
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,400
But there will be people happy to point you in the right direction.

653
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,400
Hmm.

654
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
I like where your head's at, Eric.

655
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,600
That's a great, that's a great thing to be thinking about.

656
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,000
And it's something that we don't take as much advantage of as we could.

657
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,520
We like to claim the benefits of it, right?

658
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,380
We love to say that it's open source and all the things.

659
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,720
But how many packages that you install have you actually looked at the code for?

660
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,840
Mm hmm, something about eyeballs.

661
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,820
So our next one comes in from Sint says, Hey, guys, about six or seven years ago, I got

662
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,780
intrigued by Dragonfly's Hammer 2 file system.

663
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,040
At the time, it sounded quite advanced.

664
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,520
However, these days there's ButterFS, which I know you guys talk about, but do you have

665
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,040
any experience with good old Hammer 2 or happen to know if there's any serious contenders

666
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,040
in the future?

667
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,800
Yes, it is Hammer time.

668
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,280
Yes, it is.

669
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,160
No, unfortunately, I mean, I've I've mucked about with it a little bit.

670
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,160
I have not tried the the recent Dragonfly release, which sounds like it has some great

671
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,040
performance improvements, at least according to Michael Airball over at Pheronix.

672
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,480
Now I'm not sure we have anything quite as interesting as Hammer.

673
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,840
The file system on Linux I follow and I'm most excited about is BcashFS, which is slowly

674
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
cooking.

675
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,480
We'll get here one of these days.

676
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,640
Yeah, this one's that one's frustrating because it seems like all the major blockers have

677
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,060
been resolved.

678
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,400
But this just not really getting traction and heading towards Linus's tree.

679
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,080
There's just a lot happening and it doesn't seem to be on its way to 5.13 either.

680
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,280
But I agree with Wes BcashFS.

681
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:04,780
Bill from North Carolina writes in, hey, guys, why are window managers so effing ugly and

682
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,360
difficult to customize?

683
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,160
He's specifically talking about the tiling variety.

684
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,240
I don't know if I agree that they're ugly.

685
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,880
I mean, if you go over to Unix porn on Reddit, it's like nothing but tiling window managers

686
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,440
that admittedly look pretty good.

687
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,680
But I think Bill does have a point here that some of these more advanced desktops, you

688
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,800
could say they lack from a design focus team member or two.

689
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,800
Yes.

690
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,280
Well, it's multifaceted, though, right?

691
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,260
It's partially that, but I think it's also partially sort of a keep it simple, stupid

692
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:40,760
sort of mentality or a, you know, you are the user, we're empowering you to make these

693
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,520
choices and we're not even going to bother with making a nice default config because

694
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,640
we think you're just going to configure it yourself anyway and figure out what looks

695
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,700
good to you.

696
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,520
And that doesn't really work well for most people.

697
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:56,720
But if you are compiling yourself a tiling window manager, maybe that's what you want.

698
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,860
It's almost like sort of, you know, setting up an Emacs config versus these days they

699
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,520
have some nicer distributions like Space Max or something that's doing that for you and

700
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,920
hiding some of those details.

701
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,840
But that's also maybe why we were so excited about some of the work that Pop was doing

702
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,360
on their tiling extension, because it was kind of marrying those two worlds of like,

703
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,920
we get some of the features without all the work.

704
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Yep, absolutely.

705
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:20,520
And I think it does come down to maybe finding the right distro that stages the desktop environment

706
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,640
the way you like.

707
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,640
And there's a lot of choice out there.

708
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,760
Hey, just a quick real time update from Sami Ken in the chat room regarding the Bluetooth

709
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,800
headset issue.

710
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,680
That's that profile step down thing, that lower audio quality codec that it does.

711
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,400
I haven't tried this, but Ken says that if you disable the headset microphone in your

712
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,960
OS and use an external one, it will sound a lot better.

713
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,120
So you have to disable any other microphones.

714
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,460
I don't I think what you have there is just pulse audio.

715
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,960
That version of pulse audio steps down to a lower 80 Bluetooth audio quality.

716
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,520
I think it's just a thing.

717
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,880
It's been a thing for a little bit.

718
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,240
NorCal Geek Dad writes in from Northern California.

719
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,600
He says, I've got kids and I've got a gaming related question.

720
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,280
My kids, my nine year old son in particular, have discovered Steam.

721
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,600
Nice, nice man.

722
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
That's great.

723
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:09,200
He says, so far I've been able to keep them happy with my ThinkPad T430 running Steam

724
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,120
on OpenSUSE.

725
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,680
He goes on to say they play Portal and other games that are just totally fine on the integrated

726
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,680
graphics.

727
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:25,120
However, some of the games my son wants to play are only available on Windows.

728
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,200
I have a dual Xeon server.

729
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,960
I could put some more RAM in and then maybe pop in a decent video card and install Windows

730
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,560
and do the Steam link thing.

731
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,300
The containers it's running now could easily be put on a VPS so that really wouldn't be

732
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,880
a big loss.

733
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:44,120
Or I suppose I could option two, format the T430, install Windows and then let them use

734
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,120
that.

735
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,320
Get myself a newer or older ThinkPad for a daily driver.

736
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,560
Or maybe even go the VM with PCIe pass-through route.

737
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,360
What do you guys think would be the easiest, the cheapest or the best?

738
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,120
Thanks, Matt from Northern California.

739
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,880
The easiest is going to just be putting Windows on there.

740
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,080
If you don't have time and you don't want to mess around with dealing with, I don't

741
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,800
know, networked Windows installs or complicated pass-through, that's the simplest.

742
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,960
Is it the most fun or most satisfying?

743
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,960
No.

744
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,040
I don't even know if it truly is the most simplest long-term because my big fear has

745
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,160
been if my kids ever ended up on Windows, they would download like some Minecraft mod

746
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,200
that was totally malware and mess up their Windows box and then I'd be right back in

747
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,680
the bad old days of IT support cleaning up my kids' computers with malware and I was

748
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:37,600
thinking maybe that wasn't such a big deal until my cousin's daughter downloaded what

749
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,760
she thought was a newer version of like Fortnite or something like that, like an update, and

750
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,960
totally trashed her Windows box.

751
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,080
I guess you have a good point here, which is you're the family admin anyway, so minimize

752
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,280
your own pain.

753
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,160
I know what route I have been considering going, Matt, and that is just building my

754
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,880
own Steam streaming setup in my land with the Steam link, and then the nice thing about

755
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,560
that is there's a bunch of other ways you can get that Steam streaming with either the

756
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,560
Steam client itself or Moonlight.

757
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,420
On a Raspberry Pi, you could make it a Steam link, essentially, or if you have the physical

758
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,680
Steam link controller, like it sounds like you do, you could do it that way, and it just

759
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,560
means that you're done with the upgrade game.

760
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,120
You upgrade one machine from that point on, and then you stream those Windows games to

761
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,160
all of the other computers or even TVs, and you don't ever really have to worry about

762
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,120
it, because it'll be an ongoing maintenance issue any other way as far as I see it, because

763
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,880
a VM with PCI passthrough works until you do a distro upgrade or something, and then

764
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,880
it's going to break, and there is nothing more fricking frustrating than when you finally

765
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,400
get a moment to sit down and play a game with the kids, and you have to play tech support

766
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,400
instead.

767
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,680
The other option you could go, it would be even easier, would be something like Nvidia

768
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,120
GeForce Now streaming, which streams Windows Steam games to Linux using Chrome.

769
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,320
That would be an option, but I think you'd be a lot happier with just Steam link over

770
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,320
the LAN.

771
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,240
That'd be the way I'd go about it.

772
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:09,520
Plasma Man from Iowa writes in, I've heard a lot of great career advice on this show,

773
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,800
and I've got a sensitive question.

774
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,440
If a person has average intelligence, drive to learn a new career path, and five plus

775
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,860
years of general IT experience, but it's non-Linux, where do they stand to be up to

776
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,960
speed as a Linux server administrator?

777
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,960
A working adult, say, willing to put in one to two hours a night into learning Linux from

778
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,200
online courses or similar.

779
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:37,080
And this is where Plasma Man has a lot of humility, and I think that goes a long way,

780
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:41,860
and we'll get into that, but I would not want to apply out and struggle not knowing enough,

781
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,600
or worse, be dismissed because I thought I knew enough.

782
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:50,000
How do you gauge if you're ready to present yourself as a person that can hit the ground

783
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,800
running, administrating Linux systems?

784
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,760
Well, Plasma Man, I can tell you that if I were interviewing you and we had had a conversation

785
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,360
of the similar nature, what I would have gotten from you is that, like Wes said, you have

786
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,720
a little humility towards this, and you also have a willing to learn and research attitude,

787
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,160
which would be probably the number one thing that I'd be taking from the interview, and

788
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
I think that's a positive.

789
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
Yeah.

790
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,280
And other than that, you mentioned online courses, but just playing around.

791
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,080
Don't pretend to have done things that you haven't, but be honest about the experiences

792
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,760
you have because there's a lot that's going to be portable, right?

793
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,980
A huge percentage of IT stuff is just troubleshooting, and troubleshooting is troubleshooting.

794
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:29,960
If you've got a good scientific approach, you know how to debug things and figure out

795
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,220
where in the system stuff is breaking or you need to make a change, that is hugely valuable,

796
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:39,440
and you can learn the details of how to look up stuff in a man page or what the flags are.

797
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
Yep.

798
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:44,520
I didn't say it during the Linode read, but it is true.

799
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:49,280
You really could take that $100 credit the show has and use it to build something and

800
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
learn something.

801
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,120
It really is the best way to learn something like that is by doing.

802
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,520
And so we have, you know, that's why Cloud Guru is also a sponsor, and they have a bunch

803
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,320
of labs that can teach you there, and I think combining those two things could be really

804
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,440
useful too, and it's not an accident that there's sponsors on this show.

805
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,440
It's pretty much wise because people like you are looking to get into the field.

806
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,480
Casey, in the IRC, it makes a really good point that, you know, part of this is you

807
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,720
got to be able to sell what you're doing and talk about things, and a good way to practice

808
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,680
that is sharing what you're doing, whether maybe that's on a blog or on your GitHub page

809
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,280
or maybe you join some local Linux users groups or some online groups and, you know, be excited

810
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,280
about this stuff.

811
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,400
If you are, like, that's valuable too, just being able to share that, share some projects

812
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,000
that you've done, contribute to open source with some documentation maybe, or just share

813
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
your neat homelabs.

814
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
How about this?

815
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,680
Get a blog, get a web server up and going, get a blog software package on there, and

816
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,400
then start writing about what you're doing, and then include that in your resume.

817
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,160
That's real experience, and I think if you have a few years, he says he has five plus

818
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:55,200
years of IT experience, that is, a lot of that is a way of thinking, a way of communicating

819
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:01,560
with end users, a way of researching and learning, a lot of that stuff is universal, man, and

820
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,880
it's going to work regardless of the OS, and when you get on the other end of it, you'll

821
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,920
realize how true that is, and kind of how trivial the OS actually is in the grand scheme

822
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,080
of things, as long as you have those core skill sets, and then, yeah, it really comes

823
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:18,640
down to how you communicate it, how you sell yourself, and how confident you are, you know,

824
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,600
because that confidence, that confidence does kind of come through during those conversations,

825
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,360
and in there, I'm also going to link in the show notes to a recruiter post.

826
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,600
She wrote this up recently, but she was a recruiter for like nine years, and now she

827
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:37,560
works for Microsoft, and it's a decent list of advice, it's like a, it's a top seven kind

828
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,520
of list, but it's like an actually good list, so I'll include that in the show notes, that

829
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,720
might help narrow it down too, but it is a, it's a question we get in all the time to

830
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,920
code a radio as well, people that want to get into the development world, and a lot

831
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,600
of times it's like, well, this is a great chance for free software, like find a project

832
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:02,200
that needs somebody to do a little development for them, find a project, in the case of our

833
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,180
of our writer here, find a project that could use a little infrastructure help.

834
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,760
There's a lot of them, you know, a lot of them are just doing the infrastructure themselves

835
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,300
because there's nobody else out there to do it.

836
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,080
It can be a touchy thing, because you don't want to come across sounding like you're being

837
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,160
judgmental about the state of their infrastructure, you know, you don't want to pop in the IRC

838
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,800
and be like, hey, who's in charge of the server here, because this is set up wrong, when was

839
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,840
the last time you did a release, come on, that will get you nowhere real quick.

840
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:34,760
But if there, if there was, you know, a hypothetical community that maybe you could become a member

841
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:41,700
of and help identify infrastructure that they need, web presence, or maintaining a back

842
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,720
end repository or a mirror or something like that, that you could provide, that gives you

843
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,440
an opportunity to, it's, it's, it's not no stakes, but it's not extremely high stakes.

844
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,040
But it's enough that you're going to take it seriously, and you're going to learn and

845
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,360
you're going to be put in positions where you have to adapt.

846
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,200
And I mean, yeah, you got to do it for free.

847
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,640
But man, think about that in the cost and value of training.

848
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,480
It's really kind of invaluable.

849
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,240
And in the modern day, we don't have a lot of apprenticeships and things like that.

850
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,940
It's, but that is a, you can think of it in sort of similar terms.

851
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,480
In a way, it's an apprenticeship for you to learn how to manage an infrastructure for

852
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:25,640
something that's getting public use, and has some requirements around its availability,

853
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,080
which is going to force you to learn and adapt.

854
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:32,640
And the project also benefits from having somebody who's dedicated to helping them out

855
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,640
a little bit.

856
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,000
And so it's a win for the project.

857
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And it's a win for you.

858
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,600
And even though you're not going to walk away a millionaire from doing it, you're going

859
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,080
to walk away more confident, and you're going to be able to speak more clearly.

860
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,260
And you're gonna be able to speak about these things in simple terms that demonstrate you

861
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,260
understand them.

862
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,260
Right.

863
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,440
And just having been through some of those fires, right, having to figure out like, well,

864
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,520
this wasn't ideal, and it kind of sucked.

865
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,520
But we got through it.

866
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,680
And here's how we dealt with it and made compromises because I mean, that's all that goes on in

867
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,680
a business anyway.

868
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,680
Right?

869
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,680
Like, you got to make it work.

870
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,680
It's never perfect.

871
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,680
But if you get through it, that's valuable.

872
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:03,720
Neil, do you have anything to add to what Wes and I have listed off?

873
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,440
Yeah, actually, like one of the ways that I kind of got started doing all the, you know,

874
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:13,400
infrared type stuff, like, you know, my I'm professionally a senior DevOps engineer, and

875
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,800
I work on, you know, maintaining infrastructure for software delivery pipelines and stuff

876
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,920
that my employer Datto and kind of the way I got started doing all this stuff was actually

877
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,320
working in open source projects doing this kind of infrastructure work.

878
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:33,720
So you know, and I can say that today, like the Fedora infrastructure team in the Fedora

879
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:39,040
project actually has an awesome apprenticeship program for being able to get started with

880
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,560
learning these kinds of things, working with things like OpenShift, Ansible, you know,

881
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:49,480
all the all the modern technology that you tend to see in a in a real business environment.

882
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,180
And same goes on the openSUSE side, they've got the openSUSE heroes team, which works

883
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:58,720
with virtual machines uses salt, and works with a wide variety of different technologies

884
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,140
and different stacks to be like, it's a very common thing.

885
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:07,040
And like, as a real systems administrator, you wind up working with a lot of crazy things

886
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,180
and having to work a lot of different technologies.

887
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:14,440
And in in large open source Linux distribution projects, you wind up in the same boat.

888
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,980
And they're great ways to like, get some hands on, get some experience, work with people

889
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:24,900
who kind of know this stuff, and like build that intuition up that helps you be successful

890
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,180
doing it professionally.

891
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:31,100
So I absolutely would recommend, you know, if you want to get started with this, if you're

892
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:36,740
a Fedora user, all the better, like check out Fedora's infrastructure team, and hang

893
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,380
out with them and see, you know, how you can get started there.

894
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:42,380
Or if you're an openSUSE user, do the same with the openSUSE heroes.

895
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,940
Yeah, there's probably if you think about the projects and software you use, there's

896
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,380
probably something out there that speaks to you.

897
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:52,140
Casey, I know this kind of touches on an experience that you've had.

898
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:58,100
Yeah, I got my dream job just, you know, being out there in a community I was I was commenting

899
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:02,180
in a blog post for a software engineering group.

900
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:07,420
And just like professionals consume the same things that you're excited to, and participating

901
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:14,340
in it is a huge way to be able to point to on your resume, hey, you know, I'm already

902
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,500
thinking about this stuff a lot, I'll be thinking about it just as much when I'm working for

903
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,500
you.

904
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,420
It'll also help teach you some of the jargon I expect, you know, like learn how do the

905
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,100
people in the industry refer to these things, and you'll kind of learn some of the things

906
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,420
of like, what do they expect on the job?

907
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,580
And what can I go learn ahead of time to make sure that I at least have a little of the

908
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:39,420
context mail route.net slash Linux try out mail route today and get 10% off the lifetime

909
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,580
of your account and start with a 30 day free trial, no credit card required to see it really

910
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,860
works great.

911
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:48,580
And part of the reason, maybe not just part, but a big part of the reason is they've been

912
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:52,580
around for 24 years, and they have focused on their core competency.

913
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:57,440
And I think you guys know something about me, there's a theme, I like independent companies

914
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,360
that focus on something for a long time and try to make it real good.

915
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,960
That's definitely mail route.

916
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,840
And you can get started at mail route.net slash Linux, you know, really, the core value

917
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,100
of mail route goes beyond just removing spam and viruses.

918
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,860
But really, it helps you prevent downtime.

919
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:20,340
And it helps with compliance to the downtime part is essential.

920
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,380
We knew we wanted to use that for our mail server, we wanted something where if we want

921
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,600
to take it down and upgrade it, we don't lose out on email.

922
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,860
mail route will automatically queue it up for us and we can go in and we can have it

923
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,960
keep it up to 15 days or whatever you tell but like by default, it's gonna keep it up

924
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,180
to 15 days.

925
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,940
And then when your mail server comes online, it just just forwards it right along like

926
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:39,440
it was like it was never gone.

927
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,260
Just Oh, mail starts coming in your inbox like you were never offline.

928
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,940
It's brilliant.

929
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,460
I love that about it.

930
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:51,460
And if you want to host somewhere where maybe you have an issue with the IP, or you have

931
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,340
to work with a different port, mail route is flexible there as well.

932
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,700
And getting set up is so simple.

933
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:02,300
If you're on Office 365, if you're on Google Apps, it's all one click, which seems like

934
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,260
some kind of magic.

935
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,260
But it works.

936
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,840
And it works really well.

937
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,260
You get security, you get speed, you get uptime, and you get a streamlined workflow along with

938
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,880
real time logs.

939
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,620
mail route is email magic.

940
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:20,100
They are one of the first to really build in this kind of email filtering service back

941
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:25,940
in 1997. that's so awesome.

942
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,480
That's basically as long as I've been using Linux mail route has been around.

943
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,480
That's amazing.

944
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,480
Wow.

945
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,960
They have an API that you can integrate with as well.

946
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:38,340
If you like to do some automated tasks and build up your infrastructure through code,

947
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,180
somebody tells me that's a great idea.

948
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,700
And of course, I love the real time log searching when we were setting up our email server.

949
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,900
And the fact that that downtime prevention is there is just really nice.

950
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,780
It gives me the confidence to put this thing into production.

951
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,940
So go try it out.

954
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:09,860
Now we have our last batch of questions we're going to get to this episode we have more

955
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,780
we'll try to do in the future, but we just have this last batch.

956
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,260
Oh, here's a good one.

957
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:20,180
Bill from somewhere on the eastern seaboard writes, I would love to hear the story behind

958
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:24,380
the intro music of the various current JB podcasts.

959
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,820
Oh, yeah.

960
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:26,820
Okay.

961
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:28,520
The story of the song.

962
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,980
If Chris can remember, yeah, it has been a long time.

963
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:37,100
So the thing that always felt off about a lot of podcasts was the music like the music

964
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:40,060
was never great because of all the licensing issues, right?

965
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,680
You can't use the music you want because you can't afford it right unless you want to be

966
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,140
dedicated only on Spotify.

967
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:48,380
Now, if you do that, they'll let you play any music you want, but I don't think that's

968
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,180
going to happen.

969
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:55,800
So you know, I wanted something in the thing to guys you gotta you gotta know is you gotta

970
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,660
appreciate the fact that a long time ago, podcasts have like long intros when the show

971
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,380
first started, like we had a really long intro and that was normal.

972
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,420
And then we realized, hey, dummy, somebody's gonna listen to 100 of these, they're gonna

973
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:13,660
get a little sick of waiting a minute for the show to start the same music every time.

974
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:19,660
So we shorten it and shorten it and the music is less less in the show now, but it used

975
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:20,980
to be in there for a much longer.

976
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,940
So I wanted it to sound damn good.

977
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:27,760
And I just knew I was going to need something that was better than the rest.

978
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:36,580
And so I came across Ronald Jenkes and he had this song that helped my son fall asleep.

979
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:41,540
He was just a little baby boy and he had an upset tummy most nights and he'd be swaddled

980
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:47,260
while I was editing and I needed music I could play on a loop that he would fall asleep to.

981
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:51,100
But you know, it wasn't it wasn't boring, it just had to be something for he loved it

982
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,300
and he so put it relaxed him.

983
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,740
And it was the it was Ronald Jenkes outer space song, which is great.

984
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,780
And I still love it to this day.

985
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:04,020
And so I contacted Ronald and I said, Hey, man, you know, I just love your music.

986
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,160
I'm doing these podcasts here.

987
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,780
What would you think about me using some of your songs?

988
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,860
And he said, Hey, man, I listened to your shows.

989
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,400
I love your shows.

990
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,620
How about I license my music to you?

991
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,340
And I'm like, that would be great.

992
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:20,860
And so we've had access.

993
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:26,920
And I really, I really just so grateful we have that we have that access licensed access

994
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,180
to Ronald Jenkes music for years.

995
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,980
And all of the songs all of our shows are just standard tracks of his on his albums

996
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:35,140
that you can go buy and download and listen.

997
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,980
And you can search for him on your streaming service of choice as well.

998
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:43,180
And so we picked different parts of the songs that we think make great intros and outros.

999
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:45,260
And we have used them across a lot of our shows over the years.

1000
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,180
Yeah, they get like crunched down or remixed.

1001
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:50,700
I mean, Joe did some nice work on the current variant for this show.

1002
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:51,700
Yep, yep.

1003
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,580
We've tweaked it a little bit here and there and made it you know, a little shorter or

1004
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,460
taken out just a part of a song.

1005
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,860
And so what's neat about that is a lot of our shows actually have much longer versions

1006
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:02,860
of the intro.

1007
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:06,380
So if you really were into the song, you can actually go find like a three minute version

1008
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,380
of it.

1009
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,380
And they're amazing.

1010
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:09,940
He's done incredible work.

1011
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:15,040
And you can find some video of his on YouTube and the man it's like watching commander data

1012
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,740
in Star Trek work the L cars interface.

1013
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:22,380
He just Ronald Jenkes just flies across the keyboard like you just wouldn't even so that's

1014
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,500
pretty neat.

1015
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:27,880
And I am forever grateful for him for him letting us use his music.

1016
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,620
Will writes in with a second question over there on the eastern seaboard.

1017
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,500
He says what is your Linux origin story?

1018
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,500
All right.

1019
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,540
Well, I I went online.

1020
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,980
So what's your Linux origin story with

1021
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:38,700
Linux origin story?

1022
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,500
Yeah, when did you start using Linux?

1023
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:42,500
You know, I'm not okay.

1024
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,340
It must have been it was probably about 2005.

1025
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,340
I think.

1026
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,340
All right.

1027
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,340
All right.

1028
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,340
Do you remember what brought you over?

1029
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,660
It was actually that there was Linux at my high school.

1030
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:53,660
Oh, cool.

1031
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:54,660
Yeah.

1032
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,660
This will date me terribly.

1033
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,020
But for some reason they were it was already installed.

1034
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:02,460
It was it was like, can home to I think they were running Debian.

1035
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,460
Yeah.

1036
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,020
That sounds like a typical school setup.

1037
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,020
Yeah.

1038
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,020
It was kind of great.

1039
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,020
None.

1040
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,020
None of the students really paid attention.

1041
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,800
We're all just playing risk online in the library instead of doing any kind of research.

1042
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,500
But they had these like nice computer labs doled out with Linux was I'm sure was much

1043
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:21,380
cheaper for them and actually an active IT staff, which I did not take advantage of.

1044
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:25,100
I didn't really get interested in the computer science until a little bit later.

1045
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:29,040
But I remember having used GCC to compile something but like left it running on the

1046
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,740
network with the network mount.

1047
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,460
And then someone pulling me out of class later being like, hey, what's going on?

1048
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,260
What are you doing here?

1049
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,940
So clearly they had people that cared and, you know, like we're really taking care of

1050
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,780
these systems, which was which was pretty neat.

1051
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:44,400
And so that got me to install some, you know, a version of Debian at home and then later

1052
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,700
Ubuntu and start playing it with it from there.

1053
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:49,580
And I was interested in it really since then.

1054
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,620
And at college, of course, I pretty much just ditched Windows.

1055
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:53,620
That's great.

1056
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:54,620
I love I love that.

1057
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,380
I played a lot of old Quake, like Quake one.

1058
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,380
Yeah.

1059
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,380
Yeah, that was good.

1060
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,260
That was good times.

1061
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:06,580
The stupidest thing I ever did, I can't believe I did it now, but the absolute dumbest thing

1062
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:12,580
I ever did was I hung a modem off of my desk because I was I was the computer kid that

1063
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,460
had his own dedicated computer in the computer lab in the back.

1064
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:20,380
I was that kid because I had kind of put one together based on fixing all the other computers.

1065
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:26,060
And the dumbest thing I did is I hung a modem off there to create my own ISP, which not

1066
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:30,340
only it sucked because because of the way the school's phone system worked, I couldn't

1067
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,860
get a 56K connection.

1068
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,340
So I was I could only get like thirty three six.

1069
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:38,500
So just like thirty three K. But it was my own ISP.

1070
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,500
Right.

1071
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:44,940
But of course, now looking back, I just created a back door because they had a T1, which was

1072
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,160
a big deal back then.

1073
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,560
That's what I wanted access to.

1074
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:50,900
And so I would queue things to download on my computer there and then transfer them over

1075
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,900
my modem.

1076
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:52,900
Brilliant.

1077
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:53,900
Oh, my gosh, Wes.

1078
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:58,400
You know, it's ironic is I'm essentially doing the equivalent today in Lady Dupes over cellular

1079
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,300
connections transferring from the studio.

1080
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:05,620
So there's that my origin story is long and I think I want to do an interview with it

1081
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:12,020
because it involves a leak of a series of Red Hat this from a Microsoft employee.

1082
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,580
Well, sounds like many might have an origin story to take your place.

1083
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,580
All right.

1084
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,580
I love that.

1085
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,580
Minimac, what's your Linux origin story?

1086
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:21,480
I became bored of windows.

1087
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,480
That's it.

1088
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:29,180
And all of a sudden I was in a store and I saw a box with, say, six point one.

1089
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:32,060
Oh, that was like nineteen ninety nine, I think.

1090
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:37,620
I loved those those multifold boxes that had all the discs in the sleeves and artwork inside.

1091
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:38,860
You could expand it out.

1092
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:44,980
You had like seven disc and like a four hundred page booklet with it.

1093
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,280
And then I bought that one.

1094
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,580
So that came with KDE and GNOME one point zero.

1095
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:57,500
And you had that x eighty six config where you had to configure everything from the mouse

1096
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,500
to everything.

1097
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,820
You even had to configure the printer.

1098
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,380
But that was my first experience.

1099
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:07,100
I love that classic version where you have all those discs and you had to swap the disc

1100
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,380
during the installation.

1101
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,460
I still have that one.

1102
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,460
It's lying.

1103
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,900
Yeah, it's lying around here.

1104
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:17,340
And then I used it like I had like some kind of server where I started playing around with

1105
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:22,060
it and then like two or three years later, I switched completely to Linux.

1106
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,540
That was like two thousand and one, two thousand and two.

1107
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:29,220
I'll tell you this, my like core origin story with Linux, because it is quite the interesting

1108
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,660
story, I didn't even really appreciate it until I was reminded of it a little while

1109
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,660
ago.

1110
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,660
I thought, you know, we should tell it sometime.

1111
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:39,220
But the thing that the thing that I the moment I remember, I remember the moment I fell in

1112
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,820
love, the moment I fell in love with Linux.

1113
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:45,580
I could really tell it was different and I could really tell it was more powerful when

1114
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,120
I deleted my own file system.

1115
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,380
And I mentioned this on the show before.

1116
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:54,700
It's the moment the moment I did a classic rookie mistake way back in the day of deleting

1117
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:58,740
my root file system with RM, which was easier back then.

1118
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:03,580
And then that I didn't realize it had happened for about 40 seconds.

1119
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,940
So I deleted my file system.

1120
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:09,580
And then the thing that made me really, truly, truly fall in love is that not only could

1121
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:14,200
I delete my file system, but I kept using my active applications for like almost a minute

1122
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,580
before I ran into a problem.

1123
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,580
It's fine.

1124
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:17,580
It's all in memory.

1125
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:23,060
And I sat there and went, wow, this son of a bitch just let me delete myself and it didn't

1126
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,580
even stop me.

1127
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,780
Windows would never do that.

1128
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,780
This is amazing.

1129
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,780
All right.

1130
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,180
So there we went on way too long.

1131
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,740
What's our what's our next email, Mr. Payne?

1132
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,580
Yeah, that was a little bit too much fun.

1133
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:37,660
Let's take things a bit more serious.

1134
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:42,860
Daniel from Ohio writes in, how's your health going, Chris?

1135
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:47,220
I know you've complained about RSI in the past and mentioned it on the show.

1136
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:50,220
And of course, there was that time that you had to go to the hospital.

1137
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:53,860
I just wish the best for you, the team and your family.

1138
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:54,860
Oh, thank you.

1139
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:58,020
Yeah, that trip to the hospital, that was crazy.

1140
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:02,620
That was really wild that I still have a big old scar from that.

1141
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:05,380
My appendix, it ruptured.

1142
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:14,540
And the thing about that is I have a hard time taking time off because it's really hard

1143
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:17,500
from a lot of reasons when you run a small business to take time off.

1144
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:22,580
And so I was I was right in the middle of preparing the public announcement that Linux

1145
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:25,720
Academy acquired Jupiter Broadcasting, just a little busy.

1146
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,060
We had a live stream with a public date.

1147
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,520
Everything was locked in and set.

1148
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,740
People were flying into Texas for the announcement.

1149
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:37,320
I just not proceeding was literally not an option.

1150
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,660
And you can imagine this was something that was multiple months in the works.

1151
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:46,500
And so I attended a fair and I ate a hot dog and I thought, oh, I got food poisoning is

1152
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,500
what I thought.

1153
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,940
I kept rationalizing that I had food poisoning.

1154
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,800
And so as I got progressively sicker to the point where I couldn't keep any food down

1155
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:59,420
for about three weeks, I figured, well, it's probably time to go in and see a doctor.

1156
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:03,020
It was probably about two weeks past time to go see a doctor in retrospect.

1157
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:06,900
But then that's that's the point is I thought I just had food poisoning and it happened

1158
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,300
before I had rough food poisoning before.

1159
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:12,680
So I go in, the doctor says, no, you definitely had an infection.

1160
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,220
But good news is it looks like things are on the mend.

1161
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,740
You're good to go for travel to Texas.

1162
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:19,980
I say, thanks, doctor.

1163
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:20,980
I've never met before.

1164
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:23,640
I'm going to go to Texas.

1165
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:28,700
So I fly down for the announcement and I fly down the Thursday before the Tuesday we were

1166
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:30,460
going to make the announcement.

1167
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,660
And I'm not doing real well.

1168
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:35,260
I'm not feeling so I go into Linux Academy's office for like a few hours and then I figured

1169
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,200
maybe I should go home and sleep it off.

1170
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:42,260
So I go back and I grab myself a beer and I drink a beer and I chat.

1171
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:45,380
I make nice with the with the bartender for about a half hour.

1172
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:50,940
And then I go up to my office, I go up to my room and I just crash and wake up the next

1173
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:52,480
day and I feel real bad.

1174
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,700
And I think, oh, man, that beer really screwed me up.

1175
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:57,100
I shouldn't have had that beer.

1176
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:03,360
Well, it turns out I was not able to make it out of my bed that day because my appendix

1177
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:07,700
had ruptured and then all of the crap in there had eaten away over the about a three week

1178
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:12,800
period at the muscles that connected my my like hip muscles to like my bones.

1179
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:18,540
And so I had lost functionality of my leg and couldn't get out of bed and thought maybe

1180
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:22,740
what I should do to kind of fix this is maybe I should just sleep a little bit.

1181
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:26,460
So I thought, I'll just sleep it off and then I'll wake up on Monday and I'll be good to

1182
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:27,460
go.

1183
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,460
And then Tuesday we'll make the announcement.

1184
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:29,460
Everything's going to be fine.

1185
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,180
I just need a little more sleep.

1186
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:34,900
And my wife thought, well, I'll fly down and surprise him with a nice romantic weekend

1187
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:36,940
because, you know, we're about to make this big public announcement.

1188
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:39,140
I'll take him out because he's just been down there working.

1189
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:41,060
He's got no nothing to do.

1190
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:45,820
She flies down and finds me in this totally incapacitated state and is like, are you kidding

1191
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:46,820
me?

1192
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:47,820
We're taking you to the hospital right now.

1193
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,100
I'm like, poor idea.

1194
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:52,420
I get into the hospital and of course they won't let me leave because they've taken me

1195
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,760
into emergency surgery.

1196
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,660
They tell me it's going to be two little incisions.

1197
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:56,940
We're going to get that appendix out of there.

1198
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:58,740
You're going to be fine, Mr. Fisher.

1199
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:04,300
I wake up and I have an incision from my crotch to my chest that they had to cut me open and

1200
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,740
splay me way open and go in there and clean everything out, carve out a bunch of stuff.

1201
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:16,620
And I have this ginormous incision that took five to six months to heal with daily care

1202
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:17,620
and maintenance.

1203
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:19,460
It was awful.

1204
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:22,900
And thankfully during all of that I had health coverage because, you know, I was part of

1205
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:25,340
Linux Academy and they had a really good health plan.

1206
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:31,180
And so they covered the $200,000 bill that was to have all that happen.

1207
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:36,820
I think I ended up paying maybe seven grand total out of pocket.

1208
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:37,820
Wow.

1209
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,820
Yeah.

1210
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,180
And that was thankfully just because some of the stuff that, you know, I just had a

1211
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:44,500
few things that are out of network and stuff that I had to cover.

1212
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,340
So you know, other, so from there my health has gotten much better.

1213
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,740
It's gotten much better.

1214
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:55,260
I I've gained more weight over the COVID lockdown than I'd like, except for one.

1215
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,260
Yeah.

1216
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:59,560
But I'm working on that and we're about to take a little time, you know, to go penguin

1217
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:00,560
hunt.

1218
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:01,900
I mean take pictures of penguins.

1219
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,940
So we're getting out there, going to get some air.

1220
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:04,940
Yeah.

1221
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:05,940
You know, just a high fat diet.

1222
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:06,940
It's going to be great.

1223
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:07,940
All right.

1224
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:10,660
Well, let's, let's take things lighter again.

1225
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,700
What's the deal with so many new domains for everything?

1226
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:14,700
Yeah.

1227
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:15,700
Yeah.

1228
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:16,900
It's jupytergarage.com.

1229
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,780
We've got asklup.com.

1230
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,660
This anonymous writer?

1231
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:21,660
Yeah.

1232
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:22,660
Anonymous wrote in, I guess.

1233
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:23,660
Yeah.

1234
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:28,180
I have only a few domains and it feels like that's too many to juggle.

1235
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,180
I mean, yeah.

1236
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,180
I feel you there Anon.

1237
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:33,500
I mean, how many name chibi reminder emails do I need?

1238
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,500
Boy, yeah.

1239
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,020
Thankfully that kind of stuff is a business expense.

1240
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,280
It's a legitimate expense for the business.

1241
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,420
So why so many domains?

1242
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,800
Sometimes I get a domain just because it's like, it feels like getting a little piece

1243
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:48,020
of real estate, but honestly it's so that way it's easy to communicate with you guys

1244
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:50,500
and it's easy to remember.

1245
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,340
It's just simpler if I say asklup.com, right?

1246
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:58,260
It's just easier to communicate and you're listening and I need to say something that

1247
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:00,580
you'll remember when you get back to your desk or whatever.

1248
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:03,020
So a domain is often the way to do that.

1249
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:07,940
I just saw an email come in reminding me of a prank domain that I have.

1250
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:08,940
What was it?

1251
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:09,940
What was it?

1252
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:10,940
You don't want to say?

1253
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:13,060
No, I'm not going to say because it's not relevant to the show.

1254
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:17,940
It's just an amusing thing between friends, but I have several of those.

1255
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:20,340
It must be really good if you don't want to say it on air.

1256
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:23,780
I have an embarrassing one, but you might know what it is, but I have an embarrassing

1257
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:24,780
one I'll admit to.

1258
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:25,780
Oh yeah?

1259
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:27,780
But you got to admit to yours.

1260
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:28,780
Is it active?

1261
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:29,780
Will it lead people somewhere?

1262
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:30,780
Is that why you don't want to say it?

1263
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:31,780
Yeah, I know.

1264
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:32,780
Okay.

1265
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:33,780
All right.

1266
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,780
Okay.

1267
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:35,780
I have a second one.

1268
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:36,780
Okay.

1269
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,780
Yeah.

1270
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:38,780
What is it?

1271
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:39,780
Turdkey.com.

1272
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:40,780
That's good.

1273
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:41,780
Here's the idea, right?

1274
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:47,700
It's a lot of, you go to Airbnb's or similar setups, you've rented some place and it's

1275
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:52,100
not great, but you don't want to ruin your account over there by leaving a bunch of negative

1276
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,460
comments and getting negative comments back.

1277
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:58,780
Head on over to turdkey.com, leave your stinker right there.

1278
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:00,260
That's great.

1279
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:01,260
That's great.

1280
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,260
Mine is not nearly as funny.

1281
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:06,780
I mean, I do have some really crazy ones because I actually think the crazier ones are easy

1282
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:07,780
to remember.

1283
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:08,780
Yeah, that's fair.

1284
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:11,940
So if I can drop a.ninja or something in there, I'm doing it.

1285
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:12,940
The pizza.

1286
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:13,940
Yeah.

1287
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:18,740
I'm fond of star trek.sexy because I always thought it would be like a great domain to

1288
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:22,700
take advantage of is something about star trek.sexy and I feel like it's going to be

1289
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,320
more valuable as time goes on.

1290
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,500
So that's mine.

1291
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,500
Yeah.

1292
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,500
It is too many domains.

1293
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,340
You are absolutely right about that.

1294
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:34,260
Jared from Memphis writes in, love you guys, but I have no sense of your tastes outside

1295
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:36,580
of this wonderful free software world.

1296
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:38,860
Would you name a favorite film, movie or book?

1297
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:42,300
Well, I think we just got insight into you, Wes.

1298
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,300
Sure did.

1299
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,300
Hmm.

1300
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:47,420
I mean, I talk about Star Trek all the time.

1301
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:48,420
We both do.

1302
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:52,740
I just got done watching The Expanse.

1303
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:56,060
That is such a great world builder sci-fi series.

1304
01:04:56,060 --> 01:05:00,740
And then when you get hooked and you want more, they have books that give you an even

1305
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:04,860
expanded version of the universe, which I think is very complimentary to actually watch

1306
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:06,700
the TV show first and then listen to the books.

1307
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,580
I'm onto the second book now.

1308
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:10,380
I've really been enjoying The Expanse.

1309
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:15,100
It's complex, detailed, well thought out sci-fi.

1310
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:21,980
And just recently there is like an astronomer or a physics expert that watches and reacts

1311
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:26,600
to The Expanse and she was very impressed by the way they handle low gravity situations

1312
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,600
and whatnot.

1313
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,600
What about you?

1314
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:29,600
Got anything?

1315
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:30,600
Yeah.

1316
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,700
I mean, there's like probably too many things.

1317
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:37,200
I do think The Expanse is just fascinating from a sci-fi enjoyment perspective.

1318
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:42,060
Another sci-fi I've liked lately has been the Culture series by Ian Banks, which I just

1319
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:46,340
find fascinating and a lot of fun to read and is really sad that he's passed because

1320
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,500
I would love more of those books.

1321
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:54,580
I also just like totally unrelated to anything here, I really enjoy jazz.

1322
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:58,180
That's one thing, jazz, classical music, and really all music on the side.

1323
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:03,220
I don't know if I have a favorite, but there is a particular jazz station here in the Pacific

1324
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:07,020
Northwest KNKX that I listen to and they just really crush it.

1325
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:09,340
Yeah, they are pros.

1326
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,940
I think also you guys know me for loving the road trips.

1327
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:16,300
I've got three kids and so we love going on little trips and doing stuff like that.

1328
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:20,420
So there's those elements of life.

1329
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:24,060
I spent a little bit of time and I've just recently picked back up getting into drone

1330
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,060
videography, which I really liked.

1331
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:27,060
Oh, great.

1332
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,060
Yeah, it's so fun.

1333
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:31,060
It's so nice to get up there and get those high perspective views and really get a sense

1334
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:32,660
of where you're at when you're traveling.

1335
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:35,820
So thanks for asking, Jared, we appreciate it.

1336
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:38,220
And the last one comes in from PyCrash.

1337
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:39,220
That's right.

1338
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:44,060
What do you like most about being an independent network?

1339
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:45,600
Well that worked out really well.

1340
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:49,380
So we got a bunch of emails in and we got to this is essentially the halfway mark right

1341
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,380
here.

1342
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,380
And so that's a great one to end on.

1343
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:54,540
So PyCrash asked what we like most, huh?

1344
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:55,780
You have an answer?

1345
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:56,780
Before I get into it?

1346
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:57,780
Because I know I have one.

1347
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:01,740
But I'm curious from your perspective, what's the best thing now about JB being independent?

1348
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:04,380
Oh boy, that's a good question.

1349
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:07,060
Because in some ways it's been a lot more work.

1350
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:09,660
So from a work standpoint, it's kind of been harder.

1351
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:10,660
Right.

1352
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,420
And there's more constraints in different ways.

1353
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:14,420
Yeah.

1354
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:16,900
There's different concepts and constraints for sure.

1355
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:17,900
But in other ways.

1356
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:18,900
Oh yeah.

1357
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:19,900
No, in other ways it's great.

1358
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:23,100
I mean, I think it's just the focus is nice.

1359
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:27,700
It's JB can just be about the show content.

1360
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:32,580
Like when you're part of a company, and this is true for my day job, there's just a lot

1361
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:39,820
of compromises and other things, housekeeping, if you will, that you have to deal with.

1362
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:45,500
And that was certainly true in the previous JB era, for better or worse, at different

1363
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:46,500
times.

1364
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:47,500
Right.

1365
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,500
Like that just changed with how the organization was.

1366
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,060
It's a whole team that you have to update.

1367
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:51,060
Yeah.

1368
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:52,060
I think about LAN.

1369
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:55,860
In the small tweaks we've been making since you joined me on LAN, kind of like little

1370
01:07:55,860 --> 01:08:00,000
tiny of adjustments here and there, or we try, like right now we're kind of experimenting

1371
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,820
with kind of quickly going through some stories that you should know about, but don't require

1372
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:08,220
a lot of discussion and then leaving time at the end of the episode to really kind of

1373
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:10,260
just go deep into something.

1374
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:15,140
That's a change you and I just made in the last few weeks, just on our own, didn't really

1375
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:19,180
like talk about it first, like in a team meeting and then kind of, you know, give an outline

1376
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,420
of how it would work and like we just did it.

1377
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:22,420
Yeah.

1378
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:24,820
Before there was a lot of process, which was often very supportive.

1379
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:25,820
Yeah.

1380
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:26,820
It was good and bad.

1381
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:31,420
But now there's a lot of freedom to just sort of tweak it as needs right in the moment.

1382
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:32,420
Yeah.

1383
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:40,180
I think it's like, and sometimes with some types of media that's good and bad, like with

1384
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:46,420
LAN, Linux action news, it's good because you kind of, you need to every now and then

1385
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:51,500
be willing to reformulate when the news presents a curve ball that week.

1386
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:57,260
Sometimes there's just a mix of stories where a standard approach doesn't work and you got

1387
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:58,620
to go, how can we adapt?

1388
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:02,020
And having the ability to say, as we're both sitting right there at the mic, how do we

1389
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:04,180
adapt to this right then and there?

1390
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:05,180
That's really nice.

1391
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:08,260
And so it means that we don't have quite the support.

1392
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:12,660
It means that Wes and I are spending more time on a Sunday making that happen instead

1393
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:16,980
of just hitting record, doing our bit and then walking away.

1394
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:24,780
But independent means really for me that content is our core product.

1395
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:28,860
So when you're part of a larger organization, you have more money, you have more support,

1396
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:33,920
you have access to more resources and you have access to people who have maybe managed

1397
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:37,860
other projects and can give you guidance to manage a project that you want to do right

1398
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:39,460
now.

1399
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:45,420
But there is one sort of truth that is unavoidable.

1400
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:51,820
And that is the job of making content for a large organization is almost never the core

1401
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,740
focus of the organization.

1402
01:09:54,740 --> 01:10:00,060
The organization makes its money selling a widget or a service and the content maybe

1403
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:04,760
is part of the sales funnel to drive people to the service or the widget.

1404
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:09,820
But the business does not breathe, live, eat and die on the content alone.

1405
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:16,680
And unless the business is wholly dependent, its success is absolutely dependent on the

1406
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,820
quality of its content.

1407
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:24,180
Unless the business must survive by its content, the content will always suffer because it

1408
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:26,260
is not the top priority.

1409
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,120
It's just human nature.

1410
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:29,540
It's just how you organize things.

1411
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:32,140
It's not, it's not malicious.

1412
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:33,140
It's just what it is.

1413
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:40,980
And content has to be the main focus of everyone's efforts if the content is going to be competitive

1414
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:41,980
and high quality.

1415
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:42,980
Yeah.

1416
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:45,460
But what about quarterly returns and those OKRs you were working on?

1417
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:46,460
Right.

1418
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:50,100
And there are places for that, especially when you're trying to build other kinds of

1419
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:51,620
products.

1420
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:57,860
But when the product you're trying to build is media and content, it needs to be the,

1421
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:02,220
it needs to be the thing that determines if the business is successful or not.

1422
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:06,300
Otherwise the content will never be as good as it has to be.

1423
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:10,200
And it requires just absolute focus like that.

1424
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:16,740
That means so for now that we're independent, there is only one job, really, and it's make

1425
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,080
good shows.

1426
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:23,200
There is a ton of stuff that you guys would never even believe we'd have to do and spend

1427
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:26,620
time managing in service of that goal.

1428
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:32,060
But the company, the business has a singular goal and its content.

1429
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:37,220
And the reason why I emphasize that is because, well, how many businesses can you name that

1430
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:40,900
have a singular focus, a singular goal?

1431
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:42,900
Some but they're probably smaller ones, right?

1432
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,100
When you start thinking about bigger companies, all of a sudden they only got like maybe three

1433
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:48,400
goals or they got like a dozen goals, right?

1434
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:53,100
You need one goal when you're making content and that needs to be good content.

1435
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:59,100
You need to have laser focus and I think the only way to do that is to be independent right

1436
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:00,100
now.

1437
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:02,300
I don't know if it's always, I think it's probably the only way to ever do it, but maybe

1438
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,300
I'm wrong.

1439
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:07,740
But right now it seems the only way to accomplish that is to live and die on the content.

1440
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:12,940
So the business has to be at a scale where that's conceivable and that means being independent.

1441
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:14,940
Then that's just the realities of the business.

1442
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:18,980
I think there's also an element that you just like being your own boss.

1443
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:23,460
All right, I got a pick just for you, Wes.

1444
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,460
What for me?

1445
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:27,420
It's a little behind the scenes explainer here.

1446
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:30,540
I should have, I should have got the rap option.

1447
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:35,860
Whenever Wes and I need to transfer a file across the land, Wes just wants to use Netcat.

1448
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:36,860
That's all that's wants to you.

1449
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:40,060
I was going to say sorry, but I'm not sorry.

1450
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:43,740
So check out termbin.com.

1451
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:50,260
It is a terminal pastebin and this is a great way because you can actually get information

1452
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:53,380
in and out of this using Netcat.

1453
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:56,980
There's a couple of different ways you can use Netcat to actually get stuff up here.

1454
01:12:56,980 --> 01:13:00,100
And I just thought this was perfect for you because it's one more way to take advantage

1455
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:02,780
of software you already have installed on your machine.

1456
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:05,180
Oh, it's even used port 9999.

1457
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:06,180
That's one of my favorites.

1458
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:07,700
I know it is.

1459
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:08,700
It is.

1460
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,780
That is always, that's always the one you use.

1461
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:12,220
So I just thought that was perfect for you.

1462
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:16,820
So it's at termbin.com and it's, it's actually pretty neat.

1463
01:13:16,820 --> 01:13:19,700
It's pretty slick and it's very simple to use to move stuff around.

1464
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,660
I'm using it right now.

1465
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:22,780
There you go.

1466
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:25,860
Also thank you to our members at unpluggedcore.com.

1467
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:28,080
You know, you get a special thank you.

1468
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:33,860
Every week we release two versions of the show just for you, a completely, totally inclusive

1469
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:38,100
version of the recording that is every time I mess up or the pre and post show that doesn't

1470
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,380
get recorded.

1471
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:40,380
All of that's in there.

1472
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:41,380
It's a stream capture.

1473
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:42,820
So you get the full experience.

1474
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:43,820
But you know what?

1475
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,060
Maybe you want something tighter, shorter.

1476
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:46,380
You got limited time.

1477
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:49,700
We also have the limited ad feed available to our members.

1478
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:51,040
Two choices for you.

1479
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:52,040
And thank you for being a member.

1480
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:55,540
It keeps us independent, helps reduce the ad load needed.

1481
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:59,800
And then from time to time you get extra little perks like discounts on the garage sale at

1482
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:02,260
unpluggedcore.com.

1483
01:14:02,260 --> 01:14:05,980
If you do the Twitter thing, you can follow the show at linuxunplugged.com.

1484
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:10,700
Wes is over there at Wes Bain and I'm at Chris LAS and the whole network for like news and

1485
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:14,700
stream information and log information at Jupiter signal.

1486
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:20,380
And then there's a whole network of fantastic shows over at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1487
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:24,160
And I'm going to just specifically, well, you know, really you can go to radio, self-hosted

1488
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:25,160
Linux action news.

1489
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,960
They are all such great companion shows to Linux Unplugged.

1490
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:34,820
Maybe save yourself some time, get the all shows feed, pro move, pro move, or really

1491
01:14:34,820 --> 01:14:36,620
get the fire hose and join us live.

1492
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:38,340
See you next week.

1493
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,780
Same bad time, same bad station.

1494
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:41,860
Join us on a Tuesday.

1495
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:46,580
We're typically live unless we're out hunting, taking photos of penguins and there's a calendar

1496
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:47,580
for that.

1497
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:48,580
Yep.

1498
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:51,220
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar links to everything we talked about today, how to

1499
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:54,820
contact us, the mumble, the matrix info, all of it.

1500
01:14:54,820 --> 01:15:00,660
What we've done is we've got a crack team to put it all together at linuxunplugged.com.

1501
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:04,700
Now it's a team of 15 at a cost of a hundred thousand dollars each.

1502
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:05,700
So it's a great expense.

1503
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:10,260
In fact, we're millions of dollars in the hole, but we have linuxunplugged.com for you,

1504
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:11,760
just for you.

1505
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:12,760
Thanks so much for joining us.

1506
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,760
That might not be true.

1507
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,940
In fact, none of that may be true.

1508
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:15,940
Go there, won't you?

1509
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:16,940
Find out.

1510
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:17,940
Thanks so much for joining us.

1511
01:15:17,940 --> 01:15:44,180
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1512
01:15:47,940 --> 01:16:01,620
Oh, I can't wait to see Drew.

1513
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:07,240
We are thinking about going to Colorado in August, and if we do that, we'll have a meetup

1514
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:08,240
while we're out there.

1515
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:13,260
So we can do so safely, which I think we'll probably be able to, and I am so looking forward

1516
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,260
to it.

1517
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:15,260
Oh man.

1518
01:16:15,260 --> 01:16:16,260
Really just.

1519
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:17,260
It's going to be good.

1520
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:18,260
It really is.

1521
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,980
It's going to be, it's going to be so great to see them.

1522
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:24,980
And the other thing I'd love to do while we're in Denver is I'd love to sneak over to the

1523
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:28,860
system 76 factory and see them put together one of those new launch keyboards since we've

1524
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:29,860
been there.

1525
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:32,780
I, you know, they, they gotta have the launch keyboard like all like, right?

1526
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:35,660
I mean, they could go in there and probably see everything, take a few pictures, have

1527
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:39,620
some secrets, maybe sneak a keyboard or two in our vests because I think I'll still be

1528
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:40,620
rocking the vest.

1529
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:41,620
Let's be honest.

1530
01:16:41,620 --> 01:16:47,740
I'm only wearing some extra vests just to fit the keyboards.
