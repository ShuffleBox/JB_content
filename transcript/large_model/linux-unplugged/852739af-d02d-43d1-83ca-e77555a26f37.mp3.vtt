WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.460
pre-ordered me a PinePhone.

00:02.460 --> 00:03.620
The Braveheart Edition.

00:03.620 --> 00:04.300
That's exciting.

00:04.300 --> 00:05.420
Did you get one, Cheesy?

00:05.420 --> 00:05.980
I did.

00:05.980 --> 00:07.020
I did, in fact, get one.

00:07.020 --> 00:08.980
I'm really looking forward to it.

00:08.980 --> 00:10.500
What about you, Wes?

00:10.500 --> 00:11.260
No.

00:11.260 --> 00:11.860
What?

00:11.860 --> 00:12.660
No, it's OK.

00:12.660 --> 00:14.300
You know, I'm going to let you guys deal

00:14.300 --> 00:17.060
with all the first-run defects, and I'm

00:17.060 --> 00:19.700
going to pick one up later after they've solved all those issues.

00:19.700 --> 00:22.100
So what you're saying is you don't have a Braveheart.

00:22.100 --> 00:22.740
Yeah, that's right.

00:22.740 --> 00:24.780
He's going to geek vicariously through us, Chees.

00:24.780 --> 00:25.460
It's OK.

00:25.460 --> 00:26.900
I'll be fine with that.

00:26.900 --> 00:38.660
Hello, friends, and welcome into Linux Unplugged, episode 328.

00:38.660 --> 00:39.340
My name is Chris.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.180
My name is Wes.

00:40.180 --> 00:41.300
Well, hello, Mr. Wes.

00:41.300 --> 00:44.540
Hello, things feel different today, but still the same.

00:44.540 --> 00:46.260
Yeah, a little fresher.

00:46.260 --> 00:46.780
I think so.

00:46.780 --> 00:47.340
Yeah, I think so.

00:47.340 --> 00:48.100
Energetic.

00:48.100 --> 00:50.800
Well, and it might just be that we have a great panel.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.460
Hello, Cheesy and Alex.

00:52.460 --> 00:53.100
Hello, hello.

00:53.100 --> 00:54.080
Hello there.

00:54.080 --> 00:54.580
Hello.

00:54.580 --> 00:55.420
Hello.

00:55.420 --> 00:56.980
We have a really fun show today.

00:56.980 --> 00:58.480
So we have some community news we're

00:58.480 --> 01:00.540
going to cover right here off the top.

01:00.540 --> 01:02.980
And then we're going to jump into Chees' experience

01:02.980 --> 01:06.140
at the System76 Superfan event.

01:06.140 --> 01:08.340
And it's like Chees Unplugged this week,

01:08.340 --> 01:10.340
because on top of that, Chees has been rocking

01:10.340 --> 01:12.020
the Pine Book Pro full time.

01:12.020 --> 01:14.660
So we're going to get his take on that and what he thinks.

01:14.660 --> 01:16.980
And to sort of round all of this off,

01:16.980 --> 01:18.940
the Pine64 community manager, Lucas,

01:18.940 --> 01:21.940
is going to join us to chat about the status of the project,

01:21.940 --> 01:25.140
where things are going, a little bit about this,

01:25.140 --> 01:26.520
a little bit about that.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.100
And then we're going to wrap it all up

01:28.100 --> 01:29.700
with some cool pics and all that kind of stuff

01:29.700 --> 01:30.580
that we always do.

01:30.580 --> 01:31.700
It's how we roll.

01:31.700 --> 01:32.280
Absolutely.

01:32.280 --> 01:33.480
I mean, we may not do a pic.

01:33.480 --> 01:33.980
We may.

01:33.980 --> 01:34.820
We may not.

01:34.820 --> 01:35.940
Sometimes I just sneak in there.

01:35.940 --> 01:40.060
Something I've been thinking about, adding to the show,

01:40.060 --> 01:41.940
and so I'm soliciting emails now,

01:41.940 --> 01:43.980
is I think I want to make a follow-up, a reoccurring

01:43.980 --> 01:46.120
thing for a little while, like a follow-up sprint.

01:46.120 --> 01:47.580
I mean, we've been doing this long enough, right?

01:47.580 --> 01:48.900
We should take advantage of it.

01:48.900 --> 01:52.300
As we round out 2019, I want to hear what the folks have

01:52.300 --> 01:55.620
to say, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

01:55.620 --> 01:57.500
If we get some emails, keep an eye out, Wes.

01:57.500 --> 02:00.580
If we get some emails coming in that are like follow-up items,

02:00.580 --> 02:02.100
in that segment, what I'd like to do

02:02.100 --> 02:04.420
is cover people's follow-up to what we've talked about.

02:04.420 --> 02:07.940
But also, if we have any additional notes to add,

02:07.940 --> 02:10.300
I want to talk about in that segment, too.

02:10.300 --> 02:12.580
Maybe we were running something for a little bit

02:12.580 --> 02:13.620
after we talked about it on the show,

02:13.620 --> 02:15.860
and we discovered something additional.

02:15.860 --> 02:17.260
That'd be where we'd slip that in.

02:17.260 --> 02:19.420
Something we might try, we'll give it a go.

02:19.420 --> 02:22.340
But it all depends on what you send us at linuxunplug.com

02:22.340 --> 02:23.540
slash contact.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.180
So let's kick things off with the news.

02:25.180 --> 02:26.900
But before we do that, we've got to say time,

02:26.900 --> 02:28.300
appropriate greetings to that mumble room.

02:28.300 --> 02:29.140
Hello.

02:29.140 --> 02:29.640
Hello.

02:29.640 --> 02:30.140
Hello.

02:30.140 --> 02:30.980
Hello.

02:30.980 --> 02:31.480
Aloha.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.700
Happy Linux Tuesday, everyone.

02:33.700 --> 02:34.820
Wow.

02:34.820 --> 02:39.340
You know, a big thank you to Brent, Byte, Neil, DM, Jill,

02:39.340 --> 02:44.300
Colonel, MiniMech, Stefan, and TC for joining us on a new time.

02:44.300 --> 02:44.900
New time.

02:44.900 --> 02:48.020
Noon Pacific over at jblive.tv on Tuesday.

02:48.020 --> 02:48.780
Same day, though.

02:48.780 --> 02:49.820
We won't leave you Tuesday.

02:49.820 --> 02:52.580
And also, we have an awesome IRC showing, too.

02:52.580 --> 02:54.820
I'm getting good first impressions.

02:54.820 --> 02:56.300
I was super nervous about this.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.100
All right, so let's talk about the news,

02:58.100 --> 03:00.780
starting with the good folks over at KDE.

03:00.780 --> 03:04.340
KDE EV, the corporation, or the entity, I guess I should say.

03:04.340 --> 03:06.900
The legal entity behind KDE.

03:06.900 --> 03:12.140
Is looking for a project manager to help them reach their goals.

03:12.140 --> 03:13.980
It's a PDF we have linked in the show notes.

03:13.980 --> 03:16.560
And in there, Wes, they say what their ideal candidate is.

03:16.560 --> 03:18.900
Yeah, well, hopefully, the ideal candidate

03:18.900 --> 03:21.340
is able to help the community in achieving its goals

03:21.340 --> 03:23.500
by being a reliable support system

03:23.500 --> 03:25.320
for all organizational matters.

03:25.320 --> 03:28.300
I mean, that includes delivering reports to the board,

03:28.300 --> 03:30.700
sort of being the person who's keeping track of all the things

03:30.700 --> 03:33.660
and making sure the projects got everything they need.

03:33.660 --> 03:34.820
You could really see how they could probably

03:34.820 --> 03:35.580
use somebody like that.

03:35.580 --> 03:36.940
That would improve communication.

03:36.940 --> 03:40.860
It would probably improve cross-project collaboration,

03:40.860 --> 03:44.180
help them unify some of their efforts.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.060
So if you think you might be a candidate that

03:46.060 --> 03:47.580
could help take the project to the next level,

03:47.580 --> 03:48.800
go check it out.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.780
I've spent the weekend again with Plasma just recently.

03:52.780 --> 03:53.820
It really is great.

03:53.820 --> 03:55.060
You know, I thought, I thought, boy.

03:55.060 --> 03:55.540
I can tell.

03:55.540 --> 03:56.620
I mean, you're glowing.

03:56.620 --> 03:57.500
I kind of.

03:57.500 --> 04:00.060
I just rediscovered just how wonderful it is,

04:00.060 --> 04:01.860
because I've been spending a lot of time with Gnome Shell.

04:01.860 --> 04:03.520
Because I need to do these things.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.060
I need to try it out.

04:05.060 --> 04:07.460
And so I had an opportunity to try out

04:07.460 --> 04:10.060
mangero Plasma Edition.

04:10.060 --> 04:12.460
I'm very impressed by what they've done.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.780
They've pre-installed some really great fonts.

04:14.780 --> 04:16.900
They're not necessarily all turned on or selected

04:16.900 --> 04:17.700
by default.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.340
But they are available for you to customize.

04:19.340 --> 04:21.660
Like some of my favorite editor fonts, my code editor fonts,

04:21.660 --> 04:23.020
and my favorite UI fonts.

04:23.020 --> 04:25.100
They're all there.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.660
It's such a great experience.

04:26.660 --> 04:27.620
And I'll tell you.

04:27.620 --> 04:29.660
You put it to me earlier, like that you avoided

04:29.660 --> 04:31.580
like a whole day of tinkering just because.

04:31.580 --> 04:34.060
Mangero just had such a great out-of-box.

04:34.060 --> 04:37.100
It's really nice when you see a good preset of Plasma.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.780
When you install just the Plasma meta package

04:39.780 --> 04:42.020
on a distribution like, say, Fedora,

04:42.020 --> 04:43.680
you get all of the bits and pieces,

04:43.680 --> 04:46.820
but maybe not all of the right default applications are set.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.940
And the UI is certainly atrocious.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.420
And it's just a very different experience.

04:51.420 --> 04:53.420
It's not living up to the potential of Plasma.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.940
And then you see something like mangero, and it's remarkable.

04:55.940 --> 04:58.620
And I'll tell you, what got me kicked off

04:58.620 --> 05:00.420
on this whole Plasma thread, other than I

05:00.420 --> 05:03.300
thought it was probably time I just gave it a fair check

05:03.300 --> 05:05.580
again, I don't know if you recall,

05:05.580 --> 05:09.260
but years ago on this show, I challenged

05:09.260 --> 05:12.260
you to get Linux working on a MacBook Pro.

05:12.260 --> 05:13.180
How could I ever forget?

05:13.180 --> 05:15.700
It was like a late 2013 MacBook Pro.

05:15.700 --> 05:16.780
It's one of these MacBooks.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.020
It's got a retina screen.

05:18.020 --> 05:19.420
It's got an i7 processor.

05:19.420 --> 05:24.020
It's got like a 512 gigabyte SSD.

05:24.020 --> 05:26.180
It's from the Narrowwind MacBook Pro, so nice.

05:26.180 --> 05:28.460
It's got ports, right?

05:28.460 --> 05:32.300
It's got all these things, and it's still a very nice machine.

05:32.300 --> 05:35.300
And mine happened to get a replacement battery

05:35.300 --> 05:37.100
a couple of years ago.

05:37.100 --> 05:40.620
It says the battery, when I ran a test, is at 94% capacity.

05:40.620 --> 05:42.740
Not bad for a 2013.

05:42.740 --> 05:45.660
However, it's not the greatest machine around,

05:45.660 --> 05:50.220
and Linux on a MacBook had some limitations.

05:50.220 --> 05:53.120
I mean, it's never the best experience you're going to get.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.740
And so it just really didn't get used much.

05:55.740 --> 05:58.580
It got put on a shelf, and about a year went by.

05:58.580 --> 06:01.540
And then we had our team sprint, and we cleaned out everything

06:01.540 --> 06:03.620
in the studio, and it got set out in the living room.

06:03.620 --> 06:05.580
But a mixer got set on top of it,

06:05.580 --> 06:08.180
and some cables got set on top of a small mixer,

06:08.180 --> 06:09.820
and it just got buried.

06:09.820 --> 06:12.540
I was going through the stuff Friday,

06:12.540 --> 06:14.420
and I see this old MacBook, and I'm like,

06:14.420 --> 06:16.140
is this the MacBook that's got Linux on it?

06:16.140 --> 06:17.020
And I pull it out.

06:17.020 --> 06:18.820
Literally, I have to dust it off, right?

06:18.820 --> 06:21.060
It's that dirty.

06:21.060 --> 06:25.460
I open it up, and it's dead, dead.

06:25.460 --> 06:28.780
So I plug it in, it boots for a second, and then dead.

06:28.780 --> 06:31.180
OK, I got to let this one sit for a while, which I knew.

06:31.180 --> 06:32.020
It's just I didn't.

06:32.020 --> 06:32.740
I don't care.

06:32.740 --> 06:35.740
So I plug it in, I let it sit for a couple of hours,

06:35.740 --> 06:38.580
open it back up, turn it on, and Arch boots up.

06:38.580 --> 06:41.020
Now, this Arch install, it says it's from 2016.

06:41.020 --> 06:42.220
Does that sound right to you?

06:42.220 --> 06:43.260
Is that possible?

06:43.260 --> 06:44.420
Yeah, maybe.

06:44.420 --> 06:46.300
2016?

06:46.300 --> 06:49.900
It feels like it was just a year ago I challenged you to that.

06:49.900 --> 06:51.060
Oh, my god.

06:51.060 --> 06:55.460
So anyways, I mean, the install says 2016.

06:55.460 --> 06:57.500
But it had been updated several times since then,

06:57.500 --> 07:02.860
so it had a rocking kernel 4.16.

07:02.860 --> 07:05.780
The current kernels we record this as 5.3.11.

07:05.780 --> 07:09.740
So it hadn't been updated since before the merger with Linux

07:09.740 --> 07:10.220
Academy.

07:10.220 --> 07:11.180
It had been a long time.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.540
I was opening up a time capsule.

07:12.540 --> 07:13.220
That's wild.

07:13.220 --> 07:14.340
It was really weird.

07:14.340 --> 07:16.260
So I didn't have any of my credentials logged

07:16.260 --> 07:17.620
into any of my Linux Academy accounts.

07:17.620 --> 07:19.940
I'm like, how am I going to work on this thing?

07:19.940 --> 07:23.260
And so I think to myself, is there any way

07:23.260 --> 07:24.420
this thing will upgrade?

07:24.420 --> 07:25.940
You mean you didn't reinstall it?

07:25.940 --> 07:27.020
I thought, no way, right?

07:27.020 --> 07:28.900
Because it's literally every single package

07:28.900 --> 07:30.540
has to be upgraded.

07:30.540 --> 07:32.780
And I thought, if I can run this upgrade,

07:32.780 --> 07:35.580
and it takes this install from over a year, maybe two years

07:35.580 --> 07:36.180
ago.

07:36.180 --> 07:37.220
Three years ago?

07:37.220 --> 07:37.740
Well, yeah.

07:37.740 --> 07:41.140
But I mean, the last update was probably two years ago.

07:41.140 --> 07:42.780
Maybe a year and a half.

07:42.780 --> 07:46.220
If it can successfully do that on a fricking MacBook,

07:46.220 --> 07:48.140
I will install Arch on my workstation.

07:48.140 --> 07:50.460
Because that's the ultimate benchmark.

07:50.460 --> 07:52.620
That's quite literally your forever install right there.

07:52.620 --> 07:53.620
You're done.

07:53.620 --> 07:55.620
So I ran it.

07:55.620 --> 07:57.160
I had to answer a bunch of questions

07:57.160 --> 07:59.980
about replacing packages and resolve some conflicts.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.180
But once it got up and going.

08:01.180 --> 08:03.780
Scrolling back through the Arch Linux main site for a while.

08:03.780 --> 08:04.980
Yeah, and even just going through my history,

08:04.980 --> 08:06.440
like, how did I solve this before?

08:06.440 --> 08:09.860
That kind of going through your Bash history.

08:09.860 --> 08:11.340
It took all day.

08:11.340 --> 08:14.960
But at the end of it, I rebooted that sucker.

08:14.960 --> 08:18.980
And it rebooted and logged in without a single error message

08:18.980 --> 08:23.060
to the latest plasma kernel 5.3.11,

08:23.060 --> 08:24.980
the latest graphics drivers.

08:24.980 --> 08:25.760
No big deal.

08:25.760 --> 08:26.740
Everything.

08:26.740 --> 08:27.260
Wow, dude.

08:27.260 --> 08:28.380
Everything was done.

08:28.380 --> 08:29.820
Not a single error message.

08:29.820 --> 08:33.620
Like, no plasma pop-up that says this can't load or anything.

08:33.620 --> 08:38.020
And I've been using it since, well, Friday evening,

08:38.020 --> 08:41.260
Saturday morning, as my work machine.

08:41.260 --> 08:42.660
And so I was like, well, all right,

08:42.660 --> 08:44.220
I'm going to put managerial plasma edition

08:44.220 --> 08:45.780
on my workstation here at the studio.

08:45.780 --> 08:46.420
And I did that.

08:46.420 --> 08:51.500
And just a reminder, there's so many great choices out there.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.380
And as part of this process, I've

08:53.380 --> 08:54.820
made a pledge to sort of document,

08:54.820 --> 08:57.780
like, if I hit any rough edges or bugs,

08:57.780 --> 08:58.980
I'm going to take the time now.

08:58.980 --> 09:01.600
Because I've gotten so fast now at setting up these desktops,

09:01.600 --> 09:03.860
I'm saving days of time that I used to spend.

09:03.860 --> 09:05.180
So I'm going to take some of that time

09:05.180 --> 09:05.860
to actually sit down.

09:05.860 --> 09:07.860
If I hit bugs, I'm going to go file a bug report.

09:07.860 --> 09:09.620
So I'm going to kind of do that part

09:09.620 --> 09:14.140
and try to get more out of this process than I normally do.

09:14.140 --> 09:16.060
But it has served as a good reminder

09:16.060 --> 09:20.260
that we have some really, really great options.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.980
And the KDE folks are really on to something.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.460
I don't know if it'll be my daily driver forever,

09:26.460 --> 09:27.820
but I really enjoy it.

09:27.820 --> 09:30.540
And so if you think you could help that project,

09:30.540 --> 09:33.420
we'll have a link to the show notes on how to apply.

09:33.420 --> 09:35.340
I'd love to see them take it to the next level.

09:35.340 --> 09:36.020
Absolutely.

09:36.020 --> 09:36.700
So fun.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.180
So speaking of great desktop environments, Gnome Shell,

09:39.180 --> 09:41.700
or Gnome Shell, they're starting something

09:41.700 --> 09:47.300
that I think is a brilliant public PR strategy.

09:47.300 --> 09:49.420
And a lot of projects should consider this.

09:49.420 --> 09:52.980
It's really kind of explaining their thought process

09:52.980 --> 09:55.980
on why they do what they do, what decisions they've made,

09:55.980 --> 09:56.900
and where they're going.

09:56.900 --> 10:00.220
They've launched a new blog, the development blog

10:00.220 --> 10:03.780
for specifically Gnome Shell and Mudder.

10:03.780 --> 10:05.340
They've just launched it.

10:05.340 --> 10:06.820
But they say on here, for a long time,

10:06.820 --> 10:08.540
the development of Mudder and Gnome Shell

10:08.540 --> 10:10.020
was surrounded by silence.

10:10.020 --> 10:12.060
This blog is a humble attempt to bring

10:12.060 --> 10:14.300
those two critical components of the Gnome Desktop

10:14.300 --> 10:18.460
to the spotlight, even if only a tiny bit more.

10:18.460 --> 10:20.700
They do go on to note that it would

10:20.700 --> 10:22.500
be naive to say that posts will be published

10:22.500 --> 10:24.820
in a consistent frequency.

10:24.820 --> 10:27.060
But the initial goal is monthly development reports

10:27.060 --> 10:30.980
and eventual one-shot deep dives into various bits and pieces

10:30.980 --> 10:33.300
of both components, which I'm really looking forward to.

10:33.300 --> 10:33.900
Yeah.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.660
I love learning the thought processes behind the decisions

10:37.660 --> 10:38.420
developers make.

10:38.420 --> 10:42.060
And it often, I think, leads to a much more informed

10:42.060 --> 10:44.020
conversation around those changes, where

10:44.020 --> 10:47.980
a lot of times when the project announces a change,

10:47.980 --> 10:49.820
it's met with strong reaction.

10:49.820 --> 10:50.340
Right.

10:50.340 --> 10:51.980
I mean, it may be something that developers

10:51.980 --> 10:53.060
have been thinking about for a long time,

10:53.060 --> 10:54.600
but the community has no way to know.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.660
And now there's a blog to check out.

10:56.660 --> 10:57.140
Yep.

10:57.140 --> 10:58.720
So we will link to that in the show notes.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.300
But more importantly than that, we're

11:00.300 --> 11:02.020
not keeping an eye on this.

11:02.020 --> 11:03.900
So I'll watch this for future developments.

11:03.900 --> 11:06.020
And if they have something really interesting,

11:06.020 --> 11:07.500
I'll try to do a breakdown here on the show.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.820
And then, of course, like we always do, source link it

11:09.820 --> 11:11.060
so you can find out more.

11:11.060 --> 11:12.340
That's how we do it.

11:12.340 --> 11:14.540
Links for this episode, linuxunplugged.com

11:14.540 --> 11:18.060
slash 328 for everything we're about to talk about.

11:18.060 --> 11:20.300
I think it's time to talk about cheesy going to Denver.

11:20.300 --> 11:23.900
So Mr. Cheese Bacon, you were our representative

11:23.900 --> 11:26.340
at the System76 Superfan event, an event

11:26.340 --> 11:27.980
I've attended in the past.

11:27.980 --> 11:31.860
And it's always a unique insight into a company

11:31.860 --> 11:34.500
that we talk a lot about in this space.

11:34.500 --> 11:38.280
They play a bigger and bigger role as their market grows.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.060
And so I'm really curious to hear some of your takeaways

11:41.060 --> 11:43.020
from the big Superfan event.

11:43.020 --> 11:45.220
Yeah, so the event was wonderful.

11:45.220 --> 11:47.020
And before I really get into any of that,

11:47.020 --> 11:50.100
I just wanted to give a couple of shout-outs to Carl, Emma,

11:50.100 --> 11:54.660
Mariah, Josh, Thomas, Aaron, Ian, Nate, Jeremy, Kate.

11:54.660 --> 11:58.540
I'm sure there's another 20 or 30 or so that I'm forgetting.

11:58.540 --> 12:00.780
But everyone there is so awesome.

12:00.780 --> 12:02.160
And it's so cool to be surrounded

12:02.160 --> 12:04.700
by people that are so passionate about what they're doing.

12:04.700 --> 12:07.100
And every single person there has that passion.

12:07.100 --> 12:10.180
So it's just great getting to meet everybody, for one.

12:10.180 --> 12:13.860
But yeah, I mean, there were some great takeaways, really

12:13.860 --> 12:16.460
three big ones.

12:16.460 --> 12:18.380
I was lucky enough, obviously, to be

12:18.380 --> 12:22.860
able to go and represent Jupiter Broadcasting and Linux Academy.

12:22.860 --> 12:27.900
And they ended up giving us all a Thaleo, which was phenomenal.

12:27.900 --> 12:28.860
You're kidding me.

12:28.860 --> 12:30.020
Totally unexpected.

12:30.020 --> 12:31.060
Absolutely unexpected.

12:31.060 --> 12:32.780
You're talking about a computer, right?

12:32.780 --> 12:34.940
I'm talking about the computer, yeah.

12:34.940 --> 12:36.520
Wow, that's incredible.

12:36.520 --> 12:37.020
It's great.

12:37.020 --> 12:39.260
And AMD donated all the chips.

12:39.260 --> 12:42.980
And Samsung donated all the NVME drives.

12:42.980 --> 12:44.660
And this is their revised version

12:44.660 --> 12:46.420
of the case, which is one of the takeaways.

12:46.420 --> 12:51.060
So there was a little humbub about the Thaleo

12:51.060 --> 12:54.700
having this resonant noise with the fans and stuff like that.

12:54.700 --> 12:57.100
So what they've done is, on the bottom of the case

12:57.100 --> 13:00.060
now, they've stretched the bottom of the case a little bit

13:00.060 --> 13:01.820
and included this flange that goes up

13:01.820 --> 13:04.980
along the side of the chassis itself, which

13:04.980 --> 13:07.620
reduces the decimal level.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.580
And under load, it's supposed to only be 33 decimals now.

13:11.580 --> 13:14.280
And to kind of put that into perspective,

13:14.280 --> 13:16.700
a whisper is about 30 decimals.

13:16.700 --> 13:20.780
So it should be considerably quiet.

13:20.780 --> 13:24.220
They've also adjusted the fan curves.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.860
And they're doing that with the IO board, which is pretty neat.

13:27.860 --> 13:32.980
So they're able to push different fan curves to that.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.720
And one of the things they told me was, whenever you get it,

13:35.720 --> 13:38.540
you need to update it so that you get that new fan

13:38.540 --> 13:39.700
curve in there.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.780
I think I'm not going to update it at first,

13:41.780 --> 13:44.060
just to see what it's like.

13:44.060 --> 13:45.860
And then update it to see if there's

13:45.860 --> 13:47.020
an audible difference there.

13:47.020 --> 13:48.820
That's a pretty remarkable thing.

13:48.820 --> 13:51.340
They custom laser engraved them, too.

13:51.340 --> 13:53.900
But that wasn't the only surprising announcement.

13:53.900 --> 13:57.620
Sounds like they have some huge plans for GNOME Shell.

13:57.620 --> 14:00.620
Yeah, so moving on, they have PopShell,

14:00.620 --> 14:01.780
is what they're calling it.

14:01.780 --> 14:02.980
It isn't yet on their GitHub.

14:02.980 --> 14:07.060
But it's supposed to be released with 2004.

14:07.060 --> 14:09.560
And essentially, what it is is it's a GNOME extension

14:09.560 --> 14:13.020
to create a tiling window manager experience in GNOME.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.540
i3-like experience?

14:14.540 --> 14:17.540
Very much i3-like.

14:17.540 --> 14:20.500
And while they wouldn't let us necessarily film that or take

14:20.500 --> 14:22.860
pictures of that, we did get kind of a sneak peek.

14:22.860 --> 14:25.460
And it's super-duper slick.

14:25.460 --> 14:26.020
Really?

14:26.020 --> 14:27.460
Something you'd be interested in trying?

14:27.460 --> 14:28.260
Absolutely.

14:28.260 --> 14:29.780
They're calling it PopShell, though.

14:29.780 --> 14:30.300
Mm-hmm.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.020
Yep, PopShell.

14:31.020 --> 14:32.020
Oh, man.

14:32.020 --> 14:33.620
That's a bold move.

14:33.620 --> 14:34.660
Wow.

14:34.660 --> 14:35.580
You had me at Tiling.

14:35.580 --> 14:36.260
I don't know.

14:36.260 --> 14:40.380
Yeah, if you're used to working without necessarily having

14:40.380 --> 14:42.000
to move your mouse around and stuff,

14:42.000 --> 14:43.300
and you're used to i3, I think it's

14:43.300 --> 14:45.180
going to be just one of those things that's

14:45.180 --> 14:48.660
going to be a natural extension for everyone

14:48.660 --> 14:49.780
to pick up and start using.

14:49.780 --> 14:52.260
Or if you just want to get into kind of a tiling window manager

14:52.260 --> 14:54.560
experience, I think that'll be a great place to start.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.060
Sure.

14:55.060 --> 14:59.140
And on the heels of that, so within the next couple

14:59.140 --> 15:01.340
of years, one of the other things they revealed

15:01.340 --> 15:05.540
is that they're going to start making their own laptops.

15:05.540 --> 15:08.260
So they had a big roundtable of what everyone would kind of

15:08.260 --> 15:09.540
like to see in a laptop.

15:09.540 --> 15:11.840
And of course, by the time it got round-tabled

15:11.840 --> 15:14.460
by all of these Linux nerds, the laptop

15:14.460 --> 15:16.540
would have cost about $8,000 to make.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.300
But it sounds like my kind of machine.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.480
Yeah, but I mean, it was everything, right?

15:20.480 --> 15:22.860
They really wanted to know what users want

15:22.860 --> 15:25.700
and what the fans would like to see in a laptop.

15:25.700 --> 15:28.540
And whenever I say they're going to make a laptop,

15:28.540 --> 15:30.340
yes, they already do make laptops,

15:30.340 --> 15:34.580
but they're actually going to use their new laser

15:34.580 --> 15:38.260
cutter, which you can add additional tooling to.

15:38.260 --> 15:41.740
So they will really be making their own chassis

15:41.740 --> 15:43.300
and putting this inside of there.

15:43.300 --> 15:46.500
There's even hints of maybe including a little touch

15:46.500 --> 15:49.220
of wood accents like they do with the Thaleo.

15:49.220 --> 15:50.500
Oh, that'd be sweet.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.580
Yes, so they're really thinking about all of that.

15:52.580 --> 15:56.100
And I think with the Nome, with the Popshell,

15:56.100 --> 15:59.020
paired with a new laptop really makes sense for them.

15:59.020 --> 16:02.940
And I think it's the next logical step for them.

16:02.940 --> 16:05.860
Their new laser machine is called the, I love it,

16:05.860 --> 16:09.780
it's called the TruMatic 1000.

16:09.780 --> 16:11.800
So I'm really looking forward to what

16:11.800 --> 16:13.420
they have coming down the pipe.

16:13.420 --> 16:15.580
If there's one company that could do amazing things

16:15.580 --> 16:18.300
with the laser cutter, it's System76.

16:18.300 --> 16:20.420
I've been a customer for 14 years,

16:20.420 --> 16:24.020
and they don't sponsor us.

16:24.020 --> 16:25.740
They haven't been a sponsor since last.

16:25.740 --> 16:29.300
And I still recommend people go to System76

16:29.300 --> 16:31.300
and check out what they have, because the culture

16:31.300 --> 16:34.580
behind those products is one that it's going to endure.

16:34.580 --> 16:35.820
I mean, they're users themselves.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.420
They care a lot about what they make, and it really shows.

16:38.420 --> 16:40.780
The thing I've noticed, and this, I think,

16:40.780 --> 16:43.660
tells you something, over that 14 years

16:43.660 --> 16:45.660
is I'm still talking to a lot of the same people

16:45.660 --> 16:48.580
I was talking to back then.

16:48.580 --> 16:50.540
People, they stick around, and they really

16:50.540 --> 16:52.380
become part of that company.

16:52.380 --> 16:54.420
And what I've been fascinated with,

16:54.420 --> 16:58.660
and it really comes across in Brent's brunch with Emma,

16:58.660 --> 17:01.540
that was just released, I think, this morning,

17:01.540 --> 17:04.380
is how she has been able to build new roles

17:04.380 --> 17:08.340
and grow while staying with that family and that company.

17:08.340 --> 17:12.400
And that's also a really unique opportunity.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.780
So you get a really great insight into their company

17:15.780 --> 17:18.500
culture with that extra that just came out.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.660
If you're fascinated at all, I really recommend it.

17:20.660 --> 17:24.580
Extra.extras.show slash 33.

17:24.580 --> 17:27.980
This company is an important part of the Linux ecosystem.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.660
And Brent, your chat with Emma, I think,

17:30.660 --> 17:32.860
really gave us a new level of insight

17:32.860 --> 17:36.060
into what somebody, we talk about Emma,

17:36.060 --> 17:38.300
who's been on the show a lot, does day to day.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.020
Well done, sir.

17:39.020 --> 17:39.780
Well, thank you.

17:39.780 --> 17:42.180
Yeah, I mean, her and I had a great fun chat,

17:42.180 --> 17:44.940
but there's also a lot of really cool transparency

17:44.940 --> 17:47.860
about stuff I learned about System76,

17:47.860 --> 17:50.740
all the stuff that happens behind the scene about making

17:50.740 --> 17:55.020
people feel amazing about the work they do, which is great.

17:55.020 --> 17:57.300
I mean, she's the happiness manager there.

17:57.300 --> 17:59.220
I think she's onto a few life secrets, to tell you the truth.

17:59.220 --> 18:00.620
She's got a few things figured out.

18:00.620 --> 18:02.700
Yeah, there are some true gems in there, for sure.

18:02.700 --> 18:03.940
I think the audience might recall,

18:03.940 --> 18:06.240
if you've been listening to the show for a little bit,

18:06.240 --> 18:09.400
that she had quite the medical situation

18:09.400 --> 18:10.700
at the beginning of summer.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.660
And that's why she had been absent for the show

18:12.660 --> 18:13.740
for a long time.

18:13.740 --> 18:14.620
And that's covered in there, too,

18:14.620 --> 18:15.620
now that she's on the other side of that.

18:15.620 --> 18:16.980
It's good to hear.

18:16.980 --> 18:20.020
Extras.show slash 33.

18:20.020 --> 18:21.580
Well, how about that?

18:21.580 --> 18:24.340
Mr. Cheese breaking the bacon there with the news,

18:24.340 --> 18:26.800
with the i3 tiling window manager and the laptop

18:26.800 --> 18:27.380
prototypes.

18:27.380 --> 18:28.780
Like, there you go.

18:28.780 --> 18:31.020
It was smart of us to send our best person over there.

18:31.020 --> 18:32.420
Yeah, Mr. Bacon will have to keep us

18:32.420 --> 18:35.220
apprised on all future Denver things that develop

18:35.220 --> 18:36.980
as our correspondent over there.

18:36.980 --> 18:39.100
And maybe some follow up about how that Thaleo

18:39.100 --> 18:39.940
ends up performing.

18:39.940 --> 18:41.660
Oh, yeah, that would be good.

18:41.660 --> 18:44.500
Yeah, well, yeah, good thinking, Wes.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.140
You know what?

18:45.140 --> 18:48.060
You know what else is a good idea?

18:48.060 --> 18:49.460
A little housekeeping.

18:49.460 --> 18:50.140
You got to do it.

18:50.140 --> 18:51.020
You got to do it every now and then.

18:51.020 --> 18:51.700
Keep things clean.

18:51.700 --> 18:54.020
We got a new Showtime we want to let you know about.

18:54.020 --> 18:56.420
You probably already knew, but it's worth mentioning again.

18:56.420 --> 18:58.220
Repetition is the key to success.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.020
We're now doing it noon Pacific time.

19:00.020 --> 19:02.700
You can get that converted to jupiterbroadcasting.com.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.500
It's not a calendar.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.500
jbliv.tv is where you watch it.

19:06.500 --> 19:10.580
irc.geekshed.net pound hashtag Jupiter Broadcasting.

19:10.580 --> 19:11.300
Yeah, join us live.

19:11.300 --> 19:13.980
It's a whole other level of experience.

19:13.980 --> 19:14.740
It's a lot of fun.

19:14.740 --> 19:18.860
I mean, there's probably a show on each end of this

19:18.860 --> 19:21.780
that doesn't make it out on the recording.

19:21.780 --> 19:24.980
I also thought I would tease a little something something.

19:24.980 --> 19:26.340
Coming up soon in the actress' week,

19:26.340 --> 19:28.380
we were just mentioning the interview with Emma.

19:28.380 --> 19:29.060
Right.

19:29.060 --> 19:30.020
Brunch with Emma.

19:30.020 --> 19:31.260
Brunch with Emma.

19:31.260 --> 19:34.540
Cheese and Popey sat down and talked about ThinkPads.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.900
We've all been waiting for this.

19:36.900 --> 19:41.220
If you want to hear Popey in his truly happy place,

19:41.220 --> 19:44.460
it's when he's talking about ThinkPads.

19:44.460 --> 19:46.660
I'm really nervous, because I just

19:46.660 --> 19:50.560
pulled the trigger on a gift for a family member,

19:50.560 --> 19:52.100
and it's a used ThinkPad.

19:52.100 --> 19:53.900
And I want to make sure I got the right one.

19:53.900 --> 19:56.420
So I will be listening carefully to that extras,

19:56.420 --> 19:57.620
in case I got to return it.

19:57.620 --> 19:59.540
So that'll be at extras.show.

19:59.540 --> 20:01.420
That's coming up probably later this week.

20:01.420 --> 20:03.980
I say probably like we don't already know.

20:03.980 --> 20:04.580
Stay tuned.

20:04.580 --> 20:06.420
You got to wait, expectantly.

20:06.420 --> 20:08.860
I'm just like, if I say it, then it really has to happen.

20:08.860 --> 20:10.700
So I'm like, probably, even though we already

20:10.700 --> 20:13.060
have it scheduled to launch.

20:13.060 --> 20:14.780
That's how I play it sometimes.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.980
So extras.show for that.

20:16.980 --> 20:20.740
And I'm really, really looking forward to the ThinkPad thing.

20:20.740 --> 20:22.500
And that brunch was fantastic.

20:22.500 --> 20:23.940
You got to go get that.

20:23.940 --> 20:27.020
All of it's available probably by about now,

20:27.020 --> 20:29.940
as you're listening to this.

20:29.940 --> 20:32.600
And that's the housekeeping this week, because it's not much.

20:32.600 --> 20:36.260
We got to talk about Pinebooks and Pine phones.

20:36.260 --> 20:39.660
On this trip to the System76 superfan event,

20:39.660 --> 20:42.260
Mr. Bacon took only one machine with him,

20:42.260 --> 20:45.020
and it was his Pinebook Pro.

20:45.020 --> 20:47.260
How's that been living with?

20:47.260 --> 20:49.300
I mean, honestly, a pretty nice machine.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.540
But let's be honest, you got nicer computers

20:51.540 --> 20:52.820
you could take with you, cheese.

20:52.820 --> 20:54.220
You got nicer machines.

20:54.220 --> 20:57.260
Yeah, I mean, I definitely have more powerful machines,

20:57.260 --> 21:00.780
and machines that might be considered nicer, per se.

21:00.780 --> 21:03.060
But the Pinebook really is a solid device.

21:03.060 --> 21:05.300
Yeah, maybe nicer is not a fair way to say it, is it?

21:05.300 --> 21:06.700
It's almost maybe powerful.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.620
But design-wise, feel-wise, is it pretty nice?

21:09.620 --> 21:10.140
It is.

21:10.140 --> 21:11.780
It's a really solid little machine.

21:11.780 --> 21:14.180
I think a lot of people could get behind it.

21:14.180 --> 21:18.460
The Chromium OS build that I was using for just YouTubing

21:18.460 --> 21:21.980
and the likes worked out great.

21:21.980 --> 21:25.260
I was able to actually bring the device to System76

21:25.260 --> 21:28.340
and put it in front of Carl and Jeremy and Emma

21:28.340 --> 21:32.460
and let them kind of nerd out on it a little bit.

21:32.460 --> 21:34.820
And they all appreciated it and where it's going.

21:34.820 --> 21:37.300
So it was really cool to kind of cross

21:37.300 --> 21:40.540
bounds between one hardware software vendor

21:40.540 --> 21:42.140
with another hardware software vendor

21:42.140 --> 21:45.940
and put these pieces in front of these other people.

21:45.940 --> 21:48.620
So I've had pretty good success with it so far.

21:48.620 --> 21:52.500
I haven't had really any major issues with my sole device.

21:52.500 --> 21:53.820
So it's about, what, two pounds?

21:53.820 --> 21:55.140
That makes it pretty nice for travel.

21:55.140 --> 21:56.180
Yeah, super lightweight.

21:56.180 --> 21:57.980
How'd the old battery do on the flight watching

21:57.980 --> 21:58.980
the videos and stuff?

21:58.980 --> 21:59.940
Oh, it did great, man.

21:59.940 --> 22:01.980
It really did wonderful.

22:01.980 --> 22:04.820
Averaging six to eight hours of battery life.

22:04.820 --> 22:07.940
I only charged it up once while I was there.

22:07.940 --> 22:09.940
And that was with everybody else tinkering with it

22:09.940 --> 22:13.300
and playing with it and the commute on the flight

22:13.300 --> 22:14.780
and all that sort of stuff as well.

22:14.780 --> 22:16.060
And it felt pretty solid in the bag,

22:16.060 --> 22:17.860
like it wasn't going to get bent or dinged up or anything?

22:17.860 --> 22:18.980
No, absolutely not.

22:18.980 --> 22:20.620
Absolutely not.

22:20.620 --> 22:21.140
All right.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.940
And no fan while you're watching the videos?

22:22.940 --> 22:23.180
No.

22:23.180 --> 22:24.700
So it's passively cooled so you don't

22:24.700 --> 22:27.300
have to worry about any fan noise or anything like that.

22:27.300 --> 22:29.180
I will say you probably want to use some headphones

22:29.180 --> 22:30.820
because the speakers are down firing

22:30.820 --> 22:32.140
and they're just not that great.

22:32.140 --> 22:34.900
It's rare to find a laptop that that's not true for, really.

22:34.900 --> 22:36.740
Hey, Cheese, how's the monitor on that thing?

22:36.740 --> 22:38.660
I know you and I were talking about it.

22:38.660 --> 22:39.700
It's really great, man.

22:39.700 --> 22:42.020
It's a 1080p IPS display.

22:42.020 --> 22:45.540
Viewing angles are solid.

22:45.540 --> 22:48.260
4K video playback, 60 frames a second.

22:48.260 --> 22:49.780
I think you can even bump.

22:49.780 --> 22:52.740
The screen is even rated at 120 hertz.

22:52.740 --> 22:55.900
So you can bump it to 120 hertz.

22:55.900 --> 22:56.900
I mean, it works great.

22:56.900 --> 22:58.700
It's a pretty reasonable price as well, right?

22:58.700 --> 22:59.940
Yeah, $200.

22:59.940 --> 23:01.740
You could make it a Chromebook if you want

23:01.740 --> 23:03.100
using builds that are available.

23:03.100 --> 23:05.340
Or you could run, for example, we'll

23:05.340 --> 23:07.220
have a link in the show notes, Manjaro just

23:07.220 --> 23:11.660
released a third preview of their Pinebook Pro Spin, which

23:11.660 --> 23:13.940
you can use Plasma or XFCE.

23:13.940 --> 23:18.820
And I've been working with Fred from the Manjaro team that's

23:18.820 --> 23:20.540
been helping with these builds.

23:20.540 --> 23:22.700
And I've been testing it out since the first preview.

23:22.700 --> 23:25.860
And each iteration, it just gets better and better and better.

23:25.860 --> 23:27.900
So it's definitely a distribution

23:27.900 --> 23:30.660
I think a lot of people would gravitate to just because

23:30.660 --> 23:33.540
of the Arch64 support.

23:33.540 --> 23:37.020
Well, and they have a great Plasma experience.

23:37.020 --> 23:38.500
I can testify to that.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.540
But that's sort of what appeals to me about the Pinebook.

23:41.540 --> 23:43.660
$200, great travel machine.

23:43.660 --> 23:45.660
It could be as simple as a Chromebook or as advanced

23:45.660 --> 23:47.660
as a Manjaro workstation.

23:47.660 --> 23:51.140
So the question is, where is this at as a project?

23:51.140 --> 23:52.900
Where are they at in the pipeline?

23:52.900 --> 23:54.620
Well, Joe and Cheese had an opportunity

23:54.620 --> 23:56.740
to sit down with Lucas, the community manager

23:56.740 --> 24:01.260
over at Pine64, and talk about that and many other things.

24:01.260 --> 24:01.940
So hey, Lucas.

24:01.940 --> 24:02.780
How's it going, man?

24:02.780 --> 24:03.260
Good.

24:03.260 --> 24:04.180
Hey, what's up?

24:04.180 --> 24:05.100
Oh, not much.

24:05.100 --> 24:06.540
Glad to have you on here.

24:06.540 --> 24:08.300
So Lucas, I know that you guys have been

24:08.300 --> 24:10.660
shipping a ton of Pinebooks.

24:10.660 --> 24:13.380
I believe I was in the second batch.

24:13.380 --> 24:15.860
But what exactly is going on with the batch numbers?

24:15.860 --> 24:18.740
And where are we at right now in the process of shipping

24:18.740 --> 24:20.340
that hardware out to people?

24:20.340 --> 24:22.900
So we're currently on the third batch.

24:22.900 --> 24:24.820
It also happens to be the first batch which

24:24.820 --> 24:29.740
ships with a choice of both ISO and ANSI keyboards.

24:29.740 --> 24:35.060
So that's for our UK and US end users.

24:35.060 --> 24:40.580
And starting from early next year, we're going to take a break.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.900
There's the Chinese year coming up.

24:42.900 --> 24:48.060
And then next batches will follow in March of 2020.

24:48.060 --> 24:50.660
And that's the ones that are being ordered at the moment?

24:50.660 --> 24:52.500
Those which are being ordered right now

24:52.500 --> 24:55.100
should be shipping in December and January.

24:55.100 --> 24:56.100
All right, cool.

24:56.100 --> 24:57.700
One thing that I was curious about,

24:57.700 --> 25:01.220
I know that there's been a few hardware issues reported,

25:01.220 --> 25:04.340
namely the trackpad, and that you guys are currently

25:04.340 --> 25:07.820
working on some firmware patches for that.

25:07.820 --> 25:09.460
Can we expect when that'll be fixed?

25:09.460 --> 25:13.180
And are there any other hardware-related issues

25:13.180 --> 25:14.740
that you've seen now that these are

25:14.740 --> 25:16.340
landing in the hands of people?

25:16.340 --> 25:19.820
So in terms of the trackpad, we have

25:19.820 --> 25:21.460
been now aware for a couple of weeks

25:21.460 --> 25:22.820
that there is an issue with it.

25:22.820 --> 25:25.380
So there are two sort of separate aspects

25:25.380 --> 25:27.420
to the trackpad problem.

25:27.420 --> 25:31.140
One is more of a luxury problem, which

25:31.140 --> 25:33.940
is that it's not very precise at this point in time.

25:33.940 --> 25:35.940
But then there is a more serious problem

25:35.940 --> 25:39.140
that it cuts out the functioning of the keyboard.

25:39.140 --> 25:42.340
Now, we already have solved the core problem,

25:42.340 --> 25:45.220
which is that it cuts out people when they're typing.

25:45.220 --> 25:48.100
So when your palm touches the trackpad,

25:48.100 --> 25:50.180
as you type on the laptop, it basically

25:50.180 --> 25:53.820
cuts out the keyboard, preventing you from typing.

25:53.820 --> 25:57.900
So we have that done, but we still

25:57.900 --> 26:01.620
are working at improving precision of the trackpad

26:01.620 --> 26:04.900
because this is something we know people also want.

26:04.900 --> 26:09.900
Now, because you are effectively flashing an SPI chip that

26:09.900 --> 26:13.380
is on the keyboard itself, we don't want people

26:13.380 --> 26:16.060
to do this too many times.

26:16.060 --> 26:18.060
So now that we have the fix, we're

26:18.060 --> 26:19.620
going to work for a little bit longer,

26:19.620 --> 26:21.620
for a couple of days, maybe a week or so,

26:21.620 --> 26:23.980
to improve the precision of the trackpad.

26:23.980 --> 26:25.820
And then we're going to think of a way

26:25.820 --> 26:28.140
so that it could be bundled in some simple way

26:28.140 --> 26:31.580
across different distributions and pushed to end users.

26:31.580 --> 26:34.980
So I'll vaguely say it should be out there within 10 days.

26:34.980 --> 26:36.740
But this isn't an actual hardware problem.

26:36.740 --> 26:38.220
It's just a software problem, right?

26:38.220 --> 26:40.420
It's specifically a firmware problem.

26:40.420 --> 26:41.940
Right, so it can be fixed.

26:41.940 --> 26:42.780
Oh, absolutely.

26:42.780 --> 26:48.700
And we have, as we promised, the flashing utility

26:48.700 --> 26:51.620
has been open sourced under MIT license.

26:51.620 --> 26:54.380
It's already available, compiled,

26:54.380 --> 26:57.620
and we know that it's working.

26:57.620 --> 27:00.500
So it's just a question of getting the firmware right.

27:00.500 --> 27:03.700
And I'm very confident we'll be able to get

27:03.700 --> 27:06.300
the correct firmware working at its optimal

27:06.300 --> 27:08.780
within a couple of days.

27:08.780 --> 27:11.260
So moving on from the Pine Book itself,

27:11.260 --> 27:14.500
I know a lot of our listeners are extremely

27:14.500 --> 27:17.140
excited about the Pine phone.

27:17.140 --> 27:19.260
And I know that dev kits have been going out,

27:19.260 --> 27:23.060
and you guys are starting to ramp up production for that.

27:23.060 --> 27:25.760
Who currently has one of these development devices?

27:25.760 --> 27:28.580
And when can the rest of us expect to get one?

27:28.580 --> 27:32.020
So currently, there are a handful of developers

27:32.020 --> 27:34.420
from the core projects.

27:34.420 --> 27:40.380
That would be Ubuntu Touch, from Post Market OS,

27:40.380 --> 27:45.700
Sailfish, who have the actual finished phone prototypes.

27:45.700 --> 27:49.380
More developers will be getting their phones within a week

27:49.380 --> 27:51.300
or so from now.

27:51.300 --> 27:53.580
We expect to have them all shipped

27:53.580 --> 27:56.380
by the 20th of November.

27:56.380 --> 27:58.100
But development has been going on.

27:58.100 --> 28:04.340
We have had development kits out for about half a year now.

28:04.340 --> 28:06.660
So development has been ongoing.

28:06.660 --> 28:09.180
There have been some changes from the dev kits

28:09.180 --> 28:12.460
to these dev phones, and therefore, we

28:12.460 --> 28:16.740
need to provide developers with hardware which

28:16.740 --> 28:20.300
reflects these changes so they can adjust the software.

28:20.300 --> 28:23.540
As for when end users can get their hands on it,

28:23.540 --> 28:27.580
in general, in March of 2020.

28:27.580 --> 28:32.940
But if you are one of those people who enjoys beta testing

28:32.940 --> 28:36.780
and giving feedback to developers,

28:36.780 --> 28:42.980
want to be a part of the process, then on November 15,

28:42.980 --> 28:45.980
the Braveheart Edition, as we call it,

28:45.980 --> 28:48.340
so this is an early adopter edition,

28:48.340 --> 28:51.140
is opening with a limited amount of phones.

28:51.140 --> 28:54.460
I don't know exactly how many, but about 4,000 phones.

28:54.460 --> 28:58.780
And we expect those phones to ship by end of January 2020.

28:58.780 --> 29:00.700
So that was the end of last week as people

29:00.700 --> 29:01.820
are listening to this.

29:01.820 --> 29:03.820
So it's already available to order,

29:03.820 --> 29:06.100
except that it might be sold out if you've only

29:06.100 --> 29:08.020
got a limited number of them available then.

29:08.020 --> 29:11.460
I expect that it probably is sold out now in the future.

29:11.460 --> 29:15.460
Yeah, in the future of when this goes out.

29:15.460 --> 29:18.460
So what's the default OS going to be on these phones,

29:18.460 --> 29:21.420
and what kind of state is it going to be in?

29:21.420 --> 29:23.660
Are you asking specifically about the Braveheart Edition

29:23.660 --> 29:24.140
then?

29:24.140 --> 29:24.660
Yeah.

29:24.660 --> 29:29.300
There won't be an OS default on these phones.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.020
I mean, we expect that those people who

29:31.020 --> 29:35.740
will be getting these phones are, first of all,

29:35.740 --> 29:41.020
capable enough to interact with the developers,

29:41.020 --> 29:43.860
find the builds, and flash them themselves.

29:43.860 --> 29:45.980
So as I said, this is for enthusiasts

29:45.980 --> 29:49.700
who know that they want this phone months

29:49.700 --> 29:52.020
ahead of everyone else.

29:52.020 --> 29:55.540
And there is no such thing as a finished OS

29:55.540 --> 29:56.540
at this point in time.

29:56.540 --> 29:59.500
They're all lacking something.

29:59.500 --> 30:03.900
So I think that currently, perhaps the most polished

30:03.900 --> 30:06.820
operating system that I've seen is probably

30:06.820 --> 30:10.780
either post-market OS with the KDE Plasma Mobile

30:10.780 --> 30:12.140
or Ubuntu Touch.

30:12.140 --> 30:15.700
But they are not daily driver ready by any means then?

30:15.700 --> 30:18.660
As of today, I probably wouldn't advise anyone

30:18.660 --> 30:21.940
to use them as daily drivers now.

30:21.940 --> 30:24.100
But they're not far off, to be fair.

30:24.100 --> 30:27.900
Their performance is very good already.

30:27.900 --> 30:31.180
And most of the key functionality is there.

30:31.180 --> 30:35.100
I think that as of today, the one thing that is not

30:35.100 --> 30:38.180
functional is the front facing camera.

30:38.180 --> 30:44.100
Now, core functionality will differ from one distribution

30:44.100 --> 30:45.380
to another.

30:45.380 --> 30:48.580
But there are at least two distributions

30:48.580 --> 30:50.420
which have the modem working.

30:50.420 --> 30:53.500
And I think that voice calls have

30:53.500 --> 30:57.540
been activated at least in one, specifically in Ubuntu Touch.

30:57.540 --> 31:02.260
So in March, when these ship out to the rest of the world,

31:02.260 --> 31:03.700
what default OS?

31:03.700 --> 31:06.180
Are you just going to wait to see how they all

31:06.180 --> 31:11.060
start to flush out and what's ready to be a daily driver?

31:11.060 --> 31:13.180
This is one possibility.

31:13.180 --> 31:16.420
We said some time ago that what we want to do

31:16.420 --> 31:21.340
is run these OS-specific campaigns where

31:21.340 --> 31:23.820
we would customize the phones ever so slightly,

31:23.820 --> 31:30.500
maybe use the partner project's caller or something

31:30.500 --> 31:36.580
to this effect, and ship the phone with that OS on it.

31:36.580 --> 31:39.660
So if we were to ship post-market OS,

31:39.660 --> 31:43.300
it would have a green back cover.

31:43.300 --> 31:45.500
If it would be Ubuntu Touch, it would

31:45.500 --> 31:48.980
be coming with an orange back cover

31:48.980 --> 31:50.500
and Ubuntu Touch pre-installed.

31:50.500 --> 31:54.660
And then a portion of the money from those shipments

31:54.660 --> 31:57.500
would be going to these developers.

31:57.500 --> 32:00.740
So we're exploring, if it will be possible,

32:00.740 --> 32:05.180
we hope to ship with one of these bigger

32:05.180 --> 32:07.340
OSes from partner projects.

32:07.340 --> 32:09.540
But by and large, it's up in the air.

32:09.540 --> 32:12.340
We'll see how it all shapes up at this point in time.

32:12.340 --> 32:15.540
You went into this phone project presumably with your eyes

32:15.540 --> 32:18.180
open, knowing how difficult it was going to be.

32:18.180 --> 32:20.220
But has it proven even more difficult

32:20.220 --> 32:21.980
than you thought then?

32:21.980 --> 32:23.140
That's a good question.

32:23.140 --> 32:27.860
I think the answer is both yes and no.

32:27.860 --> 32:29.820
I always thought that software is

32:29.820 --> 32:34.460
going to be, in effect, harder because people, regardless

32:34.460 --> 32:36.220
of the price tag on this thing, people

32:36.220 --> 32:40.460
will want to have relatively good performance.

32:40.460 --> 32:42.500
But developers have really stepped up the game,

32:42.500 --> 32:47.660
and things run as well as they'll ever run on this hardware.

32:47.660 --> 32:49.540
It's really good.

32:49.540 --> 32:54.180
I don't want to say that it rivals a modern day Android

32:54.180 --> 32:59.220
phone, but it's absolutely smooth enough for testing

32:59.220 --> 33:00.940
and trying out Linux on a phone.

33:00.940 --> 33:07.260
And I can conceivably see people using this on a daily basis

33:07.260 --> 33:07.780
now.

33:07.780 --> 33:11.380
This is how good these distributions have gotten.

33:11.380 --> 33:14.580
Now, we knew that hardware is going to be difficult.

33:14.580 --> 33:17.980
But if you haven't made a phone, you just

33:17.980 --> 33:20.460
don't realize the complexity of it,

33:20.460 --> 33:23.900
even if you're told how complex it will be.

33:23.900 --> 33:25.580
It's extremely difficult.

33:25.580 --> 33:28.180
I'm just really happy that we didn't go in a route where

33:28.180 --> 33:32.140
we would make some really complex and difficult phone,

33:32.140 --> 33:38.220
which would definitely prove to be an unimaginable challenge.

33:38.220 --> 33:41.140
How free is this phone going to be in terms of drivers

33:41.140 --> 33:43.100
and binary blobs and stuff like that?

33:43.100 --> 33:44.900
How open source is it going to be?

33:44.900 --> 33:49.620
So everything on the root file system is completely free.

33:49.620 --> 33:52.820
This includes the graphics driver.

33:52.820 --> 33:54.620
So that's running Lima.

33:54.620 --> 33:58.980
On the phone itself, the modem is running proprietary firmware.

33:58.980 --> 34:03.260
There is some code in the out-of-focus

34:03.260 --> 34:07.580
of the rear-facing camera that is also proprietary.

34:07.580 --> 34:12.540
The firmware for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, not the drivers,

34:12.540 --> 34:15.180
but the firmware is proprietary.

34:15.180 --> 34:19.100
And it is my understanding that a part of the boot ROM

34:19.100 --> 34:21.940
firmware, which lives actually on the SOC,

34:21.940 --> 34:24.500
is locked down as well.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.700
And that's the extent of it.

34:26.700 --> 34:29.980
So some of this can conceivably in the future

34:29.980 --> 34:32.540
be freed, such as the camera.

34:32.540 --> 34:37.740
And if somebody decides to take a crack at the Bluetooth

34:37.740 --> 34:42.820
and Wi-Fi module, then presumably it's possible.

34:42.820 --> 34:46.340
In respect to the modem, we know that it is running Linux.

34:46.340 --> 34:49.540
But it's locked down.

34:49.540 --> 34:55.180
And this portion of the first stage bootloader,

34:55.180 --> 34:56.980
it's a part of the SOC.

34:56.980 --> 34:58.100
It can be freed.

34:58.100 --> 35:00.900
Well, that's just pretty much how it goes with any sort

35:00.900 --> 35:03.060
of mobile hardware, right?

35:03.060 --> 35:05.380
You can't expect it to be completely free.

35:05.380 --> 35:06.300
No, absolutely.

35:06.300 --> 35:09.780
And if there would be alternatives

35:09.780 --> 35:14.580
that we could choose that would be easier to free or otherwise,

35:14.580 --> 35:17.780
then we would obviously have gone that route.

35:17.780 --> 35:20.180
But this is the reality of things.

35:20.180 --> 35:25.620
This is our first sort of step in understanding

35:25.620 --> 35:27.540
how phones are made.

35:27.540 --> 35:29.540
And this is a very ambitious project.

35:29.540 --> 35:34.460
So in the future, there's also room

35:34.460 --> 35:38.260
for us to try out different things and different modules

35:38.260 --> 35:44.460
and alter the existing PinePhone maybe a year or two

35:44.460 --> 35:45.500
down the line.

35:45.500 --> 35:48.860
Well, thank you very much for coming on the show, Lucas.

35:48.860 --> 35:52.660
And you'll have to come in and update us as things progress.

35:52.660 --> 35:55.180
If people want to find out more about what you're up to,

35:55.180 --> 35:56.460
where's the best place?

35:56.460 --> 36:01.700
So we do run a monthly blog on pine64.org.

36:01.700 --> 36:08.380
And we also have a Twitter and Masternode account

36:08.380 --> 36:10.500
at the pine64.

36:10.500 --> 36:13.940
So you can find out what we're up to on there.

36:13.940 --> 36:14.420
Great.

36:14.420 --> 36:16.140
Well, we'll put some links in the show notes.

36:16.140 --> 36:17.380
Thanks a lot for joining us.

36:17.380 --> 36:18.700
Thank you so much.

36:18.700 --> 36:20.420
You can tell it's an ambitious project.

36:20.420 --> 36:21.980
But they're matching that ambition

36:21.980 --> 36:24.500
with a genuine level of transparency.

36:24.500 --> 36:26.580
You really know what you're going to get, right?

36:26.580 --> 36:28.860
At the start of the show, we talked a little bit

36:28.860 --> 36:30.180
about the PinePhone.

36:30.180 --> 36:32.300
And they're very clear even there that, hey,

36:32.300 --> 36:34.140
this is an early issue of the device.

36:34.140 --> 36:35.860
And that's true for all their devices.

36:35.860 --> 36:38.180
So you're not going to have bad expectations.

36:38.180 --> 36:42.180
So Cheesy, you've talked a lot about the pros of the PineBook

36:42.180 --> 36:44.500
Pro.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.580
Is there some cons to using this device?

36:46.580 --> 36:47.940
There must be some drawbacks.

36:47.940 --> 36:51.180
There must have been a moment you were missing your main rig.

36:51.180 --> 36:53.500
Yeah, I mean, there are a few drawbacks, right?

36:53.500 --> 36:56.100
Like, no piece of hardware is perfect.

36:56.100 --> 37:00.460
Or I've not found a piece of hardware that's flawless.

37:00.460 --> 37:03.740
So like we mentioned in the interview,

37:03.740 --> 37:07.340
the trackpad does have some issues with palm rejection,

37:07.340 --> 37:09.460
which can be extremely frustrating when you're

37:09.460 --> 37:11.140
using it.

37:11.140 --> 37:13.540
So what I've found is that I turn it off

37:13.540 --> 37:16.180
with the hardware key.

37:16.180 --> 37:18.460
And then once turned off, I just use a USB mouse.

37:18.460 --> 37:21.060
And it works great that way.

37:21.060 --> 37:25.100
They are working on some firmware patches for that.

37:25.100 --> 37:29.380
In fact, they already have a patch that's out.

37:29.380 --> 37:31.600
And it's currently being worked on.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.660
So your mileage may vary.

37:33.660 --> 37:35.260
They've been working on it really hard.

37:35.260 --> 37:36.760
I think there's a team of eight people

37:36.760 --> 37:38.700
working on getting it patched.

37:38.700 --> 37:44.220
And that will be essentially a SPI flash to the keyboard.

37:44.220 --> 37:45.940
And you'll have to reboot the machine.

37:45.940 --> 37:47.440
And then once you reboot the machine,

37:47.440 --> 37:50.180
the trackpad should be operable, and everything

37:50.180 --> 37:50.940
should be better.

37:50.940 --> 37:51.700
That's nice.

37:51.700 --> 37:52.620
So I've yet to try it.

37:52.620 --> 37:54.980
But after the show today, I'm sure I'll jump in there

37:54.980 --> 37:58.220
and chat with Lucas and give it a go myself.

37:58.220 --> 38:00.420
It ships with Debian 9.

38:00.420 --> 38:01.580
So you've got an older kernel.

38:01.580 --> 38:04.100
You've got the 4.4 kernel.

38:04.100 --> 38:08.180
And along with that, you've got Debian, which I love Debian.

38:08.180 --> 38:10.140
In our previous episode, I talked

38:10.140 --> 38:12.880
about how much I love Debian and all of its variations

38:12.880 --> 38:15.140
and spins and everything.

38:15.140 --> 38:21.140
But you don't really have a huge repository of software,

38:21.140 --> 38:25.900
especially compiled for the Arch 64 ARM platform.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.300
Or I suppose another way to put that

38:27.300 --> 38:30.900
is you don't have a huge selection of desktop software

38:30.900 --> 38:31.740
that you need.

38:31.740 --> 38:32.580
Right.

38:32.580 --> 38:34.820
Because it probably has plenty of server side packages,

38:34.820 --> 38:35.820
very large repos.

38:35.820 --> 38:36.320
Absolutely.

38:36.320 --> 38:39.900
But let's say you want Telegram or Quossel

38:39.900 --> 38:41.100
or something like that.

38:41.100 --> 38:42.980
You're probably not going to find it there.

38:42.980 --> 38:43.860
I do want those things.

38:43.860 --> 38:44.360
Exactly.

38:44.360 --> 38:44.860
I do.

38:44.860 --> 38:45.460
Exactly.

38:45.460 --> 38:46.980
But one way to kind of extend that,

38:46.980 --> 38:50.300
and you can extend that on the default Debian 9 build,

38:50.300 --> 38:53.140
or there's some Ubuntu Mate builds and stuff like that

38:53.140 --> 38:54.340
for it out already.

38:54.340 --> 38:57.040
And to kind of get a little more extensibility

38:57.040 --> 38:59.920
from the software, you can install SnapD.

38:59.920 --> 39:03.960
So you can install Snap packages on the default Debian build

39:03.960 --> 39:06.460
or the Ubuntu builds to kind of get you

39:06.460 --> 39:08.780
over the hump with some of that stuff, say Telegram,

39:08.780 --> 39:10.180
for example.

39:10.180 --> 39:14.100
So you can extend it a few ways like that.

39:14.100 --> 39:16.980
The Manjaro build that we've talked about

39:16.980 --> 39:18.700
is one that's going to be, I think,

39:18.700 --> 39:21.700
fantastic because you're pretty much going to find everything

39:21.700 --> 39:22.380
you need there.

39:22.380 --> 39:24.380
It's going to be bleeding edge.

39:24.380 --> 39:28.100
I think a lot of people will gravitate toward Manjaro

39:28.100 --> 39:30.700
once they get everything dialed in.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.300
It's bright days for them there.

39:32.300 --> 39:32.860
Absolutely.

39:32.860 --> 39:37.260
Now, Cheese Wes and I have a Rock Pro 64

39:37.260 --> 39:39.620
here in the room, which is essentially

39:39.620 --> 39:42.260
what the Pine Book is built around, a slightly newer

39:42.260 --> 39:43.260
version.

39:43.260 --> 39:44.460
So I want to talk about this.

39:44.460 --> 39:46.880
In Mumble Room, if anybody has any questions about the Pine

39:46.880 --> 39:49.980
Book for Cheese, I'd like to give you a moment

39:49.980 --> 39:51.820
to get your questions right.

39:51.820 --> 39:53.300
Tag me in IRC.

39:53.300 --> 39:56.020
Just mum tag me while I tell everyone

39:56.020 --> 40:00.020
about Locka, which is our pick of the week, which I think

40:00.020 --> 40:01.700
will turn that, if you've managed

40:01.700 --> 40:04.540
to get yourself one of those Pine 64 boards like I have,

40:04.540 --> 40:07.820
this one was $60, doesn't come with a dang power adapter.

40:07.820 --> 40:09.320
I might note, just so you know, you'll

40:09.320 --> 40:10.540
need to get a power adapter.

40:10.540 --> 40:12.620
And it's a barrel plug.

40:12.620 --> 40:16.780
But once you get it set up, load Locka on this thing.

40:16.780 --> 40:18.860
They've talked about it on Choose Linux before,

40:18.860 --> 40:23.420
but it's a lightweight Linux distro from top to bottom

40:23.420 --> 40:27.860
that turns your Pine 64 into a retro gaming console.

40:27.860 --> 40:29.180
Yeah, it's like running RetroArch,

40:29.180 --> 40:31.500
but they've got images for all kinds

40:31.500 --> 40:33.380
of different single board computers out there.

40:33.380 --> 40:35.900
So whether you've got basically any version of the Raspberry

40:35.900 --> 40:38.980
Pi, or you've got one of these Rock Pros like we do,

40:38.980 --> 40:40.940
you can get this up and running.

40:40.940 --> 40:43.460
MiniMech, you had a question about the Pine Book.

40:43.460 --> 40:45.260
Yeah, yeah, I do, in fact.

40:45.260 --> 40:46.820
What about GPU performance?

40:46.820 --> 40:51.540
So, cheese, as I understand, you had ChromeMOS on it running.

40:51.540 --> 40:54.540
Did you run any Linux distribution on it?

40:54.540 --> 40:57.780
And how was the GPU performance when it comes to composites

40:57.780 --> 40:59.780
and video and something?

40:59.780 --> 41:03.460
Yeah, so I mean, it ships with the default Debian 9 build.

41:03.460 --> 41:06.500
I was able to play back 4K 60 frames a second

41:06.500 --> 41:10.180
on that Debian 9 build on YouTube.

41:10.180 --> 41:12.860
It was a little stuttery whenever

41:12.860 --> 41:14.220
I was streaming through YouTube.

41:14.220 --> 41:17.460
But whenever I pulled down Big Buck Bunny

41:17.460 --> 41:23.780
and ran it in a few variations, the 1080p, 60, 30 frames,

41:23.780 --> 41:25.860
and then the 4K 60 and 30 frames,

41:25.860 --> 41:27.540
there was a little stuttering there.

41:27.540 --> 41:29.540
But it wasn't, I felt that it was just.

41:29.540 --> 41:30.340
The gold standard.

41:30.340 --> 41:30.900
Yeah, exactly.

41:30.900 --> 41:31.620
I mean, it's not a test.

41:31.620 --> 41:32.900
He just really likes that one.

41:32.900 --> 41:34.460
Yeah, it's my jam, dude.

41:34.460 --> 41:36.660
Oh my god, I've seen that video so many damn times.

41:36.660 --> 41:37.540
I know, me too, me too.

41:37.540 --> 41:40.020
I'll note, though, the fact that it can play 4K content

41:40.020 --> 41:42.140
may be a bit irrelevant since the screen is 1080p.

41:42.140 --> 41:45.340
So if it can successfully play 1080p content,

41:45.340 --> 41:46.820
you're good to go.

41:46.820 --> 41:48.100
Can I ask a dumb question?

41:48.100 --> 41:49.100
Go ahead, go ahead.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.660
Does it charge over USB-C by chance,

41:51.660 --> 41:53.340
or is it a barrel connector?

41:53.340 --> 41:56.500
So it has a barrel connector and type C.

41:56.500 --> 42:00.580
You can charge over type C, and you

42:00.580 --> 42:04.700
can put display out through type C, which I've yet to try.

42:04.700 --> 42:07.700
I will say that using my, I think

42:07.700 --> 42:12.300
it's a 45-watt MacBook Pro charger, type C charger,

42:12.300 --> 42:14.420
doesn't work very well.

42:14.420 --> 42:16.060
It basically flickers back and forth.

42:16.060 --> 42:21.820
So I think it has to be 5 volts is the max.

42:21.820 --> 42:23.700
And don't quote me on that.

42:23.700 --> 42:26.460
That's how the Pine 64 board works is it's 5 volts.

42:26.460 --> 42:27.140
Right.

42:27.140 --> 42:30.500
But for an example, I have an anchor battery

42:30.500 --> 42:32.340
that I carry with me whenever I travel.

42:32.340 --> 42:36.420
And I was able to use that same type C cable

42:36.420 --> 42:37.940
that I was charging my phone with,

42:37.940 --> 42:39.460
plug it right into the Pinebook Pro

42:39.460 --> 42:40.300
while I was on the airplane.

42:40.300 --> 42:40.780
That's it.

42:40.780 --> 42:42.260
Just to get a little bit of juice.

42:42.260 --> 42:46.780
So I mean, I think it's like a 14-watt, 5 volts.

42:46.780 --> 42:50.460
So another one that worked was my Pixel 3a charger

42:50.460 --> 42:51.740
worked great with it.

42:51.740 --> 42:54.580
I note, too, that it has a 10,000 milliamp battery.

42:54.580 --> 42:57.120
So that gives the audience a little bit of perspective.

42:57.120 --> 43:00.100
One thing I'd like to know more about down the road

43:00.100 --> 43:04.300
is the PCIe 4x slot, which requires an adapter, they say.

43:04.300 --> 43:07.620
But you could use it to load an SSD in there

43:07.620 --> 43:08.420
or other things.

43:08.420 --> 43:10.100
That seems like it has some potential, too.

43:10.100 --> 43:10.620
Yeah.

43:10.620 --> 43:12.940
So they're working on the adapter.

43:12.940 --> 43:15.140
They had a little bit of an issue with it.

43:15.140 --> 43:18.140
And I think really what it came down to is the ribbon cable

43:18.140 --> 43:20.220
was a little too short.

43:20.220 --> 43:24.620
But you can buy an adapter, an NVMe PCIe adapter,

43:24.620 --> 43:28.260
for I think it's like $5 or something like that.

43:28.260 --> 43:30.060
And then you can hook up an NVMe drive to it.

43:30.060 --> 43:33.100
I know that some of the NVMe drives

43:33.100 --> 43:35.860
are a little different in their height, which

43:35.860 --> 43:39.900
can cause the trackpad to kind of shift and stuff.

43:39.900 --> 43:43.200
But I think, like I said, they're redesigning that adapter.

43:43.200 --> 43:45.700
And I believe that they're going to bring that profile down

43:45.700 --> 43:46.200
a little bit.

43:46.200 --> 43:47.700
So you shouldn't have any problems.

43:47.700 --> 43:50.380
Now, do note that if you do add an NVMe drive,

43:50.380 --> 43:51.940
depending on the drive, and you need

43:51.940 --> 43:54.100
to double check this if you're going to do this,

43:54.100 --> 43:57.540
depending on the drive, you could get a significant more

43:57.540 --> 43:58.180
power draw.

43:58.180 --> 44:00.340
So you could reduce your battery life.

44:00.340 --> 44:02.580
So there's kind of a trade-off there

44:02.580 --> 44:04.580
on what you're wanting to do with it.

44:04.580 --> 44:07.300
The age-old thing, performance versus battery life, GV.

44:07.300 --> 44:07.820
Exactly.

44:07.820 --> 44:08.900
Well, keep using it.

44:08.900 --> 44:10.860
Now, not only are you our Denver correspondent,

44:10.860 --> 44:14.220
but you're our Pinebook Pro correspondent now.

44:14.220 --> 44:17.260
Also, again, thank you to Lucas for taking time

44:17.260 --> 44:19.220
to join us on the show today.

44:19.220 --> 44:21.960
We'll have links to the Pinebook Pro in the show notes

44:21.960 --> 44:23.300
if you're interested.

44:23.300 --> 44:27.260
And I was researching up, just familiarizing myself again,

44:27.260 --> 44:29.180
with Pine64.

44:29.180 --> 44:33.460
I didn't realize one of their co-founders created the Popcorn

44:33.460 --> 44:34.820
Hour media player.

44:34.820 --> 44:35.460
Really?

44:35.460 --> 44:38.060
Which, for people that have been around for a very, very long

44:38.060 --> 44:40.060
time, I used to talk about quite a bit on last.

44:40.060 --> 44:42.060
It used to be like my go-to media solution

44:42.060 --> 44:43.980
before the days of Ambient Plex.

44:43.980 --> 44:49.420
And really, Cody, I was really impressed by that.

44:49.420 --> 44:50.660
That's a good lineage.

44:50.660 --> 44:52.020
Really love that device.

44:52.020 --> 44:54.900
Another device that they created,

44:54.900 --> 44:56.740
and I believe they're still selling,

44:56.740 --> 45:00.740
is the Rochambeau retro console, which is, I don't think,

45:00.740 --> 45:02.500
super huge here in the States, but it's

45:02.500 --> 45:03.980
pretty big over in Asia.

45:03.980 --> 45:04.820
Looks really cool.

45:04.820 --> 45:07.420
Yeah, that does look like a neat device.

45:07.420 --> 45:09.840
All right, well, let's wrap it up there.

45:09.840 --> 45:11.380
We have something in the post-show

45:11.380 --> 45:12.100
that I want to get to.

45:12.100 --> 45:13.060
I know that's a weird thing to say

45:13.060 --> 45:14.100
that I want to get to the post-show,

45:14.100 --> 45:15.500
but I got something special.

45:15.500 --> 45:17.780
Go get more Westpane along with Jim Salter

45:17.780 --> 45:20.060
over at TechSnap.Systems.

45:20.060 --> 45:21.780
Great episodes these days.

45:21.780 --> 45:25.460
You guys are hitting your stride, and it really shows.

45:25.460 --> 45:27.820
I was really enjoying Jim's thoughts on Microsoft, too,

45:27.820 --> 45:29.420
after going to Insight recently.

45:29.420 --> 45:32.460
So check out TechSnap.Systems for that.

45:32.460 --> 45:34.900
Also, Cheesy goes on a little bit more

45:34.900 --> 45:37.140
and gets nerdy about single-board computers

45:37.140 --> 45:38.860
on a recent episode of Choose Linux.

45:38.860 --> 45:39.860
Oh, that's a great one.

45:39.860 --> 45:42.380
ChooseLinux.Show for that.

45:42.380 --> 45:46.140
And of course, the one, the only Brent with brunch

45:46.140 --> 45:47.940
over at extras.show.

45:47.940 --> 45:50.180
If you dig around, you go to the tag,

45:50.180 --> 45:52.500
you may just find an RSS feed, and you

45:52.500 --> 45:54.540
can get just the brunches, if you like.

45:54.540 --> 45:56.340
It may be possible.

45:56.340 --> 45:58.340
That's an exercise for the listener, though.

45:58.340 --> 46:01.660
I'm not saying it's possible, but I am just hashtag saying.

46:01.660 --> 46:02.660
You know what I'm saying?

46:02.660 --> 46:04.700
Oh, yeah.

46:04.700 --> 46:06.140
I'm at ChrisLAS.

46:06.140 --> 46:07.980
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

46:07.980 --> 46:09.620
The show is at Linux Unplugged.

46:09.620 --> 46:12.260
And just one last reminder, we'd love

46:12.260 --> 46:14.500
to start incorporating some of your feedback and follow-up

46:14.500 --> 46:17.980
as the year wraps up, linuxunplugged.com

46:17.980 --> 46:21.180
slash contact, and that new time, noon Pacific.

46:21.180 --> 46:22.820
See you back here next Tuesday.

46:22.820 --> 46:24.820
Bye-bye.

46:52.820 --> 46:59.740
All right, we've got to go pick our titles.

46:59.740 --> 47:02.060
JBtitles.com, if you're watching the live stream,

47:02.060 --> 47:03.140
it is your duty.

47:03.140 --> 47:04.660
Before you go check, maybe just go

47:04.660 --> 47:07.660
throw four or 10 title suggestions in there.

47:07.660 --> 47:09.380
You know, just do your duty.

47:09.380 --> 47:10.180
Is the noon crowd?

47:10.180 --> 47:11.660
Well, I mean, we have 14.

47:11.660 --> 47:12.540
We've got 14 titles.

47:12.540 --> 47:13.300
They're new, Wes.

47:13.300 --> 47:13.780
I know.

47:13.780 --> 47:16.020
And we didn't really recap the whole titles, though.

47:16.020 --> 47:17.140
It's a complicated notion.

47:17.140 --> 47:18.100
So you still have time.

47:18.100 --> 47:20.220
Bang suggests a great title, and then we

47:20.220 --> 47:21.900
will go vote here in a moment.

47:21.900 --> 47:25.060
In the meantime, though, guess what, Wes?

47:25.060 --> 47:25.580
What?

47:25.580 --> 47:27.100
Little surprise for you.

47:27.100 --> 47:30.820
There was some extra discussion between Joe Cheese and Lucas

47:30.820 --> 47:33.980
about future products they're working on, like the time.

47:33.980 --> 47:35.260
Oh, the PineTime.

47:35.260 --> 47:38.620
And I thought maybe we'd include that here in the post-show.

47:38.620 --> 47:41.300
So you've teased a few other devices.

47:41.300 --> 47:42.860
Let's briefly touch on those.

47:42.860 --> 47:45.180
I'm aware of the watch and the tablet,

47:45.180 --> 47:48.640
and even possibly a router, as Americans would say.

47:48.640 --> 47:50.820
So what's going on with those three?

47:50.820 --> 47:54.140
So the development kit for the PineTime,

47:54.140 --> 47:56.660
so that's the smartwatch, have gone out.

47:56.660 --> 47:59.620
And there is an extraordinary amount

47:59.620 --> 48:03.220
of work happening within this sub-community.

48:03.220 --> 48:04.780
I'm absolutely blown away.

48:04.780 --> 48:06.300
I mean, I've already seen pictures

48:06.300 --> 48:11.620
of watch faces, and all sorts of different operating system

48:11.620 --> 48:13.380
pop up on Twitter.

48:13.380 --> 48:16.300
So there's clearly a lot of interest in this.

48:16.300 --> 48:20.540
And we have been contacted by both educators

48:20.540 --> 48:23.220
and people who just like to tinker

48:23.220 --> 48:27.700
with these low-powered arm devices.

48:27.700 --> 48:30.540
And we've recently reached the decision

48:30.540 --> 48:33.820
that this is just one of those things

48:33.820 --> 48:36.220
that we probably want to have in the store

48:36.220 --> 48:39.180
so that anybody who wants to have a go at it

48:39.180 --> 48:40.900
can have a go at it.

48:40.900 --> 48:43.220
So that's the PineTime.

48:43.220 --> 48:45.740
In respect to the PineTab, which is the tablet which

48:45.740 --> 48:49.080
we're doing, it is taking a bit of a backseat right now.

48:49.080 --> 48:54.380
Getting the PineBook Pros shipping and Pine phones

48:54.380 --> 48:59.860
into production has proven to be a lot of work.

48:59.860 --> 49:03.740
So we had to put one project to the side for now.

49:03.740 --> 49:07.660
But there's a lot of interest in the PineTab.

49:07.660 --> 49:10.100
We get asked about it constantly.

49:10.100 --> 49:12.900
So we recently made the decision that we're

49:12.900 --> 49:14.500
going to start a very small production

49:14.500 --> 49:17.900
batch for people who are very interested in this.

49:17.900 --> 49:21.420
This will be akin to the Braveheart edition

49:21.420 --> 49:24.380
for the PinePhone.

49:24.380 --> 49:27.740
So only for enthusiasts, in other words.

49:27.740 --> 49:31.620
We haven't decided on when it will be available.

49:31.620 --> 49:36.820
Definitely next year in 2020, sometime in Q1.

49:36.820 --> 49:39.940
But we're still waiting for one of the partner projects

49:39.940 --> 49:42.920
to deliver an operating system that would

49:42.920 --> 49:44.700
be viable for the tablet.

49:44.700 --> 49:45.980
And the router, then?

49:45.980 --> 49:49.220
The router is something that I guess

49:49.220 --> 49:52.540
I can talk about it broadly.

49:52.540 --> 49:56.440
I really wanted to do a router for quite some time.

49:56.440 --> 49:58.700
I actually pitched this as an idea sometime back.

49:58.700 --> 50:03.020
But then everything else took precedence.

50:03.020 --> 50:07.260
And then completely coincidentally, somebody

50:07.260 --> 50:10.300
posted a question on Reddit.

50:10.300 --> 50:14.180
Would it be possible for Pine64 to make a router?

50:14.180 --> 50:16.860
And this gained a lot of traction.

50:16.860 --> 50:18.220
And so I responded.

50:18.220 --> 50:21.740
And I was clear saying that it's probably not going to happen.

50:21.740 --> 50:23.980
But if we were to do it, what sort of stuff

50:23.980 --> 50:26.220
would you want to see in it?

50:26.220 --> 50:31.340
And I've spoken to both a hardware networking

50:31.340 --> 50:35.980
engineer and a software networking engineer.

50:35.980 --> 50:38.840
And at this point in time, it appears to me

50:38.840 --> 50:42.940
that we do not have the right SOC for the job.

50:42.940 --> 50:47.340
It would just be, it wouldn't be the best router that can be.

50:47.340 --> 50:50.860
I actually was even contacted, and a huge shout out here

50:50.860 --> 50:54.940
to PFSense, who have been so lovely.

50:54.940 --> 50:57.740
They contacted me and said, do you want to talk?

50:57.740 --> 50:58.380
And we talked.

50:58.380 --> 51:00.380
And they were just really good.

51:00.380 --> 51:03.820
And the audience, a real gentleman,

51:03.820 --> 51:06.060
just having a chat with me and trying

51:06.060 --> 51:09.740
to figure out if we could possibly take a stab at it.

51:09.740 --> 51:13.180
But as of today, the decision is no, we just

51:13.180 --> 51:15.180
don't have the right SOC for networking.

51:15.180 --> 51:17.300
And it would be silly of us to try

51:17.300 --> 51:21.020
to compete with the existing propositions, which

51:21.020 --> 51:22.500
are simply much better.

51:22.500 --> 51:24.260
I love that realism.

51:24.260 --> 51:25.940
It's like, it'd be nice to do.

51:25.940 --> 51:27.340
We don't have the tech right now.

51:27.340 --> 51:28.340
Yeah.

51:28.340 --> 51:30.860
It's not a big flashy show.

51:30.860 --> 51:31.740
It's not NeoApple.

51:31.740 --> 51:32.540
It's just.

51:32.540 --> 51:33.900
Well, and I think that that's one

51:33.900 --> 51:36.900
of the things that's really cool about the Pine64 crew

51:36.900 --> 51:39.580
is that they're interested in providing

51:39.580 --> 51:43.740
the best product they can based around the ARM platform.

51:43.740 --> 51:47.580
And so if it's not going to work and the hardware isn't there

51:47.580 --> 51:50.340
yet, then they're not going to put out something that's subpar.

51:50.340 --> 51:52.420
Because quite honestly, they know

51:52.420 --> 51:54.700
that we'll all tear it apart.

51:54.700 --> 51:57.180
It's perfect for a guy like me who

51:57.180 --> 51:59.420
I am perfectly happy to sit back and watch

51:59.420 --> 52:01.640
ARM devices get better and more sophisticated and more

52:01.640 --> 52:02.140
capable.

52:02.140 --> 52:03.760
I don't really have any skin in the game

52:03.760 --> 52:06.500
because I'm pretty happy with my x86 laptops.

52:06.500 --> 52:07.500
But I could see where.

52:07.500 --> 52:08.580
But all your Intel stock.

52:08.580 --> 52:11.340
Yeah, well, I can see where this.

52:11.340 --> 52:12.540
I wish.

52:12.540 --> 52:14.460
Maybe not, actually.

52:14.460 --> 52:16.580
I could see where this trend line's going, though.

52:16.580 --> 52:18.300
I can see where this trend line's going.

52:18.300 --> 52:22.660
And I'm like, I'm really glad folks like Pine are doing this.

52:22.660 --> 52:24.780
Another one I'd love to see, just keeping

52:24.780 --> 52:26.860
it on theme for this episode.

52:26.860 --> 52:30.260
Man, I'd freaking love to see an ARM laptop like the Pine

52:30.260 --> 52:31.980
Book Pro from System76.

52:31.980 --> 52:32.860
That would be neat.

52:32.860 --> 52:33.740
Absolutely.

52:33.740 --> 52:35.620
That's got to be in the back burner up there.

52:35.620 --> 52:38.340
They've got to be tinkering with that in their R&D area.

52:38.340 --> 52:39.260
Pop Book Pro?

52:39.260 --> 52:41.980
Well, it's something that I've, it's

52:41.980 --> 52:45.740
something I might have mentioned to you at the roundtable.

52:45.740 --> 52:48.020
But did you call it a Pop Book Pro, cheese?

52:48.020 --> 52:48.580
Because that's.

52:48.580 --> 52:49.100
I didn't.

52:49.100 --> 52:49.780
But I should have.

52:49.780 --> 53:08.880
So please check it out.
