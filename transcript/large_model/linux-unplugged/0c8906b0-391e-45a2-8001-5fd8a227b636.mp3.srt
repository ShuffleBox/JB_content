1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
Ready when Brent is.

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,440
How you doing over there, Brent?

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,720
Tracking down a power cord?

4
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,520
What are you doing?

5
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,040
Yeah, it's actually a desk vibration issue.

6
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,120
I think I've figured it out.

7
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,040
What do you think?

8
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,840
I think it does sound better.

9
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,800
I don't know how you have desk vibration issues.

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,320
Amazing.

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,820
You know, I don't mean these things,

12
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,200
but sometimes they just happen.

13
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:33,360
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,160
My name is Chris.

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,200
My name is Wes.

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,080
My name is Brent.

17
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,680
And my name is Alex.

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,120
Hello, gentlemen.

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,240
Thank you all for joining me here in our giant Linux

20
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,240
assembly.

21
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,840
As we have quite the show this week,

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,920
we're looking at two new options that

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,640
enable anyone to run a personal server at home.

24
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,520
I'm talking easily, safely, self-host this sucker yourself,

25
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,760
and run some of your favorite open-source apps

26
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,640
like Nextcloud, maybe a matrix server, anything you want.

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,280
Take control of your data after today's episode.

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,200
And then we're going to round it out

29
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,280
with some great emails, boosts, picks, and more.

30
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,300
We have quite the show.

31
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,540
Very excited about it today.

32
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,760
So before we go any further, let's

33
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,760
say time-appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,000
Hello, Mumble Room.

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,500
Hello.

36
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Hello.

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hello, Chris.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,840
Wes, Brent, and everyone.

39
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,600
And also, Alex, thanks for joining us.

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,400
It's been a bit since we had you on the show.

41
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,920
But today's episode kind of seemed

42
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,280
like it was in your sweet spot.

43
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,960
I like what you've done with the drapes.

44
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,560
Yeah.

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,720
That was Wes's idea.

46
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,040
You know, I didn't think unicorns

47
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,960
would match the decor.

48
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,240
But if you get the right unicorns, it works.

49
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,080
I think the googly eyes go a long way.

50
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,960
Yes.

51
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,880
It's just they all look like they're looking at me.

52
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,640
Well, one of the other reasons Alex is here

53
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,320
besides the topic, which is right down his alley,

54
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,840
because he is our host of Self-Hosted,

55
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,520
is we are also announcing, very excited about this,

56
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,600
a Jupiter broadcasting East Coast meetup.

57
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,200
It has been a long time coming.

58
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,040
We have not made it out to the East Coast

59
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,760
since Ohio Linux Fest about 100 years ago.

60
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,560
So on April 9, a Saturday, we're going

61
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,980
to be in Raleigh, North Carolina.

62
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,840
And Alex, I think you have maybe found the ultimate meetup

63
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,720
location.

64
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,200
I think this could be one of our best spots ever.

65
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,080
I hope so, yeah.

66
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,740
So I've been racking my brains for a COVID-safe location,

67
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,120
which primarily means somewhere outside.

68
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,460
And you want somewhere with good food and good drink.

69
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,360
So we're going to go to a place called Prime Barbecue, which

70
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,600
is a Texas-style barbecue joint.

71
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,560
And then just across the park from this place,

72
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,200
it's a place called Oak City Brewing, a local brewery.

73
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,080
That's so great.

74
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,240
You got a park with barbecue on one side

75
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,640
and a brewery on the other side.

76
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,040
I'm salivating already.

77
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,800
North Carolina, Raleigh, North Carolina

78
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,320
is going to be beautiful in early April, right?

79
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,960
Like, Wes, you got to go.

80
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,360
I mean, you just got to go, Wes.

81
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,240
We're going to talk Brent into it, too.

82
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,840
I think I have to go.

83
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,400
I'm in.

84
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,560
I love it.

85
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,800
All right, cool.

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,360
So I have a link to the meetup in the show notes,

87
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,760
or you can find it by going to meetup.com slash Jupiter

88
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,960
broadcasting.

89
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,280
We don't make it out to the East Coast very often.

90
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,640
I'm hoping to bring the wife and maybe the boy with me,

91
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
because it's going to be right around his birthday

92
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,360
and spring break.

93
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
So I'm not sure exactly.

94
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,920
But I think we're flying.

95
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,520
As much as it would feed my soul to take Joups out there

96
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,680
on a road trip, because I've always wanted a road trip

97
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,120
to see Alex, I just don't think we could get the cost figured

98
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,720
out, because it's going to be four or five grand in gas

99
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,480
alone, plus wear and tear on the vehicle, plus camping.

100
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,360
So then it's looking like a seven grand trip to take Joups,

101
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,040
versus a two or three grand trip if we fly.

102
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,060
And even that's kind of expensive, so it is what it is.

103
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,520
I'd love to do the whole thing, where

104
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
we do the trip and shows on the whole road.

105
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,280
But I think for this one, we're just

106
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,360
going to do the surgical strike, because it's

107
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
the most economical.

108
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,240
Look at you being practical.

109
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,900
I mean, it would make me a little worried,

110
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,280
considering how you got stuck in Tucson last time.

111
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,820
There's a lot of places to get stuck across the whole country.

112
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,320
It's true.

113
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,460
However, much better time of the year

114
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,520
to travel, especially once you make it down south.

115
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,720
April is not nearly as hot as August.

116
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,920
That was brutal.

117
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,040
But I'm very excited either way.

118
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,560
It's really long overdue.

119
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,940
Couple of small details.

120
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,100
We're thinking of meeting around about 3 PM, so mid-afternoon.

121
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,540
The barbecue place closes about 5,

122
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,320
and then we'll head on over to the brewery afterwards.

123
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,280
Those are good details.

124
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,180
Thanks for adding that.

125
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,480
There was something else, but I've forgotten what it is.

126
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,960
Well, the meetup page is super early.

127
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,000
It's just really rough.

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,300
But I could add you as a organizer, Alex,

129
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,800
and then you could add the details

130
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,960
as you think of them and stuff.

131
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,820
Yeah, that sounds good.

132
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,520
We'll probably want to do some updates and stuff.

133
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,640
Let's do that, yeah.

134
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,120
Do you think Jose might show up?

135
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh, that's always going to be the question now, isn't it?

136
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,960
All right, Jose.

137
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,920
Gauntlet's been thrown.

138
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,680
We shall see.

139
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,440
OK, well, Alex, while you're here,

140
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,680
I wanted to pick up on something that you and I touched

141
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,440
on in Self-Hosted 65 last week.

142
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,400
And that is the release of True Naz Scale.

143
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,840
This is a big release, because iXsystems

144
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,200
has been working on this since the summer of 2020.

145
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,960
And this, unlike previous Free Naz and True Naz products,

146
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
this one's based on Debian.

147
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,920
It's based on Debian 11, which enabled

148
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,480
them to do a whole bunch of extra stuff,

149
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,360
like properly support Docker, use KVM for the back end

150
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,060
virtualization.

151
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,560
And to manage all of it underneath the GUI,

152
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,040
to manage those containers and those VMs,

153
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,240
they're using HelmScript, which is, what's an easy way to say

154
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,080
that, say, composable Kubernetes?

155
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,480
How would you describe HelmScript?

156
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,400
Yeah, Helm is like compose for Kubernetes.

157
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,440
That's what I would say.

158
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,480
And so you could see how, if you have

159
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,640
a whole system that's being orchestrated by Kubernetes,

160
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,640
it does kind of lend itself to scaling out, hence the name.

161
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,360
But you went hands-on with it, Alex,

162
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,920
and you go into detail in Self-Hosted.

163
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,160
But I just kind of wanted to get your impressions

164
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,080
as a potential platform for people

165
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,040
to use this to run applications at home like Next Cloud,

166
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,520
maybe to back up their systems, like their desktops

167
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,640
and their laptops and other servers they might have.

168
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,080
What are your opinions for that kind of use case?

169
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,520
Well, we talked about it in episode 65, as you say,

170
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,560
of Self-Hosted.

171
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,440
And my impressions, unfortunately,

172
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,040
were kind of colored by the fact that I

173
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,840
was unable to even do a basic thing like import

174
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,240
my existing ZFS pool.

175
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,800
And without storage, you can't really do very much in TrueNAS,

176
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,720
as it turns out.

177
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,520
So I'm going to have to revisit it in a few months

178
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,280
and actually wait until they've worked out

179
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,240
some of the release kinks.

180
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,840
But since airing that episode on Friday,

181
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,000
we've had a few folks write into the Self-Hosted mailbox

182
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
telling me, because I was struggling

183
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,160
to think of a use case for TrueNAS,

184
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,120
really, in a world of un-raids and kind of just normal Linux

185
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,680
with ZFS on Linux kind of layered on top.

186
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,760
Turns out lots of people use it for things like dentists

187
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,920
and doctor's offices, that kind of thing,

188
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,800
small to medium business deployments, that sort of thing.

189
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,640
So there is definitely a market out there

190
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,680
for something like TrueNAS.

191
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,560
Laurence Systems, Tom from Laurence Systems,

192
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,500
has done some good content on it this week.

193
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,320
I think the Craft Computing dude has done some stuff as well.

194
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,600
And served the home as well.

195
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,880
But I'm pretty excited about what this means, really,

196
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,080
for the future of ZFS on Linux as a project,

197
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,680
like having TrueNAS scale and, in particular,

198
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,480
a Linux-based version of, air quotes, the product formerly

199
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,120
known as FreeNAS, is really exciting.

200
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,760
It's almost as exciting as the Steam Deck on the desktop.

201
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,080
Like, it's a proper legitimization

202
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,760
of that technology stack.

203
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,160
I know Chris and I have chatted about this for a bit.

204
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,920
But what does the switch of base system actually mean for you?

205
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,960
As an admin, especially if maybe folks

206
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,720
are used to just using the UI, what

207
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,040
does the base platform matter?

208
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,480
Well, it matters less than it did, thanks to containers.

209
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,560
But every time I log into my OpenSense box,

210
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,040
and I think, oh, it would be cool if I could just

211
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,040
apt-get this package, or whatever it is.

212
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,720
I'm totally fluent and familiar with all of the Linux tooling.

213
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,400
But even just something as simple on BSD

214
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,280
as doing a netstat, for example, to list all the listening

215
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,360
ports for a particular service.

216
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,400
The flags I use for netstat have to be different in BSD

217
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,360
than they do to Linux.

218
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,240
It's just, I guess, a muscle memory thing at this point.

219
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,680
Like, I use Linux all day, every day.

220
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,180
And I don't want to have to remember

221
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,800
that for this particular box, I have to context switch

222
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,520
to the BSD version of stuff.

223
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,400
Right, you're simply back to ifconfig.

224
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,120
It's death by 1,000 little paper cuts for me, BSD.

225
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,800
And maybe those hurt a little bit extra

226
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,600
when you're kind of in crisis mode.

227
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,400
And that can happen when it's your NAS.

228
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,120
Which is normally when you're looking at that kind of thing,

229
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,440
yeah, exactly.

230
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,520
Yeah.

231
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,000
I'll tell you what I find interesting about it.

232
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,600
And you just touched on it, Alex.

233
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,720
So for TrueNAS Scale, and of course they still

234
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,520
have the regular TrueNAS products that are BSD based,

235
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,800
but with TrueNAS Scale, it's exactly that use case.

236
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,680
What I did for the very last kind of two years of my IT

237
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,440
contracting where I became an independent contractor,

238
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,360
my ninja move was a Linux box that was pretty powerful

239
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,800
that ran KVM.

240
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,400
And then Microsoft, they probably still make it,

241
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,080
but back then they made this tool

242
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,920
that you could install on a Windows server

243
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,000
and it would convert a live Windows server into a VHD file.

244
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,160
And I could then move that to my Linux box.

245
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,880
And so what I would do for these folks

246
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,000
is I would help virtualize their legacy infrastructure

247
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,720
from their failing hardware.

248
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,120
I would use Samba on the host to actually provide

249
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,480
a lot of the essential network services.

250
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,560
Because often they were like older Windows boxes,

251
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,320
NT4 or something like that.

252
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,280
Or just another thing that was kind of common

253
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,920
is people would just use Windows XP

254
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,480
and just set up file sharing on it for like a doctor's office

255
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,040
or a dentist's office.

256
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,520
I actually, this exact scenario happened at a dentist's office.

257
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,040
They use a Windows XP workstation

258
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,680
because they needed access to a scanner as well.

259
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,960
And I ultimately moved that all over to a Linux box

260
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,920
and then we just kept the XP workstation just

261
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,080
to do the scanning and save it to the Samba share.

262
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,080
And what TrueNAS Scale has done here

263
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,640
is they've really built this thing

264
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,680
to be super user-friendly for Windows right out of the box.

265
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,480
It supports all of the fancy kind of Windows Samba share

266
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,600
features that you need to just kind of look totally

267
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,920
like a Windows file server to the clients.

268
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,160
And that to me is like, that's great

269
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,160
because anytime I'm setting something up,

270
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,320
that's definitely part of the setup.

271
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,880
And to have IX systems just kind of build

272
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,640
those kinds of things in in a prescribed way

273
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,480
where it's already on and it's on in the right way

274
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,200
because this is what they do.

275
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,240
And they give me a UI that I could actually

276
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,760
hand off to like the tech person, quote unquote,

277
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,200
at that office.

278
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,280
Or in the case of this dentist's office,

279
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,840
he wanted to have the login.

280
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,120
He wanted all the passwords.

281
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,480
And this is something he could actually go check to see

282
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,280
how much free space he has.

283
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,040
And so this is exactly the kind of thing

284
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,840
I would deploy for that dentist's office, no doubt

285
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,680
about it.

286
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,200
What they ended up getting from me

287
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,760
were just Linux boxes that just would

288
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,760
have some form of some whatever web admin

289
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,120
UI was in style back then.

290
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,480
Well, I'd be curious to know what

291
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,920
has changed from then till now.

292
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,640
It sounds to me like abstraction is

293
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,080
the whole kind of beauty of where we've come now.

294
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,680
It's like you just kind of hit a few buttons

295
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,760
and it's all there for you.

296
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,680
I would imagine, Chris, back then it was quite a bit of work

297
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,520
to set all this up.

298
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,320
But do you think now it would be like maybe, I don't know,

299
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,400
a few minutes for you?

300
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,960
The big advantage here now with their support of Docker

301
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,580
containers is a lot of the applications

302
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,720
you'd be deploying on a local network for a small office

303
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,040
or any small business, a lot of that's

304
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,860
going to be via a Docker container or a VM.

305
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,480
And they make that really easy now because they support KVM

306
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,800
and Docker.

307
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,960
It's still early.

308
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,080
Like Alex said, he ran into issues.

309
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,760
If he was creating a new storage pool,

310
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,200
it probably wouldn't have had any problems.

311
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,620
But Alex, because you're trying to import your old storage

312
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,760
pool, you ran into some kind of bug.

313
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,480
I bet you if you checked back in six, seven months,

314
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,080
downloaded the latest ISO, I bet you

315
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,880
you wouldn't even have that problem anymore.

316
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,840
They're just kind of early still,

317
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,360
even though they've been working on this for a while.

318
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,840
It may well do that.

319
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,600
There were a couple of other teething issues

320
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,160
which we covered in the episode as well.

321
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,520
But I look at the other thing that they're doing there,

322
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,800
including Gluster out of the box as their primary scaling

323
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
storage method.

324
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,760
Scaling out ZFS, yeah.

325
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,420
Yeah, it's a really interesting play, that.

326
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,560
Because then you end up treating individual servers

327
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,280
like they become cattle instead of pets.

328
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,840
And you can lose any of those servers

329
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,240
and still maintain your data.

330
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,200
So there's some really interesting stuff

331
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,960
that they're bringing to the masses

332
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,720
almost with this release.

333
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,080
I have to say that Gluster aspect of it kind of for just

334
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,700
a second made me go, maybe this is what we should be doing.

335
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,740
Because we've kind of had a pause with our local server

336
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,760
rollout.

337
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,060
And what we've been thinking is maybe instead

338
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,060
of YOLOing the storage like we were originally going to do

339
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,800
and just like.

340
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,960
Definitely, definitely.

341
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,560
Just YOLO it for sure.

342
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,600
Not enough VDEVs, crazy configurations

343
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,840
with not enough redundancy.

344
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,360
And then like, let's grab some fiber channel,

345
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,740
connect these things together, and just run

346
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,360
disks across all of these.

347
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,960
Now I'm looking at it going, well,

348
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,280
what if we did the opposite thing

349
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,920
and we actually built for reliability?

350
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,400
So like, what if we wanted to host more things here?

351
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,680
And how would I build the infrastructure in that case?

352
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,280
And there was a few minutes where

353
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,640
I'm looking at that Freenet scale and I'm going,

354
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,360
you know, this would solve some of our problems.

355
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,040
Like, I could immediately see how it would work for us.

356
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,880
You know you did that in self-hosted as well.

357
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,240
You called it Freenet scale.

358
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,200
And I let it go then.

359
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,700
Oh, yeah.

360
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,600
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

361
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,120
TrueNAS scale.

362
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,080
I just thought that was funny.

363
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,400
Yeah, you know, it's hard for me.

364
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,020
Because it's been Freenet my whole life.

365
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,320
You know, this TrueNAS stuff, that feels new, Alex.

366
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,520
But if you're going to build a system like that at JB,

367
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,600
let's say you've got two or three different systems.

368
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,520
Are they all in the same building?

369
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,280
Or is there an internet connection involved

370
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,160
between them offsite?

371
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,160
Well, in my new head paradigm, they're in the same building.

372
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,660
In my old head paradigm, there was like one

373
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,160
at Wes's house or something.

374
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,780
So what would be wrong with something like just a simple ZFS

375
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,000
receive and send?

376
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,160
When I started looking at it through the lens of Freenet

377
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
scale, I started thinking, what if this

378
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,720
would let me manage KVM and Docker containers across all

379
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,480
three of these systems?

380
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,560
You know, what if it let me kind of just trade it all

381
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,840
as one giant storage pool?

382
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,320
Then I started thinking, OK, maybe we could actually

383
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,120
start hosting quite a bit of applications

384
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,360
if we started doing that.

385
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,200
I don't know, I'm just kind of thinking,

386
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
before where I was thinking I was just

387
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,600
going to use a couple of the systems

388
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,560
as storage pass-through with mild compute,

389
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,760
now I'm thinking maybe I could use them all together.

390
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,520
And we still have a little bit of YOLO

391
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,200
because we want to make content.

392
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
That's true.

393
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,880
There's a lot of options in that space.

394
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,620
You could start looking at K3S, a very lightweight Kubernetes

395
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,600
with something like Rook and Ceph on the back end.

396
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,120
There's a lot of ways to skin that particular turkey.

397
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh, OK, turkey skin.

398
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,080
All right, yeah, well, we'll consult.

399
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,680
It's just been on my mind recently

400
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,800
and, you know, saw this true to that scale thing come along

401
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,960
and it had me thinking.

402
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,560
I like it.

403
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,280
You know, I am a little disappointed.

404
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,040
I was kind of hoping they'd figure out a way to make Docker.

405
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,400
Like, it seems clear with this that they kind of had to cede,

406
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:23,600
right?

407
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,040
Like, everyone's using Docker and Kubernetes these days.

408
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,500
I was still a little hopeful they'd

409
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,560
figured out some kind of jank on top of jails,

410
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,920
and that would have been neat.

411
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:38,080
Lino.com slash unplugged, go there to get $100 in 60 day

412
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,200
credit on a new account and you go there to support the show.

413
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,760
Lino provides virtual servers that

414
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,560
make it easy and affordable to host anything you want.

415
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,400
And I'm talking like a big old enterprise deployment

416
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,320
that will have millions of users,

417
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,600
or maybe you just need a portfolio,

418
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,040
or maybe you want to experiment with an open source project,

419
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,640
or try going from something that's

420
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,880
proprietary on the cloud like Zoom

421
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,640
to something you can host yourself like Jitsi.

422
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,800
So if you're into gaming, maybe you

423
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,160
want to host a gaming server.

424
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,360
What I'm trying to tell you is that Linode

425
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,240
has built a system that is 30% to 50% cheaper

426
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,840
than those big hypervisor duopolies out there,

427
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,920
but yet can provide enough horsepower

428
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,840
to run your entire enterprise.

429
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,120
Which means that's just a great option for everybody.

430
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,840
Developers also love Linode, and they

431
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:27,120
have one of the best, cleanest, and well-documented APIs

432
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,240
in the business.

433
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,400
People should take notes from Linode on how they do this.

434
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,800
I mean, they've been doing it for nearly 19 years,

435
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,880
so they get it right.

436
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,880
And for those of you who are into security,

437
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,880
like real nuts and bolts security,

438
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,000
this is something I probably should have mentioned earlier.

439
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,800
But Linode's security team publishes weekly Linode

440
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,400
security digests.

441
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,040
And they go through ranges of dates,

442
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,600
and they'll cover a series of things.

443
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,880
Like they posted one on February 25th, and one

444
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,720
on February 1st, et cetera.

445
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,560
And they are just packed full of good information.

446
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,240
You know, Linode's on the front lines of this kind of stuff.

447
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,280
Imagine what their security team is seeing.

448
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,200
And a while ago, they realized they

449
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,680
could help the industry do better

450
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,640
by sharing this information.

451
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,440
So if you're in the biz, go check that out.

452
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,880
We'll have a link in the show notes.

453
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,840
And while you're over there, go create a new account.

454
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,000
Go experiment.

455
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,560
Go try things and support the show.

456
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,400
There's never been a better time to take advantage of Linode

457
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,640
and learn something new, and maybe even build yourself

458
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,080
a bit of a multi-cloud strategy.

459
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,280
You know what I mean?

460
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,400
I think you do.

461
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,800
So sign up today at linode.com slash unplugged

462
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,920
and get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account

463
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,160
and support the show.

464
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,840
That's linode.com slash unplugged.

465
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,880
So if TrueNAS scale was the perfect server

466
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,840
for a small business, this next server

467
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,680
might be the personal perfect server for you

468
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,000
if you'd like to set up your own sovereign bank

469
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,680
and install a bunch of open source applications

470
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,240
we talk about all the time.

471
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,080
And we decided to talk about Umbral this week because

472
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,600
of the situation in Ukraine.

473
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,400
It's absolutely horrible what's happening.

474
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,520
We don't normally even touch on this kind of stuff in the show.

475
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,640
But a lot of us had the sense that we

476
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,200
wanted to do something.

477
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,680
And there's not really anything practical

478
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,760
that we could do from this distance

479
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,960
other than likely financially support the resistance,

480
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,320
the people specifically.

481
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,920
We have listeners in Ukraine.

482
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,160
I've heard from some of them.

483
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,560
Some of them are in our matrix room right now.

484
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,440
And so we feel for what's going on over there.

485
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,760
And we wanted to talk about Umbral in this context.

486
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,040
And as we start, I think it's noteworthy

487
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,720
that 107 Bitcoin have been sent over to Ukraine,

488
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,360
to the Ukrainian government on Twitter, a post,

489
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,200
I can't believe I'm saying this, posted their official crypto

490
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,080
address wallets for Ethereum and Bitcoin and whatnot

491
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,440
and have received an unbelievable amount of money.

492
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,760
I mean, I think we did the math.

493
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,520
And that's something like $4 million,

494
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,360
more than $4 million that's been sent now.

495
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,200
Every time we check the page, it's gone up.

496
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,000
They have spent 54 of the 107 Bitcoin

497
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,600
that's been sent to them.

498
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,840
I've heard from a listener that used some Bitcoin

499
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,400
to buy a car to get out of there.

500
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,800
The used car dealership started accepting Bitcoin.

501
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,080
It's incredible to watch all of this happen.

502
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,160
And that's kind of what got us thinking about this.

503
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,080
And the way Umbral fits in is Umbral is a software package

504
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,960
that you can run either on a Raspberry Pi,

505
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,640
or you could run it on an x86 box.

506
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,200
We find it works best if you use Ubuntu 20.04 and their script.

507
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,920
And what it does is it sets up a local Bitcoin node.

508
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,280
This doesn't mine.

509
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,400
It's not using your GPU.

510
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,560
It's not doing anything like that.

511
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,520
It's simply adding one more node to the consensus generation

512
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,080
network.

513
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,000
It's helping validate transactions.

514
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It helps decentralize the network

515
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,600
and keep the transactions secure.

516
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Following along and checking the math.

517
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,840
And the nice thing is you just install Umbral,

518
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,480
and you get the Bitcoin node as just part of its function.

519
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,600
It does take some space.

520
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,000
So you want to have about a terabyte of free space.

521
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,040
And it will run in the background.

522
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,480
You don't have to do anything.

523
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,440
And what you get with Umbral is essentially an app store

524
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,920
of some of the best open source apps that are out there.

525
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,360
Absolutely, Nextcloud is on that list.

526
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,720
Matrix is on that list.

527
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,400
Hosting your own Bitwarden server is on that list.

528
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,120
A lot of the things we, Home Assistant,

529
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,700
a lot of the things we talk about,

530
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,080
PyHole, Prism for photo library management,

531
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,560
that's all on there.

532
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,760
In addition to that, there is a suite

533
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,840
of software that lets you manage your Bitcoin stuff locally.

534
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,840
It is a node.

535
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,800
So you can use that as your own source of truth

536
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
for the Bitcoin network.

537
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,960
And you can point wallet applications at it.

538
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,480
And it can also act as a local bank for you.

539
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,240
So as an example, and I talk more about this

540
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,580
on a new podcast that a friend of the network

541
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,080
has launched called the Bitcoin Dad podcast,

542
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,320
I have set up family wallets.

543
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,540
So my kids all have wallets.

544
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,320
And they get allowance in Lightning Payments.

545
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,840
That lives on this node.

546
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,880
And you can do things like multi-sigs,

547
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,480
where you can have a key and your kids can have a key,

548
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,600
so the money can't be spent unless you both authorize

549
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,880
that money gets spent.

550
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,040
And they have software that lets you do that.

551
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,800
And you can also run a Lightning node,

552
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,520
which is how we're receiving and sending payments

553
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,600
and participating in that transaction network, which

554
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,840
I think has a lot of potential to help fund open source

555
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,240
software long term.

556
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,280
And I don't say that lightly.

557
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,200
So it offers a lot of features.

558
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,200
And I think one of the more noteworthy things about Umbral

559
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,000
is for both Brent and I, it made the Bitcoin thing real.

560
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,880
It took it from this nebulous concept into something

561
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,240
that we were hosting ourselves.

562
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,080
And we had full self-sovereignty over.

563
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,920
Yeah, I could tell.

564
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,240
Because I wasn't at the studio, but you guys

565
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,520
were doing all kinds of projects.

566
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,080
And I just get spammed with links from both of you

567
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,080
getting really excited about everything you were setting up.

568
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,800
I remember opening up, I was like, oh, this thing's got GITTI.

569
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,640
It's got Synapse.

570
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,600
But look at all this stuff.

571
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,760
It's like one button away.

572
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,760
And I'm like, OK, but it must be a mess under the hood.

573
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,560
And underneath, it's all very clean.

574
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,920
It's using NGINX as a proxy.

575
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,760
And then behind it is Docker.

576
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,880
And what it does is when you install an app,

577
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,080
it does like a git checkout that includes some information

578
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,440
and a Docker compose file.

579
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,080
And then it's doing a Docker compose run under the hood.

580
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,960
And then when it's doing updates for the quote unquote apps,

581
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,400
it's just pulling down a new image and deploying it.

582
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,240
And it's very clean.

583
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,000
And because of that, I've been able to actually dig around

584
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,960
in there and troubleshoot several things.

585
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,040
I talked recently about how Wes went in there

586
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,360
and helped us troubleshoot something with the Helipad

587
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,560
messaging system.

588
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,480
You can get in under the hood, and you can actually

589
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,120
see what it is and understand it.

590
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,780
Because it's all using good practices, common sense stacks.

591
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,880
It's not some weird black magic script thing

592
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,080
that's happening where it's doing all this weird stuff

593
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,680
on your box.

594
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,400
And so I like it from sort of an aesthetic,

595
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,880
as a former sys admin, I like it from that kind of standpoint

596
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,360
as well.

597
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,160
But when Brendan and I started working on this,

598
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,760
Brent, I had a sense from you, too,

599
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,440
that it brought it to something that was really tangible,

600
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,040
that it was participating in like a decentralized network.

601
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,280
Yeah, it certainly was something that we've

602
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,480
talked about over the years.

603
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,020
You know, oh, Bitcoin is super interesting,

604
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,520
and I knew you were getting into it.

605
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,560
But when we were together at the studio recently,

606
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,860
I don't know what brought us to just kind of totally dive

607
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,240
in full steam ahead.

608
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,560
But it just brought all these concepts together for me

609
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,680
to like this tangible piece of software

610
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,720
that you and I could discuss right in front of us.

611
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,480
Oh, let's try this.

612
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,280
Oh, what about this?

613
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,120
How does this work?

614
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,480
And not to mention, you know, some of the apps

615
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,880
are really quite a wonderful visualization

616
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,220
of how some of the Bitcoin technology works as well.

617
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,080
I found that really helpful as someone who visually, that's

618
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,920
a better way for me to kind of learn and grasp concepts.

619
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,040
So I just thought as a way to play with technology,

620
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,880
you know, I'm relatively new to some of the Docker stuff.

621
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,440
That was super fun.

622
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,400
And as a way to understand, you know,

623
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,480
some pretty neat technology like Bitcoin, that was really fun.

624
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,360
And just for you and I to be in the same room

625
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,980
doing this together was just an amazing experience.

626
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,040
And now we've sort of turned you into a reporter in the field,

627
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,040
because you've been setting up your own node, right?

628
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,840
Yeah, it's true.

629
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:28,160
You guys sicked me to go set up my own instance of Umbral.

630
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,700
And so the first time around, Chris,

631
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,080
you did all the heavy lifting.

632
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,080
I just kind of watched you and cheered you on.

633
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,760
But this time around, I got to really sink my teeth in.

634
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,680
Maybe as we standardly do, I don't

635
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,360
think I did it in a way that we would recommend.

636
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,860
So we just kind of booted up a VPS

637
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,520
and installed it on there, which I

638
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:48,280
don't know if that's the recommended way to do it.

639
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,080
I mean, I don't know.

640
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,840
Why not?

641
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,320
It could be a decent way to get a few apps.

642
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,480
The thing about with Linode is they just got,

643
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,520
you could do a one-click deployment of Nextcloud.

644
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,240
So you don't really need to install software that

645
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,080
helps you get Nextcloud going, you know what I mean,

646
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,040
that kind of thing.

647
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,800
But if you wanted one box and you

648
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,400
wanted to run several apps at once,

649
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,800
I might do it for the horsepower.

650
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,480
Well, I guess my question was, one of the obvious benefits

651
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,820
to us was kind of the throughput on the network

652
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,160
so we could download the blockchain

653
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,400
as quick as possible.

654
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,640
But the real question that I had around that was,

655
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,240
I know running your own node and having your own wallets

656
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,840
in a piece of software is, they even say it.

657
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,920
The Umbral folks suggest, don't be reckless about this.

658
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,420
This can be real money, so don't put anything on here

659
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,400
that you're not willing to lose, they specifically say.

660
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:35,960
So I wondered, maybe this is a question for all three of you,

661
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,880
is running a node like this super interesting and really

662
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,120
helpful to the Bitcoin network, and it

663
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,680
runs all these other pieces of software

664
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,720
that we really care about, and it makes it super easy.

665
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,200
But the question I have is, is it a good idea

666
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,240
to bundle these things?

667
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,960
Running a node and having your own Bitcoin

668
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,200
on a software wallet on there potentially is one risk,

669
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,200
but then you open up all of these other pieces

670
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,760
of software as potential attack surfaces?

671
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
What do you guys think?

672
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,680
I think it depends on how you use the node.

673
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,520
You could use the node as a source of truth

674
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,600
for a wallet software that you run on your machine.

675
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,920
Ideally, though, you don't want to store large amounts

676
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,440
of Bitcoin on any computer that's

677
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,200
connected to the internet.

678
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,480
It's just not a good practice in general, because as the value

679
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,800
of Bitcoin goes up, which eventually it

680
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,280
will do again one day, it'll become even more

681
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,840
of an enticing target.

682
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,800
So when they say don't keep anything you're not

683
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,280
willing to lose, that's essentially what they're saying.

684
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,120
I keep about $600 on my node.

685
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,600
You can actually see the information

686
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,320
if you look up the node address.

687
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,640
And I do that in part so I can add liquidity

688
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,560
to different channels.

689
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,400
We open up to people for different Bitcoin,

690
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,640
or yeah, lightning Bitcoin transactions.

691
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,720
But think of it more, Brent, not as a bank

692
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,040
where you store your money, but as your personal source

693
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,240
of truth for what is a transaction on the network

694
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,920
and when you submit a transaction.

695
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,920
It also lets you interface with the network

696
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,440
in sort of a first class way, like you're not using

697
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,000
an exchange or another third party.

698
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,760
Right.

699
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,520
It's definitely one of the more secure ways

700
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,040
to do that kind of thing.

701
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,760
And the node function doesn't take a lot of overhead,

702
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,760
because they've designed this thing to run on a Raspberry Pi.

703
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,640
So it's a nice kind of low key way to support the network.

704
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,760
And then you go into the app store.

705
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,200
And they have done a really good job of adding apps too,

706
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,880
because I've been running this since December.

707
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,640
And there's been probably about three updates since then.

708
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,360
And each update has added stuff, like the recent one

709
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,080
added tail scale.

710
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,200
And that's been really nice.

711
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,760
They a little while ago had uptime kuma added,

712
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,360
which I started using.

713
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,520
That's been really cool.

714
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,760
Yeah, it was interesting.

715
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,560
I kind of noticed like back in, I guess, August, a little

716
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,960
before we discovered it, but they had a blog post sort

717
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,960
of writing that Umbral isn't just a Bitcoin and Lightning

718
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,560
node.

719
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,680
It's a personal server OS that helps anyone

720
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,840
have control of their data.

721
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,320
And I guess that's like maybe that's

722
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,640
some of the motivation for having these things, right?

723
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,560
Once you're thinking about maybe how you're interfacing

724
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,680
with your various cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin

725
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,440
and Lightning, then you're also starting to wonder like, oh,

726
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,040
yeah, I am putting a lot of other stuff out

727
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,440
on the internet, aren't I?

728
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,640
Alex, I know you're not a big fan of the front end.

729
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,840
Let us set things up for you.

730
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,240
But there's a couple of exceptions.

731
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,880
You've got a little love for a couple of projects

732
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,400
out there like Unraid.

733
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,160
What do you think of something like Umbral

734
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,720
where it's, I think we have to be honest,

735
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,360
it's first a Bitcoin node.

736
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,680
But then one of the things they've done on the back end

737
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,200
is they've just added all this other stuff that's

738
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,880
become so popular.

739
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,080
I'd say like the top 20 self-hosted apps are on there.

740
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,200
It looks fantastic.

741
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,560
The design language that they're using for the interface

742
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
is just beautiful.

743
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,360
I look at it and I think, I wish I

744
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,680
could use this for everything.

745
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,800
I wish there was a plug-in, say, for MergerFS.

746
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,760
I wish there was a plug-in for SnapRaid,

747
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,880
all that kind of stuff, like out of the box.

748
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,240
Because I would genuinely be quite tempted

749
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,080
to see if this could replace my Proxmox deployment.

750
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,320
Because I don't really use very many virtual machines.

751
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,640
I run Home Assistant as a VM.

752
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,960
I run FedoraBox for IRC purposes for work

753
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,440
that has to be on a VPN.

754
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,200
Apart from that, I don't really utilize anything else

755
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,200
of Proxmox's virtualization features.

756
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,440
So I wonder, if we push this project further down the road,

757
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,800
is that a possibility for the future?

758
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:31,400
Like, can we work on a beautiful storage UI for this thing

759
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,240
and turn it into the base platform

760
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,720
for a future TrueNAS competitor?

761
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,560
From what I have gathered from the outside,

762
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,160
the dev team seems pretty easy to work with

763
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,440
and pretty willing to work with projects to integrate them.

764
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,520
And so far, because of the way they've

765
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,240
designed the base system, they seem

766
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,800
to be pretty flexible in what they can integrate.

767
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,880
And they do it in a clean way.

768
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,640
And I have installed stuff, removed stuff.

769
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,680
I've gone the whole, like, talk to a developer

770
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,100
to get a beta version of something

771
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,880
to get that installed.

772
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,160
Like, I've tried the whole gambit

773
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,200
of messing around with this thing.

774
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,520
And it's been really reliable.

775
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,720
It's really held up.

776
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,040
So the team seems to be very clever in how

777
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,160
they've built this.

778
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,760
I also like that, because it is so approachable,

779
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,080
it really is conceivable that a free software

780
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,800
project like the GNOME project, although they probably would

781
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,280
never want to associate with something as earth

782
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,040
incinerating as Bitcoin, but a project that

783
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,800
looked into the actual environmental impacts

784
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,680
would probably be willing to run something like this.

785
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,720
And then they would have their own lightning note.

786
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,320
And the reason why that is significant

787
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,520
is I could open up a channel to them.

788
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,960
And then they would be connected to a popular lightning

789
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,340
node that would be really quick and cheap to route through.

790
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,320
And it'd be their own self-custodial way

791
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,880
to receive contributions.

792
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,440
Like, that's a big deal.

793
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,840
Because right now, these projects

794
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,360
have to go through some third party.

795
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,720
There's some master.

796
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,040
There's some middleman.

797
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,600
And like, when we were just talking about contributing

798
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,040
to the Ukraine Defense Force, you're

799
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,920
contributing to Ukraine listeners,

800
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,360
Patreon just blocked a transaction because it was

801
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,920
going over to somebody in Ukraine.

802
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,520
And that kind of thing, the middleman,

803
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,360
even when they intend to do the right thing,

804
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,920
they often mess it up.

805
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,000
And when it comes to software and speech,

806
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,020
I just feel like we've got to get rid of the middleman

807
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,520
as much as possible.

808
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,980
And that's why I'm so compelled to talk about this right now.

809
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,680
Because I feel like having self-control

810
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,680
over this kind of stuff is more of a topic than ever.

811
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,080
Because it's not just what's going on in Ukraine.

812
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,080
There's all kinds of stuff going on right now.

813
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,120
And this gives people access.

814
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,200
And Umbral also sells a hardware product

815
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:41,320
that somebody who maybe has more money than they do time

816
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,080
could grab that and participate and have access

817
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,740
to a really solidly set up, self-hosted platform

818
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,320
with a lot of really cool apps on there.

819
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,760
And so I think it's worth a try.

820
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,780
Even if you don't use the Bitcoin stuff,

821
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,280
I suppose you could always SSH in and just stop the node

822
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,040
container.

823
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,120
Yeah, you know, XMN in the IRC was kind of asking,

824
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,580
is that, can you just use it for some of the more self-hosted

825
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,760
stuff and not have the Bitcoin parts?

826
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,160
I absolutely have shut off the node at times

827
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,040
when we were trying stuff.

828
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,200
So that is possible.

829
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,080
But I actually am striving for as much uptime as possible.

830
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,760
Brent was here doing construction work.

831
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,680
And I was like, don't shut down the Bitcoin node.

832
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,220
Yeah, it was days of negotiation to get you to accept

833
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,400
that the power might go off.

834
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,020
Yeah, because in the Lightning Network,

835
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,800
at least, your uptime matters.

836
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,520
They consider that part of your reliability.

837
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,560
OK, two things.

838
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,060
One, I think maybe we should mention

839
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,480
that they're using a particular license, the Polyform

840
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,480
non-commercial license, for folks that

841
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,520
care about that kind of thing.

842
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,520
And then I also was just noticing their hiring.

843
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,320
And that made me reflect that there

844
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,600
is a company behind this, right?

845
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,860
It's an open source project.

846
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,760
But also, there's more going on.

847
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,400
Yeah, they've raised some money.

848
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,280
They got $3 million in seed funding.

849
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,840
So they were, I think, able to do some hiring with that.

850
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,600
It's not a lot.

851
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,320
But you combine that with a hardware product

852
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,000
that maybe gets some sales.

853
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,360
It's a cool looking device.

854
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,320
It's a little expensive, though.

855
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,480
I don't know if you guys, if you go on their website,

856
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,680
they have two options.

857
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,360
And one of them is install on a Raspberry Pi.

858
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,320
And one of them is install Umbral on Linux.

859
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,240
We had the best results with Ubuntu.

860
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,860
But if you dig around their website,

861
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,240
they do offer hardware, or they used to.

862
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,320
Maybe they will again.

863
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,040
So talk me through the requirements of this thing,

864
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,200
in terms of disk space and all the rest of it.

865
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,000
Because are you syncing the entire blockchain down?

866
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,720
I don't really understand how it works.

867
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,880
We did have to do a little pre-planning for the show

868
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,200
to make sure Brent's experiment synced in time.

869
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
Yeah.

870
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,320
Yeah, I had to add some block storage to the Linode

871
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,440
that we were running it on.

872
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,680
Which, for me, was a great learning experience, actually.

873
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,960
So just putting that out there.

874
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,680
Yeah, just getting that disk attached to the system

875
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,200
and all that.

876
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,720
We'll get to Alex's question in a sec here.

877
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,720
But from the point of view of someone like me,

878
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,120
who is pretty Docker uninitiated and just playing

879
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,640
with all this technology and just curious about how it all

880
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,480
works, it was a fabulous experience

881
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,520
to go and have to attach some block storage to this

882
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,280
and do a little change in the Docker Compose file and stuff.

883
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,440
And it was a nice way to just kind of dip

884
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,040
my toe in some of these technologies.

885
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,960
And I had more fun than I expected, actually.

886
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,200
I'm feeling pretty giddy about it, actually.

887
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,720
It is a lot of fun.

888
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,640
So what your question was, Alex, about the blockchain download.

889
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,800
You download the blockchain.

890
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,040
I have some stats here.

891
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,600
Ours is using about 467 gigs for the blockchain storage.

892
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,480
So they recommend 600 gigs.

893
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,760
I think if you want some future proofing, around a terabyte

894
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,960
is probably a good idea.

895
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,880
That's why I said earlier, just plan for a terabyte for that.

896
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,040
And if that doesn't appeal to you,

897
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:42,000
you might not consider Umbral.

898
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,880
You might want to consider something else.

899
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,800
I will be honest.

900
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,720
Part of the draw for me is participating

901
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,400
in the decentralized consensus part of the network.

902
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,720
And the nice thing about Bitcoin is

903
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,600
that you can just install a node.

904
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,560
You can get it as a Docker container.

905
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,480
You don't have to participate in the mining, in any of that.

906
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,760
And you can still add value.

907
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,560
You can add decentralization.

908
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,420
That has always been something that I've loved.

909
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,120
I've always been into that kind of stuff,

910
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,840
for as long as I've been into computers.

911
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,600
So a terabyte would cut it then.

912
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,000
And presumably, that's going to grow over time.

913
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,600
Do you have any sense as to how much it's going to grow?

914
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,440
How quick?

915
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,120
I decided to put an eight terabyte disk in my machine,

916
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,500
I think is what I did, ultimately,

917
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,560
just to not worry about it for five, six, seven years.

918
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,340
But they say plan for a terabyte to two terabytes long term.

919
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,840
Or you mean you put an eight terabyte drive in there,

920
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,640
because that's what we shucked at the sprint

921
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,400
and what Brent found in a box.

922
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,360
Yeah.

923
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,100
Let's be honest.

924
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,000
That's our planning, really.

925
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,880
But I didn't partition it.

926
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,640
Yeah.

927
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,040
I'd say, I'm going to run this until the machine dies, really.

928
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,860
This is one of my, I'm not, I know it sounds ridiculous.

929
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,280
I'm not shitting you.

930
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,240
This is one of my most favorite projects

931
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,040
in probably the last four or five years I've done.

932
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,920
I just love it.

933
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,400
It has been so great.

934
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,840
And the community is so great.

935
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,320
And to participate in something as big as this

936
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,920
is, I think, an awesome opportunity.

937
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,400
And I love that it's free software.

938
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
I'm not just talking about Umbral.

939
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,680
I'm talking about Bitcoin.

940
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,640
I'm talking about Linux.

941
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,700
I'm talking about the Docker stuff that it's using.

942
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,740
It's incredible where this stack has gotten.

943
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,820
And it's pretty easy.

944
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,000
They give you information on how to submit your own app

945
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,440
to their app store, too.

946
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,560
I think one of those examples is one of the apps

947
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,120
that I think has been giving you a lot of the fun

948
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,660
is Helipad, which Dave Jones was just packaged up

949
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,440
and got included in Umbral, right?

950
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,160
It doesn't seem like it's a big hurdle

951
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,520
to get stuff added, which is important at this stage.

952
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,000
Yep.

953
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,920
That's very true.

954
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,040
Yeah, that's been a great app.

955
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,340
And that comes right in there.

956
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,800
And so when those boosts come into the show,

957
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,080
they come in via the Lightning Network.

958
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,800
And they sit on a node on my LAN.

959
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,200
And I think about this from a small business standpoint.

960
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,880
Imagine a future where free software projects and content

961
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,400
like JB is getting a significant bit of its funding

962
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,640
from micropayments directly from the audience at scale.

963
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,520
And the things like advertisers and those kinds of things

964
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,680
are maybe playing less and less of a role.

965
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,320
And this starts playing more and more of a role.

966
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,260
Now, how empowering is that, that that's

967
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,720
a box sitting on my LAN, right?

968
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,800
It's not a Stripe account.

969
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,880
It's not PayPal.

970
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,920
It's not my local bank.

971
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,040
It feels like a true value for value exchange,

972
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,760
where the audience is giving me something.

973
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,520
And they came into my storefront.

974
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,280
And then I'm taking it, and I'm putting it in a register,

975
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,340
a cash register that's there at my store.

976
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:41,560
It fundamentally changes the status of ownership.

977
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,240
And it feels like security to me.

978
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,280
It feels safe to me.

979
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,440
As a business, it feels like that is actually mine now

980
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,320
and not something that somebody else is holding for me

981
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,760
that they give me access to until they don't.

982
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,640
And that is a big shift.

983
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,000
Imagine a future where you can pay for a road trip using

984
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,960
those funds, where the audience think,

985
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,840
Chris has just put out a plea for a few dollars

986
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,760
to come to the East Coast in lady dupes.

987
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,360
Imagine a future where all of that is just local,

988
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,640
and the US dollar isn't really involved until you cash out.

989
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,140
Right.

990
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,200
That's a cool thing to think about, no?

991
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,400
I think so.

992
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,920
I think it gives people a lot of freedom.

993
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,640
I think it's pretty neat to see it happening.

994
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,720
And it's still a little early, but that's

995
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,760
usually when we start talking about this stuff.

996
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,080
It makes me think about when we went down the effort

997
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,560
of hosting our own email, not because you necessarily

998
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,280
should, but I think we also got some kind of giddy vibes

999
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,820
of like, oh, we just ran this thing,

1000
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:44,080
and now we're participating in a wider ecosystem.

1001
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,480
And there's a lot about this stuff

1002
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,880
that has those old internet era vibes.

1003
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,000
Thank you to our members at unpluggedcore.com.

1004
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,880
You're playing a big role these days keeping the show going.

1005
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,100
As a thank you, we give you access

1006
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,140
to the full live feed that's like, I don't know,

1007
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,760
way too much show.

1008
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,680
Irresponsibly long, that's what happens.

1009
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,760
That's true.

1010
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,240
Or option two is ad-free, nice and tight.

1011
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,120
Still got that nice Joe polish, just a little bit shorter.

1012
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,400
And that goes out in the feed when the show's ready.

1013
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:16,920
Your choice.

1014
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,080
Usually the longer live feeds out

1015
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,640
within about an hour of our recording or so.

1016
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,920
So it goes out pretty quick on a Sunday evening local time.

1017
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,920
We love your feedback.

1018
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,240
We want to make more and more of that a part of the show.

1019
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,640
Your ideas, your suggestions, your responses

1020
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,520
to what we've talked about, agree or disagree,

1021
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,560
linuxunplug.com slash contact, send it in over there.

1022
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,400
And our matrix community is always growing.

1023
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,840
There's people talking right now.

1024
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,600
Linuxunplug.com slash matrix.

1025
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,720
You never know, one day it may replace that chat

1026
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,840
embedded on the website.

1027
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,000
So why not get involved one night?

1028
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,880
You're sitting around, you got your beverage of choice,

1029
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,440
linuxunplug.com slash matrix.

1030
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,720
Go get it set up.

1031
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,560
The love plug is happening before the show on Sundays.

1032
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,680
I usually pop in there for a bit and say, holla.

1033
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,080
Or today I was chasing a power supply demon.

1034
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,040
Either way.

1035
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,480
And that's always going, really.

1036
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,480
I'd say set it up and pop in there on a Tuesday,

1037
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:09,960
see who's in there.

1038
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,480
Pop in there on a Monday, I don't know.

1039
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,040
Yeah, what could it hurt, you know?

1040
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,200
I mean, worst case, you make some new best friends

1041
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,600
and you'll have a lot of fun.

1042
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,640
That's the worst case.

1043
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,440
You got to do it.

1044
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,760
Linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

1045
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,960
That's where you get that action.

1046
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,440
And now, as the French say, it is time for Le Boost.

1047
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,560
Well, we'd like to say thank you to everyone for the boosts.

1048
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,920
We appreciate you very much.

1049
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,240
From anonymous sends 3,000 sats.

1050
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,040
And he says, what are your thoughts on the Simula VR?

1051
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,560
Brent, I know you saw the Simula VR

1052
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,680
and were getting pretty excited about it right away.

1053
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,000
So what are your thoughts?

1054
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,160
Yeah, I saw it early morning.

1055
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,440
And I think I spammed you guys pretty early in your time

1056
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,800
zone about a bunch of stuff.

1057
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,200
No need to apologize.

1058
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,480
Yeah, I guess we should say it's a Linux PC that's

1059
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,200
going to crowdfund, that's strapped to your face,

1060
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,920
and they are building their own window environment.

1061
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,880
With Godot.

1062
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,360
Yeah, in fact, I invited them on the show.

1063
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,880
They're looking into their schedules,

1064
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,920
but I haven't got a confirmation yet.

1065
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,360
So it's an Intel-based x86 box, fast Linux box, on your face,

1066
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,600
super high-res screen, optimized for text rendering.

1067
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,200
It seemed like it blew your socks off, Brent.

1068
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,120
Well, I think from a technical point of view

1069
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,040
and trying to accomplish some really great things point

1070
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,760
of view, it seemed like it was right up our alley.

1071
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,920
They're putting together a bunch of technologies in a way

1072
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,400
that we typically love.

1073
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,080
And Chris, part of the reason I got really excited

1074
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,680
was that you've basically been asking

1075
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,280
for this for a few months.

1076
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,360
I know you've been playing with VR at kind of a workstation,

1077
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,480
a virtual workstation for you that might

1078
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,600
solve a few of your problems.

1079
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,680
But don't you feel like this, running Linux and having

1080
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,520
a pretty powerful PC, I guess, on your face

1081
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,000
is an exciting development, if it could happen?

1082
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Yeah, if you would have asked me this question two weeks ago,

1083
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,300
I would have said, no, this is silly.

1084
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,800
This isn't going anywhere.

1085
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,320
Why are we doing this?

1086
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,800
But then for my birthday, I got the Oculus Quest.

1087
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,480
And it was perfect, really, because it's not something

1088
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,480
I would have expected.

1089
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,920
So it's one of those, like, my whole opinion has changed

1090
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:18,960
within a couple of weeks.

1091
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,480
I put it on, and I was like, OK, the gaming graphics

1092
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,340
are about exactly what I expected.

1093
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,240
It looks like a high-end Android phone graphics.

1094
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,800
Really well-done application experience, more polished

1095
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,240
than I expected.

1096
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:36,320
But the thing that blew me away was the virtual office stuff.

1097
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,520
And I'm not talking like the Facebook thing,

1098
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,220
but like just an app that was designed

1099
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,280
to just bring your screens.

1100
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,680
It supports multiple virtual desktops in Mac and Windows,

1101
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,520
and it supports one desktop in Linux.

1102
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,020
But I created this awesome, badass log cabin studio

1103
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,040
on top of a hill looking down on a lake

1104
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:59,360
with panoramic windows and a ginormous blue couch.

1105
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,000
And then I brought in five virtual screens.

1106
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,840
It was awesome.

1107
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,080
And I'm telling you, man, I sat there at my desk.

1108
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,320
We had my keyboard and mouse.

1109
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,920
So I put down the VR controllers,

1110
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,160
and I had all these screens.

1111
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,600
But each one's like 105 inches or something.

1112
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,160
I don't know.

1113
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,000
They're huge.

1114
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,400
And they're cool, curved, and they're like hovering there.

1115
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,040
And it was an awesome, isolated, focused experience.

1116
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,640
And it tamed my ADD monster, because it

1117
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,520
was like in a meditative place while also being in a home

1118
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,800
office, like the perfect, ultimate, infinite home office.

1119
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,120
And I took off the headphones, and I'm just sitting

1120
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,640
in LadyJuice's passenger seat.

1121
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,680
Seems like it might have a pretty decent spousal approval

1122
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,160
factor.

1123
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,680
For one, you're not cluttering things up

1124
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,320
with as many monitors as you want.

1125
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,280
But then two, she can kind of laugh at you

1126
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,420
while you're getting your work done looking

1127
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,920
funny with the visor on.

1128
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,960
Totally, totally, yeah.

1129
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,000
If you want to get in the zone and drop away

1130
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,480
all the distractions, it really works for that.

1131
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,640
And I was surprised.

1132
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,880
And so what they're working on with Simula

1133
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,920
is doing that for Linux.

1134
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,880
And we covered it a little bit in Linux Action,

1135
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,200
is including the Window Manager stuff and all of that.

1136
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:09,520
The only obvious issue is that, A, I

1137
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,400
think people are going to be pretty skeptical.

1138
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,900
You've got to try it before you're going to buy it.

1139
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,880
Like me, two weeks ago, I just would

1140
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,440
have said this is ridiculous.

1141
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,240
So you've got to try it before you're

1142
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,640
going to understand it, I feel like, for most people.

1143
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,720
And then the other thing is the price.

1144
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,600
Because they're going for something that's

1145
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,960
good performance with a modern Intel chipset

1146
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,840
and the high resolution screen that

1147
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:35,040
makes text look actually good, the price of that is high.

1148
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,520
And a good one's $4,000.

1149
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,080
The starter one's like $2,000.

1150
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,820
And it's tough.

1151
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,200
I mean, I guess when you consider

1152
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,160
it's also a PC that's detachable.

1153
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,080
I think one way to look at it for you, Chris,

1154
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,080
might be how much would you spend

1155
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:53,480
to take jupes out into a spot where you had the view that you

1156
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,680
had and sit there for being as productive as you were

1157
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,200
for even that hour that you were playing with it?

1158
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,000
Yeah, I will say the one thing that I thought about when

1159
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,280
I was trying the Oculus was like, well, this is great.

1160
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,280
But in order to use this, I always

1161
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,520
have to have a computer with me.

1162
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,920
So I have to have both devices.

1163
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,840
That's kind of lame.

1164
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,880
I might as well just use my laptop then, right?

1165
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,120
And then I don't have to.

1166
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,400
But if this is the computer too, well, that's something,

1167
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,000
actually.

1168
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,960
Then you've just got your little launch keyboard

1169
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,040
that you drag out, and away you go.

1170
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,600
I got a lot of questions.

1171
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,760
I'm skeptical.

1172
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,080
The price is tough.

1173
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,160
I'm worried about the heat.

1174
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,880
I think we've got to, if we can get them on,

1175
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,080
I'd like to just talk to somebody

1176
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,480
about some of those things.

1177
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,560
But I would say if you are skeptical,

1178
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,680
it's just worth considering that there may actually

1179
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:40,080
be a use case, I think especially

1180
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,020
for developers who like to have multiple monitors.

1181
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,620
Would you like to have eight monitors, three monitors?

1182
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,820
How many monitors do you want?

1183
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,140
You can have as many monitors as you want,

1184
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,240
as many screens as you want.

1185
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,900
You can have them all over the place.

1186
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,600
You can have them spatially in different locations.

1187
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,600
It's very powerful.

1188
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,680
You know, I, Chris, when we were talking about this off scene,

1189
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,720
I got inspired to watch Ready Player One, which

1190
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,160
I had never seen before.

1191
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,000
And it just made me realize that that's exactly what you're

1192
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,240
talking about, basically a whole simulated VR world where you

1193
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,280
can do just about anything you want.

1194
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,400
I thought it was really fascinating.

1195
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,440
Yeah, let's just hope it's not dystopia, you know?

1196
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,480
We'll see.

1197
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:17,400
We'll see.

1198
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,720
Our next boost is from Mollusk.

1199
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,740
I think Chris and Dylan should play the free trial of Final

1200
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,320
Fantasy XIV online.

1201
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,600
I've been having a blast playing nonstop for the last year

1202
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,000
with my spouse.

1203
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,640
The Loot Trace option for the third party launcher

1204
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,400
works great as long as each other launcher

1205
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,360
to use Aria 2 for downloading, which Aria 2 is great.

1206
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,460
So that's just a great pro tip.

1207
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:42,640
I am only Crystal Data Center if you guys need help.

1208
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,440
Go podcasting.

1209
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,120
Thank you, Mollusk.

1210
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,760
That was a great 500 sets.

1211
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:49,040
Yeah, OK.

1212
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,640
I'm totally looking for a co-op kind of play together game

1213
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,520
I could do with one or two of the kids.

1214
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,720
So I'll totally check that out.

1215
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:59,280
And I also think, Mollusk, that when I do get the deck,

1216
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,280
I think the first thing I'm going to try doing

1217
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,400
is putting Loot Trace on that, right?

1218
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,120
That just seems like the first thing you do

1219
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,960
is get Loot Trace going on a deck.

1220
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,600
So that's going to be awesome too.

1221
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,440
Hudson writes in to say, boosting for boost,

1222
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,400
it's amazing to have a current use for Bitcoin

1223
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,620
other than just saving it away for myself.

1224
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,960
I feel so much more involved with JB and Bitcoin

1225
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,640
through value for value.

1226
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,360
I agree.

1227
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:24,000
These messages, when they come in, these little boosts

1228
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,960
are the highlight of my day.

1229
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,280
I usually have it up on one of my monitors,

1230
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,080
get a little pew noise, and I get a little note

1231
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,400
from somebody.

1232
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,840
And sometimes it's just the SATs,

1233
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,840
and I get to know what episode they're listening to

1234
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,240
or something like that.

1235
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,360
But there are a lot of tools that are being built.

1236
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:44,360
XOXOXO sent in 333 SATs.

1237
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,000
3,333 SATs, yeah.

1238
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,560
Four days ago, he said, I'm working on a boost CLI.

1239
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,240
It'll send boost-o-grams to podcasts, also on a boost bot

1240
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,880
for IRC, Matrix, and Mastodon.

1241
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,240
I thought that was notable, because now you

1242
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,400
can start seeing maybe you could support a developer

1243
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,640
or a podcast from their Matrix room with a Matrix bot.

1244
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,720
Yeah, and we need these kind of handy things

1245
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,460
just to sort of lower the barrier to entry,

1246
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,680
make it really easy to show your love.

1247
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,320
And then another app I'm looking at from the user side

1248
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,960
is, so somebody wants to get in on this,

1249
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,760
but they want to get into the boost system

1250
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,260
and send us boost messages, but they

1251
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,520
don't want to go get Cast-O-Matic or Fountain.

1252
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:26,440
Breeze, B-R-E-E-Z, is an app that

1253
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,800
is in development for both Google and for Apple phones.

1254
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,320
So you've got to get it from the Play Store or the App Store.

1255
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,280
And right now, it's in beta, so you either

1256
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,040
have to have TestFlight or you have

1257
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,200
to agree to a Play Store beta agreement.

1258
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,520
Either way, it's an app that'll also

1259
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,720
let you listen to podcasts and get in and send messages

1260
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,940
and stuff like that.

1261
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,480
It's pretty cool, and I'm keeping an eye on it

1262
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,360
because it's in early days, but the developer

1263
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,720
seems really sharp.

1264
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,560
And the app seems like it has a lot of options.

1265
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,440
It's pretty exciting.

1266
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,080
I guess we could consider that our pick for this week.

1267
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,500
Should we consider that our pick, Breeze, B-R-E-E-Z?

1268
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,720
I think you just did.

1269
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,800
There you go.

1270
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,480
That's a lot.

1271
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,040
It all kind of ties together.

1272
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,040
It's not like we're going to focus on this stuff

1273
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,960
all the time, but it felt today like this

1274
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,120
was our way to contribute to the conversation that's

1275
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,980
going on without talking directly about the politics

1276
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,640
and all that kind of stuff that this show doesn't

1277
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:16,400
need to get into.

1278
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,160
Hopefully, you forgot a little bit

1279
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,840
for this one little hour about the rest of the world.

1280
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,560
Yeah, you know how you can really tune out?

1281
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,320
You really get in is when you get the live experience,

1282
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,120
right?

1283
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,080
You either become a member or you show up.

1284
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,500
You can do that on Sundays if you

1285
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,440
want to do that at noon Pacific.

1286
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,000
We're hanging out over at jblive.tv.

1287
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,680
I suppose one of the ways you could get the show

1288
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,920
is by subscribing to our Twitch page.

1289
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,920
Hey, there he is.

1290
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:40,800
You go over there somehow.

1291
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,600
I don't know.

1292
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,400
I don't even know what Twitch calls it.

1293
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,560
Do you twatch over there?

1294
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,760
You go over there and you twatch to our channel.

1295
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,600
We need you, dear audience, to go find out and then report back

1296
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,920
whatever the terminology is.

1297
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,920
And if you ever looked at the title

1298
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,600
and been like, I like that title of an episode,

1299
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,640
or you look at the title and go, that title sucks,

1300
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,240
it's your fault, literally your fault.

1301
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,560
Yes, you, because you didn't show up live and submit

1302
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,360
a better one, because when people are live,

1303
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,020
they can bang suggest a title.

1304
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,600
That's exclamation mark and suggest it.

1305
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,600
Get it together, Steve.

1306
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,360
We need your help.

1307
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,480
That's right.

1308
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:09,960
I know.

1309
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,280
We were saying that.

1310
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,720
And they showed up on Sunday and they title suggest,

1311
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,840
and then we vote on it.

1312
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,160
See you next week.

1313
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,320
Same bad time, same bad station.

1314
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,160
In the meantime, you can just subscribe and get

1315
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,280
the show when we release it, not have

1316
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,560
to worry about any of that BS.

1317
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,560
You just go to linuxunplugged.com slash subscribe.

1318
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,920
Hey, if you would, leave us a review in your podcast app

1319
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,840
of choice.

1320
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,080
If it's the Apple Podcast, you know,

1321
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,800
we got like 20% of you now on the Apple Podcast.

1322
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,480
Have you given us a review recently?

1323
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,840
Wouldn't it be nice?

1324
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,720
I think so.

1325
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,280
I think it'd be real nice.

1326
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,120
That'd be real great.

1327
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,000
Or tell a friend, tell a friend that's also great.

1328
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,760
Or become a member for the whole network

1329
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,040
and support us financially at jupyter.party.

1330
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,960
There's a lot going on.

1331
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,240
Things are shifting, so we appreciate you being there

1332
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,000
and coming along for the ride.

1333
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:55,840
It's a new frontier.

1334
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,720
And I'll see you right back here next Sunday.

1335
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:12,520
See you then.

1336
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:39,880
All right, let's title this thing JBtitles.com, JBtitles.

1337
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,080
You know, one of the apps that I had a lot of fun with on Umbral was, well, you know,

1338
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,880
I had to install a bunch of them just for fun.

1339
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,280
But there's one called Mempool, Chris, if you play with this one.

1340
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,560
Super cool way to visualize what's going on on the blockchain.

1341
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,560
Yeah.

1342
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:57,320
Yeah, I ended up just kind of watching because it lists transactions as they're coming through

1343
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:03,520
and I ended up just kind of like watching it as you might a bonfire or I don't know.

1344
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,840
It was it was really neat.

1345
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:10,480
And I saw a transaction come through that was wild, Chris.

1346
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,320
It was twenty eight thousand five hundred Bitcoin.

1347
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,320
Whoa.

1348
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,320
Whoa.

1349
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,320
OK.

1350
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,320
Let's OK.

1351
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,320
Let's do the math on that.

1352
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,320
Twenty eight thousand five hundred BTC.

1353
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,920
You're saying BTC in USD is what that is in USD is not.

1354
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,920
Can I type that into Google?

1355
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,520
I feel like I should be able to type that into Google.

1356
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,960
I tried to do it with DuckDuckGo before and it didn't it didn't work.

1357
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,960
I was really.

1358
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,960
DuckDuckGo doesn't do it.

1359
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:34,960
That seems like obvious.

1360
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,960
I know.

1361
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:36,960
I know.

1362
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,960
No way.

1363
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,960
No way.

1364
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,960
All right.

1365
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,960
Well, anyways, I got a converter.

1366
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:41,960
I got a calculator here.

1367
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,960
I can do that.

1368
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:43,960
But that just seems obvious.

1369
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:44,960
So they should have that built in.

1370
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,960
Right.

1371
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,960
Now, well, Chris remembers how to do math.

1372
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,960
JBtitles.com everyone.

1373
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:48,960
Oh, yeah.

1374
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,960
There you go.

1375
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,960
So is that.

1376
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,120
Boy, that's a lot of numbers.

1377
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:57,240
I don't even know because it just gives me a here, you know, numbers are hard.

1378
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,180
So here's the number in USD.

1379
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:02,760
That's the oh, here we go.

1380
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,760
What is that?

1381
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,760
Is that one hundred and six million?

1382
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,760
Is that what that is?

1383
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,760
Got to put some commas in here.

1384
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,760
I know.

1385
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,760
That's the problem.

1386
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,480
So I put commas in.

1387
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,000
So we got one, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three.

1388
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,360
I'm seeing one point one billion.

1389
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,920
That was one transaction that I saw come across.

1390
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,880
OK, that makes sense.

1391
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,880
That makes sense.

1392
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:22,880
No, one point one.

1393
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:23,880
One point one billion.

1394
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:24,880
Yeah.

1395
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:25,880
Rounding up.

1396
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:26,880
Yeah.

1397
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,880
That makes sense.

1398
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:28,880
Isn't it ten billion?

1399
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,880
We're all good at math, right?

1400
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,880
I thought Google did this.

1401
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,960
If you're using DuckDuckGo, use bang WA.

1402
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,960
What's bang WA?

1403
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,960
Wolfram Alpha.

1404
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:36,960
No.

1405
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,960
Bren was.

1406
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,960
Bren was right.

1407
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,960
Oh.

1408
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,960
Bang WA, huh?

1409
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,960
All right.

1410
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,480
I love, ironically, searching Google for DuckDuckGo just so that I hope somewhere.

1411
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,480
I hope somewhere at Google they have a metric of how many people are searching for Bing

1412
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:50,480
and DuckDuckGo.

1413
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,480
All right.

1414
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:52,480
So.

1415
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:53,480
All right.

1416
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,480
I will try it with Wolfram Alpha.

1417
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,480
Wolfram, if I can say it.

1418
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,480
Yeah.

1419
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,160
You know, there's definitely a Grafana dashboard for searching for Google or searching for

1420
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,160
DuckDuckGo in there.

1421
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,160
That would please me.

1422
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,000
You know, just a little insecurity of it all would please me.

1423
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
OK.

1424
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
They did it.

1425
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Yep.

1426
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
It's one point one billion, according to the Wolf.

1427
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,280
That was one transaction I saw kind of speed past the screen in a small flash along with

1428
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,280
a bunch of other transactions.

1429
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,280
Yeah.

1430
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,960
And it was just like really landed at home, like what is happening on the network?

1431
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,240
Some serious money.

1432
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:24,360
Oh, yeah.

1433
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:28,020
If you think that's one transaction between, I don't know, two wallets or so, what else

1434
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,280
is happening that I'm not seeing?

1435
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,280
It's wild.

1436
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,780
It's all there.

1437
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,200
It's all open.

1438
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:52,360
Anyone can see it.
