00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 229, a very special holiday edition.

00:24.880 --> 00:27.440
Oh, hello, everybody, and welcome to Linux Unplugged.

00:27.440 --> 00:33.040
This is your off-schedule weekly Linux talk show, where we're going to get together

00:33.040 --> 00:37.360
and have a very special holiday edition. I'm joined by the one, the only, Mr. Wes Payne.

00:37.360 --> 00:38.160
Hey, Wes.

00:38.160 --> 00:38.400
What?

00:38.400 --> 00:40.800
Hello, Wes. Hello, Wes. Sorry, I was stepping on your mute button.

00:40.800 --> 00:41.760
That's right, you were.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.440
You know, it's a holiday edition. I do those kinds of things.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.440
I like to talk. You got to shut me up sometimes.

00:46.160 --> 00:49.920
But you know what I was really doing is I was busy unmuting the only kernel Linux of the team.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.040
Hello, Noah. Welcome.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.560
Hey, as it turns out, I have my own mute button too, so.

00:54.560 --> 00:58.720
Well, you know what? Happy holidays. It's like it's a holiday extravaganza.

00:58.720 --> 01:03.360
We ended up getting together and saying, what could we do that we would actually

01:03.360 --> 01:06.960
like to talk about for the holiday special? Because we've got special holiday music.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.080
We've got a special holiday just us.

01:10.080 --> 01:11.440
We're all in our Christmas garb.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.080
You know, as we sit here and record the show,

01:14.080 --> 01:17.920
there's a little elf in the background too that is going around and moving out of the studio.

01:19.040 --> 01:23.040
So it's a very special holiday episode. We thought we would look back at the year in Linux

01:23.040 --> 01:27.120
and talk about some of the top moments that affected us and affected the show,

01:27.120 --> 01:29.440
affected the course of Linux and all of those kinds of things.

01:29.440 --> 01:32.480
So it's a it's a wide range of things.

01:32.480 --> 01:35.760
And we just got done doing a little holiday celebration here in the studio.

01:36.320 --> 01:40.480
We did a little holiday burger, some holiday booze.

01:40.480 --> 01:41.840
Yeah. Oh, that's important.

01:41.840 --> 01:45.280
Noah, are you doing anything special for the holiday version over there in Grand Forks?

01:45.280 --> 01:46.080
Is it snowing yet?

01:47.440 --> 01:49.680
I'm not doing anything. Yeah. Jesus, it's snowing.

01:49.680 --> 01:53.600
We live. We have we you know, we got dumbed on five or 10 inches.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.800
And I finally ended up blowing my driveway out.

01:56.800 --> 02:02.080
And the there's a there's a big rigmarole with the trying to get the city out to plow the streets

02:02.080 --> 02:04.240
because there's been like, you know, there's people running here.

02:05.440 --> 02:07.120
No, no, seriously, I can't even make this up.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.520
There are people running into the back of the snow plows.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.000
Only in Grand Forks, dude.

02:14.960 --> 02:19.440
Gigantic yellow snow plows with big flashing lights on the top of them.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.720
Like, apparently they missed that.

02:20.720 --> 02:26.160
Yeah. You know, I mean, not to make you angry, but what it's like here in Washington for the holidays

02:26.160 --> 02:29.600
is I had my window open in my bedroom last night because I got too warm.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.520
So that was so there you have it. All right.

02:33.520 --> 02:38.560
Well, you know, I know it's perfect that you're able to join Wes and I for this episode because

02:38.560 --> 02:42.160
some of the biggest moments this year that we all experienced were together.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.760
The three of us had a huge year.

02:45.760 --> 02:50.480
This show and the other shows that we do gave us the opportunity to experience some significant

02:50.480 --> 02:52.000
moments up front.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.560
So I thought we would start with the most self-serving.

02:55.360 --> 02:56.080
Absolutely.

02:56.080 --> 03:02.000
This was the year that we ended the Linux Action Show at Linux Fest Northwest 2017.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.080
It was our last episode of Linux Action Show.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.040
Rest in peace, Laz.

03:05.040 --> 03:05.760
What do you think, Noah?

03:05.760 --> 03:07.200
Like, like post-mortem.

03:07.200 --> 03:12.800
Now, here we are almost it's been, what, 10 months, 11 months since then post-mortem.

03:12.800 --> 03:13.760
It doesn't feel that long.

03:13.760 --> 03:14.320
No, it doesn't.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.920
It doesn't feel that long.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.880
I guess there's obviously things I miss about it.

03:18.880 --> 03:21.520
There's obviously things I like doing about the show and things I miss about it.

03:22.800 --> 03:29.600
But, you know, it's interesting because it has given the network and me personally,

03:29.600 --> 03:35.840
and you personally, a bunch of different new directions that we're able to do things in

03:35.840 --> 03:38.320
a different way and in a lot of ways, better ways.

03:38.320 --> 03:39.600
And I think that's a really good thing.

03:39.600 --> 03:44.560
And I also think it has kind of future-proofed Jupiter Broadcasting because it really feels

03:44.560 --> 03:47.520
like the content we're producing now is sustainable.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.480
And I'm not sure that I necessarily believe that was true about Laz.

03:50.480 --> 03:50.560
Right.

03:50.560 --> 03:51.760
This kind of proves it out, right?

03:51.760 --> 03:53.280
That this is the post-Laz era.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.360
We weren't just riding in the tailcoats of Laz.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.640
There's original stuff here.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.640
That is a good point.

03:58.640 --> 04:04.240
Yeah, really, it does sort of, was it all just because of Laz or was it where the other

04:04.240 --> 04:05.520
show is also holding up the tent?

04:05.520 --> 04:08.720
Whether or not that was a tenable argument, you could definitely make it because it was

04:08.720 --> 04:09.920
the anchor.

04:09.920 --> 04:13.680
And it somehow, even though all the rumors are going wild that Noah and I were at each

04:13.680 --> 04:16.400
other's throats, here we are all these months later still hanging out.

04:16.400 --> 04:19.840
You know, one of the things I think we did right was after Linux Action Show wrapped

04:19.840 --> 04:25.440
up, you and I packed up our families and we went to Montana and just had like some unwinding

04:25.440 --> 04:27.520
just like, we're not podcasting.

04:27.520 --> 04:32.240
We're not, you podcasted, I vlogged, but it didn't feel like a work trip, you know?

04:32.880 --> 04:33.520
No, yeah.

04:34.240 --> 04:34.560
I don't know.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.560
Here's the thing, that was one of those things.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.840
People were saying we were at each other's throats long before Laz ended.

04:39.840 --> 04:40.240
That's true.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.040
So I mean, it was like...

04:41.040 --> 04:43.360
That's just because you could just catch us on a bad day.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.640
It might actually be true.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.680
I'm wondering, Noah, do you feel any different relationship with the network?

04:49.680 --> 04:53.120
You know, like before it was kind of like you and Chris were here on this anchor show

04:53.120 --> 04:56.800
and I mean, obviously you're still a big part of it, but you're off in your own Ask Noah

04:56.800 --> 04:57.520
world in a way.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.000
Yeah, it's true.

04:58.000 --> 05:02.960
Yeah, I definitely feel less connected to Jupiter broadcasting the network.

05:02.960 --> 05:07.680
However, I'd say Chris and I probably talk more now than we did...

05:07.680 --> 05:08.400
Oh, interesting.

05:08.400 --> 05:08.880
Yeah.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.200
You know, maybe because there's a lot of stuff we would save for...

05:11.200 --> 05:15.040
Well, there was a lot of this stuff we'd say, oh shit, we got to save that for the show.

05:15.600 --> 05:19.440
Where now we can just, we can have like a 15 message telegram thread about it.

05:20.160 --> 05:20.400
Right.

05:20.400 --> 05:25.280
So I think, I think, I think personal wise, I think Chris and my personal relationship

05:25.280 --> 05:30.320
has grown, but I think definitely I've wandered astray, not wandered astray, but I've become

05:30.320 --> 05:32.880
less involved with the network as a whole for sure.

05:32.880 --> 05:33.120
Right.

05:33.120 --> 05:38.160
Although it's like, you know, we listen to every episode, Noah and I almost always talk

05:38.160 --> 05:40.160
about every show of Ask Noah afterwards.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.600
Like we compare notes and stuff, but in a way...

05:43.600 --> 05:45.360
Earlier today we were talking about Tech Snap.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.680
But in a way it also feels like it's Noah's best work.

05:49.680 --> 05:56.320
Like not to take away from what you did with Last, but there is an aspect to Ask Noah that

05:56.320 --> 06:02.400
is sort of, if you give somebody some rope, they can either hang themselves or they can

06:02.400 --> 06:05.600
really do, they can do like some impressive acrobatics.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.720
And that's what Noah has done now is like, because there's a bunch of behind the scenes

06:08.720 --> 06:14.640
stuff I know about too, but you know, I've also, I've also seen Noah incorporate some

06:14.640 --> 06:19.440
harsh criticism into a show, back into the show in a way that improved it too.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.240
So part of it is, and I feel like you'll really understand this and anyone out there that

06:24.240 --> 06:29.680
creates content will understand this, the ability to at a moment's notice say...

06:29.680 --> 06:30.240
Change your mind.

06:30.960 --> 06:31.920
Yeah, change your mind.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.000
And then it doesn't matter because it's only you.

06:34.000 --> 06:38.320
And there have been, there's been plenty of episodes where three hours, four hours before

06:38.320 --> 06:42.000
I've gone on the air, I've dumped a week's worth of prep and said, nope, we're doing

06:42.000 --> 06:42.560
this instead.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.680
And it usually, it works out to work out really well.

06:45.680 --> 06:51.440
Yeah, I've enjoyed then when we do get together, it's like we sort of have pent up things to

06:51.440 --> 06:52.080
talk about.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.040
So I think it's helped.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.320
Yes, yes.

06:54.320 --> 06:57.680
And you know, the other thing is, yeah, well, I guess this kind of, this kind of says the

06:57.680 --> 06:58.080
same thing.

06:58.080 --> 07:02.720
But the other thing is, is that we have different experiences then too, where if, you know,

07:02.720 --> 07:06.880
when you're prepping a show all weekend together and agreeing on the topics and doing it, which

07:06.880 --> 07:08.640
means we're both using the same operating system.

07:08.640 --> 07:09.920
We're both using the same software.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.440
We're both doing the same things.

07:11.440 --> 07:14.720
And so when you get together and you go, well, I've been off here doing these things and

07:14.720 --> 07:15.920
you've been off doing those things.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.640
Now let's talk about how they intermingle.

07:18.640 --> 07:19.280
Yeah.

07:19.280 --> 07:24.880
And so that was sort of the weight that Linux Fest last year had.

07:24.880 --> 07:28.800
And now we're just around the corner going to Linux Fest again.

07:28.800 --> 07:32.480
And I feel like it's going to be one of our best ones ever just because we're going to

07:32.480 --> 07:36.320
go, we're going to do some show stuff there, but we're going to go more as just people

07:36.320 --> 07:39.680
to hang out, talk about open source, talk to other Linux users.

07:40.800 --> 07:45.920
I almost feel like Linux Fest Northwest 2018, I hope, will be more like Linux Fest was for

07:45.920 --> 07:47.920
me a decade ago, but we'll see.

07:48.800 --> 07:48.960
Yeah.

07:48.960 --> 07:54.400
And being able to attend that stuff as an attendee is way better, way better than doing

07:54.400 --> 07:57.760
it as a, well, I have to sit behind this booth the entire time because people are going to.

07:57.760 --> 07:58.000
Yeah.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.560
Although we are going to do, like you're going to try to do Ask Noah there, right?

08:01.280 --> 08:01.760
Absolutely.

08:01.760 --> 08:04.880
But what I'm saying is there's a difference, there's a difference between, there's a difference

08:04.880 --> 08:10.000
between going, setting up a booth and me doing Ask Noah for an hour and you doing Linux Action

08:10.000 --> 08:15.280
News and Westcoming to do Unplugged and that's different than you and I anchoring the entire

08:15.280 --> 08:16.320
thing from start to finish.

08:17.200 --> 08:17.440
All right.

08:17.440 --> 08:22.160
Well, while we are talking about things that sort of played a big role in the rest of the

08:22.160 --> 08:27.840
year towards the beginning of the year, in January, January 10th, 2017 on Linux Unplugged

08:27.840 --> 08:33.840
episode 179, we had a show called Project Sputnik Interview where Barton George from

08:33.840 --> 08:37.680
Dell came on to talk about some of the new hardware for Project Sputnik.

08:38.560 --> 08:47.280
This was a bit of a snowball effect that eventually led to Noah and I at Dell in Austin, Texas

08:47.280 --> 08:48.800
later on in the year.

08:48.800 --> 08:55.600
And it took some behind the scenes setup, but this was for me one of the biggest shifts

08:55.600 --> 09:04.080
that I've had in years because I went in with pretty open-minded expectations and walked

09:04.080 --> 09:10.480
out of there seeing a company grappling with deploying Linux to a certain subset of users

09:10.480 --> 09:12.960
and like really learning how to do it.

09:13.760 --> 09:18.480
Watching a company that's gone through a transition and it really shifted my view of the Linux

09:18.480 --> 09:23.920
hardware market and the Linux user base that are actually buying hardware, like new hardware

09:23.920 --> 09:24.960
and not building PCs.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.600
I mean, there's so much in that Dell visit for me, Noah, that I feel like I almost can't

09:31.600 --> 09:33.200
even give it justice just talking about it.

09:33.200 --> 09:37.920
But I feel like if you got the ball rolling on our visit to Dell, I could probably, you

09:37.920 --> 09:38.880
could probably get me going.

09:38.880 --> 09:39.600
But what do you think?

09:39.600 --> 09:42.720
Like looking back at our visit to Dell, it seems like it was a big moment of 2017.

09:43.840 --> 09:44.160
Yeah.

09:44.160 --> 09:51.120
So we, if you think about it, what people saw, what people know, what people experienced

09:51.120 --> 09:54.080
of our visit probably represents less than one percent.

09:54.080 --> 09:54.320
Wow.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.720
We took three or four days worth of footage and condensed that.

10:00.720 --> 10:05.520
And I can, well, us together, we condensed it down and down and down and down and down

10:05.520 --> 10:06.320
and down.

10:06.320 --> 10:10.400
And then you'll remember like we were literally sitting there and I was like, it was as bare

10:10.400 --> 10:12.160
bones and I was like, man, we barely used anything.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.320
And you're like, we got to make that tighter.

10:14.320 --> 10:16.560
And then we cut a whole bunch more out.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.840
And so, yeah, it really represented a tiny fraction.

10:19.840 --> 10:24.960
But and the thing that we couldn't really explain and part of it was our bad as content

10:24.960 --> 10:30.960
creators for not finding a way to capture this or explain this better was you had recurring

10:30.960 --> 10:34.000
themes and ideas that were shared among everyone in the company.

10:34.640 --> 10:39.840
And it would come up in passing conversation enough that we were able to say, OK, these

10:39.840 --> 10:41.040
people really care about Linux.

10:41.040 --> 10:41.920
It's not just an act.

10:41.920 --> 10:44.000
It's not just numbers for them.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.360
They're really passionate people here.

10:46.560 --> 10:49.040
And that's something that I don't think the video really did justice.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.400
But when you're there and you experience that kind of energy, it changes you.

10:52.400 --> 10:56.400
And like you said before we started recording, it gives you a whole different perception

10:56.400 --> 10:56.960
of the company.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.480
Yeah, it seems like that's the narrative has changed or like how I think about it before.

11:02.480 --> 11:03.920
It was like, yeah, OK, Project Sputnik.

11:03.920 --> 11:04.320
That's cool.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.680
Dell has this like small little thing on the back burner now.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.200
It also is just in the larger community.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.880
People people are aware of it.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.920
Dell doing Linux computers is a thing now.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.760
Now, do you remember around this time?

11:16.400 --> 11:20.880
So while we were going, you had to like backfill coverage in the show.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.400
Oh, yeah, that's right.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.000
That is absolutely how is that?

11:24.000 --> 11:24.800
How did that go for you?

11:24.800 --> 11:28.240
Like, because I remember while we were gone, I think you did a show with Joe from.

11:28.240 --> 11:28.880
I did.

11:28.880 --> 11:29.440
Yeah.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.920
And I think maybe a code of radio somewhere in there, too.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.880
Well, how do you feel like that particular aspect of it all went good?

11:34.880 --> 11:36.400
Do you feel like we could improve?

11:36.400 --> 11:39.040
I mean, you're the you were the one in the in the middle of it all.

11:39.040 --> 11:43.360
Well, I think I think well, overall, we could definitely stand to improve.

11:44.320 --> 11:49.760
But there's a certain aspect of just kind of being thrown in, figuring it out.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.480
I really I guess I really enjoyed working with Joe.

11:52.480 --> 11:56.240
You know, he's obviously a fantastic friend of this here this here network.

11:56.240 --> 12:02.160
He's a he's a not only is Joe a great like on air talent, but Joe's really good at like

12:02.160 --> 12:04.960
the back end, like producing to get it all lined up.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.320
And so, yeah, that's it's always nice working with Joe because he's always got all his ducks

12:08.320 --> 12:08.880
lined up.

12:08.880 --> 12:12.400
And it was really interesting for me to just having seen a small subset of the stuff here,

12:12.400 --> 12:15.280
obviously watching a lot of the shows, but getting to participate more in the back end

12:15.280 --> 12:17.520
and understand like, what are the different constraints here?

12:17.520 --> 12:20.960
Because I my whole worldview was kind of skewed through up for a long time.

12:20.960 --> 12:24.240
So looking at it from a different perspective, it's been it's been really, really helpful.

12:24.240 --> 12:28.240
You know what else is going on in the background while you and Joe were doing a show and no

12:28.240 --> 12:31.680
one I are down in Texas at in Austin, Texas.

12:32.640 --> 12:36.800
There was also kill disk, which I don't know if you guys remember, but it was it was the

12:36.800 --> 12:40.880
first really popular ransomware that actually went after Linux users.

12:40.880 --> 12:41.360
Right.

12:41.360 --> 12:46.880
And it had a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar U.S. greenback ransom, but it will

12:47.440 --> 12:49.360
not decrypt your files even when you pay it.

12:49.360 --> 12:54.960
Oh, and at the time there was speculation like, oh, is this Linux's moment?

12:54.960 --> 12:59.840
Are we going to go after Samba servers and NFS servers and desktop Linux users with ransomware?

12:59.840 --> 13:01.280
Oh, man, it's finally here.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.240
Kill disk.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.080
And then that was basically it.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.600
And we talked about it ever again.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.200
No, it didn't go anywhere.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.400
Thankfully, very much.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.360
Thankfully.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.240
So kill disk.

13:10.240 --> 13:10.560
Wow.

13:11.040 --> 13:15.600
You know, there are so many things that have come up over the year as we wrap up the year.

13:15.600 --> 13:19.520
The Intel management engine is a continuing story.

13:20.880 --> 13:29.200
But if you had to give it to one story in just like the desktop Linux unplugged space.

13:31.200 --> 13:35.280
I mean, you'd have to say it's canonical dropping Unity and switching.

13:35.280 --> 13:35.840
It really has to be.

13:35.840 --> 13:36.640
Yeah, right.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.080
Hundred percent, hundred percent.

13:38.080 --> 13:38.800
It was huge.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.920
And that was back.

13:39.920 --> 13:44.800
The actual announcement hit us while we were in a conference room with the people at Dell

13:44.800 --> 13:46.560
that were shipping Ubuntu laptops.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.200
Wow.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.120
It could have been crazier timing.

13:49.120 --> 13:56.000
And so it was April 11th, episode 192 of the unplugged program, where we just took a huge

13:56.000 --> 14:02.800
section of the show when I got back from Texas and Noah joined us and the three of us with

14:02.800 --> 14:06.640
the mumble room just went through like, what does this mean?

14:06.640 --> 14:08.160
What is going on?

14:08.160 --> 14:09.360
And that's all in 192.

14:10.080 --> 14:14.000
And then it was a it was a six month build up to the 1710 release.

14:16.640 --> 14:19.920
And and it was it was weird.

14:19.920 --> 14:24.560
It was we didn't know exactly how far canonical was going to go with their customization of

14:24.560 --> 14:25.680
their Ubuntu version.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.040
Were they just going to ship stock?

14:27.040 --> 14:29.760
Gnome was marked done with the community.

14:29.760 --> 14:31.760
You couldn't tell what their motivations were.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.560
Like, are they in the desktop game at all anymore?

14:34.560 --> 14:36.160
Or are they just a cloud company?

14:36.160 --> 14:41.120
And then and the commentary ran the whole spectrum from this is canonical, ejecting

14:41.120 --> 14:44.640
the desktop to canonical is going to be more involved than ever before.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.800
And it just ran the whole damn spectrum.

14:46.800 --> 14:56.160
And it all sort of I just I saw a lot of like 80 20 to of the a bunch who no longer cares

14:56.160 --> 14:59.680
about the desktop to 20 percent of oh, this is where how they're going to rejuvenate

14:59.680 --> 15:00.720
the Linux desktop.

15:00.720 --> 15:05.120
We do the we we tend to go the doom and gloom route these days.

15:05.120 --> 15:08.000
They just you know, I think people are getting a little bitter.

15:08.880 --> 15:11.520
We're used to companies announcing now we're dropping the Linux version.

15:11.520 --> 15:12.960
Ah, screw Linux users.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.000
Oh, I can't make any money.

15:14.000 --> 15:20.240
I you know, and it's a neglected third operating system not to not to make this about Red Hat.

15:20.240 --> 15:24.480
But if you think about it, it kind of does start when Red Hat announced they were done

15:24.480 --> 15:27.840
making a desktop distro and they were going to have this fedora thing.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.480
And some of us were like, awesome fedora.

15:30.480 --> 15:33.280
It's like the leading edge of the enterprise version.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.560
Like, I'm going to stay ahead of the trend.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.520
This is great.

15:35.520 --> 15:40.240
And then other people were like Red Hat no longer cares about the desktop and kills their

15:40.240 --> 15:41.440
desktop version.

15:41.440 --> 15:47.200
And that really, if you think about it, has set the tone for all of the future conversations

15:48.080 --> 15:49.200
in a in a weird way.

15:49.200 --> 15:53.520
It seems to me and there are a lot of parallels there in terms of corporate strategy and.

15:55.600 --> 16:00.000
Go ahead, but it is well, it's just it is weird because if you if you go to Red Hat,

16:00.000 --> 16:06.720
there's probably more people in Red Hat using their own than most other advocates of linear

16:06.720 --> 16:12.000
and not canonical necessarily, but a lot of other I know a plenty of other projects where

16:12.000 --> 16:15.520
you go and then a lot of the people they're not using their own distro full time.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.360
Yeah, yeah.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.200
And and one of the ways I got started in Linux way, way, way back in the day before I even

16:23.200 --> 16:27.760
realized what Linux was, was a family member who was a Microsoft employee giving me a rack

16:27.760 --> 16:29.200
of Red Hat CDs.

16:29.200 --> 16:29.760
Really?

16:29.760 --> 16:30.400
Yeah, here you go.

16:30.400 --> 16:33.280
And it was one of these like four quad fold or trifold.

16:33.280 --> 16:38.320
I don't remember how many folds it had had multiple folds of CDs in like the little slots.

16:38.320 --> 16:39.360
A hefty little package.

16:39.360 --> 16:39.920
Yeah, yeah.

16:39.920 --> 16:44.160
And then you were supposed to go through all six tests as you install this thing because

16:44.160 --> 16:45.840
there was no online repo.

16:45.840 --> 16:46.960
Sounds worse than Gentoo.

16:48.880 --> 16:55.520
It was it was it was a different time because there was this sort of like it was there was

16:55.520 --> 17:01.280
sort of this new world that when Red Hat first emerged that seemed like an impossibility

17:01.280 --> 17:06.320
that Red Hat was going to come along and tame this crazy GPL software and ship an enterprise

17:06.320 --> 17:13.840
product was honestly it was I used to work with these mainframe guys and they told jokes

17:13.840 --> 17:15.360
about like it was such a joke.

17:15.360 --> 17:19.840
They would say you're going to install your Red Hat on your Mattel processors and pretend

17:19.840 --> 17:24.480
like it's a real PC like they would they would ridicule me about it.

17:24.480 --> 17:27.840
And now you look at it and they're a multi-billion dollar company.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.200
It gobbled up the whole world.

17:29.200 --> 17:33.280
And Canonical is racing towards an IPO with their server side.

17:33.280 --> 17:37.600
It really has the whole thing is the whole thing has really shifted from when I first

17:37.600 --> 17:40.000
got that like that that trifold or that quad fold.

17:40.800 --> 17:44.960
But it does seem like a lot of the conversations that we've had the proto conversation was

17:44.960 --> 17:45.840
when Red Hat.

17:45.840 --> 17:46.640
Is it the same Linux?

17:46.640 --> 17:47.140
Killed it.

17:49.520 --> 17:50.020
Hmm.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.880
No, I don't think so.

17:52.880 --> 17:54.480
I don't think so.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.080
It was a simpler Linux back then.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.040
It was a more innocent Linux.

17:59.040 --> 18:03.520
It was I could wrap my head around Linux in a different way back then than I can now more

18:03.520 --> 18:09.680
fully right now that I not that Linux hasn't exceeded my ability to comprehend it yet.

18:10.240 --> 18:16.400
But system D was like the first time like I had I had a choice like Chris you're going

18:16.400 --> 18:19.920
to learn system D or you're never going to understand this part of Linux.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.920
Like I had a choice to make there.

18:21.920 --> 18:24.000
And so it got close.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
And so I totally understand why people resent system D to a degree because it takes something

18:28.000 --> 18:32.880
that you could conceptualize and visualize in your head in its totality and adds a black

18:32.880 --> 18:33.840
box aspect to it.

18:33.840 --> 18:34.000
Yeah.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.760
Like when you write bash scripts all day.

18:35.760 --> 18:36.160
You know.

18:36.160 --> 18:36.320
Yeah.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.120
What do you think though?

18:37.120 --> 18:37.680
Is it different?

18:37.680 --> 18:38.720
Is it a different Linux now?

18:39.920 --> 18:41.760
I think it is for a number of reasons.

18:41.760 --> 18:45.520
But as it relates specifically to system D, what I have found because this discussion

18:45.520 --> 18:48.400
comes up at basically every conference, basically any group.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.120
Yeah, there's somebody that was and here's here's what I found.

18:51.120 --> 18:55.200
The people that really love to dig into system D ask them one question.

18:55.840 --> 18:58.960
Have you ever used it in a large scale enterprise environment?

18:58.960 --> 19:02.480
And the answer every single time is no.

19:02.480 --> 19:07.600
Because if they had, they would understand what the benefit if you're just talking about

19:07.600 --> 19:11.920
home or on your desktop or even five or 10 servers, nobody cares and you won't see a

19:11.920 --> 19:13.040
huge benefit to it.

19:13.040 --> 19:18.880
It's when you have a large cluster of servers or you're working with the medical institution

19:18.880 --> 19:23.200
and that you've got somebody leaning on the back of your chair, swearing at you, asking

19:23.200 --> 19:27.200
you how long it's going to be before this thing comes back up and you've gone from minutes

19:27.200 --> 19:29.520
of boot time to seconds of boot time.

19:29.520 --> 19:30.560
That's when it matters.

19:30.560 --> 19:34.160
And if you haven't seen that and if you haven't experienced it, no wonder you don't get it.

19:34.160 --> 19:35.040
Yeah, absolutely.

19:35.040 --> 19:38.160
Or like from my experience, I've worked a lot with people in like operation centers who

19:38.160 --> 19:41.920
have to go to a server they've never seen before, try to find out the status of a system.

19:41.920 --> 19:45.200
Well, good luck with the old style sys5 system.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.280
Did they implement a status command on your service?

19:47.280 --> 19:47.840
Who knows?

19:47.840 --> 19:48.960
But systemd is right there.

19:48.960 --> 19:51.680
You've got the top of the logs all in that.

19:51.680 --> 19:52.320
It's really nice.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.200
I do.

19:53.200 --> 19:58.160
I do like the fact now that there's a standardized way to get status and like I get the PID

19:58.160 --> 19:59.200
information.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.160
I appreciate all of that.

20:00.160 --> 20:03.920
You can even add like doc strings to it and just like a whole bunch of info.

20:04.480 --> 20:09.840
The number one thing I hear from the audience is, hey, I'm kind of new to Linux and unit

20:09.840 --> 20:14.160
files on systemd make way more sense to me than anything I've ever seen before.

20:14.160 --> 20:19.200
And so when we're bringing on new users, new admins, new sysadmins, I know that's something

20:19.200 --> 20:21.440
that has resonated well with them.

20:21.440 --> 20:28.480
But for me, the bigger picture item is a truly standardized syntax across all the distros

20:29.040 --> 20:36.240
that to me, that was the most valuable thing because like a dummy, I ran for a period of

20:36.240 --> 20:41.120
time Debian and Gentoo and SUSE Enterprise all in production.

20:41.120 --> 20:44.560
And there was very little commonality back then across all of those.

20:44.560 --> 20:47.600
So you learned all three different methods to just do the same stuff.

20:47.600 --> 20:47.840
Oh, man.

20:47.840 --> 20:52.000
Different package managers, different status commands, different names for all the packages,

20:52.000 --> 20:53.920
different syntax for the init scripts.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.080
Everything was different across the board.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.720
It was all on me to manage it.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.960
And it was all fine for Chris.

21:00.960 --> 21:08.400
And then if you go figure, auditors came along and said, excuse me, your IT guy is a maniac

21:08.400 --> 21:11.280
and deployed three different Linux distributions.

21:11.920 --> 21:14.320
And that's not maintainable.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.360
So you better standardize on Red Hat Enterprise Linux or fire that guy.

21:18.960 --> 21:19.440
Yikes.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.080
Yeah.

21:20.080 --> 21:27.680
So systemd offers like to me, it offers something that Chris in a very, very, very difficult

21:27.680 --> 21:31.200
situation a decade ago could have really used.

21:31.200 --> 21:36.000
If I could have come and said, well, look, my maintenance scripts all use SSH and systemd

21:36.000 --> 21:38.880
commands or whatever, there's not really an issue here.

21:38.880 --> 21:44.400
Like if I could have demonstrated commonality across the platforms, I could have nullified

21:44.400 --> 21:45.200
their argument.

21:45.200 --> 21:49.920
But because they had a completely accurate technical argument and management argument,

21:49.920 --> 21:52.000
I had nowhere to go.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.360
I had to get rid of all the Gentoo.

21:53.360 --> 21:55.920
That's what forced me to get rid of all of my Gentoo.

21:56.560 --> 21:56.880
Wow.

21:57.600 --> 21:58.480
Yeah, it really speaks to that.

21:59.680 --> 22:02.320
One of the things we love about Linux is there's so much choice.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.480
There's so many different forks and all kinds of things.

22:04.480 --> 22:08.320
Where is that a value add or where does it just create an extra work for us?

22:08.960 --> 22:18.080
Yeah, I suppose in a lot of ways, canonical moving back to Gnome has added a standard

22:18.080 --> 22:19.520
to the Linux desktop.

22:19.520 --> 22:21.040
It's not great for plasma lovers.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.760
It's not great for the Qt platform.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.560
But it is really great for the enterprise platform.

22:26.560 --> 22:32.960
Gnome, GTK, and if I target flat packs or I target snap packages, I can nail all of

22:32.960 --> 22:34.320
these distributions now.

22:34.320 --> 22:41.200
From SUSE to Debian to Ubuntu to Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS, it's all targetable now.

22:41.920 --> 22:48.560
The Gnome platform from 320 on has now become a target.

22:48.560 --> 22:51.360
And you can write applications to Gnome 320 and later.

22:51.360 --> 22:55.040
For how long have we been wanting to be able to have one story to tell outside developers?

22:55.040 --> 22:56.320
Like, look, you can target Linux.

22:56.320 --> 22:59.760
And 2017 was a really good year for the Builder project, for Gnome Builder.

22:59.760 --> 23:04.800
So there's a tool set, there's a distribution mechanism, and there's a common API now with

23:04.800 --> 23:06.240
Gnome 320 and beyond.

23:06.240 --> 23:11.120
And canonical being in that is a very good thing for the corporate desktop.

23:11.120 --> 23:14.000
I don't know if it's great for the home user, but it's great for the corporate desktop.

23:15.040 --> 23:16.640
How have your clients taken to it?

23:17.920 --> 23:19.440
Yeah, so I'll get to that in one second.

23:20.720 --> 23:26.000
I would argue that what is good for the corporate user is ultimately, in 99% of cases, good

23:26.000 --> 23:26.720
for the home user.

23:26.720 --> 23:27.760
And here's why.

23:27.760 --> 23:33.680
Because the corporations have the checkbooks to develop and work out the kinks that bother

23:33.680 --> 23:34.320
them.

23:34.320 --> 23:41.200
And so if you can get a desktop environment that you're going to have large corporations

23:41.200 --> 23:44.960
using, they're not going to deal with LibreOffice crashing, for example, right?

23:44.960 --> 23:46.320
They're going to want that fixed.

23:46.320 --> 23:50.480
And so if you can get some of those bugs fixed, then that trickles down to the home user.

23:50.480 --> 23:52.160
How have my clients been working out?

23:52.880 --> 23:57.200
Fairly well, although there's very few of them that have really been affected by the

23:57.200 --> 24:02.800
change, mainly because we keep most of those users on the LTS.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.960
And I've recommended that people switch.

24:04.960 --> 24:07.680
And I say, this is the one exception when I wouldn't do that.

24:07.680 --> 24:11.680
And every time I've had that conversation, and they say, well, but for sure, we're going

24:11.680 --> 24:14.640
to have to end up re-upgrading in April when the LTS comes out.

24:14.640 --> 24:17.920
Of course, my answer is yes, because that's a responsible thing to do.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.040
Well, we're not going to do it.

24:19.040 --> 24:23.120
We're not going to upgrade all these machines now, only to come back and revisit it in four

24:23.120 --> 24:23.600
or five months.

24:23.600 --> 24:24.480
Sure, yeah, of course.

24:24.480 --> 24:27.360
So most of them haven't done it.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.360
Yeah, they haven't even had to deal with it yet.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.200
That's something we should keep in mind.

24:32.320 --> 24:33.200
It's going to be years.

24:33.200 --> 24:36.080
It's a big deal for us on the edge here, Linux users.

24:36.080 --> 24:40.960
But LTS users, people that are known as clients, it'll be years before they deal with this.

24:40.960 --> 24:42.240
How long is 16 supported?

24:42.960 --> 24:48.560
Before we wrap up talking about Ubuntu and the Switch and the 17.10 release, we've got

24:48.560 --> 24:50.080
to mention the trip to New York.

24:50.080 --> 24:57.920
We've got to mention that October 3, 2017, we got back from New York.

24:57.920 --> 25:03.680
So obviously, a big moment, a big moment for the show, a big moment for our understanding

25:03.680 --> 25:04.880
of Ubuntu.

25:04.880 --> 25:09.760
So I'll talk about that just as we, you know, I've got to tease it a little bit.

25:09.760 --> 25:10.960
But first, let me talk about Ting.

25:10.960 --> 25:13.360
Go to linux.ting.com.

25:13.360 --> 25:15.040
Ting is mobile that is done right.

25:15.040 --> 25:20.160
All of us sitting here on the show right now are Ting customers for one clear reason.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.280
You pay for what you use.

25:21.280 --> 25:25.120
And if you're savvy, even just a little bit, you can make it work in your advantage.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.680
The average Ting bill is $23 a month.

25:27.680 --> 25:33.760
Every time I tell people the way Ting works that are outside the US, they go, Chris, Chris,

25:34.480 --> 25:36.880
you know that that's just how it should work.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.320
That's just how we do it here.

25:38.320 --> 25:42.240
And they usually like the insert name of countries that is not the United States.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.720
Yeah, that's how Ting is.

25:44.720 --> 25:48.800
Ting is if you had to reboot the mobile industry and start over again, you get Ting.

25:48.800 --> 25:52.640
You pay for what you use nationwide coverage, no contracts, no determination fees.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.480
If you just want to use data, you just pay for data.

25:54.480 --> 25:58.480
If you just want to use text messages, get a few alerts from Nagios, you use text messages,

25:58.480 --> 26:00.000
pay for what you use.

26:00.000 --> 26:05.920
Like April, maybe I got I spent 18 bucks in May, maybe I spent 34 bucks in June 23.

26:05.920 --> 26:07.840
And then back in July, I'm back to 18 bucks.

26:07.840 --> 26:13.040
It's it is unbelievable how much money you will save in a two year contract period for

26:13.040 --> 26:16.160
me like being able to just tether whenever I need it, right?

26:16.160 --> 26:17.280
Because I'll just pay for the data.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.280
I'm not like sneaking around my ISP.

26:19.280 --> 26:20.240
I'm not doing anything like that.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.240
It's just we're like troubleshooting problems.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.840
Have someone plug their Android phone in.

26:23.840 --> 26:25.760
I can remote in over that done.

26:26.320 --> 26:27.360
Absolutely.

26:27.360 --> 26:37.280
Linux.ting.com no contract nationwide coverage pay for what you use CDMA and GSM Linux.ting.com.

26:37.280 --> 26:41.040
So this whole trip to New York was very exciting.

26:41.040 --> 26:43.120
I didn't know how the hell I was going to pull it off.

26:43.120 --> 26:46.240
I had heard rumors that it was coming, but I didn't know for sure.

26:46.240 --> 26:51.040
So I couldn't I couldn't like put it on a calendar and say I'm going to be gone during

26:51.040 --> 26:52.320
this time period.

26:52.320 --> 26:56.160
Everybody plan on this because I didn't really know when it was going to be until it got

26:56.160 --> 26:57.760
just about a month out.

26:57.760 --> 26:58.240
Life it does.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.000
Life's not that easy for us.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.080
And then and then I had to do the math.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.800
Do I drive the RV?

27:04.800 --> 27:06.640
Do I fly?

27:06.640 --> 27:08.000
Do I take his car?

27:08.000 --> 27:09.440
Do I take my truck?

27:09.440 --> 27:15.040
Do I go buy a camper van and move into the camper van and then take the camper van to

27:15.040 --> 27:17.440
New York and sleep on the streets of New York?

27:17.440 --> 27:19.360
All of these things were considered.

27:19.360 --> 27:24.560
And what I ended up with was driving his car, which gets about 35 miles to the gallon, which

27:24.560 --> 27:25.920
is pretty good here in the states.

27:25.920 --> 27:32.400
And that turned out to be the cheapest way because I had the RV, which gets around six

27:32.400 --> 27:39.040
to eight miles per gallon, the truck, which gets around 15 to 20 miles per gallon, or

27:39.040 --> 27:42.640
his car, which gets around 35 to 40 miles per gallon.

27:42.640 --> 27:48.880
And in each each one of these options, there was this huge savings of gas money.

27:48.880 --> 27:54.400
So the most expensive aspect of that New York trip was the hotel, which I think was like

27:54.400 --> 27:55.920
360 a night.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.480
So Noah and I decided to shack up together.

27:58.480 --> 28:02.880
So Noah and I decided to shack up together, always looking for an excuse.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.800
Here's where that camaraderie comes right back in here.

28:05.760 --> 28:09.040
So to be fair, first of all, I did like the very first.

28:09.040 --> 28:11.520
Well, I think the very first thing I said was, yeah, that'd be really fun.

28:11.520 --> 28:11.920
Let's do it.

28:11.920 --> 28:15.280
Then the second thing I said was New York is like the most insanely expensive city I've

28:15.280 --> 28:16.960
ever been to, and it's going to cost us a lot of money.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.080
We're both going to go broke.

28:18.080 --> 28:19.360
Yeah, that's true.

28:19.360 --> 28:20.080
That is true.

28:20.080 --> 28:20.560
I mean, that's why.

28:20.560 --> 28:24.000
So that's why I ended up driving because I just needed to save as much money as possible.

28:24.000 --> 28:32.560
And as I headed out and the news of my adventure sort of trickled out through the J.B.

28:32.560 --> 28:38.880
audience, people started emailing me offerings to like stay at their house, crash on their

28:38.880 --> 28:43.440
couch or even park the RV in their like driveway.

28:44.240 --> 28:49.120
And so as we got going, like it was like one email and then it was a couple of tweets and

28:49.120 --> 28:50.720
then it was a few telegrams.

28:50.720 --> 28:57.040
And then it was five, five, ten, fifteen, thirty five emails offering me places to stay

28:57.040 --> 28:59.200
along my road, people watching the live tracker.

29:01.840 --> 29:07.520
I just you know, the audience is so awesome because that is the idea that I could have

29:07.520 --> 29:12.960
I could have probably taken the RV and just not even planned on a single place to stay

29:12.960 --> 29:17.120
and just had the safety net of the audience offering me places as I went along.

29:17.120 --> 29:21.600
It makes me think that maybe one day if I get a wild hair and I want to go off and do

29:21.600 --> 29:25.760
something just totally crazy, the audience would totally have my back.

29:25.760 --> 29:30.400
And as I'm going down the road, I'd be getting offers of places to stay because, you know,

29:30.400 --> 29:33.760
we've got offers at places I thought we had nobody listening.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.760
So I never even bothered asking.

29:35.760 --> 29:38.800
And I just got these invitations coming in constantly.

29:38.800 --> 29:39.360
I felt bad.

29:39.360 --> 29:42.880
I was telling people, no, people people like, please, we'll come over.

29:42.880 --> 29:43.840
We'll make you dinner.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.680
I'm like, that dude sounds amazing.

29:45.680 --> 29:49.600
Yeah, I'm like, one of these years and it needs to be soon.

29:49.600 --> 29:53.920
I just need to like go off on a road trip just to do that and take the microphone with

29:53.920 --> 29:54.400
me.

29:54.400 --> 29:59.760
But we got all the way to New York all the way, like literally on the other side of the

29:59.760 --> 30:00.240
country.

30:00.240 --> 30:03.120
We're still getting emails the entire time about offers of places to stay.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.720
We drive across the entire country.

30:04.720 --> 30:11.760
We get in New York and I didn't expect the the the I don't know what I expected.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.920
It's the it was the Grand Hyatt Hotel.

30:13.920 --> 30:16.560
And I guess I expected a parking garage.

30:16.560 --> 30:19.680
That's what I expected is I expected a parking garage.

30:19.680 --> 30:22.400
Now I understand there was a train station underneath the hotel.

30:22.400 --> 30:24.480
So there was no room for a parking garage.

30:24.480 --> 30:27.200
I did not have that knowledge before I arrived at New York.

30:27.200 --> 30:29.680
So I guess they thought I'd be arriving at a parking garage.

30:29.680 --> 30:36.640
So we spent a week living out of a compact Ford Focus.

30:36.640 --> 30:39.040
Production equipment, everything.

30:39.040 --> 30:40.240
Sounds roomy.

30:40.240 --> 30:47.040
A DC powered cooler, food, clothing, everything we needed was in this car.

30:47.600 --> 30:55.920
And we get to New York after a week of driving and it all came down to about 27 seconds.

30:56.720 --> 30:59.040
We we will we arrive at the Grand Hyatt.

31:00.320 --> 31:04.960
And you pull up and the valet, you know, you get out of the car and they welcome you and

31:04.960 --> 31:08.480
they grab your bag and they put you to the door and they say thank you.

31:08.480 --> 31:09.680
Here's the ticket for your car.

31:09.680 --> 31:11.520
And you go, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:11.520 --> 31:12.800
What if I need something out of my car?

31:13.680 --> 31:16.640
Well, you just you just you just go in there and you just tell the desk that you need a

31:16.640 --> 31:16.960
car.

31:16.960 --> 31:19.360
You need your car back and we'll bring you whatever you need.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.640
Oh, so I can just get whatever I need whenever I need it.

31:22.640 --> 31:25.600
Yeah, you just go in there, you tell the bellhop you need your car and they'll they'll call

31:25.600 --> 31:27.200
up the car service and they'll bring you your car.

31:28.640 --> 31:30.160
OK, yeah, well, I got my bag.

31:30.160 --> 31:31.360
I grabbed my laptop.

31:31.360 --> 31:36.000
You know, Hadia grabbed one of her bags, didn't grab her insulin kit or anything like that.

31:36.000 --> 31:36.800
And they took the car.

31:36.800 --> 31:39.280
And then we get in and we get up to our room and we're like, well, we should probably grab

31:39.280 --> 31:42.480
your insulin so that way you can, you know, not die.

31:42.480 --> 31:45.760
And I could, you know, maybe use my toothbrush.

31:45.760 --> 31:48.480
So we go down to the bellhop and we're like, yeah, we'd like to get our cars that way we

31:48.480 --> 31:49.040
can unload it.

31:49.920 --> 31:55.840
OK, well, you know, that's seventy five dollars every time we bring your car out and you're

31:55.840 --> 31:58.320
probably going to want to and then like this is like over five minutes.

31:58.320 --> 32:01.840
He also says you're probably going to want to tip these guys, too, because they hate

32:01.840 --> 32:02.720
doing this.

32:02.720 --> 32:07.360
So I would tip them pretty good and there's a seventy five dollar charge every time we

32:07.360 --> 32:08.800
want to every time you bring your car out.

32:10.560 --> 32:11.120
Wow.

32:11.120 --> 32:15.360
And that was when I was like, oh, man, I was not prepared for New York.

32:15.360 --> 32:18.960
That was like the most like, oh, shit.

32:18.960 --> 32:22.480
It used to be called nickel and diming, but these days it's larger bills.

32:22.480 --> 32:25.440
I was really glad I had grabbed all the recording gear.

32:25.440 --> 32:25.920
Right.

32:25.920 --> 32:28.480
It's like I had that so long.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.240
Hadia, I'm going to make some podcasts.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.960
Will you wither away?

32:32.960 --> 32:37.840
She eventually she eventually used the live tracker to hunt the car down herself.

32:37.840 --> 32:38.320
Really?

32:38.320 --> 32:38.560
Yeah.

32:39.360 --> 32:43.760
She got to where the car was at and got into it and told her, hey, I need my insulin and

32:43.760 --> 32:46.960
like grabbed a few other things and took off.

32:46.960 --> 32:53.520
But it was really interesting to watch how canonical works to go inside a company for

32:53.520 --> 32:54.400
a little bit.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.520
A company that we talk so much about, but really from the outside.

32:57.520 --> 33:00.320
I walked away with a lot of insights.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.080
I don't know.

33:02.080 --> 33:05.280
Any of them stand out to, you know, about, you know, when you go inside, like you've

33:05.280 --> 33:09.440
gone inside Red Hat now, we've gone inside Dell and we went inside canonical this year.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.160
So a lot of different inner workings.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.200
Does anything stand out at you?

33:14.560 --> 33:19.680
I guess the thing that stood out to me the most was how laid back everyone was.

33:19.680 --> 33:24.480
Like, if you think about look at the workshops that we were sitting in, right?

33:24.480 --> 33:28.640
Like these people are there, they're paying atrocious amount of money to be at this hotel.

33:31.200 --> 33:32.640
We split it, thankfully.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.720
And it was still over a thousand dollars.

33:36.160 --> 33:36.400
Yeah.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.400
But you think about this.

33:38.400 --> 33:43.600
So you and I, two yahoos walk in there with some cameras and, you know, people like Martin

33:43.600 --> 33:45.280
Wimperis, they just stop what they're doing.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.640
Hey, meet Chris and Noah.

33:46.640 --> 33:48.240
Hey, these are guys from JB.

33:48.240 --> 33:50.320
They're here to, you know, hang out and whatever.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.360
Well, is there anything we can shoot?

33:51.360 --> 33:52.400
No, shoot whatever you want.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.280
You're welcome here.

33:53.280 --> 33:58.000
And then, you know, we sit down and obviously I got a chance to, I got pretty close to Neil

33:58.000 --> 34:01.760
Gomba, who was one of the fedora guys that was there that was working with the development

34:01.760 --> 34:02.240
team.

34:02.240 --> 34:05.680
And so, you know, he would sit down and I'm like, yeah, I don't really understand development.

34:05.680 --> 34:09.040
So he'd walk me through at a very elementary level, what they were doing and stuff like

34:09.040 --> 34:09.540
that.

34:10.080 --> 34:15.440
And the fact that they are not only comfortable, but encouraged to do that.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.680
It was really interesting.

34:17.680 --> 34:23.280
You can see how you can hire a lot of really smart people and how they can get a lot of

34:23.280 --> 34:27.040
really great work done working under those kind of, under that environment.

34:27.920 --> 34:32.320
Yeah, the other thing that really struck me about it is you hear a lot of people debating,

34:32.320 --> 34:34.320
is it possible to get remote work done?

34:34.320 --> 34:36.240
Can you have a remote workforce?

34:36.240 --> 34:39.360
Is this a thing that could even be possibly accomplished?

34:40.240 --> 34:44.640
Three years ago, there was huge news when Yahoo announced that all remote workers were

34:44.640 --> 34:45.140
coming.

34:45.140 --> 34:45.680
Oh, yeah.

34:45.680 --> 34:46.180
Right.

34:46.180 --> 34:47.300
Right.

34:47.300 --> 34:51.620
Canonical is a company that was launched post-internet.

34:51.620 --> 34:55.060
And so it's just an assume that with a lot of these different tools, you can just work

34:55.060 --> 34:56.580
remotely and then you have get togethers.

34:57.860 --> 35:02.500
So what you see when you go to this event is a company built around the concept of we

35:02.500 --> 35:04.180
don't need to be region specific.

35:04.180 --> 35:05.700
For some jobs, we do.

35:05.700 --> 35:08.580
But for other jobs, we can just grab the best talent all over the world.

35:08.580 --> 35:11.540
Especially when you have this like open source pool, you have people who are interested from

35:11.540 --> 35:13.380
other regions, you need some flexibility.

35:13.380 --> 35:27.220
Yeah, and I don't want to ruin everybody's holiday spirit, but there is an awkward element

35:27.220 --> 35:27.940
to this.

35:27.940 --> 35:30.100
And they really handle it with grace.

35:30.660 --> 35:36.180
And it is you have a bunch of different cultures all coming into one space.

35:37.380 --> 35:41.700
Some people, a good portion of them are not even native English speakers.

35:41.700 --> 35:42.180
Sure.

35:42.180 --> 35:43.860
And they all come together.

35:43.860 --> 35:48.740
And all of that doesn't matter because this sounds so corny, but it's really true.

35:48.740 --> 35:50.580
And it's actually how it feels like at Fest too.

35:51.540 --> 35:55.620
All of that doesn't matter because it's the Linux and the open source stuff that matters.

35:55.620 --> 35:59.300
And they're so busy debating all of the nerdy aspects.

35:59.300 --> 36:00.340
That drive is there.

36:00.340 --> 36:03.940
The stuff that we talk about every single week, they're all having that conversation

36:03.940 --> 36:04.180
there.

36:04.180 --> 36:05.940
And that's what they talk, that's what they care about.

36:05.940 --> 36:09.060
They don't care about somebody that might have a disability.

36:09.060 --> 36:10.900
They don't care about somebody that doesn't speak English.

36:10.900 --> 36:14.900
Like what they care about is the conversations that we all have here.

36:14.900 --> 36:20.100
And so it's really interesting because that adds like an immediate commonality to everybody

36:20.100 --> 36:21.380
who doesn't normally work together.

36:22.260 --> 36:26.100
And it kind of makes that whole remote, everybody's remote, and then we come together every now

36:26.100 --> 36:26.660
and then.

36:26.660 --> 36:30.900
It kind of makes it all click because not only have you had a bunch of online conversations,

36:30.900 --> 36:35.220
but you have this common ground that you can immediately have a discussion about.

36:35.220 --> 36:38.980
So I think it really works for Canonical in a way it might not work for some other companies.

36:38.980 --> 36:40.420
That's my theory at least.

36:40.420 --> 36:44.420
Because I haven't really seen it, I mean, I think it's an underplayed aspect of Canonical

36:44.420 --> 36:46.500
because I haven't really seen a lot of other companies pull it off.

36:48.020 --> 36:48.740
It was cool to see it.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.260
I think there's other companies that do it.

36:50.260 --> 36:54.340
I think they're just, size comparison wise, I think you might be onto something.

36:54.340 --> 36:57.780
Like, you know, if you look at like, obviously Google has tons of people that work remotely.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.940
Red Hat, they don't care if you work remotely or not.

37:00.660 --> 37:01.700
So I think it's being done.

37:01.700 --> 37:05.540
But I think what's interesting about Canonical is the size and what they're able to do.

37:05.540 --> 37:11.060
Because, you know, they just got recently done pairing the entirety of their company down big time.

37:11.060 --> 37:11.620
Right.

37:11.620 --> 37:16.340
And hit the button, hit the button, we lost you, hit the button.

37:16.340 --> 37:20.500
Oh God, oh God, there you go, yeah, you're back, you're back.

37:20.500 --> 37:24.100
Yeah, but anyway, yeah, they have done a particularly good job, as you said,

37:24.100 --> 37:25.860
finding the best talent wherever they exist.

37:25.860 --> 37:30.180
Yeah, and I'll say this, the 1710 release ended up being pretty solid.

37:30.180 --> 37:33.060
Like that was the real rubber meets the road aspect to all of this.

37:33.060 --> 37:37.140
We could say all this stupid shit about it with a, you know, you can have your big blog post,

37:37.140 --> 37:40.740
you can have your big conversation, end of the desktop, their biggest investment ever.

37:40.740 --> 37:43.780
Like all of these people can have all of these different discussions.

37:43.780 --> 37:47.700
But the reality was the rubber met the road when 1710 shipped.

37:47.700 --> 37:48.660
Ship it or shut up.

37:48.660 --> 37:51.780
And we all looked at it and went, not only was that a pretty decent release,

37:51.780 --> 37:57.060
just in general, like stability and performance and bug fixes, but it was done the right way.

37:57.060 --> 37:59.380
It was polite light forks of the dock.

37:59.380 --> 38:03.380
It was a Gnome session implementation of their customization instead of just a whole bunch of

38:03.380 --> 38:05.620
extensions stacked on top of Gnome.

38:05.620 --> 38:09.540
Right, we haven't spent a whole bunch of time talking about all the drama between Ubuntu and Gnome.

38:09.540 --> 38:11.060
Like it just hasn't been a thing.

38:11.060 --> 38:16.500
No, now they're on the advisory board and they had a big banner up saying that Gnome loves Ubuntu.

38:16.500 --> 38:22.740
In some ways, like the best things that we had hoped for or speculated on way back when that was announced kind of came true.

38:22.740 --> 38:26.100
Okay, so I have a theory on the biggest loser of the year as a result.

38:26.100 --> 38:31.380
And loser is a harsh term because I just mean loser in terms of user exodus.

38:31.380 --> 38:33.220
So we'll get to that in just a moment.

38:33.220 --> 38:33.700
You ready?

38:33.700 --> 38:34.260
Are you guys with me?

38:34.260 --> 38:34.820
Well, I'm excited.

38:34.820 --> 38:36.420
Because you might disagree.

38:36.420 --> 38:37.460
You may disagree.

38:37.460 --> 38:38.260
Yeah, all right.

38:38.260 --> 38:41.460
So before we go there, let's talk about DigitalOcean.

38:41.460 --> 38:46.180
DigitalOcean.com, go over there and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

38:46.180 --> 38:47.860
It's one word, DOUNPLUGGED.

38:47.860 --> 38:54.420
You get a $10 credit, you spin up a droplet, you can install Linux, you can get working with something that really matters really fast.

38:54.420 --> 38:57.060
You ready to get off Dropbox, fire up Nextcloud.

38:57.060 --> 39:06.260
If you're out of family events and the whole family is looking for a way to share the photos from the event, maybe have a shared calendar for people's birthdays, why not spin up a Nextcloud instance?

39:06.260 --> 39:08.180
You also get file sync with that.

39:08.180 --> 39:22.740
If you're ready for a blog or something that's unique in yours, you could build it from scratch or you could deploy an entire stack with Ubuntu LTS, NGINX, a database and Ghost, which is an awesome Markdown based blogging platform that's really simple.

39:22.740 --> 39:29.460
And the nice thing about DigitalOcean is the price point, especially when you use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, means that you could just use it for an education.

39:29.460 --> 39:42.100
You could just use it to learn, get started with something, test, but their infrastructure with all SSDs, the dashboard, the API and data centers all over the world means you can put it in production and leave it in production.

39:42.100 --> 39:44.180
That's a really unique combination.

39:44.180 --> 39:52.500
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, get a $10 credit and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring this holiday edition.

39:52.500 --> 39:54.500
of the Unplugged program.

39:54.500 --> 40:00.500
So I think the biggest loser may be, and it hurts deeply for me to say this, Arch.

40:00.500 --> 40:02.500
I thought that's what you were going to say.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.500
Yeah, and do you agree?

40:04.500 --> 40:06.500
That is not what I thought you were going to say.

40:06.500 --> 40:10.500
Really? What did you think I was going to say? The biggest distro that lost out this year on users?

40:10.500 --> 40:12.500
I don't know, but that is just not the answer I was expecting.

40:12.500 --> 40:28.500
Well, you know, when I announced that I was going to switch to 16.04 and just sort of stabilize there, I mean, this is anecdotal information, but I probably heard from a hundred and something people who said, yeah, I'm doing the same thing.

40:28.500 --> 40:30.500
I've been running Arch for years.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.500
Some people even said I've been running it since your Arch challenge.

40:32.500 --> 40:34.500
And I love it.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.500
I love it too.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.500
The software availability can't be matched.

40:38.500 --> 40:48.500
And I, even before the show, Wes, we're talking about how whenever you use Discord, you're always using the web app version now because you're not keeping your Arch installation up to date enough for Discord to even work anymore.

40:48.500 --> 40:54.500
Because some of these packages, you've got to stay on top of it like a madman for it really to be a smooth Arch system.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.500
We're talking daily updates.

40:56.500 --> 40:58.500
And I was all on board with that for years.

40:58.500 --> 41:08.500
And then something slipped, and then it just slipped more, and it slipped more, and then it got two months, three months, and then that is really negligent Arch use.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.500
And that's when I realized, oh, I got to go to an LTS.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.500
Right.

41:12.500 --> 41:14.500
Well, and I think there may have been somewhat of an Arch bubble, right?

41:14.500 --> 41:18.500
And that it hit this time where like lots of people using Linux, you want that software.

41:18.500 --> 41:20.500
There's a lot of good software you can get.

41:20.500 --> 41:22.500
And there was, you know, flat, no snaps.

41:22.500 --> 41:24.500
They hadn't matured.

41:24.500 --> 41:26.500
Exactly.

41:26.500 --> 41:28.500
And that's not the problem anymore.

41:28.500 --> 41:30.500
So I think there will always remain this core Arch.

41:30.500 --> 41:34.500
I mean, I still want to put it on systems, especially systems that I really want a lot of control and understanding of the system.

41:34.500 --> 41:36.500
Because like, I mean, I use Ubuntu all the time.

41:36.500 --> 41:38.500
I use it at work.

41:38.500 --> 41:40.500
But it's a fatter OS than an Arch OS that you make for yourself, right?

41:40.500 --> 41:44.500
And it has some things that I don't agree with that are harder to change.

41:44.500 --> 41:52.500
But if all your goal is like run these three systems and do so in production, there's a lot of reasons not to use it.

41:52.500 --> 42:00.500
I don't know about you, Noah, but I have not installed a single Arch system since Ubuntu 17.10 came out.

42:00.500 --> 42:06.500
Oh, so really what it has come down for me is, and I've said this for years, this is nothing new.

42:06.500 --> 42:14.500
But I just don't believe personally that Arch has the same amount of polish that a distro like Ubuntu has.

42:14.500 --> 42:16.500
And what do you have?

42:16.500 --> 42:18.500
What does polish mean?

42:18.500 --> 42:22.500
I could disagree and call you a jerk, or I could totally agree, depending on your definition of polish.

42:22.500 --> 42:38.500
So when you look at Ubuntu with Unity, for example, you can tell that somebody, so one person or a group of people have sat down and gone left to right, top to bottom and said, what is this experience going to be like?

42:38.500 --> 42:44.500
And if when you get to Arch, obviously you install Arch, particularly with GNOME, because that's really the only experience I have.

42:44.500 --> 42:48.500
So you install Arch and you install GNOME. And the first thing that you sit down and go, this is terrible.

42:48.500 --> 42:52.500
And then the answer you get is, well, GNOME is designed to be extensible.

42:52.500 --> 42:56.500
So it's just kind of the core thing. And then you add the things that you want. Okay, so let's go with that.

42:56.500 --> 43:02.500
So you go out and you start installing extensions and you install a dock because you want a dock and you install this top icon thing because you want that and you try and do this.

43:02.500 --> 43:07.500
And then you find out that sometimes certain icons don't show up at the top.

43:07.500 --> 43:15.500
Sometimes they still go down to that bottom drawer thing and the dock doesn't really quite work because it kind of overlays over the website because it can't really tell where the web browser edge is.

43:15.500 --> 43:21.500
And then you go back and you complain to people and you say, but you told me to use this extension, this dock doesn't work.

43:21.500 --> 43:29.500
And then they say, well, yeah, I just kind of gave up on the dock. Well, you gave up on the dock because it sucks.

43:29.500 --> 43:45.500
If I was back on Ubuntu, not only does the dock work functionally properly and doesn't create five different telegram icons on the left hand side, it also it does little things like it changes the color of the transparency of the dock depending on what the underlying background is.

43:45.500 --> 43:47.500
Or progress bars.

43:47.500 --> 43:52.500
And yeah, right, right. It has a little progress bar underneath and the little dots to tell you which application is running.

43:52.500 --> 43:59.500
There's so many little things that Ubuntu has done because they have just beat and hammered this thing home.

43:59.500 --> 44:06.500
And no, it's not pretty and flashy and not much has changed from 1204 to 1610.

44:06.500 --> 44:11.500
But the little things have gotten just really, really clean.

44:11.500 --> 44:17.500
And I still have yet to find a Linux distribution that has the insane amount of multi monitor support that Unity has.

44:17.500 --> 44:22.500
And I was talking to you about this earlier before the show.

44:22.500 --> 44:29.500
I have a machine that's running Arch and I need it to run OBS and I go to open OBS and OBS just doesn't open up.

44:29.500 --> 44:40.500
That's just a frustrating thing as a computer user, because the reality is I know if I go to the Arch wiki or the AOR, I know that somebody has the answer in there and I have to roll back a package or install this or do that.

44:40.500 --> 44:42.500
But here's what I also know.

44:42.500 --> 44:49.500
If I had Ubuntu 1710 on there, I wouldn't be asking those questions. They would just work. It would just work. I'm 100% sure it would.

44:49.500 --> 44:54.500
So it all depends on what you want to do with the computer. Do you want to play with it? Is it a toy to you or is it a machine to get work done?

44:54.500 --> 45:17.500
So it seems like to me the ideal would be that Gnome 3 itself as an upstream project is so polished, is so well done, is so refined that when you install Arch or Fedora or SUSE or Bangero or whatever, or Solus and you chose Gnome 3 Shell as the desktop, you would just get this great refined experience.

45:17.500 --> 45:22.500
And then you have systemd underneath that and then you have the Linux kernel under that and you're good to go.

45:22.500 --> 45:33.500
Right, I think it speaks to that part of that polish and the advantages. You do have this company with like, we have an end goal in mind, whereas Arch is really maybe the best of, but an assemblance of open source software.

45:33.500 --> 45:34.500
You assemble it yourself.

45:34.500 --> 45:37.500
And so maybe part of the Ubuntu thing that's really good about this is you're right.

45:37.500 --> 45:44.500
Instead of having this weird Unity with a bunch of forked libraries that no one wants to bother to install on a different operating system, now we do have that in an upstream.

45:44.500 --> 45:57.500
I do agree with what Noah's saying though, man. When I logged into Unity 7, and I don't even remember, I think I started using Unity 7 more and more because that's what Noah put on the Skype machine.

45:57.500 --> 45:59.500
Oh yeah, right.

45:59.500 --> 46:07.500
Yeah, that's right. We were just trying out all the different, everything from Plasma to Mate to XFCE and Gnome 3.

46:07.500 --> 46:18.500
And each time we would hit these walls and be like, well shit, I can't use this now, fuck. And then the entire time this Unity 7 machine was just sitting here like a jerk, not doing anything wrong.

46:18.500 --> 46:22.500
And I thought, well, wait a minute, why aren't we talking about this?

46:22.500 --> 46:30.500
And so I tried out another system, it was great, because when I started to use it, I had that experience that Noah was talking about where it's like, oh shit, somebody really thought about this.

46:30.500 --> 46:45.500
They really gave some time, and they changed the way this thing behaves to make it better. And it's nice, but it is getting old. It is a limited time option.

46:45.500 --> 46:49.500
It's great right now, but in a year, in two years, in three years?

46:49.500 --> 46:59.500
I feel like I'm that polar bear on a melting ice cap right now, and I'm floating down the water. I'm like, I'm going to have to jump to another ice cap soon, but I probably have another year's worth of ice cap.

46:59.500 --> 47:02.500
And you know you're going to get wet and frigid cold in the process.

47:02.500 --> 47:13.500
And the problem is the ice really started melting. It's been kind of stagnant since 2012. The ice hasn't really grown at all since 2012, and so now we're just rapidly shrinking.

47:13.500 --> 47:22.500
But what gives me hope is if Canonical can put that much effort and get that kind of experience out of Unity that they're developing themselves,

47:22.500 --> 47:38.500
if we really believe what we always talk about on these shows about open source and open source development, there is no reason, absolutely no justifiable reason, why Gnome shouldn't be as good and exceedingly better because you have both Canonical and Red Hat working on the same thing.

47:38.500 --> 47:40.500
Yeah, right.

47:40.500 --> 47:44.500
Yeah, I hope. Maybe in 2019 that's what we'll be talking about.

47:44.500 --> 47:48.500
Maybe at the end of 2018 it'll be like, wow, how do we ever even exist without it being like this?

47:48.500 --> 47:59.500
In the meantime, I can't get past a spooky concept that is one of the reasons I'm not on Gnome if I'm being completely honest with you guys.

47:59.500 --> 48:12.500
If you look at what has been super successful in terms of desktop platforms, like the desktop that has persevered the longest, I think a lot of people would agree is Windows XP.

48:12.500 --> 48:13.500
Yeah.

48:13.500 --> 48:14.500
Oh, yes.

48:14.500 --> 48:17.500
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

48:17.500 --> 48:26.500
And now on the Linux side, it's going to be Unity 7 because you have this Unity 7 remix that's already in the works for 1804.

48:26.500 --> 48:31.500
You have people running 1604 that I'm hearing from over – I mean, think about it.

48:31.500 --> 48:36.500
If I'm getting over 100 emails about one topic, this can't be a small thing.

48:36.500 --> 48:37.500
Right.

48:37.500 --> 48:41.500
To me, I know it's an anecdotal thing, but to me that's a pretty big bellwether.

48:41.500 --> 48:50.500
And so you're going to have Unity 7 without the negative connotations is the XP of the Linux desktop.

48:50.500 --> 48:51.500
But what do we take –

48:51.500 --> 48:53.500
I'm trying to decide if I agree with that or not.

48:53.500 --> 48:54.500
What do we take away from that?

48:54.500 --> 48:57.500
What we take away from that is users like stability.

48:57.500 --> 48:59.500
They like to know where the gas pedal is at.

48:59.500 --> 49:02.500
They like it when the gas pedal remains in the same place for years.

49:02.500 --> 49:11.500
And developers like multiple years to work on something and iterate on something and ship something so they like super stable,

49:11.500 --> 49:17.500
super easy to target platforms like Windows and like Unity 7.

49:17.500 --> 49:23.500
There is a true user advantage to having something stay the same.

49:23.500 --> 49:25.500
Look at Mac OS.

49:25.500 --> 49:31.500
For all of the hype they get, it's been basically the same since the Mac OS.

49:31.500 --> 49:32.500
For like 10 years.

49:32.500 --> 49:33.500
Yeah.

49:33.500 --> 49:34.500
Right.

49:34.500 --> 49:41.500
And like we get really excited here on the show about new features, but Jane Doe out there doesn't care because you can still just open your window,

49:41.500 --> 49:43.500
go to Facebook and use your computer.

49:43.500 --> 49:45.500
What do you think, Noah?

49:45.500 --> 49:48.500
I think the best thing about Linux is that we can have both.

49:48.500 --> 49:55.500
I think that the people that want the latest and greatest thing, I think those people are more than welcome and able to stay on Arch.

49:55.500 --> 50:03.500
But what you're saying and I think the really important thing here that even the people that want to be on Arch have to understand is when Microsoft goes to package Skype,

50:03.500 --> 50:06.500
they don't sit down at the Grand Hyatt with a bunch of Arch users.

50:06.500 --> 50:11.500
They sit down with Canonical and have a conversation about how they can target snap packages.

50:11.500 --> 50:19.500
And if you can give Microsoft a here you go, target this particular thing, make this package and you'll get all of the Linux peoples.

50:19.500 --> 50:26.500
If you can make it that simple for them instead of, well, we're going to target Ubuntu, but that changes every five years.

50:26.500 --> 50:27.500
And then this happens.

50:27.500 --> 50:31.500
And then there's a lot of people that use Arch because they don't have this problem with Canonical and some people don't like Unity.

50:31.500 --> 50:32.500
So they're over Red Hat.

50:32.500 --> 50:33.500
Right.

50:33.500 --> 50:34.500
That just you get lost.

50:34.500 --> 50:35.500
And it just and no, forget it.

50:35.500 --> 50:36.500
We'll just not do Linux.

50:36.500 --> 50:37.500
That's a mess.

50:37.500 --> 50:38.500
We're not touching it.

50:38.500 --> 50:47.500
I think things like everyone with Ubuntu or Canonical agreeing on GNOME and I think with the advent of universal packages,

50:47.500 --> 50:51.500
I think we have a real shot at getting some some really great industry support.

50:51.500 --> 50:53.500
And that will trickle down to Arch.

50:53.500 --> 50:59.500
You know, those Arch guys are going to find a way to make anything that somebody targets for Ubuntu work on Arch.

50:59.500 --> 51:01.500
And if it snaps, it's a done deal.

51:01.500 --> 51:03.500
Yeah. You know how you know this is true.

51:03.500 --> 51:14.500
If you want another interesting example you could cite is there is a likely reason that Valve chose Ubuntu 1204 and not Manjaro Linux for their Steam runtime.

51:14.500 --> 51:15.500
You know, there's a reason there.

51:15.500 --> 51:22.500
There's a reason why they chose Debian for Steam OS and not something that's like Fedora.

51:22.500 --> 51:25.500
There is today as we record this.

51:25.500 --> 51:29.500
Well, I shouldn't say that, but this is going to date a little bit.

51:29.500 --> 51:31.500
I don't know if you guys saw this.

51:31.500 --> 51:32.500
You know what?

51:32.500 --> 51:33.500
Maybe we'll make this news.

51:33.500 --> 51:39.500
This is a little newsy, but there is a major company that just announced their own Linux distribution.

51:39.500 --> 51:41.500
And you guys know the company.

51:41.500 --> 51:43.500
I have not seen this bit of news.

51:43.500 --> 51:45.500
I guarantee you've never used their distribution.

51:45.500 --> 51:46.500
I'm betting.

51:46.500 --> 51:49.500
Actually, I can't guarantee it, but I'm betting because it's so new.

51:49.500 --> 51:51.500
I bet you've never used their Linux distribution.

51:51.500 --> 51:52.500
All right. Is that a good tease?

51:52.500 --> 51:53.500
I'm excited.

51:53.500 --> 51:54.500
A holiday tease, Wes.

51:54.500 --> 51:55.500
All right.

51:55.500 --> 51:56.500
You got me all excited.

51:56.500 --> 51:59.500
Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

51:59.500 --> 52:03.500
You go there, you support the show, and you sign up for a free seven day trial.

52:03.500 --> 52:06.500
This is a good chance to try out the Linux Academy platform.

52:06.500 --> 52:08.500
Bang it around a little bit.

52:08.500 --> 52:09.500
See what it can do.

52:09.500 --> 52:10.500
Download some of the guides.

52:10.500 --> 52:12.500
Listen to some of the study audio.

52:12.500 --> 52:16.500
It's like a podcast that you can listen to to teach you about Linux.

52:16.500 --> 52:19.500
Plus, they'll spin up virtual servers if you're ready to do that.

52:19.500 --> 52:22.500
And one of the things I love is you choose very early on.

52:22.500 --> 52:27.500
I want to base it all around Debian or Red Hat or Ubuntu.

52:27.500 --> 52:30.500
There's more than seven distros you can choose from.

52:30.500 --> 52:34.500
You choose the distribution, and then it will then modify the courseware.

52:34.500 --> 52:38.500
So all the syntax and all of the language matches the right distro.

52:38.500 --> 52:42.500
But behind the scenes, they also spin up the virtual servers on the backend

52:42.500 --> 52:46.500
as the courseware dictates, and they match the distro you've chosen.

52:46.500 --> 52:49.500
All these things that happen in the backend are all centered around that

52:49.500 --> 52:51.500
because they truly get Linux users.

52:51.500 --> 52:54.500
And they have human beings that are ready to help whenever you need it.

52:54.500 --> 52:58.500
They're constantly adding new courseware to make your subscription more valuable.

52:58.500 --> 53:01.500
And they have flashcards that are forked by a community.

53:01.500 --> 53:05.500
So there's new things that are being contributed there to help you study constantly.

53:05.500 --> 53:08.500
If you're going for certs, they've got courseware just for that.

53:08.500 --> 53:11.500
And if you just want to learn more, they've got a really good system

53:11.500 --> 53:15.500
where you can say how much time you've got, what you kind of want to go for,

53:15.500 --> 53:17.500
and they'll work around all of that.

53:17.500 --> 53:19.500
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

53:19.500 --> 53:21.500
Go there, sign up for a free seven-day trial,

53:21.500 --> 53:23.500
and a big thank you to Linux Academy.

53:23.500 --> 53:27.500
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

53:27.500 --> 53:30.500
You have a guess?

53:30.500 --> 53:32.500
I think you could guess this.

53:32.500 --> 53:34.500
I'll give you a hint. I'll give you a hint, Wes.

53:34.500 --> 53:35.500
It's a Seattle-based company.

53:35.500 --> 53:37.500
So I was going to say Amazon.

53:37.500 --> 53:41.500
Yeah, Amazon launched Amazon Linux 2.

53:41.500 --> 53:43.500
I was going to say, I was like, they already have one, so that's not new.

53:43.500 --> 53:49.500
So what they had before was their Linux AMI instance,

53:49.500 --> 53:52.500
which you could deploy on Amazon infrastructure.

53:52.500 --> 53:56.500
Amazon Linux 2 is based on Red Hat Enterprise 7.

53:56.500 --> 53:57.500
Hey, that's nice.

53:57.500 --> 53:59.500
And I actually have a copy of it running upstairs

53:59.500 --> 54:03.500
because they are distributing it for local on-premises deployment.

54:03.500 --> 54:06.500
VMs, Docker, they're not releasing in ISO.

54:06.500 --> 54:09.500
There's no website you go to download this.

54:09.500 --> 54:11.500
You can't go to the Amazon website and download an ISO

54:11.500 --> 54:13.500
and burn it to a thumb drive.

54:13.500 --> 54:14.500
That's not who this is for.

54:14.500 --> 54:17.500
No. You can go to Docker Hub and you can grab it.

54:17.500 --> 54:21.500
This is a new way for companies to distribute Linux.

54:21.500 --> 54:24.500
It is designed to run in a virtual environment

54:24.500 --> 54:26.500
for on-premises development.

54:26.500 --> 54:30.500
They're creating a VirtualBox, VMware, and a Hyper-V image.

54:30.500 --> 54:32.500
So you can build locally.

54:32.500 --> 54:34.500
You can run it in Docker or build on your VM,

54:34.500 --> 54:36.500
and then you can deploy up on EC2, obviously,

54:36.500 --> 54:39.500
using Amazon Linux 2.

54:39.500 --> 54:43.500
Now, it is quote-unquote based on Red Hat Enterprise 7,

54:43.500 --> 54:45.500
but I played around with it a little bit,

54:45.500 --> 54:49.500
and it is so basic, bitch, you can't do anything.

54:49.500 --> 54:52.500
Like, it doesn't even have PS, top, nothing.

54:52.500 --> 54:55.500
All of the repos are pointed at Amazon servers,

54:55.500 --> 54:57.500
so all of the updates, all of the packages,

54:57.500 --> 55:01.500
and then they have like an Amazon Linux Extras repository,

55:01.500 --> 55:04.500
which is going to have partner software,

55:04.500 --> 55:08.500
like current partner software, whatever that might be.

55:08.500 --> 55:10.500
That must be a feature, right, so that you can be like,

55:10.500 --> 55:12.500
hey, we're an Amazon partner, you can get the latest software

55:12.500 --> 55:13.500
if you're running the Amazon Linux.

55:13.500 --> 55:15.500
Yeah, and then the other thing they're doing

55:15.500 --> 55:18.500
is they're basing it around the Linux kernel 4.9,

55:18.500 --> 55:20.500
which is an LTS release,

55:20.500 --> 55:24.500
so this is going to be supported for five years.

55:24.500 --> 55:27.500
This is an Amazon version of CentOS that's been pared down

55:27.500 --> 55:31.500
with more up-to-date versions of GCC, bin utils,

55:31.500 --> 55:35.500
Node.js, Python, like a bunch of the stuff.

55:35.500 --> 55:37.500
It's making RHEL 7 relevant for right now.

55:37.500 --> 55:40.500
RHEL 7 with modern application libraries and whatnot.

55:40.500 --> 55:41.500
Interesting.

55:41.500 --> 55:44.500
Yeah, available for on-premises deployment.

55:44.500 --> 55:46.500
It's funny, too, because this is, like,

55:46.500 --> 55:48.500
out of the Linuxes out there,

55:48.500 --> 55:50.500
I'm sure Amazon Linux accounts for a huge number

55:50.500 --> 55:51.500
and we just don't ever talk about it.

55:51.500 --> 55:53.500
Oh, yeah, well, and think about this, too.

55:53.500 --> 55:55.500
Like, you're sitting in some big meeting,

55:55.500 --> 55:57.500
and you've got your CTO there and your CEO

55:57.500 --> 56:00.500
and your developers and your art people,

56:00.500 --> 56:02.500
and you're all talking about this big application you're building.

56:02.500 --> 56:05.500
I have been in these meetings, and you're like,

56:05.500 --> 56:06.500
well, we got to definitely, like, back then,

56:06.500 --> 56:08.500
it was we got to run it on the Facebook platform.

56:08.500 --> 56:09.500
This is how old I am.

56:09.500 --> 56:12.500
We got to make sure this application runs on the Facebook platform.

56:12.500 --> 56:14.500
But today, you'd probably be talking about

56:14.500 --> 56:15.500
how you're going to be a huge success

56:15.500 --> 56:16.500
and you got to be able to scale

56:16.500 --> 56:18.500
and you got to be able to meet demand,

56:18.500 --> 56:20.500
and so you got to deploy it on EC2.

56:20.500 --> 56:24.500
So you can now write your applications on your LAN

56:24.500 --> 56:29.500
running in, like, I have it on my stupid Linux box upstairs in Docker.

56:29.500 --> 56:31.500
I've got Amazon Linux running right now.

56:31.500 --> 56:33.500
I could write applications on that,

56:33.500 --> 56:35.500
and then when I'm ready to deploy to the world,

56:35.500 --> 56:38.500
I upload the whole damn thing to Amazon,

56:38.500 --> 56:41.500
and it's the same exact thing I was running on my local machine.

56:41.500 --> 56:43.500
I wonder how much of an impact, like,

56:43.500 --> 56:44.500
I wonder what Ubuntu feels about this,

56:44.500 --> 56:46.500
because that's one of their big selling points, right?

56:46.500 --> 56:48.500
It's like you can run this everywhere,

56:48.500 --> 56:50.500
and they want to have that huge cloud presence.

56:50.500 --> 56:51.500
Noah, picture yourself for a moment.

56:51.500 --> 56:53.500
Like, this is years down the road.

56:53.500 --> 56:54.500
This is actually not going to happen,

56:54.500 --> 56:56.500
but picture for a moment you're down the road,

56:56.500 --> 56:58.500
and you're like, yeah, we're going to install Amazon Linux for you,

56:58.500 --> 57:04.500
because it is a free Amazon-backed version of Red Hat Enterprise 7.

57:04.500 --> 57:05.500
There's no way.

57:05.500 --> 57:07.500
I'm not seeing this at all.

57:07.500 --> 57:09.500
So here, there's a number of problems I see with this.

57:09.500 --> 57:14.500
The first is the reason why Amazon AWS is as big as it is

57:14.500 --> 57:17.500
is because people were able to download Ubuntu,

57:17.500 --> 57:20.500
get comfortable with it, build applications in it,

57:20.500 --> 57:23.500
and then that was a really easy way.

57:23.500 --> 57:26.500
It was way easier back in the day to run Ubuntu in the cloud

57:26.500 --> 57:28.500
than it was to run a Microsoft Windows server,

57:28.500 --> 57:31.500
and that accounted, I think, for a huge number of people

57:31.500 --> 57:33.500
that came over to things like AWS.

57:33.500 --> 57:37.500
Right, but that was pre-containers.

57:37.500 --> 57:40.500
That was also pre-AWS dominance, right?

57:40.500 --> 57:41.500
Like, if you're a startup.

57:41.500 --> 57:43.500
I'm not disagreeing with you fully.

57:43.500 --> 57:44.500
I'm just playing devil's advocate.

57:44.500 --> 57:45.500
I mean, if you think about it, like,

57:45.500 --> 57:48.500
you think about it in the terms of I'm going to deploy an application,

57:48.500 --> 57:49.500
a container.

57:49.500 --> 57:51.500
This application is going to be a container,

57:51.500 --> 57:55.500
and I'm going to put it up online as a container.

57:55.500 --> 57:59.500
You don't want all of Ubuntu in there.

57:59.500 --> 58:04.500
Dent, but what is the advantage of taking on the overhead

58:04.500 --> 58:07.500
of maintaining a software distribution

58:07.500 --> 58:09.500
if you're just going to run the software in a container anyway?

58:09.500 --> 58:13.500
Like, containers run just fine on Ubuntu stock,

58:13.500 --> 58:15.500
and that's somebody else's headache.

58:15.500 --> 58:19.500
But you need a Linux inside the container environment.

58:19.500 --> 58:21.500
You need, like, a minimal Linux in the container.

58:21.500 --> 58:23.500
The container itself is also, right?

58:23.500 --> 58:24.500
What do you think, Gwyn, right?

58:24.500 --> 58:25.500
Yes, that's true.

58:25.500 --> 58:29.500
I mean, I will also say Ubuntu does have pared down,

58:29.500 --> 58:30.500
you know, cloud versions.

58:30.500 --> 58:32.500
I will also say that, like, the overhead, I think,

58:32.500 --> 58:34.500
to Amazon is just so negligible,

58:34.500 --> 58:36.500
and I think it's also interesting to think about, like,

58:36.500 --> 58:39.500
here's Amazon employing, like, they have people doing this.

58:39.500 --> 58:42.500
Like, there are people employed to develop this Linux version.

58:42.500 --> 58:43.500
Yeah, yeah.

58:43.500 --> 58:45.500
I do kind of follow what Noah's saying, though.

58:45.500 --> 58:47.500
It's, like, what makes Ubuntu popular?

58:47.500 --> 58:48.500
I'm talking about the advantages.

58:48.500 --> 58:50.500
Well, I think the advantage is it's, like, a target.

58:50.500 --> 58:52.500
Also lock-in.

58:52.500 --> 58:54.500
Well, for Amazon, that's the advantage.

58:54.500 --> 58:59.500
But the advantage for a developer is this is an Amazon-backed target,

58:59.500 --> 59:02.500
and if I write to this and then I deploy on EC2,

59:02.500 --> 59:04.500
I'm almost guaranteed to have a good time.

59:04.500 --> 59:05.500
Imagine there'll be a lot of documentation.

59:05.500 --> 59:06.500
Right, exactly.

59:06.500 --> 59:09.500
So what's the advantage to Amazon?

59:09.500 --> 59:12.500
Well, if you're already going to deploy on EC2,

59:12.500 --> 59:13.500
you see what I'm saying?

59:13.500 --> 59:15.500
Like, say you were, like, building an application

59:15.500 --> 59:18.500
with the intention to host it on EC2, which is common.

59:18.500 --> 59:19.500
Oh, yeah.

59:19.500 --> 59:21.500
Once you've, like, management decided we are an AWS shop,

59:21.500 --> 59:23.500
and that's where you're at.

59:23.500 --> 59:25.500
Yeah, we're not running our own servers.

59:25.500 --> 59:26.500
We're not building a data center.

59:26.500 --> 59:27.500
We're an AWS shop.

59:27.500 --> 59:28.500
Very few companies, less than they should,

59:28.500 --> 59:31.500
but, like, very few are doing both Google or Azure.

59:31.500 --> 59:34.500
Most of them are all in on AWS, which we have seen from time to time.

59:34.500 --> 59:36.500
We have all witnessed that from time to time.

59:36.500 --> 59:40.500
And so this, to me, seems like it's, like, an insurance policy.

59:40.500 --> 59:43.500
Think about it from a business predictability standpoint.

59:43.500 --> 59:48.500
This is the Amazon Linux, which is actually called that,

59:48.500 --> 59:54.500
the Amazon Linux, which I'm going to run on the Amazon infrastructure.

59:54.500 --> 59:56.500
There probably also are actual optimizations.

59:56.500 --> 59:58.500
Like, already there are extra packages, extra drivers

59:58.500 --> 01:00:00.500
that you install when you run on AWS.

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:01.500
This will come with those pre-shipped.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:03.500
They can tailor for their environment.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:06.500
And then you go one geek layer down, and you discover

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:10.500
it's actually based on Red Hat Enterprise 7,

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.500
which is also a super solid Linux.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.500
So, like, when you go down the stack, and then you go even further,

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.500
and you go, oh, well, and then on top of that,

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:21.500
it's based on the Linux kernel 4.9, which is an LTS release,

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:26.500
and it ships with modern versions of Python, Node.js, Ruby, PHP, et cetera.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.500
It seems like there's a lot of vertical integration.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.500
So it's like Red Hat Enterprise 7, backed by Amazon,

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:35.500
built for EC2 with modern backend packages.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:39.500
Jared, I guess I just keep hearing vendor lock-in.

01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.500
I guess that's what comes out to me.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.500
Yeah, 100%, yeah.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.500
But I feel like the reality is there are corporations now

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.500
that just, we decide we're a Google Apps company.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.500
We're an Amazon Web Services company.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.500
You and I, I don't know if you know who it is, Noah,

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:58.500
but you and I have a listener of Ask Noah and this program,

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:01.500
and their entire business, their entire desktops,

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.500
all are hosted on Amazon.

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.500
Like the management just said,

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:08.500
we're going to do the Amazon remote desktop system,

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.500
and everybody's just going to have a remote desktop powered by Amazon

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:15.500
here at our company, and that's the entire fleet.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.500
Huh, that's interesting.

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:20.500
Yeah, I guess I'm having a hard time seeing it,

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:24.500
but I understand conceptually what you guys are saying.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.500
I wouldn't want to do it.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.500
I wouldn't want JB to do it.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.500
I'm not saying it's a good idea.

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:35.500
But with the amount of developers that are going to be getting there,

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.500
because people don't start on AWS, right?

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.500
That's what the whole light sale thing was supposed to be about,

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:43.500
was to try to get people started, because there's a lot of people that,

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.500
like you said, unless they're already an AWS shop,

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:50.500
the guy who has an idea, that guy isn't on AWS.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.500
He's on DigitalOcean, or he's on Voltaire.

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.500
Or he's got a Ubuntu box or a Fedora box at home.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.500
Absolutely, spinning it up on his home.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.500
Or she, yeah.

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:05.500
So, we've just about gotten to a discussion about pronouns.

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:07.500
So then they...

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.500
That's what I was going to say.

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.500
If you're going to say she and he, then we'd better get in re and they and them.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:16.500
But anyway, so what you wind up with then is,

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:19.500
where is the start of this?

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.500
That only is going to apply to people that are starting with AWS.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:24.500
And maybe AWS has grown to the point that that's just the de facto standard now

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.500
for any large scale thing.

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.500
And so any company that's looking to host in the cloud is going to go,

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.500
well, you know what, I can just start with this light sale thing,

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:34.500
and if I need to scale, I can go from my $5 up to full on AWS.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.500
Maybe that's the thing.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.500
Like, I wonder how many times you're the person with the idea,

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:38.500
and then you go to get VC funding.

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.500
They're like, oh, you're on this DigitalOcean thing.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:43.500
You should probably build that on AWS, so we're not giving you the money.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:46.500
Or maybe, I mean, it feels like DigitalOcean is probably big enough.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:50.500
Any of your rack spaces, your DigitalOceans, they would probably be big enough.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.500
But like, oh, you've rolled your own infrastructure?

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.500
Yeah, no way we're funding that.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.500
That definitely feels like a thing.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:00.500
I mean, I don't have a lot of personal experience with that.

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:01.500
And they get you right.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.500
See, the other part about Amazon is they have all these managed services.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:05.500
So instead of like, you can be a guy with an idea,

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.500
instead of hiring a DBA, you're like, well, we'll just pay money

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.500
to have Amazon be our DBA.

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:14.500
There is a, from the conversations I've had with a lot of different listeners,

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:18.500
the situation they end up in is they need to get confidence

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:23.500
in either an investor or a CTO or somebody who says,

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.500
there's no way in hell that's going to work.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:28.500
And if you put a name on there, sometimes that name is IBM.

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.500
Sometimes that name is Microsoft.

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:33.500
And now more and more that name is Google or Amazon.

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.500
The name changes, but it's that same idea.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:37.500
Oh, God, if that isn't true.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:38.500
Yeah.

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:41.500
And when you put, yeah, well, we're going to be running this on Amazon's infrastructure.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:47.500
What that is shorthand for is we're going to be able to answer every web request,

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:50.500
everything's going to be fast, and it's going to stay up all the time,

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.500
and somebody else is going to manage all of the IT aspects.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:56.500
That's shorthand for we're running on EC2, it's not our problem.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:02.500
And that is predictable risk to investors and to companies and to small businesses,

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.500
and that's why it's appealing.

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:05.500
I'm not saying it's a good idea.

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.500
Right, whether or not that's true or makes sense for particular cases or not.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:11.500
Yeah, because all that could be true with just Ubuntu stock.

01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.500
All that could be true with...

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.500
100%.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.500
Yep.

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:18.500
Dude, if you had a great IT team that had been obviously rocking it for years,

01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:22.500
where you could even just like quoting tickets or bug fixes,

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:26.500
where you could say, look at our team, they're just crushing it for years and years and years,

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.500
it doesn't matter to these people.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:31.500
That's been my take, is there is value in the brand name.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:36.500
There's value in going with the trend, even if it doesn't ultimately work out,

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:39.500
which is a sick, perverse aspect of this industry.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.500
It's really kind of gross.

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:41.500
Well, we see it.

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.500
We see it in programming languages, we see it all over the place, right?

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:47.500
Whatever is hot now, if that's not what you're doing, you should not trust it.

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.500
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.500
I don't like it.

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.500
All right, well, let's talk about something positive.

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:56.500
Let's wrap this up on like a more positive aspect of it.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:01.500
So this year, I think, if I'm doing my math right, you and I will hit 250,

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:02.500
where we have a lot of things...

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:03.500
Oh, boy.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:06.500
We have a lot of things in store.

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:10.500
No, I know that when you and I were doing the last Linux action show,

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:14.500
I think you and I both agreed like we finally filmed last the way we would like to film it,

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.500
where we had a camera on Noah, we had a camera on me.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:21.500
We just sat back and we just did whatever the F we wanted to do,

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:24.500
and the cameras were just rolling.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:29.500
What's funny, if you go ask audience members, they will agree with this.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:35.500
The best episode was probably the least planned Linux action show we ever did,

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:36.500
at least you and I together.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.500
We ever did the least planned one.

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:41.500
We had like a general idea what we were going to talk about,

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.500
and you prepped the news stories, but that was it.

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:47.500
Then we sat down and the entire main segment, it was second to last.

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.500
I don't know if you remember this, but after we got done with the very last one,

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:54.500
we went back and said, man, we almost should have just called it at the second to last one,

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.500
because that was such a good episode.

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:57.500
I do remember.

01:05:57.500 --> 01:05:58.500
You're right.

01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:01.500
It was just that completely laid back, let's just have a discussion,

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:05.500
not necessarily unlike what we're doing today, and it wound up a great episode.

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:09.500
We're working on... I don't know if we'll get there.

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:12.500
250 may be too ambitious, because I want to crowdfund it.

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:16.500
I want to crowdfund it, if possible, because it's always been...

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:22.500
I always want to... this is... for me, I don't do this for the money.

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:26.500
I do it because I want to make content, and I want to have a connection with the audience,

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:33.500
and I just always feel like crowdfunding is sort of the third piece to that.

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:36.500
It's this ideal of it makes sense in the feedback.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:39.500
So I set 250 as sort of our goal to see if we could get there.

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:43.500
Put a couple of cameras in here, and you and I just hanging out.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.500
Today we're drinking... what is this?

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:49.500
I'm drinking a Black Butte porter from Deuces.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.500
And what are you drinking?

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:54.500
We also have Pray for Snow, a winter ale from Ten Barrel.

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:57.500
So we'll be sitting back, maybe drinking a beer, hanging out.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.500
It'd be a really nice behind-the-scenes kind of version,

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:02.500
not like the green screen, not with the studio lights.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:06.500
That's what we're trying to get with Linux unplugged and 250,

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:11.500
to keep the low-key audio show, but give people something to watch

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.500
if they're watching on their Kodi Vox.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.500
Feel closer to us.

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.500
They're watching on YouTube, something like that.

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:16.500
So that's kind of our goal.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.500
I'm kind of curious, Noah, if we could get a little preview

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:22.500
of where you've thought about Ask Noah going in the next year.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:24.500
I mean, I know you're moving to a new lifetime.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:25.500
You're going to be following up.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:26.500
Is that right?

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:27.500
Yeah, it's going to be us and then Noah.

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:31.500
So if you come in on Tuesdays, you're going to get up and ask Noah back-to-back.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.500
That's going to be killer, I think.

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.500
It's going to be like a Linux Tuesday.

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.500
So that's coming down the pipe for Ask Noah.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:40.500
But what else do you feel like is coming down the pipe for 2018

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.500
and the Ask Noah program?

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:46.500
Anyone that knows me or has been around me more than a week

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.500
has probably figured this out.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.500
If you're looking for somebody that's going to change a lot of stuff,

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:52.500
I'm not the guy for that.

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:57.500
I'm very much a once I get into the swing of something, I'm fine.

01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:01.500
Now, interestingly enough, I have moved the entire Ask Noah studio

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.500
into my basement.

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:04.500
Really?

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:05.500
Yeah.

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.500
I had a hint of that when we took five and you're like,

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:11.500
oh, little Noah just came down here to hang out with me.

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:12.500
And I'm like, what?

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:13.500
What?

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:14.500
You're not at the office?

01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.500
You didn't go across like five miles of snow?

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.500
What's going on?

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:19.500
Yeah.

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:24.500
So what happened was I broke down and the guys that worked for me

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:28.500
did a really fantastic job kind of setting up a studio

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:29.500
and programming all the stuff.

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:30.500
And they can handle all the technical stuff.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:31.500
That's great.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:35.500
What they don't understand, what they don't know how to do,

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:39.500
the acoustics and the psychoacoustics.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:40.500
So when you speak into a microphone...

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:41.500
I'm sorry.

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.500
I'm sorry.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:43.500
What?

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:44.500
Okay.

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:45.500
Okay.

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:46.500
Acoustics and psychoacoustics.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.500
That's a new field of science.

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:49.500
Noah has a...

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.500
I'm just a podcaster.

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.500
No, I'm not a radio guy.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:52.500
Right.

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:53.500
Well, no, it's anyone that likes audio.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.500
You're in a high quality audio, so you understand this.

01:08:55.500 --> 01:09:00.500
So there's a difference between saying and found that the right

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:03.500
compression ratio is two to one and the gate should be this

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.500
and the trim should be this and this should be this.

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:07.500
That's one way to do it.

01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:09.500
And you can make something sound reasonably good.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:13.500
It's entirely different when you have a studio engineer

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:17.500
that has spent his entire life training his ears to have you

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:20.500
sit down in front of a microphone and talk into that microphone

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:23.500
and say the EQ needs to be adjusted just a little bit here.

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:24.500
Oh, yeah.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.500
I see what you're saying.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.500
I'm like 10 years into that process.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.500
I think I've got another 10 years to go.

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:31.500
There's the tech side and there's the actual end result quality.

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.500
I've got to be like 20, 30 years deep into this business.

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.500
So I don't want to wait 20 or 30 years to be able to actually

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.500
do that, and so I just hired somebody.

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.500
And so these guys are coming in.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.500
What they're doing right now, why I had to get the studio out

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:47.500
of the studio, is first they are treating the wall.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.500
So they're putting things in the corner and they're putting

01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:52.500
things over flat walls and they're using special paint and they

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.500
are putting in special ceiling tiles and we're getting special

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.500
lights and stuff that are aimed specifically at the control

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:00.500
surfaces and they don't reflect onto the VU meters.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:04.500
We have an overbridge, I think they call it.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:08.500
Basically, the meters go left to right instead of up to down.

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.500
So I'm looking at them straight on.

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:11.500
Oh, nice.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.500
So I can keep my audio level consistent.

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.500
But to do all of that, we had to take everything out of the studio.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:20.500
They are running special conduit in the ceilings for all of the

01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.500
audio lines and they're running a line to my office.

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:26.500
So I can have a microphone and a set of headphones in there.

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:29.500
That way, if I'm busy or doing something, I can just dial into

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:32.500
the studio and say, okay, I'll just do the show from here tonight.

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.500
I'm getting worked up.

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:35.500
I'm getting turned on right now, dude.

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:36.500
You are turning me on right now.

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:37.500
This is hot, dude.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:38.500
This is great.

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.500
So they're dealing with all this and obviously they're going

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:44.500
through and showing how to use my audio console that I bought.

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:49.500
So all of those things are happening and we're hoping that it

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.500
was only going to be done for two weeks.

01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:54.500
Now with Christmas and I'm going to be gone for this funeral and

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.500
it's looking like it's going to be closer to like a month.

01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:00.500
So that's probably not be done until after the New Year and after

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:01.500
the time change and all of that.

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:02.500
Can I ask you something?

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:03.500
Yeah.

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:05.500
I mean, before you tell me before it's done, I mean, just to

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:09.500
lead up, like as a tease, I mean, it's a holiday special.

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:10.500
Will you share with the class?

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:13.500
Like, I mean, what does this cost if I wanted to do something

01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:15.500
like this, like for the main studio here?

01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:16.500
Like, what am I looking at?

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.500
Is it a Bitcoin?

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:21.500
Put it in the terms of Bitcoin.

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:22.500
Is it a Bitcoin?

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.500
It's not cheap.

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.500
Is it a Bitcoin?

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:25.500
It's not.

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:26.500
It's not quite a Bitcoin.

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:30.500
It was a couple thousand to have to have them come in and do that.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:33.500
And then the engineer just said to have him come in and for his

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:36.500
time, I think he was charging me 250 an hour or something like

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.500
that to help programs, which it wasn't.

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.500
I wasn't terrible.

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:44.500
The thing I spent far more money in equipment that I have.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:45.500
You know, it's funny, too.

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:46.500
I get requests all the time.

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.500
People are like, oh, show me the inside of the studio.

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:49.500
I'm scared.

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:50.500
I'm scared to show.

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.500
People will think because here's the thing.

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:53.500
I look nuts.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:55.500
Well, it changes all the time.

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:56.500
It's like you do it.

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:59.500
If you did something two weeks ago or a month ago, it's a totally

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:00.500
different studio now.

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.500
I mean, that happens here.

01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:03.500
And this is a fairly static setup.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:08.500
Really, at least equipment wise, really hasn't changed much at all

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:09.500
since I started.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.500
But I didn't mean to interrupt you.

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:12.500
Go ahead and finish up.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:13.500
Where were you going with this?

01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:15.500
Because I mean, I just this is a remarkable investment that you're

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:16.500
doing.

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:19.500
And we're going to have to move to North Dakota ASAP.

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.500
I mean, as soon as the snow melts, I'm going to be out there to do

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.500
all my podcasting, basically.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.500
It's actually funny you say that because one of the things that we

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.500
did when we built the studio.

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.500
So the second for those that don't know, we had I have I have two

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:32.500
studios.

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:36.500
I had one that I put together myself and I set it up as specific.

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:39.500
It was the entire thing was constructed top to bottom to centered

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.500
around the Linux action show.

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:44.500
So everything that I tried to match the dimensions that.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:49.500
On me, so I would have the same amount of space behind me as your

01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:51.500
single camera has on you.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.500
And we know we talked early on, we said, OK, dark backgrounds are

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.500
very difficult for the encoder to process.

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:59.500
So I went with a plain white wall and just hung some pictures like

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:00.500
everything was designed around last.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:03.500
Well, the problem with that is because I was on camera because I

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.500
wanted to look like it's similar to you as possible.

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:08.500
That meant that the audio board and everything was on the other side

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.500
of the room.

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.500
And so when you're doing a radio show and you have people that are

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:14.500
calling in or I want to bring somebody out on mumble or I want to

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:16.500
mute somebody who has their car horn.

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:19.500
Hey, this is you and I just went through this for Linux Fest Northwest.

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:22.500
We redid the whole studio around audio.

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.500
Yeah, right. I totally know what you're doing better.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:25.500
Yep. Yep. Yes.

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:28.500
And what's funny was actually that was a large inspiration for this.

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:31.500
In fact, if you notice, that's when I decided to do a second studio

01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:35.500
because once we completed your studio, I just found myself wanting

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:37.500
to sit down there and work all the time.

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:38.500
In fact, you got to be a joke with Rick.

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:39.500
I can ask him about this.

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:41.500
I for whatever reason.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:43.500
The first word I say on the air, what's the first word I say when I

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.500
start the as no show?

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.500
I don't know. That's the first word.

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.500
So I don't know what the first word I'm trying to think of it.

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:53.500
I'm trying to think of you always have to say, yeah, you live from

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:54.500
Alta speed, right?

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:55.500
Live.

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:56.500
It's always live.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.500
Sometimes it's Alta speed.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:58.500
Sometimes it's somewhere else.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.500
Oh, the first word is always left.

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:04.500
And so when I started to when I was testing live, live, live,

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:06.500
live, right, right.

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.500
And so I was doing all the different stuff.

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:09.500
Check, check, check.

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:13.500
I started making fun of me because he'd come into the studio and there

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:14.500
I am.

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:17.500
And I just I used to say like a little, you know, the first intro,

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:20.500
whatever, just as something to say that I could test it with.

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.500
And then it just got shortened to live.

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:26.500
So then he started coming in, walking up to Mike and going live.

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:27.500
Oh, man.

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:28.500
You know what I do?

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:30.500
I do too, too.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:34.500
I used to be one, two, three, one, two, three.

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:39.500
But the thing is, is that to two has the loudest punch, right?

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:41.500
And that's really that's all I needed.

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:42.500
So I just shorten it now.

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.500
And I sit down and I sit.

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.500
I get to the mic and I get my headphones on.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:46.500
I get the mixer turned on.

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:50.500
I go to to to ever live.

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.500
I sound ridiculous.

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:56.500
The engineer that I'm working with says to use the word toast because

01:14:56.500 --> 01:15:00.500
it apparently contains all of the things that you would all of like the

01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:04.500
A and the O and the A and the and then like you said, the plosives at the

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.500
beginning and the end.

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.500
So apparently toast is a really good.

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.500
I got to give you one of these.

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.500
I got it.

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:12.500
I have been thinking about hiring a consultant from Guitar Center to come

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:16.500
in just because I mean, otherwise what I end up doing is I end up

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:20.500
stacking all of these project was all like I'll have like 10 projects

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:21.500
when Noah gets here for Linux fast.

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.500
And we just we don't really hang out.

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.500
We just go crazy.

01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:29.500
And I'm like, what if I hired a consultant and I had this guy come in

01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:32.500
and he just solved all these problems and Noah showed up and there was

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:33.500
nothing to do.

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:34.500
Like what would we do?

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:35.500
Wow.

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:36.500
You know, we do.

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.500
We don't know.

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.500
You and I would hang out.

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:39.500
First thing we do is we get Indian food.

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:42.500
That's the first thing we would do is we go get the helium Indian food

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:44.500
of taste of Indian taste of India.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.500
Mount Vernon, Washington.

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.500
Go there is the best food of your life.

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:48.500
It'll heal your body.

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:49.500
Taste of India.

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:50.500
Mount Vernon, Washington.

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:51.500
Go there.

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:52.500
Even if you don't go there.

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.500
Go on Yelp and give them a good review, please.

01:15:54.500 --> 01:15:58.500
Because it is it is necessary for Noah and I to continue doing these shows

01:15:58.500 --> 01:15:59.500
that that place exists.

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:00.500
Can I?

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:01.500
Hey, Noah.

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:02.500
This is not related to the show at all.

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:04.500
But I really have been wanting to tell you this because I feel like

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:05.500
you'll understand.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:10.500
I have developed a new routine that I think you will completely agree with

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:12.500
Thursday or Friday.

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.500
Can we go back to your can we go back to your ad for the Indian place and

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:16.500
just do they have a dashboard?

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.500
No, they don't have a dashboard for days.

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:19.500
They have a menu.

01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:23.500
They they do have a menu, but they don't even take online fashion.

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:26.500
I got a couple of other sponsors.

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:27.500
They could build that dashboard this Friday.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:28.500
I called them.

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:32.500
And as the phone is ringing, I mouth I say to Hadi, I'm like, this is the

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:36.500
only restaurant I'm willing to call if they don't like if like today we got

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:39.500
burgers before the show and we got burgers because I could order the burgers

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:40.500
online.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:45.500
I just the thing is, if I order over the phone, it adds more possibility for

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:46.500
air.

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.500
I don't have a problem with talking to people on the phone.

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.500
I'm fine with talking to people.

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.500
It is the the back and forth.

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:56.500
The bandwidth of the phone is not sufficient for the resolution is not

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:58.500
sufficient for people to hear my order sufficiently.

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.500
And so they often screw it up.

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:04.500
I mean, I'm being generous, but I assume this is the problem is that phones

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:05.500
are low bandwidth.

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:09.500
And so if I ordered online, there's the onus is completely on them to fuck it

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:09.500
up.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.500
You know what I'm saying?

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:13.500
And it's very easy for you to review, ensure everything is correct.

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:14.500
In fact, which we did.

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:17.500
I reviewed with you in the beard before we placed the order today on the

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:17.500
phone.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:21.500
So Taste of India is the only place I'm willing to actually call because it

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.500
is restorative food that actually heals my body.

01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:24.500
So I'm willing to call them.

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.500
So I call them up and I have a typical order now.

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:30.500
And I think you'll appreciate this, Noah, as I order three butter chicken,

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:33.500
two garlic naan and one chicken tiki masala.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:36.500
And I eat one of them that order.

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:41.500
I like at lunch and then I save the rest for like the whole weekend.

01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:44.500
I'm eating Indian food, but it's all in the fridge.

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:47.500
And I just go to it as necessary.

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:49.500
And I'll even go breakfast.

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:50.500
I'll even do breakfast.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.500
Noah about Indian food is it fills you up and you stay filled up like

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:56.500
anyone that eats Chinese.

01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:58.500
You know how you eat it and then like four hours later, you're hungry

01:17:58.500 --> 01:17:58.500
again.

01:17:58.500 --> 01:18:00.500
That never happens to me with Indian food.

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:04.500
Like if I eat if I get filled up, I'm full for a day.

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:04.500
Yeah.

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:05.500
Yeah.

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:08.500
There's actual anti-inflammatories in Indian food as well.

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:10.500
So depending on the ones you get.

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.500
So if you get butter chicken, there's anti-inflammatories in there.

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.500
That seems like a good thing to me, Wes.

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:17.500
And, you know, when you're sitting there typing all the time, you get

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:18.500
the carpal tunnel, eat some Indian food.

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:21.500
I'm just saying maybe it helps drink a little beer.

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:24.500
Indian food could be the perfect recipe for the Linux user.

01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:28.500
I could be wrong, but I suspect it's true.

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:32.500
So here's what I decided is next time Noah comes out, we got to have

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:33.500
the least amount of work possible.

01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.500
No projects here.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.500
And well, that's never going to happen.

01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:37.500
I don't think.

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:39.500
But maybe you can do the projects you want to do.

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:43.500
If I came out there and there was nothing to do, you and I would invent

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.500
something to do like we would start a new project.

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:46.500
That's what happened.

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:49.500
Yeah, like build an audio studio in the RV.

01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:52.500
And the other the other project that I wouldn't mind now that we're now

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:53.500
we're now this is really a holiday special.

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:54.500
We're going off the rails here.

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:57.500
But the other project I wouldn't mind is building an audio studio at

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:58.500
Wes's house.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.500
Oh, yeah.

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:00.500
Because Wes is doing more and more stuff.

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:03.500
It's more and more of an ask for Wes to come up to Arlington because

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:05.500
he lives in Seattle like a maniac.

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:06.500
That's right.

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:10.500
So, you know, a little sound booth with like a nice dynamic microphone.

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:11.500
That sounds really great.

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:12.500
Yeah.

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:14.500
So there's got that down to us.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.500
We could bang that out here.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:18.500
So anyway, I want to I just want to finish one last thing up and then

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:19.500
then we can move on.

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:22.500
But so you were saying you're saying, I want to come to North Dakota.

01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:25.500
So interestingly, one of the things I made sure to do when we were

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:29.500
putting this together was we built it future proof.

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:33.500
So we I only need four channels realistically to do the show.

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.500
I need my mic.

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:35.500
I need the phones.

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:41.500
I need the if I have a remote guest and I need the the music bed stuff.

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:47.500
And but but we built it with 16 16 inputs.

01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.500
And I think we've got eight.

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.500
No, we got 12 outputs.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:54.500
So we can do basically an unlimited.

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:56.500
And then with the software drivers that allow us to pull audio in and out,

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.500
we can do basically an unlimited amount of mixed minuses.

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:04.500
And so and the reason that I we splurged to get the extra capacity was if

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:07.500
the day ever comes where you call me up and say, I'm going to do shows

01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:10.500
from the road and beer doesn't live in the studio anymore.

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:15.500
So I need some place to remote into to put all of the people together or whatever.

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:16.500
We can accommodate.

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:19.500
Oh, man, we're halfway there already.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:20.500
Right, right.

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.500
So you want to come to Grand Fork.

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.500
Not only can you come to Grand Forks, you come to shows from here.

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:24.500
You know, well, it's nice and warm.

01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:25.500
We go to the lake, whatever.

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.500
You can do shows on the road on the way here.

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:28.500
Oh, man.

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.500
Man, isn't that going to be something, Noah?

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:31.500
That'll be that's great.

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:32.500
That's great.

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:35.500
Because Beard's actually as we record the special holiday edition of the

01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:38.500
Unplugged program, he's over there packing up right now.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:42.500
The Beard's moving out and it's a new era for the studio.

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:44.500
I mean, it's a little empty nest syndrome here.

01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:47.500
So it is, it is.

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:49.500
Your baby has grown up and moved out.

01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:50.500
Yeah, yeah, man.

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:51.500
Yeah, it's true.

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:52.500
It's true.

01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:55.500
You're going to show up here in the morning, getting a bunch of work done all alone.

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.500
No one to complain to, no one to gripe about.

01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:58.500
That's actually been so nice.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.500
Just off the record.

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:04.500
But at the same time, like it's lonely.

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.500
Pantsless in the studio.

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:10.500
Like now, now I go from like, you know, home to here and I don't talk to anybody.

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:13.500
I just have my dog, Levi, me and Levi at the studio.

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:15.500
So I'm going to have to come visit Noah.

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:16.500
Good thing you got him.

01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:19.500
I'm glad Noah built all this because I'm going to have to go, I'm going to have to either

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.500
hit the road to visit with listeners or I'm going to have to go move to Grand Forks.

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:25.500
If it wasn't for Wes coming up here every now and then to do this show, I'd just, I'd

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:26.500
be totally alone.

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:30.500
And yet I'm perfectly okay with that.

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:37.500
I am not a big, I'm not, I've never been big on like the walk and talk at work and bumping

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.500
people into the, into the hallway.

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:40.500
Because when I was-

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.500
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:42.500
Okay.

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:43.500
You must have not worked in a big office because-

01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:44.500
Oh, I did.

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:45.500
Bump into people at work.

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.500
It's bump into people at the copier.

01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:48.500
Or, or-

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:49.500
Or the water thing.

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.500
Or the water thing.

01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:54.500
Or just the hallway from the lunchroom to the IT room was the, I just, it was the land

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:57.500
mine of IT requests that were never documented.

01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:02.500
So, I developed this instinctual like, I don't want to have a conversation.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:06.500
I want to walk from the lunchroom to my desk and sit down and get my job done because if

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.900
you talk to me, you're not putting in a ticket and then I can't track it.

01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:12.540
I can't account for it and I'll forget to do it.

01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:21.500
And so I developed like this, this weird anti like, like bump into each other and just hang

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:23.540
out and chat at the workplace.

01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:26.580
And yet at the same time, I find it to be one of the most valuable sources of creative

01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:28.420
inspiration and discussion.

01:22:28.420 --> 01:22:31.780
And so it's, it'll be like something I miss the most and something that'll be the most

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:36.720
like, not beneficial, but like I've been missing it.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:41.340
Like just the total solitude, no, like nobody interrupts my thought process.

01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:44.980
At the same time, I will miss the creative exchange of ideas and all of that.

01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:47.660
So I'll just have to come hang out with you at work, Wes.

01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:48.660
Yeah, absolutely.

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:49.660
That feel good?

01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:50.660
That feels good?

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:51.660
Yeah.

01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:52.660
All right.

01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:54.100
Oh, well, I think that's it.

01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:56.060
I think, I think we've done our holiday due diligence.

01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:57.060
Yeah.

01:22:57.060 --> 01:22:58.780
I hope you've had a good, did you enjoy your holiday burger?

01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:00.260
Oh, very much so.

01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:01.260
What about you Noah?

01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:04.020
Did you do any holiday related festivities over there in Grand Fork?

01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:07.020
Did you have some mistletoe or something in the office?

01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:09.020
I mean, come on, I need something.

01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:13.100
I actually, I have a new thing that I'm implementing at UltraSpeed this year and it's called Mistle

01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:15.100
Foe instead of Mistletoe.

01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:19.420
And so basically what we're going to do is we're hanging mistletoe up and you have to

01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:20.420
fight.

01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:23.580
If you find yourself under the mistletoe, then you have to fight.

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:29.300
Well, I think it's, it's just in the, you know, in the spirit, you get, get all your

01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:32.820
rage and aggression out and you go into the new year friends again.

01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:35.740
We have the worst Christmas music ever right here.

01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:36.740
There you go.

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:37.740
Boom.

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:38.740
Actually, sorry.

01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:39.740
It's not Christmas.

01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:40.740
It's holiday music.

01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:46.060
It's, we have the worst holiday music ever and we have you, we have me, we have Noah.

01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:47.060
It feels pretty good.

01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:49.620
The only thing that's missing is the lug, but yeah, this was a special edition.

01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:50.820
I hope they're all at home.

01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:51.820
They're all.

01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:52.820
Yeah.

01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.700
Having to go put themselves out and help us.

01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:55.700
Yeah.

01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:56.700
They get to relax with their family.

01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:57.700
Put on some Linux.

01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:59.820
And totally enjoy a random show they never expected.

01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:02.260
It's just been recorded to, to just.

01:24:02.260 --> 01:24:03.260
Our little present.

01:24:03.260 --> 01:24:04.260
Nobody knows.

01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:06.220
It's our present from, from us to the audience.

01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:08.620

01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:19.300
Yeah.

01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:20.300
