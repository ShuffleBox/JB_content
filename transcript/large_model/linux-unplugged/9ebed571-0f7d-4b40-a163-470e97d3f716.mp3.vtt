WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
The internet should be simple and safe.

00:03.000 --> 00:08.000
We strongly believe that having nothing to hide shouldn't mean having to show it all.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
This is Silent Keys.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
A beautiful and secure keyboard that defends your privacy.

00:16.000 --> 00:24.000
Open source and plug and play, Silent Keys protects you from viruses, ransomware, mass surveillance and identity theft.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
Stop governments, employers, search engines and credit agencies from seeing what you do online.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Browse without fear and protect who you are, what you do and what you like.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
Block annoying tracking ads and encrypt all your traffic so you can surf the web privately.

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
Every year, millions of people experience banking fraud and lose their savings.

00:47.000 --> 00:54.000
Be safe from keyloggers when accessing online banking, Bitcoin and social media.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.000
Stream your favorite TV shows from all over the world with no restrictions.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.000
Because a simple keylogger can record all your keystrokes and defeat the best security,

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
we created a tamper-proof keyboard, an aluminum shell that can't be opened without breaking.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
It's really easy to use. Plug it in, press a button and boot.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
Silent Keys includes Satya, a modern and secure desktop.

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
The best way to protect an operating system against viruses is to make it read-only and have it load from scratch at every use.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
This makes it immune to insecure systems and leaves no trace.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
Just like a CD-ROM.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
Silent Keys features a secure update switch with free and unlimited updates.

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
To protect your privacy and prevent data leaks, Silent Keys automatically encrypts your web connection using Tor or VPN.

01:50.000 --> 01:58.000
Anonymous browsing on Silent Keys safely counters fake Wi-Fi, ISP snooping, mass surveillance and hackers.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
All ads are blocked too.

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Secure messaging and end-to-end encryption for your email comes out of the box.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
That is the slowest email encryption I've ever seen.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
Okay, if this is legit, if they can make this something that's really simple for the average person, it's not so bad.

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
But look at this, Wes, 616 backers. They were only going for $55,000, they've raised $105,000.

02:20.000 --> 02:28.000
So they're scratching some itch, but it's essentially a read-only live GNOME desktop with a decent GNOME theme.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Yeah, I mean, it doesn't look bad.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
You know what, Wes?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Why is it a keyboard as well?

02:33.000 --> 02:37.000
Well, because then it's the tamper-proof device where it freaks out when it gets broken.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
You know what, guys? This is what it tells us.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
It doesn't matter about the technical whiz-bang because, you know, they mean this is or it is what it is.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
It may or may not be hacker-proof, right?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Right.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
What it does tell you is that we are in the wrong business.

02:52.000 --> 03:09.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 150 for June 21st, 2016.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that is awash in distribution releases.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
My name is Chris.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
My name is Wes.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
How about it, Wes?

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Like today, this week at least, it giveth.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
We have some great releases to talk about today that are super fresh.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
We've got a Mycroft update that I'm really excited to talk about for multiple reasons.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
We'll tell you guys all about that.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Some cool hardware coming for Ubuntu Phone.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
A free great game for Linux this week.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
DockerCon's going on right now, and I've snussed out – snussed out?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
That's sussed and sniffed.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
I snussed out some of the best stuff.

03:43.000 --> 03:50.000
And then coming up last but not least, we're going to look at Maroo?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Maroo OS.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
The desktop on your Android phone.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
Yeah, it's – they claim they've got Convergence, and they've based it on Debian, and it's here today.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
And I – it uses like Wayland or some shenanigans.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
Like there's some crazy far out future technology in that thing.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
I don't know, Wes.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
You have to dig into that.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Wes has got a load on his phone.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
He'll give us his take, how it runs on his Nexus 5.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
And towards the end, Flatpaks, they're officially here.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah, you know, universal software installation.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
That's another universal answer.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Another standard Flatpak.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Now we've got Snaps, Flatpaks, App Images.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
They're all competing to essentially do the same thing.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
But we've already talked about that aspect of it.

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
But since we started that conversation, people have gone to war.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
It is a fast-moving story.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Holy.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
I mean, I don't want to drop an S-bomb at the top of the show.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
I'm sure we were all like kind of bitter about Linux packaging or something.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
I don't know.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
I mean, it has gone to full-fledged war over this.

04:44.000 --> 04:51.000
And boy, my – somehow because I talked on two shows, I have wandered in the middle of this.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
And I am just getting slammed on all sides.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
And we're going to just talk a little bit about it today in the show.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
And we'll see.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Depending on how far this beer gets me, I may get a little ranty, but I doubt it.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
Because we just got one great beer here from Fremont Brewing just a bit down the road.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Just a piece from where you probably work.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
I mean, not too far.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
All things considered, coming right out of a local Seattle brewery.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Because beer matters, it says.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
This is the Summer Ale, their American Pale Ale.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
This looks like a nice treat, Wes.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
And I've got to say, too, it's got a good color to it.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Do I have the camera on?

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Yeah.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
You guys probably can't make it out.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Yeah, it's a little dark.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
But it has a really good color to it.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Oh, I didn't open mine.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Jeez.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Come on, Chris.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Let's see.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Let's document the hazard and mess right now.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
There we go.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
So we will be –

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
We've come prepared.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Yeah.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
We've been enjoying that during the show today.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
So we've got a lot to get into.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Let's bring in our virtual lug.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
Time appropriate greetings, Mumba Room.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Hey, yo.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Good to see you.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Hello.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Wow.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
I really caught – look at that.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
I caught them off guard.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Did you see that?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Yes, you did.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
All right.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
So guys, I already asked you on the pre-show.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
So I already know the answer.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
We haven't really got a chance to kick the tires yet.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
I'm going to hold my powder drive for the segment.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
But Fedora 24 is officially out today.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
And there are some really nice things in this one.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
Mainly, the one that I'm really looking forward to is in GNOME 3.20 is in this.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Also, talked about it just a bit briefly there,

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Flatpak support is also included in this version of Fedora.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
So they have sort of an official, unofficial upgrade guide,

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
I'm going to call it, that we will link in the show notes.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Interesting.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Yeah, where you can do an update.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
And I have a – just put it actually recently back into production a bit.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I'll tell you about that later in the show.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
The Fedora Cloud installation that I have running a couple of different containers

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
and whatnots that I'm going to do an upgrade from 23 to 24 as part of my –

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
I'll be curious to see what you think about that.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
Yeah, I'll give you my thoughts.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Part of my review in Linux Action Show on Sunday, I'll talk about Fedora 24.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
But congrats to Fedora for getting a release out, shipping it with GNOME 3.20 in there.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
And I think it's got kernel 4.5 or some shenanigans like that.

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
And of course, looking pretty solid with the Flatpak support.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
So that's Fedora.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
We don't have a lot to say about it because we have so much to cover.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
Why don't we jump into a little Mycroft news because Ryan is joining us today.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Wonderful.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Welcome back to Unplugged, Mr. Ryan.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Hey, it's good to be back.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Thank you, sir.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Thank you.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you very much for being here.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
We really do appreciate it.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
So tell me about version.7, responsive listening, third-party skills, a new voice,

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
the big update, and better emotions on the front panel too.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Like there's a lot to cover here.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
But what the hell is responsive listening?

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
Can we start there?

07:27.000 --> 07:35.000
Responsive listening is a name I came up with because I didn't have a good name for how to describe it.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
But for the longest time, and you'll see this in the blog post that I made,

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
we played around with this idea of passive listening, and it worked all right.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
And that was the deal where you can say an entire sentence, put Mycroft's name anywhere,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
and it will trigger and then take action.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
But what we found was that lots of people were already interacting with the device

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
in the way that Google now has trained them, and Siri and the Echo.

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
And so they were saying, you know, hey, Mycroft, and then saying whatever they were going to say.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
How were they supposed to be saying it beforehand?

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Well, it's not that they couldn't say it that way.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
It's that they could insert the name anywhere that they wanted to.

08:17.000 --> 08:26.000
Oh, so the actual Mycroft part of the sentence, the word Mycroft might be four or five words into the sentence,

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
and the system would have to be able to wake up and scan back to find what was said before the name, right?

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
Correct, and it was pretty cool technology, but people didn't understand the latency that came from that.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
And it was only about a second, but there are now expectations,

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
especially because people are comparing us against the Echo.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.000
And so what we've done is we've gone ahead and put responsive listening as the default.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
So you say, hey, Mycroft, and then your query, and it comes back pretty much instantaneously.

08:57.000 --> 09:04.000
And then what we've done is we've gone ahead and begun working on making the existing passive listening,

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
is what we called it, an option that people can just go in and check in the config.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Oh, that's neat.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
Responsive listening, that's a good name.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
And I guess I assumed because of that's how, like you just said,

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
all of the other assistants that are sort of on the market right now operate the other way.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I just assumed that would be the way Mycroft would operate.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
There's so many little aspects to this.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
And Ryan, it got me thinking about sort of an advantage that Mycroft might have,

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
being open source, where the code can be publicly audited.

09:37.000 --> 09:44.000
People have a higher level of trust in it than say maybe the Alexa or the Google stuff,

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
because you don't really fully understand their complete motivation behind the product.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
You have a pretty good idea, though.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
And with Mycroft, everything being kind of out in the public,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
it doesn't quite matter what the motivation is,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
because you can still see what the end result is literally for yourself.

09:59.000 --> 10:06.000
And so that gives Mycroft the opportunity to maybe be a little creepier than say Google or Amazon can be.

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
Like it could eventually give Mycroft room to say,

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
hey, would you optionally like that we listen to everything all the time?

10:14.000 --> 10:19.000
I mean, there's like a lot of different things that people might be willing to let a fully open source assistant do

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
that they wouldn't want a commercial version to do.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Am I making sense here?

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
Yeah, but you're operating under the assumption that the Echo isn't already listening all the time.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Well, yeah, that's true.

10:32.000 --> 10:42.000
But yeah, and what we're hoping is that eventually I think that's the way that a lot of these little smart assistants will be,

10:42.000 --> 10:49.000
regardless of whether or not they're in a dedicated device in your house or on your phone or wherever.

10:49.000 --> 10:54.000
The question is about trust and about whether or not, because I think eventually,

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
and we talked about this at one of our meetings, one of our all hands meetings,

10:59.000 --> 11:07.000
somebody brought the fact that eventually they thought that the benefits would outweigh what a lot of people saw as security concerns.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.000
I'm not saying that that's how we feel.

11:10.000 --> 11:21.000
But, you know, it's the idea that it could listen and be smart enough to actually offer you up suggestions

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
or take notes for you that you might forget to take yourself and things like that.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
Those benefits might eventually outweigh people's privacy concerns.

11:31.000 --> 11:37.000
But the worry is, you know, what company are you going to want to trust your data with?

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
Are you going to want to trust your data with a company?

11:40.000 --> 11:48.000
Being an open source company, an open source project, we get to be a little more transparent with users

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
and let them know, you know, here's kind of how things are.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
You can audit the code and make sure that it's only listening when you want it to

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
and not have to do some sort of crazy gymnastics to figure out what exactly is happening with your data

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
and whether or not you just bugged your house.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
Yeah, and what exactly is it that they're storing and why are they storing it?

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
You know, you make a good point because I think, unfortunately, and I want to make sure that sinks in

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
because I always get pushback on this, unfortunately, I think you are right in the sense that

12:21.000 --> 12:29.000
the convenience that a lot of these different platforms offer, be it iOS or Android or the entire Google platform,

12:29.000 --> 12:35.000
it is, for people who just need a little extra help in life, it is actually very tempting.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.000
And it seems to me that if they're willing to make that concession to use Google, like I have recently

12:41.000 --> 12:48.000
kind of started going all in with Google because Google Photos is just, they just happen to nail something

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
that is exceedingly important to me as a father of three young, adorable children.

12:52.000 --> 13:00.000
Google Photos is one of two offsite backups, plus I have a local storage of all my photos.

13:00.000 --> 13:08.000
And the ability to search that and say, you know, Grandma and Hugs and Dylan and get all that mapped out is super useful.

13:08.000 --> 13:14.000
And then I started using Google Fit because I'm starting to exercise more and getting all of that information,

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
being able to use different devices for different tasks and have all of them report back to Google Fit

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
as a central input to get all of this. So now I have like one spot to go to get a lot of different information

13:25.000 --> 13:34.000
from weight, water, sleep, quality, walks, all of this information is in one dashboard for me now.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
With charts and all this kind of crap that is very nice to have.

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
And of course I know, I am fully intellectually aware of what that means they are doing in terms of tracking

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
and the information they're building about me. And if I had a better solution for some of this stuff,

13:48.000 --> 13:55.000
I immediately would probably go somewhere else. So I think even if Mycroft gets to the market in a year or two

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
where they're competitive at some of these levels, be it the artificial assistant where you can prompt it

14:00.000 --> 14:06.000
and ask it questions or whatever it is, I think if people are already like me who are very aware of the problem

14:06.000 --> 14:11.000
and are still willing to make the concession, as soon as something like this comes along,

14:11.000 --> 14:17.000
it's going to be like, I'll be an early adopter, we've got to go all in on this.

14:17.000 --> 14:24.000
I think it's from people like me to just the average person are going to be really responsive to a product like that.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
That's a big one.

14:26.000 --> 14:34.000
I think that what we have to do as a community is consider what we want the future of this stuff to look like.

14:34.000 --> 14:45.000
It's so crazy how locked down this specific technology is with these providers that aren't Mycroft.

14:45.000 --> 14:52.000
They're much more locked down than let's say like Android, which is slowly moving that direction.

14:52.000 --> 15:01.000
But when it comes to these intelligent personal assistants, it's really, really a black box.

15:01.000 --> 15:09.000
What's crazy is they're quickly becoming one of the most intimate things you interact with.

15:09.000 --> 15:18.000
What I think is that we should have an answer and that's what we're trying to do with Mycroft.

15:18.000 --> 15:26.000
One thing I wanted to get back to is before we talk about all the crazy stuff going on in this space,

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
I wanted to talk a little bit more about the release because you talked about a couple of things that were in there.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
One thing I want to know more about is third party skills and things like that too.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
Absolutely. That was the end of discussion on that. I was kind of curious to go more back to the 0.7 release.

15:42.000 --> 15:49.000
For those with developer kits, we got a lot of new face animations.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
It's a lot more responsive.

15:51.000 --> 15:57.000
We're looking at trying to present data on the face on that little LED array.

15:57.000 --> 16:06.000
Whenever you ask for the weather, it gives a really nice, clean interface for seeing the weather as well as other things like that.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
Then third party skills, which you talked about.

16:09.000 --> 16:16.000
This is the beginning of something we've been planning for a long time was a way to install third party skills.

16:16.000 --> 16:24.000
Right now, you have to literally drop the skills into a directory for them to be loaded when Mycroft starts.

16:24.000 --> 16:34.000
We're building a skill management system that talks to a repo full of skills people have submitted.

16:34.000 --> 16:42.000
The idea is that you can just add a Roku skill and various other skills.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
Oh, man, Ryan. Oh, man.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
The thing is, there's already third party skills out there.

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
We need to get a list of those so that people can start playing with them now.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
That's why we kind of accelerated this piece because we keep getting people saying,

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
Hey, I wrote a skill. Will you accept it in the core?

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
We have to walk this line of, yeah, that's a really cool skill, but I don't think most people use that.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I know that there are people who will use it.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
Let's see about getting it, making it installable by people.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.000
For instance, there's this one called diagnostic skill,

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
and you can ask it all sorts of questions about your system that Mycroft is running on.

17:19.000 --> 17:27.000
What's the CPU usage? What's the RAM usage? Things like that.

17:27.000 --> 17:31.000
Then we also saw, oh, boy, there's lots of skills.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Mycroft is a little bit more personal now.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
You can say, how are you doing? Hello?

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Hello, that's so sweet.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.000
I'm not sure if it's still in there, but for a while, when you asked him how he's doing,

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
sometimes he would tell you a little bit about what's going on.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
He would say, hey, I'm doing good. I'm busy.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
Then he would list off a few processes that were running on the bar.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
That's awesome.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
That's really funny.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
I secretly use Arch Linux.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
Yeah, and we got a new voice, too.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
That's cool. In fact, we have an example.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.000
Poppy posted this. I think he's pretty excited by this.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
This is the new...

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
74, Lawrence, Kansas has few clouds and is currently 76 degrees.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Yeah, here, I'll start from the very beginning.

18:18.000 --> 18:26.000
With a high of 78 and a low of 74, Lawrence, Kansas has few clouds and is currently 76 degrees.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Certainly a little robotic, Ryan, but that's pretty...

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
That's really cool.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah, I mean, it definitely sounds like Poppy.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
It sure does.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
That's amazing.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.000
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
We're continuing to make improvements to that voice,

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
but frankly, now I'm very accustomed to it.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
Yeah.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Poppy keeps talking to me every day.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Fake Poppy.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
It kind of makes me want to be able to address the unit as Fake Poppy.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
You know?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
That's...

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Phoebe.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Yeah.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Phoebe.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
Okay, and also, I saw there's a Debian repo.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
Oh, I'm excited for that.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
That sounds great.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
So if I'm...

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
What does this mean?

19:04.000 --> 19:05.000
Can you...

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
Is it just now a couple of app sources away and now I can install all the Minecraft packages?

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
So, yeah, we have an app repo.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
Aaron, our systems administrator, he's been on here before,

19:15.000 --> 19:21.000
ran into a problem that he talked to the packaging community about.

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
So I think that repo will probably be shared out, I would guess, tomorrow.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Yeah, I don't know if you got the memo, Ryan.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
We're all about snaps now, so not repos.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
No, flat packs.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
Oh, flat packs.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Yeah.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
No, snaps.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
I know.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
I'm very, very familiar with snaps.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
I'm very, very familiar now with flat pack.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
We're playing around with those.

19:45.000 --> 19:52.000
We have a snaps repo up where people can watch as we package that up.

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
And at this point, we're just asking for help on all of our packaging.

19:57.000 --> 20:04.000
We want to package in all of the different standards for every repo,

20:04.000 --> 20:10.000
as I know that we've been talking a lot about lately with the universal...

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
all these different universal packaging...

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
Solve, yeah, all these universal solve all problems standards,

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
which we're going to talk more about when we get to flat packs in a bit.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
But yeah, it's...

20:22.000 --> 20:27.000
But we're just trying to package Mycroft in as many...

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
get it to as many different people as possible, and that's kind of our focus.

20:30.000 --> 20:34.000
So if people in the Jupyter Broadcasting community want to help us do that,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
that would be great.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
And then finally, we've got...

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
if you look at the bottom of the blog post,

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
which I hope that you'll post in the show notes,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
there's a few other projects that we're working on.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
We're working on a community website

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
that has a lot of information for those who are interested

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
in contributing to the open source side of Mycroft.

20:57.000 --> 21:02.000
And then we're working on just all this stuff that you can see in GitHub

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
as far as, like, we have an issue tracker

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
and we've just been throwing all of our ideas in there.

21:07.000 --> 21:11.000
And so we're really getting tons and tons of feedback,

21:11.000 --> 21:15.000
and lots of people are submitting front ends for Mycroft.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
We now have a plasmoid...

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
a home extension, an Electron front end, an Android app.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
Oh, cool. Oh, man.

21:25.000 --> 21:29.000
So it's coming in really, really fast, so fast, in fact,

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
that we're finding it really, really difficult to answer all the questions

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
as people charge ahead, but that's a great problem to have.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
You know what would be a killer feature in comparison to the Echo

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
and probably even the Google Assistant and Siri is

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
if somehow all of these...

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
if I had it on an Android device on my desktop and in the hardware device,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
I know we've kind of mentioned this before,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
but if somehow all of these were connected in some way

21:52.000 --> 21:56.000
where if one of them learned something or could, like,

21:56.000 --> 21:59.000
if I could, say, send a telegram to Wes to one of them,

21:59.000 --> 22:02.000
all of them can have that functionality without me having to install an app

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
on each one or install a third-party feature on each one.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.000
Like, if at the end of it, you know, maybe it's a couple years down the road,

22:10.000 --> 22:15.000
these different Mycroft endpoints all felt like a shared brain,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
truly got us closer to Jarvis.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
Because right now, all the other AI assistants,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
they're each their own individual thing.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
Like, if you're using Siri and you have an iPad and an iPhone

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
and now you're going to have it on the Mac OS,

22:27.000 --> 22:32.000
you literally, you could say, you know, hey, telephone,

22:32.000 --> 22:36.000
and it will, if they're all in the same proximity, they'll all light up

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
and they'll all try to answer the question like a bunch of dummies

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
and each one of them doesn't have any idea that there's another instance

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
of it running.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Now, I don't know what the solution is there, but if there was some way

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
to make it feel like one cohesive intelligent system, Ryan,

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
is that possible? Is that within Mycroft's future?

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Yeah, it is.

22:55.000 --> 22:59.000
It was one of our day one features working on,

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
and we're still working to make it so that the units are aware of each other.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.000
They live in what we call a domain.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
They're supposed to eventually have awareness of each other,

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
and if, for instance, two of them pick up the same thing,

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
go through some very, very quick election process to say,

23:19.000 --> 23:23.000
you're getting the better stream, you're in a better position

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
to answer this question, you go ahead and do it.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
And the other thing, too, is that we already have shared configuration

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
across instances.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
I have four Mycroft instances.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
They're all in the same settings, and that's all done through our backend,

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
which is currently named Cerberus.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
However, a lot of our backend stuff is going to be getting a really,

23:48.000 --> 23:54.000
really big update soon, and so you'll see maybe that name go away

23:54.000 --> 24:02.000
and a true backend that really feels comfortable to use

24:02.000 --> 24:07.000
and is really a great user experience comes to the forefront.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
We're super, super busy, but everything's going great,

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
and we're trying to build as many relationships right now

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
with folks who are packaging software and folks who are interested

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
in working on frontends for Mycroft to just let it permeate

24:22.000 --> 24:27.000
to as many different places as possible and to make that process

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
of getting started with Mycroft that much easier.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
It's great you guys are working on snaps.

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
Do you know what it is in packages that started to land in the AUR?

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
That'd be great, too.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
I don't know.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
The thing is, every time I check out the AUR for a project that I work on,

24:42.000 --> 24:46.000
someone has already beat me to it by the time I go to package stuff.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
So it wouldn't surprise me if there was already Mycroft in the AUR,

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
and I've got an Arch machine in front of me right now,

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
and I haven't taken the time to check, but it wouldn't surprise me at all.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
I've been working really, really hard on trying to help people

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
get the information they need to finish their frontends.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
I'm super interested in the GNOME extension and the Android app.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Yeah, that is looking really good.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
So, Ryan, my last question.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Are you ever going to make it out to Washington?

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
Because we've got to Mycroft up the JB Studio like nuts.

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
Yeah, I actually was just contemplating this the other day.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
Now that we've really got so much done, I'm interested to come out

25:29.000 --> 25:36.000
and not only hook up the JB Studio, but also Lady Jupiter with Mycroft.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
We've got it controlling some things like the Nest

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
and some early smart things stuff and Philips Hue stuff,

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
so maybe we'll also have to see if we can figure out some smart things

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
to pimp your place out with.

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
Yeah, that's going to be so ridiculous, because I actually,

25:55.000 --> 26:01.000
a couple of months down the road, am going to go on a road trip

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
to go to a developer summit, and I think I'm going to do

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
a Lady Jupiter technology rover log video for that.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I probably should have just said that out loud, because now I have to do it.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Damn it!

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Yeah, I'm wondering if we can put like a,

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
what's your internet connection like when you're in Lady Jupiter?

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
It depends on where I'm at, very much.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
Anywhere from a megabit, you know, 700 kilobits a second

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
to up to 30, 40 megabits, depending on location.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
Well, the thing that we could do that I think would be really cool

26:33.000 --> 26:36.000
is to take like a NUC and hide it somewhere in Lady Jupiter

26:36.000 --> 26:42.000
and then connect it to like this complex microphone system

26:42.000 --> 26:47.000
throughout the thing, so it's just one brain all the time.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
You know what, I actually have a spot.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
There is a spot underneath one of my seats,

26:53.000 --> 26:58.000
there's an AC outlet underneath the seat, and it's an open space,

26:58.000 --> 27:04.000
and I already have a Linux powered access point and router down there.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
So I was just planning to kind of expand that out,

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
and I got a spot in there for a NUC already.

27:08.000 --> 27:13.000
If we got a dedicated, somebody who's been working on an Electron app,

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
it'd be cool if you full screen that Electron app on like a display.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
Oh, totally.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
Oh, man.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
Totally, totally.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000
Oh, man.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.000
Lady Jupes, you know what would be really cool is

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
Lady Jupes has an outside outdoor television,

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
and so like when we go to like, you know, like summits and stuff.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
Lady Jupes played the live stream.

27:33.000 --> 27:36.000
Yeah, put that up on the TV, on the outdoor TV.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
That would be really crazy cool.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
And actually, all the video is routed to a switcher,

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
so it would be no problem.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
We just send the feed.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
Yeah.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
It's easy peasy.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
So people want to know in the chat room,

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
is there anywhere that they can find the Android app yet?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.000
Is that out yet?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
You can.

27:52.000 --> 27:59.000
I would tell everybody to go to the docs.microsoft.ai,

27:59.000 --> 28:05.000
and there's a little contributing option there where you can see like

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
all the ways to get involved.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
And if you join either our IRC or our Slack channel,

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
we've been talking about it a lot lately,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
and if you're a community member who's working on it,

28:15.000 --> 28:20.000
I'm not entirely certain that he's popped it into the repo yet,

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
but I'll ask him because I know he's collaborating with somebody else

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
in the community, so they have to be collaborating somehow.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.000
So maybe it exists, and I just haven't gone and visited it yet.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
So it sounds like it's an open source Android app?

28:30.000 --> 28:35.000
Yeah, yeah, and it runs the full stack on the device too.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Wow.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Like, my crop is running on the device.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Holy crap.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
I want to try that.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
It's not hitting an API or anything.

28:43.000 --> 28:48.000
We got a pull request a while back that took,

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
so this is a core on a Raspberry Pi, so bear this in mind.

28:51.000 --> 28:58.000
It took it down from using 100% of one core on a Raspberry Pi to less than 1%,

28:58.000 --> 29:02.000
just based on improvements that we made to the listener.

29:02.000 --> 29:08.000
And so since we did that, we've been loading it on many, many small devices,

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
and it's been flying.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
That's awesome.

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
And a lot of phones, a lot of Android phones,

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
are actually more powerful than a Raspberry Pi.

29:16.000 --> 29:20.000
So from what I saw in the little demo video,

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
and I'll try and share it with you,

29:22.000 --> 29:26.000
because the guy recorded his son talking to his phone

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
and the Android app answering.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.000
Wow.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
It seemed to be running just fine.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
That's amazing.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
So what you're telling me is you pulled a Richard,

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
and you Pied Pipered this thing, and you went from like 99,

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
and you just cut it.

29:41.000 --> 29:46.000
That's an incredible reduction from maxing out a CPU core to 1% CPU usage.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Now you just have Minecraft everywhere with me.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
That's what you get for...

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
It was a community member.

29:52.000 --> 29:55.000
He now is an intern, but he wasn't at the time.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
Isn't that awesome?

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
And so we can't really take...

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
I mean, I guess we can take credit for it now that he works for us,

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
but at the time we couldn't.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
That's a huge benefit of being open source.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Man, that feels good.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
Well, Ryan, thank you for the update.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
And if you are able to stick around,

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
we will be getting into Flatpak and Snaps in a little bit,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
and I'd love to hear some of your thoughts on that.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
While you're just mentioning...

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Yeah, go ahead.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
I can say something that gets me yelled at.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
That's what this show is for.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I got to tell you, don't worry, nobody's listening,

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
nobody's going to comment afterwards.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Certainly not.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Don't have to worry about that at all, Ryan.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
There's not even a subreddit for it.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
There's not even a subreddit.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
We were just talking about the Android phones.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
OnePlus 3, you know, the new OnePlus phone,

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
which is just getting complicated.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
Very complicated.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
OnePlus 3 looks like it's going to become

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
an unofficial Ubuntu phone, though.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
There is some interest out there by the ubports.com folks,

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
a group of independent developers.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.000
They're going to port Ubuntu Touch to the OnePlus 3.

30:55.000 --> 31:00.000
This would make the Ubuntu Touch available on a very nice,

31:00.000 --> 31:04.000
modern, capable, fast, and very well-reviewed smartphone.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Considering a new smartphone, maybe the OnePlus 3

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
should be my future.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
Maybe, because it's getting really good reviews, too.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
I mean, I want convergence, right?

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
Like, who doesn't?

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
Well, we'll find out how Maru works on your phone

31:15.000 --> 31:16.000
in just a little bit.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Speaking of phones, let's also just take a moment right here.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Guess who we're going to talk about, Wes.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.000
Do you have a guess?

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Ting.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
Oh, it's Ting.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
That's right.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Go over to Ting and check them out.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
Ting is a little different than anybody else.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
They don't work like your regular cell phone provider.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
Ting keeps rates simple.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
We don't make you pick a plan.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
Instead, you just use your phone as you normally would.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
How much you use determines how much you pay each month.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.000
All right.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
You can have as many devices as you want on one account.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
That's good, because when you use more,

31:44.000 --> 31:47.000
you pay less per minute, message, or megabyte of data.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Is that math right?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Your usage plus $6 per active device on your account

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
plus taxes is your monthly bill.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.000
Yeah, it is.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.000
Simple.

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
That's what we mean when we say mobile.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.000
I get it.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.000
That makes sense.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
Yeah, it's your minutes, your message, your megabytes.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
That's your Ting math.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
And then it's $6 for the line.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
And then whatever Uncle Sam's cut is right there.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
You see, you just got...

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
Wes?

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Boom.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
That is what you get right there.

32:10.000 --> 32:15.000
And I got to tell you, Wes, I was sort of all in on Ting

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
just because of the savings when I switched over.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
I was like, okay, well, that seems obvious.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
I want to pay less every month.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Yeah.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.000
And I have Wi-Fi at home.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
I have Wi-Fi here at the studs.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
I have Wi-Fi at family member's house.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
I have Wi-Fi at, you know, there's Wi-Fi on the bus these days.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
Freaking McDonald's has freaking Wi-Fi.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
So I was like, this is going to be great because I'll be able to game the system.

32:36.000 --> 32:39.000
So that was sort of what brought me over to Ting.

32:39.000 --> 32:42.000
But then what kept me at Ting, the first bit,

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
is I kept having these revelations about how they were actually a really cool company

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
and not just like a bullshit like, we're hip.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
And so we do blog posts.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
No, it's like actually there's really cool people and they really get it.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
And they really are not playing a gimmick.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
They're not playing a game.

32:58.000 --> 33:04.000
They don't have to wear a leather jacket and a pink shirt to get you to be convinced to switch over.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
They just make a really simple mobile service.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Every device they sell is unlocked and you own it.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
The customer support, you get to talk to a real human being.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
The control panel allows you to control all aspects of your phone.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Oh, that control panel is awesome.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.000
It really is super good.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
They're a store.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
You can buy SIM cards.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
You can buy feature phones.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
You can get the latest phones.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
You can bring your own.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
And they have GSM and a CDMA network for you to pick from.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
If you're a small business, this is a no-brainer.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.000
Really, seriously, like independent surveys have been done, conducted.

33:31.000 --> 33:38.000
And not only, by the way, speaking of that, not only does Ting totally kick ass in consumer reports for their category of provider,

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
I got to tell you what, nobody touches them when it comes to small business plans.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.000
If you have like 10 devices and you bring them over, nobody's going to touch Ting.

33:47.000 --> 33:53.000
You go 10 devices and more and it's nuts because it's $6 for each line.

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
A lot of places, the minimum is $15 a line, something like that.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
And in a business account, it could be even more.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
And that's even when they cut in some big scale deals.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
$6 a line.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
One line, 50 lines.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.000
$6.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
If you want to give somebody an emergency phone, it's $6.

34:07.000 --> 34:13.000
CDMA and GSM, which means you can repurpose a lot of your existing phones that still work perfectly fine

34:13.000 --> 34:18.000
or you can find a great phone off of eBay or buy one right from the Ting store.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Go get it from Google Play.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
Great controls, great customer service.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
It's a really good service.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
I think everything about Ting is top and tops.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
And they really do actually have a good blog.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
They constantly are posting interesting stuff there too.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
You can check that out.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
If you start by going to linux.ting.com, you support this show.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
You can try out their savings calculator and just use that as a litmus test.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.000
Does this work for you?

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
It might not.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
And that's why they have the savings calculator.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
You can just figure that out right there.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
You don't need to waste your time or Ting's time.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
Just try the savings calculator.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
That won't take long.

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
Linux.ting.com and then if it does look like it's going to work, like for me, I end up saving like $2,000 every two years.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
Linux.ting.com.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
That's crazy.

34:56.000 --> 35:01.000
Take $25 off your first device or if you bring a device, you'll get service credit, which will probably pay for more than your first month.

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
Linux.ting.com.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
Thank you, Ting.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.000
All right.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
So before we go any further, let's take a little break.

35:08.000 --> 35:12.000
Refresh with a free game.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Oh, is that a Linux game I see?

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Yes, it is.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
And it's a good one too.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
I already own this game.

35:17.000 --> 35:24.000
I got it on sale during the sale, but it's a limbo, which the thing that really stands out about limbo is it's sort of a platformer.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.000
So you have to like the side scrolling platformers, but it's not like a lot of colors and a lot of whiz bang.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
It's beautiful.

35:30.000 --> 35:40.000
It's dark and it's moody and it's mysterious and it uses lighting and shadows in a way that really no other game has ever before or has since.

35:40.000 --> 35:46.000
And it's exceedingly beautiful and also very reasonable to play even like on an Intel chipset.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
And it works great with the controller.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
It's a great SteamOS game.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
It's been out since 2011.

35:51.000 --> 35:56.000
So it's not like it's brand new, but it's one of these overwhelmingly positively reviewed games.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.000
It really is.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
People love it.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
And it's freaking free right now.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
Can't be free.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.000
Yeah.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
If you're listening to the show for the next couple of days, it is free right now and you can find it in the show notes.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
So I think that's just really super cool.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
Look at that.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.000
Did you see that huge creepy spider?

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
That thing is just...

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Man, that always creeps my kids out.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
They love this game because it's slightly creepy.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
So they love that.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.000
All right.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
So I believe Mr. Ikey is in the Mumble Room.

36:20.000 --> 36:25.000
And that just happens to work out great because a brand new release of Solus is out.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
1.2.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
Don't call it 1.2 though.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
Call it Shannon.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
And it is looking good.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.000
I've heard people talk...

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
People have been talking about the boot speed this morning.

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
This is what the chat room is saying this morning as I was setting up.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.000
They say, Wes, that new SolOS sure boots fast.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
I've never seen a distro boot that fast before.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
That's what the chat room is saying.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
So Ikey, you're doing something right.

36:45.000 --> 36:50.000
What's new and notable in the new shiny release?

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
Ikey, I don't hear you.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Did he leave?

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
No.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Ikey, that's your cue.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Somebody bring Ikey back.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
Somebody bring Ikey back.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
I don't even see him.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
Hey, Wes.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Where's Ikey?

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
I don't know.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.000
Jeez, Louise.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
But I do want to give this 1.2 Shannon a try.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
Yeah, it does look nice.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
Although, this is such a good setup to have a fail like that.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
I just feel like now I don't want to talk about it.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
I mean, that was like...

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I think that was my best setup of the show.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
What do you think?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
You think that was my best setup of the show?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
You've peaked, Chris.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Yeah.

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
I think I peaked and then the payoff wasn't there.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Hi.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Sorry.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
The man of the hour.

37:31.000 --> 37:35.000
So how's audio working on SolOS, Ikey?

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
Audio is working fine.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.000
It's great.

37:39.000 --> 37:40.000
It's great.

37:40.000 --> 37:45.000
So it turns out like I spent ages earlier setting up this mouse because it's got all

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
these buttons.

37:46.000 --> 37:50.000
I thought, I'm going to set that mouse button up there and I'm going to use that one for

37:50.000 --> 37:53.000
Mumble and I'm not going to forget which one it is.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.000
There's three of them, not two.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
So I'm here now.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.000
No worries.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
I actually gave me a chance to have a little fun.

38:00.000 --> 38:05.000
So what is the new shiny in the big release here?

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
So I mean, where do we start?

38:07.000 --> 38:13.000
I mean, we're 20 days late and I can only apologize for that to people.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
Oh, so you guys are copying Fedora, huh?

38:16.000 --> 38:17.000
What does it say?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.000
Yeah.

38:18.000 --> 38:23.000
I mean, it basically turned out the same time as them and before Half Life 3.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.000
So I'd say, you know, we're doing all right there.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.000
Yeah, yeah.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.000
It's both a difference.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
It's good.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Yeah.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
I mean, it was later than I anticipated, but I mean, I've not been too well myself lately,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
but we made it.

38:34.000 --> 38:41.000
It represents over three months of work, over 150 bugs fixed, a completely new replacement

38:41.000 --> 38:48.000
Steam runtime and the Linux Steam integration with roughly 160 of the libraries that we've

38:48.000 --> 38:53.000
enabled for Steam now being optimized as well.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
Yeah, we got the epic boot time, obviously.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
It's been a massive, massive release.

38:59.000 --> 39:03.000
So tell me a little bit about this Steam stuff because I got a little wind of this earlier.

39:03.000 --> 39:09.000
And I don't really – I'm not hip with the Steam stuff, but here's my rough understanding

39:09.000 --> 39:17.000
of Nike is if you got all the necessary libraries that all the different games need, if you

39:17.000 --> 39:22.000
use the more modern versions that come with current distros, you often get better performance,

39:22.000 --> 39:28.000
less problems than using the prepackaged Ubuntu runtime libraries that are based on an old

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
version of Ubuntu that come with Steam itself.

39:30.000 --> 39:35.000
And so I guess some people prefer to use the runtime libraries, some people prefer to use

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
native libraries, and you guys have tried to solve this problem.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Am I tracking?

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
Yeah, I mean, that's pretty much it.

39:42.000 --> 39:47.000
I mean, I know that you yourself go between Fedora and Arch and so you've probably seen

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
some of the Steam issues yourself.

39:49.000 --> 39:56.000
On Ubuntu, I mean, people tend to get it easy on Ubuntu up until about 16.04.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
I was going to say 16.10.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
That's not happened yet.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
But these libraries are like from Ubuntu 12.04.

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
So, I mean, in Linux terms, they are crusty.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
These are really, really old libraries that are built specifically for Ubuntu.

40:12.000 --> 40:17.000
I mean, we're talking about libraries that just don't exist in other distributions.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
They've got different soul names.

40:19.000 --> 40:25.000
You've got like curl, GNU, TLS, which are specific Ubuntu and Debian things.

40:25.000 --> 40:30.000
So, what we decided to do is like, okay, one, this is nonsense, right?

40:30.000 --> 40:34.000
We build Solace and we optimize it for our users.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
It's like, okay, so if we're going to have to do some hacks here to get it to work, well,

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
we're going to make sure we do it properly.

40:39.000 --> 40:44.000
So, we took what would constitute the full runtime and just started building everything

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
and disabled Steam from running its own runtime.

40:47.000 --> 40:53.000
So, we've got something called Linux Steam Integration, which basically replaces user bin Steam.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
So, this shim will run instead of that.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
And we made sure it doesn't leak or anything like that.

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
And it replaces itself with the Steam process afterwards.

41:01.000 --> 41:07.000
So, when we disable their runtime and we use ours, you actually get nice integration.

41:07.000 --> 41:11.000
So, you'll actually see things like font config is actually working.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
You get all the right font rendering come through.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
I don't know if you guys have seen it on Archer and other distros, but you'll see the font

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
are ever so slightly out of line.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.000
The buttons along the top of Steam, they're all kind of drunk as well.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
So, it fixes those issues.

41:24.000 --> 41:29.000
The tray will be natively themed as well, which it's those little touches which really,

41:29.000 --> 41:30.000
really help.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
But the main thing really was the performance.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
Those were advantages that came afterwards.

41:35.000 --> 41:42.000
You can disable our runtime and forcibly use Steams because ours is new.

41:42.000 --> 41:45.000
There's going to be things we haven't tested yet.

41:45.000 --> 41:52.000
We were responsible and tested 100 titles in the first 24 hours.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
It was our duty, right?

41:54.000 --> 41:58.000
But that also sounds like a good idea just from, you could see some game developer go,

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
oh yeah, well, that distribution's doing their own weird thing with Steam.

42:03.000 --> 42:07.000
So, that gives the person a reset button to say, okay, well, I'm testing it with the native

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
runtime and I'm still having the problem.

42:09.000 --> 42:10.000
Yeah, that's true.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Yeah, I mean, they can do either way.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
There's even a third option if you like.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
So, one of the games, well, there was two of them.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Counter-Strike Go wasn't working for me.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
I don't remember if you guys saw the update a couple of weeks ago.

42:23.000 --> 42:28.000
Basically, something went wrong when they suddenly switched it to use 64-bit only on

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
CSGO.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
It still shipped with the 32-bit version.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
So, I thought, aha.

42:33.000 --> 42:38.000
So, I added a tweak in there, which you know when you run things via the Linux 32 command

42:38.000 --> 42:42.000
line, it basically forces things into a 32-bit environment.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
So, I added that support inside of LSI.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.000
So, Steam will then be tricked into running only 32-bit versions of the applications.

42:49.000 --> 42:55.000
So, what that does is for CSGO, I'm able to use the native runtime in 32-bit mode.

42:55.000 --> 43:05.000
And for Goat Simulator, a very serious strategy game, you're able to run that in 32-bit with

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
Steam's runtime because that uses some special Nvidia physics libraries.

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
You are doing the Lord's work there.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
That's great.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
It's, you know, somebody's got to do these things, right?

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Why not me?

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
So, that's all coming in, the new update.

43:21.000 --> 43:28.000
And so, along with that, do you package it all up with like an update mechanism or is

43:28.000 --> 43:31.000
it sort of a nuke and pave process?

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
No, I mean, people can update.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
So, in terms of the packages that have already got installed in the system, those will change,

43:39.000 --> 43:40.000
right?

43:40.000 --> 43:43.000
So, whatever updates you got through there, like security updates and things like that,

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
those are going to come through.

43:45.000 --> 43:53.000
Between Solus 1.1 and 1.2, we decided to change how we put certain packages together.

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
New distributions are coming out and they're starting to use Budgie and we thought, well,

43:57.000 --> 44:02.000
maybe those patches we've been doing aren't quite the best approach.

44:02.000 --> 44:07.000
So, we'll try and set an example, show people how you can actually ship a distribution or

44:07.000 --> 44:12.000
an operating system just to be pedantic and show them how you can actually have all the

44:12.000 --> 44:15.000
presets in place and how you do the configuration.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.000
So, we added a couple of packages.

44:16.000 --> 44:22.000
One of them is Solus Hardware Config, which takes care of certain mouse configurations

44:22.000 --> 44:27.000
like the RAT5 mouse and things like this and Budgie Desktop Branding, which contains all

44:27.000 --> 44:32.000
of the live CD configuration and all the tweaks that are needed for Gsens for basically the

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Budgie experience we now offer.

44:34.000 --> 44:38.000
So, those don't come through as an update.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
They're basically going to have to be opt-in.

44:40.000 --> 44:45.000
So, the package selection is very much dependent on the ISO you downloaded.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
You can upgrade and install those things as well.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.000
But if you're already in 1.1, you'll just get the normal updates that come through.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
Of course, you're still going to get all the optimizations that come through for all the

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
lower libraries as well.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
So, you will still benefit.

44:58.000 --> 45:04.000
It just won't look exactly the same or won't have exactly the same software installed.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
It's easy to do, though.

45:05.000 --> 45:10.000
That sounds like a lot of thought is going into every single thing about this release.

45:10.000 --> 45:17.000
Is there something that you work on that you think a lot about that you assume probably

45:17.000 --> 45:18.000
people don't even notice?

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
Like, is there something in here that people miss?

45:20.000 --> 45:21.000
Like, what is it?

45:21.000 --> 45:27.000
Like, I always know when there's something I work on, there's something that I just sweat

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
the details on.

45:28.000 --> 45:33.000
And then after I'm done, I'm like, did anybody actually even notice that?

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
Yeah.

45:34.000 --> 45:39.000
Well, I mean, it's going to be that way for me for a lot of things.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
I mean, you know yourself.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
Once you put something out, like you say, you sweat on something, it's not so much when

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
someone doesn't notice that as they notice something far more insignificant.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Yeah.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
And that's the killer.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
So, I mean, not as insignificant.

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
So, we've had a bit of a UX update.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
We've actually been lucky enough.

45:58.000 --> 46:04.000
I mean, I think you guys know yourselves, but the guy behind the Arc theme, Horst3180,

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
we've worked directly with him for a long time now.

46:07.000 --> 46:10.000
And with him, we actually just redesigned the budget desktop.

46:10.000 --> 46:15.000
And that's how budget desktop 10 came around, like designed by the theme author.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
Wow.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.000
Yeah.

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
So, like it was actually called Arc Desktop for a long time.

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
Yeah.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.000
Okay.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.000
That was the code name.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
He's helped us a lot more with getting things together this time.

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
And we now have the Arc icon theme as well.

46:27.000 --> 46:32.000
So, within 40 minutes of it having a Git repo, it was the default in Solus.

46:32.000 --> 46:35.000
He'd be on all the cards for a while.

46:35.000 --> 46:40.000
Sam Hewitt has also helped us a lot with UX design this time around.

46:40.000 --> 46:44.000
I mean, you all know Sam.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
Sam, I don't know.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
I probably know him by a handle.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
I probably don't know him by Sam.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
So, Sam Hewitt, the guy behind the paper theme.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
Oh, okay.

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Yeah, yeah, okay.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.000
Yeah, that guy.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
Right?

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
That guy.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
Yeah.

46:57.000 --> 47:01.000
So, he's helped us with designing the software center, giving like little hints and tips

47:01.000 --> 47:05.000
and fixes and mock-ups for that, as well as the installer itself.

47:05.000 --> 47:10.000
So, how has adoption been?

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
Adoption?

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
I haven't a clue.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.000
When did we release?

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
Early yesterday?

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Well, I just mean as a whole.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
I don't mean one particular release.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
I mean, as a community, you get a sense that there's growth there, that things are picking

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
up.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
But what is your sense?

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
Yeah, I mean, definitely.

47:25.000 --> 47:29.000
There's a lot of people really now starting to get it.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
I mean, Solus goes against the grain in so many ways.

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
And it's never easy to explain exactly in one sentence to people.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
It's like, you know, this is what Solus does.

47:38.000 --> 47:43.000
And they're like, well, why not use Ubuntu, Stora, Debian, insert something here?

47:43.000 --> 47:50.000
It's like, because kill me if you want, but I don't think it works.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
We have to do some...

47:51.000 --> 47:54.000
There's so many things that we do that are so fundamentally different that we couldn't

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
do as a downstream.

47:56.000 --> 48:00.000
So, explaining those things, but people are now realizing that.

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
And you do see comments now.

48:01.000 --> 48:05.000
People are like, I can actually see why you did this from scratch.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
Like it was designed to avoid the problems in the first place.

48:08.000 --> 48:14.000
Like, it's not like we're somehow superior to or holier than other people.

48:14.000 --> 48:18.000
We've taken that experience, and I've taken my own experience in doing this as well, and

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
folded it into something new.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.000
That's pretty cool.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
And I think it always, after we chat, it always makes me want to download it.

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
So, I'll download the new release and give it an install.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
I'm looking forward to that.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
So, I always like using something.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
There's a lot of thought and intention that goes into it.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.000
Yeah.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.000
Well, Aiki, thanks for the update.

48:36.000 --> 48:43.000
Anything else you want to touch on?

48:43.000 --> 48:44.000
Maybe that crazy mouse?

48:44.000 --> 48:45.000
I don't know.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
Okay.

48:46.000 --> 48:50.000
No, I mean, no, because it only fires things up.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
You are welcome to stick around.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I know, I think I saw you mention something on Google+.

48:54.000 --> 48:58.000
You're getting lots of questions about snaps in Solace.

48:58.000 --> 49:01.000
So, if you want to stick around for that discussion coming up in a few minutes, you are welcome.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.000
Okay.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
I'll bite.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
Excellent.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Just really quick, I just wanted to give a mention because it's happening right now as

49:08.000 --> 49:09.000
we record the show.

49:09.000 --> 49:13.000
DockerCon is going on, and they're integrating something that I'm hoping Wes can explain

49:13.000 --> 49:17.000
to me what it is, because I think it's kind of a big deal.

49:17.000 --> 49:23.000
Docker is integrating orchestration right into the core Docker engine with their new

49:23.000 --> 49:24.000
release.

49:24.000 --> 49:27.000
This is some of the big news that's coming out of DockerCon going on in Seattle.

49:27.000 --> 49:32.000
So, Wes, you've seen probably some of the shenanigans as a result of DockerCon.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
I've certainly seen a lot of people with really cute little whales walking around, which,

49:35.000 --> 49:36.000
hey, that's not bad.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Yeah.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.000
So, you've probably seen all of the DockerCon traffic.

49:40.000 --> 49:45.000
So, container orchestration, if I'm understanding what that there means, Wes, now, you'll have

49:45.000 --> 49:46.000
to forgive me.

49:46.000 --> 49:51.000
I haven't been a sys admin for a couple of years now, but that's another fancy way of

49:51.000 --> 49:55.000
saying like a framework to manage all of your containers and spin them up on different machines

49:55.000 --> 50:00.000
and shut them down and delete them and version them and standardize them and things like

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
that, correct?

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
Yeah.

50:02.000 --> 50:06.000
So, it's like, as they say here, container orchestration is what is needed to transition

50:06.000 --> 50:10.000
from deploying containers individually on a single host to deploying complex multi-container

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
apps on many machines.

50:11.000 --> 50:12.000
Yeah, okay.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.000
So, yeah, as you're growing your cloud, maybe you're on other people's infrastructure, you're

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
on your own infrastructure, you need something that will help you take your single little

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
Docker instances and actually scale them, make sure they fit into the roles, integrate

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
with your configuration management.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
There's a lot of ways to do this and now there's something built right into Docker.

50:27.000 --> 50:30.000
I can even see a scenario where you have four or five digital ocean droplets that you spin

50:30.000 --> 50:35.000
up containers on demand for, like I would just be playing with Fedora 23 today.

50:35.000 --> 50:40.000
So, to me, it seems like what Docker just announced is they're going to take a huge

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
part of the Docker ecosystem and integrate it into the core functionality of Docker.

50:44.000 --> 50:47.000
Like, last time I was at DockerCon was last year around this time.

50:47.000 --> 50:56.000
It was LinuxCon DockerCon and the number one industry at DockerCon is container management

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
and orchestration of containers.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.000
And they just announced they're integrating that into the core.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
I read about it.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
It's some badass stuff.

51:06.000 --> 51:12.000
It allows you to do swarms of Docker containers with just a couple of commands and set up

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
clustered Docker containers with a few more commands and you don't really have to really

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
worry about any of the, quote unquote, you don't have to worry about it, quote unquote,

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
underlying technology.

51:21.000 --> 51:26.000
And they're building that in the core Docker using just a Docker command line.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
I mean, this is like a massive thing.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
Right.

51:29.000 --> 51:30.000
So, we'll probably see it rolling out and everywhere.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
I haven't played with it yet, so it'll be interesting.

51:31.000 --> 51:35.000
I don't know how we'll see, like, will other people adopt it, will it be wrapped around

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
by other systems like Kubernetes or all that kind of stuff?

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
Right.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
Yeah.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.000
That's a good point.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
So, we'll just be watching and see what happens.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
I don't know.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
That's probably all we really need to talk about here on this show, I imagine.

51:45.000 --> 51:46.000
I don't know.

51:46.000 --> 51:47.000
But I'm sure there's lots of news.

51:47.000 --> 51:48.000
I looked over the talks.

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
There's a lot of interesting stuff.

51:50.000 --> 51:54.000
Microsoft's giving a talk about how the containers on Windows are going, if that's your thing.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
You know what I really don't like about them?

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
So, I've been following the DockerCon thing just to see if there's stuff for us to talk

51:58.000 --> 51:59.000
about.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
And so, I saw the Microsoft talk.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
And you know what the really arrogant thing about the Microsoft talk was?

52:04.000 --> 52:08.000
Is Microsoft positioned their entire talk as, well, now that Microsoft's getting involved

52:08.000 --> 52:13.000
with Docker containers, now Docker's coming to the enterprise.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
Now it's production ready.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Now Docker's production ready.

52:16.000 --> 52:20.000
Meanwhile, those SOBs are running it in a virtualizer on their Windows platform.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
It's not even a true container.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Like, they're such a bunch of posers.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
They're so desperate to make their Windows platform relevant that they're bending over

52:27.000 --> 52:33.000
backwards to make Linux containers run on their platform as easy and thinly as possible

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
using their virtualizer.

52:34.000 --> 52:40.000
And then, they have the sack to say, well, now Docker's arrived at the enterprise.

52:40.000 --> 52:44.000
I will say the Mac support is kind of neat, just that they're using XHive, which is ported

52:44.000 --> 52:47.000
over from our friends at FreeBSD, which is pretty neat.

52:47.000 --> 52:50.000
Isn't it interesting to see one of the first things that Beehive does in a large production

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
scale is bring Docker containers to the Mac.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.

52:56.000 --> 52:57.000
Full circle, everyone.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
Full circle.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
Welcome to BSD Unplugged.

52:59.000 --> 53:00.000
You know, it's just one of those things.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
It just happens.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.000
Okay, so.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
Oh, man.

53:04.000 --> 53:11.000
Yeah, you know, speaking of Beehive, it just got Windows video support, so you can VNC

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
into that thing.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
You don't have to do it over a serial console.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
Yeah.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
That's a big usability win.

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
Speaking of DigitalOcean, let's take a moment and talk about DigitalOcean.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
You've got a container you want to deploy.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
Do it over at DigitalOcean.

53:22.000 --> 53:28.000
Now, we've been talking about Docker, but Wes here, you do LXD containers in production

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
on DigitalOcean.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.000
And what do you like about the LXD containers over the Docker containers?

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Well, you know, they're just a little more familiar.

53:34.000 --> 53:38.000
I mean, Docker works well if I was, you know, making maybe like a big fleet of microservices

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
and using orchestration tools and that sort of thing.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
Docker may be something I would look to be using.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
LXD containers are nice because they really act a lot more like VMs, which is something

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
I'm familiar with.

53:49.000 --> 53:52.000
And I get all of my regular Linux tools for admin, right?

53:52.000 --> 53:56.000
So, like, I know how to use like SystemD and journal control and all that kind of stuff

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
to manage services, et cetera.

53:58.000 --> 54:02.000
It's all the same tools, and then I can just spin them up, transfer them from server to

54:02.000 --> 54:03.000
server.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.000
So, it's simpler in some regards.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.000
Make copies, take snapshots.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
It's very simple.

54:06.000 --> 54:09.000
And if you don't need a huge enterprise-grade thing, you just want a few containers.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
Yeah.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
You know, I basically set up a system, turn it into an image.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
I can then just update the image when I need to.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
I can transfer it and then just make as many images as I want.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
Are there LXD container images like there are Docker?

54:20.000 --> 54:25.000
Like, could I go grab a pre-setup LXD container to be lazy, or does it pretty much build it

54:25.000 --> 54:26.000
from scratch each time?

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
Well, so they are like actual image files, right?

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
So, like, they're tarred up file systems.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Okay.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
So, they send these on the file system as an image.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.000
Oh, okay.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
And then are there – is there like a place you can find pre-built ones?

54:37.000 --> 54:38.000
Yeah.

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
So, they have like a repository, and then you can also – the nice part is that they

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
all have a REST API, and then they'll all just – you can like – if you have your

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
own, you can then share images with any two servers that you want to let talk to each

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
other.

54:48.000 --> 54:49.000
Oh.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
It's also really easy to make.

54:50.000 --> 54:53.000
Like, you pretty much just take any install that you want, and you can trim it down,

54:53.000 --> 54:56.000
you know, uninstall packages or build it up minimally.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.000
And then the format's really easy.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
It's like you make two tar files.

54:58.000 --> 54:59.000
One's metadata.

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
One's the file system.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.000
You run, like, load it into an image.

55:02.000 --> 55:03.000
That's nice.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
And then you can use it.

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
So, what's the process like of getting LXD running on a droplet on DigitalOcean?

55:08.000 --> 55:12.000
Well, use like Ubuntu 16.04 when it's there by default, and then –

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
Oh, so it's like sex.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
Type LXC.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
Yeah, right.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.000
Pretty much, right?

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
Type LXC, and then it generates a client certificate, and then you can get started and –

55:19.000 --> 55:20.000
Nice.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
So, you can pretty much do like LXC launch Ubuntu, I think.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
Huh.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
You know, I think I'm going to play with that for a bit, because I was messing around

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
with Docker, but I was on Fedora.

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
But I was messing around with Docker, and it did feel like it was way more than I needed,

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
really.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.000
So, that's interesting that you say that.

55:36.000 --> 55:41.000
So, you go over to DigitalOcean, and if you use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED – DOUNPLUGGED,

55:41.000 --> 55:45.000
one word lowercase – that'll give us a little bit of support, a little bit of like,

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
hey, yeah, that unplugged show is sending traffic our way.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
That keeps us going.

55:49.000 --> 55:53.000
But it also gives you a $10 credit, and you can try out like a droplet for a while.

55:53.000 --> 55:59.000
They have hourly pricing, so the droplet you may use may not need to be on all the time.

55:59.000 --> 56:03.000
And then that $5 – or they have a $5 a month if you want to just run it for a month or

56:03.000 --> 56:04.000
whatever.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
Like, they have a really flexible pricing structure.

56:05.000 --> 56:09.000
So, the $10 credit could actually get you quite a bit of distance.

56:09.000 --> 56:12.000
All their rigs have SSDs, so it's a nice, fast I.O.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
They have data centers all over the world.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
They run Linux for the host.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
KVM for the virtualizer.

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
40 gigabit connections into the hypervisors.

56:22.000 --> 56:27.000
Tier 1 bandwidth at the data centers and the best interface.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
I mean – and it's not even like a good interface for a web application.

56:30.000 --> 56:33.000
It is a good interface for managing this.

56:33.000 --> 56:39.000
You know what was sweet is today when I was – I decided to install a whole bunch of

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
crap on this Fedora droplet that I have.

56:42.000 --> 56:49.000
And it was really super, super nice to just go in there and have the HTML5 console pop

56:49.000 --> 56:50.000
up.

56:50.000 --> 56:55.000
And I was able to watch the console spit out information while I'm SSHed in.

56:55.000 --> 57:01.000
So, my SSH session feels fast and native and just – in fact, sometimes I even use Mosh.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
Oh, yeah.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
Totally.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.000
Yeah.

57:04.000 --> 57:05.000
Which really makes it feel like I'm sitting right there.

57:05.000 --> 57:10.000
But then to still have like the – to have it in a separate window on my second monitor,

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
the console of the droplet is just the best, dude.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
I love the –

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
You know if you break anything.

57:15.000 --> 57:16.000
It's just right there.

57:16.000 --> 57:22.000
And it took four seconds to reassign a DNS hostname to the Fedora.

57:22.000 --> 57:25.000
It's like I was like, you know, I want to change the name of this Fedora machine.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
So, I used hostctl, hostnamectl or whatever it is.

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
Is that hostnamectl to set the hostname?

57:30.000 --> 57:33.000
And I set the machine name and the icon name.

57:33.000 --> 57:38.000
And then in DigitalOcean, I just copy and paste just because over the interface, when

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
you hover over the IP, it gives you the option to copy the IP right.

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
So, boom, boom, pasted, updated the A record, and because the DNS was already pointing to

57:46.000 --> 57:50.000
DigitalOcean's name servers, it was SSHed immediately.

57:50.000 --> 57:51.000
And I was up and working.

57:51.000 --> 57:54.000
I'm installing, just experimenting.

57:54.000 --> 58:00.000
I'm hoping to eventually get like a nice secure open source location tracking program that

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
we can have for family members.

58:02.000 --> 58:05.000
And also when production – like during Linux Fest, we can have like crew members install

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
it if they want.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.000
Totally.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
They're on their way.

58:08.000 --> 58:09.000
Yeah, exactly.

58:09.000 --> 58:12.000
But I don't want to use any hosted service, and so I wanted a rig to try these out on.

58:12.000 --> 58:16.000
And to be able to install these different packages and stuff, the faster you're going

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
to access that HTML5 console, it's a great setup.

58:18.000 --> 58:19.000
Plus, you can take snapshots if you need to.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.000
I did.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
If you're worried about breaking it, you're just like, boom.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.000
I did.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.000
Peace of mind.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
Yep.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
DO Unplugged to get the credit and support this show.

58:26.000 --> 58:30.000
So, tell me about Meru, which seems to promise real big, Wes.

58:30.000 --> 58:36.000
For those of you out there that aren't familiar with it, their tagline is, your phone is your

58:36.000 --> 58:37.000
PC.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
Now available for the Nexus 5, it's a new kind of computing experience.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
We've talked about it in the past.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.000
It's based on Debian, and supposedly it's context aware.

58:45.000 --> 58:50.000
You plug it into a big monitor, and boom, you get a big old Linux desktop.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.000
Is it true?

58:51.000 --> 58:55.000
In my experience so far, I mean, it hasn't been perfect, and I haven't tried it extensively,

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
but I do have it running right here on my phone.

58:57.000 --> 59:01.000
So, is it an app on Android that runs in a virtual environment?

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
I mean, so is that Android I'm seeing right now, or is that the phone UI?

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
That's Android, but that's Meru OS.

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
So, it looks just like what we're seeing in the video right now, is exactly what I'm seeing.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
I have multi-ROM, so I just booted right into it.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.000
So, this is Meru OS running Android?

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
I think it is Android.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
I thought it was Debian-based.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
It may just launch through Debian, New Zealand.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
I'm not actually sure how it works.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
Okay, so how do I initiate a different desktop experience?

59:25.000 --> 59:28.000
Unfortunately, I don't think we can without the right cable, which I do have.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.000
That makes sense.

59:29.000 --> 59:32.000
So, if we want to set up a demo, I can film it and upload it.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
Yeah, I see what you're saying.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Because, of course, you'd have to plug it in, right?

59:35.000 --> 59:40.000
But you plug it in, and it just, you know, XFCE desktop launches.

59:40.000 --> 59:44.000
You need like a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, which I tested.

59:44.000 --> 59:50.000
There's some problems, and I did run into this, where the Bluetooth mouse is like a little laggy.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
They suggest just turning it off and on or turning Bluetooth off and on.

59:53.000 --> 59:54.000
That did not fix it for me.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
I have not been able to fix it, but I have not tried that much.

59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
So, it may already be fixed, or it may just be something I need to configure.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
But the keyboard worked perfectly.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
It was otherwise, it was like fast, it was responsive.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000
I've seen some videos of people using Blender, using GIMP.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:17.000
So, it appears to be running Android 5.1, and it says is Maru on the Nexus 5 is the version, version 0.2.3.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Kernel version 3.4.0, GEAA 8415.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And so, it's very much right now a pure Android experience.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
So, it does mean you've now had to downgrade from Marshmallow to Android 5.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:40.000
But in exchange, without a reboot, you plug in the HDMI cable to this son of a gun,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:46.000
and you're telling me it instantly expands to an XFCE desktop.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Because this is not an XFCE launcher on the phone right now.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
And what happens on the phone screen?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
It stays, you can use the phone too.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
You can use both at the same time.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000
So, Android remains running on the phone.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Yep.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
So, it must be an Android app then.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
And so, you usually just want it to go fall asleep.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
What do they call that?

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Doze?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Yeah.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
And so, it'll keep everything on.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Otherwise, if you explicitly lock it, it can sometimes trigger the screen saver in the other window.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
But otherwise, it really works very well.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
So, in what scenario could this actually be practical?

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Because here we are, you wanted to show it to me, and yet, without the hardware, you can't actually do anything.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
So, you have to have the cable.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Everywhere.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000
You have to have the port cable.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Everywhere you go, you'd have to have somewhere to plug that into.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Yep.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
So, you also have to have an external monitor ready to go.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
And a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000
Yep.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Those two are fairly easy, and I suppose you might have them anyway if you have a tablet or something.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:42.000
This is starting to seem extremely, I mean, now that you actually have to live with this in practice,

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000
all the dependencies to actually be able to use this as a desktop machine is really kind of making it limited.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Because at some point, you're going to go, well, I could also just go get a Chromebook.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
You could just get a Chromebook, especially now that they're running the Android apps.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Yeah.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
You know, and I haven't tried it that much, and you are kind of surrendering, like,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
if you're not going to go to the trouble of having a computer and you're just using your phone,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:11.000
and you bring your phone to work, and then you plug your phone into your keyboard and monitor,

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
then you're left with the computing power of the phone.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Here's what I would rather have for me.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:21.000
I would rather have a really easy image that allows me to run Google's version of Android

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
so I can get my monthly security updates.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
That's why I buy a Nexus phone.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000
And then I would like something like multi-ROM, but maybe like a fork of it or something,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:35.000
that easily reboots me into another OS that can still access the Android data or something to that degree.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Oh, yeah.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Because I don't want to forfeit having modern Android.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
At the same time, it's probably only, now that you mention this,

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
it's only like a couple of work case scenarios.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
At best, Wes, you could have a dock and a keyboard and a mouse at work,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.000
and a dock and a keyboard and a mouse at home, and you could go between home and work.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:00.000
But it's not like you're going to go to a coffee shop and use it.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
You're not coming here to the studio and using it unless you put a dock here.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Really, at a certain point, the overhead of having to just reboot into a dedicated OS

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
that is designed for a desktop computer, I don't know.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
And all I'm doing is using my phone all day, which is like,

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
I have a lot more powerful computers I'd probably want to use.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
But it is an interesting idea.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
And the performance is better than you thought.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
I mean, XFCE doesn't really need that much, but it was working fine.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I haven't installed a lot.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I haven't tried taxing it.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I'm going to try to play with it more this weekend.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Anybody in the Mumble Room have any questions for Wes's test drive with Maroo OS?

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I guess, yeah, NorthRanger, you were going to say, what's the point of having to reboot?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Yeah, I mean, Android is running a Linux kernel.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Is it really that much overhead having the extra Android user land kind of shoved to the side

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:54.000
if you're ultimately booting up an X server and running a desktop shell anyway?

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Probably not.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
It probably depends on how they do it.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I'll have to do some more research to see what I can find out.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
And it only supports the Nexus 5 at this point, which is kind of a bummer because...

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Yeah, I mean, I like it.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000
It's working for me, but it's definitely feeling old.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Yeah.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.000
So does this change your anticipation at all one way or the other for a Ubuntu phone?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
So you mentioned getting the OnePlus 3 because, you know, you were thinking maybe upgrading in the future.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Yeah, I'm thinking about that, yeah.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Now that you've tried this, has this chilled your opinion of convergence at all?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000
I mean, I think I'm still waiting for, like you said, I'm waiting for the real use case in my life.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I did have a really powerful device, and I did have, you know...

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
There's just a lot of things to bring around.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
You can't carry a screen, a keyboard, and a mouse with you and the cable everywhere you go.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
One use case I could maybe think of is, like, my wife, for instance, she's an artist,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
so she has a little Cintiq small screen that she carries around with her.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
That might be something, if you could connect it to something like that,

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000
where you're already carrying around a screen for some reason, maybe in that case, but that's pretty niche.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
N3, you had a question?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Yeah, is it running mirror?

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Oh yeah, did we figure out what the Linux display manager was?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
I didn't see anything on their website about it.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
There's not that much information on the website.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
There is a Google group for development.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Yeah, I don't think they actually have the info,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
but we will link to the page if you guys want to dig through it.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
And then I saw JM, you had a question.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
JMBBBBZ, go ahead.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
BBZ.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Yeah, can you make phone calls and text and things when you're in desktop mode, when you're docked?

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000
I have not tried a phone call, but texting, I've been using other apps.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
That stuff all seems to work fine.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Yeah, it's the full Android OS.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
So if people have more questions, too, I'll be happy to film a little thing

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
or film me using it or stress testing it if there's things people want me to try.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Is it Google Apps on there?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Not yet. It's pretty minimal.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000
It looks like here I'm reading a thread right now on how to get the Google Apps on there, though.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
In fact, it's interesting.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
It's kind of revealing on how they do this.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Does it feel kind of snappy when you're using it in desktop mode,

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
or does it feel like you're running off a phone?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
It really didn't feel very laggy.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000
I mean, the mouse was lagging a little bit, but I pulled up a terminal, I was browsing the web.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
That part wasn't laggy at all.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.000
It is. There is. Oh, boy.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000
You know, the Motorola laptop is really the best scenario.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
That's really what you need is something like that.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
You can still find them on eBay every now and then, but that would make that.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
If you had something that was in your bag that was lightweight,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
that extra battery, LCD screen and a keyboard.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Yes, exactly. They're out there.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
You should have the Motorola laptops out there.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000
All right, so any other notes on the Meru or any other questions?

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
No? All right.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Then we shall move forward because I do want to talk about the snaps and flat packs here for a second.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
But before we go any further, let's take a moment and thank Linux Academy.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
LinuxAcademy.com is where you go.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
That's a platform to learn more about Linux and the technology around it.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Not just Linux itself, although that's a huge part of Linux Academy,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
and not just the core essentials and all the expert things around it.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Yes, all that stuff. Yes, it's true. It's true.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
But also a lot of projects built around it.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:14.000
So things like Ruby or things like NGINX or things that are tangently related,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.000
like the entire OpenStack setup or Amazon Web Services.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000
This is all different aspects. And even to that end,

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:29.000
now Linux Academy is introducing Microsoft Azure Essentials.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
How about that? Because you know what?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Azure is a competitive cloud computing platform that runs a whole ton of Linux.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
That's right.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Yeah. And so they've launched a courseware on that, which I think is pretty awesome.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
And they've also recently launched a new social note card system

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000
where you can fork note cards and get really good learning stacks.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000
They have scenario-based labs that put you in the middle of everyday comment day tasks.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
They have instructor mentoring, which is slick,

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
and also a little bit of secret sauce,

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
and the graded server exercises for those of us who just don't test so well.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000
It's nice knowing, like, getting some verification, right?

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000
You're just like, yes, I actually did learn that thing.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
That's me shaking because I was taking a test.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Yeah, it's really nice.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000
It's a good platform stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
And if you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, you get a great discount.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000
I love the fact that they spin up a server on demand that you get to SSH in

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
just as the courseware calls for it.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
You choose the distro.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000
It modifies the courseware and the machine they spin up, which is nice.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
And the other thing is, and, boy, I could have used this a few years ago,

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
is if you're learning some of the Amazon Web Services stuff,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
they're managing all of that for you so you don't have surprise bills.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
You don't have to worry about their complicated setup.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
You don't have to, like, go get your boss to give you the credit cards.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
That way they can pay for it.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000
None of that, it's all just built into the Linux Academy courseware.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Check it out, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
All right, guys.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000
So we have the official announcement that Flatpaks were released this week.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
And I thought since it's newsworthy, it came out literally today,

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
it's worth talking about here on the Unplugged show.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:08.000
And I don't know where to go with this without just putting it all out there.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
And hopefully people...

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:19.000
So on the Linux Action Show, by the time we got to the Linux Action Show on Sunday,

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000
people had really, really, like, drawn a line in the sand

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.000
and picked a side in the new universal packaging war.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:37.000
And there was a full-on response, a lot of it from the Red Hat folks,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:42.000
about Canonical's PR strategy.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:48.000
And there was some attacks, some of which we covered in the Linux Action Show.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
And it got really kind of ugly fast.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000
A lot of focusing on the PR initiative.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
A lot of talk about how they use distribution names.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
I think, you know, that is worth thinking about and having a discussion about.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I think that is a fair discussion.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
But I was really disappointed to see they didn't go after the technical merits.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Yeah, that's what I'm most interested in.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000
I wanted to take a moment, though, and just point something out

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:20.000
that really rubbed me the wrong way once I came to the realization.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.000
A lot of the posts on the mailing lists, on the blogs, on Twitter,

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.000
even today, actually, I'm still seeing them even today,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
about how Canonical is manipulating the PR in this.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
One of the Fedora mailing lists developers, they said,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Canonical beat us to the marketing punch.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:47.000
And then they focused on this aspect so much that I realized what bothered me about it

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
is, Wes, can you do a, do you have a web browser on that?

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I sure do.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Can you go to opensource.com for me?

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I'll go there with you, too.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Let's all go there.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Opensource.com.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Yeah, let's give them some traffic.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
How would you describe opensource.com, Wes?

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
I do see a big, friendly Red Hat right in the top right corner.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
This is, opensource.com is an extremely valuable domain name.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Now, especially, picture the outsider coming into the Linux ecosystem

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
wanting to learn more about open source.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000
This has got to be one of the biggest pieces of real estate in Linux

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000
in the open source ecosystem, opensource.com.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
This is an outfit that is funded by Red Hat

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.000
damn near all of the writers write for or are employed by Red Hat.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000
The ones that don't are Red Hat friendly.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
I mean, no disrespect to the people.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000
I know some of them that run this, and they're fine people.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:48.000
But this is literally, this is literally one of several propaganda fronts

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:57.000
that Red Hat finances to gently nudge the news coverage in the Linux ecosystem

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:05.000
on a fucking hourly basis.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I just, this company is among many tech companies that makes and establishes

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.000
PR outlets, works with journalists, hires Red Hat friendly people to write things.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000
This is something that all of them do.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000
And I understand that the Fedora project is not directly hooked up to Red Hat,

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
but let's be honest, it's a Red Hat project.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:34.000
So to come after Canonical for just having a successful PR launch,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
should they have name dropped distributions?

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Maybe, maybe not.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.000
I think you could quibble about that.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Should have Mark Shuttleworth taken a pot shot at Flatpak saying that

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
95% of contributions come from one person?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.000
No, I don't think so.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:53.000
But you can't fault them for working with different outlets,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.000
for doing interviews, for people behind the scenes working with projects,

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
making sure they understand the SNAP package format,

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000
troubleshooting problems they run into, directly outreaching to work with them.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.000
That's not manipulation.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000
And see, if you read some of the posts, they all essentially go like this.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Canonical manipulated the PR.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
They didn't want to go with somebody else's technology.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
And the conclusion is, if they really wanted to make this a community effort,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
they should have come around and talked to us all.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
They didn't follow the process.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000
They didn't follow the rule.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000
That's the same line of thinking that prevents women from joining different

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000
groups and industries or singles out minorities.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
They didn't follow the process.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
They didn't go through the proper channels.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
It is a contribution that happens organically.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Everybody treats it like it's some master Shuttleworth plan.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Like Mark Shuttleworth is up in his moon tower up there plotting the global

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:56.000
dominance of Linux and his master plan is to manipulate the tech press and get

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:01.000
them to all orchestrate his brand new package format so that way he can declare

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:05.000
dominance and earn all of the millions of dollars by coming up with this technology.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:11.000
And so when Canonical releases something, instead of going after it on its

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:18.000
technical merits, we go after it on the evil Canonical once again trying to drop

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
something in our laps just like Upstart and Mir.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000
It's all part of Shuttleworth's master plan.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
It just gets so old.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:34.000
And the constant attacks on the PR are so unfounded.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.000
And the Linux Foundation is just as guilty.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:44.000
They also have donor friendly writers who write puff pieces and don't even

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:48.000
disclaim it's being financed by these companies.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Again, manipulation.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Go ahead.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.000
The Flatpak thing was interesting because they were saying that Ubuntu was not

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.000
working with the community and they're trying to build this stuff because the

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
whole not invented here thing except for the fact that Snap was created first and

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
the Flatpak is the actual not invented here.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Do we really even care which win was created when?

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Because it seems like...

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
No, we don't care.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
It's just what they're saying.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.000
But the more important part is that they're saying these things about how...

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:27.000
When he was saying that 95% of the work, he probably didn't actually tally it up,

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
but the people who were saying it was not 95, it's 75.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
That's a significant number still.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000
You're caring about a percentage that's not that big of a deal.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
It's 100% canonical contributors to Snap and SnapD.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I mean, really.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000
At the end of the day, there's a Red Hat initiative and there's a canonical

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
initiative.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
To be honest with you...

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000
I think his point was it was 100%.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000
I think he was saying not necessarily it was 95 Red Hat, it was 95 one person.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
I think what's interesting about the Snap initiative is the work to get it on the

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000
other distributions, a lot of that was community driven.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:04.000
People were interested in getting Snap packages on their distribution,

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
so they put the work in.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Again, it wasn't some sort of canonical master plan.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Once there was momentum, canonical pushed some of the final bits into piece,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
made things work, did the outreach.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I mean, in their interest, for sure.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000
That absolutely makes sense, but you can honestly see how this was an organic,

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.000
like, well, let's create something that solves our problem.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
Oh, there's some interest here.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Well, if there's interest here, we just have to do this, this, this, and then now...

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Okay.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
I mean, you could almost see how it just fell in their lap.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.000
Like, they're lucky in some sense, and yet it's from their own doing.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000
But the reaction is it's part of this master strategy, and that mentality that

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
comes out brings us all to war, and then everybody picks their side.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.000
And I intentionally, in the Linux action show, was like, there's a lot of different

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
technologies here.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I don't know which one's going to work.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
I think security sucks on all of them right now, and I just think this solution

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
is inevitable at some point.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000
That was my core point in the Linux action show, and I got emails,

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
you have to stop ranting.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
That was a horrible rant.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
Chris is supporting Snap Pack.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Chris is a Flatpak yes man.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Like, that's just stupid crap that I can't even believe.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Everyone knows you're for app image.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000
I mean, come on.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
I just don't care.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Yeah, right.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
I mean, we just need a successful technology.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Hopefully, we can all figure it out without too much of the same thing.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.000
So with that said, Flatpak, I think, is an interesting solution.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000
Yeah, totally.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:32.000
I'm a little uncertain that it's going to be the long-term winner for a couple

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
of reasons.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.000
It's very desktop focused, and that's a point I meant to mention in the Linux

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:43.000
action show, where snaps are definitely more designed for server, Internet of

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Things devices, and desktops.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.000
And if you think about the huge ass server market, just having all of the

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
momentum that snaps just – okay, how can I say this?

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
You know what I'm trying to say, Wes.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000
Because snaps are going to support server installations, there's just going to be

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000
more snaps by raw numbers right there.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000
There will be just way more snaps because it supports server stuff and because it

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.000
works on Ubuntu than app image is probably ever just right there.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.000
And then the fact that – I would think there's going to be so many people

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
familiar with creating snap packages for the server that there's going to be a

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
lot of knowledge sharing that is going to just sort of, I think, be a snowball

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.000
effect for snaps.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Well, and that makes a lot of sense, too, with how Popi was talking last week

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
about how it works with how they're mounting that at boot time.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000
So everything will be there.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:36.000
You can just spin up an Ubuntu droplet, install your snap, and now you're running

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.000
your binary with all the dependencies handled for you, and it's super easy,

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000
right?

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000
J6 points out in the chat room that after the Linux action show, the blog I was

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
reading – Adam's blog I was reading.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000
I like Adam.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I think he's a nice guy.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
The blog I was reading, he updated his post to say, oh, and I guess there's this

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
thing called AppImage.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:54.000
They weren't even aware of AppImage.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Okay.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.000
So maybe there's something to say, like, was enough prior research done?

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Maybe not.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.000
I don't know.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
I wanted to see – I wanted to give – oh, go ahead.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Go ahead and start.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Let's start.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Let's go in the mobile room.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000
So the AppImage thing is funny because AppImage has been around the longest.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Yeah.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
And there's, like, project shipping with AppImages right now.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
One of them by the creator of the kernel we all speak about all the time.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Yeah.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
It's just unbelievable.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000
But the funny part is, like, this – it's all about the – like, the main core problem

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
is that all this hatred towards Ubuntu, whether it's – like, whether it's even technically

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.000
justified or not, they just want to jump on as many things as possible.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.000
So, for example, when Snappy was first released in 1604 and it was big, big press, the first

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
thing people said was, well, they just made it for Ubuntu.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.000
They don't care about any other distro.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000
And then when they show that they're working with the community to actually make it for

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
all other distros as much as possible and as soon as possible, well, that doesn't count

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000
anymore.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Like, that – let's completely ignore the fact that the main complaint we had is now

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
completely voided.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Let's make – let's find another reason to hate them.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Yeah.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
I think that's definitely a component.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I think what makes it sort of murky is there is also a technical argument to be made and

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:11.000
there is also legitimate concerns and questions about the CLA and about their closed backend.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000
All questions, I think, could eventually be answered but don't have good answers right

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
now.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.000
And so I wanted to – let's start with – is Ryan and Ike – yeah, good.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000
So let's start with Ike real quick.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Ike, I saw your G Plus post on this and I thought it made it a good opportunity to say,

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.000
you know, we're talking a lot about this in a way that it makes it sound inevitable

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:37.000
but there's probably some pretty common work cases where this type of packaging isn't

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000
really necessary.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:43.000
I think you've been getting a lot of questions about snaps in Solace so I'd be really curious

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
to hear your thoughts about it.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Yeah, I mean, it's been a bit of an outbreak so from my perspective, I've just seen people

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
asking about it because they've heard about this thing called snap.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
It's suddenly a thing now everybody needs to ask about it.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.000
People who hadn't ever heard about it before, this is now the future of everything.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Why aren't you using it, you human scum?

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.000
And this has pretty much been the weight of the tide so far.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Boom.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
From zero to 60.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Yeah, I mean, far be it from me to be outspoken at all.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000
But I mean, people started straight up with Solace.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000
It's like, you really, really, really now need to be using snaps.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:26.000
And it's like, well, I mean, I'm probably going to go into a bit of a rant now myself,

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000
so may I?

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
Yeah, go ahead.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Right, so Solace has been around in one form or another now for the last few years.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
It's got a bit of an old code base and it's got this commotion in the old bugger behind

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
it for the last few years as well.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Now, Solace was designed, as I said earlier, to avoid these design issues, right?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Solace doesn't have 14 different versions of a library.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000
We'll have one.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000
You're only using that.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000
So immediately, we don't have the problem of what if I need this version of a library?

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Well, you're not getting it.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
It's as simple as that.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Well, how are we going to get LibreOffice?

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
We already packaged LibreOffice for you.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Why do you suddenly need LibreOffice packaged?

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:09.000
And then there's the fact that Solace doesn't use a traditional packaging format.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000
So if you look at any traditional format, say a Debian package.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Now, Debian packaging is hard, right?

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:20.000
It's one of the reasons I first went with an independent base because I passionately,

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:23.000
passionately hate Debian packaging.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
That if it was on fire, I wouldn't piss on it, right?

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
I hate it that much.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
So I went as far away in the opposite direction.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Now, when you package something, you have a policy.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
You say, these are development files.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
These are files the user is going to need.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
This thing has relational dependencies between them.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000
So I designed a packaged build system that would tie all those pieces together

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
and put the policy in place.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
So I don't have to do manual file lists.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I don't have to do manual things at all, right?

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.000
So to give an example, Michael Hall posted up an example of how easy it was to package

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
the Genie Editor for Ubuntu and Apple Snaps.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
You saw that post, right?

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I think it was about 32 lines.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Yeah, he said he was editing the YAML file for the GenieSnap from within Genie.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Right.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
The Solus package is smaller.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
The build file is smaller.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:21.000
So from the perspective of Solus, just from a packaging perspective mind,

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000
I'm not talking about confinement or sandboxing.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Snap is technologically inferior to what we already have, okay?

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:36.000
So that's one huge reason for Solus not to need to adopt it.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
We go for integration.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:42.000
So say Solus is using GTK 3.18 now.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
We have the 3.18 theme.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
We want everything to look good, yeah?

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:52.000
So why would it then want to bring in 3.20 packages that then don't quite interact properly

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
or don't look quite well?

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Solus has an optimized runtime.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Would it then want to use a runtime that isn't optimized or is built or maintained by somebody else?

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:08.000
So it sounds like you're worried about it taking away my curation is kind of what you're saying.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I mean, curation is definitely one part of it, but I don't want to water down my system

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:16.000
and trust somebody else to build my operating system because if they were capable of doing that,

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.000
I wouldn't be the person building Solus.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
You are in a unique position there, that's funny.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:27.000
So now I want to ask Ryan, who's sort of on the other end of this, who's got an upstream project

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000
that's moving extremely fast, there's lots of features they want to ship, they want a guarantee.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Clearly he's involved with packaging and the difficulties there.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
And he wants to get out on as many freaking distros as freaking possible.

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:43.000
So Ryan, what are your thoughts about snaps and flat packs and all of that and some of your experience so far?

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Oh boy.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.000
You know that Ike and I used to work on Solus together.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.000
I used to try to help out.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:25:08.000
So the problem is when I'm packaging my crop, I have to pack it for every single thing.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:12.000
It's not enormously – well, no, it is.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
It's kind of an enormous task.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Yeah, that's what I hear a lot.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:22.000
And you've got to do a lot of talking with folks who are involved in the distro.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:28.000
And it's just – it's kind of a mess.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Even Debian packaging is a mess.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Well, I guess Ike kind of said that.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
You're trying to be diplomatic about it.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Just go and say it's awful.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I think everyone knows that.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Yeah, and so the thing is it doesn't have to be snappy.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
It doesn't have to be flat pack.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:50.000
It doesn't have to be AppImage, but whatever – or maybe it's all three of them.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Well, actually, can I make you – I disagree.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:01.000
I think you're being too polite because Mycroft, I mean legitimately, has some server-side components that AppImage simply just doesn't address.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Yeah, and I've thought about that, especially when you're running headless or you're running with the device.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:14.000
But the thing is is all we want to do is be able to give people the newest version of the application.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000
That's it.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
And we just – and we don't want to spend all of our time packaging.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000
I've had a guy who's – Aaron, who's been working two weeks on just packaging.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
And that's kind of ridiculous.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Like we just want to get a version that somebody can pull down and install and not have to worry about it.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:39.000
If that's snappy – I've got SnapD on my Arch machine since we were talking about it. I installed it, but I haven't restarted yet.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000
So the SnapD isn't running.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000
It's not on your path yet.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:54.000
But I was going to – but like the – but the idea is as an application developer, I just want to be able to tell people like here, this is an easy way to install it.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
If you want to pull it from your distro, that's great.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
But like this is a fast way to do it.

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
And we know everything's good in there.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
We know the system libraries.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
You don't have to worry about them.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:15.000
The thing that really actually made me look at Flatpak and look at SnapD is I updated FreeType 2.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I think I talked about this last time I was on here.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:24.000
And FreeType 2 broke all my Electron apps when it went to 2.6.3, I think.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000
And I was like, I can't believe that happened.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:36.000
I can't believe that such a – just this font library broke my Electron apps.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.000
And you can say whatever you want about Electron or about anything along that path.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:51.000
But it would have been great from a user perspective when I'm just trying to use Slack to tell somebody something if it was just all self-contained.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000
And I don't know what the security implications of that are.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:02.000
But it's frustrating, especially when you're trying to get stuff done.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Yeah.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:11.000
So I guess I think, Ryan, the reason why I like your perspective is because I think it represents two valid points of view.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
So I want to toss it back over to Aiki.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:21.000
So Aiki, I think really what I see here is Ryan makes a case for certain specific applications to be distributed this way.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:28.000
And I think you're making the case that the base system and all your daily driver applications should probably be maintained by the distro.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
What do you think?

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Yeah, I mean, you do need a domain separation, right?

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
So I have what I call the operating system.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:47.000
And in the case of Solus, that is basically up to the budget desktop and any – the fat stuff and the stuff that we own, like the web browser, text editor, things like that.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Apps on top of that are then separate.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:56.000
In the case of applications, so from Solus' perspective, we're not owned by a corporation.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000
It's just me, Paddy, here you have to deal with, right?

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
So I can be a bit more flexible than most.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:09.000
If I was a company or something, it'd be harder to deal with Solus, but it's just me because, you know, I'm not here to make a fugue without Solus, so it's simpler for me.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:15.000
So I'm happy to, if you like, bend a few rules to help the application developers get in.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:22.000
But then from the other perspective, I mean, I can make it as easy in the world for any of these guys to package their app up for Solus.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:28.000
I'll even make sure their patch is getting for libraries, or I'll even make sure they have the different versions of the libraries they need.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000
I'm happy to do that.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:34.000
From my perspective, and sorry, Ryan, but you kind of made yourself a target there.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Now, to use MyCraft as an example, now, that's something that I look at as having a system level of components.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Now, as for being up in a flat pack, well, I've already gone and looked at the code.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Now, Ryan himself will tell you, I've already requested an architectural analysis of that.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000
I've gone and looked through Mimic because I'm not happy with the code, right?

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000
And I've worked with them.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000
They've had a few issues there and I've spoken with them, and they are responsive.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
I'm good in that.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:07.000
But things like that, I wouldn't want to go in first because I don't want Solus users in the dark, right?

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Because then you're getting into an area, now, not to use, specifically not to use Mimic or MyCraft in this example,

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:22.000
but what you then get is a downward spiral that contributes to incompetency of software engineering practices.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:30.000
So, by allowing everybody to run in a container, by allowing everyone to be isolated, they can get away with having shite code.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
But don't they already?

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
Yeah, but I'm not one of those people.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:40.000
I'm the sort of person who runs their code through Valgrind and static analysis and makes sure it doesn't leak.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:46.000
So, by allowing these things to just break, like, do whatever they want because they're in a sandbox,

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.000
we're just going to have this downward spiral of incompetency.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:55.000
It would be like saying if you put your car and limited it to 10 miles an hour and put cushions all around the side of it.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:03.000
I think you're caught in a logic loop here because I think we are already in that paradigm of software quality

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:10.000
and that's why projects like yours exist in the first place because we're sick and tired of it

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:13.000
and we need people who care about some of those small things.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Sure, but I mean, there does need to be, it's a case of owners, isn't it?

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:24.000
We all need to agree, first of all, we do need the OS app separation, right?

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:29.000
So, the OS, everything up to and including the desktop that you ship, that belongs to you.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:34.000
If your version of a library breaks the applications, you're a bad vendor, right?

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:39.000
If the applications break the operating system, that's a bad application.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
So, I can see why you need the separation.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.000
What about the use case that some of these things solve?

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Not necessarily a flat pack, but definitely app image and snaps.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000
What about this really important use case where you just have no control over this?

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Somebody discovers Solace, they download it, they've just recently switched over from a Mac or Windows

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:03.000
and the way they install software is they go to the vendor's website and they download it from their website.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.000
They're dumb, they don't know any better, curse them, but that's how they want to do it.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:14.000
That is a one example, but legitimately, let's be honest, it really is solving a problem.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Did you be able to say, there are better ways to get software on Linux, but if you want to download this snap,

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:24.000
just go here, download these snaps or that use case, here's a thumb drive full of snaps, install these.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:30.000
There are scenarios where it is beneficial to the entire platform as a whole to be able to say,

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000
this could be installed on Linux.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
End of sentence.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I mean, it can be beneficial, but I mean, there's so many problems with this as well.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:48.000
So, when I install a.exe, I mean, I'm sorry, when I install a snap from the internet,

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
because this is exactly what we're emulating.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Between Flatpak and Snap, we're just trying to emulate Android, right?

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Yeah, I guess so.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
This is exactly what we're trying to do here.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.000
We're downloading arbitrary files from the internet and install it, but this time,

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000
we're going to do it without the store itself, which is what snaps are trying to do.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Except there's a store and there's a repo with snaps, so no.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:13.000
Yeah, except for the store, none of our distributions can actually contribute code to this unless we,

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
the store itself, we can't see, right?

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
That's completely proprietary.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:22.000
We're not allowed to see it, but we're going to trust code going through though, yeah?

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:28.000
There's a difference between saying you don't trust it and saying it doesn't exist.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Along with that, if I want to contribute code to get any of Snap fixed or better integrated,

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I then have to sign a contributor license agreement.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000
I agree.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000
So, how open is it really?

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000
It's open in terms of code.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000
The code is open, but if I want to contribute it and I want to integrate into Solus, then I can't.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000
I think you could throw snaps out there and the entire conversation is still valid

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:52.000
if you're just talking flat pack and app image.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:56.000
I agree that I think none of them are technically close yet.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
I mean, close might not be the thing, but...

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
I mean, they have kind of definitely a while to go.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000
And this is the thing.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000
We're getting into heated arguments nowadays like, well, everybody is,

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000
but neither of them have had a chance to prove themselves yet.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.000
It's early days.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:14.000
I think it is early, and I think what I think I really appreciate about your viewpoint is

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:20.000
it represents sort of the person who's willing to go that extra step,

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.000
to think a little bit harder about the way these things are built,

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000
to present the user with better options, to make sure that things are built and designed properly

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:33.000
and things are running current, and those are going to be the people that are the most disserviced,

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
I think, by the more generic software installation gets on Linux.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:42.000
And so I think the point that you're representing here in this conversation is a huge point of input

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
that we're getting, it's not exactly refined like that yet,

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.000
but we're getting a lot of that feedback into the show, is there is a point for the package maintainer.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:54.000
There is a point for the builder, for the assembler, and we have come to these positions

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
and had people do these jobs for very specific reasons.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.000
It wasn't just arbitrary that we just one day all decided we're going to have package maintainers

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000
and we're going to have repos and we're going to do software this way,

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000
and we're going to share libraries.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000
That wasn't just an accident.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.000
There was good reason for it, and when you implement it properly,

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:14.000
it is a very good system, and it's not going away necessarily.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:18.000
And then I think Ryan does a great job of representing the upstream project

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:22.000
that's got something really neat on their hands that they want to get out to as many people possible

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:28.000
in the most predictable manner possible, in the most user-acceptable manner possible.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.000
And that's also a completely legitimate point of view.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
I have a question for Ryan.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000
Go ahead, Ryan.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Ryan, if you have a situation where the packaging, the current structure of packaging,

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:47.000
let's say the application level and not the core base was just those three competing.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.000
All of the three, the Flatpak, the SNAPS, and the AppImage,

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
are all equally dominant at some point in time.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:59.000
Would that be an improvement to the current state?

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000
If they were all competing but all still...

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000
Say that one more time, I'm sorry.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.000
If you had to make three packages, and depending on the distro,

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:12.000
let's say some distros use SNAPS, some use Flatpak,

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.000
but they don't all have a universal, they don't all agree to that.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:18.000
But instead of having to deal with the maintainers,

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000
instead of having to deal with different formats based on the different distros

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
and the different distro versions, you only had to make three,

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.000
one for each structure for Flatpak, SNAPS, etc.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:35.000
Would that be an improvement to the current state for Mycroft?

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Sure. I mean, what we're talking about is kind of totally different, I think.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Ike is talking about some of these lower-level system libraries

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
that, frankly, Mycroft does use.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
We walk kind of a line.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:53.000
We've had issues packaging with SNAPI in the past

01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:01.000
because we touch some things that are not as simple as your normal desktop application.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000
But the thing that we're trying to do,

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
and I think what a lot of application vendors are trying to do,

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:15.000
is put something out there where they're not so worried about

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:20.000
system library changing like free type 2 when they haven't written support for that yet.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:26.000
There are a lot of things like that where you're trying to do your best

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:33.000
as an application developer, but you got so many competing desires from your users

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000
that sometimes you need to have that direct relationship with them

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.000
in order to provide a good, consistent, stable experience.

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:50.000
And I think that if we demonize these projects,

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
and I know that's not what a lot of people are doing,

01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:00.000
but there's obviously a reason that they're gaining traction,

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.000
and that's because application developers are having a hard time targeting Linux

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
and getting a consistent experience to their users.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
And to talk about the trust issue,

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:20.000
if somebody is willing to go and grab a PPA for a piece of software,

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.000
they already trust who's providing that PPA.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Should they trust them? I don't know.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.000
But they already do, and there's a lot of trust that's thrown around anyway.

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.000
You know, you're trusting the maintainers.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Sorry, there's people confusing PPAs with being canonically maintained.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Yeah, I think you make a good point, Ryan.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.000
And I want to give you sort of the final input here.

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:45.000
You said you have a proposition.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.000
I'll start off with one bit of confusion I actually had with Ryan there,

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
which I didn't understand.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Ryan, you just asked if they were all competing standards,

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.000
would you then accept them all and it would all be a good thing.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.000
That doesn't seem like it makes sense to me.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.000
You would adopt one of these standards because of the universal standard

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
to solve the problem of not doing the other packaging formats.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:11.000
Otherwise, you'd essentially just took on three more packaging formats.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.000
No, I didn't. No.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.000
I never said we would just package one.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.000
I never said we would just package one of those.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000
That's not what I just said either.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Hold on, stop, stop.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
This is not really worth talking about.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
It's just simple.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:34.000
The question was if you could basically get away with using just AppImage,

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
Flatpak, and Snaps.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
You've essentially covered the entire ecosystem.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Isn't that better than creating four different versions of the RPM,

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
two devs, one for Debian, one for Ubuntu,

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
and submitting it to the openSUSE build service

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
and trying to get it in copper.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000
That's what I was saying.

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Yeah, that's all you're saying.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000
It's not better.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
I think seriously that the problem is elsewhere.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Seriously, the problem is that developers have been doing development

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.000
relying on system-wide things like package names.

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Developers used version control systems appropriately.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.000
By appropriately, I mean include your dependencies in your project tree

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000
as a submodule of GitHub or SVN or whatever.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:18.000
This would allow any maintainer to go and compile the project.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Now, how they distribute those files in their distribution is their problem.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:26.000
But everyone, there is a maintainer, will be able to just get your source

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
and build it.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000
That would actually fix things.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.000
We wouldn't care if we're deploying 30 different packages

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
because at the end of the day, anyone really wanting,

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.000
they could download the source and build.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.000
I don't want to wait for a maintainer to do that.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.000
I think just the complication of that landscape.

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Here's what I get on the Coda Radio show.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.000
A lot of people who want to start distributing Linux server-side apps

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.000
and they want to ask Mike and I the best way to go about it.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000
The number one thing they have a problem with is,

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:59.000
I can't effing figure out how to even get my app out there.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
How do I package it?

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Which one should I be packaging it for?

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
Which version of those districts should I package it for?

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Then once I've packaged it, how the hell do I let anybody know about it?

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000
There's no app store.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
There's no central news place that people check.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.000
How the hell do I let anybody know I've created this thing?

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.000
The entire process is so opaque to them.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000
It's so nebulous to them that they honestly say,

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000
you know what, I got better things to do.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000
I'll just go make a Docker container and call it good.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.000
I'm out.

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Okay, so we should probably wrap it up.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
But I guess the point is,

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
is what I think people are fundamentally missing

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
when they're not getting the entire argument is,

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.000
and maybe I'll send it back to Ikey so we can finish this thought here,

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.000
but the point is, there's a problem out there,

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.000
a meta-problem that goes beyond the technology,

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:50.000
that goes beyond the sandboxing, that goes beyond who created it.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.000
The meta-problem is, is there is a wave of talent

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
that wants to create software for a platform,

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.000
and they simply can't even figure out how to get the applications here.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
And if you don't think it's true,

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
you haven't been talking to a lot of developers,

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.000
because it is fundamentally just that stupid basic problem

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
is what's holding up a ton of them.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
As I looked at it, it looked super complicated.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
I ain't got time for that.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
And when you have so many choices, how do you know which one?

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
And they're not familiar with it.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:21.000
Or a really fancy app for the Mac OS X,

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
because they're defined.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Or you end up with your own cloud on Debian.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
But okay, I know that wasn't your main point

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
about the semantics of the packages.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
You had another point you wanted to make in there, right?

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Yeah, no, I mean, that one I was just literally confused about.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Yeah, so finish it up there.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Didn't know that was going to happen.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
So my proposal is basically this.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
I know it probably is not actually on here at the moment,

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
so I'll let him reply on IRC.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
So this one's a bit of a freeway.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000
But, well, moving on.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.000
So my proposal is basically this.

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:59.000
I know I've raised concerns over parts of the code base in Mimic.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Now, to be clear, this is not me trying to crap on Mimic, right?

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.000
This is because of the forked code base that it started from.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.000
Now that stuff is already a nightmare to work with.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
I can see that.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
So I'm not crapping on those guys' stuff.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
So my proposal goes freeway.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:21.000
Ryan, it feels like this is your life.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:26.000
I will package all of my craft for Solus, right?

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:30.000
And I will demonstrate how easy this is going to be.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
That's a great title.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
I will demonstrate how easy this is going to be.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Now, it's something I'm going to be maintaining, right?

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.000
And just as long, I want you to take the patches coming back.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.000
So this is, you know, to get everyone back in the mood

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
and open source and contribute, right?

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
I will give you the patches back from Solus

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
for the things that I have concerns about,

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
as opposed to just sitting there bitching about them.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Now, because there's a lot of that that goes on these days.

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000
And for Popey, there are some things I think

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:03.000
that Y package in Solus has already done, right?

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Now, as much as I picked on it before for having some technical limitations

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
in comparison to Solus' Y package,

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.000
that doesn't mean that Snappy isn't good for Ubuntu.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000
What doesn't work for us will actually work for Ubuntu, right?

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
This is their solution. That's great.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:23.000
There are some things we have already done in Y package in Solus

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:29.000
that I keep going to say, flat back, I'm sorry, but it's not.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
There are some things that it could really, really benefit from.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
So some of the things that we took from Clear Linux,

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.000
it could also benefit from them, like the optimizations,

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
the advanced pattern and logic.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000
So some of those concepts, some of the constructs that we use

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000
in our YAML files, I think they could really do those.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Now, personally, I'm not going to be able to sign the CLA.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.000
So what I'll do, I will put those contributions out as public domain,

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:55.000
and I will leave those for anyone in the canonical to take them up

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
and merge them if they wish.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.000
Nice. And you know what? If Mycroft in some way,

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
like a Venom extension or some capacity,

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000
ended up integrated into the desktop on Solus...

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
Oh, boy, that wouldn't be a bad thing.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Well, we have Raven, don't we?

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
I would have to run that on my laptop.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
I would think I'd get that on my laptop.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
We have the Raven sidebar. How sexy would that be?

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Yeah. That's my promise.

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:22.000
I would like to point out, too, that I love Solus.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000
I used to be a part of that community, and I've used Y package,

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.000
and it's a good solution.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:36.000
So Ike and I, we get along in other settings.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
It's Wes. He brings out the worst in people.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
I sure do.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Yeah. But what we're just trying to do is find easy ways

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.000
to get our software to users.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.000
I mean, this has got to be, wherever we end up,

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.000
this is going to be kind of a good thing for projects like yours, Ryan.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:59.000
So I'm excited for it, and I can't imagine you aren't.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
Can you share it all?

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.000
Have people from Canonical contacted the project and said,

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
can we get you started? Can we help?

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:07.000
What's that process been like?

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Because that seems to be sort of a key piece that they've done

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
that's helped them get an early start on a lot of snaps,

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.000
is Canonical is working directly with different projects

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
to help them say, hey, do you have any questions?

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
Are you interested? Can we help you?

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Have you had any discussions like that?

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.000
So first I'd like to real quick thank Ike,

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:28.000
and I can't think of who else popped in,

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:35.000
but some early folks popped in from Solace and from Ubuntu

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:42.000
and a guy from Fedora to provide some kind of day one and day two feedback

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.000
on the repo when it first went open source, the MyCraftCore repo.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.000
So first I want to thank those guys.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.000
But yeah, we have had the Ubuntu guys reach out to us

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.000
and walk us through packaging.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:01.000
We have some requirements as far as access to the sound devices

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:06.000
that we still do a back and forth with them on.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.000
I'm making sure that it picks the right sound device.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Yeah, it needs to pick the right sound device.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.000
It needs to pick the sound device that's in use by the user.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
It needs to have a good default.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:24.000
There's a lot of nuance in picking and managing sound devices.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:29.000
But all around they've been really good providing feedback.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:35.000
I talked to Adam Miller on the Fedora project

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000
who also provided some feedback around Flatpak.

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:46.000
But yes, so far everybody who I've spoken to on the Snappy team

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
has been really great about answering questions,

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
so same with the Flatpak guys.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:54.000
And then of course there have been Wimpy

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:00.000
who helped us out with packaging for Debian for Ubuntu.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:06.000
So I don't want to poop on any of the packaging things.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.000
And I want to say that the Snappy guys and the Flatpak guys

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:13.000
have been great providing feedback.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:22.000
My two cents is that I'd really like to start discussing

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000
the technical merits of these projects,

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000
like you've been advocating for, Chris.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:34.000
I'd love to see more write-ups on what the actual difference is

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:38.000
and not about canonical quote-unquote propaganda.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Boy, that is so great.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
I think that's probably our ending note right there

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:44.000
is I think just maybe future episodes,

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
maybe we'll just start the conversation,

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
future episodes I'd like to talk about.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.000
First of all, Flatpaks are very much a repo-based technology

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.000
which is a totally different approach than say AppImage

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000
or Snap necessarily can be a totally different approach

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.000
and is in some ways reminiscent of PPAs, good and bad,

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:05.000
and means software updates will be easier.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
There's a lot of technology there, right?

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Their sandboxing is further along for different distributions.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Snaps, I think it's only on Ubuntu and Arch right now,

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.000
but how are they doing that?

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
What is AppArmor the right choice?

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
All these questions that we have,

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.000
questions about re-implementing the Snap store backend

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
or creating your own Snap store.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:28.000
Do you have to rebuild the Snap D program?

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000
And where will the real community actually flourish?

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Yeah, is uApp browser, whatever it is, uBrowser, whatever it is,

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.000
is that going to be the place?

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
All these little questions that we have I think now

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
are what we should start talking about

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
and the technical aspects of them.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.000
I think this part of it, it really has moved

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000
to a very partisan discussion very quickly,

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:53.000
but I don't know if there's much more productive conversation

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
to be had there.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000
I will say I think we may end up with two regardless.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
I think that something you said caught my attention,

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000
just that really Snaps are the only one

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
with any server focus at all.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000
Like Flatpak explicitly says that it doesn't really fit with the server

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
and AppImage has that great desktop in there.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:12.000
So I think really Docker or something like that

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
is here to stay on the server side too.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
So there's probably at least going to be two.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000
The momentum and demand around delivering reliable,

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.000
consistent, predictable software on the server

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:26.000
is going to make Snaps at least successful

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:27.000
on the Ubuntu platform.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
I think probably that alone.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.000
But all of that is a conversation for another day.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
Join us on Sunday on the Linux Action Show.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
We'll be reviewing the new Fedora release.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
I'm really looking forward to it.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
This is the release I have been hoping for.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
Gnome 320 is looking nice.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000
It's got Flatpak support.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:46.000
I've had a Fedora installation on the server running for a while now

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
that I'm going to be upgrading to Fedora 24

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.000
and reporting on that.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Really have been looking forward to it.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:52.000
Join us live Tuesday.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.000
That's my next Tuesday, my last episode before I go on vacay.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Wes, you may not be here too.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.000
I may not be here.

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
So we may have a special guest sitting in Wes's chair.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Find out the time in your local time

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
by going to jupyterbroadcasting.com.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Then join us at jblive.tv, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:34.000
I've never installed Gnome slash Linux.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
Zombies don't run Linux.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:47.000
I've never installed Gnome slash Linux.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
I got the sense right as we were leaving there,

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
the rotten, you had something you wanted to add,

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000
but we were wrapping up.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Did you have, did you want to complete a thought?

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:58.000
I was just going to answer your question about the UAP Explorer.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.000
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
That's the unofficial, non-canonical thing.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Right, yeah.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Remember how the Ubuntu forms were unofficial at one time?

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Remember that?

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
And they became, that's a long time ago.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.000
That's a while ago.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.000
jbtitles.com.

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Well, the UAP Explorer is not just snappy.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:15.000
It also has click packages, so it's kind of like a mess right now.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Yeah, for now.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:19.000
Hey, both, a big thank you to both Ryan and Ike,

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
who had stepped in the ring.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Thank you also, of course, to everybody who contributed.

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000
But it was, there was a lot of heavy lifting there by you guys.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Really appreciate it.

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Yeah, I don't think I needed to mention it,

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
but it was very nice having different perspectives

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.000
from the different audiences.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.000
Absolutely.

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Yeah.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Maintainers, packagers, all that.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:42.000
I wanted to add that Mycroft is already dockerized.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Right, so there you go.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.000
There you go.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Of course it is.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Right?

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000
Everything's dockerized.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.000
All right.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
drivertitles.com, you guys.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Got to go to drivertitles.com.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
My little poppy.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Oh boy.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
That poppy sounded like a robot, huh?

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000
I got to get...

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Sorry about the My Little Poppy one.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:03.000
I got to get Mycroft installed on this machine

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
just so I can make poppy say stuff during the show

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000
when he's not here.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Right?

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000
You have to.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.000
That's obvious.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Poppies are going to end up showing up on a lot of podcasts.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
I want...

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:20.000
So I want the functionality to say Mycroft define coconut.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Like I want to be able to just...

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Can I do that, Ryan?

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000
Will I be able to get like a word definition?

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Because that's what I would like to have right here

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
in the studio with a mic on it.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.000
And that way when I want to define something,

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:37.000
I can just ask Mycroft and then poppy reads the answer.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Let me check.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Let me pop them up right now.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:44.000
I love it.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.000
So Eki, you spent a lot of effort trying to make sure

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
that games work on it, especially Steam games,

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:54.000
but are you getting any support from Valve

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.000
and doesn't it kind of suck if you're not?

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Well, I mean, you must have realized by now,

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000
I'm, you know, I'm half wired wrong.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.000
So in terms of support from Valve,

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
the way I kind of look at it defined is like,

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:14.000
well, I'm doing it because they're not.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000
You know, I mean, eventually they're going to pick up

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000
on what I'm doing and eventually all this stuff

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000
will become the norm and everything will be fixed.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
But it doesn't really bug me, to be honest with you.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
Do I think they should have been doing it properly first?

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Yes.

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Do I think they should have used Ubuntu 12.04

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
and use a runtime library like that? No.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:35.000
But it's the same reason why I think Flatpak is doomed as well

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
because of the whole thing.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000
We're going to provide your API, um, ABI,

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
but we're not going to define it.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000
So what it should have been is like, this is the ABI we need,

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000
not this is the ABI you're going to use in this exact form.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000
And that's exactly the same problem Flatpak has.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.000
And it's the reason why Flatpak would never go into Solus,

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:58.000
why Snap would never be a primary form.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.000
It could be something we could accept as a secondary form in Solus, you know?

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Because it doesn't push that, um,

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:06.000
it doesn't force that distribution method on you.

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:09.000
That's perfect because Snap is not, it's intended to be a supplement.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
It's not intended to replace the core at all.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Like, Far Shutterworth was asked about whether Snap would make it

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
where that Debian was not necessary.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
And he said that was never going to happen,

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:23.000
that Debian is a fundamental importance to Ubuntu.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Yeah, there's no reason for them to pursue that.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.000
Hold on, hold on, guys.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.000
This is CNN Breaking News.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
We have an update from Robot Popey.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Greetings, Professor Falken.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:39.000
Would you like to see some projected kill ratios?

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Oh, God.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
That's awesome.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:47.000
And that is our, oh, God, that is our Popey robot update.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.000
Where did that come from?

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Popey.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000
The Whopper, I believe.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Popey's inside the Whopper now.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:55.000
That's amazing.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.000
So, yeah, I got to get hooked up to the stream.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000
Yep.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Oh, Popey.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:01.000
That is maybe the next most important JB project.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Oh, Popey.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
You know, JBot needs a voice.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000
Yes, it does.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.000
JBot needs a voice.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.000
It needs to come alive.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Wouldn't it be great if at the end of the show we could turn on JBot?

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:15.000
And, like, wouldn't it be, I wonder if there's a way we could,

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000
you wouldn't want people to, like, jam it up.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000
No.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
But you'd want to have certain people, I don't know,

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.000
because you wouldn't want to limit it either,

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.000
but it would be great if we could give JBot a voice

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000
at this point in time during the show.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Can we ask Ryan right now that if you asked Mycroft,

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.000
would you like to play a game?

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:33.000
That's the answer.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000
How about a game of chess?

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.000
That was pretty good.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.000
That was good.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Greetings, Professor Falcon.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Would you like to see some projected kill ratios?

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
You know what I got to do is I got to put that on the soundboard

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.000
is what I got to do, because that's going to be handy.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.000
I secretly use Arch Linux.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
All right, so we got to go pick our title

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:55.000
and then we got to get out of here.

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Yep.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:57.000
It's getting ridiculous.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Oh, yeah, sure.
