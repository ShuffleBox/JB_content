1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
So, you know, as part of my job for these shows is I stay on top of the news.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,560
And one of the things I found really handy about Google Now is it's getting a pretty

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,000
good sense of the news I like to read.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,760
And this article showed up in my Google Now feed with wireless conversions on the Pro

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,760
5.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,280
Ubuntu phone levels up.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,280
And I thought to myself, oh, interesting.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,400
I hope they have a video of it because I really want to see that.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,960
I hope that there's something to watch so I can see an action.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,800
So I come down here and I hit play and I think, that sounds familiar.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,800
Sounds like a robot.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,600
Try and connect it to my TV.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,320
Sounds like some sort of AI.

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,800
If I knew more people were going to watch this video, I would have tidied my lounge.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,240
Yeah, and maybe add a better mic, I mean, for goodness sake.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,960
So really you're just in your room there, you hit a button on your Ubuntu phone and

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,000
this giant Microsoft display lights up.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,360
Now what's with the Microsoft display?

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,640
Tell us the story about that.

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,480
That's a Miracast dongle.

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,360
There's like numerous companies that make Miracast dongles.

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,760
And it just happens to be that the first one that we got working was a Microsoft one because

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,040
I think that's the first one a developer happened to have nearby and it was cheap.

24
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,480
I think some LG TVs work as well.

25
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,240
So I bought one because he said that one works, so I bought one, plugged it into the TV, went

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,920
and got my phone and when I came back there was a Windows logo on my TV.

27
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,820
It's like, you know, we swallowed that pill too when we decided, well, I want a really

28
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,320
good game controller under Linux, so I'll get the Xboxes and even us, the most hardcore

29
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,960
Linux users, eventually buckled down and did it for the most part.

30
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,080
So yeah, it looks pretty good, how's the performance?

31
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:50,520
So there's a little bit of lag and it's noticeable if you, like on that video it's not very good

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,560
because my thumb is jittering across the display, but I did another video where it's a lot smoother

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,440
and I pick up a window with a mouse and drag it around and it's a lot easier.

34
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
Is that on your channel too?

35
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,880
Yes, the next video, I think.

36
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,860
But does that one have nearly 10,000 views?

37
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,860
That's the big question.

38
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,860
No.

39
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,860
That's all Chris is interested in.

40
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,240
Because it's not got some fat guy standing in front of a TV, that's why.

41
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,720
Okay, it's only got 2,700 views, yeah, okay.

42
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,440
Also the OMG Ubuntu effect helps.

43
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,120
So yeah, you just press a button and it scans your local network for Miracast devices and

44
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
it shows them all.

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,400
So it'll show your Sony TV or your Sanyo or Samsung or whatever TV, but it might not necessarily

46
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
connect to them.

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:38,280
But the cool thing is the log files are captured in Varlog like any standard Linux device and

48
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:44,120
you can grab those, the software is called Aethercast and you just grab the log from

49
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,560
there and file a bug on Launchpad and they'll work through all the devices to get others

50
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
working.

51
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,280
So you asked about performance.

52
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,100
It's a bit laggy, there's a bit of a delay and they're working on improving the encoding

53
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,360
and the performance and there's also some funky stuff that I don't fully understand

54
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,640
about how there's multiple channels that you can send data to the device.

55
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,440
There's like the video stream which shows the display and there's a separate channel

56
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,840
where you can tell it where the cursor is.

57
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,300
So rather than you sending an image of the desktop and an image of the cursor, you can

58
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:23,400
tell it the X, Y coordinates of the cursor and the dongle paints the cursor faster.

59
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,620
You don't get that perception of lag.

60
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,440
And this is, now do these two devices set up a Wi-Fi network between each other directly

61
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,280
or do they just have to be on the same LAN?

62
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
How does that work?

63
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,200
Dude, it's magic.

64
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,720
I have no idea how the hell this works.

65
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,800
I just press a button and this stuff appears.

66
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,600
You can tell the surprise in my voice when it works.

67
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,080
It was the first time I tested it.

68
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Really?

69
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,760
Yeah, I watched the video like halfway through when I look up, I pan the phone up and look

70
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,520
at the screen, I'm like, oh, that worked then, okay then.

71
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,320
I love it when that kind of stuff happens.

72
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:03,920
And the nice thing is that unlike Chromecast, which is in a lot of things, or Apple's Airplay,

73
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,040
this Miracast, I mean there's a lot of devices out there that have it built in as just sort

74
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,520
of an industry standard, right?

75
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,280
My Sony TV, that TV actually has it built in, but it doesn't work yet.

76
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,160
There's some protocol thing.

77
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,520
Apparently it turns out that Miracast is a standard, but they all implement it differently.

78
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,280
Every single dongle is broken.

79
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
Surprise.

80
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,280
Yeah.

81
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,040
That's always how it goes.

82
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
You know what?

83
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,680
The Linux community has seen that before.

84
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,840
That is not, we're used to that.

85
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Well, cool.

86
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,840
The good part is our part, the Ethercast part is free software.

87
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
It's on Launchpad.

88
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
That's awesome.

89
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,760
It's Miracast, so I think it's using some components from some other Miracast tools

90
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,560
that are around, so if people want to get it working on their TV, then that's the code

91
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
you need to hack on.

92
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,400
You know, it's funny because a lot of times in discussions with people, when we talked

93
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,300
about convergence, a lot of people, I think Matt was one of them, who was like, call me

94
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,360
when it's wireless.

95
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,960
If I have to sit down and put my phone into a dock, I'm done, and I always thought, whatever.

96
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
I want a dock.

97
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
I want a hardwired connection.

98
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
Sounds so great.

99
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,040
But there is something to the being able to just project your screen up onto a larger

100
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,360
screen on almost anywhere you go.

101
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,760
If this took off, you could just see an organization equipping their conference rooms with those

102
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,240
TVs that they know, or those dongles that they know are going to work with something

103
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
like this.

104
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,200
And now you have the ability to present in front of everybody immediately by sending

105
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
your screen up there.

106
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Oh, that sounds great.

107
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Yeah.

108
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,000
In fact, the first time I saw this, the first time I was at a sprint in Prague a few weeks

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,880
ago, and the first time I saw it was one of the Unity 8 developers did a demo.

110
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,360
We do like demos at our internal sprint, so we get everyone up to speed with what's going

111
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,320
on elsewhere in the company.

112
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,920
And he stood up and connected his phone, I say connected, you know, in the wireless way,

113
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,700
connected it to this dongle, which was connected to a projector.

114
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,640
So we're all watching this on a projector.

115
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,980
And we're thinking, wow, you could actually give a presentation directly from your device

116
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,480
because the phone becomes your mouse and keyboard.

117
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:05,360
If you click on a field, which is a an input field, the onscreen keyboard pops up on the

118
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
phone.

119
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,120
So you can just use the phone as a mouse and a keyboard.

120
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,840
It's not the easiest thing to do.

121
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,760
But if you wanted to give a presentation, you totally could do that.

122
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,760
Oh, yeah.

123
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
Oh, sure.

124
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
I've done that with some apps.

125
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
And you know, I know they think about it.

126
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:23,600
I have seen offices that have Apple TVs and have a Chromecast on hooked up to their devices.

127
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,780
But in the case of the Apple TV, that's a huge expense because the devices that are

128
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,000
capable of communicating with that have a massive premium, which is not always optimal

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,440
in the business place, or especially in the education market, which is a massive field

130
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,000
for this, a massive field for this.

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,640
And the Chromecast, the downside to that, the price is right.

132
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,280
And the availability is high.

133
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,280
But the dependency on a third-party service makes it unreliable and makes it problematic

134
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,160
for large institutions behind multi-level firewalls and things like that.

135
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,760
So something that is over your local Wi-Fi network, a industry standard to some degree,

136
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,920
and built into potential mobile devices, there is a lot of room for that still.

137
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
That's really cool.

138
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
I'm excited.

139
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
Check.

140
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:25,400
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 149 for June 14, 2016.

141
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,840
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that is reporting on the front lines

142
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,700
of the Linux packaging cold war.

143
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,700
My name is Chris.

144
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,700
My name is Wes.

145
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,700
Do you like that?

146
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,700
Oh, I like it a lot.

147
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
You know what I'm referring to.

148
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,700
I certainly do.

149
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,700
We're going to get into it.

150
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,700
I mean, it's unbelievable.

151
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,700
As if we had planned it.

152
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:49,760
Almost every week there is some big development in universal Linux packaging.

153
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,200
You know, that one installer for all distros.

154
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,400
Maybe someday we'll even be able to use them.

155
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,800
So Canonical is here this week with a huge bombshell announcement in this category.

156
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,920
So we're going to talk about that.

157
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,400
We're going to even try it right here on the show.

158
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,120
We've been trying it and give you our early hands-on.

159
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,480
Speaking of early hands-on, elementary OS has their new Loki beta out based on Ubuntu

160
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,840
16.04 and full of all of their new shiny.

161
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,280
There's also a few hints of things they may have coming.

162
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
We'll tell you all about that.

163
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,280
Our early impressions, because it is just a beta, so bear that in mind.

164
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,080
And then we have a bunch of epic open source project updates.

165
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,920
Stories that broke just in the last couple of days.

166
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,520
Extremely relevant to our interest.

167
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
So guess what?

168
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,360
We're going to cover them right here on the show.

169
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,680
We're going to do that right here.

170
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,240
The rumors of my vacation were false.

171
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,240
That's coming later.

172
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,960
I'm hanging in there for a few more weeks.

173
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Are you strong?

174
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,560
Thinking back, thinking back, if I could have planned it, I would have left town like a

175
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,760
honeymoon after a wedding.

176
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,880
As soon as I wrapped up Lass's 10th anniversary, I would have left town, because boy could

177
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
I use it.

178
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
But I'll tell you what.

179
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,960
The fight goes on.

180
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,200
We continue to be on the front lines, just like our virtual lug.

181
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Let's bring them in now.

182
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,760
Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

183
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
Hey guys.

184
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Hello.

185
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Hello.

186
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,760
Hello.

187
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Hello.

188
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,120
So I guess I made a comment last week, because Wimpy messaged me and was like, so are you

189
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
on vacation?

190
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
I'm like, no.

191
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
I need a vacation.

192
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,520
But no, I am not on vacation.

193
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,040
So if you were surprised that I'm here this week, I apologize for misstating.

194
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,160
Well, that's always a good surprise.

195
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Yeah.

196
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Thanks, Wes.

197
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,160
Thanks.

198
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,200
But I will be going on vacation the first week of July.

199
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,520
So Mr. Colonel will probably be sitting down with you on the show.

200
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,520
Oh.

201
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,520
Yeah.

202
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,920
And of course, it means I'll probably miss two weeks of Lass, too.

203
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,840
So we'll probably have a guest hosting there.

204
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
Hint, hint.

205
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
You may already know him.

206
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
Hmm.

207
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Hmm.

208
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
Hmm.

209
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,600
So before we're here to talk about today, though, today we have some really big news.

210
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,640
We have what you might even say is breaking news.

211
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,760
I should break it out just for the special event, some CNN breaking news.

212
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,760
This is CNN breaking news.

213
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Big stories.

214
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,160
Two big stories, really, to start the show off with.

215
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,880
Number one is that Nextcloud actually has some code shipping.

216
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,360
Nextcloud 9 is available, and enterprise functionality is going open source, well ahead of the July

217
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,600
promise, I guess, of the early July promise, I guess.

218
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,000
Nextcloud makes available Nextcloud version 9.

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,600
They're also releasing all enterprise functionality as open source, building on top of the open

220
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,420
source own cloud core and adding functionality and fixes.

221
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,400
This release provides a solid base for users to migrate to.

222
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Hmm.

223
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
What do you think, Wes?

224
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,880
Yeah, they've got an Android app here they can get for free, too.

225
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,720
Are you surprised at how fast this came?

226
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
That is kind of fast.

227
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,760
I mean, just from what they were saying before, they didn't really hint at... I expected

228
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,600
it in a month or two, maybe, but hey, maybe I'm going to have to spin this up and just

229
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
play with it.

230
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,200
I'm sure there's not that much that's different, right, than the own cloud on YouTube, but

231
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,800
I'd be curious to see how it feels.

232
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:58,280
This release really has got to be about this new enterprise functionality, the new branding,

233
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,680
and I think it's got to be about momentum, too.

234
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
Right.

235
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,520
They need to start off their new project and really have a good, solid release and have

236
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,680
a platform they're built on.

237
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
What's your read on it, Daredevil?

238
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,760
Basically, I think it's a publicity stunt and smart because you just had a bad impact

239
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
new.

240
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,280
You have to bring new, fast impact news while still people are paying attention to what's

241
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,080
going on with you.

242
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,080
So it is sort of a building on the momentum thing and a smart one.

243
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,440
It shows a good instinct.

244
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,600
It shows that they got some savvy behind them.

245
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
We want that.

246
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,920
This next cloud thing's going to work out.

247
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
That's what I think.

248
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
I mean, look at them.

249
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,920
I'm tempted to go try it.

250
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,920
Is that a prediction?

251
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
I'm tempted.

252
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
I mean …

253
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,920
Oh, yeah.

254
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,920
Maybe we should get one up and running.

255
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,240
I just sort of got my head wrapped around the last release of OnCloud, so it seems almost

256
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,880
too soon to go to something else, but probably the sooner you switch, the better.

257
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,200
Traditionally though, the sooner you upgrade, probably the better.

258
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,920
I guess you don't want to go too many releases, I mean.

259
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,920
Right.

260
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Probably true.

261
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
Get it over with.

262
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,920
Exactly.

263
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
All right.

264
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Anybody else have thoughts on the new next cloud release before we move right along?

265
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,720
Got a couple other big stories.

266
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,920
I thought this one was interesting, just a sort of rebuttal to some discussion that was

267
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,760
out there regarding the slowdown of Steam machines.

268
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
Wait.

269
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,760
There's still Steam machines?

270
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,760
Slowdown.

271
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
I thought those were dead, Chris.

272
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
No.

273
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
No.

274
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,360
They're still around, and in fact, that company, Valve, has got a good announcement, along

275
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
with Dell.

276
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,640
They've just pumped out a couple of more of these suckers, a couple of more of these.

277
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,040
They've upgraded them to Skylake.

278
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,760
These SOBs now got Skylake in them with DDR4 memory and some more NVIDIA GPUs.

279
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:39,040
It looks like they're sort of going at this with a pretty reasonable expectation.

280
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,400
This is, at least, I'm just reading the words from Chris Suffen, I think.

281
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,760
He's the senior marketing manager at Alienware.

282
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,760
This is a direct quote.

283
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:51,280
He said, we expect that the SteamOS catalog is going to strengthen at the end of the year.

284
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
What do you think, Wesley?

285
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
He knows stuff, doesn't he?

286
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
It sounds like he does.

287
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,400
What do you think he knows?

288
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,880
I'm not sure, but I'm really curious.

289
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,880
I think I have a hint, because this is a further comment.

290
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,800
He says, Vulkan will speed up transition for SteamOS to AAA content.

291
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,520
So maybe he thinks a lot of big games are going to be shipping with Vulkan support at

292
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
the end of the year.

293
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
That would be cool.

294
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,880
So is $8.99 the price point for you?

295
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,880
$7.49 is the low price for an i5.

296
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,800
Do you ever go for the low price?

297
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,360
GTX 960, 8 gigs of RAM.

298
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,280
You know, actually, Wes, so you're going to get two cores with an i5, and you're going

299
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,200
to get four cores with an i7, in reality.

300
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,480
They're both shipping with a GTX 960 GPU, both shipping with 8 gigabytes of RAM, both

301
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,280
shipping with 802.11 AC Wi-Fi, and I hope Ethernet.

302
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,320
One difference, though, is 500 gig hard drive in the cheaper one, one terabyte hard drive

303
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,320
in the bigger one.

304
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,160
But to be honest with you, I'm more likely to crack that thing open and put a SSD.

305
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,160
I assume it wouldn't be too hard to just replace that.

306
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
If I could.

307
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,920
I mean, part of me thinks, how great are these games under Linux if they're optimized for

308
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,020
more than two cores?

309
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,020
Is that a thing?

310
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,560
I mean, I have seen that it is a thing, but is it that common of a thing that it's worth

311
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,240
going from $750 to $900?

312
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
Maybe not.

313
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,720
Especially if I'm not really interested in a spinning-rest terabyte hard drive?

314
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,000
And you're going to do aftermarket modifications anyway.

315
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,320
But what do you think of that price, $7.49 for the entry?

316
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,240
A little steep, but if you really don't want to assemble something yourself, you want to

317
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,680
just have a dedicated appliance and you're in on your Steam library and you don't have

318
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,960
a lot of Windows-only games or the games you do like maybe will be here in the end of the

319
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
year, maybe it would work.

320
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,840
I don't know if the i5 is quad-core.

321
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
Is it?

322
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,800
I thought the i5 was dual-core with hyper-threading.

323
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
No, it's quad.

324
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,080
Well, then I definitely would just get the i5, I think.

325
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,760
So what's the i7?

326
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,760
Is it six-core?

327
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
It's quad with hyper-threading.

328
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Oh, OK.

329
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,480
Yeah, I don't really think that's worth it, then.

330
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,200
So Wimpy, what do you think, you've got the Skylake, or not Skylake, the Skull Canyon,

331
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
is that what it is?

332
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,880
The really fancy, like more gamer edition, high-end NUC?

333
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
I'm drooling, Wimpy.

334
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,360
What are your thoughts?

335
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,960
It's exceeded expectations, I'm suitably impressed.

336
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:17,520
So it's got the Skylake i7-6770HQ, so that's a quad-core eight-thread CPU.

337
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:23,320
And it's got the Iris Pro 540, which I think is the top model at the moment.

338
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,720
And my last NUC, which I got in November last year, was the NUC that was the best at the

339
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,360
time, so it's the second best.

340
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,720
And this significantly outperforms it, just using the Iris Pro.

341
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:42,260
So the game that I'm most playing is Grid Autosport, and by comparison, that on the

342
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:51,720
old NUC would pump out around 35 frames per second average on low settings at 720p.

343
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:59,880
This new box can do 1080p medium graphics, about 55 frames per second peaks at 75 frames

344
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,560
per second, so significantly better.

345
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:10,260
But the reason I've got it, the project for the future, is it's got Thunderbolt, and I

346
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:16,400
want to experiment with an external GPU connected over Thunderbolt later in the year.

347
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,000
I would be very curious to see how that goes.

348
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,320
Honestly if that worked, I would be in almost instantaneously.

349
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:28,600
Because see, for example, I have not had as much success with Iris gaming.

350
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,540
I have played some games, but then there's like a new Formula One racing game that's

351
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:39,840
come out, AAA racing game, and it's punishing, even on the highest end Nvidia GPU, it's punishing.

352
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:45,440
So there's those edge cases from time to time where you feel limited by the Intel graphics,

353
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,840
but there's such edge cases that if I could plug in an external GPU case and then have

354
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,400
the capability of playing that game when I need it, but then have a quiet, I assume it's

355
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
really quiet, right?

356
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
Yeah, it's silent.

357
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,680
Yeah, see, I'm all about that.

358
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,160
Yeah, that modular, like, okay, boom.

359
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
I like this NUC.

360
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:11,360
It's tiny, but I've got 32 gigs of RAM in it, and it's DDR4, and I've got 128 gig M.2

361
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:18,480
SSD for the OS, and one 1 terabyte M.2 SSD for the home partition.

362
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:28,040
So it has HDMI, DisplayPort Mini, USB-C, USB 3.0, Ethernet, and that's it.

363
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,600
Oh, and there's a couple of front USB ports.

364
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,400
RAM, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, and a charging USB and Thunderbolt.

365
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,400
That's really everything you need, though.

366
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Yeah, definitely.

367
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,180
Yeah, and the thing's tiny.

368
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,020
So if you're familiar with the old form factor NUC, it's a different size.

369
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,880
So if you think of the thinnest NUCs, it's like two of those side by side, but a bit

370
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,160
thinner, and it's got a nifty case.

371
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,400
So it goes for 650 US greenbacks on Newegg.

372
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
See that, I'm sold on.

373
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,200
You think that's a pretty good price?

374
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
That's not bad, right?

375
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,640
Actually, yeah, I suppose so, because it comes with the i7 processor, but I don't think it

376
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
comes with RAM.

377
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,640
Oh, right.

378
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
Yeah, that's a fair percentage.

379
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,880
So you'd have to get RAM and maybe a disk, but I actually, if the performance is there,

380
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,480
I think it's worth it to have, these days, especially in here, like that machine right

381
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,920
there, I would love to have it be silent.

382
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
So interesting, Wimpy.

383
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,260
I will, oh, look at that.

384
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,680
I will say, I'm pretty tempted by one of these.

385
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,840
Maybe not at the moment, because I just don't really need one, but down the road.

386
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
Down the road, yeah.

387
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Yeah.

388
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
I hope they keep making these.

389
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
Skull Canyon.

390
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,200
Yeah, it's a nice device, I'm very impressed.

391
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,400
And if the external GPU worked, it would also make a pretty good...

392
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,040
Yeah, and the only thing about the external GPU, of course, is that you're looking at

393
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,440
like five gigabits per second over the Thunderbolt interface.

394
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:55,200
So when you compare that to PCI Express, it's a lot slower, so it's no good hooking up a

395
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,520
supremely powerful GPU, because it won't be able to saturate the bus.

396
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,420
So I need to do some sums there to figure out what GPU is sensible.

397
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,680
The chat room points out, too, that it's a mobile i7.

398
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:18,280
But really, Skylake, and really even past generation processors, the mobile processors,

399
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,040
just incredible.

400
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,400
I do notice, on the couple of desktops that we built for Linux Fest, there are desktop

401
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,680
machines that we're using for different functions that have six core processors.

402
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,920
That's the new sweet spot.

403
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,400
Six cores is so the sweet spot now.

404
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,440
I love it.

405
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,640
So I'm ready for mobile processors to get that.

406
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,900
Yeah, absolutely.

407
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,560
So the Intel NUC Skull Canyon.

408
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,960
I was thinking that was a good one.

409
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,640
Have you tried any Thunderbolt device, Wimpy?

410
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,400
Not yet, no.

411
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,480
I haven't got any Thunderbolt devices to plug into it, and I thought I'd wait for the 4.7

412
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,720
kernel to get shipped stable before I start experimenting with that.

413
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,920
Because I believe that's the version that's going to have all of the new Thunderbolt source

414
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,920
in it.

415
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,680
Oh, man.

416
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:08,120
So I'm going to turn off a couple of filters here on my mic just for a second so you guys

417
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,120
can hear.

418
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,760
I don't know if you can hear, but it probably sounds like rushing air.

419
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
Do you hear that?

420
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,840
Can you hear that in the background?

421
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,680
It is storming like crazy outside right now.

422
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,480
And I have some filters on my – here, I just tried to cut some of it out with my mic.

423
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:32,200
But it is – and if it's following what I believe to be the case, what's that – is

424
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,320
it Forecastio?

425
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:42,320
What is that website – what's that website that like Dark Cloud pulls – yeah, Forecast.io.

426
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,040
So if I go look at our current location, I think we are about to have like a huge thunderstorm

427
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
hit.

428
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
So it's –

429
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Well, let's hope we keep power, everyone.

430
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Yeah.

431
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,800
It could be – the show could be getting disrupted here in a moment because, you know, I feel

432
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,040
like these days, honestly, I feel like I live in a freaking rainforest.

433
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
I don't know what's up.

434
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
I don't anymore.

435
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,200
I just feel like – I feel like I live where it's constantly storming and rain forest.

436
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,760
So anyways, if you hear loud banging in the background or if we suddenly go away on the

437
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,960
live stream, it's because the storming is picking up.

438
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
It is the great flood.

439
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
Yeah.

440
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
It's raining like crazy.

441
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
Can you see out the window?

442
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
Oh, yeah.

443
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Absolutely.

444
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
Can you see out there right now?

445
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Yeah.

446
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
All right.

447
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
So we're going to move on.

448
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,760
I want to talk about – well, a couple of things that came out of Apple's WWDC keynote

449
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,000
that are worth mentioning for the open source community.

450
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,560
I always feel weird about this after it happens because WWDC comes around, and then it's

451
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,360
like this big awkward time for us Linux users.

452
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
Exactly.

453
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,360
Very well said.

454
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
I feel the same way.

455
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,360
Because sometimes some cool stuff is announced.

456
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,360
You're like –

457
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,160
But you don't want to feel that excited about it, but you're kind of interested, and you're

458
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,160
still –

459
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,920
So then sometimes you're like motivated to like – yeah, like bash it.

460
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,320
Because you want to like distance yourself from it.

461
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Right.

462
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,160
Is that why you've been Googling butterFS so much, Chris?

463
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
Exactly.

464
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,440
So there's just a couple of things I wanted to mention that – well, one is a feature

465
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,800
that was announced at WWDC that we can already do on Linux.

466
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,880
I'll tell you about that.

467
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:11,440
And the other – I bet you can guess what this one is – is a solid response to a rather

468
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,760
infamous rant of mine.

469
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,600
But first, I'm going to tell you about our friends over at DigitalOcean.

470
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,720
Boy, speaking of storage, DigitalOcean has their block storage beta rolling out.

471
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,720
Noah got in on it.

472
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,720
Oh, did he?

473
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Yeah, I'm not in on it.

474
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
I'm not yet either.

475
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
Oh, you got to tell me when you get in.

476
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,020
So DigitalOcean is a really easy, straightforward cloud hosting provider.

477
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:34,600
You want to go spin up a Linux rig that's a bare bones Linux rig, or one that's got

478
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,400
the entire application stack for whatever you might need.

479
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,880
Say you want to go experiment with Nextcloud, or say you want to try something like Sync

480
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,880
thing or BitTorrent Sync.

481
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,880
That's a great idea.

482
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
Yeah.

483
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,880
It's perfect for that.

484
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,000
But the price point starting at $5 a month, the price is easy to swallow, so you could

485
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,760
just experiment and test.

486
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,160
But then if you want to go into production, well, these systems are all backed by SSDs.

487
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,040
They have data centers all over the world.

488
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,760
They have tier one bandwidth.

489
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,400
They have 40 gigabit E connectors into the hypervisor, like the NUCs – or the NUCs

490
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,000
– the NICs – the NUCs.

491
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,560
Not the same thing.

492
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,560
Network interface cards.

493
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,400
40 gigabit E network interface cards.

494
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,120
I love that.

495
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,040
For $5 a month, you get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte

496
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
of transfer.

497
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,640
And then they have the best interface to manage it on top of that.

498
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,600
A really slick, easy-to-use UI that's simple for beginners, but powerful enough for actual

499
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
experts.

500
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,920
That's like one of those unicorns that never actually seems to happen.

501
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,920
Whoa!

502
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Lightning strike!

503
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
Lightning!

504
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Digital ocean.

505
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
There we go.

506
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,920
Yeah.

507
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,920
Digital ocean.

508
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
Nailed it.

509
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,040
See, that's the cloud right there, responding to how awesome digital ocean is.

510
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
They really are awesome.

511
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,760
That's the power of the digital ocean cloud.

512
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,800
Just promise me something.

513
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Come here, close.

514
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,400
You gotta do me a solid, okay?

515
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,720
You gotta use that promo code, DOUNPLUGGED.

516
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,640
That way I can pay for that lightning strike hole in the ceiling.

517
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,640
DOUNPLUGGED.

518
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,200
One word lowercase, $10 credit.

519
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
You got that?

520
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Thank you.

521
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
That's all I ask for.

522
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Chris needs you, folks.

523
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
DigitalOcean.com.

524
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

525
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,720
Thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

526
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,720
That was funny, man, because I saw that lightning strike out of the corner of my eye, because

527
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,160
it's just right out of the window there.

528
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,680
So anyways, by the way, one other thing about DigitalOcean.

529
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,280
For those of you that are kernel Linux crazy, they do have a how to provision and manage

530
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,000
Docker with CentOS.

531
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's possible.

532
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
It's possible over at DigitalOcean.

533
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
But why?

534
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Go check it out.

535
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
All right.

536
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
So I teased it just really quickly.

537
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,240
Did you guys, anybody in the Mumba room have a guess on what the news out of WWDC is that

538
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,560
I actually am kind of happy about?

539
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
Anybody have a guess?

540
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
Mumba room.

541
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560
New file format system?

542
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,560
Yeah.

543
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,560
You got it.

544
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
The new APFS.

545
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:58,200
Apple's new file system, copy on write metadata, native file encryption, instant cloning, snapshots.

546
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,800
Don't call it ZFS.

547
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,120
It's not ZFS.

548
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,120
Don't call it ButterFS.

549
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,560
Although, you know what?

550
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,160
It's probably very closely more, it's probably more like ButterFS than ZFS.

551
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,160
It probably is.

552
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,600
Are they saying that it's not going to run well?

553
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
Bump bump.

554
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,600
Oh.

555
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,600
Bump bump.

556
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,600
A couple of interesting things about this.

557
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:23,280
It is, they say, I don't know exactly what this means, but they say it is a 64-bit in

558
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,600
node numbering support system.

559
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:30,760
It has been designed specifically for SSDs and flash storage, not for spinning disk.

560
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760
That's the part.

561
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
I don't quite know what they mean.

562
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,680
Perhaps this is a file system that presumes it will not be using the SATA interface to

563
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
talk to it.

564
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
Oh, wouldn't that be interesting?

565
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,680
Yeah.

566
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,400
Perhaps it'll just talk directly to the memory chips.

567
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,840
That's a possibility.

568
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,120
It also will not be available for a while, so it's not like it's rolling out anytime

569
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,400
soon, but here's the interesting tidbit for the open source community.

570
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,720
I normally wouldn't have actually even worth, I wouldn't have mentioned this in the past,

571
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:07,800
but since they actually delivered on Swift, in their documentation right now, they say,

572
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,600
just like they kind of promised in the past for other things, a developer preview of Apple's

573
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,960
file system was included in OS 10, or now it's supposed to call it Mac OS 10.12, it's

574
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,320
their own documentation, Wes.

575
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:26,320
Apple plans to document and publish APFS volume format when the Apple file system is released

576
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,160
in 27.

577
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:34,240
Now, they say an open source implementation is not available at this time, but when they

578
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,240
publish it in 2017, they plan to open source it.

579
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Oh, neat.

580
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,680
Now, the question is, will it be something that already works with Linux, does it be

581
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,920
immediately useful, or something that just works on Mac OS X and does pretty much useless?

582
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,200
Yeah, well, probably the best case scenario will be you'll eventually be able to load

583
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,440
APFS support, like you can load HFS or NTFS support, right, because you know they're not

584
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,440
going to GPL it.

585
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,960
Yeah, the best it'll be is a Fuse module.

586
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,080
Yeah, exactly.

587
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,800
And that, I guess, will at least make compatibility a little easier for us Linux users that have

588
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,800
to interact with Mac users that somehow mistakenly formatted like a thumb drive or something

589
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,800
with this.

590
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,520
I mean, they can't GPL it.

591
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,600
It will pretty much make them make GPL the whole kernel.

592
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,520
Yeah, so you know that's not going to happen, but the fact that they are going to open source

593
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,960
is at least notable, and I believe they'll actually do it.

594
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
You don't think so?

595
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
What?

596
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
What?

597
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,960
What?

598
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,800
They said when they first announced FaceTime that they were going to open source, and they

599
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,840
never did because they got slapped with a lawsuit.

600
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,960
And so it is entirely possible that someone will slap them with a patent claim and say

601
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,600
that we own some part of that file system, you can't open source it, and then that shuts

602
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,600
that down.

603
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,840
So they've made all this big pronouncement, but they don't actually technically have to

604
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,080
do it if someone else comes along and tells them not to.

605
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,640
I bet the case with this though is they've been working on this for quite a few years.

606
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:03,240
I'm betting that they have been owning a lot of the IP of this as they've gone along because

607
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,800
their intention is for this to run from everything from the watch to the desktop and everything

608
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
in between.

609
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,960
So they're probably crossing their eyes and crossing the teeth.

610
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,520
No, you had it right first time.

611
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
Probably did.

612
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
I find it interesting.

613
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
Think different, Chris.

614
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,920
They're doing atomic file transactions.

615
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,880
They talk about snapshots and rollbacks.

616
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,120
These are all things I like.

617
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Trim support.

618
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
So anyways.

619
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,880
I wonder how long until they think it's production ready, quote, unquote.

620
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,760
We can't get much worse than HFS, so they don't have a high bar.

621
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
That's a fair point.

622
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Yeah.

623
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,840
Is there any indication how long this has been incubating for?

624
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
I don't know.

625
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,840
I think some people speculate.

626
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
The number I've heard kicked around is seven years.

627
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Wow.

628
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:54,640
No, it has to be less just because I've been actually monitoring their hiring job boards

629
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,480
and they've been last three years hiring extensively kernel developers, which I am assuming some

630
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,560
of them will be for file system stuff.

631
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,720
So it's three years tops that I will claim.

632
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
Yeah.

633
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,380
I guess we might know if they open source it because in the case of Swift, when they

634
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,120
open source Swift, they include the entire commit log.

635
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
So we might know.

636
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,120
That's a good point.

637
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
That'd be interesting.

638
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Yeah.

639
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,040
Oh, here comes more thunder.

640
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:24,440
So the other feature, I live streamed the keynote because I figure a lot of people that

641
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,000
listen to Jupyter broadcasting don't have Macs.

642
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,080
They have Linux rigs and the only official stream from Apple, it requires that you use

643
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,080
Safari.

644
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,080
Oh, really?

645
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,080
Yeah.

646
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,080
So lame.

647
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,720
But always somebody posts like an alternative RTMP stream somewhere.

648
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,640
So what I do is I always try to rebroadcast that so that people can just go to the JB live

649
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,440
page on whatever device they want because we're available on the TV, we're available

650
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,040
on their mobile, we're available on their web.

651
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,880
So I figure just make it easy for our audience that would just want to watch it.

652
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,880
Totally.

653
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,720
And so I do commentary along with the chat room and stuff.

654
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,720
And one of the things that everybody in the chat room seemed to universally love was this

655
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:05,920
new picture in picture feature of Mac OS X or whatever, Mac OS Sierra.

656
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
Did you see this?

657
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,140
Where any HTML5 video could be popped out and then you could drag it and it could stay

658
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,560
persistent on top of all applications across all desktops.

659
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,680
And fear not, that feature is already available in Linux via MPV.

660
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,680
Nice.

661
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,760
Mr. InnoGoGo made a link in the Linux Action Show subreddit where he just gives you the

662
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,360
command that you do in MPV and it can pop up into a little picture in picture window

663
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,800
like that and you can move it around.

664
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,920
He even shows how you can do it on Windows if you were so inclined.

665
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,560
I was going to say, one of the things we've got, I mean, window managers, man, we should

666
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
be able to get that down.

667
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,560
Right?

668
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Yeah.

669
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
Yeah.

670
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,560
So that was like the one feature.

671
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
I was like, hmm, that's okay.

672
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,560
It's okay.

673
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
This one's cooler though, the MPV.

674
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
You don't need to use the window manager to do it.

675
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Yeah.

676
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Right.

677
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,560
Yeah.

678
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,560
I guess other than that, I mean, was there any other features that you heard about and

679
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
any by the mumble room?

680
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
Feel free to chime in to that.

681
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,200
You're like, oh, as a Linux user, I kind of, I kind of would like to have that.

682
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:04,240
I feel that they should totally, you know, since we still are dealing with X, maybe show

683
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,240
us what they're using.

684
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,120
That will be cool.

685
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Actually useful maybe.

686
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
I don't know.

687
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:15,680
Yeah, I didn't, I didn't really, I don't want to go, I just want to make a comment.

688
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,320
I think the situation for Mac hardware right now is pretty poor.

689
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,560
It really is.

690
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:25,000
And I think there's an opportunity here for Linux because a lot of the things that drive

691
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,560
people to, originally, that drove people to Mac OS was a nice graphical interface with

692
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,680
a strong Unix underpinning, which is a lot like elementary OS, for example, or something

693
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,360
like that, or Ubuntu desktop, we're about to talk about, that people are now aware of

694
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,720
these alternatives.

695
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,600
And it allows you to buy from any hardware vendor you want.

696
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,560
And the problem is, in a lot of cases, Apple has set a pretty high bar for hardware quality,

697
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,740
but it's not an impossible bar to surpass.

698
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,200
And other, more and more manufacturers are doing so or getting close.

699
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,880
And the problem is, is legitimately, you look at some of Apple's high-end hardware right

700
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,440
now, like just as a thought experiment.

701
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,040
Let's say you decided you needed to get yourself a very high-end workstation from Apple.

702
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,520
Well, first of all, the first thing you'll notice when you go to buy from Apple is the

703
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,440
only thing they're really advertising is their iOS devices.

704
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,520
It's a little discouraging.

705
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
You can't really...

706
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,480
Oh, people still buy desktop computers?

707
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
Yeah.

708
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,920
So if we go look at the Mac, for example, and say we want to get the Mac Pro because

709
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,280
we want something that has more than four cores.

710
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,400
So I want something that has more than four cores, maybe because I have a large encoding

711
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,240
workflow, or there's all kinds of situations where you need a lot of CPU.

712
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,880
So if you want to get the Mac Pro right now, you are legitimately forced to use hardware

713
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,880
that came out like three years ago, and the starting price is $3,000.

714
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,880
Oh, man.

715
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,400
And that's with not a very competitive system.

716
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,240
This system is significantly less competitive than the computer I am showing it on right

717
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,240
now legitimately.

718
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,560
So if I wanted to go...I am displaying this on a quad-core...or I'm sorry, a six-core

719
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:08,840
Skylake system, and this is three generations old quad-core starting at $3,000.

720
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:15,640
Now what's even more egregious is, besides the 12 gigs of RAM and the only 256 gigabytes

721
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:22,800
of storage, what's actually the most egregious thing on this page is the AMD Fire Pro D300

722
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,000
GPU with two gigs of RAM.

723
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,720
It is an ancient, ancient graphics card.

724
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,800
And to upgrade, the best thing you can get is Fire D700s, which are like four-generation

725
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
old GPUs.

726
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,240
They were legitimately a generation old when this Mac Pro shipped.

727
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:43,720
And the best you can get is a four-generation old graphics card, two of them for $1,000.

728
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
That's crazy.

729
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,640
You'd think there would be a lot of professionals that want to do this, especially with like

730
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,640
machine learning, etc.

731
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,360
Like there's so many stuff where you really do want like a nice GPU for professional work.

732
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,600
I will claim that this is actually part of the smart move from Apple.

733
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,760
As a developer, what has screwed up Windows developers has been that they're constantly

734
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,760
shifting.

735
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,880
You don't have a stable platform.

736
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,360
People choose Ubuntu because they have the LTS and they can be sure that they target

737
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,360
that.

738
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,540
The fact that Apple doesn't go crazy on adopting new things so fast allows for someone to master

739
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:23,680
and craft for that platform and then sell on that platform, which means profitability.

740
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:32,360
I would argue that Windows XP and Windows 7 are pretty reliable targets as far as developer

741
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,360
platforms target.

742
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,280
But also, I think your argument would be probably easier to swallow if they reduce the price

743
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,280
over time.

744
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,720
They're still charging the original price when they launched that thing years ago.

745
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,760
And I think the core point here is your scenario may be okay for some developers, but I think

746
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,040
there's a group of people out there, even people who have enough money, who look at

747
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,280
that and say that is just unfair to the customer.

748
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:04,440
And I think I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, but in general, their platform does pay more.

749
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:07,560
You develop for Windows, the money you make, you develop for Android, the money you make

750
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,280
and you develop for iOS, the money you make, you do your math.

751
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:17,000
I think perhaps people like Leo Laporte are a harbinger of exactly what I'm talking about.

752
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,520
People who can afford to spend more but look at the commitment that Apple has to the Mac

753
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,720
platform and go, Apple is way more committed to the iOS platform and now to their new services

754
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,240
division and potentially to even building a car and they're not committed to their

755
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,680
desktop and hardware platform anymore as they have been in the past.

756
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,960
And so I can see very easily how people like Leo Laporte would look at that and go, well,

757
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,440
I don't want something from the Microsoft camp because I don't like what they're doing

758
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,840
with Windows and I don't like what Apple is doing with their hardware, so I'm just going

759
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:52,640
to go with Linux, I'll find a desktop eventually that works for me and it has to be a certain

760
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,960
enthusiast that's willing to do this, but I'll find a desktop environment that works

761
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,600
for me and I'll find a piece of hardware that works for me and I will now just manage that

762
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,120
marriage of hardware and software and not outsource it to Apple like I have in the past.

763
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,040
And I think that's exactly what's happening right now, I just think it's a slow trickle

764
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,400
that's going to speed up, especially as they continue to ignore their hardware.

765
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,880
They just did their only one big event a year, one that is for developers and they didn't

766
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,040
release a single piece of hardware for developers to use to develop for their platform.

767
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,280
They have all developers enough for us to buy hardware that has years old components

768
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,280
in it.

769
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,520
That's a pretty bad state.

770
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:34,440
I mean I know it has a cool Apple glowy logo on it, but at a certain point that brand attachment

771
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,480
only goes so far and the practical person in you goes, wow, I can go get a ThinkPad

772
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,760
or a Sputnik or a System76 or something.

773
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,280
That's where the System76 really starts looking attractive, or similar offerings.

774
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,720
Devices that people are targeting are also inferior devices anyway, aren't they?

775
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,080
That's kind of what the point is, it's like if I'm targeting this inferior device and

776
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:02,160
I can test it or run it in the developer machine I have right now, something's very wrong then.

777
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,880
I can target those devices that they're building right now, the phones and the TVs and whatever

778
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:12,640
the car system is, they're all going to be inferior and that's where the clients are.

779
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,120
So if me as a developer, I'm buying a Mac as a developer, I don't need the super fancy

780
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,640
thing, I need access to the platform.

781
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,440
I need better software tools, which is the services that they are improving.

782
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,320
I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

783
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,320
Pretty much.

784
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:32,480
So did you guys hear about this rumor that Samsung is going to completely dump Android?

785
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,760
Did you see this?

786
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,880
How could this be?

787
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,720
But apparently, this is from Fossbytes.com, so I don't know where they got their source.

788
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,400
But they claim that the plan is...

789
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,720
Oh, from the Korea Times.

790
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,120
Yeah, oh yeah, there you go, thank you, from the Korea Times.

791
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:54,200
They say that they did a launch in India, they sold lots of devices, millions of devices.

792
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:00,080
The devices are being very competitive, they've said, and they've had a low return rate, customers

793
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,400
are happy with the Tizen based phones.

794
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:10,040
And according to this, they seem to think it's a great opportunity to go from their

795
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:17,640
watches to the phones to their refrigerators to their television, Tizen, all the things.

796
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:21,400
They say they've had 64 million phones sold they're running Tizen, and that it's proving

797
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,960
to be very competitive.

798
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,040
That's a lot of phones, I mean, not globally, not to the whole phone market, but just as

799
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,040
a unit, that's interesting.

800
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,200
I wonder how well they really do work.

801
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,960
You think this is legit, Popey?

802
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:38,120
Yep, I called it, I've been saying this for a very long time, that what Samsung are doing

803
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:43,800
with their S apps is building a community and a familiarity with their applications

804
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:50,240
and their app ecosystem and locking people into their app ecosystem rather than the Android

805
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
ecosystem.

806
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
But doesn't that...

807
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,760
Normal people know two things, they know Apple phones and Samsung phones.

808
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,760
Yes, that's very true.

809
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,020
Normal people don't know about all those others.

810
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,160
And when you're on a Samsung phone, you have all these Samsung things.

811
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:07,640
My theory has been for some time that Samsung will just swap out the underneath and they'll

812
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,120
rebuild all their S apps for Tizen and the user won't care because they'll still be locked

813
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,440
into all the same S apps that they had on Android but on Tizen.

814
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,960
We can stop complaining about TouchWiz.

815
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:23,840
And if you look at a Tizen phone, it looks a lot like TouchWiz on Android.

816
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,000
But hasn't the S apps been universally rejected by users?

817
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,960
Don't people hate the S apps?

818
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,960
I don't know.

819
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:38,160
I mean, the places where these people who apparently have bought millions of Tizen phones

820
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,280
don't really have the option of all the G apps.

821
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,040
What's the size of the people that hate them versus the size of people who just use them

822
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
because they're there?

823
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,040
I don't even know.

824
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,040
I don't have the answer.

825
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,040
Yeah, default is game.

826
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,040
Yeah, default is game.

827
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,040
However, what I would say is I subscribe to a monthly mail that I get about the top 20

828
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,800
apps in the Tizen store and I get this email every month.

829
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,240
I signed up to be a developer on the Tizen store just so I can get this email.

830
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,040
And it tells me which of the apps.

831
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,320
And I've been looking at this for a year and it's the same 10 or 20 apps in the store for

832
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,640
like the last year.

833
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,800
Every so often a new one will come in, a new game or a new media player app or something.

834
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,520
But it's basically the same 20 apps.

835
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,860
So I don't think they have a massive developer community.

836
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,220
And I wouldn't be surprised if they're using the Android runtime to leverage Android applications.

837
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,440
That's what I was thinking.

838
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,720
So the number one app in there is WhatsApp and I'm pretty certain that's an Android app

839
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,160
and not actually a native Tizen app.

840
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,920
That's the response to the chatroom too.

841
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:38,480
Of course, if they can run Android apps, do you think they could even do the Play Store

842
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
API?

843
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,280
Is that possible?

844
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,280
It's possible.

845
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,520
How can you run Play Store API on another OS?

846
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,640
The Play Store is Java.

847
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,320
Tizen is JavaScript and HTML.

848
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,880
But everything all uses the Linux kernel all in the base anyway.

849
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,040
Android is pretty much Linux plus Java.

850
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,440
Tizen is Linux plus JavaScript.

851
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:06,480
So they can just shove the Android or at least their Java runtime in and it will be working.

852
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,480
I see.

853
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,480
How does this work?

854
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,480
It's not taking into account the display server either.

855
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,320
Tizen can use Wayland.

856
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,320
Just like Sailfish.

857
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,040
The Surface Flinger, a display server for Android.

858
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,280
Yeah, well, I guess they can.

859
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,560
I wouldn't want to use it.

860
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:25,200
I would more want to go the Sailfish way and do Wayland on the mobile platform anyway.

861
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,120
So heavens, there was a report just like a few days ago.

862
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,920
Just came out, said, mobile users are not really installing apps anymore.

863
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,720
They get five, six, seven apps that they use on a daily basis or frequently and then they

864
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:41,240
pretty much, they might install something but they never use it.

865
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,080
Do you think that factors into how Tizen could perhaps blow up larger than Android?

866
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,600
Because you say you think it could go bigger than Android.

867
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:54,240
Probably because of the developer base or the developers for JavaScript versus the enterprise

868
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:02,200
Java who have just migrated over to Android as a benefit, but I guess they could get even

869
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:08,480
bigger because one, JavaScript applications are all instant apps versus Android's new

870
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:15,720
Android M or what, N's instant app new feature.

871
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:22,120
Well, I think it's anyway, come on, Google's been pouring millions of dollars into JavaScript

872
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:27,480
execution better than Java can ever be and you know, lawsuit crap going on.

873
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,120
I think we look at it from too much of a technical possibility standpoint.

874
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:38,360
I think maybe outside the US this could happen, but I just don't ever see this happening to

875
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:47,040
... As long as Samsung in the US is trying to go against the iPhone, I don't see it happening.

876
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,960
Chris, can I just point out how many billions of people live outside the US?

877
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:51,960
Right.

878
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,800
You know, I could see this totally taking, that's exactly my point is maybe in terms

879
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,560
of scale, essentially they will have done this percentage wise just by doing this outside

880
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,820
the US.

881
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:06,680
But I don't think inside the US or any market I should say where they're commercially going

882
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,080
after iOS devices.

883
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,640
It just doesn't seem like that's going to be happening, that you can switch to a new

884
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,640
platform and be competitive.

885
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,640
Yeah.

886
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,640
I don't know.

887
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,640
It just doesn't seem like-

888
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:23,560
But to target the TV and Samsung TVs are more than the iOS or whatever other TV, well that's

889
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,760
a very compelling argument that nobody really has right now.

890
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,080
Sure target the TV, target the phones, target the cars, target the watches and see where

891
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,080
it takes them.

892
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,160
And they have their Chromebooks too.

893
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,600
So if they, you know, it's a step there.

894
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,360
That'd be interesting.

895
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:37,720
That would be interesting.

896
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,400
Maybe soon we'll be running a Tizen desktop fork thing right here on the show.

897
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
All right.

898
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,400
All right.

899
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,400
I'll get into that.

900
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,760
I would love to, like even if I had to import it, I'd love to get that.

901
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,920
It's funny because I say that I don't think Samsung will ever do this in the US.

902
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,920
Personally I'd love it if they do it.

903
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,920
It'd be fun to try.

904
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,920
I would love it.

905
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,880
Like from an enthusiast standpoint, I'd be like, yes please.

906
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:04,280
A large scale manufacturer who can build high quality products relatively and ship them

907
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,280
on a scale where I can actually go into a store and buy them.

908
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,280
Yeah.

909
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,280
That would be great.

910
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,920
But I don't know.

911
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:18,960
I just linked the Intel demonstrating Tizen on an Intel A7 Ultrabook in 2013.

912
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,560
All right Hawkins, would you like to have the last word on this one?

913
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:29,960
I just want to say that with Samsung, if we think back about the Nokia Symbian operating

914
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:36,440
system, which Samsung also had access to, they didn't do any development when they did

915
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,760
have access to the Symbian operating system.

916
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,120
It's true.

917
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,120
Yeah.

918
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:47,000
Maybe they're going to compete with Google in like the ad space and make Advertisen.

919
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Ooh.

920
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Ba-dump-bump.

921
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,160
And on that note, why don't we-

922
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,160
Let's move on.

923
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,160
Let's talk about Ting.

924
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,200
Let's talk about Ting.

925
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,360
Whenever you get your device, be it a Tizen device, an Android device, an iOS device,

926
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:04,440
a feature phone, or even a Blackberry, heck I don't care, Ting is honey badger about this.

927
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,440
It's real simple.

928
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,280
They got CDMA and GSM and you pay for what you use.

929
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,680
So you get a SIM card, you put it in your device, and you pay for what you use.

930
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,040
It's $6 for the line.

931
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,040
You want to have 10 lines, it's $6.

932
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,860
You want to have one line, it's $6.

933
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,860
You just pay for your usage, there's no contract.

934
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,160
It's really this simple.

935
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,440
I can't even believe I... Even after all this time, I can't really believe it's that

936
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,440
simple.

937
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,200
Hopefully, hopefully you do and you're willing to try it because it really is a game changer.

938
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,240
I save over $2,000 a year by going to Ting.

939
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,720
Average Ting monthly bill per line, $23.

940
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,720
That's for your smartphone.

941
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,440
You know, they just take your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes, add them up

942
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,440
and that's what you pay.

943
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,160
You got CDMA and GSM to choose from and you can either buy a device from Ting directly,

944
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,480
which is unlocked and you own it, there's no contract.

945
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,720
Or you can bring a device and they'll give you a Ting credit if you go to linux.ting.com.

946
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,180
linux.ting.com will also take money off your first device.

947
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,520
They have great customer service.

948
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,960
You speak to real human beings.

949
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,800
They have a super nice dashboard that gives you features you never thought a mobile carrier

950
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,800
would give you right in the webpage.

951
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,800
I love that.

952
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,040
Same with the Android app too.

953
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:12,600
I don't use the Android app as much or there's also an iOS app, but that webpage, I just

954
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,600
love it.

955
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,600
I love it and I love the...

956
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:17,400
Everything you need to do is right there.

957
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,200
Just as an example, we have a couple of extra lines we turn on every now and then just when

958
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,560
we have people in town and we can disable them.

959
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,220
The process is very straightforward.

960
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,220
I love it.

961
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:31,600
The fact that we have CDMA and GSM means that when we're up north at Linux Fest Northwest,

962
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,760
we use the CDMA network and when we're down here in Arlington, we use the GSM network

963
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,920
and we get amazing service in both locations.

964
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,920
And you get to choose.

965
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,280
I love it.

966
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,400
Try going there right now.

967
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,400
Check them out.

968
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,400
linux.ting.com.

969
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,160
$6 per line.

970
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,160
That's nuts.

971
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,920
You can also call them at 1-855-TING-FTW.

972
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,080
Talk to a real human being.

973
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,160
It is mobile that makes sense.

974
00:46:55,160 --> 00:47:01,960
linux.ting.com and up on their blog right now, they have an article about using Ting

975
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,440
for gamers which is really cool.

976
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,160
So we're going to talk about snap packages.

977
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,840
We got to talk about snap packages but first before we get into the snap package discussion

978
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:16,720
which this is huge news today, there's also a little bit of news this week, just something

979
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,000
I want to touch on before we run away with the rest of the show and that's the new Loki

980
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,160
beta that's out.

981
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,880
The elementary OS folks put out a beta of Loki.

982
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,360
It's totes early stuff here.

983
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,800
It is not meant for your daily driver.

984
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,280
You shouldn't use it if you are expecting a stable, reliable desktop.

985
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,120
It's really to give them feedback.

986
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,140
That's what this is about.

987
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:41,200
But it's something that's kind of interesting because it's sort of a closely watched distribution

988
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:47,640
because it doesn't do traditional betas and development in the sort of daily release tradition

989
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,760
that a lot of distributions do like when there's a new version of Ubuntu itself coming out

990
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,040
at any point in the development cycle, you could go get the latest ISO or you could go

991
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,720
jump in at Fedora Rahai at any point or Debian unstable, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,

992
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,040
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

993
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,260
But that's not how elementary OS does it.

994
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:08,240
So when they actually put a flag down on the ground and say, OK, the beta is out.

995
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,240
You can go try it.

996
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,080
We had to give it a look.

997
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,360
And so besides reiterating that beta means beta, they say that they've shipped a new

998
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,000
set of toys for developers.

999
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,580
They've upgraded the notifications, better notifications.

1000
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,880
No unsafe software sources.

1001
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,400
But also there's a few things like a new app center or whatever they call it in there and

1002
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,400
stuff like that.

1003
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,400
Tell me about it, Wes.

1004
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,400
What do you think?

1005
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,400
What are your first impressions?

1006
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,400
You've been running it this morning.

1007
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,400
Yes, I have.

1008
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,040
I'm doing it right here, doing all my show prep, et cetera, on it.

1009
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,160
So far, mostly good.

1010
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,720
I mean, there's like some small things you can tell that they're still working stuff

1011
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,640
out like if there's no default associated thing with.deb files anymore.

1012
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,520
So if you want to install those, you can't double click, you need to go into the terminal,

1013
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,520
et cetera.

1014
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,120
You can change that if you want to.

1015
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:57,480
But I will say it installed easily, very quick.

1016
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,480
It really didn't break anything.

1017
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,360
It installed nicely on the three other operating systems I have here.

1018
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,360
Loads really fast.

1019
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:06,800
It has a very smooth graphical, not a lot of like you don't see the frame buffer terminal

1020
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:07,800
or anything like that.

1021
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,040
It really goes like right to the desktop, loads up.

1022
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:15,240
And in typical elementary style, the animations are smooth.

1023
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,240
Might not be a lot there.

1024
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:21,200
But I admit for my own tastes, elementary is just enough different from GNOME that it's

1025
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,380
like the commands are different and the shortcuts are different, like the layout, but it's similar.

1026
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,380
But it's really nice.

1027
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,320
And just all the little things, you can tell it's polished.

1028
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,840
You can tell like every feature that they've put in, they really want to be nice and to

1029
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,840
be complete.

1030
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:42,840
So do you, when you're using it, do you have the sense that it is indeed a Ubuntu family

1031
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,540
member, or does it feel like its own beast?

1032
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:48,600
And so what I'm asking you is, do you sort of have the, do you sort of have the background

1033
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,440
confidence knowing that you're using a desktop that's part of a larger ecosystem, or does

1034
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,280
it feel like it's sort of off on its own island?

1035
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:00,000
On the surface, I mean, it doesn't, there's not a lot of clues.

1036
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,560
Here I am looking at the app center, and it's kind of just, it's very minimally, very minimally

1037
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,560
branded.

1038
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,200
It's just kind of, yeah.

1039
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,920
But as more of a power user, I do appreciate that I can just open a terminal, apt-get is

1040
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,920
right there.

1041
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,920
I see that.

1042
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:14,920
I see everything.

1043
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,760
So this here is the, they call it the app center.

1044
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,600
We don't have a visual of it because Wes's machine isn't hooked up to the capture.

1045
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:30,320
So this is their own custom app that, or is it based on, is it based on GNOME software?

1046
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,320
I'm not sure.

1047
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,320
We should look into that.

1048
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,480
I think it's actually based on GNOME software.

1049
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:34,760
It does look similar, yeah.

1050
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:39,900
Yeah, but it looks like it has much nicer categories, broader, yeah.

1051
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,000
So that's a new feature for sure.

1052
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,200
They have the app hub as well.

1053
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,620
What is the app hub running?

1054
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,960
It's a new thing that they're going to do, which is like the app center is going to be

1055
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,480
like the store that you get.

1056
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:57,480
The app hub is where everything is going to be provided from, and like a third-party store

1057
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,480
type thing.

1058
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,360
So that you push to the app hub, the app hub pushes packages to the app center that people

1059
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,360
can install.

1060
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,360
I see.

1061
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,280
Wes, try going into the settings or switchboard or whatever they call it there, and check

1062
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,920
out the new sharing settings in there.

1063
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,440
I guess there's a couple other things, there's new online account plugins, printer support

1064
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,880
replacing the old one, and there's also new mouse.

1065
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:17,880
Oh yeah, here we go.

1066
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,040
Yeah, so what do you see when you go into sharing?

1067
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,480
The first thing is media libraries.

1068
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,880
You can just choose to share music, videos, pictures.

1069
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,880
They're all turned on by default.

1070
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,880
Oh, cool.

1071
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:26,880
All right.

1072
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,880
Oh, no.

1073
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,040
The whole thing is disabled if you enable it.

1074
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,760
All of those are turned on by default.

1075
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,760
Okay.

1076
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,760
Have you checked out, have you gotten any new notifications?

1077
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,080
I guess a new notification indicator was added to the panel.

1078
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:39,440
You know, I have seen a few, and I'm waiting for some processes I'd run with pseudo to

1079
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,440
complete.

1080
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,640
They pop up a little like, oh, hey, your process is done.

1081
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,640
That's nice, isn't it?

1082
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,640
Yes.

1083
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,640
It feels very slick.

1084
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,640
Yeah.

1085
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,640
I like how Fedora does that too.

1086
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,640
I do.

1087
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,640
But just for the terminal.

1088
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,640
So where is their notification tray thingy at?

1089
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,560
They say it goes up in the – oh, okay, yeah, oh, yeah, it's this little bell right

1090
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,280
here, and it has a nice do not disturb toggle.

1091
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,280
Have you seen that?

1092
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,280
Yeah.

1093
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,280
That seems like it will be very useful.

1094
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,280
It's really clean looking.

1095
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,280
It's nice.

1096
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,280
Yeah, that's the thing.

1097
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:06,560
It's like, you know, as someone who does like to tinker and I run Arch, etc., etc.,

1098
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,520
I can see where some of these things might bug me or I might be like, I really wish I

1099
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,840
had that feature or I could do it.

1100
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:15,840
But if you just are using the computer or like especially kind of this laptop, I use

1101
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,320
it for show stuff, but it's not my daily driver, so I don't do a lot of my main project

1102
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,720
work, development, anything on it.

1103
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,280
So if I just want to browse the web and have a laptop that connects to Wi-Fi and suspends

1104
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,760
and comes back every time, it seems like it might not be a bad fit.

1105
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,760
Yeah.

1106
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,040
Anybody else have thoughts about elementary OS and the Mamba Room before we move along?

1107
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,040
I'll probably –

1108
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,040
Yeah, I think –

1109
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,040
Yeah, go ahead.

1110
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,520
That needs to be some – just one quick note.

1111
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:43,000
If you're wanting to use PPAs, you need to install the App Repository tool.

1112
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Yes, you do.

1113
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,000
That's a good point.

1114
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,840
Because by default, they disabled it.

1115
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,960
So there are some considerations like that for like power users that may be more inconvenient

1116
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:51,960
than convenient for you.

1117
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,520
That seems like a pretty clear message there, that it's not for power users.

1118
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,520
Yeah.

1119
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,520
Hmm.

1120
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,520
And that's okay, too.

1121
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,520
That's fine.

1122
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:01,720
I mean, it's not really – not every distribution out there is – it needs to be for me.

1123
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,720
No, right.

1124
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,720
Absolutely.

1125
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,440
Like I may not use it, but it might be something I could recommend for my mom to use, no problem.

1126
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:07,440
Yeah.

1127
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,520
My son is running the last release of elementary OS, and he's been running it for over a year.

1128
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,520
Just totally solid.

1129
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,520
And there are some times where like you need that – you might not like their aesthetic,

1130
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,520
but they do have an aesthetic.

1131
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,520
Yeah.

1132
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,560
And there are some users, especially people who maybe are more designers or artists or

1133
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:24,880
like who have an expectation from other operating systems that it is clean or it is simple or

1134
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,040
it is just pretty in some way, and elementary might fit there, too.

1135
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,040
Mm-hmm.

1136
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:36,480
I think when you look at elements of it, I look at that and go, if I use my computers

1137
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,240
differently, I would – I could see myself really being a good elementary OS user candidate

1138
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:45,800
because I do like the consistent visual language that's just everywhere through the whole

1139
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,800
thing.

1140
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,380
I like that they take care of certain things like the sharing stuff there, like the notification

1141
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:55,080
stuff there, the thought that goes into it, the very consistent – from the moment it

1142
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:59,040
powers up to the desktop, it's very consistent feeling.

1143
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:03,040
That is all indicative of a lot of intention.

1144
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,040
Exactly.

1145
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,920
And that intention, I respect a lot.

1146
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,560
And so when I'm using something and it delights me in a way that I go, oh, wow, somebody really

1147
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:17,940
thought about that, and I have just a brief moment of insight into, they must have really

1148
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,580
agonized over this choice.

1149
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:22,480
And I think to myself, I'm so appreciative that they did that.

1150
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,720
I do enjoy using systems that make me feel that way.

1151
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,200
And that's one of the reasons I like using GNOME because I often feel like there's things

1152
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,320
in GNOME 3 that do that for me.

1153
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,920
So there is a part of me that wishes I could be the perfect user for this.

1154
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:40,000
But then, of course, the software availability would kill me, just kill me, because I would

1155
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,000
want PPAs.

1156
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,200
And I would want to add stuff all the time, and all that.

1157
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,200
And I mean, you can't do it just for cars, right?

1158
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,200
Yeah.

1159
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,200
One install.

1160
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,120
I feel like, though, that I'm obviously going against some of those intentions.

1161
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,120
Right.

1162
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,120
Are you going to break some things?

1163
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,120
Are you going to have to – yeah, you're fighting the system.

1164
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:58,880
Those very intentions I claim to think were great would seem to be in violation.

1165
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,120
However, that all could be changing.

1166
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,120
Right.

1167
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,120
There are new things on the horizon.

1168
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,360
There are things afoot.

1169
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:12,120
Like we mentioned in the intro, there is apparently a Linux packaging cold war that we have been

1170
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,120
on the front line.

1171
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,120
Where do you stand?

1172
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,560
Where do you stand in the war?

1173
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,560
Are we being cray-cray?

1174
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,400
Are we overstating it?

1175
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,440
Or is there actually really some interesting developments?

1176
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,320
All of those things are true.

1177
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:28,640
By the way, links to the Loki beta if you guys want to grab it and let us know what

1178
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,080
you think.

1179
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,080
Have we had a couple of dropouts?

1180
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,080
Oh, okay.

1181
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,080
Yeah.

1182
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,080
Sorry, guys.

1183
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,080
The storm is picking up.

1184
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,080
Sorry about that.

1185
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,080
Can you hear us okay, Wimpy?

1186
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,080
Is it all right?

1187
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,080
I can.

1188
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,080
Good.

1189
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,880
But I remember that you lost a load of stuff once.

1190
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,880
Yeah.

1191
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,880
Yeah.

1192
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:45,880
We have a backup recording going.

1193
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:46,880
Uh-huh.

1194
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,880
I tell you what.

1195
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,880
I tell you what.

1196
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,040
This new OBS rig has worked out unbelievably well.

1197
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:58,040
I was just talking on the livestream like it runs 24-7 and never crashes.

1198
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,480
It just runs, runs, runs.

1199
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:02,080
And Wirecast could not live up to that.

1200
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:06,520
It has shown itself to live up to a workload that Wirecast could never sustain.

1201
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,520
That's awesome.

1202
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:13,720
Wirecast is really to use it fully as a $1,000 product that's been around for a lot of years.

1203
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:19,360
And OBS in terms of life cycle, they rebuilt it not too long ago.

1204
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,880
It's still kind of new.

1205
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,580
And yet when they seem to do releases, at least the versions we've installed so far

1206
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,880
have been extremely reliable.

1207
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,040
Maybe they don't have necessarily all the whizbang features I need at this moment.

1208
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:40,080
But the fact that thing, I mean, it's probably been 20 days that it's ran solid.

1209
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,080
It's really something.

1210
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,960
And we had some issues on Sunday, and it wasn't that machine.

1211
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,960
It was Comcast.

1212
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,120
And when we do have problems, it tends to be Comcast.

1213
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,120
Go figure.

1214
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,120
Open source for the win.

1215
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,120
Yeah.

1216
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,120
Exactly.

1217
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,120
It's really amazing.

1218
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,120
It really is amazing.

1219
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,000
And it helps that...

1220
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,320
What a cool project.

1221
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,680
It helps, too, that it is available on the Linux machines.

1222
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,680
A solid operating system.

1223
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,680
Yeah.

1224
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,680
Because Linux is also very solid.

1225
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:07,680
So I think a solid piece of software running on top of a solid operating system is just

1226
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,920
a really great combo.

1227
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:10,920
And thank you.

1228
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:16,200
Really, the credit there for that system being as good as it is goes really to Rekai and

1229
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,400
Noah, who stayed up all hours of the night, several nights in a row, making it work.

1230
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,400
Right.

1231
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,400
And failed components.

1232
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,400
Yeah.

1233
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,400
Googling like crazy.

1234
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,760
So really the credit goes to the Beard and to Brown Bear.

1235
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:31,440
But we shall move on to Canonical's big announcement, which may solve my software availability complaints

1236
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,640
for elementary OS.

1237
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,800
But first, let's mention Linux Academy.

1238
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,200
In fact, go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1239
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,880
All of you right now, go there and test the link, because we had a bit of an outage the

1240
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,880
other night.

1241
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,880
Oh, no.

1242
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:44,880
Yeah.

1243
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,880
So help me test it.

1244
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,880
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1245
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,600
Then dig around on their website.

1246
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:53,440
They have 2,471 self-paced courses where you can obtain experience and learn as you go

1247
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,300
with scenario-based labs that put you in the middle of everyday common tasks, instructor

1248
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:02,000
mentoring when you need help, and graded server exercises that automatically grades your actions

1249
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,440
so you can see how well you did, which is really nice.

1250
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,440
Really, really nice, especially for those of us that don't test well.

1251
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,960
They, of course, work on Python and, of course, Linux and all the technology around Linux

1252
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,800
and Android and that DevOps category.

1253
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,800
OpenStack, yep.

1254
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,800
Yep.

1255
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:16,800
That's a thing.

1256
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:17,800
Python, Ruby.

1257
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,800
AWS?

1258
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,800
Oh, AWS.

1259
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,800
Fo' show.

1260
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,520
There's also something they're calling social cards, which—

1261
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:24,520
What is this?

1262
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,520
Tell me more.

1263
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,520
I don't know.

1264
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,520
My first thought was like, what?

1265
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,520
Some cards?

1266
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,520
What?

1267
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,520
No.

1268
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,520
They're like, you know, no cards for like learning.

1269
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:36,280
And you can fork them and build upon them, and there's a reputation system built in.

1270
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,280
Wow.

1271
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,280
All of this now in Linux Academy.

1272
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,040
They have a great community of people who are all super motivated, and tons of them

1273
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:46,960
are Jupyter Broadcasting members, that are now going to be, well, if you want at least,

1274
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,640
involved in the process of making these cards better.

1275
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:53,760
They're doing a $200 Amazon gift card giveaway for like the first 10 best stacks or something,

1276
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,760
so you can get in early.

1277
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,760
What a cool community.

1278
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,760
Yeah.

1279
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,000
So get started by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1280
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,020
It comes with your own server, seven plus distros to choose from, modifies the courseware

1281
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:07,160
and the server, spins it up on demand, enhanced learning plans, detailed, comprehensive notes

1282
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:11,320
you can download and keep with you, and like I mentioned, instructor mentoring for topics

1283
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,520
that most other online learning sites would completely gloss over.

1284
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,240
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1285
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,560
Now I know we have talked a lot about universal software installation, and I hope the audience

1286
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,440
is not worn out.

1287
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,960
The sense I get is you all are sort of – the majority of you think, I've heard this one

1288
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:30,960
before.

1289
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,440
I don't have any sense that this is going to go anywhere.

1290
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,440
Why are we talking about this?

1291
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:37,600
That's kind of the general sense I've gotten back from the audience.

1292
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:41,720
However, I have felt for a while now that there is really some serious momentum here,

1293
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,280
more so than we've seen in the past.

1294
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,720
XDG app, now known as Flatpaks, and of course, AppImage, and we've been talking a lot

1295
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,700
about Snap packages on Ubuntu.

1296
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:50,700
In the abstract.

1297
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:56,480
Now today, today, some pretty big news came out.

1298
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:01,620
I kind of smelt it coming, and you might have as well, Snap packages are launching on multiple

1299
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:02,620
Linux distributions.

1300
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:08,140
Essentially, the Snap is going to be available for pretty much all major distros.

1301
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:12,000
Launching with some great partners right out of the gate, including Docker and Telegram

1302
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,680
packages, and I think Corita is in there, and LibreOffice is in there, and they have

1303
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:24,880
packages available for CentOS, and Elementary, and Gentoo, and Mint, and OpenSUSE, and Red

1304
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,560
Hat Enterprise Linux, and Arch Linux, and all of those distros can now install Snap

1305
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,560
packages.

1306
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,480
It's Snappy time, everybody.

1307
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:40,200
Snap packages are here for everybody, and I look at this and I go, brilliant move by

1308
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,200
canonical.

1309
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:46,880
Mark Shuttleworth said, one thing is definitively clear about today's announcement, I'm paraphrasing.

1310
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,760
This is not about Ubuntu.

1311
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,520
This is about all the other Linux distros.

1312
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:56,360
Now I thought that was an interesting thing for Mark to sort of stress, that this is like

1313
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:02,280
the antithesis of being about Ubuntu is what he said.

1314
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:07,360
He also pointed out the Flatpak, the new GNOME XEG app initiative, is 95% of the contributors

1315
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,680
came from one Red Hat employee.

1316
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:09,680
I love it when he does that.

1317
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,680
I love that.

1318
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,600
He said he'd be delighted if they'd work with us.

1319
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,600
God, that's so great.

1320
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,600
It's so good.

1321
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:21,920
Yeah, so the Document Foundation's got LibreOffice.

1322
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:30,080
Dell Mozilla is partnering up with them, Samsung, and Arch and Fedora can run and install Snap

1323
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,080
packages.

1324
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,840
I installed it right before the show.

1325
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,400
You have installed an elementary OS.

1326
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,400
I do.

1327
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,160
I'm not sure it's 100% working, but it's installed anyway.

1328
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,560
Did you get the telegram pass?

1329
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,240
You know, it's giving me an error when I try to launch it, but the rest is working.

1330
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,240
I got SnapD going.

1331
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,240
I can do SnapList.

1332
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,240
I can do SnapInstall.

1333
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,240
Interesting.

1334
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,240
It's probably user error.

1335
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:52,640
So, Rotten, let's start with you, and then I'm going to bounce around some questions.

1336
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,000
You've gotten your hands on it during the show.

1337
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,400
What are your initial impressions?

1338
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:01,520
Yeah, so I started using it earlier in the show, and Snap is great.

1339
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,720
And two things are really shocking.

1340
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,280
NextCloud came out.

1341
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,760
They announced a new version today.

1342
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,560
There is now a Snap for it today.

1343
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:16,400
And I just installed Krita, which by default, when you use apt, it installs like 500 megs

1344
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,040
of dependencies.

1345
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,480
The Snap was only 98 megs.

1346
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,480
Wow.

1347
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,480
Okay.

1348
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,480
All right.

1349
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:30,240
I don't know how that happened, but that sounds very promising.

1350
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:34,920
I wanted to ask Wimpy, because I know he's had some experience recently with Snap packages.

1351
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:39,880
Wimpy, do you think it's now just come down to a race of who can get the most packages

1352
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,520
by the biggest names?

1353
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:47,920
Because you've got Flatpak, AppImage, Orbit, Orbital, whatever it is, and now Snaps.

1354
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:52,080
And it seems like whichever one, since they all work across all the distributions, whichever

1355
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:56,160
one ends up being the sort of go-to to have the most and best software is going to be

1356
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,160
the winner.

1357
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,160
Don't you think?

1358
01:02:58,160 --> 01:02:59,160
Maybe.

1359
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,160
Yeah.

1360
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:06,320
Definitely, there's some first mover advantage there, and there's been a lot of people coalescing

1361
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:10,800
around Snaps and Snappy.

1362
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:15,960
Like QNAP recently announced that their line of NAS devices are going to be moving to Ubuntu

1363
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:16,960
and Snaps.

1364
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,960
Yeah.

1365
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:18,960
That's pretty cool.

1366
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,640
And they're going to be packaging all of their ancillary services and IoT bits and bobs as

1367
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:27,560
Snaps rather than shipping them in the traditional way.

1368
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:31,920
So I think Snaps might be edging out at the moment, but time will tell.

1369
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:32,920
Yeah.

1370
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:39,880
It seems also the KDE project is experimenting with packaging Neon as a Snap, which is really...

1371
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:40,880
That's interesting.

1372
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:41,880
Yeah.

1373
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,200
And the other thing that Ubuntu have done is they've reached out to people in the other

1374
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:54,000
distributions to get Snap working on the other distros, and I'm not sure if that's happened

1375
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,280
the other way.

1376
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:02,720
So the fact that Snap works in all these different places is because Ubuntu developers and community

1377
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:08,800
members have made the effort to try and make that happen, to make it the cross distribution.

1378
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,480
So they're reaching out to those distros and saying, hey, would you like to work with us

1379
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,480
on this?

1380
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:14,480
Yeah.

1381
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,160
So that's a huge component of it, too, getting more and more adoption.

1382
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:23,720
And not just cross distribution, but also across the flavors within Ubuntu and inviting

1383
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:27,240
people and there's been a real effort the last two weeks.

1384
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:32,600
It's a shame I've been on holiday for most of it, but yeah, there's been a real effort

1385
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:38,920
to involve people and bring them up to speed and share knowledge and tips and tricks and

1386
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:41,600
push the platform forwards and learn from one another.

1387
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:46,320
Now, what about the concern that the back end isn't open source to Snap packages?

1388
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,800
Poppy, is that a thing?

1389
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,100
Is that a thing people are complaining about yet?

1390
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:53,160
Is that a misunderstanding?

1391
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,160
Which back end?

1392
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,880
So Snap D is open source.

1393
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:56,880
So Snap-

1394
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,880
Help me understand.

1395
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:58,880
The registry, right?

1396
01:04:58,880 --> 01:04:59,880
Yeah, like this.

1397
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:03,600
Is there like a central registry I can search for Snap packages and that's locked up?

1398
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:08,760
There is a store and we run the store and I don't know what the license on that is.

1399
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:09,760
It currently isn't free software.

1400
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,240
I don't know what will happen with that.

1401
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:16,680
But who runs the store doesn't impact who can download a Snap and just install it on

1402
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,600
their system, right?

1403
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:21,000
The two things are not dependent?

1404
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,020
You can certainly sideload Snaps.

1405
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,320
You can grab a Snap from anywhere.

1406
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:30,280
So for example, initially the Krita developers put a Snap as a downloadable file on their

1407
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,280
website.

1408
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,280
Or like I-

1409
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:33,280
Just like a dev, right?

1410
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,640
I just downloaded the Telegram Snap to my desktop.

1411
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,640
Right.

1412
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,320
So you can certainly do that.

1413
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,640
And yeah, currently the store is non-free.

1414
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,640
I don't know what the plan is for that.

1415
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,680
And I don't know what the plan is for supporting multiple different stores either.

1416
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:54,440
I know that discussions have been happening there because some people will want to have

1417
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,480
all the devices within their own estate only talking to other devices within their own

1418
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,480
estate.

1419
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,480
Sure, right.

1420
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,080
And they don't want them to reach out of their network and go to some third party store

1421
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:09,280
and allow their users to install random Snaps that could contain games or stuff they just

1422
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,280
don't want.

1423
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:13,560
And so I know those discussions have happened, but it's early days and I don't know where

1424
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,560
that is at the moment.

1425
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:21,440
And then we have SnapD, which is an open source piece of software that seems to be the thing

1426
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,760
that has to be specifically packaged for each distribution to make all of this work, to

1427
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,580
make the cross distribution component work.

1428
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:32,840
So there is an Arch package, there is a Fedora package, there is an OpenSUSE package of SnapD,

1429
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:36,320
and that is the sort of bits and-

1430
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,320
The shim layer.

1431
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:38,320
Yeah.

1432
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,320
You needed to install Snaps.

1433
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,360
Am I tracking that right, Poppy?

1434
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,360
Yeah.

1435
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,640
There's multiple parts to it.

1436
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:47,320
The SnapD part is, yeah, the bit that needed to be ported.

1437
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,600
And that's the bit that we already have pre-installed on Ubuntu.

1438
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,440
So we're halfway there.

1439
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,440
And that's GoDemon, right?

1440
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:57,080
Yeah, it's written in Go.

1441
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:02,520
And the Snaps themselves get installed and removed by SnapD.

1442
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:06,840
And there's a front end to SnapD, which is just called Snap.

1443
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:13,060
So you can do commands like snap list to list all the Snaps that you have installed.

1444
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:17,280
And that would be the same as you using apt or dpkg to see what you have installed.

1445
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,800
And then you would do something like snap find, which is where you go out to find out

1446
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,920
what packages are available in the store or in the archive or whatever you want to call

1447
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:26,920
it.

1448
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,400
And, you know, that's the equivalent of apt search or whatever.

1449
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,040
I feel like people are going to misinterpret that as, oh, well, Snaps are trying to replace

1450
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,520
my distribution's package manager.

1451
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,640
Could you already see, oh, look at Canonical.

1452
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,800
They think they're coming out with a package manager for all distros.

1453
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,800
It's not really.

1454
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,800
Go ahead.

1455
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:47,320
Yeah, I don't know.

1456
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:52,260
What I think would be preferable is if you see it from the point of view that your distribution

1457
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:59,960
is giving your users the platform, your platform, which is the value that you provide in that,

1458
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:00,960
whichever that is.

1459
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:01,960
Sure.

1460
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:07,800
There's package freshness in Fedora, that's clean upstream gnome.

1461
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:13,600
And in Gentoo, it's, you know, build it the way you want it.

1462
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:18,100
You know, however, whatever, whatever your platform is, what we're providing is the ability

1463
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:26,880
for the users to get absolutely the freshest things from upstream in a secure manner.

1464
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:28,760
Yeah, I actually am.

1465
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:32,720
I don't know what universal package format is going to win out.

1466
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:33,720
But this, to me –

1467
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,040
We can even just get one.

1468
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,040
Oh, that would be –

1469
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:40,880
I'm really, really – I would love to have one that has a company behind it that has

1470
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,480
a reputation in the open source community.

1471
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:44,480
That seems like a pretty important –

1472
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:48,160
Yeah, Linux has a history of like resolving these things and only having one of everything.

1473
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:49,160
That's right, isn't it?

1474
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,160
We only have one of everything.

1475
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,160
Very good at that.

1476
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:52,160
Yeah, yeah.

1477
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:55,760
Yeah, but we do have – but I could see a dominant one.

1478
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,000
I could see a dominant one emerging.

1479
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,400
And the – boy, excuse me.

1480
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,160
The launch across multiple distros on day one –

1481
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:05,160
Huge.

1482
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:06,160
Smooth.

1483
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,160
Real smooth.

1484
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:11,280
The fact that I could just – it was just in the AUR immediately and I could just go

1485
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,560
grab it and install the Telegram snap.

1486
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:19,320
I was kind of surprised that didn't leak out, that people didn't spot things appearing

1487
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:22,840
in various archives and people say, hello, look at this.

1488
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:23,840
What's this doing here?

1489
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,840
I had heard some rumbling.

1490
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:25,840
I had heard some rumbling.

1491
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:26,840
But –

1492
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,840
Okay, so maybe people didn't –

1493
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,600
Me and my little Ubuntu bubble, I didn't spot that.

1494
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:35,480
I thought – I just – I don't actually know if this is going to be it, but I – even

1495
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:39,400
if it's a well-supported one, the momentum you've already seen behind snap packages

1496
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:40,400
is really good.

1497
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,400
Oh, you like?

1498
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,400
What do you got there?

1499
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,400
What do you got there?

1500
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,400
Look at that.

1501
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,400
Are you pasting from the web?

1502
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:46,400
Yes, I am.

1503
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,400
Okay, so read that error message on your screen.

1504
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,800
So I'm pasting into the terminal from the web.

1505
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,280
Copying commands into the terminal can be dangerous.

1506
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:56,840
Be sure you understand what each part of this command does and then in big red button, paste

1507
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,600
it anyway, which I am about to hit.

1508
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:02,000
Look at Loki warning you about the dangers of pasting commands from the web, which is

1509
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,840
ironic because a couple of – like LibreOffice was the one.

1510
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:11,480
Ham Radio was telling me he was downloading LibreOffice using a snap package and the post

1511
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:14,800
just tells you to use wget and has the app get install command and all this stuff.

1512
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,200
Just copy and paste this into your terminal and you'll be good to go.

1513
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,200
You'll be fine.

1514
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,640
Yeah, that's not a good idea.

1515
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,880
The warning about using – copying and pasting things in the terminal was actually in the

1516
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:25,880
last version too.

1517
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:26,880
I'm not sure about that.

1518
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:27,880
I think – yeah.

1519
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,680
It's still nice to see.

1520
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,960
I think this is a pretty huge development, getting snap packages for all distros.

1521
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,680
I don't know where it's going to go for sure but to me, I have always struggled with

1522
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:39,040
– this is really a first world podcaster problem.

1523
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:46,240
But when I talk about an app or we do a desktop app pick on the Linux Action Show, I experiment

1524
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,480
with, well, what do I do here?

1525
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,240
Do I link to the open source of build service?

1526
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,240
Do I link to the AUR?

1527
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,360
Do I link to a deb and an RPM?

1528
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:56,580
And I have experimented with doing all of them and it just feels ridiculous.

1529
01:10:56,580 --> 01:11:03,080
And so what I have defaulted to doing is I generally link to maybe the Ubuntu version

1530
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:08,120
somewhere and the version I installed from the AUR or something like that because that's

1531
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:11,520
the one I did so you can reproduce what I've done.

1532
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:16,960
And the ability now to say just go here and download this snap and whatever distro you've

1533
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:22,200
chosen is going to work for you now, like Telegram and Herupad and Mumble, is going

1534
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,200
to be a huge shift.

1535
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:31,520
And if this all goes well enough where it's adopted by a majority of application publishers,

1536
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:36,080
there could become a point in time where we simply just remember a time before snap packages

1537
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,680
and then there's life after snap packages.

1538
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:38,760
Matthew Feeney Exactly.

1539
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:42,840
I will say as well like I'm just – I've been using LexD a lot which is also another

1540
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,480
Go daemon written by Ubuntu and I've been quite pleased with it.

1541
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:51,840
So I think if Snappy is of similar quality, I could be OK with this as being the universal

1542
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,840
package.

1543
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:53,840
Trevor Burrus Look at them using Go.

1544
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:54,840
Hopi, do you have any – do you know anything about this?

1545
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:58,800
Is Go sort of like canonicals, not to be punny, but go-to language?

1546
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,720
Hopi Kile Yeah, it's funny.

1547
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:05,000
I remember when I very first started at the company.

1548
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:09,960
So three and a bit years ago, I remember Mark evangelizing about – Mark Shalworth evangelizing

1549
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,200
about Go and saying it was the next big thing.

1550
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:18,760
And like this is obviously pre some of the other new things that have come out from Google

1551
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:21,800
and Apple and Microsoft and so on.

1552
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:28,720
But it – he was evangelizing it for a while some time ago and now a lot of the developers

1553
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:33,820
have picked up on that and said actually it is quite a nice language to develop in.

1554
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:37,260
And so a lot of the tools like – but even if someone's just hacking together a little

1555
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:42,000
command line tool, they'll do it in Go or a daemon, they'll do it in Go.

1556
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,400
It seems quite popular with developers as well.

1557
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,280
Ryan Lewis Yeah, I get a lot of good feedback about Go

1558
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,780
and Rust and Dakota Radio.

1559
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:53,400
And people seem to feel like Go is really something special and wonder why Google doesn't

1560
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,400
use it more themselves.

1561
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:58,820
Rod and I guess I'll give you a chance to chime in here as somebody who's packaging

1562
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:01,200
up applications for different distributions.

1563
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,760
This has got to be potentially offering a big relief.

1564
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:08,280
Now how much do you expect users to actually go out and enable snap support on their distro

1565
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,280
of choice though?

1566
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:13,840
Ryan Lewis Well, hopefully it'll become – in a while

1567
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:18,440
from now I expect, but hopefully it will become a normal thing.

1568
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:26,880
Even if Ubuntu, the base of Ubuntu and all the flavors were just snaps and everybody

1569
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,520
else use flat packs or App Images or whatever, I don't care.

1570
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:36,720
That's at least tenfold better than what I currently have to do.

1571
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:43,880
So for my – every time I make a new release, I have to – I've made 19 packages for

1572
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:44,880
everything.

1573
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:51,880
So I have – and that's not even the maintenance where I have to contact the maintainers of

1574
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,920
each distro for packages we don't make.

1575
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,500
So I have to deal with those two and then I have to make sure that the package builds

1576
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:01,880
and the e-builds are all up to date and things like that, which they're not always.

1577
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:07,320
And then – and that doesn't even take into account that I have to make new versions.

1578
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:11,240
I have to make different packages for each version of a distro.

1579
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:14,120
So like Fedora 22, Fedora 23.

1580
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:18,840
So every time I make a new release of our app, we also have to make a new package for

1581
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:22,960
that distro and every version of that distro that's still currently supported.

1582
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,480
So for like Ubuntu, we have like four.

1583
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:31,760
So we have so many packages we have to make and just – and if we have three new universal

1584
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:38,280
things that take over, I would be so ecstatic for that, just to have three rather than 20

1585
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:39,280
or whatever.

1586
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,280
Wow.

1587
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:41,280
That's funny.

1588
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:45,240
On the subject of packaging, we've done a couple of events last Tuesday and this – or

1589
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:46,600
a couple of days ago on this Tuesday.

1590
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:53,160
We did a thing called the Snappy Playpen and the idea was that we would create a GitHub

1591
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:56,360
repo in which we just dump the configuration file.

1592
01:14:56,360 --> 01:15:01,800
So to make a snappy package, there's a YAML file, a plain text YAML file that describes

1593
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:02,800
the build of the application.

1594
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:03,800
It's pretty straightforward.

1595
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:07,680
Anyone can read it and it's not hard to break up.

1596
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:12,640
But we – you know, Snap is quite new and we've been finding all the various edges

1597
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,600
and pointy sharp places that we mustn't touch and it's a learning exercise for us

1598
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:23,500
as well as people like Rotten who is developing his apps and wants to package them up.

1599
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:28,280
So we've been doing this and packaging a random bunch of applications, some of them

1600
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:35,000
less random kind of well-chosen applications in order to find those pointy sharp places

1601
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,920
so that we can educate other people on how to package stuff up.

1602
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:42,560
So when they say, okay, I've got my GNOME app or I've got my KDE app or I've got

1603
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:47,720
my C++ OpenGL app, how do I package it up as a Snap?

1604
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:52,520
And we could just point them at this GitHub repo and in there are examples.

1605
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:57,080
So we're not necessarily uploading all of these to the store, they're upstream programs

1606
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:02,900
like for example, I packaged up MindTest, the free software Minecraft clone.

1607
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:10,880
So if you want to see how to package up an OpenGL C++ application and it packages it

1608
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:16,520
from the tip of Git, so you could run this command SnapCraft in order to build yourself

1609
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:20,600
a Snap package which is bleeding edge nightly build.

1610
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:26,000
So you could run a cron job potentially, a cron job which built you a Snap package overnight

1611
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:31,320
every night and uploaded it to a nightly version to the store so every day your users get the

1612
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,880
freshest version.

1613
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:39,160
I rotten, you had a response to that and there's a bit of a but in it I think.

1614
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:40,940
No, not really.

1615
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:45,640
It's more of a hopefulness.

1616
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:51,360
So the point that Peppermint was making about how the upstream is controlling it, that is

1617
01:16:51,360 --> 01:17:00,920
something I've been begging for at least 10 years now even though there was never even

1618
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:08,120
on the radar but I've been hoping for something like that for years and when I contact a maintain

1619
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:13,060
of an app to get my app updated in the repos, it could take anywhere from a couple days

1620
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:16,960
to a year and a half before I get a reply.

1621
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:22,800
It's a horrible process that I understand why people have a problem with packaging for

1622
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:28,780
Linux really but with the fact that Snappy allows for the upstream maintainers and developers

1623
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:33,880
to control when stuff gets updated and pushed to the users, that is something I've been

1624
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:39,080
waiting for and I am so excited I'm like beside myself.

1625
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:42,740
So what you just touched on is exactly, I've talked about it before but we've been recently

1626
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:48,600
talking about Nextcloud and Frank and Frank and I had an off the record conversation that

1627
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,120
was sort of on the record in the sense that he knows I've been telling this story for

1628
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:54,760
years now.

1629
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:59,540
He had a very sort of unfortunate fight with Debian for a while because they were shipping

1630
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:04,800
such old versions of own cloud repo that users were installing version 7 when version 8 would

1631
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,280
be out or something like that or version 5 when version 8 would be out was actually the

1632
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:09,280
case.

1633
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,280
It was really bad.

1634
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:15,800
They were riddled with security, no longer getting updates and he said really our pace

1635
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:20,160
of development, the features that we are adding to stay competitive, the methodology in which

1636
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:24,360
we publish it, all of it, it's just – it's more appropriate if it comes directly from

1637
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:25,360
us.

1638
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:26,360
It just works better for the end user.

1639
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,360
It's more secure.

1640
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:33,840
We can support it plus we don't end up having to answer support questions for five versions

1641
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:34,840
of software.

1642
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:37,560
So from a developer standpoint, I think people are really encouraged.

1643
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:41,160
Just like that screensaver mess that's going on in Debian right now.

1644
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:42,160
Yes, exactly.

1645
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:45,320
And, you know, I think here's what it would really take.

1646
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:50,160
I think Snap packages, if they could benefit from the Docker effect, I think it would be

1647
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,160
like wildfire.

1648
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,160
Yeah.

1649
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:56,100
What really did – what really for Docker, what you were able to do, you could be just

1650
01:18:56,100 --> 01:18:58,000
the laziest Linux user ever.

1651
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,720
You could be like one of those – not to insult you guys, but one of those web developers

1652
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:08,080
that uses a Mac and then SSHs into his Ubuntu server and Docker came along and all of a

1653
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,720
sudden you didn't have to deal with actually installing Linux software.

1654
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:13,160
You could just pull down a Docker image and boom, you had it in time.

1655
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:14,640
Someone already provisions it for you.

1656
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:15,640
Yeah.

1657
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,320
Oh, you want a Minecraft server.

1658
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,320
You want a Mamo server.

1659
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,320
You want an own cloud server.

1660
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,320
You want a Zimbra server.

1661
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,320
Yeah, just pull down this Docker image.

1662
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,320
It's good to go.

1663
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:27,480
If Ubuntu – if Canonical can get enough adoption around Snap packages where I can

1664
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:32,960
install what we as Linux users used to consider extremely complicated installations, things

1665
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,520
like entire desktop environments.

1666
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:40,920
If I can reduce installing an entire desktop environment down to one or two Snap packages,

1667
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:45,440
if I want to try out the latest Plasma desktop, I can download a single or maybe four or whatever

1668
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,600
it is Snap packages and I have that entire thing and I haven't mucked up all the depths

1669
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:50,600
on my system.

1670
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,960
I was about to say, the other nice part is like when you want to remove it, done, gone.

1671
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:54,960
Your system is going to be –

1672
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,440
Another example, Ardour.

1673
01:19:56,440 --> 01:20:00,000
Ardour is universally known as one of the harder applications to install and get everything

1674
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
working.

1675
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,760
If I can pull down a single Snap package, double click that and have a working installation

1676
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:07,640
of Ardour and you multiply this across all of the little edge cases in Linux where it's

1677
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:12,040
hard to get this particular thing set up or it involves trashing your entire system with

1678
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:17,240
libraries from something and you start solving that problem and get enough projects behind

1679
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:24,960
it that people want, I think the idea of having to install SnapD first is – well, that's

1680
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,680
a no-brainer because that's even easier than getting Docker set up.

1681
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:30,440
So there is a bit of a Docker effect that could happen.

1682
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,440
Go ahead.

1683
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,280
I think I agree with you.

1684
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:38,120
What you're suggesting really is there needs to be the killer app.

1685
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:42,640
So I've been looking at – as part of this Snappy Playpen thing is looking at what are

1686
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:49,800
apps that people really want and that are often updated with very high velocity, a fast

1687
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:56,680
cadence like Nextcloud, that people want the bleeding edge version but other people might

1688
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:57,680
want a stable version.

1689
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:03,640
So you could have two snaps, a nightly and a stable and one of the ones I looked at today

1690
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:10,720
was Ardour actually and so I started building a Snap for Ardour today and Audacity as well

1691
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:15,340
and I came across a couple of bugs which are being filed and those will be fixed but yeah,

1692
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:19,680
those are exactly the kind of apps and the cadence lives and the things that move quickly

1693
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,040
where you want the latest thing.

1694
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:26,600
I packaged up a Snap for FFmpeg because everyone wants the latest codecs and all that kind

1695
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,600
of stuff.

1696
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:28,600
Oh, from everyone.

1697
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:29,600
Thank you.

1698
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,600
So yeah, and MPV as well.

1699
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:31,600
I did MPV today.

1700
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,600
MPV was super easy.

1701
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,120
That was like not hard at all.

1702
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,040
So yeah, it's good fun.

1703
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:42,300
And so now when you install the MPV Snap, will it automatically – how does it get updated?

1704
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,680
So this is the thing.

1705
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:50,880
When I was creating the Snapcraft configuration, the idea is that I would then give this to

1706
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:54,360
the upstream developer and say, here you go, here's the configuration, here's how you

1707
01:21:54,360 --> 01:22:00,200
make a snap because rather than burden them with yet another packaging format, I just

1708
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:04,880
tell them this is the configuration file, you run this command on a Ubuntu system and

1709
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:09,840
you'll get a snap out of it or if you want to, you can push your code or mirror your

1710
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:15,300
code to Launchpad and Launchpad will build you a snap for you much the same way as it

1711
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:19,640
builds devs in a PPA and then you can just push that to the store as and when you're

1712
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:20,640
ready.

1713
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,640
And if you want, you can have two channels.

1714
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:25,160
You can have a channel for beta tester users and a channel for stable users.

1715
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:29,920
So some of your people might be wanting the bleeding edge version and you can canary out

1716
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:33,560
to them and then they can play with it and then you can push it out to your stable users.

1717
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:35,100
See, that's pretty nice.

1718
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,400
So you would get updates when the developer uploads them.

1719
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,720
I don't intend to upload MPV or mind test to the store.

1720
01:22:41,720 --> 01:22:47,680
I intend to put a contribution to upstream and say, here's how you package it.

1721
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,360
You upload it to the store because then they control it.

1722
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:50,360
They can see the stats.

1723
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:51,360
They can see all that.

1724
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,320
And they maintain it.

1725
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,320
That is really cool.

1726
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:57,240
And so you're doing a few proof of concepts there and saying, hey, if you want to know

1727
01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:59,120
how I did it, here's all the here's all information.

1728
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:00,840
Yeah, we're putting it all on GitHub.

1729
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:06,080
If you just go to GitHub and search for snappy playpen, you'll find them all.

1730
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,080
That I don't know.

1731
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:10,240
I feel like there's going to be a bunch of naysayers that will say this competes with

1732
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:13,800
OBS in this way and this competes with that in this way and this is not invented here

1733
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:14,800
syndrome.

1734
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:19,320
But I part of me, I actually think canonical would have had a good degree of success if

1735
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:23,120
this would have been Ubuntu only and if this technology never would have left the Ubuntu

1736
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,120
platform.

1737
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:29,640
And the fact that not invented here one is quite funny, though, Chris, just as a little

1738
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,640
like nugget of information.

1739
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:37,080
If you look at the very first commit done to snappy, it was done on the 12th of the

1740
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:40,280
12th, 2014.

1741
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:45,080
If you look at the very first commit done to XDG app, it was done five days later on

1742
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:49,160
the 17th of the 12th, 2014.

1743
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,160
So they're very close.

1744
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:52,000
I don't know who could call that.

1745
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
It's very close.

1746
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:58,000
And I think, you know, I think part of it is I think we have to sort of change the mindset

1747
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
a bit.

1748
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:02,680
What we have to do is I think it's reasonable to expect Canonical to spend their time and

1749
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:05,560
resources developing something that's ideal for their platform.

1750
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:13,120
I think it's actually sort of surprising that you guys went to the effort to actually package

1751
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:16,600
it up and push it out further because you really never had to do that.

1752
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:17,600
That never really had to happen.

1753
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,600
It could have been …

1754
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,600
How dare we be good citizens in the Linux environment?

1755
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:26,600
It could have been a nice competitive edge, I suppose.

1756
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:29,120
You guys are a big enough ecosystem that you could have made it work.

1757
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:32,480
I just think it's – even though it's another option, I think it looks like a pretty

1758
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,400
good one and I think it has – there's a lot of positives to it.

1759
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:38,920
I'm not saying I necessarily know if it's going to be the winner but I like the start.

1760
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:43,480
The start seems pretty strong and the partners already on board seem pretty good and the

1761
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:47,040
potential for it just being useful within the Ubuntu ecosystem seems strong.

1762
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,360
So overall it seems kind of like a winner just depending on how much adoption it gets

1763
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:51,360
from here.

1764
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:53,920
I guess we'll just wait and see like so many other things.

1765
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:58,480
But I know what I think probably pretty much going forward, I will be installing Snap D

1766
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,200
on my Arch systems.

1767
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,440
Why not?

1768
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:05,680
I think that's kind of a big thing.

1769
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:08,200
I haven't – I guess I did get Flatpak working too.

1770
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,920
I do have Flatpak support too but – and I have done an app.

1771
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:15,880
I wonder when we'll start seeing like meta wrappers around these things or like an AUR

1772
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:17,480
built-in kind of support thing.

1773
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:21,880
I feel like someone at home or in the car right now is like pulling out their hair though

1774
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:26,000
and wants to argue with us because we haven't heard a lot of opposition in the virtual lug

1775
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
today.

1776
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,520
So that either means that people sort of universally think it's probably kind of a good thing

1777
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:36,280
or that person who doesn't agree hasn't been properly represented.

1778
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:38,080
If that's you, you should join us next week.

1779
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:39,080
Join our virtual lug.

1780
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,080
That's right.

1781
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:43,600
Because we'd love to hear from you or you can leave us a comment at linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1782
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,600
We love those too.

1783
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,480
You'll find episode 149 listed there.

1784
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:50,240
Links to the stuff we talked about like Snap packages and all the other things will be

1785
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,240
in the show notes.

1786
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:52,240
You'll find episode 149.

1787
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:57,160
We do the Unplugged program on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv and go to jupiterbroadcasting.com

1788
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:00,280
slash calendar to find out when we're live.

1789
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:04,400
Probably can look forward to some NOAA stopping by in the future too when I go out around

1790
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,400
the first week of July.

1791
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,400
That's always an adventure.

1792
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:07,400
Yeah.

1793
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:08,400
Yeah.

1794
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,400
All right everybody.

1795
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:10,400
Thanks for joining us.

1796
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:13,680
Remember you can follow live announcements also at Jupiter Signal.

1797
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:14,680
That's always handy as well.

1798
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:38,360
See you next Tuesday.

1799
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:50,000
You know I was just thinking about it.

1800
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,520
Really the benchmark where I'd be happy for Snap packages to get to would be if when I

1801
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:59,880
get new people to switch over to Linux I can just say download this file and install this

1802
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:00,880
program.

1803
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:01,880
Yeah.

1804
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:02,880
And it doesn't matter which distro they've chosen.

1805
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,600
I know there's a high probability that most of the apps are going to want the Snap package.

1806
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,300
That's really the only that's the bar.

1807
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:09,320
That's really the bar for me.

1808
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:14,280
Do Snap packages work on GNU slash K windows?

1809
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:15,280
I mean it does.

1810
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,280
Actually.

1811
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:17,280
I wonder.

1812
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,280
Yes they will.

1813
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,280
They have to.

1814
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,280
Yeah.

1815
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:21,280
I mean why not right?

1816
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:22,280
They would have to.

1817
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:25,840
Because the subsystem is 14.04 but when they update to 16.04 it theoretically would.

1818
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:26,840
Awesome.

1819
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,840
Are they going to update to 16.04?

1820
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:29,840
And how does that work?

1821
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,840
Just talk about it.

1822
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:31,840
Yeah.

1823
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,840
Does that come down as a Windows?

1824
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:36,840
I guess it would be like a Microsoft store update for your new Ubuntu 16.04.

1825
01:27:36,840 --> 01:27:39,080
Oh it's gross.

1826
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:40,080
My brain hurts.

1827
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,080
It's gross.

1828
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,080
All right.

1829
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,080
JBtitles.com.

1830
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,080
JBtitles.com.

1831
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:49,600
It's funny because people are going to talk about it how like the flat packs are people

1832
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:54,720
are already saying that Snappy wasn't good because it wasn't cross distro and stuff.

1833
01:27:54,720 --> 01:27:59,960
So now that that's done people can pick up other things to complain about.

1834
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:03,640
But I think it's fantastic and I don't care which one is taking over.

1835
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:05,680
I just want something to take over.

1836
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:11,420
And a fundamental problem with the Linux ecosystem is the package distribution.

1837
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:17,840
As someone who's maintained and developed on basically every angle because I work in

1838
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:23,760
distros and I also make software, it is one of the most frustrating things of being a

1839
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:24,840
Linux user.

1840
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:30,600
I understand when a company says that's too much work because for the most part they're

1841
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:37,520
right and Snappy and flat pack and whatever provides a solution to that fundamental problem

1842
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:45,800
we've had for so long that I am – I could not be more excited for the horrible experience

1843
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,840
of package distribution to be over.

1844
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:48,840
Yeah.

1845
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:54,960
I think it's – I think it serves – it still remains a well tool – how is the right

1846
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:55,960
way to say this?

1847
01:28:55,960 --> 01:29:00,600
It's the right tool for maintaining the distribution and the core distribution packages.

1848
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:05,800
It seems like it's probably not the right tool for a lot of applications we distribute

1849
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:06,800
over the web now.

1850
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:07,800
Right.

1851
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:08,800
Yeah.

1852
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:17,520
Chris, I think you've said before repos and downloadable distros 15 years ago, Linux

1853
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:21,160
and Linux distros were way ahead of the curve compared to commercial OSes.

1854
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:22,160
Totally.

1855
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:27,720
We had a little bit of an advancement when PPAs became a thing but it's been stagnant

1856
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:34,920
for a while and Apple with the iTunes store, Microsoft is trying to replicate things with

1857
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:35,920
the Windows store.

1858
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:36,920
Right.

1859
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:37,920
They caught on.

1860
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,120
They realized, oh, hey, we need a store.

1861
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:43,640
We need a central distribution system.

1862
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:51,720
So I guess here's where I'm going to dissent is how do we keep the benefits of a centralized

1863
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:58,840
download repository and the security and the assurances that gives users while also easing

1864
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:02,360
the difficulties for distribution and for package maintainers.

1865
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:07,120
I think the way this happens is you have to have two components.

1866
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:12,080
You have to have the front-end component and I think you already have canonicals fork or

1867
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:16,920
whatever you want to call it of GNOME software that is going to work with snap packages,

1868
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:17,920
does work with snap packages.

1869
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:18,920
It already does.

1870
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:19,920
Yeah.

1871
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,520
There's no reason that couldn't be reincorporated back into mainline GNOME software I would

1872
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,520
assume.

1873
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,640
So there's your front-end.

1874
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:28,400
Then I would imagine if this thing really took off and people were really shipping software

1875
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:34,140
and businesses who depend on it to maybe earn a revenue are shipping software, I bet the

1876
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:39,720
pressure on canonical to open source any remaining behind-the-scenes bits would be – they would

1877
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:40,720
probably just do it.

1878
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:44,200
I mean they would probably do that as part of, well, this thing has grown beyond our

1879
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:45,200
initial vision.

1880
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,620
It's now sort of become part of the ecosystem.

1881
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:48,620
So here's the last remaining bits.

1882
01:30:48,620 --> 01:30:51,160
And even if not, that will just get re-implemented if it's big enough.

1883
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:52,160
Exactly.

1884
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,160
Exactly.

1885
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:57,360
So my concerns would definitely be satiated if each of the districts, if they rely on

1886
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:05,320
GNOME software, being able to read and understand flat packs and snaps so that – again, I

1887
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:10,760
guess the biggest thing that I don't want to see come from this is that, oh, I heard

1888
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:18,000
about this great new app, whether it's Telegram or New App X, and I just go to a random website

1889
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:25,680
and download it as a noob because even if it is secured, even if it is sandboxed, is

1890
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,640
it still trustworthy?

1891
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:28,640
Yeah.

1892
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,000
How do you avoid that though?

1893
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,160
Because I see that every time I switch somebody over to Linux, that's the first thing they

1894
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:35,400
do is they go Google it and go try to download it from the website.

1895
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:36,400
Right.

1896
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:37,400
It's just built in.

1897
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,800
They never even think about the App Store or a repo.

1898
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:40,800
It's just not even –

1899
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,440
Some even like Mac users and stuff where they're supposed to use that.

1900
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:47,600
You know, it's like you just – you type it into Google and you hit download and it's

1901
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:48,600
supposed to work.

1902
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:49,600
So how do you avoid that?

1903
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,600
Yeah.

1904
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:55,560
So many Windows users that I see coming over, they're used to – first thing they do

1905
01:31:55,560 --> 01:32:00,840
once they get a new Windows box up, they download night-night installer or night-night installer

1906
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:07,720
to go download 7-Zip and LibreOffice and all of these other random binaries from the internet.

1907
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:11,840
I show them Ubuntu Mate Welcome and I'm like, well, this is 10 times better.

1908
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:12,840
Yeah.

1909
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:13,840
But you see, here's where I feel like.

1910
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:18,560
I feel like Snap packages sort of provide for both because you have GNOME software.

1911
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:22,440
You could easily integrate it into – well, not easily, but there could be future improvements

1912
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:29,440
to Mate Welcome to support Snap packages and also there is that back-end repository that

1913
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:32,760
if you integrate with Launchpad or the back-end index.

1914
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:36,880
So if you could convince a user just to use a front-end piece of software to do all the

1915
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,200
searching, Snap packages provide for that.

1916
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:43,920
But if you can't convince them, Snap packages also provide for at least a semi-streamline

1917
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:49,120
standardized and hopefully secure way to do downloads off the web directly when users

1918
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,120
opt to go that route.

1919
01:32:50,120 --> 01:32:52,260
So it seems like it provides for both.

1920
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:53,760
And I would also agree.

1921
01:32:53,760 --> 01:33:04,480
So my hope is that Snap Packagers and the up-streams do buy into both pieces.

1922
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:10,440
They see the benefits already with the ease of packaging and the improvement that has

1923
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:15,880
over working with distro maintainers, but they also buy into the back-end integration,

1924
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:22,280
whether it's linking to Launchpad or GNOME software or whatever the case may be.

1925
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:26,760
Well I mean there could also be something like the UAP Explorer things.

1926
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:30,880
I mean right now it's kind of messy, but if there was a website that just catalogs

1927
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:36,640
everything that's in the Snap store, and then all you need to do is click a button

1928
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:41,420
that would then activate either GNOME software or just load it up a thing to start installing

1929
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:43,600
from the Snap.

1930
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:44,600
They don't really care.

1931
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:47,720
They're just used to going to on the web and finding it.

1932
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:52,160
So if you say there's a store you could use it, like awesome, great, we'll do that.

1933
01:33:52,160 --> 01:34:01,440
If they just search by out of the normal expectation and they find something like the UAP Explorer

1934
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:05,440
and they just click the install button, they don't care if they're downloading or not.

1935
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:08,720
They would probably prefer it if it would just start installing.

1936
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:17,360
So if you solve both of those issues of their expectation and also embrace the new store

1937
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:21,760
concept, I think that they would have no problem transitioning whatsoever and would probably

1938
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:39,080
like it even better.
