WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
I did have D&D on I just opened up I opened up my phone I actually forgot

00:04.880 --> 00:07.100
why I unlocked my phone this is the other thing that happens to me is I

00:07.100 --> 00:13.340
pulled my phone out and I unlocked it to do something but I saw I had six text

00:13.340 --> 00:17.880
messages about scheduling a car drop off for repair and I'm like and that took

00:17.880 --> 00:21.120
all my brain processing and now I have no idea why I pulled my phone out and

00:21.120 --> 00:25.360
that happens to me derailed several times a day like that's probably that

00:25.360 --> 00:30.440
that's a weird thing it's like that that see this is why this is why I love the

00:30.440 --> 00:33.520
oneplus phones with the switch the hardware switch you just flick the

00:33.520 --> 00:38.280
switch down and you do notice yeah that's it job done I I think Apple's

00:38.280 --> 00:41.360
probably gonna drop that from the iPhone and I think that's the best thing about

00:41.360 --> 00:45.880
the iPhone too is they've always had that physical switch my bad was and this

00:45.880 --> 00:49.640
is what you really got oh you really got a guard against as I saw the unread

00:49.640 --> 00:53.000
badge on messages which there's only a couple of but there's only a couple of

00:53.000 --> 00:56.040
people that actually sent me text messages mm-hmm and I did when I read it

00:56.040 --> 00:59.200
went right into the message thread and I saw the whole thing I'm like oh it's too

00:59.200 --> 01:02.960
late now you're just read yeah now I won't go back and it was no good but I

01:02.960 --> 01:06.880
did have it muted I just I unlocked the phone to do something else you should

01:06.880 --> 01:10.600
hide that somewhere really I know I should like put it off on another

01:10.600 --> 01:14.720
screen somewhere you guys sound like a bunch of old people really yeah cuz we

01:14.720 --> 01:18.480
why we forget stuff easily oh you you're messing things up on your phone you like

01:18.480 --> 01:22.400
the hardware switches I tell you what being able to reach in your pocket and

01:22.400 --> 01:26.160
flip that switch Chris the future is software-defined everything we're gonna

01:26.160 --> 01:30.160
live in a software-defined reality I I'm gonna miss that when they win when phone

01:30.160 --> 01:34.200
manufacturers dropping the headphone port is rough and dropping that mute

01:34.200 --> 01:38.360
toggle mute switch is rough then it can you know worse than I dropped they drop

01:38.360 --> 01:42.960
the flip phone yeah it'll be back it'll be back they just want to build one

01:42.960 --> 01:46.640
small thing that's just metal and glass and nothing else yeah mark my words of

01:46.640 --> 01:50.600
the flip phone will come back maybe maybe it'll be Nokia wouldn't that be

01:50.600 --> 01:59.000
something if it was a Nokia yeah let's do a pre-show take an extra dose to

01:59.000 --> 02:04.080
don't you mean a Microsoft phone Chris no no no so see there's a there's there's

02:04.080 --> 02:08.800
still Nokia and they got I thought I thought Microsoft kept the phone part

02:08.800 --> 02:13.480
and spun off everything else well there's actually still it's very

02:13.480 --> 02:19.880
confusing no the original the original sale had an a time limitation on

02:19.880 --> 02:24.000
Microsoft making smartphones so it always reverted back to Nokia for

02:24.000 --> 02:27.800
making smartphones after a couple of years and they started preparing for

02:27.800 --> 02:33.700
that yeah yeah and they are actually all the patents they are already doing they're

02:33.700 --> 02:36.600
shipping Android phones right now they've started doing it oh yeah

02:36.600 --> 02:41.480
Microsoft owns the patents though that's the important yeah this is Linux

02:41.480 --> 02:57.160
unplugged episode 208 for August 1st 2017

02:57.160 --> 03:01.840
Oh welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show where one of your

03:01.840 --> 03:07.640
hosts is literally witnessing his Bitcoin Empire fork my name is Chris my

03:07.640 --> 03:14.120
name is Wes hello s quite the show today and once again ladies and gentlemen the

03:14.120 --> 03:19.320
beard joins us aka mr. Rekha hello beard hi guys hello Beardsley thank you for

03:19.320 --> 03:23.280
making it again this week what a champ we have quite a show today quite quite

03:23.280 --> 03:26.840
quite a show today we had to because you're in you know you have such woes

03:26.840 --> 03:30.240
about your finances that's true we have the topics of forks coming up in a

03:30.240 --> 03:36.560
little bit some big transitions for the gnome project project windows users have

03:36.560 --> 03:40.280
yet another reason not to switch to Linux we're gonna finally talk about

03:40.280 --> 03:43.600
that beautiful Linux based on plasma that I forgot to get to last week

03:43.600 --> 03:48.160
Corita's got some troubles Firefox has got some new projects and JB's making a

03:48.160 --> 03:54.120
transition plus the start of a new challenge we'll talk up we'll talk about

03:54.120 --> 03:57.360
we'll kick off that's what I'm looking for we'll kick off the slack wear

03:57.360 --> 04:00.400
challenge this week on the show we're gonna kick off the slack wear challenge

04:00.400 --> 04:04.680
are you ready was I'm so excited are you you're gonna do with me right yes I am

04:04.680 --> 04:07.760
so we'll talk about this we'll talk about the slack wear challenge we'll lay

04:07.760 --> 04:11.320
the groundwork in this week's episode so we got all of that plus we have some

04:11.320 --> 04:15.120
breaking news that's happening right now as we record this show so before we go

04:15.120 --> 04:18.620
any further point of order right here got to bring in that mumble room time

04:18.620 --> 04:28.400
appropriate greetings virtual look I love that thank you for being here so

04:28.400 --> 04:33.880
really quickly just off the top we won't make a big to-do about it but a very

04:33.880 --> 04:39.880
valuable and well-known open source project is undergoing a major fork today

04:39.880 --> 04:48.080
and it's Bitcoin Bitcoin is splitting into BCC and BTC so a minority of

04:48.080 --> 04:52.600
Bitcoin but yet influential community members are forking Bitcoin to Bitcoin

04:52.600 --> 04:57.480
cash on August 1st that was today this blip the Bitcoin blockchain split into

04:57.480 --> 05:02.840
two now it doesn't look like it's having really a huge impact on value or on

05:02.840 --> 05:07.880
people's balances the value of Bitcoin has remained pretty steady today it just

05:07.880 --> 05:11.320
essentially creates a new token now it's up to different aspects of the community

05:11.320 --> 05:15.480
if they're going to recognize it or not Bitcoin cash will fork bitcoins existing

05:15.480 --> 05:19.880
software and transaction history and it brings a new cryptocurrency tokens on a

05:19.880 --> 05:25.520
new blockchain with different rules one of those big rules is the size of the

05:25.520 --> 05:29.480
blockchain individual transactions and whatnot this has sort of been brewing in

05:29.480 --> 05:32.400
the background for a while more than a year really probably since I've been

05:32.400 --> 05:38.640
doing plan B and as a Bitcoin user I noticed that there is a massive massive

05:38.640 --> 05:44.200
massive delay now in processing transactions unless you really kind of

05:44.200 --> 05:49.560
grease the wheels with an unusually high transaction fee but after running into a

05:49.560 --> 05:53.680
few roadblocks this morning miners were able to successfully create blocks on a

05:53.680 --> 05:57.720
new blockchain called Bitcoin cash at a rough at roughly I don't know why it's

05:57.720 --> 06:03.280
roughly at 2 14 p.m. Eastern Time today with the this effectively means it's

06:03.280 --> 06:07.840
happened at this point in time some pretty big outlets though are not really

06:07.840 --> 06:13.560
recognizing Bitcoin cash I believe coinbase being one of them yeah yeah and

06:13.560 --> 06:18.240
it's taking off it's growing it's growing from there the the big launch

06:18.240 --> 06:20.560
though I mean this some people may it may actually be able to make some money

06:20.560 --> 06:23.840
for this we may see that both these things continue to exist especially if

06:23.840 --> 06:28.120
transaction fees are lower on the Bitcoin cash network so it may be that

06:28.120 --> 06:32.320
smaller transactions become popular in Bitcoin cash and large transactions

06:32.320 --> 06:37.080
become more popular on standard BTC who knows but I know it's not a Linux topic

06:37.080 --> 06:40.400
but don't tell me tell the Linux Foundation the power of forking I think

06:40.400 --> 06:44.200
it's just a non-story really I think it's just gonna be another light coin

06:44.200 --> 06:49.100
it's gonna drop off here's why I think it's well maybe maybe here's why I feel

06:49.100 --> 06:54.560
like this story has some legs is the real thing that's the topic of debate

06:54.560 --> 07:00.880
here is the technology in the blockchain yeah but just a few days ago a lot of

07:00.880 --> 07:06.800
the Bitcoin core team and a lot of the companies came to consensus about how to

07:06.800 --> 07:10.400
go forward with that yeah I don't think I don't think Bitcoin screwed or

07:10.400 --> 07:14.560
anything like that but I think so you know I just made a little reference

07:14.560 --> 07:20.600
there to Linux Foundation I think I think there's real money like huge

07:20.600 --> 07:26.240
money like game-changing going to disrupt the financial industry money in

07:26.240 --> 07:31.240
blockchain technology and so when the block when anything is happening in the

07:31.240 --> 07:35.520
open source blockchain projects I think there is a much bigger technology story

07:35.520 --> 07:41.960
being told there this reminds me of the the distros that forked off and did the

07:41.960 --> 07:46.000
the non system D stuff it feels like the same kind of situation that one and

07:46.000 --> 07:49.680
yeah although in this case the Bitcoin cash people might argue that they're

07:49.680 --> 07:53.700
the more progressive minded folks that well that's what the the non system D

07:53.700 --> 07:59.340
folks that do all right well you know just I wanted to note it because it

07:59.340 --> 08:03.360
happened today there are arguments against this fork larger block sizes

08:03.360 --> 08:06.640
mean there's gonna be more delay and block propagation it'll be harder more

08:06.640 --> 08:10.080
expensive to maintain a node starting a new node from scratch is gonna take

08:10.080 --> 08:13.400
forever to download all that stuff there's it's already massive but it's

08:13.400 --> 08:17.160
kind of interesting that this is one of the whether good or not it's one of the

08:17.160 --> 08:19.800
interesting things about you know cryptocurrencies in general is that

08:19.800 --> 08:22.960
these sorts of things can happen and they can exist off on their own and do

08:22.960 --> 08:27.800
whatever they want and we get to watch yeah and I just saw I just silently sit

08:27.800 --> 08:31.440
here and hope that the last remaining few bitcoins that I have clutched on to

08:31.440 --> 08:37.120
are worth something in a few years amen amen to that so last week we talked to

08:37.120 --> 08:43.520
mr. Martin Wimpress about the Matei or buntu Matei project migration to

08:43.520 --> 08:48.920
github and it looks like this week that the known project might be fancying

08:48.920 --> 08:53.600
themselves a move did you see this one was yeah now it's I don't think it's

08:53.600 --> 08:58.680
gonna be github it looks like it's not github and they say essentially that

08:58.680 --> 09:01.680
they they need to improve their development infrastructure and they want

09:01.680 --> 09:05.880
to provide developers a more efficient integrated featureful way to enjoy a set

09:05.880 --> 09:12.160
of tools they say their current system is getting increasingly antiquated they

09:12.160 --> 09:17.280
use a C get for code hosting and bugzilla for issue tracking Wow are we

09:17.280 --> 09:24.000
calling bugzilla ain't antiquated now yes are we allowed to say that because I

09:24.000 --> 09:26.200
don't think you're allowed to save things like that about open source

09:26.200 --> 09:28.800
software that a lot of open source advocates use I don't I think it's

09:28.800 --> 09:32.480
you're not allowed to say that I'll say it about see get it I'm the proprietary

09:32.480 --> 09:38.960
guy that likes github issues so get lab is open source so if they go to get lab

09:38.960 --> 09:43.680
all good yeah so it looks like it looks like the evaluation has focused on two

09:43.680 --> 09:47.880
main solutions speaking to get lab get lab and fabricator if you're

09:47.880 --> 09:50.480
unfamiliar with these they have a little introduction but beware that they say

09:50.480 --> 09:54.680
the get lab isn't simply a github clone I don't know exactly what they mean by

09:54.680 --> 09:57.280
that but it sounds like in their inference in there is it get lab is

09:57.280 --> 10:01.400
missing features mm-hmm so I did a little diggy little diggy dig and get

10:01.400 --> 10:07.360
lab is MIT licensed so they could they could possibly extend get lab get lab

10:07.360 --> 10:11.920
has a bit of a reputation I don't know if it's fair or not so I'm not making

10:11.920 --> 10:16.240
any judgments but get lab has a reputation for being a little snippety

10:16.240 --> 10:21.120
about upstream acceptance of new patches and stuff like they seem to be pretty

10:21.120 --> 10:25.880
not accepting seems to be the reputation fair or not I don't know so I don't know

10:25.880 --> 10:29.000
if that means that the known project would essentially end up forking a

10:29.000 --> 10:32.720
version to get lab for their own use that's not ideal either because what I

10:32.720 --> 10:38.480
like about bugzilla is it was commonly used in the community so there was more

10:38.480 --> 10:43.920
than one project maintaining it well if gnome forks get lab they'll just remove

10:43.920 --> 10:54.560
features so it's okay maybe the cult I believe that entirely really polished

10:54.560 --> 10:59.480
and we'll have it yeah I don't have a giant header bar to hmm so they figure I

10:59.480 --> 11:02.640
guess I think they've played around with get lab a little bit but anyways they

11:02.640 --> 11:04.920
are they're looking for feedback and that's one of the reasons I threw in our

11:04.920 --> 11:08.540
community news section is they are looking for feedback from the community

11:08.540 --> 11:12.600
especially the gnome community in creating a migration plan based on their

11:12.600 --> 11:16.160
concerns and things like that so it's probably a good time to get involved the

11:16.160 --> 11:20.000
issue tracker seems to be a big part of it for them I'd say I mean I wish them

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
yeah yeah no it is a good idea and the whole going from just like something like

11:25.000 --> 11:31.760
see get to modern interactive you know really rich web UI source control

11:31.760 --> 11:34.520
platforms it's really it can't be like a remarkable shift for a lot of developers

11:34.520 --> 11:37.960
you know there are those I can live and breathe the command line but for a lot

11:37.960 --> 11:40.960
of people like that really makes it easier for them to understand interact

11:40.960 --> 11:45.480
quicker to develop with so I can see that doing good things for the well you

11:45.480 --> 11:49.480
know the number one thing you see is now this is more of a github effect and it

11:49.480 --> 11:53.840
is a get lab effect but the number one thing you see with github is way more

11:53.840 --> 11:58.200
community involvement all of a sudden now get lab benefits from a bit of that

11:58.200 --> 12:01.320
halo effect to monkey calm you wanted to jump in with a point about get lab go

12:01.320 --> 12:06.960
ahead we switched over to get lab just because of the issue tracking and we've

12:06.960 --> 12:12.880
switched everything for well we were SVN so we had to but we've all our

12:12.880 --> 12:17.040
developers are on get lab and issue tracking and even bug integrating some

12:17.040 --> 12:23.040
of the the bug fix technology into our existing switching is just it works

12:23.040 --> 12:28.480
seamlessly so hmm well there you go right there and I think we've seen other

12:28.480 --> 12:31.880
people sort of say that to it especially people in the community speaking I just

12:31.880 --> 12:35.160
want to point out like command line you can still use command line with get lab

12:35.160 --> 12:38.320
and get up sure that's what I exclusively use command line for those

12:38.320 --> 12:42.680
yeah actually I think I think I've never I've only used the command line with

12:42.680 --> 12:48.320
github I've never used any I usually just use the web interface because they

12:48.320 --> 12:51.520
are very oh well yeah I mean to browse it and stuff but I mean like commits

12:51.520 --> 12:56.160
right clone software oh which is useful for like casual users or people who I

12:56.160 --> 13:01.060
tend to like fixing a typo or something never done a repo okay I tend to like it

13:01.060 --> 13:07.040
because I'm a very visual person sure sure that they they surface the stuff in

13:07.040 --> 13:11.480
a very easy to understand way yeah yeah yeah you can even you can even edit the

13:11.480 --> 13:15.680
documents right and get get lab so you don't even have to to do it can do a

13:15.680 --> 13:19.480
remote commit you just open the file edit it and save and commit the changes

13:19.480 --> 13:23.400
right there in the web interface hmm that is nice and I could definitely see

13:23.400 --> 13:26.520
how that would bring in a lot more people Robert you had something you

13:26.520 --> 13:31.680
wanted to contribute go ahead well just saying that also has its own built-in CI

13:31.680 --> 13:36.840
server so you have one you only need to install one thing and you get all the

13:36.840 --> 13:41.840
features from issue tracking to a CI build server yeah yeah pipelining or

13:41.840 --> 13:46.160
built-in one go and it's also it's also pretty straightforward to set up which

13:46.160 --> 13:51.200
is that's pretty compelling too so let's talk about get hub for a second I guess

13:51.200 --> 13:54.200
they had a bit of an outage yesterday that's right I didn't really impact

13:54.200 --> 13:56.560
anything I was doing but probably affected some projects that have moved

13:56.560 --> 14:02.220
over to github and but Wes like he does just just loves to sleuth around github

14:02.220 --> 14:08.560
all day long and he found this project with no description no topics provided

14:08.560 --> 14:14.840
seven commits one contributor but ladies and gentlemen you could be looking at

14:14.840 --> 14:21.400
Google's JPEG killer a lossless JPEG replacement it's called pick PIK and

14:21.400 --> 14:26.280
it's a new lossy image format for the internet and Wes here has this directory

14:26.280 --> 14:31.000
that contains an encoder and a decoder for the format it requires a CPU that

14:31.000 --> 14:35.400
has a FMA compute a little compute chip in it so like a Haswell or better Intel

14:35.400 --> 14:40.960
or a vx2 I think on that no yeah I think those are both x86 technologies so it's

14:40.960 --> 14:44.920
it's like turbocharged by your CPU and then down here at the bottom it says

14:44.920 --> 14:48.220
this is not an official Google product no it ain't but it's just on their

14:48.220 --> 14:55.080
github page so didn't Google already create this with WebP anyway yeah well

14:55.080 --> 14:59.160
WebP would might be to do something else this seems to be like one of the things

14:59.160 --> 15:04.440
that they've done here is they've built a a lossless JPEG repackager like it's

15:04.440 --> 15:10.520
built to replace JPEGs huh I don't know I think it's because PIK is lossy and

15:10.520 --> 15:15.520
WebP is lossless like well didn't you just say it was a lossless JPEG

15:15.520 --> 15:19.680
replace PIK is lossy what is the yeah okay so what is the I guess it just

15:19.680 --> 15:22.240
probably means you can convert from JPEG to this you've already lost with JPEG

15:22.240 --> 15:26.640
it's already compressed what what is the new image format that the internet

15:26.640 --> 15:31.200
phones are gonna have with iOS 11 the HIF or whatever it is he he format it's

15:31.200 --> 15:35.280
actually like I guess it's a standard but yeah so I just I think we're gonna

15:35.280 --> 15:39.320
have a new image but this is probably for Android maybe maybe maybe not it's

15:39.320 --> 15:42.400
just just we could have a new world of image formats all of a sudden us Linux

15:42.400 --> 15:44.960
users have gotten real comfortable to be able to double click on files and we

15:44.960 --> 15:49.680
could have iPhone users and Android users taking pictures and formats that

15:49.680 --> 15:54.700
we can't open and okay so there is a github repository for it H E I F yeah

15:54.700 --> 15:59.120
yeah so sounds like at least from what I'm reading over on H N here it's a

15:59.120 --> 16:05.160
image container format right more like a V can support JPEG h.264 or h.265 so I

16:05.160 --> 16:09.160
think yeah that Apple probably be using a version of h.265 it's similar for in

16:09.160 --> 16:13.240
the HIF container yes which is confusing but think of it as like MKV you can have

16:13.240 --> 16:20.600
x264 or a VP8 file in an MKV can so if they use h.264 or h.265 then you may

16:20.600 --> 16:24.040
have some patent issues or other things with that but my head's spinning not with

16:24.040 --> 16:28.080
JPEG does it really matter though because images already using WebM and WebP and

16:28.080 --> 16:32.480
that's like half the images on the internet yeah okay so they do some

16:32.480 --> 16:35.320
people here do also speculate like like we like we were just talking about that

16:35.320 --> 16:40.160
WebP WebP is lossy and is aimed at low quality and YUV 420 only so pick is

16:40.160 --> 16:43.960
perhaps a broader broader scope I'm always disappointed like when I'm on

16:43.960 --> 16:46.800
Google Plus when I'm accidentally on Google Plus which is the only time I've

16:46.800 --> 16:50.600
ever on Google Plus anymore and I I want to grab something that's funny off of

16:50.600 --> 16:55.160
Google Plus and I grab the image and it's a WebP image I can't put that in

16:55.160 --> 16:58.120
Telegram like that's what I want to do with it right I can't toss it on Twitter

16:58.120 --> 17:02.520
like I can't I gotta like save it to my desktop open it up save it as a JPEG it's

17:02.520 --> 17:05.640
jank wait what it doesn't work on Telegram isn't aren't the stickers WebP

17:05.640 --> 17:08.760
yeah I believe they are well you can't I couldn't get it I couldn't get to attach

17:08.760 --> 17:12.560
as an image that would embed in the in the chapter really yeah that's weird I

17:12.560 --> 17:16.000
could try again but yeah I was like well this is disappointing this is what I

17:16.000 --> 17:20.560
wanted this image for it right exactly all right so while we're talking about

17:20.560 --> 17:23.760
things that are just applicable to just absolutely everybody on the Sun this is

17:23.760 --> 17:26.880
what this is that's what hey can you tell it's summertime everybody there's

17:26.880 --> 17:29.880
something that's been cooking under the Sun and that's the Windows subsystem for

17:29.880 --> 17:33.040
Linux now it's out of beta but that doesn't necessarily mean you can get

17:33.040 --> 17:36.600
your hands on it yet you know how Microsoft works right they like to they

17:36.600 --> 17:40.420
like to announce something that's this is a final product that you can get in

17:40.420 --> 17:44.080
three months so that's what's going on I think with the subsystem for Linux but

17:44.080 --> 17:47.920
Microsoft says they're damn excited they are damn excited to announce that in

17:47.920 --> 17:51.760
Windows 10 fall creators update because that's what we have to name service packs

17:51.760 --> 17:56.640
now due to ship in fall 2017 the Windows subsystem for Linux will no longer be a

17:56.640 --> 18:02.560
beta feature and will become a fully supported Windows feature whoa no more

18:02.560 --> 18:05.880
hacking your Windows box with those drop-down things that just put you in

18:05.880 --> 18:10.040
the insider program and this is great news for those of you who have

18:10.040 --> 18:14.520
considered not switching to Linux and now need an excuse not to because really

18:14.520 --> 18:17.680
what this is doing is it signaling to people that you can now put this in

18:17.680 --> 18:22.400
production in fact Microsoft even promotes this aspect they say now you

18:22.400 --> 18:25.600
can go ahead and integrate this in with your date of it day developer tool set

18:25.600 --> 18:28.480
and become even more productive when building testing and deploying your apps

18:28.480 --> 18:33.680
on Windows 10 which nobody's doing so it doesn't matter anyway when your boss

18:33.680 --> 18:36.840
tells you you have to run Windows then you can just install this and pretend

18:36.840 --> 18:40.200
the problem is that subsystem is not going to matter to like 80% of the

18:40.200 --> 18:43.880
people that are doing development because you can't use it SSHFS to

18:43.880 --> 18:48.640
connect your Linux servers anyway yeah do you hear that that's a quite an edge

18:48.640 --> 18:53.080
case just because you can't use this is that really an edge case do you know how

18:53.080 --> 18:59.920
many people use SSHFS to work on their Linux servers but a lot of people that's

18:59.920 --> 19:03.560
my point it's there's a plenty of people who develop locally and then deploy

19:03.560 --> 19:08.920
using other tools this is HFS isn't the only tool to do that no but I think it's

19:08.920 --> 19:13.880
more common than you think I use SSHFS for something completely different yeah

19:13.880 --> 19:18.120
I mean I think there's I mean there are a lot is it up go on Katie connect uses

19:18.120 --> 19:23.360
as I say SSHFS to remotely access your phone your file manager on your phone

19:23.360 --> 19:27.240
yeah I mean it is definitely a helpful tool but there are a lot of things so

19:27.240 --> 19:33.440
why would you just use win SCP you could just use win SCP right I suppose yeah

19:33.440 --> 19:36.120
I mean it's it would be nice to have it on the command line but there's ways

19:36.120 --> 19:41.360
around it but I I've never I've never tried this I did consider actually

19:41.360 --> 19:43.800
giving this a go but then I realized it's not actually gonna be until the

19:43.800 --> 19:48.760
fall update but the autumn update for our UK actually could you say could you

19:48.760 --> 19:52.680
call it the correct thing it's the fall creators update do they call it the

19:52.680 --> 19:55.280
autumn creators update I know they were they had there's a whole thing like

19:55.280 --> 19:58.000
debate about if they were going to rename it or not I'm not sure which way

19:58.000 --> 20:02.640
they went I thought we were just calling them all redstone updates now I heard

20:02.640 --> 20:07.560
that's why they bought minecraft that would be better yeah see you the only

20:07.560 --> 20:09.840
thing you really have to do is once it's ready is just go into the windows

20:09.840 --> 20:16.440
feature area and check the the windows subsystem for Linux this blog seems to

20:16.440 --> 20:20.280
imply that the only change most people are gonna notice is that they just

20:20.280 --> 20:24.320
didn't put beta in parentheses next to the subsystem name like they really

20:24.320 --> 20:29.760
haven't changed much since then fascinating we have gone from Microsoft

20:29.760 --> 20:36.520
and canonical co-announcing this feature to now Seuss is on here isn't Fedora

20:36.520 --> 20:40.680
tooth but it was a little I think so yeah I just you know arch onto the now

20:40.680 --> 20:44.280
Ubuntu and yeah people are putting arch on there it is so maybe while you're

20:44.280 --> 20:47.600
doing your your new challenge you can see if you can put that on there it's

20:47.600 --> 20:50.720
like we're on Windows yeah that just seems like the ultimate you know our

20:50.720 --> 20:54.200
machine for the slack worst challenge segment I'm sorry I'm sorry toss it in

20:54.200 --> 20:59.320
there toss it in there I haven't seen any promo from any other

20:59.320 --> 21:05.520
distros featured in there makes me wonder if maybe they're ashamed of it so

21:05.520 --> 21:11.200
not only have they been very quiet since the announcement but they were mums when

21:11.200 --> 21:16.640
it was announced initially and I mean so we have two mums we have mumps on no

21:16.640 --> 21:21.000
details about what was gonna go in there it was only something Microsoft said and

21:21.000 --> 21:24.320
then and then once it's actually in there really no promotion from the

21:24.320 --> 21:27.760
projects either it is extremely awkward and I wonder if it's a little bit of

21:27.760 --> 21:32.400
that Novell partnership shame when Novell teamed up with Microsoft back in

21:32.400 --> 21:37.480
the day and then Sousa was just punished publicly for it so harshly I wonder if

21:37.480 --> 21:41.480
that's I wonder if they're just gun shy from that kind of stuff but yeah to me

21:41.480 --> 21:44.760
it seems like something you'd want to promote and the windows the windows news

21:44.760 --> 21:49.200
outlets like your Paul Therot and your Mary Jo Foley's they were they were

21:49.200 --> 21:54.360
talking about it quite a bit so people knew anyways I haven't got a chance to

21:54.360 --> 21:57.480
try but now I actually feel like maybe that now it's coming out of beta maybe I

21:57.480 --> 22:00.840
actually should just give it a go but that would mean installing Windows 10 so

22:00.840 --> 22:04.040
I really got to make it worth it I would really gotta it's gotta be content like

22:04.040 --> 22:06.760
something else I could do on Windows 10 you know it's like if you're gonna

22:06.760 --> 22:10.200
travel somewhere you don't go there just for the sandwich like you might really

22:10.200 --> 22:13.440
want that sandwich yeah is that my only person you're right okay cuz sometimes

22:13.440 --> 22:17.000
there's places that make really good sandwiches you need to try it I haven't

22:17.000 --> 22:20.580
eaten but you can't tell family members it's just too embarrassing I think I

22:20.580 --> 22:23.360
should have lunch after this yeah you know what let's take a moment let's

22:23.360 --> 22:28.840
take a moment stop talking about sandwiches damn it Wes let's talk about

22:28.840 --> 22:34.960
ting go to linux.ting.com to support the show and get $25 in ting credit or if

22:34.960 --> 22:38.200
you're gonna if if you're if you're gonna buy a brand new device they'll

22:38.200 --> 22:42.120
give you $25 off the device too that's pretty nice you go to linux.ting.com

22:42.120 --> 22:47.040
it's just pay for what you use wireless a fair price however much you talk text

22:47.040 --> 22:51.960
or however much data you use it's $6 for the line and then your usage on top of

22:51.960 --> 22:56.040
that for your minutes your messages and your megabytes nationwide coverage no

22:56.040 --> 23:01.320
contracts no quote-unquote agreements a dashboard better than any other phone or

23:01.320 --> 23:07.240
carrier on the market they support GSM and CDMA phones they have a network for

23:07.240 --> 23:12.840
both so check their BYOD page you can buy directly from them or bring your own

23:12.840 --> 23:15.560
that's I've done a little bit of both myself one of the things I really like

23:15.560 --> 23:19.080
to suggest about ting too is to constantly check their social network

23:19.080 --> 23:22.920
because they're they have been doing a giveaway of them some moto g4 s's I

23:22.920 --> 23:26.720
believe it was and if you check their page for their shop page but start start

23:26.720 --> 23:30.280
by going to linux.ting.com they'll often have deals on stuff like they've got SIM

23:30.280 --> 23:33.600
cards for nine bucks they got the Cadillac phones there at the top and

23:33.600 --> 23:37.360
then you go down they got some they got some amazing deals especially it's

23:37.360 --> 23:40.380
depending on what you need from a phone like they have flip phone stuff they have

23:40.380 --> 23:45.000
my fives just tons of phones look at all these phones look at this they have look

23:45.000 --> 23:50.040
at this West one two three four five six seven they have seven phones under a

23:50.040 --> 23:54.360
hundred bucks Wow and then the e4 just added $129 buy

23:54.360 --> 24:00.040
one so you have a backup in case you break your box nice phone yeah I know

24:00.040 --> 24:03.920
right I'm feeling maybe what I problem is is my hand-me-downs don't run Android

24:03.920 --> 24:06.000
anymore that is one thing people complain about to me they're like yeah

24:06.000 --> 24:09.480
but what if I need to go I can't go to the the Verizon store or whatever and I

24:09.480 --> 24:12.160
mean I think one you know there are other stores but to like at those prices

24:12.160 --> 24:16.280
you can just buy one as a backup well and I've been with Noah on the road when

24:16.280 --> 24:19.560
he damaged his phone he went into Best Buy he bought an unlocked phone he put a

24:19.560 --> 24:23.200
ting sim in and he was back online within minutes it's it's really flexible

24:23.200 --> 24:29.680
linux.ting.com so I want to just mention Nitrux it's the most beautiful Linux

24:29.680 --> 24:32.480
distribution ever and I teased it last week and then we didn't have a chance to

24:32.480 --> 24:35.560
talk about it and I would have just let it pass by because everybody likes to

24:35.560 --> 24:42.440
make these claims oh it's the most beautiful Linux ever I've heard that before right

24:42.440 --> 24:46.680
we've all been romanced with that it's the beauty most beautiful Mac clone ever

24:46.680 --> 24:50.560
it does look a little Mac OS-ish I suppose it sort of had but it has

24:50.560 --> 24:57.880
elementary style launcher with a with a with a dock down below and a persistent

24:57.880 --> 25:03.040
bar along the top but it's actually plasma 5 and cute and it's based on

25:03.040 --> 25:07.240
Ubuntu 1710 and I don't know it's you know I've been I've been recently

25:07.240 --> 25:11.480
looking at Netrunner and Maui Linux I'm going to review Maui Linux Chase and I

25:11.480 --> 25:15.400
are gonna talk about Maui Linux the next user mm-hmm so we got I've been trying

25:15.400 --> 25:20.040
out different plasma based distros recently sort of whittling my way to my

25:20.040 --> 25:24.120
final destination like this new distro hoppin Chris it's fun I know I've done

25:24.120 --> 25:29.760
like three distros in like the last week I am getting around so if you want to if

25:29.760 --> 25:34.760
you want a really fancy nitricks or a plasma themed desktop you go check it

25:34.760 --> 25:40.840
out they call it the Nomad desktop how did we talk about this okay I used it a

25:40.840 --> 25:46.520
little bit did you do you have did you have a follow-up at all no it's it's it's

25:46.520 --> 25:51.280
a little clunky yeah like it's got a lot of cool ideas but you know it's in some

25:51.280 --> 25:57.000
massive beta so I kind of automatically just classify the clunkiness to the beta

25:57.000 --> 26:00.680
part because they're basing on a beta and all their stuff is a beta so it's

26:00.680 --> 26:05.560
hard to say that yeah any of the bugs I experienced were you know game changes

26:05.560 --> 26:09.720
or anything so you go so there's a lot of cool ideas they've been doing yeah

26:09.720 --> 26:13.480
wait so there was some things that impressed you yeah I want to use some of

26:13.480 --> 26:19.440
their applets and neon but like I like the the notification is really I really

26:19.440 --> 26:23.720
like that applet because they rebuilt the whole system tray yeah and I think I

26:23.720 --> 26:29.020
think they did that pretty well but the system D module for system settings I

26:29.020 --> 26:32.880
want that to be put in the regular plasma yeah yeah that's that jumped out

26:32.880 --> 26:36.440
at me too in the screenshot there well thank you around thanks for the thank

26:36.440 --> 26:41.080
you for the follow-up on it I I started to get a sense we talked about I

26:41.080 --> 26:43.800
realized you this what happens if I don't drink a beer before the show so I

26:43.800 --> 26:47.000
fast then I and then I go in here and these kinds of things come up so

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
producer Michael coming in with the follow-up to save the segment thank you

26:50.000 --> 26:55.240
sir and while we're talking about plasma desktop type things like the plasma

26:55.240 --> 27:01.280
desktop applications there's a real situation going on with Corita the

27:01.280 --> 27:07.560
creative foundation appears to be in a bit of peril and this is a first I was

27:07.560 --> 27:11.680
like a foundation for Corita like Jesus does every project need a foundation

27:11.680 --> 27:14.040
like what the hell's going on here I mean I was a little skeptical at first

27:14.040 --> 27:17.560
but this is how they are able to pay for one of their full-time developers it's

27:17.560 --> 27:22.120
actually just sort of the way things go mm-hmm our buddy I key today on patreon

27:22.120 --> 27:26.240
announced that they're starting the legal framework to set up a company or

27:26.240 --> 27:29.120
own solace same thing like you just there's gets to it that's why I did

27:29.120 --> 27:31.720
Jupiter broadcasting eventually it's just where you get to eventually where

27:31.720 --> 27:35.400
it's like crap now I gotta do this so the creative folks have a foundation

27:35.400 --> 27:40.680
it helps pay for you know some things and people and things like that and

27:40.680 --> 27:43.960
they're getting their taxes online and they figured everything would be fine

27:43.960 --> 27:47.360
since they hired a lawyer to help set everything up and they checked all the

27:47.360 --> 27:51.120
boxes beforehand and they've been doing everything that lawyer consultant told

27:51.120 --> 27:55.800
them to do however they ended up getting flagged in the tax inspector found two

27:55.800 --> 28:02.280
problems and essentially they're caught in a real catch-22 because they claimed

28:02.280 --> 28:09.760
back that for things that they bought by the foundation but they also took besides

28:09.760 --> 28:15.200
taking in donations also sold some things like swag or documentation or

28:15.200 --> 28:21.000
guides and so they weren't 100% donation based they were also kind of a company

28:21.000 --> 28:25.560
so they're mostly not a company but they're also kind of a company and so

28:25.560 --> 28:30.600
they're getting screwed on both ends of that and they have a tax bill of 24,000

28:30.600 --> 28:36.080
euros right now as a result they got a little down to 15,000 but then the tax

28:36.080 --> 28:44.480
accountant bill came out to 4,000 euros so it is a bad situation it is really

28:44.480 --> 28:49.280
bad and there's also kind of confusing because the primary full-time developer

28:49.280 --> 28:53.520
was in Russia and so they didn't pay some of the taxes that they thought they

28:53.520 --> 28:56.960
should have or something like that they weren't they weren't required they were

28:56.960 --> 28:59.480
trying to charge them for things that they were not required to do because he

28:59.480 --> 29:03.200
was in Russia yeah there you go there you go thank you so that's just a bad

29:03.200 --> 29:07.600
situation for them because you you you realize when you read this post that

29:07.600 --> 29:12.840
they essentially did everything right and it's just like if you're in here in

29:12.840 --> 29:15.600
the States the way you would get the way you would have gotten around this

29:15.600 --> 29:17.840
because I obviously can't apply it over there but here in the States the way you

29:17.840 --> 29:21.360
would have gotten around that is the fee for the books and the DVDs and stuff

29:21.360 --> 29:25.380
would have been a gift of a donation a donation amount gifted you know you could

29:25.380 --> 29:30.520
make a donation of five dollars or more and we'll send you these DVDs and

29:30.520 --> 29:33.840
that's how you get around this problem in the States I don't know how you get

29:33.840 --> 29:36.920
around it outside the States but that's you know because if you walk you have to

29:36.920 --> 29:40.080
really be careful if you're a if you're a foundation or a nonprofit in the

29:40.080 --> 29:44.360
States you really got to watch that because the IRS will get you and they

29:44.360 --> 29:48.120
got got so it looks like now they've spun off as a separate company that will

29:48.120 --> 29:52.440
take that income and then the main foundation can be 100% make sense that's

29:52.440 --> 29:55.640
how you should do it and this is why even nonprofits and open source

29:55.640 --> 30:00.200
companies have lawyers on retainer yeah and fees and things even though it costs

30:00.200 --> 30:04.600
a crap ton it's cheaper in the long run yeah wow man they've also spent the

30:04.600 --> 30:07.920
other thing that is just we've just talked the hard numbers and stuff but

30:07.920 --> 30:10.840
think about the stress of this on these guys right you know they just want to

30:10.840 --> 30:14.600
make great open source design software great great software then they have to

30:14.600 --> 30:19.000
take months of their development time to resolve this issue it's eaten to their

30:19.000 --> 30:23.400
coding productivity it's they they could they were too distressed by all this and

30:23.400 --> 30:28.200
too busy to do their usual May fundraiser so their revenue is down they

30:28.200 --> 30:30.560
thought at one point they're gonna almost certainly go broke but like a

30:30.560 --> 30:33.760
couple of hero donors stepped up that's awesome and kept them going for a little

30:33.760 --> 30:37.640
bit and so you need sitting there at the end of the day you're like how we just

30:37.640 --> 30:40.720
haven't been as productive if we wanted well I wouldn't be like dealing with

30:40.720 --> 30:43.640
taxes like this is the entire this is the opposite of I wanted when I wanted

30:43.640 --> 30:47.840
to make my badass new you know illustrating software it's really sad

30:47.840 --> 30:50.880
because you know it's just you just want to make open source software you don't

30:50.880 --> 30:53.960
have to do all this exactly they've done that I've not even tried to make money

30:53.960 --> 30:57.480
and they had a consultant home you know and it's just you could see how years

30:57.480 --> 31:01.240
go by and now you've sold a few DVDs you don't even think about it of course you

31:01.240 --> 31:04.080
think it's all going into the foundation spot it's all going towards work and all

31:04.080 --> 31:09.640
that but yeah so create a foundation is in it's sort of a bad situation but

31:09.640 --> 31:13.320
they're posting year-end reports and I'm just kind of following this I don't

31:13.320 --> 31:17.160
really see them like begging for money here but they do have a they do have a

31:17.160 --> 31:20.280
spot on this post which we have linked in the show notes it's also created

31:20.280 --> 31:24.400
org where you can make a one-time donation or a reoccurring donation it's

31:24.400 --> 31:28.320
got a $1 minimum so yeah if you know like I know Albert Wester is a huge user

31:28.320 --> 31:34.320
of Krita if anybody really loves Krita send them 14 grand yeah right to help

31:34.320 --> 31:38.200
them out nearly loves Krita I'll tell you yeah you really got to love it yeah

31:38.200 --> 31:42.440
you really got to do so let's let's talk a little more a community news I'm

31:42.440 --> 31:45.040
liking this so we're kind of sticking to community stuff and Linux unplugged

31:45.040 --> 31:49.360
and when I look at Firefox from like a community perspective I don't hate it

31:49.360 --> 31:52.720
like Popey does I know Popey's a big Firefox hater these days only uses how

31:52.720 --> 31:58.120
dare you but I actually get more excited about some of the things they're working

31:58.120 --> 32:01.360
on from that like project common voice is really neat we've been covering that

32:01.360 --> 32:05.880
on the Linux action news and now my friends I invite you to go to test

32:05.880 --> 32:11.720
pilot dot Firefox comm slash experiments and check out some of this goodness here

32:11.720 --> 32:16.720
so this will be this will be relevant later on in the show voice fill which is

32:16.720 --> 32:20.320
a speaker a speech recognition in Firefox a voice fill lets you speak to

32:20.320 --> 32:23.500
your favorite search engines and fill in the information using Firefox to do the

32:23.500 --> 32:28.160
processing encrypt a send that's what this is the one we're gonna play with

32:28.160 --> 32:32.680
probably send which is an encrypted file transfer it generates a link and you

32:32.680 --> 32:36.640
can send it to people like in an email or something like that this one I really

32:36.640 --> 32:42.440
like snooze tabs right website wrong time snooze it until you need it yeah

32:42.440 --> 32:46.920
snooze tabs lets you dismiss tabs now and set an alarm to open them later

32:46.920 --> 32:56.880
that's neat but then they take it up a notch containers contain yourselves

32:56.880 --> 33:01.680
create different containers for each of your online lives your work self your

33:01.680 --> 33:07.720
social self your personal self to stay organized and maintain privacy that

33:07.720 --> 33:12.120
actually almost kind of registers with me because my hack for that right now is

33:12.120 --> 33:18.080
either incognito mode which is transient or I spread it out across like three web

33:18.080 --> 33:21.920
browsers so my three main accounts I like to bang around in all the time I

33:21.920 --> 33:25.200
spread it out and then you know it's like my personal account my work account

33:25.200 --> 33:28.240
and then maybe like one of the show accounts that I'm reading the news or

33:28.240 --> 33:33.320
the email feedback for for that but if I could do containers

33:33.760 --> 33:39.120
that just sounds like the kind of ridiculousness I might get into I'm not

33:39.120 --> 33:42.400
sure if they're really doing Docker or what I'm kind of let's go take a look

33:42.400 --> 33:45.400
yeah they also have a few other ones like I was saying they have the send one

33:45.400 --> 33:48.000
which is pretty neat send lets you upload in encrypt large files up to a

33:48.000 --> 33:50.640
gigabyte so that's another way you you and I were just talking about sending

33:50.640 --> 33:54.640
files around before the show the Firefox tab containers are not

33:54.640 --> 33:58.720
necessarily containers they are session individual session sure sure yes it's

33:58.720 --> 34:02.160
not like Docker or something like that and I know it's actually to me it's

34:02.160 --> 34:06.320
it's what I've been wanting for years yeah and what I've had to do like weird

34:06.320 --> 34:10.640
workarounds to like make my own browser structures and stuff it's got to build

34:10.640 --> 34:13.640
like things built on electron it's container ization of like the user

34:13.640 --> 34:17.800
profiles right or personas right personas that's yeah yeah that's the

34:17.800 --> 34:22.520
part which is great because that's I have like 35 personas in Chrome and this

34:22.520 --> 34:25.520
is one of the big things that has kept me from Firefox I know I moan about

34:25.520 --> 34:29.720
Firefox but this is one of the big things that it's it just isn't currently

34:29.720 --> 34:35.360
very good having a large number of very separate profiles and having all of them

34:35.360 --> 34:38.960
or a large number of them open at the same time it just can't do that

34:38.960 --> 34:49.360
yeah I have tried it there's an add-on that does literally what this new

34:49.360 --> 34:52.360
feature is going to do like it's individual tabs that had different

34:52.360 --> 34:57.280
profiles associated like choose which profile you want on what tab huh so you

34:57.280 --> 34:59.960
could oh yeah it looks like you can do that with this feature too you'll be

34:59.960 --> 35:03.800
able to set it up you can have each tab be its own that's even more useful so

35:03.800 --> 35:07.840
instead of having multiple windows yeah that's I guess that's the way Chrome does

35:07.840 --> 35:12.360
it now because we have a family machine at the RV the lot that everybody sits

35:12.360 --> 35:14.920
down at so we have different personas there on Chrome which is really nice and

35:14.920 --> 35:18.940
then this mumble machine has Chrome with different personas on it for different

35:18.940 --> 35:21.960
hosts that sit down and we use that quite a bit but it always spawns a whole

35:21.960 --> 35:26.400
new window yeah it's not on separate tabs this is like a full this is just

35:26.400 --> 35:30.440
using electrolysis that it's like like potential of like we're really what it's

35:30.440 --> 35:34.440
great for so you're saying this is maximum electrolysis that's what this is

35:34.440 --> 35:38.120
the like this separation of processes but also separation of profiles on top

35:38.120 --> 35:42.640
of the processes whereas Chrome is just processes no no no profile structure

35:42.640 --> 35:46.440
let's be real like you have a full profile but you can't have individual

35:46.440 --> 35:50.160
tab sessions whereas this would do that people are only really ever gonna have

35:50.160 --> 35:52.360
three containers they're gonna have a home container they're gonna have a work

35:52.360 --> 35:55.720
container and they're never porn container oh yeah I was thinking I was

35:55.720 --> 35:58.520
thinking like shopping and stuff but you're right a porn container would

35:58.520 --> 36:01.880
probably wait why do you even need a porn container surely that's what just

36:01.880 --> 36:07.720
that decognito is for yeah I suppose I guess he gets sick and tired of because

36:07.720 --> 36:10.640
incognito doesn't save cookies you'd have to log in every single time I guess

36:10.640 --> 36:15.680
that's what yeah I really don't it's not saving my saving those you'll have you'll

36:15.680 --> 36:19.760
have your encrypted porn container password cookies yeah there you go I'm

36:19.760 --> 36:23.720
totally not liking this video on Facebook that's for sure just wait till

36:23.720 --> 36:27.160
you have the version that integrates into a system D and then you'll have it

36:27.160 --> 36:30.320
down all the way contained that's really what up that's what I'm gonna be excited

36:30.320 --> 36:34.000
so I sent you a I sent you with the a test link there oh where did you in the

36:34.000 --> 36:37.840
chat oh yeah okay all right I'll bring that up so is this using the new

36:37.840 --> 36:41.680
Firefox and I installed it right there in Firefox and everything so you it

36:41.680 --> 36:45.200
works in Chrome or Firefox I noticed so that's a good thing it's interesting too

36:45.200 --> 36:48.520
because it's kind of a like a web infrastructure play and not a browser

36:48.520 --> 36:53.360
yeah they're hosting this somewhere right yeah okay so yeah the URL is it's

36:53.360 --> 36:57.800
an HTTPS and it's send up firefox.com slash download and then a character

36:57.800 --> 37:01.880
string and then a hash after that so that's like a interesting so I wonder if

37:01.880 --> 37:06.340
you I wonder if that hashtag if that hashes of the file is persistent anyways

37:06.340 --> 37:12.360
yeah okay so then it is it safe is it safe to download a crappy webcam picture

37:12.360 --> 37:17.000
of me so I'm gonna download and then yeah it's downloaded super fast and boom

37:17.000 --> 37:21.520
there it is this is actually Firefox back or launching their dropbox

37:21.520 --> 37:25.120
competitor yeah well in a way like why does Mozilla want to get into the file

37:25.120 --> 37:31.480
hosting of kind of funny competitor to we transfer yeah but do they really want

37:31.480 --> 37:35.780
to be policing child porn and terror and pictures of Isis beheadings in some ways

37:35.780 --> 37:39.380
it seems kind of like a desperate ploy of like I mean Chrome tries to be so

37:39.380 --> 37:43.040
useful with all the things Google does they kind of have to do the same isn't

37:43.040 --> 37:46.080
are they doing it permanent thing because it sounds if they're doing a we

37:46.080 --> 37:49.360
transfer structure it's like every act once a day they wipe yeah there is

37:49.360 --> 37:52.800
expiration yeah aren't you so it's like it's basically like we transfer so you

37:52.800 --> 37:54.960
think that means they don't have to police it as much though is that true

37:54.960 --> 37:58.720
yeah because they're just gonna delete it anyway yeah so you you once you use

37:58.720 --> 38:02.880
it's mainly for just like if you have a giant file you can't reasonably send to

38:02.880 --> 38:05.960
someone you can upload it to here send it to them give them a link they

38:05.960 --> 38:11.260
download it then it's gone I don't think you deleting it quickly obviates you

38:11.260 --> 38:16.000
from sticking to the legal framework in the country that you operate you can't

38:16.000 --> 38:21.800
say I had the child porn on my computer for half an hour officer therefore I and

38:21.800 --> 38:25.120
it's gone now therefore it's not a problem well as far as like the legal

38:25.120 --> 38:28.840
ramifications for Firefox it's like how are they gonna find that they have this

38:28.840 --> 38:33.640
information if they don't have you know they don't have they can't say oh we

38:33.640 --> 38:36.960
found this we can report it to you you have 30 days to get rid of it or

38:36.960 --> 38:41.400
something you have to make action but it's already gone when they're when

38:41.400 --> 38:46.960
they're monitoring some nonce who's using this to transfer files back and

38:46.960 --> 38:50.800
forth and they're monitoring the URLs they certainly can go after them for

38:50.800 --> 38:55.560
having distributed the data not that they're necessarily hosting it anymore

38:55.560 --> 38:59.800
but they did distribute it so the fact that it's gone isn't gonna help them in

38:59.800 --> 39:04.480
when it comes to their time in court I mean there's like 20 of these services

39:04.480 --> 39:07.080
right now so I'm wondering how they handle that then because they have the

39:07.080 --> 39:10.840
same situation I think what you say is certainly true but I imagine they will

39:10.840 --> 39:13.560
be a much lower priority at least seems like a lot of these like you can

39:13.560 --> 39:17.400
download this once and then it expires so I imagine priority be given to places

39:17.400 --> 39:20.320
that are actually distributing it in a meaningful way rather than one-on-one

39:20.320 --> 39:24.200
okay so bringing this conversation back to Firefox itself it sounds like mini

39:24.200 --> 39:30.120
mac has been banging around on beta 55 how's that been going I tell you it's a

39:30.120 --> 39:37.840
real pleasure I mean for 54 was even and what's getting better but 55 is really

39:37.840 --> 39:42.600
cool a lot of less memory usage you can use it on really small systems and it's

39:42.600 --> 39:46.400
running really great I was really surprised that's a certainly faster

39:46.400 --> 39:50.200
really yeah it's noticeable if anyone ever problem with like with using

39:50.200 --> 39:57.760
Firefox before and it from like Firefox like 45 46 or so up to 54 they've been

39:57.760 --> 40:01.160
pretty they've been getting faster and faster but it's like you know very

40:01.160 --> 40:05.000
barely noticeable like if you go get 45 and you then you compare it to 54 you'll

40:05.000 --> 40:09.680
notice a difference but like in between individuals but 54 to 55 you can easily

40:09.680 --> 40:13.600
tell a difference all right definitely I agree I want to know what it would take

40:13.600 --> 40:18.040
for you to give it a go for you to actually use it because you are all in

40:18.040 --> 40:22.680
on Chrome I have no reason to use it so it's not even a consideration like what

40:22.680 --> 40:26.400
if it's faster like what if it what if it renders pages faster is it less

40:26.400 --> 40:31.480
crashy because every time I've tried to use Firefox I run into crashing issues

40:31.480 --> 40:36.000
hmm I'll tell you I mean it's less crazy for me yeah I I would imagine right

40:36.000 --> 40:39.200
because the technology changes they're making would would have to lend the

40:39.200 --> 40:42.960
stabilities I am I'm also unusual use case though because I have literally

40:42.960 --> 40:48.760
hundreds and hundreds of tabs I use well I use about 150 tabs but so I don't

40:48.760 --> 40:53.360
probably have as many as you but I have a significant amount and the new the new

40:53.360 --> 40:57.400
structure structure with the electrolysis plus the 55 speed increase

40:57.400 --> 41:03.200
is noticeably difference and like if there is crashing now that it's a much

41:03.200 --> 41:08.000
cleaner and elegant like replacement it doesn't it doesn't crash it's entirely

41:08.000 --> 41:13.120
just like this process goes away that's very encouraging I'm also kind of tied

41:13.120 --> 41:16.280
into the the Chrome infrastructure because there's a lot of specialized

41:16.280 --> 41:21.100
extensions that I use yeah that don't have direct Firefox replacements yeah

41:21.100 --> 41:25.240
they probably they probably will soon especially with the with 55 and above

41:25.240 --> 41:28.880
you can use web extensions that are essentially Chrome extensions ported to

41:28.880 --> 41:34.360
Firefox interesting that is so 57 is gonna be only web extensions but 55

41:34.360 --> 41:39.220
actually 53 introduced like the web extension as an option so there's

41:39.220 --> 41:42.440
already a lot of extensions that are already built for their ported to

41:42.440 --> 41:47.240
Firefox right now in the Firefox market like add-on market see the problem for

41:47.240 --> 41:53.020
me is and as a former Firefox extension developer is that Firefox keeps changing

41:53.020 --> 41:56.920
their extensions there's been like six different iterations of extensions so

41:56.920 --> 42:01.080
and like three of them are deprecated now so you can't guarantee that your

42:01.080 --> 42:04.600
extensions are gonna be there in six months yeah there is that well I mean

42:04.600 --> 42:07.160
that's one of the reasons they're using web extensions as the infrastructure now

42:07.160 --> 42:11.440
they're making it to like a consolidated type like you know this one

42:11.440 --> 42:14.360
framework is what's gonna be used for most browsers that's what they did to

42:14.360 --> 42:18.480
pitch the last four extension things though yeah but they're they're they

42:18.480 --> 42:22.400
were the only ones that controlled that framework so people the other browsers

42:22.400 --> 42:26.400
didn't want to agree with that a framework and they so Firefox is now

42:26.400 --> 42:29.440
essentially it's Firefox is giving into web extension I'll tell you it's so that

42:29.440 --> 42:33.800
so in the discord chat this who just brought it up somebody just brought up

42:33.800 --> 42:37.760
in the discord chat Firefox is touchscreen support Mazda did and that

42:37.760 --> 42:42.240
is that is a it is a limitation of Firefox that we don't talk about because

42:42.240 --> 42:45.960
how many of us are using touchscreens but you know guess what we have a

42:45.960 --> 42:48.840
touchscreen here in the studio and so every now and then I got pull up a web

42:48.840 --> 42:55.600
browser on it and you just Firefox is a disaster and Chrome is much better 55 is

42:55.600 --> 42:58.960
improved the touch a little bit as far as like the scrolling at because even

42:58.960 --> 43:03.040
Firefox touch scrolling used to be atrocious and it's it's a lot better now

43:03.040 --> 43:07.400
with 55 I wouldn't say it's probably as good as Chrome because Chrome is a lot

43:07.400 --> 43:12.400
more cohesive but I would say by the time 55 comes out it's possible that it

43:12.400 --> 43:18.040
might so going back to the experiments for a second isn't that exactly the kind

43:18.040 --> 43:24.280
of thing that people were giving Firefox crap about doing like six twelve months

43:24.280 --> 43:28.080
ago where they weren't focusing on their core browser and improving the core

43:28.080 --> 43:31.760
browser things like hello yeah and they were don't you think but well okay send

43:31.760 --> 43:37.160
is the is probably the the the the biggest hello you know okay that that I

43:37.160 --> 43:41.480
agree but the tab stuff is actually in container stuff's actually pretty nice

43:41.480 --> 43:44.040
like this kid like the sleeping a tab and then having it come back at a

43:44.040 --> 43:47.560
scheduled time genius actually some of them are definitely

43:47.560 --> 43:51.280
improvements to the browser but some of them feel like just ancillary projects

43:51.280 --> 43:55.560
that are yeah the sleeping tab is already ability is already usable like

43:55.560 --> 43:59.640
you can do it now but it like the timer stuff is really cool but like there's I

43:59.640 --> 44:03.080
think the experiments are great because a lot of people talked about how

44:03.080 --> 44:06.880
Firefox is removing features in there but it's becoming like a crappy clone of

44:06.880 --> 44:10.600
Chrome or whatever like not even using the engine or whatever and and then just

44:10.600 --> 44:13.400
keeping these you know Firefox is changing all these things and it's

44:13.400 --> 44:16.520
making Firefox no longer as good as it was but now they're introducing these

44:16.520 --> 44:20.320
potentially like game changer features like the container structure of the

44:20.320 --> 44:25.080
profiles and session management that would make me I that would be that the

44:25.080 --> 44:29.320
the main reason I could say you should use Firefox over any other browser

44:29.320 --> 44:34.080
because you can control the session per tab and if you want to go to like I want

44:34.080 --> 44:38.240
to log into Twitter ten times with ten different accounts no problem ready to

44:38.240 --> 44:41.320
go that seems really compelling I'm gonna definitely give be giving it a go

44:41.320 --> 44:44.960
absolutely hundred percent I'm actually kind of funny I'm at the point with

44:44.960 --> 44:48.500
Chrome where I was that with Firefox when I switched away where the sync

44:48.500 --> 44:52.240
feature is finally finally finally biting me in the ass it took a long time

44:52.240 --> 44:57.080
so I got to give the Chrome folks credit for that but extensions that I removed I

44:57.080 --> 45:00.880
pared down my browser extensions ages ago well you tried to yep they're

45:00.880 --> 45:04.920
repopping back up and the ones that I need most critically are failing on the

45:04.920 --> 45:07.520
machine that I needed the most critically which is the machine that's

45:07.520 --> 45:11.960
on the live stream and so those things are all like they're not I can go back

45:11.960 --> 45:16.240
in I can repair the extension and then I can reload all my tabs so it's I have a

45:16.240 --> 45:20.520
workaround but I'm looking at that Firefox and I'm going I love what

45:20.520 --> 45:23.320
they're about and I love what they're doing it's gonna be time for me to kick

45:23.320 --> 45:27.320
the tires again absolutely especially if you if you wish want to try out the beta

45:27.320 --> 45:32.720
it's definitely worth trying it like even now because it runs so fast it's

45:32.720 --> 45:39.320
shocking so there's a story that I wasn't gonna cover but I've been seen in

45:39.320 --> 45:45.440
the chat room and a hashtag blame poppy it's coming up again and it seems to be

45:45.440 --> 45:49.720
discussion-worthy because the chat rooms talking about it a lot and there was a

45:49.720 --> 45:53.800
there was a section in the new Red Hat Enterprise release so Red Hat just put

45:53.800 --> 46:00.320
out I believe a 7.4 Red Hat Enterprise and you may or may not realize it in

46:00.320 --> 46:04.400
every release they have a deprecated functionality section so in the chapter

46:04.400 --> 46:10.680
53 of the release notes of Red Hat Enterprise 7.4 they have the deprecated

46:10.680 --> 46:14.760
functionality chapter of course that's what that's what everybody uses that's

46:14.760 --> 46:17.560
what everybody does with chapter 53 right favorite chapter deprecated

46:17.560 --> 46:21.680
functionality and the one that is getting the chat rooms attention today

46:21.680 --> 46:28.280
is they're dropping butter fs they're pulling back on butter fs and it seems

46:28.280 --> 46:33.120
to be what everybody wants to talk about so I thought I'd open it up hmm I'll

46:33.120 --> 46:36.680
start with the announcement the they say the butter fs file system has been a

46:36.680 --> 46:39.400
technology preview state since the initial release of Red Hat Enterprise

46:39.400 --> 46:43.760
Linux 6 and Red Hat will not be moving butter fs to a fully supported feature

46:43.760 --> 46:49.840
and it will be removed in a future major release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux

46:49.840 --> 46:55.520
Poby is this a is this a bad bad sign for butter fs is this essentially the

46:55.520 --> 47:00.200
death of butter fs for the enterprise file system I you know I really can't

47:00.200 --> 47:03.120
tell and I don't know I mean they're hedging their bets and saying it'll be

47:03.120 --> 47:09.200
removed in a later release which they can always change those plans right and

47:09.200 --> 47:13.440
it doesn't say when that would be so that yeah those plans could change but I

47:13.440 --> 47:16.760
find it interesting that like two of the major players in entertainment mix have

47:16.760 --> 47:23.280
taken a completely different stance on this that like for suzer it's like all in

47:23.280 --> 47:30.800
default install yeah integrating package manager with right although I have to

47:30.800 --> 47:35.640
say I have a I updated my when I saw the latest version of open suzer came out I

47:35.640 --> 47:39.000
updated my machine and it all fell apart because it ran out of this space

47:39.000 --> 47:44.720
because all the snaps the what's it called the snapshots of so I've got

47:44.720 --> 47:48.240
snaps on the brain the snapshots from all the updates I don't know the past

47:48.240 --> 47:51.840
caused it to run out of this space so I had to go in and manually like an animal

47:51.840 --> 47:56.000
sure remove these that reminds me of that reminds me of that damn slash boot

47:56.000 --> 48:00.360
directory on my fiance's computer that I have to keep going clean I can't wait to

48:00.360 --> 48:03.760
trigger you I can't wait for that update in 1710 where it automatically cleans it

48:03.760 --> 48:07.840
up that'll be so wonderful but yeah I follow you it is funny because you you

48:07.840 --> 48:13.680
you kind of joke and jest but they are also building new projects on top of

48:13.680 --> 48:16.000
butter fs there they have some stuff they're working on right now that's

48:16.000 --> 48:20.600
really it's integral to it and so that is that you're right it is two major

48:20.600 --> 48:25.240
deviations and then if I unless I'm mistaken right now Ubuntu like if I were

48:25.240 --> 48:29.680
to install the latest LTS of Ubuntu it would default to extended for correct

48:29.680 --> 48:36.040
right and then of course ZFS ZFS is available if you want it which makes a

48:36.040 --> 48:39.400
face and all the others but right you know we don't we don't make butter fs a

48:39.400 --> 48:44.640
first-class citizen like suzer do I wonder you got a wonder though folks in

48:44.640 --> 48:48.520
Red Hat legal right now are working overtime making sure that they can put

48:48.520 --> 48:51.840
ZFS and future versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux I've got to be getting

48:51.840 --> 48:55.360
that from their enterprise customers they've got to be getting that I don't

48:55.360 --> 48:59.040
think there is I would be willing to bet and this is my supposition I admit this

48:59.040 --> 49:03.040
so this is just Chris guessing but I'd be I'd be willing to bet like a steak

49:03.040 --> 49:07.840
dinner that there are at least enterprise customers exist that want to

49:07.840 --> 49:12.920
deploy ZFS there's probably not nearly as many enterprise customers that are

49:12.920 --> 49:16.240
actively seeking to deploy butter fs there's just a difference in brand

49:16.240 --> 49:23.360
recognition so I wonder where Red Hat will go maybe they'll go with XFS hey so

49:23.360 --> 49:27.400
yeah that's the big story because a lot of I think a lot of enterprises kind of

49:27.400 --> 49:32.320
gave up on getting ZFS in in the supported way and so have large

49:32.320 --> 49:38.400
enterprise sands or other solutions that they've kind of adapted to hmm yeah a

49:38.400 --> 49:41.200
lot of those systems have something they just run on top of and they just like

49:41.200 --> 49:45.040
the other solution to yeah when you're really doing large stuff anyways it's a

49:45.040 --> 49:48.880
big release or they switch to a point to check the chat room really zeroed in on

49:48.880 --> 49:52.440
it though I wasn't gonna put it in the show mm-hmm I wasn't gonna put it in the

49:52.440 --> 49:56.600
show because I felt like it would just be butter fs hating but then I thought

49:56.600 --> 50:00.360
about it and I guess it is kind of newsworthy that Red Hats rolling back

50:00.360 --> 50:04.360
from it without really saying where they're going I even read notice

50:04.360 --> 50:11.240
recently my I I didn't even notice until I dug into it my netgear ready nas runs

50:11.240 --> 50:15.720
better fs by default I did I didn't know that until I SSH into it and happened to

50:15.720 --> 50:20.680
type mount for whatever reason I was like oh wow it's actually running it

50:20.680 --> 50:24.400
reliably it's perfectly fine that's good I suppose you know if you really know

50:24.400 --> 50:27.560
what your use case is and you can control all these things and you know it

50:27.560 --> 50:31.440
just it's not like it's it's not like it's destroying everybody's data

50:31.440 --> 50:35.760
everywhere there's lots of people using it but there's just it's like been

50:35.760 --> 50:41.840
labeled though it's been branded yeah well there you go also by the way Red

50:41.840 --> 50:48.280
Hat Enterprise 7.4 is out I guess that also hi there I guess that also didn't

50:48.280 --> 50:51.520
make it into the news anyways there's a few other tweaks in there for the

50:51.520 --> 50:55.480
desktop Nautilus open terminals replaced with gnome terminal Nautilus so brace

50:55.480 --> 51:00.080
yourself ooh brace yourself I like that word ordering yeah yeah there's there's

51:00.080 --> 51:04.440
a win when a new version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 ships the Linux

51:04.440 --> 51:11.000
desktop market shakes no not really not really but maybe one day digital ocean

51:11.000 --> 51:15.480
calm go for digital ocean calm and use our promo code do unplugged after you

51:15.480 --> 51:19.520
sign up it's one word you apply it to your account boom it's magic West you

51:19.520 --> 51:24.080
know what that does it enables you it enables you with a $10 credit to go

51:24.080 --> 51:28.240
create a machine on digital oceans wicked fast infrastructure with all SSDs

51:28.240 --> 51:33.080
unbelievably low pricing and data centers all over the world the entire

51:33.080 --> 51:39.960
friggin infrastructure is SSDs and man did they scream really it's they don't

51:39.960 --> 51:43.960
say what the split the bitrate is there but it's it's it's fast I'll just put it

51:43.960 --> 51:47.760
that way you can get started in less than a minute it's really nice and they

51:47.760 --> 51:51.480
have lightning fast networking everywhere beard how many mean how how

51:51.480 --> 51:55.600
crudel how crude how critical how critical do you think digital ocean is

51:55.600 --> 51:59.240
did you put a broadcasting that's crucial and critical critical I mean

51:59.240 --> 52:03.640
we're live-streaming from digital ocean right now from we're using at least three

52:03.640 --> 52:07.800
three digital ocean droplets to make this show even happen right yeah yeah

52:07.800 --> 52:12.600
and you know you could just spin up an Ubuntu droplet and stick some ZFS on an

52:12.600 --> 52:17.560
SSD on there yeah and they it's actually a really cool way to play with ZFS

52:17.560 --> 52:21.480
because they have block storage which you can scale up to 16 terabytes so you

52:21.480 --> 52:26.760
can mess around with crazy ZFS experiments on their infrastructure just

52:26.760 --> 52:30.400
use our promo code do unplugged and you can do it like run their $5 rig and

52:30.400 --> 52:33.800
attach storage because you don't need like crazy amounts of RAM and CPU just

52:33.800 --> 52:38.080
try it for a little bit and experiment around they also are working on the

52:38.080 --> 52:42.240
object storage as well we're so excited they have a whole but list we were also

52:42.240 --> 52:47.880
earlier talking about GitLab one-click deployment Ubuntu LTS all up-to-date

52:47.880 --> 52:53.080
nice and shiny with GitLab ready to go ready for you to use just one button

52:53.080 --> 52:56.440
deployment of a lot of great open source applications and they have load

52:56.440 --> 52:59.760
balancing as a service they make it really easy if you're in a team and then

52:59.760 --> 53:05.400
an interface for pros or beginners and an API that's to die for digital ocean

53:05.400 --> 53:10.240
comm use our promo code do unplugged and a big thank you to digital ocean for

53:10.240 --> 53:15.800
sponsoring the unplugged a program got a couple of bits of community discussion I

53:15.800 --> 53:20.640
thought we'd pull in here this first one is actually over from our Linux and we

53:20.640 --> 53:23.560
read it so you don't have to this came in though and I thought this is

53:23.560 --> 53:28.880
interesting I really thought about this I thought damn this is an area where I

53:28.880 --> 53:32.640
was hoping by now mycroft was gonna solve he says he writes I recently

53:32.640 --> 53:36.440
injured my hands and wrists and typing is painful boy have I been there

53:36.440 --> 53:40.160
recently mouse use is not so bad but still pretty sore so I'd need voice

53:40.160 --> 53:45.680
control and or transcription software dictation for writing but voice control

53:45.680 --> 53:49.920
for input would be helpful as well I've tried Simon pocket sphinx free speech

53:49.920 --> 53:56.360
all on a boom to 72 1704 none of them work out of the box it might be a cool

53:56.360 --> 53:59.600
gimmick that he talks about some of the other things are in there but for most

53:59.600 --> 54:03.840
people but for me I need it with my certain with my current disabilities and

54:03.840 --> 54:09.360
he says now that I really need it Linux voice control is a total nightmare

54:10.440 --> 54:14.000
so there was a couple of suggestions that came in and I don't know if

54:14.000 --> 54:19.760
anybody in the mumble room or the chat rooms has a suggestion but here's a kind

54:19.760 --> 54:23.920
of a somewhat messy workaround I admit but I actually like this one and it was

54:23.920 --> 54:28.240
from the comments section using KDE connect and I'm not a daily user of KD

54:28.240 --> 54:33.160
connect but what if you used the voice dictation on the Android phone for input

54:33.160 --> 54:37.160
and then use KD connect to send it in the machine that's clever interesting

54:37.160 --> 54:40.480
but it Katie connect I'm actually a daily user of KD connect who does this

54:40.480 --> 54:45.960
oh okay oh so is this a reasonable like actual workable solution as far as

54:45.960 --> 54:50.440
transcriptions go yes it actually works quite well because it'll mimic a

54:50.440 --> 54:55.000
keyboard like if you set your key to remote input with your KD connect from

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
your phone you can use it as a mouse or a keyboard so it uses whatever your

54:58.000 --> 55:03.400
keyboard is to input the content to through KD connect to your computer so

55:03.400 --> 55:07.720
anything you send through your keyboard will go to through KD connect to your

55:07.720 --> 55:13.160
computer so you can have a keyboard that has voice built into it and the voice

55:13.160 --> 55:18.560
dictation if it's good we'll send it to your computer and it works great but it

55:18.560 --> 55:26.520
requires a really good voice dictation and keyboard integration so I use swipe

55:26.520 --> 55:32.000
because it has dragon dictation built into it oh okay yeah dragon is good

55:32.000 --> 55:37.720
stuff the company who makes dragon bolt swipe nuance so they're both they're

55:37.720 --> 55:42.760
integrated together now and it's it works so well because you can just

55:42.760 --> 55:47.320
because dragon is so efficient you just say whatever you want and it sends it in

55:47.320 --> 55:51.360
this doesn't solve his problem out like management through voice but it does

55:51.360 --> 55:57.760
solve the dictation and I use it not all the time but I use KD connect input

55:57.760 --> 56:01.520
every day and I probably do the dictation when I'm doing like a long

56:01.520 --> 56:05.040
email or something so that's a good tip about swipe so if I grab the swipe

56:05.040 --> 56:09.640
keyboard I get to use nuances dictation engine that's yep not always that nice

56:09.640 --> 56:15.320
like people who use OS X for kind of exactly that iOS also I iOS iOS voice

56:15.320 --> 56:20.280
dictation is licensed by nuances driven by nuance so they like Apple Apple just

56:20.280 --> 56:24.040
forwards that onto nuance and they do the processing so but the other nice

56:24.040 --> 56:26.440
thing about it means you're not sending your voice to Google which is kind of a

56:26.440 --> 56:28.840
means you could still get voice dictation on Android without having to

56:28.840 --> 56:32.400
send it off to Google so that's that's that's a nice way to kind of get around

56:32.400 --> 56:36.520
that I saw the I saw that producer Michael you also jumped in the in the

56:36.520 --> 56:40.280
comments to help that guy out yeah I basically explained similar something

56:40.280 --> 56:44.280
similar like a quick way like a you know this is how it works with me but I didn't

56:44.280 --> 56:49.840
really go into detail but yeah it is a lot better than the basic Google voice

56:49.840 --> 56:54.240
dictation and I think I think swipe is a better keyboard in general but the the

56:54.240 --> 56:59.240
dragon dictation built into it is way way better and it's a lot it's very

56:59.240 --> 57:02.840
smooth for this and the fact that Katie connect works on all de's and it's just

57:02.840 --> 57:08.280
it's made by the Katie project but it's not specific to Katie plasma this is a

57:08.280 --> 57:13.880
great solution pretty much for all Linux users the other thing that is sort of a

57:13.880 --> 57:18.200
long-term looking up kind of thing is and like I said earlier we've been

57:18.200 --> 57:21.800
covering it on Linux action news a couple of times is Mozilla's voice

57:21.800 --> 57:26.360
project common voice and they're working on if you go to voice dot Mozilla org

57:26.360 --> 57:30.040
they're working on essentially creating a common standard for this architect in

57:30.040 --> 57:36.160
the chat room also says that BSD now has talked a bit about using I forget orca

57:36.160 --> 57:40.400
he said so BSD now is covered orca a bit it's the reverse it's not a control

57:40.400 --> 57:43.640
it's a reader yeah right it yeah the right it's a screen reader right orca

57:43.640 --> 57:47.160
the screen reader but I guess that would be the other the opposite side is if

57:47.160 --> 57:51.440
that's something you want to try anyways if you guys have any suggestions I have

57:51.440 --> 57:56.720
a new way perhaps for you to get those suggestions into the show are you ready

57:56.720 --> 58:02.080
for this no so Jupiter broadcasting is crazy pants sometimes I swear I swear

58:02.080 --> 58:05.760
sometimes we just sit around and then boom all of a sudden it's total chaos

58:05.760 --> 58:11.680
right now one of those moments is upon us it is we are trying out a new

58:11.680 --> 58:17.280
platform to let me guess let me guess the US Postal Service I know I'm

58:17.280 --> 58:20.080
couching this a lot aren't I like I'm really building up here that you're

58:20.080 --> 58:23.720
right yeah I'm the USB up postcards everybody can we at least use FedEx I

58:23.720 --> 58:28.120
think postcards would be pretty bad yes is a lot more efficient for me I also

58:28.120 --> 58:31.720
think postcards would be great and you know if you look at how much a postcard

58:31.720 --> 58:36.040
or a stamp cost it's way cheaper than using FedEx what about carrier pigeons

58:36.040 --> 58:40.480
or carrier drones we could be hip mm-hmm there's a lot of different things we're

58:40.480 --> 58:45.840
looking at these days but we are beta testing a sort of community

58:45.840 --> 58:49.680
consolidation platform called discord that's how I'm looking at it and it's

58:49.680 --> 58:52.640
one that we've had up on the chat room on and off we've had that chat room up

58:52.640 --> 58:57.040
on the screen on and off of it combines several features and one of which is I

58:57.040 --> 59:02.760
personally face a problem today and I'll just we'll just take a moment go to

59:02.760 --> 59:07.080
Chris's corner here and that and that problem is that there are many a

59:07.080 --> 59:12.400
platforms that folk can reach me on that I'm gonna just this off top my head so

59:12.400 --> 59:15.960
I'll probably get the wrong but of course there's Twitter there's email

59:15.960 --> 59:23.040
there is telegram there are is reddit messages there are Facebook messages of

59:23.040 --> 59:26.480
course there's also Twitter DMS which I consider separate than at mentions

59:26.480 --> 59:29.920
mm-hmm there's the IRC room what am I forgetting

59:29.920 --> 59:32.720
Rekha I'm forgetting a couple of things but I think I'm making my point you say

59:32.720 --> 59:36.320
telegram yeah I'm making my point like there and that is I would say those are

59:36.320 --> 59:42.400
the daily platforms that people use and expect me to reply to them and it's just

59:42.400 --> 59:49.520
sort of crazy it's a bit of a message octopus yeah and so oh thanks yeah I kind

59:49.520 --> 59:52.240
of stopped checking it but Google plus yes you're right it is one of them since

59:52.240 --> 59:55.520
I've started hosting shows I'm starting to feel some of this like I've been

59:55.520 --> 59:59.520
getting reddit messages and Twitter DMS and yeah so you know that X KCD comic

59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.640
about how there's too many standards so we need to create a new standard we're

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.720
creating a new standard yeah that's kind of what we're beta testing right now and

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:11.800
the idea is to sort of funnel it all into discord perhaps using bridges to

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.880
help people like so if you're an IR if you prefer to use IRC but you still

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.880
want to be in the conversation we could use either use work we're looking at

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:23.480
different systems bridges bots front ends all these different ways to make it

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:27.400
happen and essentially create a mega chat we could even integrate with

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:32.840
telegram so we could have a jblive.tv telegram group that can be like and

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:36.000
matrix yeah so you could have like you if you're a tele like a lot of people

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.320
just like to hang out on telegram we could just have a dedicated group we

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.480
wouldn't use the existing one but we'd have a dedicated group that would just

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.680
be if you're in here you're part of the live chat so you can participate from

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.480
different locations so we're looking at ways to consolidate and make a mega chat

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:54.600
and as part of that I'm testing discord right now we've launched it to our

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.440
patrons they've been beta test or alpha testing it for us really for like what a

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.640
week it's been about a week in a week in a day or so we've got a lot of people in

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:07.160
there and so now we're opening it up to the wider community to help test a

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:10.160
specific feature I mean you can test all of it but the feature that I'd like to

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:15.840
test is consolidation of feedback and I've launched a dedicated channel called

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.720
haircare and when you join haircare it is a place for you to have a direct line

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:25.240
of communication with me directly this is a room where you can share a show

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:29.060
idea you can air a complaint or a concern you can just give general

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:33.520
feedback you can say thanks whatever you want I just like it to be tight specific

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:38.360
and on topic and if you say like hey review more applications that's what

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.120
Eric did great piece of feedback there as like okay my first thought was well

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:45.960
which application so you know be specific but this is this is a spot where

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:50.540
at least for a while I'll be watching this very closely and if you if there's

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.920
something you want to get in front of my face this is the spot I'm gonna try to

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.340
it I'm gonna try to suggest everybody go to as a way to help beta test this as a

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:02.720
platform to see if it works for our community if you're curious about some

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.920
of our motivations about why we're trying this if you want to hear both

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:09.320
sides of that debate check out recent episodes a user where we've been

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:14.240
discussing the philosophical side of this and the community impact side of

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:21.120
this so I have a question for you sir hair care is that specific to Chris

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:25.320
last feedback it's like well what I was thinking was like say you wanted to

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:30.320
write a letter to the CEO and it's like something I mean I don't know I guess we

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:33.440
could anybody could probably anybody in the staff could probably respond I was

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.240
just wondering if I need to create a beard channel to get beard feet bad you

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:42.120
could you could yeah yeah I was thinking to be like it's not I mean you could

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:45.080
give me specific feedback about some of the obnoxious stupid things and tics

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:50.360
that I have that's fine yeah but I would I was really like is like I wanted to

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.760
let the CEO of the company know here's a problem or here's an idea or here's

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:57.160
something I love or here's something they need to do more of and you can drop

01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:00.640
in there and at least while we're testing this and of course while there's

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.640
not as very many people in there you're definitely gonna have my attention we I

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:06.720
don't plan to be in there all the time I'm gonna check it in batches yeah we do

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:11.400
also have a content corner channel where you can share stuff like stuff that you

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.440
want to see on shows yeah so the car I was thinking the difference there the

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:19.120
content corner might be more like here's an idea I have and let's bang this out

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.360
so like I'd like to see more application reviews was Eric's idea so if you go in

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.560
the car so if Eric were to go on the content channel with that he could say

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.320
I'd like to see more application reviews what kind of applications do you think

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:33.400
JB should talk about like what are what are applications that need covered and

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.120
then that that would really kind of be useful for us to see like that to that

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:40.260
conversation that discussion and see where you and then you know when

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:43.280
somebody has a really poignant on the on the nose idea they can drop into hair

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:50.600
care and get in front of my face also something I haven't decided on should we

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:56.000
have like separate channels for each show in the discord I don't know I feel

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.720
like some shows like on filter probably should yeah I feel like we should ask

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.020
the community yeah so that could be something we talk about in general so

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:05.840
how do they get there that's probably a good question that's probably something

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:10.240
we should have said by now that would be discord dot me slash Jupiter colony nice

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.520
yeah we're calling it the Jupiter colony so you can join our colony if you're a

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.440
patron to go through patreon and turn on your discord part you'll get special

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:22.520
status in the discord system and I don't know if it's on automatically I like

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:25.760
like people have to go claim that perk you know in the in the patreon area

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.760
patreon the patreon bot does automatically oh it does okay you you do

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.100
have to connect your discord on the patreon side though okay yeah okay yeah

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:38.120
you manually naked to and then the bot gives you role and I did notice one

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:44.300
thing people that are donating but aren't on a specific tier won't get

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:48.680
connected so you have to be on one of the tiers ah that's that's interesting

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:52.120
so like if you're doing like say like if you do like two dollars and 25 cents

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:56.320
yeah that's not a tier level so it doesn't work with the yeah but if you if

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:01.480
you bump it up to like three dollar tier then yeah yeah we also you know we also

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:06.400
while we're talking about that the Jupiter signal patreon which plug plug

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:09.440
plug is a great way to support the network we also Beard and I released a

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:13.380
podcast exclusive to our patrons yep that talks about some of this too we've

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:17.840
been really this is something we've been really thinking about a lot because

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:23.080
there's obvious disadvantages to discord and the biggest one is the fact that it

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:28.480
is not open source and it is not self hosted and so that's the one where we've

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:33.800
had the most reflection and conversation around and I I'm not gonna repeat it all

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:37.500
here so that's in the other shows if you care but do know that it's something we

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:41.880
were giving a tremendous amount of thought to to the detriment of other

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:45.040
things we maybe should be thinking about to the detriment I should say much like

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:50.160
firebox yeah but it's all in the beta stage we have it we're not making any

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.960
changes we're not replacing anything right now it's all in the beta stages

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:55.960
and this is cool though they use Linux for the hosting they make a Linux

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:59.960
client available they use opus for the codec web RTC and all that kind of stuff

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:03.360
it's it's pretty nice and it works at different scales it works for large

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:06.120
communities or just for my kids to have like a little spot for them to chat on

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:10.720
their own server so yeah there you have it you can go to what was that URL again

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.960
there I'll be what was it it was a discord.me discord.me slash Jupiter

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:19.240
colony magic discord.me slash Jupiter colony and we will have a link in the

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:23.400
show notes too what do you think Wes because you know I know you you you like

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:26.920
your tools to be open source I do I know that's especially like the platform

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.880
level I know that's important to you but I also know that as a practical man

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:36.160
who's in the day-to-day like workforce you're also in slack quite a bit so you

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:40.640
this is something you've probably dealt with at that level like do I use you

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.360
know using slack and using it with different systems versus IRC what do you

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.440
think about this stuff what do you do you consider these tools to be precious

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:51.400
and that these cut discord and and instead of slack if possibly should be

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:55.760
using matter most instead of discord maybe be using matrix like is that how

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:59.400
much weight do you give to that debate I'm glad it's considered I mean it is

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:04.160
it is important I would prefer to use you know as much open source bot

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:09.040
platforms as possible but so many of these things you end up you know it's

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:11.360
just as like how many users do you have do you have the people that you want to

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.960
talk to you on the platform that you that is available and I also understand

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:18.600
your perspective in that like yeah between slack and telegram and all the

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.840
other things it can be you know there's a lot it's hard to keep track of and

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:26.040
it's hard to use right well well we've had a fragmentation of the community

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:32.280
between reddit IRC telegram and people who just you know are maybe occasionally

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:36.240
write in on email it's it's really spread out so it's attractive to

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:39.240
consider something that has the capability to bridge all these different

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:43.360
networks and mumble to and bridge it all together into one space that's pretty

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:49.120
attractive and then it has the feature set to spin up voice chats so that could

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:53.200
be very useful as right and that's what it's quite quite featureful and I think

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.760
one thing that like like slack at least you know for my day job and other things

01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:00.160
that had advantage over the other clients that we'd already been using for

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:03.400
chat was just like you know first-class platform support first-class mobile

01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:08.160
support quassel droid on the phone is not bad but it's not really it's not

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.760
really the same it hasn't been designed with that sort of use case or

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:15.360
interactivity so there's also I think would make it easier plus I've never

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.720
really liked telegram groups all that much I don't find them very usable I

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.960
don't use telegram for anything else like that so having I have to mute them

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:25.240
all the time and then I can't really tell if I've missed things or not I

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:30.040
don't know so yeah discarded feels like a better place to have yeah plus with

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:33.880
telegram and other things like there's already you know issues with the it

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:37.880
being hosted and that's true and really our IRC chat room is hosted on a

01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:41.320
different service so I would it's on somebody else's system it's on geek

01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:45.360
shed I do think it is imperative that we continue to build things like rocket

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:49.000
shat manner most matrix we continue to build bridges so that we can kind of you

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.160
can communicate on the platform of your choice maybe some of your communications

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:55.040
goes to a platform you don't like but you can at least control that and limit

01:08:55.040 --> 01:09:00.720
it to where you need to mm-hmm to me these platforms are not so important that

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:05.720
it needs to be something that aligns with my self-identity it these are

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:11.120
things if Spotify were to go away tomorrow I'd be fine honestly if

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:14.120
Netflix were to go away tomorrow I'd be fine Amazon Prime streaming goes away

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.960
tomorrow I'd be fine Steam shuts down I'd be a little butt

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:21.600
hurt but if they gave me a way to keep my games offline I'd be fine I the

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:27.600
systems that I choose to participate in that are hosted are systems that to me

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:35.280
don't matter in ten years I could give I could give zero shits about about you

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.280
know Spotify in five years I really don't care I don't care if they make

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:41.280
money I don't care if they make it I just don't care because to me there's

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:44.760
always something else to switch to and there's always another platform that

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.760
comes around there's always another way to do that job and so for maybe a couple

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:52.000
of years it's one system and then for another couple of years it's another

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.040
system and you know it's to be how it goes a couple years after that'll be a

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.640
different system and it's just the way it works and to me none of its really

01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:05.080
none of it really matters that you don't view it as like you know building blocks

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:08.080
it's not the foundation of your life it's just something that you kind of

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:14.040
connect into and yeah it's a thing that is providing me value for probably a

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:18.960
year or two and at some point it's likely going to stop providing me value

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:23.080
or the value proposition will be such that it provides more pain than it does

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:26.680
value and at that point I will switch to something else that's just how I see it

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:31.640
yeah I'm kind of in the same camp I do sympathize with people who use IRC all

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:36.160
the time and have been using it for the past 15 years and don't have that same

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.800
experience of hopping between clients all the time but I'm definitely in your

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:46.760
camp hmm I think discord is is is fantastic the only problem it has is the

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:50.320
proprietary hosting part yeah but there's a lot of features that's great

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:54.240
like especially the web hook system is fantastic can you explain that to me I

01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:58.720
don't really understand web hooks does I saw it in the settings it's kind of

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.640
like its own bot built into the system so like if you can you can make it where

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.600
when you post something on Twitter it'll use a web hook to send it into the chat

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:11.120
room oh yeah I also saw like it you can use it with github so like if a project

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:15.560
doesn't yeah yeah essentially that's third-party services push notifications

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:21.160
to your discord right but you can also build your own webbook using like you

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:25.320
can even use like if this and that send using anything from there yeah into

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:30.760
discord that's interesting but it's basically to push information to you

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:33.980
this conversations like it would be this feels like this conversation to be

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:39.760
totally reframed if Jupiter broadcasting ran their own IRC server you know you

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:46.760
but like this we this this this problem I for me as a Linux user I don't know

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:53.480
where to draw the line here's where my my my my confusion comes in

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:59.320
if this is a line I were to hold say say I were to just reject discord out of

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:04.440
hand for Jupiter broadcasting simply because it is not open source the hosted

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:09.040
part of it then where do I draw that line do I say

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:13.880
well we can no longer use Android devices either because they're Linux but

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:17.640
they have a proprietary layer on on top of them do I say the same thing about

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.600
routers what about what about our edge routers like where do I draw that okay

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:26.240
go ahead yeah where do I draw that line I think the difference is what when

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.800
you're talking about using discord you're asking other people to cross the

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:35.120
line whereas what you're when you're saying what you're using inside your

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:38.800
studio nobody gives a toss what you're using in your studio sure but what you

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:42.640
when you're asking me to sign up for a service that's when it changes well

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:46.440
first of all that's not true because plenty of people care about what we use

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:51.480
in our studio probably too much but aside from that then then we should we

01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:55.000
should we should also not be on telegram we shouldn't be on Twitter we

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.960
shouldn't be on reddit because we're not hosting that ourselves we shouldn't be

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:03.160
on any of these services I do agree yes so where if you're gonna draw the line

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:08.320
draw the line so I know poppy yeah I know you are in there so you use it you

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.720
all I think you probably have slacks that you're in as well I know you

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.560
probably use things like hangouts how where this is always a debate us Linux

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:18.080
users are having when do you choose a proprietary solution over the free one

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:21.840
what about you personally I'm a pragmatic person so I have an Nvidia

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:25.920
binary driver installed I have steam I have hundred steam game stored on my

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:30.120
laptop but I'm not inconveniencing anyone else by doing that I'm not I'm

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.000
not causing someone else to have to install non free software in order to

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.640
interact with you if you want to talk with me on a free software platform you

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:42.920
can do that right so be okay so are you saying so the key then is to leave the

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:46.640
leave a way for people to communicate that is an open and free platform still

01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:49.920
so like right could be on slack you can be on discord but there's got to still

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:53.720
be a way if you don't want to participate in any of that stuff exactly

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.080
that would be a reasonable thing I think that's pretty easy to do with an IRC

01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:01.120
bridge where it could be really tricky is there's no bridge for mumble so if we

01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:05.320
I don't know if we'd ever replace mumble but you could see the super handiness

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:10.360
where you can integrate all of it in one place and especially when you consider

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:13.680
the fact that there's patreon integration so we could say maybe these

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:18.400
members of the unfiltered patreon can be involved in a listener edition of the

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.040
show and it's just a matter of check a box and now they have those permissions

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.480
if they delete their patreon account their permissions are removed we don't

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:31.000
have to manage two systems here at JB which we would suck at that's that to me

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.960
seems like oh well shit that almost would make it worth not using mumble but

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:39.240
then there wouldn't be a free and open way unless somebody were developed so we

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:42.640
need a mumble yeah scored brick but then the flip side is one of the biggest

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:46.200
hurdles for this here podcast that you're listening to right now is hey by

01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:48.360
the way can you tell this is a summer edition we're talking about ourselves

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:54.120
this here podcast is when we bring guests on they really have often never

01:14:54.120 --> 01:15:00.000
used mumble before and so most the time I ping producer Michael and I say hey

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.480
rotten I know you're probably busy but can you reach out to XYZ and can you

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:08.880
help this guy get mumble configured and he always says yes and he's created he's

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:14.400
created documentation for it too so but you can imagine like rotten if like I we

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.640
didn't have to do that anymore if it was just go to this website login and it

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:21.280
just works I mean it's still a cat you still kind of have to explain to square

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:24.480
there we used it but it is it's simpler to set up in the sense you have to

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:27.680
worry about ports or especially like the audio settings like configuring which

01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:31.120
audio interface to use and the troubleshooting your connection is

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:35.480
really simple it depends where you are on the you know the storm in line and

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:41.600
there are certainly podcasters who won't put out their podcast even now as an mp3

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:45.120
but only as old and they use free software platforms and they have

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.960
self-hosted WordPress and you know things like that they and they only use

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:56.200
mumble and they would expect you to jump through hoops in order to be a guest on

01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:01.960
their show now you're a bit further down the line in that you're going to allow

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:06.480
people to join the show but they'd have to you know they'd have to use some

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:10.680
non-free thing and you also use non-free just for distribution of your show which

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:14.400
they wouldn't use and I guess it's just what you're personally comfortable with

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:21.920
mm-hmm okay so is it Rob brother arm is that what row brother arm is it row

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.160
brother arm is that how I was supposed to rob the RAM how about let's just go

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:30.000
with Rob Rob you said you're in another community that's having this exact

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:36.760
conversation right now are we being basic yeah it was identical not podcast

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:42.680
related but minecraft server related but yeah we used to have an IRC server that

01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:48.440
bridged into the game server and we all were IRC people and we recently moved to

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:51.660
mumble this cause because everyone else was on

01:16:51.660 --> 01:16:56.680
discord but we still have a mumble room right and the other conversation of well

01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:01.480
we've got people who already know how mobile works can easily diagnose or

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:06.320
discuss with the person how to get them into mumble it's all the

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:10.800
documentation and it's the question of do we really want to just move all the

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.960
way to right it's a bit the network of though isn't it because it's got a

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:18.600
network effect there's also like a lot of stuff built into discord by default

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:22.920
that in some cases requires the beta version of mumble to use you know one of

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:26.880
the things example controlling all volume of individual users is built into

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:30.080
discord exactly if you want to do that in mumble it requires you to have the

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:34.080
beta version not only is it built into discord but the UI to use it is simple

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.440
enough that I could do it on the fly while I'm saying these very very words

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:43.040
right now and I can adjust people without having to go up okay you know

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:47.800
so that's it that also wins to the UI not only is it great for guests but it

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:51.920
wins on tweaking volume and just one of the UI thing that's kind of nice is if

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.960
you think about it as somebody who's never been in the Jupiter broadcasting

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:59.320
community ever and they're landing here for the very first time when you open up

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:05.560
discord one of the things that I think is sort of nice and helpful is the hosts

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:09.960
are broken out and color-coded patrons are broken out and color-coded bots are

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:13.680
broken out and color-coded and people with ultimate admin power are broken

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:18.120
out and color-coded so you immediately know who's who like it it's not there's

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:23.440
not like ambiguity like who is DVL who's DVL with oh now you know oh that's Dan

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:27.360
from tech snap that's Dan oh shit that's Dan from tech snap like it's it's it's

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:31.320
more friendly in terms of just the layout and the way it looks and the way

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:34.640
people are broken out into groups it makes it understandable for somebody

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.600
who's coming to this community for the first time ever and which could be a

01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:42.920
more and more thing on discord because of that network effect proprietary

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:46.680
software being prettier than free software who yeah is this this is why

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:50.320
I'm talking about it because exactly that poppy like this is a freaking

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:56.200
classic problem that we have now it is like it is the problem of our time with

01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:00.480
hosted services and all of these sons of bitches are running on Linux they're all

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:05.480
using Linux on the back end it's really interesting because it's using Linux to

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:10.680
create services that eventually get a big enough user base that they get

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:15.080
profitable but they start with like this crazy venture funding structure they

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:19.400
have they have nitro which you can get for a discord if you want to give them

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:23.320
five bucks a month basically or four bucks a month it also announced they're

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:27.320
going to add premium plugins in the future but everything currently they've

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:31.640
stated everything currently that is free will stay free there's definitely some

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:36.000
features in there that are nice for us like there's there's integration with

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
things like OBS that are nice for us and there's there's moderating features that

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
are nice for us like one of the things that I've always kind of wanted is I'd

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.560
like to be able to review a log because a lot of times somebody comes to me and

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:49.920
they say hey so-and-so kicked me for no good reason and so this has a really

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:52.760
good auto log so I can see what's been going on just on that end of the

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:55.960
community which is something I don't generally get oversight over and so

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:58.880
that's that's pleasant but there's other things in there too about the way the

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:02.320
notification structure works it has a mode for when we're on the live stream

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:05.080
like we are right now where we can just immediately turn off all notifications

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.920
which is really nice oh and then the last thing and then we'll get off this

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:13.840
and this is again going back this is a classic for open source solution versus

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:18.160
hosted solution dynamite mobile app works great on tablets because I loaded

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:20.720
it all my kids tablets because they have a little private server with them and

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:26.840
Noah's kids and just dynamite app just really good app works well respects my

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:31.200
D&D preferences all that kind of stuff and that's always a problem like rocket

01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:35.480
chat there's several rocket chat clients there's several matter most clients none

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:39.480
of them are quite as good as slacks client and the same with the same with

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:44.780
the discord like there's there's several mumble clients for mobile not really on

01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:50.160
iOS but there's some it's like one I think and boy is it ass it really is ass

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:54.640
and of course discourse great and so one of the things that we've heard from the

01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:58.320
community and I think this is a this is something just like when open source

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:02.480
projects move to github and get lab they get more contributors when we move to

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:07.120
telegram we got more members of the community because one of the things I've

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:12.520
heard is I'm on my phone and when I have time to respond and interact I'm on my

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:16.920
phone I don't I'm not at a computer and so that's why telegram works so good for

01:21:16.920 --> 01:21:19.040
me and so we've we've heard from people on

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.720
telegram that we don't normally hear from because that's their that's their

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:26.400
that's the tool they use when they have downtime is they fire up telegram and

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.000
they chat with folks to kill a few minutes and now they're able to

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.400
participate in telegram they were never participating before in IRC or in the

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:39.960
comments or anywhere else I suppose the the main issue is how many how often do

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:43.720
we have people on mumble that are free software only well there's a good

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:49.720
portion I think I know there's a few for sure but I don't know that's the other

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:53.120
thing it's like it's like mumble is pretty stable and reliable once you have

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.080
it set up and you have a certificate and you have all that so it's kind of it's

01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:59.880
harder to justify replacing mumble yeah I feel like it does have the best audio

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:03.100
quality out of all of them too yeah I think it sounds pretty good and it's

01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:08.080
also a lot more efficient with detecting voice or not although I'll give you a

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.980
what where discord wins is I do like they're using opus but where they also

01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:16.240
in the UI department again is they give you a cellular signal like equivalent

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:20.120
you get three green bars or red bars you hover it over it tells you what your

01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:23.840
ping is you can click a little info button and you actually get like a

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:27.960
chart of your average response time of how your connections been doing it tells

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:31.040
you the ping rate to the different servers you're connected to it really

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:34.280
and it's something we've already used it in testing when we were when we were

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:36.960
troubleshooting with Noah we're like all right what are these numbers and we

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:42.080
immediately know what to expect and within I don't know 30 seconds beard

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:44.280
moved us over to an East Coast server because it's just you go up there

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:49.240
settings move to East Coast and resolve the issue wow and it was really handy

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:53.920
because it was just here's the information it was really easy for him

01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:56.160
to understand even though it's the first time he'd ever even open it or second

01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:59.800
time he'd ever even opened up discord is that kind of stuff

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:05.400
mumble doesn't do so well on but yes you get it set up making a server it says

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:08.480
what's what region do you want to put your server in stuff like that I could

01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:15.600
also see like for productions like this show sticking with mumble and then for

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:19.560
productions like a special one-off version of kota radio or on filter using

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:23.120
discord for that where it's like hey we're gonna pull in a few people and

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:27.480
we're recording a holiday episode and thought we'd have the audience join us

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:30.800
where you don't normally have a structure and you don't normally have

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:34.520
people showing up every Tuesday that might be like the more impromptu voice

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.880
shows maybe that might be discord sorry what were you gonna say Michael I was

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:43.000
just I think mumble is a great software it's just it's the the luxuries that

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:49.080
discord provides is what makes look discord the current market share of most

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:54.160
most communities that are voice based kind of stuff like even teamspeak is

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:57.240
losing a lot of its market share to discord yeah it's growing it's growing

01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:00.260
crazy because it's it's you know a lot of things that people been building

01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:03.360
different systems to do in one you know I just thought of one thing that mumble

01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:07.840
does that discord doesn't that is critical to the show I don't think

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:13.320
discord can do sub a voice channels like mumble does where we have like now the

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:20.080
on-air channel like the mic check yeah but it does it does do UI I guess we

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:24.040
could have like we could have different rooms but it does do it does do UI

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:26.800
feedback like if you don't have any mic level coming in and stuff like that so

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:30.720
it does walk the user through resolving the only limitation that based on that

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:33.900
point the only limitation of not being able to sub the ACLs and mumble allow

01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:36.880
you to be inside the join queue and still listen to the show while you're

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:40.960
waiting whereas in discord you wouldn't be able to hear anything yeah see I

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:44.160
think maybe we would keep mumble for unplugged yep and then discord would be

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.960
like all right well in 15 minutes we're gonna have we're gonna have a show where

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:51.680
we want the audience we get like 10 15 people all of a sudden that might be

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:56.480
yeah yeah cuz really it's it's such it's just solid software once you get it set

01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:59.920
up and you know we've got the mumble server hone on digital ocean so it's and

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:03.880
the the ping times ridiculously low for the studio it's like we have like a 36

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:07.800
ping it's just wonderful we also should probably create an announcements channel

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:11.320
so we can do like at everyone and just they'll get a push notification on their

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:16.240
phone when we're like live or something oh so like do people leave the

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:19.440
notifications turned on is that something people do I do actually if

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:22.560
you're a big if you're there's a suggestion by the discord team if you're

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:27.120
a big server you should not even do that you should server-wide turn off

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:31.440
notifications I look except for at mentions because there's times where

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:36.240
people will jump in and the more people you get the more annoying it is to never

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:40.320
use discord before so you're kind of like preemptively doing that for them

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:46.920
well the idea would be to have a channel that only we could post in yeah only mods

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:51.280
and whatever has the role to do it and then at everyone is a is a mention to

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:55.340
anyone oh yeah that's right yeah and the other way it's set up currently you can

01:25:55.340 --> 01:26:00.280
also you can at mention like you can't mention groups so like yeah this is

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.880
something we're just gonna play with and you know right now we've got just a

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:06.400
handful of people in there because we've just been experimenting we like I said

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:09.520
earlier we launched with our patrons first and then sort of scale it out

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:13.040
scale it oh man we got to go geez oh okay so we got to talk about the slack

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.800
where challenge and then we'll then we'll then we'll scoot linux academy

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.740
comm slash unplugged go there to support the show and sign up for a free seven

01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:25.000
day trial it's a platform built by Linux lovers for Linux users and lovers

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.760
like us Linux Academy comm slash unplugged sports show and seven-day free

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:33.880
trial go there try it out and sign up and check out their self-paced in-depth

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:38.280
video courses on every dang Linux cloud and DevOps topic and I really love the

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:42.700
hands-on labs because this is where you get scenario based stuff over an SSH

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:45.640
connection and you really know what you're working with when you go do it in

01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:49.320
production you feel like you've already done it before and if you ever get stuck

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:53.080
along your path to excellent learning they have instructor mentoring standing

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:57.280
by full-time human instructors who also love Linux and they're there to answer

01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:01.320
your questions that's that's such a deep benefit to Linux Academy and something

01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:06.720
pretty much no other platform has this that's huge also you know what else just

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:10.440
thinking about what no other platform has the community such a vibrant active

01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:13.520
community full of Jupiter broadcasting members and that's nice because there's

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:16.960
certain functionality inside Linux Academy some of the courseware that can

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:20.440
be iterated upon by the community and so when you have a good vibrant community

01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:23.480
like that it means that the contents getting better constantly and they turn

01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:26.440
that investment around into their infrastructure into their courseware and

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:30.520
into their instructors it really shows and as a Linux Academy subscriber now

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:34.240
for years I still find value out of it even when I'm just sort of toying around

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.840
with the concept it's nice to be able to go in and get a real grasp from the

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:40.560
basics all the way up to what the high-end stuff is and if you're looking

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:44.600
for certs I definitely recommend you check it out go to Linux Academy comm

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:48.880
slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:54.680
unplugged program Linux Academy comm slash unplugged slack where challenge

01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:58.520
West I think here's what I'm thinking yeah now here's okay I got to tell you

01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:01.240
what I'm thinking are you ready for what I'm thinking here's what I'm thinking by

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.960
the way what do you think I'm thinking I'm gonna put it on one machine after

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.520
this episode I've already got the ISO downloadable you're ahead of me yeah

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:11.120
well I you know I had I had an inside scoop thing I kind of knew it was

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:15.760
coming and I'm going to I can't commit to switching to it immediately because I

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:20.560
have unfiltered tomorrow which requires like my whole rig but I will put it on

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:26.360
my XPS 13 which I've recently been trying different distros on and I'll

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:32.600
run it starting Thursday full-time I believe I'll be able to run it full-time

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:36.440
so I'll work on it tonight and tomorrow to kind of get it like get it loaded up

01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:39.920
so by Thursday I'll be running it full-time and I'll try to report back

01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:43.480
and share my experiences what it was like to install some basic tools we'll

01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:46.600
see we'll see how far I get maybe I'll get all suddenly like I'm not using this

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:52.240
full-time I may bail I may bail in the pursuit in the in the pursuit of other

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:54.520
tasks they may have to be is there anything you're really excited about

01:28:54.520 --> 01:29:00.720
though well it's as soon as I saw the website it really it got me a little

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:05.760
nostalgic so there was that that that sort of took me back a bit and then I I

01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:11.040
almost went and just decided to put this off a week and order the six CD set oh

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:15.880
that would be fun yeah and get like a actual like package but then I realized

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:21.840
that none of my systems none of my systems have a CD rom you have to send

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:26.720
them off to a kind of viewer who will convert those USB you'll grab like the

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:29.800
extra like USB one that we have floating around here somewhere so I just

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:33.680
downloaded the torrent but I was kind of excited so that felt old-school and one

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:38.120
of the things that's really kind of fun is it also makes me feel nostalgic is

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:42.680
you can download the individual disks so like you used to have to do you can

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:47.600
download disk 1 disk 2 disk 3 disk 4 disk 5 and disk 6 if you want the source

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:51.680
code you don't need to six and so you know during the install it would be

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:56.440
ejecting the disk and asking for the next disk I miss that so much I would

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.880
never actually want to do anymore but I'd like the one chance to do it again

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:03.860
so I was tempted but then realized that I don't even have the capability so

01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:08.080
instead I grabbed the quote-unquote DVD ISO which I will never be burning to

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:12.040
a DVD but it's cute that they call it that which includes everything except of

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:18.320
course the source code yeah yeah and I'll be putting that on my xps 13 now

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:23.680
this is the I I did not intend to I guess I could change it but I did

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:27.080
accidentally grab the 32-bit version and I thought well maybe I'll just go with

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:30.000
that like I'll just be old-school I'll embrace it but you know you could get

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.560
spin up and doing an install on a virtual machine and then have your like

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:39.520
CD switching out fun yeah yeah so if you want to join me in this journey I say

01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:43.240
what I was thinking is if I can't run it as my full-time desktop what I'm gonna

01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:47.160
at least try to do is set it up for one specific task and do that job or do that

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:50.600
have you decided what desktop you're gonna run no no I mean I was probably

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:55.640
gonna go KDE but I really hadn't given it we'll find out what would you do what

01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:59.640
are you gonna do I really don't like old gnome I really don't like old gnome

01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:04.960
although you go too old on KDE plasma and I'm not I don't know did you say

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:10.720
plasma is the best yes you're right yeah even old plasma even old plasma well

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:14.280
wait wait wait are you saying that it's like we're only asking you for I don't

01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:19.320
actually remember I don't ask a for then a Monte sounds good where do I go here

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:22.800
oh yeah Monte would work yeah you're right I was actually a Joe would

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:25.120
probably love to hear this I was actually thinking XFCE but then the

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:30.120
issue is and here's why this could already be bad is that damn XPS 13 is

01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:34.560
high dpi oh so what is slack we're gonna do when I put it on a high dpi machine

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:37.840
what it's like we're gonna do I mean I've got to go with the more modern I've

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:43.960
got to so I got I hope that it's using a current version of plasma anyways I wish

01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:47.520
I could say more I wish we had more time but we really should get going to make

01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:50.760
room for the tech snap guys join us live next week won't you it's a lot of fun

about the Americans that want an Intraware though I don't think they're

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:15.320
screwed yeah right for the right to IRC oh geez that's funny discord not

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:19.400
ethical the only problem is that will create a that will create a movement to

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:23.200
save IRC yeah reality is a service dragging the line the Stallman line

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:28.480
that's not bad the Stallman lines not bad have we used that before anybody

01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:33.420
want to double check on them maximum maximum electrolysis was mine but now in

01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:38.520
retrospect not as good as the Stallman line Chris switches to PSD you try an

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:43.960
architect dude you could you could put a picture of Stallman's face over that one

01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:53.560
scene in first contact with the card so it turns out alien pastures from

01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:58.640
slackbook says that plasma 5 does work on slackware cool I'll find out we go I

01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:03.720
will find out so fight for the right to IRC is up there cut the discord discord

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:07.720
not ethical and the Stallman line really the Stallman lines not getting more love

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:11.520
like we talked because it's not just about discord it's about like this is a

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:16.000
common problem now and open this is this is it used to be like Linux or Windows

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.400
it's not that shit anymore it's this now this is what it is we're using our

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.400
proprietary we use Linux phones with proprietary apps to connect to

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:27.400
proprietary services running on Linux and we didn't even get into the fact

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:31.200
that it's also it touches on the electron electron debate too you didn't

01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:35.560
even get a fun little nugget for next week yeah I'm kind of a fan of the the

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:40.040
title reality as a service reality the service is good too I'll give it a boat

01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:45.040
I'll give it a boat the also the IRC thing is there's really no reason to be

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:49.800
for people to like like save IRC IRC wouldn't die because the only issue

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:53.600
would be mumble is the situation because IRC has a bridge so you could continue

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:57.360
to use IRC and be indirectly connected to them a discord chat yeah yeah yeah

01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:01.120
that's true well I'm told that Stallman lines moving up now that I gave it some

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:06.600
nice promotion I'm told that bridges are tacky and are only used by Minecraft

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:12.800
servers oh never be used for IRC tacky huh we are wrong so I did see someone

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:18.200
had had written a very minimal JavaScript app to forward messages between discord

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:22.240
and mumble they said there's no reason it shouldn't be able to work so if

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:25.480
anyone wants a project seems like a voice I've actually seen I know of a bot

01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:31.280
I'm working on with the intergos channel team we're doing we have telegram matrix

01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:35.280
and IRC all connected and working on adding discord into it too you should

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:43.120
look at working with the what was it the the matter something project most no

01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:51.080
hang on I gotta look it up now Oh beard paying the matrix bridge is the most

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:58.360
impressive bridge I've seen for IRC because it it makes IRC users like react

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:03.440
exactly like a matrix user in the matrix check chat and also vice-versa so like

01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:09.120
you have a full both you have a full power of both sides from either side hey

01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:13.480
Rekha you remember what episode we announced the winner of the XPS 13 mmm

01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:18.840
yeah his name was Michael to now I think it was the one previous to the last one

01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:25.800
number 18 yeah Rekha tricked you because he didn't put it in the time so a lot of

01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:27.960
people been like I listen to that episode I haven't heard it and it's like

01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:31.200
ah you didn't you just looked at the timecode that's what you did all right

01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:34.160
we got a we got a run because the tech snap guys got a start but I think let's

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:38.000
go check our winner is the Stallman line which I think is a good solid title so

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.360
