1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So Dan, how's it working now?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I think it's working.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You sound awesome.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Good job. Well done, sir.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Are you using that newfangled elementary OS I've heard so much about?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay, so I was

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
on the experimental

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
artful build that is super

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
unstable, and so every time I opened

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Mumble, it would just destroy my session.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It would just crash. Oh, man.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, dear. Yeah, so I came back to stable

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and everything works.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So is that a yes?

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm glad we sorted that.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'd just like to point out

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
one week away from release, and I'm using

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Ubuntu Mate 17.10. Oh, boom!

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's fine.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Linux Unplugged, episode 218

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:00,000
for Tuesday, October 10th, 2017.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Linux talk show that's been carrying around

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
multiple laptops for weeks.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. And hello,

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Beardsley. Hey, how's it going?

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So guys, we have a pretty great show today.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Finally gonna get

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
to sit down and review the

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Librem 15, the latest

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and greatest from Purism,

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
which kind of the timing's sort of

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
perfect, because also

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
there's some big news around the funding for Librem 5.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So we'll be taking a look at one

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
of their products that initially was a crowd

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
funder at just the moment

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
that the Librem 5 hit its crowdfunding

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
goal. Very interesting to see where something

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
like this they've worked on a couple years, where are they at?

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How far did they get if they had a couple years to work

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
on something? Also,

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
really, really big community news

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
that I want to cover this week, and we're gonna

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
roll out an experimental new segment as

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
part of that community news. Controversial,

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
the beard tells me. Prepare to be

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
flamed, the beard warns me.

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Didn't you? He did. I did.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So we will roll out a new corner

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
of the show this week to talk

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
about something that's here, it's real,

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and we're all dealing with it.

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And it's spelled with a lowercase d. That'll

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
be coming up in a little bit. And then

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
after all of that, if

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
time permits,

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
this show is in a special moment

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
right now. It is

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
32 episodes away from

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
250. And why

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
do you say that matters? Why does that matter? Is that what you might be wondering?

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why does that matter, right? Isn't that just a number?

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah, well it is, and I couldn't wait till 300,

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
that's why it mattered. So 250

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
is just 32 episodes

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
away, and it is time

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
for

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
some changes. We're switching

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
to Haiku. Boom.

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So if you're a fan of this show, following

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
the show for a while, I encourage you to stick around towards

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
the end of the show. We'll talk a little bit

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
about some of the changes that could be coming down the road

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
around 250, around

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
episode 250, so we'll give you a long time

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
to digest it all. But never fear,

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I think it's all for the better.

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Before we go any further, we gotta cover some community

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
news, and there is one order of business

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
that we must take care of before we go there.

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And that's bringing in our virtual

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
log. Time appropriate greetings!

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Mamba room! Hello!

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Hello!

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Well I'm like William Shatner getting thrown

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
across his bridge right now with that one.

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We got some excited people. They're fired up and ready

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
to go. There you go. I'll tell you what I'm fired

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
up about. One of the projects

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
that has one of the worst names in recent history

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
but is so damn useful, FW

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Update.

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Firmware update, FWupd, just hit

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
version 1.0. Now this is

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that special little bit of magic

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
that's a lot of good software

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
but also a lot of really great

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
partnerships and relationships

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
that have resulted in Linux

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
users getting firmware

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
updates to critical pieces of hardware in their

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
machine via software updates

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
like any

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
modern desktop system does in 2017.

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And they just hit version

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
1.0. Since they've

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
started the project, they've basically re-architected

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the way the entire daemon works. They've re-imagined

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
how the metadata is downloaded and managed.

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
They've changed core ways of the way

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
things themselves are done with the upgrades.

115
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
They now support 72 different kinds of

116
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
hardware with support for another

117
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
dozen or so currently being worked

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
on. And lots

119
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
of vendors are now using the LVFS

120
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
project to distribute firmware.

121
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now LVFS project stands for

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
the Linux Vendor Firmware Project.

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Every month

124
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
165,000 plus

125
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
devices get updated using

126
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
FWupdate.

127
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now that is some good progress.

128
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, yeah. Del, as you

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
might know if you've followed some of our coverage here

130
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
on this network, has been a huge supporter, they write,

131
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
since the early days. Now smaller

132
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
companies like Logitech are also supporting the

133
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
project. And he also gives a shout out to his

134
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
employer Red Hat who's given him the

135
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
resources and infrastructure and some of the

136
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
political handshaking that

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
has been needed that he said literally no one else would have given

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
him. And he's extremely grateful.

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So this is huge.

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This is one of those little bits of software

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
that doesn't have a really flashy name.

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You know, if this was something that like Max didn't

143
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
have and then all of a sudden

144
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
they got this feature, they would give

145
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
it some sort of great name like

146
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Active Firmware Updates or something. Like it would have

147
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
some sort of publicity name and

148
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
it would be a feature in the OS that this

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
version of the OS finally supports.

150
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But in Linux land,

151
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
it just slowly gets rolled out

152
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and one day when you're on a Linux machine

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and you're on Gnome Software Center

154
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and you go to updates, you see there's a firmware update.

155
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And you click it and you just installed your firmware update

156
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and you don't think about the fact that you didn't have

157
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
to go download an exe from their horrible

158
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
driver's website. You didn't have to go find

159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
some weird version of FreeDOS or something like that.

160
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Like it just worked.

161
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And that's why this project's so great.

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And it's really great to see them hit version 1.0.

163
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And there's a lot of devices on that

164
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
list. You should go check. Tons of Dell things.

165
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The Color Hug, the Logitech Unifying

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Receiver, which a lot of people probably use.

167
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Like that's awesome. I'm hopeful

168
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
that Dell gets support for this

169
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
on some of their servers at some point because I think that would

170
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
be handy. Sure, there's usually like

171
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
TMI or other ways to do it, but it'd be awesome to be able to do it

172
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
just from your regular old

173
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
operating system. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So I have a segment that I want to

175
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
roll out. A corner, if you will. It's for people who like

176
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
to mess with computers. Now I'm going to call this

177
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
the System D Corner and

178
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
the value of this is negative.

179
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I apologize if you're not a System D

180
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
fan. I understand. It is a bit

181
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
of a complex beast.

182
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But it is the reality in which we

183
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
find ourselves today. And there have been some

184
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
interesting developments in System D land.

185
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And I thought since most of us are going to be

186
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
running a version of Linux that uses it,

187
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
maybe we should know what those things are.

188
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So we now dive

189
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
into the complex and

190
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
inspired world of System D.

191
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And there's some new features, Wes.

192
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
There's some really nice new features. I

193
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
highlighted a few. Like one I thought that was

194
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
particularly neat was

195
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
dynamic users,

196
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
which is coming to System D 2.35.

197
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And you can now configure

198
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
System D to dynamically allocate

199
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Unix user IDs for service

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
processes when they start.

201
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And then they release the user ID

202
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
when it stops them. It's pretty secure and it mixes well

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
with transient services. It works with

204
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
socket activated services and

205
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
with service templating.

206
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So instead of having to have user accounts sitting

207
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
around that could be exploited, user accounts

208
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
created. The UID that is

209
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
necessary is created. When the service

210
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
is done, it's destroyed. The other part I like about this

211
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
is not necessarily just the dynamic users

212
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
thing, but they talk a lot about the methods

213
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
that you have available with System D, like

214
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
it runs as a dynamic user and then you can

215
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
pick and choose either temporary or permanent

216
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
places on the file system to give it write access

217
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
to. And it won't be able to write outside of that,

218
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
which there's a ton of things I can think like, you know,

219
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
much like snaps do in some ways where you're just like

220
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
you need to save your data in your

221
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
spot. I will go fetch it when I need it.

222
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't touch anything else in my home.

223
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Now there's something else that they've

224
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
added that I didn't really think about until

225
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I saw it as a feature and I'm like, oh, geez, I can't believe we

226
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
didn't have this. So System D analyzes

227
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
gain new verbs like get log level

228
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and get log target,

229
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
which will print the logging level

230
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and the target of the system manager,

231
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
which is if you think about what they're saying

232
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
here is now you can ask the system what

233
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
level in which are you logging at?

234
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
And you could not ask the system that before

235
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
this necessarily, but more so

236
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
than that, they're going to be able to expose this

237
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
to like GNOME logs up in the GUI

238
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
level. So you'll be able to open up your local desktop

239
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
log manager and see

240
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
your system is currently

241
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
logging at this level right now, which

242
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
that is kind of like one of those

243
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm surprised we didn't have those features.

244
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And then here's another one in that category

245
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
for each service unit

246
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
for each time a service is restarted

247
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
there'll be a counter that is now

248
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
kept so you can keep track of

249
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
how often the service restarts. It's

250
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
increased each time the service is restarted

251
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and you'll be able to

252
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
query like systemctl show

253
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
dash P number of restarts for

254
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
service X and you can see if your

255
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
nginx daemon is restarting

256
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
constantly and you get an idea of how many times that's

257
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
happened, which I think is just going to be really great

258
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
information. Then last

259
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
but not least, before we get out of the corner

260
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
you notice a little something

261
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
about kind of a clever way

262
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
that systemd murders people's system

263
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
processes and

264
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
murders them good. It really does

265
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
because it does it in a way where they don't make

266
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
a big fuss and then it can just go

267
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
and clean house after that because

268
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
and so

269
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't mean I don't want to steal your thunder because you

270
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
found this one but I thought

271
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
this is pretty great the way they I guess they use sig stop

272
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
before a real signal completely

273
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
before it gets any other signals the

274
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
process gets any other signals that would prevent it

275
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
from closing like so before it can lock up

276
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
because it got another signal they sent it a sig

277
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
stop. The process suspends

278
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and then you can

279
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
go in and you can just tell it all to die right

280
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
there on the spot and the ones that don't

281
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
die they'll come back they'll get

282
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
woken up and then you can generally go back and

283
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
clean them up in a loop and kill them again.

284
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It seems like it was just a really simple kind

285
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
of way to sort of kill processes and

286
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I thought okay well that was you put it in the slack

287
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
so I don't I didn't mean to steal it but what did you

288
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
no no I think just just it's just good

289
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
to see the implementation of

290
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
something simple for a common problem

291
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
like that I'm sorry I'm doing it again

292
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
but that's what it was is it was

293
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
something simple for system where otherwise we

294
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
give we attribute systemd as this huge

295
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
monster and this is just a really

296
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
clean plain simple way to do something right

297
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
like there's plenty of things systemd does wrong I

298
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
will not try to say that it's this perfect piece of

299
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
software anything like that but when they do things

300
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
right or if there's something interesting

301
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
it's interesting to see and I have not

302
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
dived that deep into the internals

303
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
so it's cool to see like a filtered version

304
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
a look inside yeah

305
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
yeah so something that

306
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I've noticed that you guys didn't mention

307
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
there's also systemd

308
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
run gain support for a new pipe

309
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
command which allows you

310
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
to invoke arbitrary

311
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
processes as systemd services

312
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
so you get all the benefits of systemd like the systemd

313
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
logging while still allowing

314
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
to be integrated into the classic unix

315
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
shell pipeline fascinating

316
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
that is a good catch yeah right yeah

317
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
so you can like spin up a pipeline give it

318
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
a give it like a temporary working

319
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
to store all of its stuff logs

320
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
to the journal and then have it all disappear

321
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
as a user that no longer exists there you go

322
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
there you go so okay everybody okay

323
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
did everybody make it did you did you survive

324
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm in a cold sweat now but let's

325
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
just carry on

326
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
all right and that concludes our systemd

327
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
corner I just I thought we were going to need

328
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
a theme for this I know music

329
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm just hacking it together as we go right now

330
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
but I thought somebody screaming about doing only

331
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
one job sort of was appropriate for systemd

332
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
because sort of you know

333
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
okay so it's too appropriate yeah

334
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
well it's kind of ironically appropriate

335
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
so before we run Mr. West

336
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Payne and I had a chance to go to seagull

337
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
this week last week actually

338
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and Wes even had

339
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
a talk there which

340
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I attended and this was my first time

341
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
going to seagull it's in Seattle

342
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
at the Seattle Central College

343
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
and it ran this last weekend and

344
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
a lot of our friends are there

345
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
oh yeah Valerie from

346
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
the Ubuntu

347
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
in Oregon and Katie I think she

348
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
actually probably with Katie she was there

349
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Ian from

350
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
System76 was there

351
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
as well and he gave a talk as well

352
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
as he sat in a booth and

353
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
yeah it was

354
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
not a huge event in fact it sort of

355
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
hit that sweet spot if you want something

356
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
that's not a very very large production

357
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
but still has really interesting informative

358
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
talks it sort of nails

359
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
that like I'll give you an example like

360
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
so while Wes was giving a talk on

361
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Clojure

362
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
there was also a talk on

363
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
on how to

364
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
set up like a key

365
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
pass set up with your own private

366
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
sync and encrypted backup

367
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and in another room there was a talk about

368
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
how to wire an automated chicken

369
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
door using a Raspberry Pi

370
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
and like those were

371
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
the talks that were all going on at once

372
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
and it gives you sort of a it is like that all day

373
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
and almost every

374
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
talk there was something like I would really like to go to that

375
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and so you gave one

376
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
what did you think what was that process like for you

377
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
was that your first talk at a Linux event

378
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
at a Linux event yes I've given others

379
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
other talks but at a Linux event yes it was a lot of

380
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
fun it was super easy when I was

381
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
submitting and preparing and saying like oh do I

382
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
want to try to give one here all the

383
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
people in their IRC room the people volunteers

384
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
people running it super nice super helpful

385
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
really it's just a great conference

386
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm glad to have been a part I'm glad to have gone

387
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
to gone this year and I hope

388
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
you're right it wasn't super huge but

389
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I thought they got a good array like there's a lot of speakers

390
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
from not in this area Microsoft

391
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
was represented IBM had several people

392
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
there as you said system 76

393
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
so I think it's it's an up

394
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
newcomer hopefully something to watch and it

395
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
feels like you know Seattle's a big enough

396
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
tech hub with enough tech people

397
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
and companies there that it makes sense

398
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
for a Linux type event

399
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
like this to exist so

400
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
it sounds like this year went great

401
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I hope that keeps going yeah

402
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I found

403
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
it to be a little

404
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
smaller scale than like a Linux fest it was

405
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
more like a more like

406
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
a probably a crowd of like four or five hundred

407
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
yeah probably yeah and

408
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
it was at the venue was

409
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
a school Seattle Central College

410
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and it was in session

411
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
so at certain times

412
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
you were walking around the hallways with college

413
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
students going between rooms

414
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
which not quite

415
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
my thing but not bad

416
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
either a little chaotic but not bad

417
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I guess they had to do some rescheduling too

418
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
there was like an HVAC problem so they had to change some

419
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
of the rooms that they were using at the last

420
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
minute I don't know if that played a role there's always

421
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
complications like that but either way

422
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
nice group of people nice group of

423
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
talks definitely worth the travel

424
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
if you're in the area so yeah

425
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'll probably go back for a bit next year too

426
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I got to meet up with a few Jupiter broadcasting

427
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
listeners so that was cool I like that

428
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
and then the year I went the fire

429
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
alarm went off so you guys lucked out

430
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
ouch

431
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
and then after it was all done

432
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Wes and I went to Angela's

433
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Angela's family diner oh

434
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
that was a ton of fun yeah so we went down to Planet Java

435
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
diner and we got chicken strips Wes and I

436
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
were adorable and got chicken strips to get twinsies

437
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
we totally went twinsies on lunch

438
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and then and then you know what

439
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
we went and got cookies so it was actually

440
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
all around a pretty good time did you guys share

441
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
a milkshake no

442
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
no but those cookies

443
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
are worth getting they were super super

444
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
good so yeah it was Segal was a good event the Seattle

445
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
area is good if you can make it out

446
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
maybe go next year maybe

447
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
maybe and now and now we look forward my friends

448
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
now we look forward so there's

449
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
many things to chat about so let's take a moment

450
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and thank Ting for sponsoring the unplugged

451
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
program go to linux.ting.com

452
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
to sign up and that's where you'll get $25

453
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
off a device or $25

454
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
in service credit if you bring a device

455
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
check their BYOD page

456
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
because over there they'll list all the devices

457
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
that are compatible and you'll be impressed with the list

458
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
because they have a CDMA network and

459
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
a GSM network they have a really

460
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
well designed dashboard where it

461
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
gives you a quick access to

462
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
your minutes your messages or

463
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
your megabytes whatever you've used or you could turn

464
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
a line off or you could turn a line

465
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
on and just use only text

466
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
or only use data or only use phone like

467
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
you have all these really different granular

468
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
levels of control you can

469
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
say usage alerts you can name

470
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
the line so you don't have to go by the numbers but you can go

471
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
by like a easy to know alias

472
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
and then that shows up across like the mobile

473
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
apps too it's really sophisticated

474
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
now here's the nice thing

475
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
about a $25 service credit

476
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
you see your average Ting line is going

477
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
to be around $23 $24

478
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
a month and that's after your minutes

479
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and your messages and your megabytes are added up and the $6

480
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
for the line you're still going to be around

481
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
this pretty low price point

482
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
so if you get a $25 service credit it's going to

483
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
pay for more than your first month I really

484
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
really like that because that's what happened to me

485
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
and that that experience that

486
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
that made me a Ting customer for life

487
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
and of course they've got devices you can buy directly

488
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
like I said you can bring your own and if you're

489
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
watching their Twitter page and

490
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
you can find that at Ting FTW on Twitter

491
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
you'll see that they're giving away 2 gigabytes

492
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
of data right now if you add a line

493
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
to your Ting account you'll get 2 gigs

494
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
of free data so if you're

495
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
already a Ting customer check that out

496
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
if you're not go to

497
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
linux.ting.com linux.ting.com

498
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
and a big thank you

499
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
to Ting for sponsoring the Linux

500
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Unplugged program linux.ting.com nationwide

501
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
coverage with no contracts and no

502
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
early termination fees whoa

503
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
linux.ting.com

504
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
so you found this really great

505
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I think you found this this really great

506
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
unless the beard found it I'm sorry if I'm misattributing

507
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
but this really great app called

508
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Tor Proxy which uses net filter

509
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
hooks in the Linux kernel to route all

510
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
of your network traffic to the Tor

511
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
network it uses net filter

512
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
hooks and then it just

513
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
makes sure that all of your outbound

514
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
traffic that of course the kernel would be

515
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
responsible for anyways gets routed to

516
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
the Tor network now here's a major

517
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
limitation it only supports IP

518
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
4 traffic and it's TCP IP

519
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
4 so no UDP

520
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
fancy shenanigans no

521
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
IP v6 and no pings

522
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
no ICMP pings get those

523
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
out of here yeah get those out of here but this is

524
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
a pretty neat thing could you

525
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
could give me a use case for this West

526
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
give me your best spy use case for this

527
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
like what do you got like an always secure

528
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Linux box as soon as you turn it on the kernel

529
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
routes all your traffic to Tor like listen what's

530
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
going on yeah I mean that or

531
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
yeah maybe you're using a you have a virtual machine or

532
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
you have like a you know a laptop with no

533
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
OS that you boot this up you load the module

534
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
you make sure that you know at no time

535
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
are you going to be able to send

536
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
packets out there except

537
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
through Tor yeah or you want

538
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
to run an application over Tor that doesn't

539
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
support proxies inside of

540
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
the application sure yeah yeah that's

541
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
good I bet you that'd be a big use case yeah

542
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Tor proxy and it's a kernel

543
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
module which who doesn't love a load in a good

544
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
kernel module I like how

545
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I like how simple it is it only has four arguments

546
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
oh really good

547
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I like I was gonna say I like

548
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
that they tested against kernel 3.16

549
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
so I'm like oh okay

550
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
but what are they what are the arguments

551
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
well you have dash S which is to insert the module

552
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
and start the proxy you have

553
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
dash I which is just to insert the module

554
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
you have dash R which is to remove

555
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
the module and you have dash T which is

556
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
to refresh the relay tables

557
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
that's pretty simple

558
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
that's it I can get I can get behind

559
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
that that's how you build your ultimate secure box

560
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
somebody make a live CD that

561
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
does that the the downside is the proxy

562
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
must be run as root and Tor

563
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
must be running so

564
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
you are putting

565
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
something network enabled

566
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
on root yeah

567
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
yeah that is a downside

568
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I also noticed like if you want to get to any hidden

569
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
services you're still gonna have to use a Tor browser to

570
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
do that yeah but I guess that's kind of expected

571
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
so I saw a question

572
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
on our Linux and I

573
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I know I've had offline conversations

574
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
with Wimpy about this but I

575
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
figured it might be on the minds of

576
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
a lot of listeners out there and

577
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I did show I did see it show up on our Linux so I

578
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
thought well let's let's talk about this for a moment and

579
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
maybe Wimpy you could chime in

580
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and share as much as you'd like

581
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I just want to find a game

582
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I think is or a name I think

583
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
is the person's handle on

584
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Reddit why did comp is die

585
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I don't understand people like

586
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
people act like comp is archaic or

587
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
maybe it's gimmicky and buggy that hasn't

588
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
been my experience at all I don't really understand

589
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
why it's gone away I like gnome shell

590
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
but I like comp is much much

591
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
more I'm actually going to jump to

592
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
XFCE and load

593
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
comp is and I don't understand why more people

594
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and more distros haven't done this so

595
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Wimpy how did

596
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
comp is and why is comp is dead and is it dead

597
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
well no comp is

598
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
isn't dead there's there's effectively

599
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
two strands of comp is that

600
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
are being actively maintained right

601
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
now there is comp is not

602
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
point nine which is the comp is you'll

603
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
find in Ubuntu

604
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
for example and that's

605
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
the C++ re-implementation

606
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
so it was forked from

607
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
the 0.8 branch

608
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
a whole load of stuff was reworked

609
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
and all of the plugins that

610
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
are available there were

611
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
also made to work with

612
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
EGL so they work on

613
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
things like ARM devices and what have

614
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
you and then you have

615
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
comp is reloaded

616
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
which is based on the 0.8 branch

617
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
so pre the C++

618
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
re-implementation and

619
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
has a wider selection of plugins

620
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
available but not all of those

621
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
are available for EGL

622
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
and both of those projects are alive and

623
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
well Ubuntu

624
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Marte ships comp is 0.9

625
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
by default obviously Ubuntu

626
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
16.04 is shipping comp is because that's

627
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
where a lot of the Unity functionality

628
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
is

629
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
exposed

630
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
and I

631
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
think I'm right in saying that the Fedora

632
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Marte spin comes with

633
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
comp is reloaded

634
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
so you know it's funny because

635
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Veritunda makes the obvious joke

636
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
in the room and you're right Veritunda everybody

637
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
when you say comp is you think of things like

638
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
cubes or

639
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
the aquarium

640
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
my windows don't wiggle anymore wiggly windows

641
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
wobbly windows

642
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
yeah I mean if you've got no taste

643
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
then

644
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
those things are turned on by default

645
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
then Linux is the place to be

646
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
if you're actually using comp is for

647
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
you know feature enhancement then

648
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
maybe comp is

649
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
used a little bit more sensibly and

650
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
tastefully yeah that's always why I've liked

651
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
it is because it always gave my system

652
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
this feeling like it

653
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
was keeping up with me like the

654
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
smoothness to the window draws

655
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
and movements to the windows and

656
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
the fact that maybe my disk

657
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
might be busy but the windows would still

658
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
render rather cleanly and smoothly

659
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
to me that was always the

660
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
draw to comp is I think my

661
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
favorite comp is feature was actually

662
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
it was my first experience with

663
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
live previews

664
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
in your alt tab menu oh yeah

665
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
yeah and also like hover over

666
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
the icon and see like a

667
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
preview of your minimized window window

668
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
peaking yeah yeah there

669
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
is some genuinely useful functionality

670
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
in comp is and you know if you're

671
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
using a desktop environment which is

672
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
using X then

673
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
it's a great way to get

674
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
in most cases a tear-free

675
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
experience and also in

676
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
my experience I've been working on comp

677
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
is for just over two and a half

678
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
years now I don't find it

679
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
to be buggy or crashy you often see

680
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
throwaway comments you know in the various

681
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
or it steals a lot of frames per second

682
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
or memory oh it's you know it's crashy

683
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
and it's buggy well I don't

684
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
see that I use it all day

685
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
all the live long day for years

686
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
and I don't think I've ever seen

687
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
comp is actually crash

688
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
on me it's usually something else

689
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
yeah that causes you know

690
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
a disastrous failure it's not comp is

691
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm inclined to agree my

692
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
my main machine

693
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
is a 1604 machine so it's Unity

694
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
7 comp is based but

695
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
comp is I don't even think

696
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
about comp is on a daily basis

697
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I don't really think about Unity 7

698
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
on a daily basis it's just the

699
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
thing that puts windows on my screen and I tend

700
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
to leave my machine on all the time

701
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and I get quite decent uptime

702
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
without my desktop

703
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
dying in any way shape or form

704
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
so yeah that might have been the case

705
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
some time ago and there may have been some instability

706
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
when comp is

707
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
0.8 transitioned over

708
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
to C++ in the 0.9

709
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
and the early days of Unity plugin

710
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
but these days

711
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I don't see it being anywhere

712
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
near as crashy

713
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
as people say in fact I

714
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
before I joined this hangout

715
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I was playing a

716
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
3D accelerated game

717
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
via Steam on one display

718
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
while displaying other stuff on

719
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
two other displays and everything

720
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
just worked perfectly and I didn't get any

721
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
rendering issues or crashing at all

722
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
it's just expected

723
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
that it just works and it does in 2017

724
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
it does yeah I've really had no problem with it

725
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
we have a machine here in the studio running

726
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Unity 7 on the LTS last

727
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
LTS release and I never

728
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
think about comp is I never give it two

729
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
thoughts the only thing I ever think about is the interface

730
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
always seems fairly responsive

731
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
and I appreciate that aspect

732
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
of the computer yeah definitely you know it gives me

733
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
it gives me some pause though now

734
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
that I think about this because you've

735
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
all just made really great points comp is still

736
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
maintained it technically does

737
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
something superior that we all

738
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
enjoy and while we have projects out there like

739
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
kwin which are great projects

740
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I still find projects like

741
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
comp is to still have a considerable amount of value

742
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
specifically for me

743
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
and how I use Linux just

744
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
you know for me personally I

745
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
like using a desktop with comp is

746
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
and I wish you

747
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
and millions of other people I wish there was a

748
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
way to have that with gnome 3

749
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
because

750
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
that's what I'm going to miss I think the most

751
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
about the transition for the

752
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Ubuntu desktop is

753
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I was always one of the things I liked the most is when I would

754
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
load up a Unity 7 Ubuntu desktop

755
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
which I didn't use very often

756
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
but when I loaded it I was always like

757
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
gosh this thing is smooth and polished

758
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I think comp has played that role

759
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
and I admit I'm a little

760
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
biased at the moment because just before we went on air

761
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
gnome 3 crashed and we lost audio

762
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
on our live stream again and we're back

763
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
to having gnome 3 crashes after

764
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
weeks of things working great and

765
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
we've made no software changes at all

766
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
and yet we're now back to

767
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
having gnome 3 crashes so I do admit I'm

768
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
a little

769
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
but let's not get roasted into spectacles

770
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
when Ubuntu switched

771
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
to Unity it was pretty fraught

772
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
and Unity in the early days

773
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
and comps in the early days

774
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
was pretty unstable

775
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Yeah I guess I feel like I've gone through that though

776
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I don't really feel like doing that again

777
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Right well you don't have to because the

778
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
1710 release is an interim release there's no

779
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
reason why you

780
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
as a normal user I don't mean you Chris as a

781
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
podcaster and a tech journalist I mean

782
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
a normal user would have to upgrade to

783
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
1710 they might do it out of curiosity and they might

784
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
run it in a VM or on a spare laptop but there's no

785
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
obligation to run it

786
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
other than curiosity so wait for

787
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
the 1804 release when things are a bit more

788
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
stable and the upstream gnome

789
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
developers have had a ton of

790
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
bugs filed by

791
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
quite a few Ubuntu users

792
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
who are enthusiastic and do want to

793
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
try this stuff early

794
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
but I think when you get to 1804

795
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I think

796
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
given that Unity 7

797
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
has stabilized over the last

798
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
like 3 years 4 years or so

799
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
you picture where we'll be

800
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
with gnome shell in

801
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I don't know the 20

802
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
2020 LTS

803
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
release just think how rock solid that

804
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
2020 release I know that's quite

805
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
a hard picture for some people to grasp but

806
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
think how stable that's going to be

807
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
and that's effectively where we are with Unity 7

808
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
That's a good point

809
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
and that is the nice aspect

810
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
about LTS's and the fact that there's many

811
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
other desktops out there that

812
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
we do have

813
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
there are other islands

814
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
we can hop to and

815
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
time does seem to heal these wounds

816
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
so while we're talking about the march towards

817
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
1804

818
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I noticed that the Ubuntu Mate

819
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
project has a very interesting

820
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
announcement in fact some of my friends on

821
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Twitter seem to be rather excited about this too

822
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Ubuntu Mate will be pioneering

823
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
a snap pre-installed

824
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
so when you install Ubuntu Mate

825
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
17.10 there will be a snap

826
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
pre-installed and it looks like

827
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
it's going to be the pulse audio mixer

828
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Wimpy can you tell me a bit about this?

829
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Yeah I can so

830
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
as of yesterday

831
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I believe that landed so

832
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
you were at the Ubuntu rally

833
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
and this was one of the outcomes

834
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
of the Ubuntu rally which was

835
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
how do we

836
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
put the last pieces in place so that it's

837
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
possible to ship a snap

838
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
pre-installed by default

839
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
in the ISO images

840
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
and I was approached as

841
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Ubuntu Mate

842
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
to sort of sound

843
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
me out to see if we'd be able to do this

844
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
and work on this so that we could

845
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
learn some lessons

846
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and feed that back to the

847
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Ubuntu desktop team proper

848
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
so they've got sight of

849
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
how things have gone and what

850
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
we've learned in readiness

851
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
for 1804. So

852
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
we've chosen to ship

853
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
the pulse mixer application

854
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
by default which is a

855
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
console based mixer for pulse

856
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
and in fact when I was

857
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
fumbling with my audio earlier

858
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
it was actually that that I used to

859
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
sort my volume levels out

860
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
because it's quite fine grained

861
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
in what it can do. So

862
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
that's now pre-installed by default

863
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
on the daily images so we've got a post

864
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
over at community.ubuntu.com

865
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
which is a

866
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
call for testing for anyone who's

867
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
interested in Ubuntu not necessarily

868
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Ubuntu Mate to come and grab

869
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
the daily images and test

870
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
it and make sure that that pulse

871
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
mixer application is working correctly.

872
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
So there's a lot to what you just

873
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
said and this is

874
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
remarkable. So there's a lot

875
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
a listener could infer based

876
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
on this conversation so I think we should

877
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
be pretty clear. You

878
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
say you're shipping a snap in Ubuntu Mate

879
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
in preparation for 1804.

880
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Now if I were an alarmist

881
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'd say that means that 1804 everything

882
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
is going to be snapped. That's not what's happening here right?

883
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
No there's no

884
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
plans for everything to be a snap in 1804

885
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
although you know

886
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
if there was a new flavor

887
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
to crop up where everything being

888
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
a snap made sense then

889
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
that would be possible. You know there could be some

890
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
interesting use cases for this sort of

891
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
thing like

892
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Ubuntu Kodi for example.

893
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
You know you could have an Ubuntu Kodi

894
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
distribution where Kodi is

895
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
provided as a snap and is

896
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
permanently upgraded to the latest

897
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
stable release even though that you're

898
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
on an LTS that's you know running

899
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
for five years you know unchanging

900
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
but the core application

901
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
moves on top. That would be quite

902
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
a nice way to do this.

903
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Or an Ubuntu kiosk

904
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
that has just like

905
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
the base install and a browser

906
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
and that's it and the

907
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
networking stack and everything is nicely

908
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
confined so someone coming up to use that kiosk

909
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
knows that nothing else is going to

910
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
infringe upon the data

911
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
that they're saving at that time.

912
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
So why Pulse Audio Mixer

913
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
or Pulse Mixer

914
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and

915
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
what does having it installed by

916
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
default what kind of

917
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
value does that have?

918
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Right well the particular

919
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
reason that this application has been

920
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
chosen is because until it

921
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
was a snap there was no easy way

922
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
to install this on Debian and Ubuntu

923
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
because this application has never been in the

924
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Debian or Ubuntu archives before

925
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
and in fact it was Popey spotted

926
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
what's called an ITP

927
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
on the Debian mailing list.

928
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
An ITP is an intent to package

929
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
and that was a request by somebody

930
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
to say package this software for Debian

931
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and Ubuntu. So

932
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
in the two weeks that have elapsed

933
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
since that ITP post

934
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
a snap has been created

935
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
it's in the snap

936
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
store for the appropriate

937
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
archives and the necessary support

938
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
to embed snaps in ISO

939
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
images has been added

940
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
to the build infrastructure and now

941
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
we're shipping a snap by default.

942
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Which is an interesting story when you

943
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
think about what we've heard

944
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
about projects like Nextcloud and

945
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
you know software that's frozen

946
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
in archives and how that causes

947
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
maintenance issues for developers

948
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
and all the rest of it and that the time

949
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
that they have to wait before the next version

950
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
gets into the archive.

951
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
So there's a very interesting story here

952
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
about a fast moving piece of software that

953
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
is now being deployed by default

954
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
in an ISO image and the

955
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
speed at which that's been done.

956
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And this implementation isn't

957
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
complete at the moment. So at the moment

958
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
it's kind of tightly

959
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
coupled with the live

960
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
build system

961
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
and what we're going to be doing is

962
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
exposing this in the usual way

963
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
that people that make

964
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Ubuntu flavors

965
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
are used to for what's called

966
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
seeding packages that go in their live

967
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
image. And I see on the

968
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Ubuntu

969
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
community hub the Ubuntu

970
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
budget team have replied and said you know they

971
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
were interested in doing this and they wanted

972
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
some more details about how this was done

973
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
because they have a number of snaps

974
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
that they would be interested in shipping by

975
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
default in Ubuntu budget.

976
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And what do you learn by

977
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
having something like this installed because it's

978
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
not just a matter of making it available to

979
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
install which I could do now but there

980
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
is got to be value in

981
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
a certain amount of user base

982
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
having this installed by default.

983
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Yeah so there's a couple of things

984
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
there. Oh goodness.

985
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
The first is

986
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
that you know the build infrastructure has

987
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
to be able to install this snap into

988
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
the ISO as it's being

989
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
constructed. And it's not just the snap

990
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
of course because the snap sits on top

991
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
of the core snap

992
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
as well. So the core snap

993
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
is being shipped by default

994
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
in Ubuntu Mate 17.10

995
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
now. Which normally what

996
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
happens is the first time you install a snap

997
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
the core snap gets installed

998
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
as well.

999
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
So the core snap and this

1000
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
snap are shipped by

1001
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
default. And what we'll do is

1002
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
sometime after the release

1003
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
we'll push out an update

1004
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
to PulseMixer

1005
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
and we'll be able to make sure

1006
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
that all of the backend infrastructure is

1007
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
geared up appropriately to cope with

1008
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
that demand for updating

1009
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
all of those systems. So there's some backend

1010
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
soak testing being conducted

1011
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
as well. That makes a lot of sense.

1012
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It was super critical that we choose

1013
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
something nice and small that doesn't

1014
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
have a super big impact on the

1015
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
size of the ISO image but also

1016
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
is a useful utility.

1017
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
We don't want to just throw shovelware on

1018
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
the ISO. We wanted to put something on

1019
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
there that's actually quite useful and

1020
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
PulseMixer is actually a kind of

1021
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
useful thing to like open a terminal type

1022
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
PulseMixer and have a nice little

1023
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
thing that you can use to adjust the levels

1024
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
on your microphone and your speakers and your

1025
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
headset and all that kind of stuff. It's actually a cool tool.

1026
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
So it fulfills

1027
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
like all of the requirements for

1028
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
putting something on the CD.

1029
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Think PAVU control but

1030
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
for the console. I was just wanting

1031
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
that. I think I'll be snap installing this later

1032
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
today. We're making an official pic of the show today.

1033
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Go check it out. It's PulseMixer and

1034
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
you can get it as a snap too. Which I guess would be

1035
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
what? Snap search PulseMixer if you want to see the

1036
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
entry? Snap install PulseMixer

1037
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Snap Info PulseMixer. Both of those work.

1038
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
There you go. And then

1039
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
if you look at like the screenshot here

1040
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
on the Ubuntu community page

1041
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
you can see that you can individually control

1042
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
the volume of particular Chrome tabs too

1043
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
which that's pretty cool.

1044
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And then Mumble and individual applications.

1045
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Also you'll see that Wimpy has a

1046
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Scarlett USB analog which

1047
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I approve. I like that.

1048
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I love that. It's great audio interface.

1049
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
That's what we're talking on

1050
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
right now actually. We are talking on one of those.

1051
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
It's not the only one we have but that's the one

1052
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
on this machine. Well fascinating.

1053
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
So I

1054
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
suppose this is really early days

1055
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
but my last question might be

1056
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
what are your thoughts on sharing

1057
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
what's discovered?

1058
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Well I think that that will

1059
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
be some months from now before

1060
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
we see enough users

1061
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
installing Ubuntu Mate and having

1062
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
this snap pre-registered on people's

1063
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
machines and then we'll push an update

1064
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
out. And what's interesting is

1065
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
the plan for the update is to push out

1066
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
a version of the snap that's actually smaller

1067
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
than the snap that's being deployed

1068
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
on the ISO image.

1069
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Do we talk much about that?

1070
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Do we talk much about that on the show?

1071
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
That was another thing that kind of came up

1072
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
at the Ubuntu rally that

1073
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
was a rather impressive piece of

1074
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
work.

1075
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
And I don't want to steal the thunder but it sounds like

1076
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
there could be kind of a big change coming to the size

1077
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
of snaps.

1078
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Yeah, I mean this was

1079
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I think actually if Daniel's here

1080
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
it was actually one of the elementary

1081
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
applications that saw the biggest

1082
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
reduction in that whole exercise.

1083
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Oh snap!

1084
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Tell me.

1085
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Well it was really interesting because we're

1086
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
digging into the idea

1087
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
of the platform snap, right?

1088
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And trying to make sure

1089
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
that the size of the snaps

1090
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
were comparable to

1091
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
their deb package equivalents.

1092
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
And because we're kind of sticklers

1093
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
about that kind of stuff and we kept poking

1094
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
and going, can it get smaller? Can't it get

1095
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
just a little bit smaller? And Ken

1096
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
was just furiously typing

1097
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
you know, okay maybe if we did this and

1098
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
did that and we finally poked him

1099
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
enough that he found a hidden

1100
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
off by default option that just

1101
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
drastically reduces the size of

1102
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
snaps. Really?

1103
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
The really cool thing was Ken found it

1104
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
via the KDE developers

1105
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
who were also there at the rally.

1106
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It was actually one of the KDE

1107
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
developers, Scarlett, who's been

1108
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
going like a machine

1109
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
snapping all the KDE

1110
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
apps. There's loads of them been pushed in

1111
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
the store. And she said, oh yeah you want

1112
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
this option and this will make your snaps

1113
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
much smaller. She passed that on to Ken

1114
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
and then that little word of mouth

1115
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
thing made all the snaps much smaller.

1116
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Not just the elementary ones but all the

1117
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
known ones as well. It was great.

1118
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Yeah, significantly smaller.

1119
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
I think in the case of, was it

1120
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
local that was being snapped at the time, Daniel?

1121
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
No, we were actually just doing the calculator.

1122
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
We were trying to start simple.

1123
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I think it was something like

1124
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
9 meg and then this change was made

1125
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
and it was 136k.

1126
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
That's quite the diet.

1127
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
That is really good work.

1128
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
That's

1129
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
something that should just make it across Mark's

1130
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
desk at some point. Like if nothing else

1131
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
we can take that away from the Ubuntu

1132
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
rally, Mark. We got that.

1133
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
That's a good

1134
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
point. Well, good work gentlemen.

1135
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Curious to see where this goes

1136
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
and of course the timeline is rather

1137
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
obvious I suppose because this is all an effort to collect

1138
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
data for 1804 in a sense

1139
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
to determine how far

1140
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
you go. So I guess in

1141
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
a sense you're going to have to kind of turn this thing

1142
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
around in a few months really.

1143
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Yeah, I don't know what the

1144
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
plans of the desktop team are but

1145
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
you will have seen that

1146
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Ken, as we just

1147
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
discussed, Ken has been snapping a

1148
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
number of the GNOME desktop

1149
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
applications and other members of the

1150
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
desktop team have been doing the same.

1151
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It may well be that

1152
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
some of those applications ship

1153
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
as snaps in 1804

1154
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
and you have an LTS with

1155
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
rolling applications sitting

1156
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
on top.

1157
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
And you know

1158
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
the thing that's interesting

1159
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
here is there's this popular

1160
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
meme in the community

1161
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
that snaps are only for IoT and

1162
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
server and don't work for desktop

1163
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
apps and Ken is totally

1164
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
proving that wrong in

1165
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
multiple ways like

1166
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
the Snap Demon that runs

1167
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
on 1804 next year

1168
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
is the same Snap Demon that

1169
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
runs on 1604 that was released

1170
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
a year ago and that's the same

1171
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Snap Demon that was

1172
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
available for 1404 that

1173
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
was three years ago.

1174
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
So he can put one

1175
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
GNOME application, 3.26

1176
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
GNOME application in the store

1177
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
and that same Snap works

1178
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
on 1804, 1604, and

1179
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
1404. The exact same

1180
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
application packaged once

1181
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
runs on multiple LTSs

1182
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
and non Ubuntu

1183
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
systems as well. That is an

1184
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
epic win. There you go.

1185
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
I guess we should

1186
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
probably move forward but

1187
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I guess this is all really

1188
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
you know I'm going to say this.

1189
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
What the bigger picture is

1190
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
is that 1710 is now days

1191
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
away and a lot

1192
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
of this stuff is falling into place and that's really

1193
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
the meta story around all

1194
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
of this and

1195
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'm going to give a plug to the last two

1196
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
episodes of Ask Noah. You got to

1197
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
check those out if you are not a routine

1198
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
listener of his show. First of all he's been

1199
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
killing it recently and second of all

1200
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
he has two interviews

1201
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
that are split across to episode

1202
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
29 and episode 28

1203
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
and start with 28

1204
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
and it's an interview

1205
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
maybe Martin

1206
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
or Poppy if you know the name of the developer

1207
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
that Noah was interviewing but

1208
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
It's Jerry Boland. Thank you.

1209
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
He had a great interview with Jerry and

1210
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
it talks a lot about

1211
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Canonical's thoughts around Wayland

1212
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and how to implement it correctly where

1213
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Mir could still have a very

1214
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
real role especially for smaller desktop

1215
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
projects and what

1216
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
the hell happens if 1710

1217
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
ships Wayland by default and it blows up

1218
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
in everybody's face. What happens

1219
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
then? All of that is in episode

1220
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
28 and then in episode 29

1221
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
of the Ask Noah show and so

1222
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
good additional background information

1223
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
as we get really close to the 1710

1224
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
release.

1225
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I can hear you wanting to

1226
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
wrap up this Ubuntu stuff.

1227
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
I know there's one more thing we want to get to so go ahead.

1228
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
There is yes. Yeah.

1229
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It's all yours. You have the floor.

1230
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Well Poppy you've

1231
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
been doing a lot of the local comments.

1232
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Poppy you have the floor.

1233
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
You have the floor Poppy.

1234
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
So as you mentioned

1235
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Chris it's a few days away from the 1710

1236
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
release and it turns

1237
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
out that the Ubuntu project

1238
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
kicks out a ton

1239
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
of ISO images. It's not just Ubuntu

1240
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
with Gnome. There's all

1241
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
the flavors as well. There's that little

1242
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
known one called Ubuntu Mate

1243
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
and then there's all the other really big ones as

1244
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
well. So Ubuntu, Lubuntu,

1245
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Ubuntu Studio.

1246
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
There's just tons and

1247
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
we need

1248
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
some help from our community

1249
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
to help us test those and

1250
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
we would really love it if people

1251
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
could join us on Monday. We're having a

1252
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
hangout on Monday.

1253
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
1500 UTC I think

1254
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
it is where myself and Martin

1255
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
are going to go through all you need to do

1256
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
to download the ISO images get

1257
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
these things booted up on a machine

1258
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
and a USB stick test that

1259
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
stuff out report bugs. Let us

1260
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
know what's busted so that we can

1261
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
get that stuff fixed. Now we're not saying you'll get fixed

1262
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
for release which is next

1263
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Thursday the 19th of October

1264
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
but we'll certainly get stuff queued up

1265
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
for immediately after release if

1266
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
it's super critical. So yeah

1267
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
join me and Martin. If you go

1268
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
to Ubuntu On Air there's a nice

1269
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
little YouTube video you can

1270
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
you can watch next Monday

1271
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
on the 16th of October at

1272
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
1500 UTC. So that's

1273
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
the URL to go to is ubuntuonair.com

1274
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
next Monday.

1275
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Yep. You can go to

1276
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
our community site community.ubuntu.com

1277
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
and there's a pinned post there

1278
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
as well and you'll find

1279
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
a post about this. It's all about

1280
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
just the easy way to get

1281
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
a smooth transition into the Ubuntu community

1282
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
helping people out and

1283
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
getting stuff tested. If you got a little

1284
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
bit of spare time it would be super appreciated.

1285
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Yeah. You know what I'll put a link in the show notes

1286
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
because you might not out

1287
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I don't always get a chance to file a bug

1288
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
for every little thing. I don't get to test

1289
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
every little bit but I can download

1290
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
an ISO and give it a go and

1291
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
that's something we can all do.

1292
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And that's part of the problem

1293
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
is you know people find it difficult to do

1294
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
that. The process of finding

1295
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
bugs is a little bit abrasive. We want to make that

1296
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
easier and if it's difficult

1297
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
you just tell us what the bug is. We'll reproduce

1298
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
it. We'll file the bug right.

1299
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
We'll help you through that process.

1300
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
We want to make it easy. But what we need is

1301
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
lots of different people to test this stuff on

1302
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
diverse platforms

1303
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
lots of different systems. Not just

1304
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
the same ThinkPad that everyone in the

1305
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
company has. How about I'll bring

1306
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
my Macbook that I use for

1307
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
video editing. How would you like that?

1308
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Nobody wants that.

1309
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Although I do have a Librem 15 I could

1310
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
bring to the party.

1311
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
I'll bring my System76 Lemur guys.

1312
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
There you go. That's good. Got to make sure that

1313
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
works because there we go. That's three people.

1314
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Yeah.

1315
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
We've got this Librem 15 here in studio

1316
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
that we've got to talk about.

1317
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I've been using it

1318
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
now for about three weeks

1319
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
and I wasn't really quite sure

1320
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
how to really do

1321
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
this review until

1322
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I went to the Ubuntu rally and I brought this as my

1323
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
daily driver for the rally. Then it all just sort of

1324
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
clicked together. Now the timings worked

1325
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
out really well with them nailing

1326
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
their crowd funders. We're going to talk about

1327
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
all of that. We've got to get to this thing. We've got to

1328
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
discuss this. Although

1329
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
we're running a little tight I'm hoping we'll still

1330
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
have time to also talk about

1331
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
episode 250 and beyond.

1332
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
But first

1333
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
DigitalOcean. DigitalOcean.com

1334
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Go over there and create your account

1335
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1336
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
It's one word and you get a $10 credit.

1337
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Now you can do a lot with this $10 credit.

1338
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Traditionally I would say go spin up a

1339
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
droplet. Go like the $5 a month rig.

1340
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Run it for two months for free. Go like a maniac.

1341
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Lots of distros, great

1342
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
dashboard, data centers all over the world.

1343
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
But now

1344
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
there's a whole new thing you could

1345
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
use that $10 credit for.

1346
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Wes I've got to recommend

1347
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
if you haven't had a chance yet you've got to

1348
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
try out the new DigitalOcean spaces.

1349
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
It's

1350
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
remarkable how straightforward

1351
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
this is. It's simple

1352
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
reliable object storage.

1353
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And if you want to use it with their

1354
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
crazy great simple API and

1355
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
programmatically create storage

1356
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
and transfer stuff

1357
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
into it and then destroy the storage

1358
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
you can do that.

1359
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
If you also just want to upload

1360
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
some files through a nice web UI

1361
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
generate a public URL that expires

1362
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
after a couple of days and can be

1363
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
downloaded X number of times and send it out

1364
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
you can do that. And what's

1365
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
really nice about that is DigitalOcean

1366
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
has really

1367
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
great bandwidth. Like their

1368
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
hypervisors have 40 gigabit connections but the data

1369
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
centers themselves are nuts.

1370
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
And that's where these files are hosted.

1371
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You're getting the full blast

1372
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
of the DigitalOcean data center when you share these

1373
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
links. Right. You don't have to worry. It's not like you

1374
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
put it on some tiny little server

1375
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
and then oh whoops I shared

1376
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
this to so many people.

1377
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
It's prepared for that. When you're using it to share

1378
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
files super fast. When you're using it

1379
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
for crazy back end object storage

1380
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
it's intensely

1381
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
fast. And they're giving a two

1382
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
month trial right now. If you go over to

1383
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
DigitalOcean.com you create your account

1384
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
apply our promo code DOUNPLUGGED and you can try

1385
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
out their new spaces system. Beyond that

1386
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
though if you want to create a machine on their infrastructure

1387
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
be it Ubuntu or Fedora or

1388
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
FreeBSD or Debian they

1389
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
have the best UI to do

1390
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
this. They have a system that will

1391
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
get you going in less than 55 seconds.

1392
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And if you want to attach this traditional block

1393
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
storage that just shows up as like a

1394
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Dev SDA device or whatever they

1395
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
have that too. You don't have to go

1396
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
with the fancy new object storage

1397
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
if that ain't how you roll. They have monitoring

1398
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
alerting. They have load balancing as a service

1399
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
and tons of pre-built open source applications ready

1400
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
to go.

1401
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Just really all I have to say right there. There's really no

1402
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
reason like just go sign up get that you know.

1403
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Ten dollars. You can

1404
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
roll with that for quite a while especially with that three cents

1405
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
an hour which is my favorite rig. Yeah

1406
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
right. Like there's tons of times there's times where I have no

1407
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
droplets going for a little while. You know I'm just not I don't have

1408
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
any. I have some other things going.

1409
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
But in like less than a minute I just

1410
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
open my browser bump on over there

1411
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
several new servers. I did that last night.

1412
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
It's so helpful. Once you have everything set

1413
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
up you've got your SSH keys in there.

1414
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
It just becomes part of your workflow.

1415
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Yeah it's a fun way to play with new open source

1416
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
projects that you've been thinking around with or something you find

1417
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
on GitHub. It's pretty cool.

1418
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
It's pretty cool.

1419
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
DigitalOcean.com use the promo code DO

1420
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
unplugged all one word you apply to your account

1421
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
after you get started. And a big thank you to

1422
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
DigitalOcean for sponsoring the unplugged

1423
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
program. So yeah let's start

1424
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
this guys in Mumble Room. Please feel free

1425
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
to jump in if

1426
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
you have any questions as we go

1427
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
along. Now

1428
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I want to start this review by talking about the

1429
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
obvious elephant in the room.

1430
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
And that is the fact that Purism

1431
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
reached their crowdfunding goal

1432
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
for the Librem 5 which is

1433
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
really kind of remarkable because it's a one point five

1434
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
million dollar target. Yeah that's

1435
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
impressive. Yeah. Yeah. And this as you

1436
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
recall we've talked about this. This is the five inch

1437
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
privacy focused smartphone

1438
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
that they're building from the

1439
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
ground up to use Matrix

1440
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
for encrypted communications.

1441
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
They'll have a separate CPU from the baseband.

1442
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
They're going to have kill switches for the camera.

1443
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Hello.

1444
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Oh. We have somebody

1445
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
at the door.

1446
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
We have the separate kill switches for Wi-Fi

1447
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
and cellular connectivity

1448
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
and things like that. And then of

1449
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
course they're also going to not necessarily

1450
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
prevent the possibility of connecting to an external

1451
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
display or keyboard and mouse because the thing's running

1452
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
basically Debian. It's pure OS

1453
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
or whatever with

1454
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
about three gigs of RAM if I

1455
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
recall. Yeah 32 gigs of storage and

1456
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
a courage jack aka the headphone port.

1457
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
And it's reached

1458
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
its initial goal and now they're shooting

1459
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
for the milestones I guess or

1460
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
not the milestones but the what do you call it?

1461
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
What are they called? Stretch goals.

1462
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Yeah.

1463
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Congratulations to them I suppose. Yeah that's good.

1464
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
And so if anybody in the mobile room has anything they want to

1465
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
comment on that aspect of the story before we

1466
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
continue feel free.

1467
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I say congrats to them and I hope this thing

1468
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
is a success. Just as a comparison like the

1469
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
mobile room 15 they had a $250,000

1470
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
goal they made twice that so

1471
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
almost $600,000 but this

1472
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
is a whole new scale of just projects.

1473
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Wow it really is. Yeah. Can you explain

1474
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
to me what a multi-function port is

1475
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
though? No.

1476
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Well do you ever wonder if one of your

1477
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
ports just didn't do enough you know?

1478
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
It only did the one thing?

1479
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I guess that just means USB-C.

1480
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
That's what I was thinking. I think the implication

1481
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
is it's a mobile device so it's only going to have a limited

1482
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
number of ports. You're not going to have like

1483
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
tons of ports all around the edges of the device.

1484
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
You'll have one and everything will connect

1485
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
to that maybe with a dongle or USB-C like

1486
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
you say. Yeah.

1487
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I've been following

1488
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
this with some interest because what seems to have

1489
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
really pushed it over the edge in the final

1490
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
last couple of days

1491
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
here was some

1492
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
people got in at really

1493
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
significantly high levels like I believe perhaps

1494
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
the highest levels

1495
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
which is quite remarkable because it

1496
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
caused quite the trajectory

1497
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
and

1498
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
it was a bit weird actually.

1499
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
A little while ago, a few

1500
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
days ago there were two people who

1501
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
went in at the

1502
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
$19,999 level and two people

1503
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
who went in at the $17,999 level

1504
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
within the same hour

1505
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
and then again

1506
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
this morning or earlier on today

1507
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
the same thing happened.

1508
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Two more at $19,999 and two more

1509
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
at $17,999. Now it

1510
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
makes me think that when you add those

1511
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
numbers up it's probably just

1512
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
one person investing but the only way that they can

1513
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
invest that significant chunk of money

1514
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
is to split it between those two

1515
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
and that totals up to the amount that they

1516
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
want to invest. There's someone

1517
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
who wants to invest in this thing and they're

1518
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
giving that amount of money. That's

1519
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
the only way it makes sense to me. There's no way

1520
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
you'd get four people

1521
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
within one hour

1522
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
giving that amount of money.

1523
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Yeah and you've been following the chart

1524
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
rather closely so I think you've got actually

1525
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
a good visualization

1526
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
of it

1527
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
and that seems possible

1528
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
and I suppose good for them.

1529
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I think they're running the crowdfunding

1530
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
site themselves so I don't know if they actually have

1531
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
to disclose who these people are but I sure

1532
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
would be interested.

1533
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I don't know. As a privacy

1534
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
focused device I can see them not doing it.

1535
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I can see them not wanting to do that

1536
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
and people who donate not wanting people

1537
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
to know who they are and that's perfectly

1538
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
reasonable.

1539
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yeah and

1540
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I think it's sort of with this

1541
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
as the background that I'm

1542
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
looking now at the

1543
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Alibrum 15 which is

1544
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
their rather high end

1545
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
laptop that's

1546
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
fairly competitive. This one is black

1547
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
it's all metal. It's

1548
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
15.6 inch screen.

1549
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It has a high end i7

1550
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
processor in it. It has

1551
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
very fast SSD drives. It has

1552
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
a sixth generation or

1553
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
seventh.

1554
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
If you get a chance over there give me a

1555
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
give me a read on the graphics

1556
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
because I think it's actually Intel 600

1557
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
but

1558
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
this was something that I didn't actually

1559
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
order. I didn't actually buy this.

1560
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
This was something that Purism thought

1561
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
would be appropriate to replace for me.

1562
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
So

1563
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
it's 520. OK. Thank you.

1564
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
OK. So

1565
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I have the very first

1566
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Alibrum 15 that they ever shipped that

1567
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
was slightly below what they

1568
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
had hoped to originally ship I think.

1569
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
And I

1570
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
know that they kind of hummed hot about it

1571
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
and they decided it was worth trying to make good on that.

1572
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And I respect that. That's really nice of

1573
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
them. And so I wasn't expecting

1574
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
this when it arrived. I just thought OK

1575
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
well this is really. So I came

1576
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
at it with this sort of like

1577
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
where does this fit. Right. Where does this

1578
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
fit in my life. And

1579
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
so I used it. You know I did the standard

1580
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
things like you know tried to push it to see how

1581
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
loud it could get and tried to

1582
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
push the battery and

1583
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
loaded Soulless and now it's going

1584
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
loaded Gentoo and yeah

1585
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
loaded Ubuntu and yeah now it's

1586
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
undergoing the beard test. And it was

1587
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
it wasn't until the trip to

1588
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
New York came up. Is that

1589
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
right. And I went OK

1590
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
because the

1591
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
the physical kill switches

1592
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
all of a sudden became

1593
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
a much more practical

1594
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
option because

1595
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I'm going into an area

1596
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
that I don't normally go into.

1597
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And

1598
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
why not just turn off the Wi-Fi like why not

1599
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
have that extra level of security. Now

1600
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
ironically iPhone 7 users

1601
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
did experience issues with Wi-Fi in

1602
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
New York so that Wi-Fi attacks

1603
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
were actually a problem in that very hotel.

1604
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Now it wasn't one for this but

1605
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I actually kind of I found a

1606
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
practical purpose and I will say this to

1607
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
their they are they are implemented in a cleaner

1608
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
less obvious

1609
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
way than the old

1610
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Librem 15. Is that right. So it's interesting. So we have it

1611
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
right here the old Librem 15 and they're

1612
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
like basically there's holes in the aluminum

1613
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
casing and then there is a

1614
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
old school electronic black toggle switch

1615
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
that sticks out of the aluminum.

1616
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Yeah. Now with this one it's like

1617
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
a nice etched

1618
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
plastic switch and

1619
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
the hole is sort of cut to the size that

1620
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
it needs to be for that switch.

1621
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Beard you have it right now. Do you agree with that.

1622
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Yeah. And they put it in.

1623
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Weren't they on the side before. Yeah. Well they

1624
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
stood out more because they were in a more obvious spot.

1625
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Yeah. Now they've put it more

1626
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
like close to the screen.

1627
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
And it has a matte display. I'm not

1628
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
I'm not blown away by the display to be

1629
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
honest with you. The viewing angles are a little rough from

1630
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
time. But if you're sitting if you're looking right

1631
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
at it it's a pretty great display. And the fact that it's

1632
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
non reflective is a nice

1633
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
change of pace. I'd say it's at least comparable

1634
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
or better than Lenovo displays.

1635
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Really. You like it. So you like it.

1636
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Yeah. Well I don't like Lenovo

1637
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
displays. So now

1638
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
the one thing so there's there's one thing that

1639
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
they're doing differently with the trackpad that I'm having

1640
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
a hard time adding

1641
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
a description

1642
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
to. It's a

1643
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
decently sized trackpad

1644
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
and it's it doesn't have like an obvious

1645
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
right or left side. It's just one big

1646
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
trackpad and it has some

1647
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
multi-touch support including like two finger

1648
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
scrolling and things like that. But it's

1649
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
it's texturized.

1650
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
It's texturized in a way that I like though

1651
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
in a

1652
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
in sort of a

1653
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
in a way that gives me

1654
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
sort of tactile feedback of where

1655
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I'm at on the trackpad like how much distance

1656
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
my finger has traveled. But not

1657
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
in a way that feels like I'm going

1658
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
against gunk on the trackpad. Like it doesn't

1659
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
it doesn't cause friction.

1660
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I disagree. Yeah I thought you might

1661
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
because to me it does feel very frictiony

1662
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
and I don't like it at all.

1663
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Yeah I thought you might. I'm a little more

1664
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
I'm coming more from the MacBook trackpad which is

1665
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
like slippery glass and I'm just

1666
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
like that's the other extreme and I'm like

1667
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
I think I like a little more traction right now.

1668
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Yeah I've definitely had like I don't mind

1669
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
the amount of friction on this one.

1670
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
It was pleasant enough. It's still

1671
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
smooth. I could move as fast as I wanted

1672
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
to. I've definitely encountered some trackpads where

1673
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
it feels like you're just dragging your finger

1674
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
across I don't know solid

1675
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
sandpaper. Another thing that I've noticed with the trackpad

1676
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
is if you drag your finger

1677
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
from the bottom like where the invisible

1678
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
buttons are

1679
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
it won't move the mouse

1680
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
and I haven't run into that with other

1681
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
trackpads.

1682
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
So that's a button only

1683
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
area. Yeah. One of the things I like is it does

1684
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
have hardware physical toggle right there

1685
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
you can do FN and toggle the mouse button off

1686
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
so you don't have to worry about like accidental

1687
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
when you're doing a lot of typing. Speaking of

1688
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
typing

1689
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I'm all over the map on this keyboard.

1690
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I think

1691
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
when I put the laptop down and pick it

1692
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
back up I'd like it a lot because

1693
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I've been experiencing RSI recently

1694
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and so this is one of those laptops where

1695
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
my fingers aren't being slammed into

1696
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
like a shallow keyboard hole

1697
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
there's there's travel

1698
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
and there's some good give to it

1699
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
and I like that

1700
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
aspect of it but my hands don't seem to quite

1701
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
line up. Yeah.

1702
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I think this keyboard

1703
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
would be perfect if they

1704
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
didn't include the number pad.

1705
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
It's funny you say that because I've been really enjoying

1706
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
having that number pad. Yeah I feel

1707
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
like you could if you really wanted a number pad

1708
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
that you could just get an external one and plug it in.

1709
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Yeah I suppose so.

1710
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
The way the keyboard is it feels cramped

1711
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
and too off center so my

1712
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
fingers are always on the wrong keys. Yeah I notice

1713
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
it the most when I'm typing like a complicated password.

1714
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Or when you're

1715
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
going through the Google doc for the show.

1716
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Ah yeah.

1717
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
But what do you think of the feel of the keyboard

1718
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
like if you're sitting down there because that particular

1719
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
problem if I'm typing a lot in a day

1720
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
I can I can generally reset

1721
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
and I can I can adapt.

1722
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
I like the feel of the keyboard.

1723
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
I feel like the

1724
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
I guess the base that's underneath it

1725
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
tends to

1726
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
send vibrations a bit too much.

1727
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Makes the whole laptop

1728
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
vibrate and it bugs me a little

1729
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
bit. So those are sort

1730
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
of the unique things that I feel like they've

1731
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
brought. And the reason why I wanted

1732
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
to talk about these things is because

1733
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
all of this feels different than a Clevo.

1734
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
It doesn't doesn't. I don't.

1735
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
This is this must not be a Clevo because this

1736
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
it doesn't feel like a Clevo at all. It feels like

1737
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
a custom built laptop

1738
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
and that's something that generally only

1739
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
get an impression of when I'm holding like an XPX

1740
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
or a ThinkPad in my hands.

1741
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
This feels like it

1742
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
was built for this

1743
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
purpose and it feels like it's a

1744
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
unique piece of equipment. It actually

1745
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
feels a lot like the razor

1746
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
blade laptops which

1747
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I like. Yeah it does.

1748
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And they have a they have a purism

1749
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
key on the super key there. So that's

1750
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
the aesthetics. And it's I've

1751
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
mentioned it's a it's a it's like an aluminum all

1752
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
black. And

1753
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
now the performance

1754
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
has been pretty great.

1755
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I've been trying to get

1756
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
fan issues to crop up because that's

1757
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
what I had original problems with

1758
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
and been quite happy with. Really.

1759
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
The acoustics have been quite. I mean I guess if you

1760
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
took it to New York you used it. Yeah.

1761
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
And you know in almost

1762
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
all cases I'd say

1763
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
battery life was pretty

1764
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
pretty pretty average. Were you using

1765
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
any like power top or

1766
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
you know I don't I wasn't I was

1767
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
just sort of going with do. Can I get my

1768
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
work done in the day. Yeah. And I was probably

1769
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
doing three and a half four hours worth of work and

1770
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
the battery was I just plugged in every single

1771
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
night and the battery lasted every day for me just fine.

1772
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
I'm going to I'm going to run a GPU benchmark and see

1773
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
if it gets on the fans. Yeah do it. Yeah go

1774
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
ahead because that is an interesting area to play with.

1775
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
So you have you have something

1776
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
that is

1777
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
notably better than

1778
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
the first model that I got in

1779
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
every single way. Obvious

1780
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
ways like the better CPUs

1781
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
the better graphics the faster

1782
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
SSDs the superior screen

1783
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
all of those ways. But

1784
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
in some of the ways that are truly

1785
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
purism to like the way

1786
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
the toggle switches are implemented or

1787
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
the obvious

1788
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
obvious care that went into

1789
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
the keyboard that

1790
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
feels uniquely purism

1791
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
and that actually does

1792
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
give me a lot of hope for

1793
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
the Librem 5.

1794
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
If anybody has ever owned a TiVo

1795
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
you know

1796
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
that the engineers of the TiVo

1797
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
must have spent the majority of their time

1798
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
developing the TiVo remote

1799
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
because that's truly the most innovative

1800
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
aspect of the TiVo was

1801
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
the perfect peanut remote.

1802
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
And you

1803
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
and nobody's ever beat the TiVo remote.

1804
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Nobody has ever created a better remote

1805
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
than the TiVo remote.

1806
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
And it feels like that's where purism is going with the

1807
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
keyboard. They're not there yet

1808
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
but when you sit down and use it it feels

1809
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
like something unique

1810
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
to them. It doesn't feel like a ThinkBad

1811
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
or a MacBook

1812
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
and I don't think they're quite there yet

1813
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
but you can tell a lot of thought and care

1814
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
went into that. And when

1815
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
you're looking at a lot of vendors out there a lot

1816
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
of whom I respect who are selling

1817
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
a repackaged Clevos in a way that

1818
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
some of those things are sort of standard across

1819
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
all of the models. It's really nice

1820
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
to see some differentiation here. I don't

1821
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
know where they're sourcing it from exactly so don't

1822
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
quote me on all of that but it generally

1823
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
somebody who has played with a lot of laptops

1824
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
it's nice to see a unique trackpad

1825
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
implementation and a unique keyboard

1826
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
implementation with

1827
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
what feels like their own hinge to

1828
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
on the laptop screen. And then

1829
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
the performance is as you would expect with

1830
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
any of this generation of Intel and

1831
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
and you know SSDs.

1832
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
It's like yeah it may not be perfect. It may not

1833
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
be where we want it to end up but

1834
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
it feels like there's been care and

1835
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
concern and design choices

1836
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
made. I opted not to use PureOS

1837
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
so they shipped it to

1838
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
me with no OS installed.

1839
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And I've tried

1840
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Solus. I've tried Gentoo and I've

1841
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
tried Ubuntu 17.10

1842
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
proper which is what's on there

1843
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
right now. And Beard I

1844
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
kind of wanted to get your thoughts about that too

1845
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
because

1846
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
it's like a really great

1847
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Ubuntu machine isn't it? Like it's just the new

1848
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
release and the black casing and

1849
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
the nice screen and the colors with the

1850
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
all black system. Like it all just

1851
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
goes really well together don't you think?

1852
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
And it says something about like

1853
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I didn't even realize that this was Gnome

1854
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
or Ubuntu 17.10

1855
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
until you told me because

1856
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
it looked just like a Unity

1857
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
desktop. Yeah it does look

1858
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
a lot like Unity 7 too. Yeah that as

1859
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
well. So the Librem

1860
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
15 is actually

1861
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
a contender. I really think it

1862
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
is. I don't know for myself

1863
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
if I would buy one today because what

1864
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I need from a system like this today

1865
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
is Thunderbolt 3 support

1866
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
in that USB-C port.

1867
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
And I'd like charging and I'd like external

1868
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
GPU because what I want to start doing

1869
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
is I want to start switching over to laptops

1870
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
that have Intel graphics built in

1871
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
with external GPU support so I can buy

1872
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
one GPU maybe once a year

1873
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
and then I can switch it between

1874
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
my systems. I

1875
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
was not able to get this to work

1876
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
with my external Thunderbolt 3 dock

1877
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
at all for power or for

1878
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
any devices external display or anything like that.

1879
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
That would be something for me

1880
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
that I would really really want.

1881
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Now however because now that I have this

1882
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
obviously I'm going to be

1883
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
using it for things so

1884
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
I'm now going to just make this my

1885
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Ubuntu 17.10 system for a while

1886
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
and it'll be my daily driver at home

1887
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
running Ubuntu 17.10. Nice.

1888
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
And yeah I think it's going to make

1889
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
a great home workstation for me. See for me

1890
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I think long term I probably would

1891
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
not like this. Mostly

1892
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
because it doesn't have a dedicated GPU

1893
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
built in. Yeah if you could see

1894
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
that's why I was thinking like here at work I'm going to want a dedicated

1895
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
GPU. So if you could hook up an external

1896
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
eGPU. Yeah but

1897
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
for someone like me I don't want to

1898
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
spend an extra five or six hundred dollars

1899
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
on an external GPU enclosure that I'm only

1900
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
going to use with one system. Oh yeah

1901
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I would use it across a couple systems yeah.

1902
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Wimpy sold me on that pretty heavily.

1903
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Definitely.

1904
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
But yeah

1905
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
good build. I would not

1906
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
be ashamed to take it into a coffee shop

1907
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
or conference. No

1908
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
it looks good and it's clean and

1909
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
there's no obvious branding on the top.

1910
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Yeah kind of like that. On the bottom there's

1911
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
like a Purism logo but it's just white on black

1912
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
it's nice and clean. I feel like this is actually

1913
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
a laptop if you took it to

1914
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
like a coffee shop or something people would ask you what it is.

1915
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Yeah.

1916
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
It's that good

1917
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
polish wise. Yeah and I've got

1918
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
I've got I picked up at Segal

1919
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I picked up an all white

1920
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
circular gnome logo.

1921
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
And it would look really good in the center of that

1922
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
laptop. But of course I

1923
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
may not end up writing gnomes out.

1924
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
But yeah you're right. Everyone has to know. You just have to have it

1925
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
installed you know. I feel like we need to do a

1926
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
hardware hack where we just put a glowing

1927
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
gnome foot on the back of the laptop.

1928
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
The next things I would

1929
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
yeah that'd be cool. The next things I'd really like to see from

1930
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
laptops like this is no power

1931
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
dongle needed. No separate power brick

1932
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
and dongle. I'd like to see everything

1933
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
being only powered off USB-C. That's an important one

1934
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
for me. It really simplifies things so we can get there.

1935
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I gotta say man when I was editing

1936
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
off of a car charger of cigarette

1937
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
adapter in a car off of USB-C

1938
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
I was like this is really useful.

1939
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
And this laptop couldn't do that and

1940
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
it made it not as usable in the car. And that's just

1941
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
a small thing. It's only really applicable to me.

1942
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Hashtag Chris problems. And then

1943
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
the other thing I'd really really really

1944
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
love to start seeing

1945
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
is I'd love to see some other manufacturer

1946
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
besides Lenovo integrate

1947
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
LTE modems or some sort of

1948
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
cellular connectivity into these

1949
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
sons of bitches. Right but not like not in a

1950
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
you can add it if you open it up and add

1951
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
but you know like a just like I can check it on the website.

1952
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
I just add a SIM. I add a SIM card when I

1953
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
get it and I can get connectivity because

1954
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I would love that. I would pick it all the time.

1955
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Having always

1956
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
on connectivity is such

1957
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
an important aspect to anybody

1958
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
that would be getting a machine

1959
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
like this that we're all

1960
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
either jumping on insecure Wi-Fi

1961
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
or we're tethering our devices

1962
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
in some cockamamie fashion or

1963
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
we're stopping by Starbucks constantly

1964
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
and getting on the free Google Wi-Fi and they monitor everything

1965
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
we do like there's no great option.

1966
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
And one of the things that drives me crazy about

1967
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Noah is him and his

1968
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
fancy ass Lenovo where the son of a gun

1969
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
has two batteries and an LTE

1970
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
modem and it all works under the

1971
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
same screen. I'm like I want to buy

1972
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
from a vendor who only builds Linux

1973
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
systems but has those things.

1974
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
So they're working on

1975
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
the keyboard. They're working on the trackpad. They're

1976
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
working on the matte display and

1977
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
they've really nailed the 15.6 inch

1978
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
you know system here.

1979
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
If the next generation

1980
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
could have USB-C charging and

1981
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Thunderbolt 3 and some sort

1982
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
of cellular connectivity with another

1983
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
hardware switch which is there with something

1984
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
they're great at. I would be

1985
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
all over that.

1986
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
You're making me drool Chris. That would be a great system.

1987
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
By the meantime if you don't need

1988
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
those things this

1989
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
system nails it. I was really impressed

1990
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
and what's your battery at right now

1991
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
because we've been off battery I don't know for

1992
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
at least two hours. We still have another

1993
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
four hours of battery left. Yeah okay there

1994
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
you go. Is that 67 percent? Okay

1995
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
so that's after about two hours of and you messing around

1996
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
on the system checking it out not probably doing

1997
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
benchmarks. Oh you are running some benchmarks.

1998
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Well it's not bad

1999
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
and no fans yet.

2000
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
No. Yeah that's really a thing about this one.

2001
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
When I was running the GPU benchmark I very

2002
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
slightly heard the fan. Yeah every now and then just a little bit

2003
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
but I'm pretty particular

2004
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
about that and I had it on

2005
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
my desk which is a glass desk so it just

2006
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
amplifies laptop fan noise

2007
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
and really no complaints.

2008
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
And in fact you know what

2009
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I had some benchmarks running on it when the room

2010
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
was way hotter than it should have been because

2011
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I didn't leave my window open I left my door

2012
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
closed and I got in there it was like 85 degrees

2013
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
in American imperial degrees

2014
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
and I got in there and it was

2015
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
it was

2016
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
ridiculously hot and that laptop

2017
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
was chugging away and the fan noise was

2018
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
still pretty respectable it was just like a little

2019
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
just a little background noise.

2020
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Damn. Wow. Just past the hot

2021
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
box test. Yeah.

2022
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
So I'm impressed and so I'm going

2023
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
to be packaging up my old one

2024
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
my old Librem 15

2025
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
and they're going to they're going to they're going to take it

2026
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
and probably put it under some sort of like

2027
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
quarantine or something I would imagine.

2028
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Maybe an honorary sacrifice. Yeah.

2029
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Viking funeral. Yeah. And melt it down and

2030
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
use its parts for the Librem 5. Yep yep.

2031
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
There we go. From the ashes. Recycling.

2032
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Alright

2033
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
well Mumble Room you guys have been pretty quiet during

2034
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
our review do you have any questions

2035
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
about this here

2036
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
hardware and about the Librem 15 before

2037
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
we move on or any thoughts too if you have

2038
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
about the Librem 5 feel free.

2039
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Yes I do. Go ahead.

2040
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
So I was wondering about

2041
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
I'm sorry about

2042
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
the kill switches.

2043
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
So if you

2044
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
really have the laptop

2045
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
by your side

2046
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
are the kill switches soft or hard

2047
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
and what can we expect if

2048
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
they just

2049
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
maybe break or stop

2050
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
working. Well I

2051
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
would I guess that have to be a warranty problem.

2052
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
So there they are hard

2053
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
plastic slide switches

2054
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
that slide to the

2055
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
they come shipped in the on position and

2056
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
you just pop them over to the off position

2057
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
sort of like similar to like a mute switch

2058
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
on a smartphone. It's basically a physical disconnect

2059
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I believe. Yeah it is. Yeah that's how they do

2060
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
it. So it just disappears

2061
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
to the operating system.

2062
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Oh that's OK. Thank you.

2063
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Yeah I think that's kind of nice

2064
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
actually and that's why I think they'd be

2065
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
one of the best vendors to ship a LTE

2066
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
motor because boy isn't that something I'd love to just leave

2067
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
switched off completely. Yes exactly. No

2068
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
doubts about it. No doubts about

2069
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
spying. No doubts about accidental data usage.

2070
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
No doubts about it. Just flip that switch

2071
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
off and then when I need mobile Internet I flip

2072
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
it on. I think that I think they'd nail

2073
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
it. Of course they'd probably say buy a

2074
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Liebman 5. Oh no.

2075
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
All right. Anybody else.

2076
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I'm good Chris. I don't really have

2077
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
anything on top of my head.

2078
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Yeah. And yeah. Well there

2079
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
you go. Beardsley you have any closing thoughts Beardsley

2080
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
on that before we move on. I just saw something I'm using

2081
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
the

2082
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
USB hubs that are inside

2083
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
the laptop. Apparently the vendor is listed

2084
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
as the Linux Foundation.

2085
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Really. Yeah.

2086
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I don't know why. I bet

2087
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
you we could find out. I bet you there's a good

2088
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I bet you there's a good story behind that. Yeah maybe.

2089
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
All right. So

2090
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
do you think we could take a little time to talk about

2091
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
the show or do you think we should wrap it up.

2092
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Anything. We can talk about

2093
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
it. I mean.

2094
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
All right. So this is a wild west plus we started

2095
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
a little late. So I'm just excited

2096
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
that Dan's here from elementary. I know.

2097
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
That's really cool. It's great to have you here Dan.

2098
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
It's great to be here.

2099
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
So Dan

2100
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
was just featured was it last week in the

2101
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
show. So check out interview with Dan

2102
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
that we just had last week.

2103
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
All right. So 218

2104
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
right now and

2105
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I was you know we've recently had a lot of

2106
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
changes.

2107
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
With the end of Lass

2108
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
and there's changes in the

2109
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
works in JB already

2110
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
that you don't know about.

2111
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
And so I wasn't really going to make any big

2112
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
changes here on this

2113
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
show because I felt like you know

2114
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
we'll just stay here. We'll be set

2115
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
a rock of the network. Right. Exactly.

2116
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Exactly. But

2117
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
in such then I began to wear

2118
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
weary worry weird worry

2119
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
about perhaps some stagnation.

2120
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
And so I thought OK well

2121
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
let's let's make changes by episode 300.

2122
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
And I thought

2123
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
about you know these things are actually pretty good.

2124
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
None of them are really a bad thing. So we should make these changes

2125
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
sooner. And so I think we're going to slowly start working

2126
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
towards some stuff with episode 250.

2127
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
So you're going to take a moment

2128
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
talk about the show.

2129
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Which we don't do very often. And

2130
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
all of this is subject to change as well.

2131
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Yeah.

2132
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Because things change right. Preliminary and

2133
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
meta and you know. Yeah.

2134
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Yeah. Speaking of things changing maybe

2135
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
it's time for you to change Linux Academy

2136
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
dot com slash unplug. That's where you

2137
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
go to learn more about Linux and all of the critical

2138
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
technology and the stacks of

2139
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
technology around. You got to call it a stack.

2140
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
That's what we get to call it a stack now.

2141
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Out of all of the terms we use

2142
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
stack is one of them we're going to take. Linux

2143
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Academy is a full featured training library

2144
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
with everything you need to know to learn new skills

2145
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
and advance your career in Linux.

2146
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
They have hands on scenario based labs

2147
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
that give you experience on real servers

2148
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
and they have self paced in-depth

2149
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
video courses which means when you

2150
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
have time you can get the work done.

2151
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
They have course schedulers so you can pick

2152
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
a time frame and stick to it with certain

2153
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
learning goals and they have human beings that can

2154
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
help you when you get stuck and they have learning

2155
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
passes which are a series of courses and contents

2156
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
planned by instructors for specific

2157
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
career tasks and they have practice

2158
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
exams which you can take before you actually

2159
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
go take the big test which probably would

2160
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
have been maybe one of the number one features

2161
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I was probably I mean

2162
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
maybe that maybe that and

2163
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
maybe the hands on labs for me would have been the two

2164
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
features when I was trying to get my certs that I could have used

2165
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
a lot more of as I couldn't

2166
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
imagine having Linux Academy back in the day

2167
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
when I was working in IT.

2168
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I mean I use it now just to dabble and one of the things

2169
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I love about it is you get like hour estimations

2170
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
of how long learning something is going to take

2171
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
and you get course where you can download with you

2172
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
and listen to offline like those are things that

2173
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
today I can appreciate but

2174
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
oh man when I was when I was playing

2175
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
that race of making sure I can get the certifications

2176
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
so that way I can either get improvements on

2177
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
the review or I can get that client

2178
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
I always got to taking the test

2179
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
and would sort of jam up there

2180
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
and if I could have taken more practice

2181
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
exams or I could have taken courses that were

2182
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
created specifically to prepare you for

2183
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
the certification exams that

2184
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
would have been a fundamental enabler for me.

2185
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Well and they're like you know you don't

2186
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
have to bootstrap yourself so especially if you're

2187
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
new to this can be pretty hard like okay well go set

2188
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
up your own test server at home figure out how to

2189
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
do that with Linux Academy like no just

2190
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
they'll get you right in the environment you need to learn

2191
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
whatever it is that you're actually working on

2192
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
and then after like once you've figured it out

2193
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
you just play with it so you can you know keep

2194
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
doing it do it again go advanced

2195
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
on it it's all right there and if you

2196
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
get stuck human beings are there to help

2197
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
and they're always adding new content

2198
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
and retroactively adding and

2199
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
proving the old content as well so

2200
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug

2201
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
to sign up for a free seven day trial and support

2202
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
the show linuxacademy.com slash

2203
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
unplugged and a big thank you to

2204
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged

2205
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
program so it is time for us to take

2206
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
bold action Wes bold

2207
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
action is required upon

2208
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
us here for the unplugged program turns out

2209
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
change is a way of life

2210
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
we're making it into a show about hot sauce

2211
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
well we are pivoting to a cooking show

2212
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
no

2213
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
well although sometimes

2214
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
we joke we one day we would just

2215
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
launch a cooking show just to get out of our system

2216
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
it feels like it's inevitable like it's

2217
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
gonna happen the beard and I joke about it

2218
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
all the time so okay

2219
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
let's talk about I consider them upgrades

2220
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
so let's talk about why the changes

2221
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
so right now Linux Unplugged

2222
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
is Jupiter Broadcasting's largest

2223
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
podcast which is funny because I don't

2224
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
think of it as that because I'm so used to

2225
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
having last be the largest podcast it's true

2226
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
though so that means it's probably

2227
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
up there in terms of largest

2228
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Linux podcast I don't know if I can't claim it's the

2229
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
largest although I think if you count video downloads

2230
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
it's got to be up there but who knows anymore

2231
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
last was so

2232
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
huge that it just seemed easy to say yeah

2233
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
that's obvious now with love it's like I'm

2234
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
slugging it out and

2235
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
we don't want to stand still basically

2236
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
like I said I was gonna wait till 300

2237
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
but I can't hold back

2238
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
yeah that's what it's a waste

2239
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
so what are the changes

2240
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
here's what I'm thinking now none of this

2241
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
is set in stone all of this is

2242
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
subject to change and it's gonna

2243
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
depend on if we can make it happen

2244
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
obviously

2245
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
but I think to keep

2246
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Unplugged competitive and to keep people

2247
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
enjoying the show

2248
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
we're gonna go to a full video

2249
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
show that's better produced than

2250
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
last ever was and we're gonna do that

2251
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
by making Unplugged an audio only

2252
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
show

2253
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
you following me

2254
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
we're gonna go we're gonna become a video

2255
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
show that was better produced than

2256
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Linux action show ever was

2257
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
and we're gonna do that by

2258
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
becoming an audio show

2259
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
an audio only show

2260
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
that's more edited

2261
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
it's closer to Linux action news as polish

2262
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
but with the chill vibe

2263
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
of Linux Unplugged and still live

2264
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
while being a full video show

2265
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
so that's what we're gonna do

2266
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
is this before or after we've invented that

2267
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
time travel

2268
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
so what we're gonna do is

2269
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
we're going to buy about a thousand dollars

2270
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
or more in camera equipment if we can get the support

2271
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
you know so we'll have a camera for me

2272
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
a camera for you a camera for a guest

2273
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
eventually if the beard ever goes on

2274
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
camera we'll have a camera for him

2275
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
and my intention is

2276
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
what I'm thinking is we'll release a full unedited

2277
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
video version behind the scenes

2278
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
sort of like if you're gonna watch

2279
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
like the Howard Stern show behind I don't know that's probably

2280
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
a bad example but I'm trying to think of some radio

2281
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
what are you setting us up for here?

2282
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
you and I will be on camera and we'll

2283
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
make that feed available to the patrons

2284
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
because we have the whole pipeline to do that

2285
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
we just have to add a couple of camera

2286
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
pieces of equipment and boom boom boom done

2287
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
and we've got the switcher we've got the

2288
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
production pipeline we've got the publishing platform

2289
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
we've got the download CDN everything

2290
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
we need to do that is in place

2291
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
but the thing I always hated about the Linux

2292
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
action show was we had a camera

2293
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
straight on and it was two people

2294
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
sitting in front of a table

2295
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
and not facing each other looking at a camera

2296
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
with studio lights on and it just creates

2297
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
a phony environment

2298
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
and the green screen didn't help and

2299
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
this would be you and I still sitting here

2300
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
across the table looking at each other in the eye

2301
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
doing this show

2302
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
lights off relaxed but people

2303
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
could just be here with us and

2304
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
when you're talking the camera would be on you when I'm talking

2305
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
camera on me etc. Are we gonna have to

2306
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
put pants on for this?

2307
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
No. This is for patrons.

2308
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Oh right. So then what we'll do with the wider

2309
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
audience we'll get a better sounding more polished

2310
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
product so we'll do multi track recording

2311
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
of some capacity I'm not there yet we may

2312
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
make changes in how we produce the virtual

2313
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
lug so we can improve the audio

2314
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
quality there.

2315
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
And that

2316
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
will be a show and we'll make small

2317
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
edits to that so that way like if there's

2318
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
some weird erroneous loud noise

2319
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
or a click or a clack or

2320
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
too much talking over each other we'll clean

2321
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
some of that up.

2322
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
And publish that as

2323
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
the standard show

2324
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
with well produced audio levels

2325
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
slightly tighter and cleaner production

2326
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
but not dramatically changed which

2327
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
would be the main show. And then if you want the

2328
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
behind the scenes version we'll have that completely

2329
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
unedited version that we have now.

2330
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
It'll be like you're just right here in the studio with us.

2331
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
And I think and so don't

2332
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
don't jump to conclusions about

2333
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
will the show change or anything like that because I think

2334
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
if all of this is implemented right

2335
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
all the things we like about the show will just be better

2336
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
and it won't be like

2337
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
this radical change to the show. In fact

2338
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
I could have gotten away without saying anything potentially

2339
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
but the wider audience should get a better

2340
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
sounding more polished product that's

2341
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
more competitive I think.

2342
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
And is easier to listen

2343
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
to. And the video version will have

2344
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
better production than the Linux action show ever had

2345
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
for those that really want it that still miss last.

2346
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
And the hardware investment would be our

2347
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
initial upfront cost but then after that we'd be just

2348
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
utilizing our existing production pipeline we're already

2349
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
pumped for so

2350
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
it's a pretty straightforward process

2351
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
for JB to implement. And I think it would make

2352
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
for a good show all around because those that want

2353
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
a really great audio show will get it and people

2354
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
that want to laid back

2355
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
sort of low key video show will get that too.

2356
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
A lot of flexibility. And we'll

2357
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
make some changes in how we record the

2358
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
individual microphones and mumble to make this

2359
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
all happen.

2360
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
But all of it will be for the better.

2361
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
So that's we're working towards that towards 250 now.

2362
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I think what we're going to do

2363
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
and we haven't made the official changes yet but I think

2364
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
what we're going to do is we're going to set a milestone

2365
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
on our Patreon page at patreon.com

2366
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
slash Jupiter signal for forty

2367
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
five hundred dollars.

2368
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
We have to change some of the milestone stuff right now.

2369
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
And we're going to work

2370
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
towards that because we're going to make the initial

2371
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
purchase for

2372
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
the cameras but then also

2373
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
we're going to either hire somebody

2374
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
or I'm going to or some

2375
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
somebody is going to be editing

2376
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
the audio version of the show.

2377
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
So that way it's a fully fledged

2378
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
well produced supported product.

2379
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
And so we're also going to be trying to raise

2380
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
funds to make that happen. And so that's

2381
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
why we're hoping that if people like this

2382
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
idea or just want to help

2383
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
us improve the production quality of the show they

2384
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
consider becoming a patron at patreon.com slash

2385
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Jupiter signal and then once you become one

2386
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
later on once the video version is published

2387
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
you would get access to that.

2388
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Which is really not too far

2389
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
away. It just takes time and cameras.

2390
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Yeah. All of which we

2391
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
can figure out but just

2392
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
going to take some financing. And

2393
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I know that all sounds like a lot

2394
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
but if you think about all the pieces we have

2395
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
in place it's actually all quite doable

2396
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
because the video can be produced

2397
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
on OBS. Yeah we have that.

2398
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
And that's that's running all the time.

2399
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
The audio can be recorded on a separate machine

2400
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
on a multi-track recorder

2401
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
that spits out FLAC files

2402
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
or WAV files or whatever

2403
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
that goes off to

2404
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Rekai or a dedicated audio editor or

2405
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
myself that then

2406
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
runs the production on that and publishes

2407
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
that as an MP3 and AUG or Web

2408
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
M or whatever crazy ass format people want.

2409
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Right. And that's that nothing really

2410
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
changes there. And

2411
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
the video version is already done because it's

2412
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
unedited. Yeah it's just a live OBS

2413
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
creates the file and then we upload

2414
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
that to Scale Engine we publish to the patrons

2415
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
and we're done. And

2416
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
we don't walk this weird awkward

2417
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
line anymore.

2418
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
It just takes us changing some hardware

2419
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
or actually adding some hardware

2420
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
and adding some staffing.

2421
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Yeah. Contract staffing likely.

2422
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
So it seems doable. So we're just

2423
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
we're going to we're going to we're going to try to get

2424
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
to a new milestone on Patreon

2425
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
to get there and I'm going to say I'm hoping we get there

2426
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
by 250.

2427
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
We'll see. What do you guys think? Am I crazy?

2428
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Everybody's good to me. No I like that idea.

2429
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I mean. Sounds good. Video

2430
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
can be fun. I like the like

2431
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
live unplugged aspect and it's I mean

2432
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
like we're hanging out here. It's a lot of fun. I think it would be fun to

2433
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
to kind of share that more.

2434
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
And also I've been loving land

2435
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
so there's certainly times

2436
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I would. And you've been on the other end of the actual production

2437
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
aspect of land which that means there's

2438
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
some there's other things there that we gain

2439
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
that are sort of like inside baseball but

2440
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
great from a production standpoint.

2441
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Which would be nice. Yeah.

2442
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
So here's my question.

2443
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Yes. You're going to be doing a nice

2444
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
audio focus show when you can

2445
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
upgrade me to an RE20. I know.

2446
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Maybe we'll do that when we get to the milestone as well.

2447
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Upgrade that microphone. Get you off the old stuff.

2448
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Yeah. That's people don't know

2449
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
because we don't have cameras in here. But Rekai's on this weird

2450
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
old mic that we used to use that

2451
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
we no longer use. But then when we set up two more

2452
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
additional chairs in the studio we had to pull out the old stuff.

2453
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
I missed the sexy bassiness

2454
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
of my voice. Yeah.

2455
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
When you do use here you sit on a different mic so it sounds like a

2456
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
different Rekai.

2457
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Well yeah. Then we'll work on that too.

2458
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
We'll work on that. All right.

2459
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
So if you have any thoughts

2460
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
I'd like to hear them. So go over to the usual

2461
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
places like jupiterbroadcasting.com

2462
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
slash contact or

2463
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
you can go to linuxunplug.reddit.com

2464
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
or if you're a patron

2465
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I'd really like to hear your thoughts at patreon.com slash

2466
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
jupiter signal.

2467
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
And before we go I want to give

2468
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
a plug to Mr. Popey's

2469
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Ubuntu podcast. Go check that out.

2470
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Always a great listen.

2471
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
See what I'm listening. Hold on. Let me promote my

2472
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
player right now. I'm listening to

2473
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
season 10 episode 31

2474
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
right now. So I just

2475
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
that's how I love the show. And you know what

2476
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
after seeing those guys

2477
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
after seeing those guys in New York

2478
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I realized I missed hanging out with them when I got back to

2479
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Washington. That's so sweet.

2480
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
So you want to hear my solution. It's not it's not it's

2481
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
not bulletproof but it's there it's getting there.

2482
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
You ready. Hey Siri.

2483
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
What are beans.

2484
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
A common name for large seeds

2485
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
of several genera of the flowering plant family

2486
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
of several genera of the flowering plant family

2487
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
for bacilli also known as leguminosi

2488
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
which are used for human or animal

2489
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
food. I've changed my

2490
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Siri voice to be quote unquote

2491
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
British.

2492
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
And now it's now I think you

2493
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
guys when Siri talks to me which is weird

2494
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
in a lot of ways when I think about it.

2495
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I think about it. Yeah. So check out the Ubuntu podcast

2496
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
and of course Ubuntu

2497
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
on air dot com on

2498
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Monday 1500 UTC

2499
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
for the ISO testing seems like

2500
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
a good cause seems like a very good

2501
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
cause. All right.

2502
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Absolutely. Thank you for being here. I think that's going to

2503
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
bring us to the end of this week. So is there anything else we want to cover.

2504
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
I was going to try to fit in the Gentoo review this week

2505
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
but I think we've kind of run out of time.

2506
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
So I guess we should probably punt that

2507
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
till next week. And you know who saw that

2508
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
coming. I didn't know. We don't want to distract

2509
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
people should be thinking about the show the future getting

2510
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
excited for it. So that's a perfect note to

2511
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
well and you know the Libra 15 reviews really the meat

2512
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
of the show. That was the focus this week. So I hate

2513
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
to talk about Gentoo and it hasn't been the primary

2514
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
focus. So I

2515
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
guess for this week we're going to punt it. I didn't

2516
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
