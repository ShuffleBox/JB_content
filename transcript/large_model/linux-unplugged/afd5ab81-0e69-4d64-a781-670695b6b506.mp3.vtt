WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.260
I got great news for anybody that's feeling retro right now.

00:03.260 --> 00:06.560
Linux's floppy disk support isn't just going away.

00:06.560 --> 00:09.200
No, no, it's getting better in 2020.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.200
Yeah, that's right.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.080
It doesn't make any sense,

00:11.080 --> 00:13.400
but the same kernel where Intel stabilized

00:13.400 --> 00:17.520
Tiger Lake graphics, AMD added support for Zen version three,

00:17.520 --> 00:22.000
and we got that new ex-fat driver, it's seen floppy work.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.240
I kind of love this.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.680
Yesterday, Wes and I were just talking

00:25.680 --> 00:28.320
about how I wanted to set up an LTO tape drive

00:28.320 --> 00:29.960
here in the studio and just start putting stuff

00:29.960 --> 00:30.800
on the LTO tape.

00:30.800 --> 00:31.640
Retro.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.000
But maybe this is a better way to go.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.660
And it's not just like keeping things kind of fresh.

00:36.660 --> 00:39.760
It's a full on bunch of code fixes,

00:39.760 --> 00:44.760
586 lines of new code and 613 deletions.

00:45.440 --> 00:46.960
Let's say you can tell it's good.

00:46.960 --> 00:51.960
Hello friends, welcome into Linux Unplugged episode 345,

00:51.960 --> 00:53.520
your weekly Linux talk show.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.360
My name is Chris.

00:54.360 --> 00:55.200
My name is Wes.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.560
Hello, Wes.

00:56.560 --> 00:59.200
We have a really fun show to get into today.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.320
Wes and I have been running Ubuntu 2004

01:02.320 --> 01:05.440
and GNOME 3.36, and we have many,

01:05.440 --> 01:07.240
many things to share with you.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.960
But also, I don't know if you can tell,

01:08.960 --> 01:10.720
I'm not in Denver this week.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.040
I'll tell you what happened.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.080
I was surprised to see you in the studio this morning.

01:14.080 --> 01:16.000
Crazy series of events.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.320
I'm not in Denver this week.

01:17.320 --> 01:18.160
I'm in the studio.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.000
I'm in the studio.

01:19.000 --> 01:19.840
I'm in the studio.

01:19.840 --> 01:20.680
I'm in the studio.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.680
Crazy series of events, which we will get into in a moment.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.840
We've got a bunch of community news,

01:25.840 --> 01:27.920
and we're gonna go behind the scenes

01:27.920 --> 01:31.520
of the just completed WSLConf,

01:31.520 --> 01:33.120
the first of the tech conferences

01:33.120 --> 01:35.520
to pivot to virtual only in the light

01:35.520 --> 01:37.440
of all of the recent healthcare stuff.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.120
They were really at the forefront of that,

01:39.120 --> 01:40.560
and so it makes for a fascinating story.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.440
But before we get into that,

01:42.440 --> 01:45.480
I got a couple of bits of business to get into.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.080
Time appropriate greetings, virtual log.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.200
Hello, hello.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.040
Hello, hello.

01:49.040 --> 01:49.880
Hello, hello.

01:49.880 --> 01:50.600
Howdy.

01:50.600 --> 01:51.440
Hello.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.800
Happy Linux Tuesday.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.920
Yes, that is a great showing.

01:54.920 --> 01:55.760
Hello, everybody.

01:55.760 --> 01:56.600
There's so many in there.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.440
I'm gonna do it.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.280
Are you ready, Russ?

01:58.280 --> 01:59.120
I'm gonna do it.

01:59.120 --> 01:59.960
Come on.

01:59.960 --> 02:03.360
Hello to Anthr, Byte, Carl, Conan, Emaxer, Frank,

02:03.360 --> 02:07.480
Jill, John, Colonel, Kestras, Minimac, TechMav,

02:07.480 --> 02:10.000
and all of you up in the quiet listening

02:10.000 --> 02:12.560
who are just hanging out and listening.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.200
We have 20 people in there this week,

02:14.200 --> 02:17.440
and it is awesome, but of course,

02:17.440 --> 02:19.240
in studio with us rocking, as always,

02:19.240 --> 02:22.600
in the corner in the big comfy chair is Mr. Cheese Bacon.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.440
Hello, sir.

02:23.440 --> 02:24.760
Hello, everyone.

02:24.760 --> 02:27.520
It's great to see that we have the continued turnout

02:27.520 --> 02:28.360
each week.

02:28.360 --> 02:29.600
It just seems to be getting bigger and bigger

02:29.600 --> 02:30.600
and bigger and bigger every week.

02:30.600 --> 02:31.440
It's awesome.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.280
I know.

02:32.280 --> 02:34.280
One of the reasons I came back a little early

02:34.280 --> 02:36.680
was because I was thinking everybody's at home.

02:36.680 --> 02:37.760
Yeah, if you're hunkered down at home,

02:37.760 --> 02:39.160
why not hang out virtually?

02:39.160 --> 02:41.040
They're gonna show up, and it's gonna be a big show,

02:41.040 --> 02:41.880
and it is.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.160
We have a big chat room going right now.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.360
Hello, everybody.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.800
We've got a lot going on in the mumble room.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.560
Before we get into why I'm not in Denver,

02:49.560 --> 02:52.120
how about a couple of fun floppy facts, Westpain?

02:52.120 --> 02:54.880
You want to razzle dazzle us with a few fun floppy facts?

02:54.880 --> 02:56.200
Floppy facts.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.360
Razzle dazzle us, sir.

02:57.360 --> 03:02.360
A blank CD would take roughly 487 floppy disks.

03:02.840 --> 03:03.680
Okay.

03:03.680 --> 03:04.840
That's the size comparison.

03:04.840 --> 03:07.560
It's not as big as I thought, really.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.040
CDs aren't that great.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.600
Yeah, but when you're installing an operating system,

03:11.600 --> 03:13.480
it really makes all the difference.

03:13.480 --> 03:15.600
Yeah, it gets a little better when you go up a level.

03:15.600 --> 03:20.080
A blank DVD would take roughly 3,264 floppies.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.200
Could you imagine watching a movie

03:22.200 --> 03:25.360
and then pausing to swap a disk or something like that?

03:25.360 --> 03:28.760
It might look nice on the shelf, though,

03:28.760 --> 03:30.680
just you have to have so many laying around.

03:30.680 --> 03:33.080
Oh, yeah, especially if the labels

03:33.080 --> 03:34.480
could all complete a picture

03:34.480 --> 03:36.000
when they're all lined up next to each other.

03:36.000 --> 03:36.840
Now you're thinking.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.720
Yeah, that'd look really good.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.160
What about a big disk?

03:40.160 --> 03:43.320
Yeah, okay, well, a single one-derabyte drive,

03:43.320 --> 03:47.320
that's nearly 700,000 floppies.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.280
You know what was interesting about the code cleanup

03:49.280 --> 03:52.240
is that some of it was specifically

03:52.240 --> 03:54.280
for ARM support of floppy disks.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.400
So ARM devices are getting floppy drives?

03:57.400 --> 03:59.560
I'll admit, that's not anything I've ever tried.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.200
No, that's not where I expected that to go.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.760
But, I mean, why not?

04:03.760 --> 04:05.080
If you're using it somewhere mobile

04:05.080 --> 04:07.720
or in the field, IoT-based perhaps,

04:07.720 --> 04:10.320
you don't need that much storage and floppies are around.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.480
There are still some legacy applications

04:12.480 --> 04:13.600
and equipment out there.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.400
I'm looking at you, old-timey oscilloscopes

04:15.400 --> 04:17.960
that only output by floppy.

04:17.960 --> 04:19.760
So I wonder how many people are here for the first time.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.520
I think, Anther, you're here for the first time

04:21.520 --> 04:22.360
working from home.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.600
Welcome to the Virtual Lug.

04:23.600 --> 04:24.440
Thank you.

04:24.440 --> 04:25.760
Glad to have you here.

04:25.760 --> 04:26.600
Who else?

04:26.600 --> 04:29.080
Anybody else in the Virtual Lug this week

04:29.080 --> 04:30.000
joining us for the first time

04:30.000 --> 04:31.040
because they're working from home?

04:31.040 --> 04:31.880
That'd be me.

04:31.880 --> 04:32.800
Welcome.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.120
Awesome, I'm glad you made this on your list.

04:35.120 --> 04:35.960
I'm glad it worked for you.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.800
And shout out to everybody in the chat room, too,

04:38.800 --> 04:40.360
who is joining us for the first time.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.960
And if you didn't know, podcasting

04:41.960 --> 04:44.000
and listening to podcasts, it makes you more productive.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.600
Yeah, and welcome to the low latency feed of the show.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.280
So why am I here?

04:49.280 --> 04:51.920
Why am I one of those low latency contributors?

04:51.920 --> 04:53.880
Because as you may have seen,

04:53.880 --> 04:57.760
elementary OS folks had to cancel their sprint

04:57.760 --> 05:02.080
because of all of the COVID-19 restrictions and concerns.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.480
And of course, just safety precautions.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.480
And they had team members who would have been traveling

05:05.480 --> 05:07.360
from Europe and they just wouldn't have been able

05:07.360 --> 05:08.200
to get back.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.160
So those minor details.

05:10.160 --> 05:13.440
Funny enough, though, and they told me as soon as they knew,

05:13.440 --> 05:14.920
the guys told me immediately,

05:14.920 --> 05:19.920
I found out the evening before I was getting ready to leave,

05:20.160 --> 05:23.520
I was already packed up, ready to go, everything was set.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.800
And so I decided to head out anyways.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.040
Yeah, I mean, you're ready to go.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.400
Yeah, I mean, I coordinated with work and you,

05:29.400 --> 05:32.000
like we were planning for me to be remote.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.640
Angela had decided that she could watch the kids

05:35.640 --> 05:36.480
while we were gone.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.360
And we had arranged some friends

05:38.360 --> 05:39.360
to also help watch the kids.

05:39.360 --> 05:40.440
And we made time.

05:40.440 --> 05:44.400
Like it had sort of worked out just sort of beautifully.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.880
And I thought, okay, let's go anyways

05:45.880 --> 05:47.400
because this time is available.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.880
Wow, did that turn into an adventure.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.040
There was a winter storm that rolled

05:53.040 --> 05:55.900
into the Pacific Northwest that chased me around.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.680
And so I decided because I figured we'd have a good showing

05:59.680 --> 06:01.000
that I should just try to come back

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
and try to make it back by Tuesday,

06:03.000 --> 06:05.620
which turned into an incredible adventure itself,

06:05.620 --> 06:08.460
which since we're here to talk about Linux,

06:08.460 --> 06:10.900
I will spare you all from,

06:10.900 --> 06:13.420
but you can find it at worklifeandrv.com.

06:13.420 --> 06:15.860
It's episode four, eager beavers versus the storm.

06:15.860 --> 06:17.500
We'll have a link in the show notes.

06:17.500 --> 06:20.220
I tell you what, I thought I'd go work from the road

06:20.220 --> 06:23.060
for a week or two and then come back all refreshed

06:23.060 --> 06:24.540
and recharged.

06:24.540 --> 06:29.020
And it ended up being essentially a struggle to survive

06:29.020 --> 06:31.440
and also not crash my home.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.380
It was a hell of a journey.

06:34.380 --> 06:35.700
And in the meantime,

06:35.700 --> 06:38.460
the elementary OS guys got together virtually.

06:38.460 --> 06:41.140
They started working on a few different goals.

06:41.140 --> 06:42.620
It's not necessarily the same thing.

06:42.620 --> 06:44.460
I mean, a pandemic is not gonna stop them.

06:44.460 --> 06:45.940
No, and they've already made some improvements

06:45.940 --> 06:47.740
and contributions.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.300
Daniel Foray and Cassidy have been tweeting

06:50.300 --> 06:51.340
about some of their improvements.

06:51.340 --> 06:53.940
So I invited them to come on the show after they're done

06:53.940 --> 06:54.900
and tell us where they got,

06:54.900 --> 06:58.300
but maybe they might reschedule this to an in-person thing.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.940
We just don't know at this time.

06:59.940 --> 07:01.500
It's all up in the air.

07:01.500 --> 07:05.060
Also, since we've gotten together last, Linux Fest Northwest

07:05.060 --> 07:07.180
is officially canceled.

07:07.180 --> 07:09.580
So obviously we won't be making it to Linux Fest Northwest

07:09.580 --> 07:10.420
this year.

07:10.420 --> 07:11.980
We need a sad clip for that.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.940
Oh man, it's a bit of a blow, huh?

07:14.940 --> 07:16.420
It is, it really sucks.

07:18.900 --> 07:22.200
Yeah, yeah, especially after not making it to scale.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.040
I'm not sure.

07:23.040 --> 07:25.300
I'm kind of postulating what I might do,

07:25.300 --> 07:27.080
maybe a mini meetup because there are some folks

07:27.080 --> 07:29.580
that just already have travel plans locked in.

07:29.580 --> 07:33.580
And it really all just depends on where the pandemic is

07:33.580 --> 07:34.740
by that point.

07:34.740 --> 07:36.860
I've been talking about it on the Chris Last cast

07:36.860 --> 07:39.060
and I'll probably just keep people posted that way.

07:39.060 --> 07:41.260
I kind of look at that as,

07:41.260 --> 07:43.380
it's almost like my personal newsletter,

07:43.380 --> 07:47.460
only I would write a horrible newsletter, let's be honest.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.020
Could you imagine how atrocious that would be?

07:49.020 --> 07:51.900
I'd kind of like to see it, but no, no, podcasts are better.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.780
Yeah, I just, I do a lot better verbally.

07:53.780 --> 07:56.900
So I'm just kind of keeping everyone posted on my plans,

07:56.900 --> 07:59.260
what I'm doing off air and that kind of stuff

07:59.260 --> 08:00.100
at the Chris Last cast.

08:00.100 --> 08:05.100
So if I end up doing a Linux fest sort of pirate meetup

08:05.540 --> 08:06.380
or something like that.

08:06.380 --> 08:07.980
Escape to Ballynam.

08:07.980 --> 08:10.460
I'll keep everybody posted there, but I may not.

08:10.460 --> 08:13.100
I mean, if this thing, if the health situation continues

08:13.100 --> 08:15.500
to get worse and worse, we'll see.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.340
We'll see, we're just gonna play it by ear.

08:17.340 --> 08:18.980
Why don't we talk about some great news,

08:18.980 --> 08:22.660
assuming that manufacturing isn't too much of-

08:22.660 --> 08:23.500
Impacted.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.960
Yeah, like that could always change things here,

08:24.960 --> 08:28.620
but it looks like we're gonna see a new Pinebook Pro run.

08:28.620 --> 08:32.100
And this time they'll ship with Manjaro KDE edition

08:32.100 --> 08:35.500
as the default operating system and pre-orders

08:35.500 --> 08:40.500
as we record will go live tomorrow, March 18th, 2020

08:40.620 --> 08:44.180
for early shipping in May.

08:44.180 --> 08:46.300
What do you think about the choice of Manjaro

08:46.300 --> 08:49.700
as the distribution of choice on the Pinebook?

08:49.700 --> 08:52.420
It's kind of unexpected to me, but I like it.

08:52.420 --> 08:54.660
Honestly, it seems like one of the few options

08:54.660 --> 08:55.780
I might actually keep around

08:55.780 --> 08:58.580
without immediately reflashing after I got one.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.260
All right, that's a pretty fair point

09:00.260 --> 09:02.740
if you're talking about you and I personally, right?

09:02.740 --> 09:03.860
What about you, Cheezy?

09:03.860 --> 09:06.340
Personally, I'm a huge fan of Manjaro

09:06.340 --> 09:08.820
and I've been using it on the Pinebook

09:08.820 --> 09:12.340
since I think it was, well, I've tested all of the betas.

09:12.340 --> 09:15.320
So the initial build and now I think it was beta three

09:15.320 --> 09:16.740
was the last one that I've installed

09:16.740 --> 09:18.340
and it's still currently running.

09:19.580 --> 09:21.820
And I paired that with, because it is the KDE version,

09:21.820 --> 09:24.580
I paired that with a lot of the tips and tricks

09:24.580 --> 09:26.540
that you had given whenever we did

09:26.540 --> 09:29.940
the basic to brilliant video.

09:29.940 --> 09:31.100
Oh yeah, the plasma livestream.

09:31.100 --> 09:32.420
Yeah, the plasma livestream.

09:32.420 --> 09:34.780
So to me, it's that perfect little machine

09:34.780 --> 09:37.140
that I reach for when I'm just kicking it on the couch,

09:37.140 --> 09:40.740
laying in bed, you know, checking out my OctoPrint server,

09:40.740 --> 09:43.820
just see how my 3D printer's going or something, right?

09:43.820 --> 09:45.340
It's perfect little machine for that.

09:45.340 --> 09:46.580
Yeah, good point.

09:47.460 --> 09:51.300
And it is also kind of a cutting edge device.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.740
So having an operating system that stays very current

09:53.740 --> 09:55.700
and has the latest upstream drivers.

09:55.700 --> 09:56.580
Seems like a nice idea.

09:56.580 --> 09:58.500
Yeah, TechMav, I'm curious, what do you think,

09:58.500 --> 10:00.020
if you look at Manjaro and you look at them

10:00.020 --> 10:02.660
sort of expanding their focus into Pinebooks,

10:02.660 --> 10:03.880
does this make sense?

10:03.880 --> 10:08.880
I personally use the Manjaro KDE plasma on my Pinebook Pro.

10:09.180 --> 10:10.020
I love it.

10:10.020 --> 10:11.140
I mean, it stays up to date.

10:11.140 --> 10:12.500
It's minimal problem.

10:12.500 --> 10:17.220
I run off of a 128 gigabyte micro SD card.

10:17.220 --> 10:19.820
I prefer it much better than the default

10:19.820 --> 10:23.140
Debian mix match it did.

10:23.140 --> 10:28.140
I still think that this product has a wider ability

10:28.980 --> 10:33.260
if we can just put all those tiny little pieces together

10:33.260 --> 10:36.540
between the community and the businesses.

10:36.540 --> 10:41.540
I think an Ubuntu install being optioned for it

10:41.700 --> 10:44.180
would be just a great place for education.

10:44.180 --> 10:45.660
I mean, great price point.

10:45.660 --> 10:49.280
Try to put community together with something like Landscape

10:49.280 --> 10:51.900
or some of the other management systems out there.

10:51.900 --> 10:56.060
Like an Ubuntu 2004 machine that is managed by Landscape

10:56.060 --> 10:58.780
and set up as a package for education.

10:58.780 --> 11:00.240
This can knock out Chromebook.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.080
Yeah, I could see that.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.180
I could see that.

11:02.180 --> 11:04.580
Anthony, what do you think about the price though?

11:04.580 --> 11:06.700
Is this the right device for the money

11:06.700 --> 11:09.980
when you could go on eBay, you could spend two to 300 bucks

11:09.980 --> 11:12.700
and you could get a pretty great x86 ThinkPad?

11:12.700 --> 11:13.820
Yeah, I agree.

11:13.820 --> 11:17.500
I usually use an x270 for the couch machine

11:17.500 --> 11:20.180
and a little remote terminal server,

11:20.180 --> 11:23.540
but opening up a Pinebook with that good power efficiency

11:23.540 --> 11:27.540
and brand new plastic is appealing.

11:27.540 --> 11:29.380
I do like the idea of power efficiency,

11:29.380 --> 11:32.300
especially for my, I'm sitting at the couch surfing machine.

11:32.300 --> 11:33.940
The thing that stays in your bag all day,

11:33.940 --> 11:34.820
you just know it'll be on.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.340
You never know when you might need the machine

11:36.340 --> 11:37.740
and the Pinebook Pro fits that.

11:37.740 --> 11:39.480
Sort of the iPad roll for me right now

11:39.480 --> 11:41.300
where I just need a really quick go-to,

11:41.300 --> 11:43.460
always has battery life machine.

11:43.460 --> 11:45.700
Colonel, you think maybe there's some concerns

11:45.700 --> 11:47.180
about the power behind this thing

11:47.180 --> 11:49.140
and building packages from the AUR?

11:49.140 --> 11:50.980
Yeah, my only concern would be

11:50.980 --> 11:54.580
if there's a lot of packages that may not be available.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.900
So people build them from the AUR

11:56.900 --> 12:00.640
and does the Pinebook have the horsepower

12:00.640 --> 12:03.840
and the RAM and et cetera to be building those packages

12:03.840 --> 12:05.580
every time you run your updates?

12:05.580 --> 12:06.680
Sure, that's a good question.

12:06.680 --> 12:08.820
And then Mini-Mac, you have a question too

12:08.820 --> 12:09.780
that's sort of related

12:09.780 --> 12:11.120
that I think Cheese could probably answer.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.220
Why don't you go ahead Mini-Mac?

12:12.220 --> 12:17.220
Yeah, my crucial thing on the new couch computer laptop

12:17.380 --> 12:18.700
would be the speakers.

12:18.700 --> 12:21.540
So just watching a YouTube video like that,

12:21.540 --> 12:25.660
you need some speakers that have some quite good sounds.

12:25.660 --> 12:27.980
So how are the speakers?

12:27.980 --> 12:29.500
Not good at all.

12:30.380 --> 12:31.220
To be quite honest.

12:31.220 --> 12:32.880
Ah, that's so sad.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.100
The speakers are pretty horrible.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.680
There have been a few people on the forums

12:37.680 --> 12:40.420
that have modded them and replaced the speakers

12:40.420 --> 12:42.080
and they've gotten a few more DB out of them

12:42.080 --> 12:44.860
and stuff like that, but they're still not great

12:44.860 --> 12:46.500
because they are down firing too.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.900
So let's say if you're relaxing with it on your lap,

12:49.900 --> 12:52.900
as people do with laptops,

12:52.900 --> 12:55.060
then the speakers are gonna be down firing.

12:55.060 --> 12:56.900
What I normally do is I pair that

12:56.900 --> 12:59.140
with a set of Bluetooth headphones

12:59.140 --> 13:02.380
and I haven't had any problems in that regard.

13:02.380 --> 13:06.020
But personally, another reason that I choose Manjaro

13:06.020 --> 13:08.820
is simply because the availability of packages,

13:08.820 --> 13:12.220
as Neil had stated, there are so many more packages

13:12.220 --> 13:15.620
available in the Manjaro repos.

13:15.620 --> 13:19.700
So one of the things, for example, was Telegram.

13:19.700 --> 13:22.500
I could snap the Telegram down,

13:22.500 --> 13:24.020
but then it was an outdated version

13:24.020 --> 13:26.500
and would crash any time someone dropped a GIF

13:26.500 --> 13:29.780
into a channel, so.

13:29.780 --> 13:31.340
That makes it like triple annoying.

13:31.340 --> 13:32.180
Yeah, exactly.

13:32.180 --> 13:34.260
So you don't know if it's this new hardware

13:34.260 --> 13:35.100
or what's going on.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.300
So, but as soon as I switched over Manjaro

13:37.300 --> 13:39.500
and then pulled down their build,

13:39.500 --> 13:42.580
which is the latest build of Telegram, I had no problem.

13:42.580 --> 13:45.020
So I think it's a smart decision for them

13:45.020 --> 13:48.020
to use Manjaro to ship these with.

13:48.020 --> 13:50.220
Especially if they're working together,

13:50.220 --> 13:53.500
even any kind of degree on the phone aspect

13:53.500 --> 13:54.700
of the PinePhone as well.

13:55.660 --> 13:58.380
You could see sort of the cross-pollination benefits here.

13:58.380 --> 14:01.260
And to Wes's original point,

14:01.260 --> 14:03.140
this would be a distribution that was shipped on this

14:03.140 --> 14:04.580
that I would probably keep.

14:04.580 --> 14:06.700
I mean, I would absolutely love to be able

14:06.700 --> 14:10.700
to just have an image I could download of Ubuntu 2004

14:10.700 --> 14:12.180
and run that when that's released.

14:12.180 --> 14:13.340
Oh yeah.

14:13.340 --> 14:16.260
But I love Manjaro as a workstation OS,

14:16.260 --> 14:18.100
especially on something like this that,

14:18.100 --> 14:19.660
like Neil made the point,

14:19.660 --> 14:22.220
really benefits from cutting edge upstream drivers.

14:22.220 --> 14:23.580
I think it was just weird at first

14:23.580 --> 14:27.220
to see an arch-based distro coming on a laptop.

14:27.220 --> 14:29.580
And then I think back to those arguments

14:29.580 --> 14:32.140
that we used to have about rolling versus long-term support.

14:32.140 --> 14:34.420
And that version of me is like, yes.

14:34.420 --> 14:35.820
Like that victory kid meme.

14:35.820 --> 14:38.940
And then now the older version of me is like,

14:38.940 --> 14:41.020
I don't know about this.

14:41.020 --> 14:43.140
So we'll just watch where this goes.

14:43.140 --> 14:47.860
But I think the one takeaway from this is it's great.

14:47.860 --> 14:48.940
Actually, there's a couple of takeaways.

14:48.940 --> 14:51.420
It's great for Manjaro, good on them.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.860
I'm really proud might not be the right word,

14:53.860 --> 14:56.740
but I am really pleased to see them continue to work

14:56.740 --> 14:58.620
with different industry players

14:58.620 --> 15:02.340
that seem like they have similar interests

15:02.340 --> 15:04.580
as the Manjaro core audience.

15:04.580 --> 15:05.420
Absolutely.

15:05.420 --> 15:06.980
Very intuitive, very clever of them.

15:06.980 --> 15:08.780
And it seems like a sign of maturity

15:08.780 --> 15:10.300
of the project itself as well.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.660
And I think all of those same things

15:12.660 --> 15:16.100
can be said about the Pine folks for recognizing Manjaro

15:16.100 --> 15:18.420
as a potential partner to work with.

15:18.420 --> 15:19.700
It's good.

15:19.700 --> 15:23.060
It's a good sign that these two,

15:23.060 --> 15:25.380
I guess you could call them companies now,

15:25.380 --> 15:28.540
but really it's projects, are getting their core audience.

15:28.540 --> 15:29.620
And can grow together.

15:29.620 --> 15:30.980
Mm-hmm.

15:30.980 --> 15:33.420
Okay, now I'm actually, now I love it.

15:33.420 --> 15:35.740
The worst part about this is it's going back,

15:35.740 --> 15:37.740
I have to think about ordering one.

15:37.740 --> 15:39.580
I know, yeah.

15:39.580 --> 15:40.740
Cheesy, you still recommend it?

15:40.740 --> 15:41.580
What do you think?

15:41.580 --> 15:42.820
If you're gonna spend the money,

15:42.820 --> 15:44.500
say you get a little tax return money or something,

15:44.500 --> 15:45.900
would you spend it on that?

15:45.900 --> 15:49.140
Yeah, if you're debating a Chromebook or a Pinebook,

15:49.140 --> 15:50.420
I would say go with a Pinebook.

15:50.420 --> 15:51.380
All right.

15:51.380 --> 15:55.500
If you're debating a decent little ThinkPad

15:55.500 --> 15:58.580
that might be a little bit over 200 bucks or a Pinebook,

15:58.580 --> 15:59.860
I would say go with the ThinkPad.

15:59.860 --> 16:00.700
Yeah.

16:00.700 --> 16:01.540
So I have both.

16:01.540 --> 16:05.660
I have a T440 ThinkPad that I use,

16:05.660 --> 16:08.620
and I mainly use that for the 3D printing stuff

16:08.620 --> 16:09.460
that I've been doing lately,

16:09.460 --> 16:11.380
so modeling and that sort of stuff.

16:11.380 --> 16:13.740
And then whenever I'm done with that,

16:13.740 --> 16:16.020
that goes down and I pick up the Pinebook.

16:16.020 --> 16:16.980
I get it.

16:16.980 --> 16:20.100
I always like to ask Jill sort of the long-term perspective

16:20.100 --> 16:23.300
because she and I have been watching this stuff for so long.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.500
This seems like a pretty clever partnership,

16:25.500 --> 16:26.340
doesn't it, Jill?

16:26.340 --> 16:28.020
Oh, most definitely.

16:28.020 --> 16:30.660
And you know, I think it's also a really good source

16:30.660 --> 16:32.540
of revenue for Manjaro.

16:32.540 --> 16:34.520
So it's a win-win.

16:34.520 --> 16:35.360
Great point.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.860
Nobody's brought up the money aspect of it,

16:36.860 --> 16:39.380
but this makes the project more sustainable

16:39.380 --> 16:41.220
and probably gonna sell a few Pinebooks.

16:41.220 --> 16:42.580
So they're gonna make some money too.

16:42.580 --> 16:43.420
Right.

16:43.420 --> 16:46.860
Well, and then isn't the Manjaro also shipping

16:46.860 --> 16:48.140
with some other hardware vendors

16:48.140 --> 16:49.660
out of Europe right now as well?

16:49.660 --> 16:52.060
Those guys are killing it.

16:52.060 --> 16:54.120
Yeah, and there's more to come.

16:55.020 --> 16:56.580
I just don't know if right now is the right time

16:56.580 --> 16:57.460
for me to talk about it,

16:57.460 --> 16:59.900
but there's more hardware in the works.

16:59.900 --> 17:00.740
Oh.

17:00.740 --> 17:02.220
Yeah, they got more stuff going on.

17:02.220 --> 17:03.040
Yeah.

17:03.040 --> 17:04.620
Let's talk about another sale though.

17:04.620 --> 17:07.660
This one I'm definitely still processing.

17:07.660 --> 17:11.660
And I think even the wording of the announcement

17:11.660 --> 17:16.100
has my conspiracy bacon tentacles tingling.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.300
I'm excited for this.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.960
I got tingling tentacles, Wes.

17:20.060 --> 17:22.920
NPM is joining GitHub.

17:24.380 --> 17:27.420
NPM is joining GitHub.

17:27.420 --> 17:29.260
There's something missing in that title, right?

17:29.260 --> 17:32.220
Yeah, comma also means Microsoft.

17:32.220 --> 17:33.060
Yeah.

17:33.060 --> 17:38.060
Which immediately, now I think GitHub

17:38.060 --> 17:42.100
has done really well under Microsoft's leadership.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.060
And I think that is really,

17:44.060 --> 17:45.520
I think you attribute a lot of that to Nat.

17:45.520 --> 17:49.100
I think Nat has really had a steady hand with all of this.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.300
And he is in a sense with this announcement

17:51.300 --> 17:53.420
taking a leadership role here,

17:53.420 --> 17:54.940
a very public leadership role.

17:54.940 --> 17:57.500
And so I think that's part of the framing of this message.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.300
Instead of saying Microsoft, they're saying GitHub,

17:59.300 --> 18:01.000
because what they're really saying is Nat.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.340
And that GitHub is still operating as its own

18:03.340 --> 18:04.900
sort of entity within Microsoft.

18:04.900 --> 18:06.240
And from some of the things I've read,

18:06.240 --> 18:07.460
it sounds like if anything,

18:07.460 --> 18:09.860
Microsoft has been adopting some of the GitHubisms

18:09.860 --> 18:11.260
more so than the reverse.

18:11.260 --> 18:14.180
Yeah, I mean, I'm well into this now.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.020
And I can't sit here and think of a single thing

18:16.020 --> 18:17.780
they've screwed up.

18:17.780 --> 18:21.580
But I wonder if the wording of this announcement

18:21.580 --> 18:25.060
isn't still trying to be super sensitive to that concern.

18:25.060 --> 18:29.580
Because the idea of Microsoft owning NPM sits,

18:29.580 --> 18:30.780
let's just practice for a moment.

18:30.780 --> 18:33.460
Do you wanna do like a thought experiment with me

18:33.460 --> 18:34.460
for a second here, Wes?

18:34.460 --> 18:35.300
Yeah, let's do it.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.700
Let's pretend like we could rewrite reality

18:37.700 --> 18:42.700
and that we're reading an entirely different news headline.

18:42.880 --> 18:43.720
You ready?

18:43.720 --> 18:47.780
This is CNN Breaking News.

18:47.780 --> 18:49.820
Breaking News, as we're recording, Wes,

18:49.820 --> 18:54.260
NPM has been acquired by Microsoft.

18:54.260 --> 18:55.960
Sounds a little different, doesn't it?

18:55.960 --> 18:59.420
Microsoft now owns and controls NPM.

18:59.420 --> 19:00.500
That sounds a little bit different.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.340
It does.

19:01.340 --> 19:04.820
However, when you say NPM is joining GitHub,

19:04.820 --> 19:05.860
that's not so bad.

19:05.860 --> 19:06.700
And I just think the wording-

19:06.700 --> 19:08.020
Oh, they're teaming up, oh great.

19:08.020 --> 19:10.340
The wording there is choice.

19:10.340 --> 19:11.620
But I think it's pretty intentional

19:11.620 --> 19:14.120
because they're trying to say,

19:14.120 --> 19:15.180
look at what we've done here.

19:15.180 --> 19:17.820
We've had a steady hand, we'll have a steady hand with NPM.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.020
I think that's the message.

19:19.020 --> 19:20.460
And for millions of developers

19:20.460 --> 19:23.200
who use the public NPM registry every day,

19:23.200 --> 19:24.620
there's not a lot that will change.

19:24.620 --> 19:26.060
In fact, I think they'll go out of their way

19:26.060 --> 19:30.600
to make sure what you expect to remain free stays free.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.660
In fact, Nat writes on the blog,

19:32.660 --> 19:35.460
our focus after the deal closes will be to,

19:35.460 --> 19:36.880
we've got three items,

19:36.880 --> 19:39.580
invest in registry infrastructure and platform.

19:39.580 --> 19:41.320
Who doesn't like hearing that?

19:41.320 --> 19:43.220
Improve the core experience.

19:43.220 --> 19:46.080
He writes, we will work to improve the everyday experience

19:46.080 --> 19:48.140
of developers and maintainers.

19:48.140 --> 19:50.260
And number three, gotta have this,

19:50.260 --> 19:53.760
gotta have this, engage with the community.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.240
We will actively engage with the JavaScript community

19:56.240 --> 20:00.160
to get your ideas and help us to find the future of NPM.

20:00.160 --> 20:03.400
Looking further ahead, we'll integrate GitHub and NPM

20:03.400 --> 20:04.440
to improve the security

20:04.440 --> 20:07.520
of the open source software supply chain.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.880
Okay, that sounds pretty nebulous, but I like this part.

20:09.880 --> 20:12.920
And enable you to trace a change from a GitHub pull request

20:12.920 --> 20:15.240
to the NPM package version that fixed it.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.080
And to their credit, I mean,

20:16.080 --> 20:17.400
they have been adding a lot of, you know,

20:17.400 --> 20:18.960
vulnerability scanning and tools

20:18.960 --> 20:21.480
to assess open source projects, which is great.

20:21.480 --> 20:26.160
Yeah, I find that to be a uniquely actionable item.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.160
In an otherwise pretty high level document.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.320
Yes, and not something you generally see

20:30.320 --> 20:31.920
in this type of announcement.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.920
And that's like, this is a specific thing

20:33.920 --> 20:35.400
we are going to execute on.

20:35.400 --> 20:39.680
And to allow somebody like a developer

20:39.680 --> 20:41.920
who is trying to figure out if this is a safe thing

20:41.920 --> 20:44.400
to incorporate into an overall project,

20:44.400 --> 20:46.960
to trace it all the way back to a GitHub pull request

20:46.960 --> 20:49.640
to make sure that things are fixed, that's a big deal.

20:49.640 --> 20:52.440
That's actually something I would love to see

20:52.440 --> 20:54.280
just from a show research standpoint.

20:54.280 --> 20:56.800
I mean, we know the NPM ecosystem

20:56.800 --> 20:59.160
could do with some improved security.

20:59.160 --> 21:01.200
Linux headlines, not show.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.480
Okay, so what about paying customers of NPM?

21:03.480 --> 21:04.720
Because if you remember, I mean,

21:04.720 --> 21:07.240
this was a business here that got purchased.

21:07.240 --> 21:08.880
They say they're investing heavily

21:08.880 --> 21:10.720
in improving GitHub packages,

21:10.720 --> 21:13.440
which is the package system built into GitHub.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.160
Later this year, we'll enable NPM's paying customers

21:17.160 --> 21:21.000
to move their private NPM packages to GitHub packages.

21:21.000 --> 21:26.000
Although they say, allowing NPM to exclusively focus

21:26.080 --> 21:28.880
on being a great public registry for JavaScript.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.520
So if you're a paying customer,

21:30.520 --> 21:31.520
sounds like you're getting rolled

21:31.520 --> 21:33.640
into the GitHub version of these things.

21:33.640 --> 21:36.840
NPM public stand put for the time being?

21:36.840 --> 21:38.320
That's how I read it.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.440
So I was curious if that's how you read it.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.360
I think that makes sense.

21:41.360 --> 21:45.760
I think I see that all changing in about 12 months.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.880
That seems like they're gonna redo all of this.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.240
There's something brewing here.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.080
When you look at the whole picture

21:51.080 --> 21:55.240
of checking in your code, publishing somewhere,

21:55.240 --> 21:57.240
putting it up online via Azure services,

21:57.240 --> 22:00.400
there's something really kind of coalescing here

22:00.400 --> 22:02.120
that I don't fully appreciate yet,

22:02.120 --> 22:02.960
but I can see the edges of it.

22:02.960 --> 22:03.800
I also think about this.

22:03.800 --> 22:07.040
Think about outdated Internet Explorer,

22:07.040 --> 22:09.120
the bad one with not supporting

22:09.120 --> 22:10.760
the latest JavaScript standards

22:10.760 --> 22:13.200
or any of the latest standards.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.760
To now the world where Microsoft

22:14.760 --> 22:18.080
like made TypeScript and owns NPM.

22:18.080 --> 22:20.120
And it's like this major JavaScript player

22:20.120 --> 22:22.960
and VS Code, which is a huge editor in that ecosystem.

22:22.960 --> 22:24.120
Yeah.

22:24.120 --> 22:24.960
Wild.

22:24.960 --> 22:25.880
Yeah, it is.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.760
And of course, you and I are coming off of WSL Conf

22:28.760 --> 22:31.560
where we watch people write Linux applications on Windows

22:31.560 --> 22:34.560
and run XFCE on top of Windows 10.

22:34.560 --> 22:37.400
Crazy.

22:37.400 --> 22:38.240
It really has been-

22:38.240 --> 22:39.080
2020.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.480
Yeah, 2020 has been nuts for us so far,

22:41.480 --> 22:44.840
which we'll get more into here in just a moment.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.240
I think this is one of those stories

22:46.240 --> 22:47.960
I'm gonna just digest and see what happens,

22:47.960 --> 22:50.440
but I would really, really appreciate

22:50.440 --> 22:53.240
some sort of perspective, any perspective.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.280
Really, I just wanna think about this

22:54.280 --> 22:58.160
from all the angles, linuxunplugged.com slash-

22:58.160 --> 22:59.000
Contact.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.040
Yeah, you knew where I was going with that.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.520
I'd really like to get people's input on this one.

23:03.520 --> 23:07.200
Now, there's another story that I feel like in another era,

23:07.200 --> 23:09.760
I would be all over this story.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.080
If Unfilter was still a show,

23:11.080 --> 23:13.040
this would be something that I could sit here

23:13.040 --> 23:14.280
and I could just tell you everything

23:14.280 --> 23:16.880
off the top of my head about this.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.480
But you may have heard, quote, unquote,

23:19.480 --> 23:21.280
the government is trying to ban encryption,

23:21.280 --> 23:22.320
quote, end quote.

23:22.320 --> 23:23.160
Have you heard that?

23:23.160 --> 23:24.000
I have heard that.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.080
Well, the EFF and their Action Center

23:27.080 --> 23:28.800
is trying to raise the alarm

23:28.800 --> 23:31.880
about the Graham Blumenthal bill,

23:31.880 --> 23:34.360
which is called something ridiculous.

23:34.360 --> 23:35.200
It's got a name-

23:35.200 --> 23:36.040
The EARNET Act.

23:36.040 --> 23:36.880
Yes, the EARNET.

23:36.880 --> 23:38.080
EARNET.

23:38.080 --> 23:42.040
And the high level is it, in the United States,

23:42.040 --> 23:45.200
would make it mandatory for companies

23:45.200 --> 23:47.880
to enable backdoors into encryption.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.120
Which is something we've seen being pressed

23:50.120 --> 23:51.080
time and time again.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.840
You know, it comes and it goes.

23:52.840 --> 23:57.200
My main concern, obviously, is the implications

23:57.200 --> 23:58.920
from a security standpoint of this.

23:58.920 --> 24:01.720
But secondarily, the other concern I have

24:01.720 --> 24:04.400
is the conversation is within the context

24:04.400 --> 24:05.720
of commercial platforms.

24:05.720 --> 24:07.880
The conversation talks about iOS.

24:07.880 --> 24:08.720
And Android.

24:08.720 --> 24:09.560
And Google.

24:09.560 --> 24:10.400
And Apple.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.800
And Microsoft.

24:11.800 --> 24:14.880
And them working to provide the federal government

24:14.880 --> 24:17.160
with a legal means to break encryption.

24:18.920 --> 24:21.000
But never in the conversation

24:21.000 --> 24:23.480
is how this impacts free software.

24:23.480 --> 24:25.240
How does this affect developers

24:25.240 --> 24:27.480
who are writing software all over the world

24:27.480 --> 24:32.000
and the majority of their users are in the United States?

24:32.000 --> 24:34.480
I have extremely deep concerns

24:34.480 --> 24:37.120
about how this could affect open source software.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.800
And that is not part of this conversation.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.560
And I think it could be a fundamental game changer

24:42.560 --> 24:43.680
for free software.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.400
So I will have a link in the show notes

24:45.400 --> 24:46.800
for the EFF's Action Center.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.080
They write, members of Congress have mounted

24:49.080 --> 24:50.880
a major threat to your freedoms of speech

24:50.880 --> 24:52.200
and security online.

24:52.200 --> 24:55.480
Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal,

24:55.480 --> 24:57.480
which Graham is a Republican,

24:57.480 --> 25:00.840
Blumenthal is a Democrat, so it's, quote, bipartisan,

25:00.840 --> 25:03.000
recently introduced a bill that would undermine

25:03.000 --> 25:05.560
key protections for internet speech in the US.

25:05.560 --> 25:08.360
It would also expose providers

25:08.360 --> 25:10.240
of private messaging services,

25:10.240 --> 25:13.760
like Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, et cetera,

25:14.920 --> 25:16.240
to extreme legal risk,

25:16.240 --> 25:17.760
potentially forcing them to undermine

25:17.760 --> 25:19.280
their tools of security.

25:19.280 --> 25:22.720
The so-called EARN-IT Act, Senate 3398,

25:22.720 --> 25:26.080
is anti-speech, anti-security, anti-innovation,

25:26.080 --> 25:27.320
and unnecessary.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.480
Let's tell Congress to reject it.

25:29.480 --> 25:30.560
I couldn't say it better myself.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.480
I honestly have not been as informed on this

25:32.480 --> 25:36.640
because of the crazy amount of corona news going on.

25:36.640 --> 25:40.320
And, you know, that's probably the exact condition

25:40.320 --> 25:42.200
they're relying on for nobody to notice this

25:42.200 --> 25:43.560
and let it just sneak right through.

25:43.560 --> 25:44.400
Well, if you think about it, right,

25:44.400 --> 25:45.720
we'd had this conversation around,

25:45.720 --> 25:48.120
between law enforcement and security experts around,

25:48.120 --> 25:49.720
like, I mean, what's possible?

25:49.720 --> 25:52.160
We all know that no one's gonna all follow the laws,

25:52.160 --> 25:53.000
and when you break encryption,

25:53.000 --> 25:56.080
it creates problems basically for everyone.

25:56.080 --> 25:59.000
I don't think that changed in the last six months.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.160
Right? Yeah.

26:00.160 --> 26:04.720
Yeah, and it's like technology doesn't understand borders.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.960
Source code doesn't necessarily appreciate

26:06.960 --> 26:09.040
your silly nation-state government.

26:09.040 --> 26:12.200
You fundamentally make something flawed here.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.640
It makes it flawed everywhere around the world.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.800
And maybe, listening to this, you think,

26:16.800 --> 26:17.640
well, what's to worry about?

26:17.640 --> 26:18.760
I have nothing to hide.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.080
Perhaps you have full faith

26:20.080 --> 26:21.320
in your United States government.

26:21.320 --> 26:23.320
Congratulations, that must feel great.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.560
But how do you feel about China?

26:25.560 --> 26:27.400
How do you feel about Iran?

26:27.400 --> 26:30.960
How do you feel about the United States, say, in 30 years?

26:30.960 --> 26:33.200
Are you concerned that then it could be abused

26:33.200 --> 26:34.400
in those situations?

26:34.400 --> 26:37.560
If you are, then we have to do something today.

26:37.560 --> 26:38.400
That's it.

26:38.400 --> 26:39.760
I think, too, that, you know,

26:39.760 --> 26:41.920
one of the underlying things that we haven't mentioned here

26:41.920 --> 26:46.200
is the serious flaw are the people, right?

26:46.200 --> 26:48.920
The people that are in control of gathering this data,

26:48.920 --> 26:53.320
what prevents them from gathering data from a company

26:53.320 --> 26:56.280
that's using some sort of encrypted communication?

26:56.280 --> 26:58.560
You know, when they're trying to figure out,

26:58.560 --> 27:01.680
should we go with Azure or should we go with AWS?

27:01.680 --> 27:06.280
Well, let's tap into their private encrypted systems

27:06.280 --> 27:08.440
and see what they're saying about us about the deal, right?

27:08.440 --> 27:10.400
So I think that it really comes down

27:10.400 --> 27:13.200
to you're giving this power now to humans

27:13.200 --> 27:17.040
who are notably flawed and are going to end up using it

27:17.040 --> 27:20.560
for, you know, really anything that they choose, so.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.560
And the issue with the Earn It Act

27:22.560 --> 27:27.360
is it itself does not necessarily lay out

27:27.360 --> 27:30.840
the banning of encryption or any specific things like that.

27:30.840 --> 27:35.240
What it does is it designates a council of 19 people,

27:36.160 --> 27:41.160
half of which, mostly, mostly, most of it, most of it.

27:41.440 --> 27:42.640
I think we should go with that, dude.

27:42.640 --> 27:44.680
It's new, it's accepted, you're using it.

27:44.680 --> 27:48.320
It could be my version of Nodamine, you know what I mean?

27:48.320 --> 27:50.040
This is my version of that.

27:50.040 --> 27:50.880
I like it.

27:50.880 --> 27:54.240
So it's got 19 people on the council,

27:54.240 --> 27:56.520
almost half of which are law enforcement.

27:56.520 --> 27:58.360
Now here's the fun thing.

27:58.360 --> 28:01.960
Two of the people on the council have tech experience.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.480
Now this council will be formed.

28:03.480 --> 28:06.920
It will determine a list of best practices,

28:07.920 --> 28:09.800
things that remind you that you gotta think

28:09.800 --> 28:11.760
about the poor children and terrorism

28:11.760 --> 28:14.080
and any other kind of agenda these people wanna push.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.680
And it's only two of the people on this board

28:16.680 --> 28:19.040
have any technical experience at all.

28:19.040 --> 28:22.840
And they will make the rules that Apple and Google

28:22.840 --> 28:24.720
and anyone distributing software

28:24.720 --> 28:26.240
in the United States of America

28:26.240 --> 28:28.240
that wants to be lawful has to follow.

28:29.840 --> 28:32.160
That's what's about to happen.

28:32.160 --> 28:33.960
This council of 19 people,

28:35.000 --> 28:36.800
and two of them are tech people,

28:36.800 --> 28:38.960
are gonna decide if you can use encryption or not,

28:38.960 --> 28:40.320
if this passes.

28:42.080 --> 28:43.400
And we don't normally talk about this kind of stuff

28:43.400 --> 28:46.120
on the show, but I can only wonder

28:46.120 --> 28:48.680
what the ramifications would be for free software.

28:48.680 --> 28:52.400
How does a developer in Germany navigate this?

28:52.400 --> 28:53.560
I do not know.

28:53.560 --> 28:56.560
And you know, it's so silly is imagine a developer

28:56.560 --> 29:01.560
who is in Vancouver, Canada, or in Mexico,

29:02.120 --> 29:04.160
just miles from the border.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.960
And it fundamentally changes the legality

29:05.960 --> 29:07.960
of the free software project they're working on.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.360
It's so silly.

29:09.360 --> 29:12.720
It is legislation of a bygone era,

29:12.720 --> 29:14.920
just like Blumenthal and Graham.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.760
They are of a bygone era.

29:16.760 --> 29:18.920
So let's talk about something of a more modern era,

29:18.920 --> 29:22.640
GNOME 3.36, which Wes and I have been using

29:22.640 --> 29:26.160
for the last week, essentially via Ubuntu 2004.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.440
Well, it was just so easy.

29:27.440 --> 29:30.240
We loaded that up after our week with Windows.

29:30.240 --> 29:32.800
And I'm gonna say as much as I can

29:32.800 --> 29:35.800
for our review of 2004, which is not yet released,

29:35.800 --> 29:38.560
but it has been wonderful.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.960
Now, I'm curious, I could say a whole bunch,

29:41.960 --> 29:43.200
but I'm curious what your take is

29:43.200 --> 29:45.920
because you've spent a year and a half now in plasma.

29:45.920 --> 29:49.160
It feels very refreshingly minimal.

29:49.160 --> 29:52.320
And I like, I've sort of installed Ubuntu 2004

29:52.320 --> 29:55.240
five or six times now in the past couple of weeks.

29:55.240 --> 29:58.000
It's also really nice how fast I can get going

29:58.000 --> 29:58.960
in that fresh install.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.040
Like I tweak a couple of things,

30:00.040 --> 30:02.480
I've got that down now because I've done it a few times.

30:02.480 --> 30:04.200
And then I have a totally usable system.

30:04.200 --> 30:05.920
So that's been nice.

30:05.920 --> 30:08.000
Yeah, how fast does that feel though?

30:08.000 --> 30:11.040
Super snappy, very appropriate animations

30:11.040 --> 30:12.360
all over the place.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.800
And that new lock screen, oh boy.

30:14.800 --> 30:17.720
Oh man, the lock screen is very pro.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.800
It is very, very pro.

30:19.800 --> 30:22.760
I'm curious though, if you feel like it's quote unquote,

30:22.760 --> 30:25.040
snappier than plasma.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.000
In some areas, yes.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.280
In some areas, no.

30:28.280 --> 30:32.320
I will say running it on Wayland has been very nice.

30:32.320 --> 30:33.160
Pretty much flawless.

30:33.160 --> 30:35.080
Look at you, you're going all in now.

30:35.080 --> 30:37.560
Well, I mean, that's 2004.

30:37.560 --> 30:38.400
That's right.

30:38.400 --> 30:39.880
Gotta find out if it'll work.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.120
It's very nice.

30:41.120 --> 30:45.480
GNOME 3.6 is, and as somebody who talks

30:45.480 --> 30:46.320
about this stuff a lot,

30:46.320 --> 30:48.040
I try to think of something new I can say,

30:48.040 --> 30:50.720
but it is the best, it is the fastest release

30:50.720 --> 30:53.320
of the GNOME Shell that I have ever used.

30:53.320 --> 30:56.400
It is the best, it is the best version of GNOME ever.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.240
It really is.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.400
It simply is the best version of GNOME ever.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.640
And I wish I could stop saying that in a way

31:01.640 --> 31:04.440
because it's almost become cliche for me to say

31:04.440 --> 31:06.080
this new release is better.

31:06.080 --> 31:10.000
I feel like since GNOME 3.11, I've been saying.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.280
Yeah, accurate.

31:11.280 --> 31:12.120
Every release is better.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.720
But they're hitting the stride.

31:13.720 --> 31:15.360
The project's just doing great.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.600
I gotta say, so I spent some time on the Mac

31:17.600 --> 31:18.880
and I was like, oh, this is great

31:18.880 --> 31:20.120
with all these third-party apps

31:20.120 --> 31:22.560
and the windowing environment's very snappy.

31:22.560 --> 31:24.400
Then I went to Windows and I'm like, oh boy,

31:24.400 --> 31:26.520
this is a little rough, but I can understand

31:26.520 --> 31:28.800
if I needed a commercial grade application,

31:28.800 --> 31:29.880
I can see the appeal.

31:29.880 --> 31:32.760
And now with the subsystem, it's actually livable.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.640
And that's a big admission coming from me

31:35.640 --> 31:38.560
because I have issues with Windows.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.400
And then after all of that, on the same hardware,

31:40.400 --> 31:43.640
I came back to Ubuntu 2004

31:43.640 --> 31:47.400
and then latest GNOME Shell, GNOME 3.36.

31:47.400 --> 31:50.720
And what you have here, without spoiling our review,

31:50.720 --> 31:55.720
is the best product Canonical has ever made for the desktop

31:55.920 --> 31:58.320
and the best version of GNOME Shell

31:58.320 --> 32:00.200
that has ever been released.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.920
And those two things came together in one product.

32:02.920 --> 32:06.360
It is the best release of Ubuntu ever.

32:06.360 --> 32:09.000
And I have been using it since the very first release.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.720
I think we were impressed just from the moment

32:10.720 --> 32:12.000
we booted up the flash drive.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.920
Absolutely, and now I have been using it for a week

32:14.920 --> 32:17.400
and I am going to just keep it on there.

32:17.400 --> 32:21.600
I just love it, it looks beautiful.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.760
GNOME has come so far.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.440
You were mentioning the system settings,

32:25.440 --> 32:26.280
how great that is now.

32:26.280 --> 32:27.880
Oh, the system settings are beautiful.

32:27.880 --> 32:30.280
I was so surprised, especially coming from Plasma.

32:30.280 --> 32:32.720
I was like, it's all in one place, it's unified,

32:32.720 --> 32:35.520
it's sleek, and it's just as easy to use.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.040
How long have I wanted just one spot

32:37.040 --> 32:38.720
where I just click the dark mode?

32:38.720 --> 32:40.800
Just click dark and everything.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.240
It doesn't have to be like a special theme

32:42.240 --> 32:46.000
where I go change the GTK theme and the Shell theme

32:46.000 --> 32:47.760
and the cursor theme.

32:47.760 --> 32:51.520
It's just dark mode, boom, and everything switches

32:51.520 --> 32:55.640
and it's elegant and it's refined and it's well done.

32:55.640 --> 32:59.000
And then you combine that with the just incredible

32:59.000 --> 33:02.320
performance of GNOME Shell 3.36

33:02.320 --> 33:04.760
and the new updates they have made to it,

33:04.760 --> 33:07.520
like my favorite is do not disturb mode

33:07.520 --> 33:10.280
in the notifications, hell a frickin' loo-ya.

33:10.280 --> 33:14.440
It is by far the best version I've ever used

33:14.440 --> 33:17.360
and I enjoyed every moment of using it.

33:17.360 --> 33:20.120
And I was legitimately a little worried

33:20.120 --> 33:23.520
after really enjoying the Mac, not really liking Windows,

33:23.520 --> 33:25.600
I was like, what if I switched to GNOME Shell again

33:25.600 --> 33:27.360
and Ubuntu and I hate it?

33:27.360 --> 33:28.760
What if I don't enjoy it?

33:28.760 --> 33:30.440
What does that mean?

33:30.440 --> 33:31.760
I gotta say.

33:31.760 --> 33:32.840
Not a problem for today.

33:32.840 --> 33:36.360
Brilliant, brilliant, and I don't do as Chris does,

33:36.360 --> 33:38.080
but I'm gonna just stick with this release

33:38.080 --> 33:39.040
even though it's not done yet.

33:39.040 --> 33:40.880
I'm gonna leave it on this machine.

33:40.880 --> 33:44.860
The only downside was their cool ZFS automatic

33:44.860 --> 33:48.940
partitioner roofing totally has to re-wipe the drive.

33:48.940 --> 33:51.660
So no more Windows on there, had to give up Windows.

33:51.660 --> 33:54.120
I was gonna try to dual boot that S,

33:54.120 --> 33:55.720
try that out for a little while so I could keep playing

33:55.720 --> 33:58.320
with Windows Terminal and subsystem,

33:58.320 --> 34:01.440
but to have all the fancy automatic snapshots.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.360
Hey, you got snapshots, who cares about Windows?

34:03.360 --> 34:04.760
CFS stuff, I was like, yeah,

34:04.760 --> 34:07.080
it's not worth keeping Windows.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.320
So I had to wipe the whole drive and put Ubuntu on there,

34:09.320 --> 34:11.980
but it is great.

34:11.980 --> 34:16.040
And the upgrade is worth it for the lock screen alone.

34:16.040 --> 34:17.760
And think about, when have I ever said that?

34:17.760 --> 34:19.680
My favorite part was that they finally made it

34:19.680 --> 34:21.320
so you could suspend without having to know

34:21.320 --> 34:24.640
the magic key combo to get it to show up in the menu.

34:24.640 --> 34:25.640
I think you just had to hold shift,

34:25.640 --> 34:27.480
but now it has just an option to suspend.

34:27.480 --> 34:28.300
I think it was alt.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.140
I don't know if it was shift.

34:29.140 --> 34:29.980
I think it was alt.

34:29.980 --> 34:30.920
See, I don't even know.

34:30.920 --> 34:32.440
And I suspend my laptop all the time.

34:32.440 --> 34:35.800
So I will admit, it took me a really long time

34:35.800 --> 34:36.640
to realize that was there.

34:36.640 --> 34:37.600
Yes, I think that's true.

34:37.600 --> 34:38.960
It was just not accessible.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.400
I just would close the lid.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.000
But then I was on the desktop and I'm like,

34:43.000 --> 34:44.760
well, now, what if I want to suspend?

34:44.760 --> 34:48.320
And I'm Googling it, I'm like, oh, right, okay.

34:48.320 --> 34:49.600
Yeah, now it is right there.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.480
The whole thing's just, it's so great.

34:51.480 --> 34:52.880
It's so great to see it coming along.

34:52.880 --> 34:56.400
So if you haven't yet, go give the live environment a try.

34:56.400 --> 34:57.660
Go give it a try.

34:57.660 --> 34:59.240
Even if you're a longtime Plasma user,

34:59.240 --> 35:01.200
like old Westpain here.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.040
Go give it a go.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.800
I know, I guess I'm back in a gnome for a while.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.720
Maybe, maybe.

35:07.720 --> 35:08.540
You know, at the end of the day,

35:08.540 --> 35:09.680
you just want to get your work done

35:09.680 --> 35:12.020
and your Plasma environment is looking good.

35:12.020 --> 35:12.860
It's all set up.

35:12.860 --> 35:14.960
It works like it hasn't failed you yet.

35:14.960 --> 35:17.080
So I don't know.

35:17.080 --> 35:18.560
But I want to be on 2004.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.320
It's just, I can feel it.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.160
It's a good one.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.400
You think it's worth the whole reload?

35:22.400 --> 35:23.280
Oh yeah, it might be.

35:23.280 --> 35:24.120
I think it is.

35:24.120 --> 35:24.940
That old ZFS too.

35:24.940 --> 35:25.780
Yeah.

35:25.780 --> 35:26.620
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

35:26.620 --> 35:30.800
Well, how about just a little brief housekeeping

35:30.800 --> 35:32.000
before we get into the rest of the show?

35:32.000 --> 35:33.240
That's probably a responsible thing to do.

35:33.240 --> 35:34.240
We should clean up around here.

35:34.240 --> 35:35.060
I agree.

35:35.060 --> 35:37.220
Well, we just released a behind the scenes

35:37.220 --> 35:39.220
of Linux Unplugged on Jupiter Extras.

35:39.220 --> 35:43.040
If you go to extras.show slash 64,

35:43.040 --> 35:45.480
we looked back at episode one

35:45.480 --> 35:47.160
and then went over the arc of the show

35:47.160 --> 35:49.780
and essentially ended up making fun of me the entire time.

35:49.780 --> 35:52.120
I was so bad.

35:52.120 --> 35:53.300
We played an old sponsor.

35:53.300 --> 35:54.920
I didn't even know we had that sponsor.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.320
That's, it was so embarrassing.

35:57.320 --> 35:59.600
It was a different you really, Chris.

35:59.600 --> 36:00.680
Sure sounds like it.

36:00.680 --> 36:01.920
Yeah, I know.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.200
I sound 10 years younger.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.440
Anyways, if you're curious what goes

36:04.440 --> 36:07.600
into making Linux Unplugged, extras.show slash 64,

36:07.600 --> 36:10.920
we released Linux Unplugged behind the scenes.

36:10.920 --> 36:14.600
Also, if you're, maybe you're at home now.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.280
Maybe you got a little extra time during the day.

36:16.280 --> 36:18.060
You could listen to our show in the background.

36:18.060 --> 36:19.560
Would you like to know when we're live?

36:19.560 --> 36:22.140
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

36:22.140 --> 36:23.680
converts it to your local time.

36:23.680 --> 36:26.240
jblive.tv is where you watch us.

36:26.240 --> 36:27.400
It's more fun live.

36:27.400 --> 36:28.800
Now you heard me mention Linux Headline,

36:28.800 --> 36:32.320
linuxheadlines.show, three minutes or less every weekday,

36:32.320 --> 36:34.960
and we give you just the news you need to know about.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.320
I'm constantly discovering stuff

36:36.320 --> 36:39.080
through headlines that I wanted to know.

36:39.080 --> 36:44.080
And then officially, no Linux Fest Northwest this year.

36:44.240 --> 36:47.440
Whew, that hurts, that hurts.

36:49.060 --> 36:51.600
And we'll let you know when we know what they're doing.

36:51.600 --> 36:54.300
There has been some rumblings of maybe working

36:54.300 --> 36:56.280
with some of the speakers to record their talks

36:56.280 --> 36:57.660
and post them online.

36:57.660 --> 36:59.560
If they do that, we'll keep you posted.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.040
We'll let you know what's going on there.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.360
And then last but not least,

37:02.360 --> 37:05.480
that Telegram group, 1,700 users strong.

37:05.480 --> 37:06.320
Can't stop it.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.620
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram

37:08.620 --> 37:11.000
to get in on the conversation,

37:11.000 --> 37:14.380
the persistent conversation that continues

37:14.380 --> 37:15.880
even after the show.

37:15.880 --> 37:19.760
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram for all of that.

37:19.760 --> 37:23.800
All right, Mr. Westpain.

37:23.800 --> 37:28.800
Well, we had the opportunity to attend WSL Conf last week.

37:29.640 --> 37:34.160
When we recorded episode 344, it was in the midway point.

37:34.160 --> 37:35.920
We were actually breaking from the conference

37:35.920 --> 37:37.200
to record the show.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.740
Now it's all done.

37:38.740 --> 37:42.200
And the thing that is particularly unique about WSL Conf

37:42.200 --> 37:45.040
is A, first WSL Conf ever.

37:45.040 --> 37:45.880
Ever.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.640
And that was kind of a unique opportunity

37:47.640 --> 37:50.720
for a bunch of Linux users to show up at Microsoft.

37:50.720 --> 37:55.160
And B, it was one of the first tech conferences

37:55.160 --> 37:57.920
that had to pivot to an online format

37:57.920 --> 37:59.640
because of the developing COVID-19 situation.

37:59.640 --> 38:01.440
Right at the start of this wave, yeah.

38:01.440 --> 38:02.320
Yeah.

38:02.320 --> 38:06.520
And so not only was having WSL Conf for the first time ever

38:06.520 --> 38:08.720
an interesting thing worth talking about,

38:08.720 --> 38:10.120
but being the first tech conference

38:10.120 --> 38:14.000
to have to go online only,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.660
also was a very interesting kind of,

38:16.660 --> 38:18.240
let's talk about this moment.

38:18.240 --> 38:21.520
So we invited two different individuals on the show.

38:21.520 --> 38:22.360
Sohini.

38:22.360 --> 38:24.160
I'm Sohini Bianca Roy.

38:24.160 --> 38:26.940
I am a product manager at Canonical.

38:26.940 --> 38:28.640
And returning to the show, Hayden.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.600
Hi, I'm Hayden Barnes.

38:29.600 --> 38:32.160
I'm a senior developer advocate at Canonical.

38:32.160 --> 38:35.400
And they were fundamental to pulling off WSL Conf

38:35.400 --> 38:37.520
and converting it to an online conference.

38:37.520 --> 38:40.960
Now you'll note, they're both Canonical employees.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.200
They were working in partnership with Microsoft to do this,

38:43.200 --> 38:47.160
but this was a community-driven event.

38:47.160 --> 38:49.920
And they were the spear of that community.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.400
And so we wanted to have both of them on the show

38:51.400 --> 38:53.560
to talk about some of the dynamics of that,

38:53.560 --> 38:55.800
what that was like to kind of reach the point

38:55.800 --> 38:57.440
where we're gonna have a conference

38:57.440 --> 38:59.480
about the Windows subsystem for Linux.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.320
Really, why?

39:00.320 --> 39:01.400
Sponsored by Canonical?

39:01.400 --> 39:03.760
Yeah, like this isn't a Microsoft thing that's happening.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.680
Like what's going on here?

39:05.680 --> 39:10.180
And having attended it, feeling like we learned something,

39:10.180 --> 39:11.800
it was worth having these individuals on

39:11.800 --> 39:13.360
to really kind of chat about this

39:13.360 --> 39:15.680
and maybe even get some advice for future conferences

39:15.680 --> 39:17.560
that are also going virtual.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.720
So Hayden and Sohini are joining us now

39:19.720 --> 39:21.840
to talk about WSL Conf.

39:21.840 --> 39:25.160
And I, as an attendee, thought we should probably start

39:25.160 --> 39:29.160
at the very beginning and ask, why WSL Conf now?

39:29.160 --> 39:30.600
Sohini, do you wanna start with that one?

39:30.600 --> 39:31.600
Sure, I'd love to.

39:31.600 --> 39:35.840
I think it actually started, well, it started in 2016,

39:35.840 --> 39:38.200
really, when Microsoft announced at Build

39:38.200 --> 39:41.080
that they were going to invest in a partnership with us

39:41.080 --> 39:45.360
for Bash on Ubuntu for Windows.

39:45.360 --> 39:48.960
And now here we are many years later,

39:48.960 --> 39:52.920
but the community around it is just growing.

39:52.920 --> 39:56.800
And we've seen so many people who are thanking us

39:56.800 --> 39:59.360
right and left for supporting this.

39:59.360 --> 40:02.640
And we decided to get together a little bit

40:02.640 --> 40:05.040
to see what they're up to,

40:05.040 --> 40:07.520
to figure out how we can better support them.

40:07.520 --> 40:11.600
But it's also, they're really innovating

40:11.600 --> 40:13.360
really impressively in the space.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.720
And I think there was so much that we could have learned

40:15.720 --> 40:17.800
from our open source partners.

40:17.800 --> 40:20.080
And we wanted to get everyone together

40:20.080 --> 40:22.160
to figure out what happens next.

40:22.160 --> 40:26.120
Hayden, it also feels like the impending official release

40:26.120 --> 40:29.240
of WSL2 played a role in the timing of this.

40:29.240 --> 40:32.800
Certainly that demonstrated momentum in the platform.

40:32.800 --> 40:37.800
We announced WSL Conf in the fall after WSL2 was announced

40:39.240 --> 40:40.080
at Build.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.440
So that certainly kind of rolled into the momentum

40:42.440 --> 40:44.480
and had something to do with the timing.

40:44.480 --> 40:47.200
Yeah, well, and watching a lot of the presentations,

40:47.200 --> 40:49.560
it really seemed like a lot of it was individuals

40:49.560 --> 40:50.920
that are heavily using the subsystem,

40:50.920 --> 40:54.160
digesting how WSL2 will change workflows

40:54.160 --> 40:55.200
or improve workflows.

40:55.200 --> 40:58.280
And that was like a big part of the conference.

40:58.280 --> 40:59.240
Absolutely.

40:59.240 --> 41:02.880
WSL2 unlocks a lot of new possibilities for developers

41:04.000 --> 41:08.240
and with that full Linux application support on Windows.

41:08.240 --> 41:09.560
So I have a question for both of you.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.520
So Sahini, let's start with you.

41:11.520 --> 41:14.760
Have you observed much pushback or skepticism

41:14.760 --> 41:16.960
from the community around Canonical working

41:16.960 --> 41:18.840
with Microsoft on this?

41:18.840 --> 41:21.560
Because I get a sense of pressure

41:21.560 --> 41:23.000
from a portion of our audience

41:23.000 --> 41:25.480
that it's a little suspicious, the whole subsystem thing.

41:25.480 --> 41:28.720
And so I imagine if you're heavily involved with this,

41:28.720 --> 41:30.560
it may have come your way.

41:30.560 --> 41:31.680
I'm curious about that.

41:31.680 --> 41:34.040
Yeah, I think we live in a community

41:34.040 --> 41:37.200
that just loves the authenticity of open source

41:37.200 --> 41:39.080
and community driven activity.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.000
So it feels natural to be suspicious

41:42.000 --> 41:45.200
when companies are working together

41:45.200 --> 41:48.320
to build something that affects the community in this way.

41:48.320 --> 41:53.320
But I think all I see is the potential

41:53.360 --> 41:55.720
for our resources combined together.

41:55.720 --> 41:58.880
So I'm hoping that when we continue to build

41:58.880 --> 42:00.120
these community events,

42:00.120 --> 42:04.440
that we are really showing how much the community impacts

42:04.440 --> 42:07.080
how we build what we're doing together.

42:07.080 --> 42:09.360
And I don't know if that directly answers the question.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.640
So feel free to push on me a bit there.

42:11.640 --> 42:14.480
I get what you're saying because I think I observe that.

42:14.480 --> 42:19.400
It's sort of what I observe is there's people

42:19.400 --> 42:20.760
that are getting the work done

42:20.760 --> 42:22.720
that are seeing this as another tool

42:22.720 --> 42:23.640
that they're going to use.

42:23.640 --> 42:27.000
And then there's people that are just expressing

42:27.000 --> 42:30.240
an observational concern and maybe are not directly involved

42:30.240 --> 42:32.320
with the actual work getting done.

42:32.320 --> 42:33.880
Do you know what I mean?

42:33.880 --> 42:35.440
It's fair.

42:35.440 --> 42:37.600
So I might let Hayden push back

42:37.600 --> 42:39.760
on any additional perspective there.

42:39.760 --> 42:44.280
But I think we're just excited to keep working together

42:44.280 --> 42:46.800
because we just keep hearing so much great feedback

42:46.800 --> 42:48.720
from clients who are just excited

42:48.720 --> 42:50.080
about what we've been put out there.

42:50.080 --> 42:53.080
So I think I'm holding on to the positivity

42:53.080 --> 42:56.280
and I'm going to keep doing great work for everybody else.

42:56.280 --> 42:57.120
Good for you.

42:57.120 --> 42:58.680
There was a lot of excitement about things

42:58.680 --> 42:59.520
at the conference.

42:59.520 --> 43:00.840
So clearly people want to get work done.

43:00.840 --> 43:02.960
I think that is just the way you get it go forward

43:02.960 --> 43:04.160
is you just focus on the people

43:04.160 --> 43:05.000
that are getting the work done.

43:05.000 --> 43:06.600
And Hayden, I'm curious on your observations

43:06.600 --> 43:09.960
on concerns or suspicions or your overall thoughts on it.

43:09.960 --> 43:11.840
We've talked about this in the past

43:11.840 --> 43:15.280
and there's a certain segment of the Linux community

43:15.280 --> 43:18.440
that is going to be resistant,

43:18.440 --> 43:22.760
if not a little upset by what we're doing.

43:22.760 --> 43:27.760
And I think the vast majority of open source contributors

43:28.040 --> 43:30.280
understand that there's a role for community,

43:30.280 --> 43:31.840
there's a role for corporations.

43:31.840 --> 43:35.240
And we really tried to balance that at WSL Conf.

43:38.080 --> 43:42.280
What you didn't see is that all the parties working on that

43:42.280 --> 43:44.480
took a lot of steps to make sure

43:44.480 --> 43:48.600
that that remained an independent community event.

43:48.600 --> 43:51.240
And that's what we're focusing on.

43:51.240 --> 43:56.240
So the concern that Microsoft is somehow going to influence

43:57.760 --> 44:02.120
how we do things here at Ubuntu is just not founded.

44:02.120 --> 44:05.720
Yeah, it's sort of like implying that digital ocean

44:05.720 --> 44:08.520
is impacting the way that Ubuntu images are created.

44:08.520 --> 44:12.520
It's another actually I think very clever target for Ubuntu.

44:12.520 --> 44:14.640
And I think you guys are going at it

44:14.640 --> 44:15.880
in a really kind of aggressive way,

44:15.880 --> 44:17.160
which I congratulate you for.

44:17.160 --> 44:19.600
So let's pivot a little bit to the actual event itself.

44:19.600 --> 44:23.720
Before we get to the big change to virtual,

44:23.720 --> 44:25.240
I'm not sure who might have the most experience,

44:25.240 --> 44:26.520
but I'd love to know what it was like

44:26.520 --> 44:28.600
interfacing with Microsoft to set up space

44:28.600 --> 44:30.800
on their own campus for a Linux event.

44:30.800 --> 44:34.320
A lot of the images where Linux arrives at Microsoft

44:34.320 --> 44:37.640
and it felt fun and unique and it felt like a real moment.

44:37.640 --> 44:40.280
Microsoft actually sponsors reactor spaces.

44:40.280 --> 44:42.880
And I think there's about seven or eight throughout the world

44:42.880 --> 44:46.800
and open source projects and communities

44:46.800 --> 44:49.760
can reserve those spaces free of charge.

44:49.760 --> 44:54.440
And they let us reserve a space for two whole days

44:54.440 --> 44:58.360
and that's open to meetups, user groups,

44:58.360 --> 45:00.000
other small conferences.

45:00.000 --> 45:01.680
So they were very welcoming

45:01.680 --> 45:04.680
and opened their doors to us and hosted us.

45:04.680 --> 45:06.840
And we were appreciative of that.

45:06.840 --> 45:09.040
They did a lot of work for us that we ended up,

45:09.040 --> 45:11.600
of course, not having to rely on,

45:11.600 --> 45:15.240
but we still, we made the best of it.

45:15.240 --> 45:18.480
And we look forward to having an in-person event

45:18.480 --> 45:19.480
down the line.

45:19.480 --> 45:21.120
Yeah, I could see it still,

45:21.120 --> 45:23.200
it seems like the virtual one was pretty successful.

45:23.200 --> 45:24.560
So I could definitely see that happening.

45:24.560 --> 45:28.760
Let's talk about the internal decision process

45:28.760 --> 45:30.520
that must've just been-

45:30.520 --> 45:31.360
Couldn't have been easy.

45:31.360 --> 45:33.040
It must've been super hard.

45:33.040 --> 45:35.800
So, and especially the timing of this whole COVID-19 stuff

45:35.800 --> 45:37.400
is this was a few weeks ago

45:37.400 --> 45:39.560
where this discussion must've started.

45:39.560 --> 45:41.880
Now it seems inevitable from where we sit now,

45:41.880 --> 45:43.680
but how did this begin?

45:43.680 --> 45:47.280
And how difficult was that conversation?

45:47.280 --> 45:50.320
And really kind of at the end of it,

45:50.320 --> 45:53.240
ultimately what made the decision to go virtual?

45:53.240 --> 45:54.520
You know, with toilet paper,

45:54.520 --> 45:58.560
a highly coveted item and quarantine memes

45:58.560 --> 46:00.640
just all over my social media,

46:00.640 --> 46:02.720
it seems kind of like you said,

46:02.720 --> 46:03.960
inevitable and obvious

46:03.960 --> 46:06.200
that we would have switched to a virtual event.

46:06.200 --> 46:09.960
But if I take a moment to go back to the mentality

46:09.960 --> 46:13.960
of March 2nd, which was, you know, eight days

46:13.960 --> 46:16.240
before our conference was supposed to happen,

46:16.240 --> 46:17.560
the mentality was a little uncertain.

46:17.560 --> 46:20.440
I remember even texting Hayden the weekend before

46:20.440 --> 46:23.480
being like, it's 80% sure we're doing this right in person.

46:24.680 --> 46:27.760
And that morning Seattle King County Public Health

46:27.760 --> 46:29.560
and Communications leadership came out

46:29.560 --> 46:30.880
and they actually said,

46:30.880 --> 46:32.200
you know, we are not recommending

46:32.200 --> 46:35.480
widespread cancellations of gatherings or schools.

46:35.480 --> 46:37.160
KubeCon sent an email saying,

46:37.160 --> 46:39.160
we're definitely going forward.

46:39.160 --> 46:43.160
Emerald City Comic Con, which is obviously in Seattle,

46:43.160 --> 46:44.800
said they were going forward.

46:44.800 --> 46:46.320
That decision switched March 6th,

46:46.320 --> 46:49.280
but things changed really quickly.

46:49.280 --> 46:52.760
And we, I think, just had a conversation together

46:52.760 --> 46:54.520
and we were like, well, we take the risk

46:54.520 --> 46:56.360
of having people come over,

46:56.360 --> 46:57.760
maybe their visas being denied,

46:57.760 --> 47:00.880
maybe people getting stuck in Seattle or Redmond.

47:00.880 --> 47:03.760
And then the risk of further infection

47:03.760 --> 47:06.480
for people becoming hosts of this virus

47:06.480 --> 47:10.920
was that risk worth the collaboration that we could achieve

47:10.920 --> 47:13.760
and some of the melding of the minds

47:13.760 --> 47:14.680
that we could have achieved

47:14.680 --> 47:18.120
in that personal, intimate environment in Redmond.

47:18.120 --> 47:21.240
And we decided that we could switch

47:21.240 --> 47:24.360
the intention of the event, make it virtual,

47:24.360 --> 47:26.960
expand access to people, get the word out

47:26.960 --> 47:29.160
about what people are doing with WSL,

47:29.160 --> 47:31.680
get that energy, and then reschedule

47:31.680 --> 47:34.920
for that in-person event for later in the fall.

47:34.920 --> 47:37.360
So that was really tough

47:37.360 --> 47:40.680
and we had to kind of change our mentalities.

47:40.680 --> 47:43.160
We had been working towards this event for months

47:43.160 --> 47:45.760
and it was so exciting to finally be able to meet

47:45.760 --> 47:48.640
all these people we've been chatting with online forever.

47:48.640 --> 47:50.200
I feel like one of our presenters

47:50.200 --> 47:51.520
is one of my best friends now

47:51.520 --> 47:53.920
because we're just constantly in contact now.

47:55.240 --> 47:57.880
That it was a hard decision,

47:57.880 --> 48:01.320
but I'm excited again that we were able to expand that access

48:01.320 --> 48:02.440
the way that we did.

48:02.440 --> 48:05.120
Yeah, and having attended the virtual conference,

48:05.120 --> 48:07.640
I expected it to be much rougher, honestly,

48:07.640 --> 48:09.000
because of the last minute nature

48:09.000 --> 48:10.560
of having to make this pivot.

48:10.560 --> 48:13.120
And it sounded like there was even a change out

48:13.120 --> 48:15.680
of which technology platform was gonna be used to doing it.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.120
That must have been a complete scramble.

48:17.120 --> 48:17.960
Oh gosh, yeah.

48:17.960 --> 48:21.720
There were three really critical pieces

48:21.720 --> 48:24.400
that we had to be really strategic about.

48:24.400 --> 48:26.280
One was just the presenters.

48:26.280 --> 48:28.240
We wanted to make sure they were comfortable

48:28.240 --> 48:32.600
and confident in presenting to a now different kind

48:32.600 --> 48:35.840
of audience, a different cadence, different tempo.

48:35.840 --> 48:38.040
So we had presenters come in.

48:38.040 --> 48:40.240
We did one-on-ones with a lot of presenters

48:41.120 --> 48:44.000
and making sure their audio was good.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.800
They felt comfortable with all of the new technology.

48:46.800 --> 48:48.840
And in one of those sessions,

48:48.840 --> 48:52.240
we were trying out Microsoft Teams

48:52.240 --> 48:57.000
and some folks just, we had kind of unexplainable issues,

48:57.000 --> 48:58.720
things that we weren't able to pinpoint.

48:58.720 --> 49:01.720
And I'm sure Microsoft Teams had a little bit of a backlog.

49:01.720 --> 49:05.480
And we had three business days to make the switch.

49:05.480 --> 49:08.600
And we realized on the Friday before our event

49:08.600 --> 49:11.640
that Microsoft Teams, there were just too many glitches

49:11.640 --> 49:13.600
and the risk was too high.

49:13.600 --> 49:16.640
We just, we still wanted it to be a really smooth event,

49:16.640 --> 49:19.880
not filled with mic taps and oh, you know,

49:19.880 --> 49:22.280
forgot to install something.

49:22.280 --> 49:27.280
So it was a tough decision going away from Microsoft Teams

49:27.680 --> 49:30.160
but we already had a relationship with BlueJeans

49:30.160 --> 49:33.760
and we were already set up to go

49:33.760 --> 49:35.480
with a pretty large event through BlueJeans.

49:35.480 --> 49:37.240
And we figured that would be the right step

49:37.240 --> 49:38.520
for us at that time.

49:38.520 --> 49:40.640
You both were very active in the community

49:40.640 --> 49:43.040
during all of this, answering questions from attendees.

49:43.040 --> 49:45.440
Hayden, I'm curious if you have any lessons learned

49:45.440 --> 49:49.680
from replicating the hallway track in a virtual conference

49:49.680 --> 49:52.200
or any other thoughts on lessons learned from both of you

49:52.200 --> 49:53.080
but we'll start with Hayden here

49:53.080 --> 49:55.600
because a lot of things are switching virtual.

49:55.600 --> 49:57.400
It sounds like our beloved Linux Fest Northwest

49:57.400 --> 49:59.840
is gonna go at some version of this.

49:59.840 --> 50:01.080
What can we pass on to them?

50:01.080 --> 50:02.480
We felt like trailblazers here

50:02.480 --> 50:05.400
because not only are we a WSL conference

50:05.400 --> 50:06.840
but as far as I know,

50:06.840 --> 50:09.480
we're one of the first open source conferences

50:09.480 --> 50:13.160
to pivot this quickly to a virtual event.

50:14.080 --> 50:16.280
Some of the lessons that I've taken away.

50:16.280 --> 50:19.960
So for example, we had a round of testing with Teams

50:19.960 --> 50:23.720
with our presenters and we identified some issues

50:23.720 --> 50:26.160
and we worked through those issues

50:26.160 --> 50:27.720
and then we had a second round of testing

50:27.720 --> 50:29.920
and then we determined that our solutions

50:29.920 --> 50:32.480
to those issues were not effective.

50:32.480 --> 50:34.400
And that's when we made our pivot.

50:34.400 --> 50:39.400
Had I had the advantage of the perspective that I have now,

50:39.600 --> 50:44.600
we would have engaged Teams sooner rather than later.

50:44.760 --> 50:49.120
And I will say from now on for any in-person event,

50:49.120 --> 50:51.160
I will always have, how do we pivot this

50:51.160 --> 50:53.520
to a virtual event in the back of my mind?

50:53.520 --> 50:54.800
Because you never really plan

50:54.800 --> 50:57.040
for a worldwide global viral pandemic.

50:57.040 --> 50:59.800
You sure don't.

50:59.800 --> 51:02.560
So we plan for a lot of things

51:02.560 --> 51:05.640
and we had a lot of great things lined up

51:05.640 --> 51:09.120
but honestly, this one caught us by surprise.

51:09.120 --> 51:11.680
And I think moving forward,

51:11.680 --> 51:14.800
there's gonna be a whole proliferation of tools

51:14.800 --> 51:17.760
and best practices kind of coming out

51:17.760 --> 51:19.760
of the next few weeks.

51:19.760 --> 51:23.320
I think if I look at some of the things that I've built

51:23.320 --> 51:27.400
that I'm most proud of, they've been over a beer

51:27.400 --> 51:31.400
or over dinner or some weird offhand exchange

51:31.400 --> 51:33.160
with people that I met at a conference

51:33.160 --> 51:36.560
or people I met unintentionally or something like that.

51:36.560 --> 51:39.200
So having that backroom kind of interaction,

51:39.200 --> 51:41.480
having some kind of way to network

51:41.480 --> 51:43.760
with folks that you're meeting was so important

51:43.760 --> 51:47.960
because I wanted to still create that aspect of networking,

51:47.960 --> 51:49.400
of connection, of jokes,

51:49.400 --> 51:54.200
of some personal human interaction from a virtual event.

51:54.200 --> 51:58.680
And so we had a few polls, we had the Telegram channel

51:58.680 --> 52:01.520
and I think those were good starts.

52:01.520 --> 52:06.360
If I were to think about any future virtual events,

52:06.360 --> 52:10.200
I'd want to maybe facilitate maybe like topics

52:10.200 --> 52:12.520
that people can sign up for in small groups

52:12.520 --> 52:15.560
and just share things that they're working on

52:15.560 --> 52:18.200
or ask questions in a smaller controlled environment

52:18.200 --> 52:21.240
so people feel more comfortable engaging

52:21.240 --> 52:22.880
and sharing what they're up to.

52:22.880 --> 52:26.080
Because I think presenting or being a presenter

52:26.080 --> 52:28.120
is much harder than networking

52:28.120 --> 52:31.080
or having these side conversations, if that follows.

52:31.080 --> 52:31.920
Yeah, it does.

52:31.920 --> 52:33.760
And maybe facilitating little virtual birds

52:33.760 --> 52:34.880
of a feather type sessions

52:34.880 --> 52:36.520
that seem to be popular at events.

52:36.520 --> 52:37.720
As great as Telegram can be,

52:37.720 --> 52:40.200
you often have the loudest and most communicative folks

52:40.200 --> 52:41.160
sort of dominate there.

52:41.160 --> 52:42.560
So yeah, smaller sessions.

52:42.560 --> 52:43.720
Sounds like good lessons learned,

52:43.720 --> 52:45.440
but I mean, really hats off,

52:45.440 --> 52:47.080
I expected it to be so much rougher

52:47.080 --> 52:49.600
and the core value of the event was truly there.

52:49.600 --> 52:51.440
It really was, it was a great conference.

52:51.440 --> 52:53.280
I feel like it shifted my whole perspective

52:53.280 --> 52:54.880
on the subsystem for Linux

52:54.880 --> 52:57.200
and maybe kind of appreciate the fact

52:57.200 --> 53:00.160
that ultimately it's gonna mean more Linux applications

53:00.160 --> 53:02.640
and more things written for the Linux platform

53:02.640 --> 53:04.760
and more people learning Linux commands

53:04.760 --> 53:06.080
and Linux syntaxes

53:06.080 --> 53:08.920
and ultimately it's gonna be a good thing for Linux.

53:08.920 --> 53:11.720
Absolutely, I think Hayden and I when we,

53:11.720 --> 53:14.960
our first check-in together was what do we want

53:14.960 --> 53:15.800
out of all of this?

53:15.800 --> 53:17.560
And it was Linux for everybody.

53:17.560 --> 53:21.640
And I think WSL has been a great way for us

53:21.640 --> 53:24.360
to expand that mission, that project.

53:24.360 --> 53:25.200
Absolutely.

53:25.200 --> 53:27.520
We just got, Microsoft just announced today

53:27.520 --> 53:30.960
that they've passed 1 billion Windows 10 devices.

53:30.960 --> 53:35.360
And we see that as 1 billion potential WSL users

53:35.360 --> 53:38.040
to get them into the Linux ecosystem

53:38.040 --> 53:40.800
and trained on those Linux skills.

53:40.800 --> 53:43.280
And contributing to the code, open source.

53:43.280 --> 53:45.040
Let's get more, let's get more.

53:45.040 --> 53:46.880
Boy, I couldn't say it better myself.

53:46.880 --> 53:48.400
Well, thank you both very much.

53:48.400 --> 53:49.320
Thank you for the great event

53:49.320 --> 53:51.240
and thanks for coming on and telling us a little bit

53:51.240 --> 53:52.560
of the behind the scenes from it.

53:52.560 --> 53:53.600
Thanks for having us.

53:53.600 --> 53:56.080
It's been our pleasure, thank you so much.

53:56.080 --> 53:58.120
I won't lie, it's not quite the same

53:58.120 --> 53:59.200
not being there in person.

53:59.200 --> 54:01.280
And as we were wrapping up that conversation,

54:01.280 --> 54:02.960
my thought was I wish I would have been able

54:02.960 --> 54:05.800
to have this exact conversation in person with them.

54:05.800 --> 54:07.880
Oh yeah, I was really looking forward to meeting Hayden.

54:07.880 --> 54:09.720
Yeah, but at the same time,

54:09.720 --> 54:12.920
the core thing was actually still very useful.

54:12.920 --> 54:16.200
I attended this thing and I learned something.

54:16.200 --> 54:18.640
And if that is something,

54:18.640 --> 54:21.480
like that's a decent return on my investment of time.

54:21.480 --> 54:23.680
Well, and I think they both talked about it there,

54:23.680 --> 54:26.080
recognizing right away that you had to approach this thing

54:26.080 --> 54:27.960
from a totally different angle and philosophy

54:27.960 --> 54:29.560
about like what you were building.

54:29.560 --> 54:31.200
And I think that helped make it a success

54:31.200 --> 54:33.360
because it wasn't trying to be a physical event.

54:33.360 --> 54:35.920
It really was a virtual event to teach

54:35.920 --> 54:37.720
and get the word out about WSL.

54:37.720 --> 54:40.640
It's also a lot more possible when you can leverage tools

54:40.640 --> 54:43.120
like BlueJeans and Telegram and Twitter

54:43.120 --> 54:46.760
to kind of get the word out about a very changing event.

54:47.920 --> 54:49.360
But if they were to say, hey, you know what,

54:49.360 --> 54:51.520
we've decided to have a September or October

54:51.520 --> 54:53.520
WSL Conf in person, I'd go.

54:53.520 --> 54:54.360
Yeah.

54:55.640 --> 54:56.840
It was sort of perfect timing

54:56.840 --> 54:58.360
since we were running Windows 10 as well

54:58.360 --> 55:01.200
and using the new terminal and using the subsystem.

55:01.200 --> 55:03.600
So we were kind of hip to everything they were talking about.

55:03.600 --> 55:04.440
Oh man.

55:04.440 --> 55:08.200
Ah, all right.

55:08.200 --> 55:11.000
Well, how about we do a little epics

55:11.000 --> 55:12.120
before we get out of here?

55:12.120 --> 55:13.800
We've got two for you this week.

55:13.800 --> 55:16.600
Number one is something that I think might be useful

55:16.600 --> 55:18.320
for those of you who are working from home

55:18.320 --> 55:19.840
and need to manage a VPN

55:19.840 --> 55:22.080
and wanna do something at the network level,

55:22.080 --> 55:25.360
or maybe it's just time to try out WireGuard.

55:25.360 --> 55:28.680
Friends, check out PyVPN,

55:28.680 --> 55:33.360
the simplest VPN installer designed for Raspberry Pis.

55:33.360 --> 55:34.760
Of course you'd like this.

55:35.880 --> 55:36.720
WireGuard.

55:36.720 --> 55:38.160
He just wanted an excuse to get another pie

55:38.160 --> 55:39.280
stuck in your IV somewhere.

55:39.280 --> 55:40.120
Exactly.

55:41.320 --> 55:43.040
And say WireGuard, you know,

55:43.040 --> 55:45.080
whenever I have an opportunity to say WireGuard.

55:45.080 --> 55:46.800
WireGuard, WireGuard.

55:46.800 --> 55:49.720
And it also actually supports OpenVPN as well,

55:49.720 --> 55:51.240
which turns out people still use.

55:51.240 --> 55:52.960
But this is kind of nice, right?

55:52.960 --> 55:56.360
It's OpenVPN or WireGuard on Raspbian.

55:56.360 --> 55:58.440
And it just walks you through all of it.

55:58.440 --> 55:59.320
Really simple.

55:59.320 --> 56:01.200
You can just, if you want,

56:01.200 --> 56:04.120
you can just curl a command,

56:04.120 --> 56:05.120
pipe it right into Bash,

56:05.120 --> 56:06.680
and you're off to the races.

56:07.880 --> 56:09.960
I only laugh because what could go wrong

56:09.960 --> 56:11.600
with those kinds of approaches.

56:11.600 --> 56:15.520
But it's a really neat idea for network level VPN.

56:15.520 --> 56:19.640
And seeing WireGuard get one step closer to implementation,

56:19.640 --> 56:21.480
you know, to make it a little bit easier to use WireGuard.

56:21.480 --> 56:23.760
This is more of that tooling on top to help it easy,

56:23.760 --> 56:24.600
make it easy.

56:24.600 --> 56:26.560
That's gonna make WireGuard magic when that happens.

56:26.560 --> 56:28.200
And this is one step towards that.

56:28.200 --> 56:29.880
It's when you can just forget that it's there at all.

56:29.880 --> 56:33.960
Yeah, kind of like, is it, what was the subspace?

56:33.960 --> 56:35.360
The application to...

56:35.360 --> 56:36.800
You know, there's a couple other ones now.

56:36.800 --> 56:37.640
Oh yeah?

56:37.640 --> 56:38.480
We should give them a try.

56:38.480 --> 56:39.320
Oh yeah?

56:39.320 --> 56:42.280
I'd like to because now that I've been like reloading

56:42.280 --> 56:44.760
all my systems, I don't have like any of my WireGuard

56:44.760 --> 56:45.600
stuff set up.

56:45.600 --> 56:46.520
Yeah, we should fix that.

56:46.520 --> 56:48.360
We should totally fix that.

56:48.360 --> 56:50.320
But Cheesy, you also have something for the folks

56:50.320 --> 56:51.360
that might be working at home

56:51.360 --> 56:53.640
and suffer with RSI like I do.

56:53.640 --> 56:54.760
It's called Break Timer.

56:54.760 --> 56:59.760
Yeah, so breaktimer.app is a great open source,

57:00.160 --> 57:03.920
basically break timer is exactly what it is.

57:03.920 --> 57:06.040
It's available for Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

57:06.040 --> 57:08.640
So if you're working at home and you're just glued

57:08.640 --> 57:11.400
to your screen, instead of getting up and taking a break,

57:11.400 --> 57:14.520
well, this is a super simple app that'll help you,

57:14.520 --> 57:16.480
that'll give you reminders to go take a break.

57:16.480 --> 57:20.280
So you can skip the reminders if you'd like.

57:20.280 --> 57:21.960
One of the things that I thought was really neat

57:21.960 --> 57:23.840
that I haven't seen some of these other apps do

57:23.840 --> 57:25.600
is the idle rest.

57:25.600 --> 57:29.320
So if there's no activity going on,

57:29.320 --> 57:32.140
you're not moving your mouse, you're not typing anything,

57:32.140 --> 57:34.800
the timer will restart itself

57:34.800 --> 57:36.320
whenever you get back to your machine.

57:36.320 --> 57:38.040
So say if you took your break,

57:38.040 --> 57:40.160
if you set your break for two minutes or whatever,

57:40.160 --> 57:42.960
and you come back in five minutes,

57:42.960 --> 57:44.680
your timer won't automatically start,

57:44.680 --> 57:46.240
your timer will start again

57:46.240 --> 57:49.040
as soon as you start being active on your machine.

57:49.040 --> 57:51.880
So really cool, really simple little app,

57:51.880 --> 57:55.000
you know, great looking little UI.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.040
You can schedule your work hours

57:57.040 --> 57:59.740
so it won't bug you when you're gaming on the weekends

57:59.740 --> 58:02.560
or something like that, but nice.

58:02.560 --> 58:05.400
I like that idle timer detection, that's clever.

58:05.400 --> 58:07.480
And of course it's GPL3, which is nice.

58:07.480 --> 58:09.360
It seems like just enough of a tool, you know,

58:09.360 --> 58:11.200
not too much, but just something to help you keep track

58:11.200 --> 58:13.000
and remind you to go stretch for a while.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.040
Yeah, I actually find this really useful when I'm editing.

58:16.040 --> 58:18.600
Yeah, that's an especially repetitive activity.

58:18.600 --> 58:21.120
Yeah, I get in the zone, I forget to take a break.

58:21.120 --> 58:23.560
I can imagine it's probably similar for developers.

58:23.560 --> 58:25.780
You get in the zone, you're really in the flow.

58:25.780 --> 58:26.620
You don't want to stop.

58:26.620 --> 58:28.080
That's the last thing you want to do is stop, yeah.

58:28.080 --> 58:30.160
And you can also have the notification be just,

58:30.160 --> 58:32.200
you know, a normal notification,

58:32.200 --> 58:36.520
or you can have it actually fill out your entire screen

58:36.520 --> 58:39.200
to say, start your break now, fool.

58:39.200 --> 58:41.600
And of course you can set your text as well, so.

58:41.600 --> 58:44.340
I would just go with the built-in notifications, you know,

58:44.340 --> 58:46.080
but I do like the full screen is like,

58:46.080 --> 58:47.680
if you really want to be heavy handed about it,

58:47.680 --> 58:49.840
be your own boss, you know?

58:49.840 --> 58:52.400
Good, go tell future self, do this.

58:52.400 --> 58:53.400
I'm making the rules.

58:53.400 --> 58:55.800
Yeah.

58:55.800 --> 58:57.600
I think that is actually a really good idea.

58:57.600 --> 58:58.800
So it's called Break Timer.

58:58.800 --> 59:02.080
So those are two picks for you, PyVPN and Break Timer.

59:02.080 --> 59:04.960
And of course, we'll have links to those and everything

59:04.960 --> 59:09.920
we've talked about at linuxunplug.com slash 345.

59:09.920 --> 59:11.920
And we'd love to have your feedback and ideas,

59:11.920 --> 59:13.960
linuxunplug.com slash contact.

59:13.960 --> 59:16.200
And join us in that ongoing conversation

59:16.200 --> 59:20.000
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash telegram.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.800
Anything you want to plug there, Mr. Westpain?

59:21.800 --> 59:25.160
Why don't you check out techsnap.systems?

59:25.160 --> 59:29.200
Wes and Jim Salter from Ars Technica breaking down things

59:29.200 --> 59:32.000
twice a month at techsnap.systems.

59:32.000 --> 59:35.040
I'll plug chrislast.com slash consulting.

59:35.040 --> 59:37.040
The hardest thing about launching a podcast now

59:37.040 --> 59:39.560
is actually making a podcast that stands out.

59:39.560 --> 59:41.800
I'm taking my 10-plus years of experience

59:41.800 --> 59:43.480
and helping people with their shows

59:43.480 --> 59:45.680
at chrislast.com slash consulting.

59:45.680 --> 59:46.840
Check that out.

59:46.840 --> 59:49.040
Of course, the show is live on Tuesdays.

59:49.040 --> 59:50.640
Join us live.

59:50.640 --> 59:52.000
Makes the show.

59:52.000 --> 59:52.760
Makes the show.

59:52.760 --> 59:55.440
Great mumble, great chat room, the best.

59:55.440 --> 59:58.600
People tell me Linux Unplugged has the best.

59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.800
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for your local time.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.900
And jblive.tv is where you can go to get the embedded

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:06.680
chat and the video.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:10.680
The audio, of course, released later at linuxunplug.com.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:15.880
The cleaned up, proper edition that has 99.9%

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.680
of the viewer and listenership is at linuxunplug.com.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:22.560
But if you want a little extra fun, that's the live stream.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.800
Either way, we appreciate you.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.560
Thanks for joining us.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.280
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:42.500
So until then, have a great week.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:05.640
You know, just something that's really cool about that Pi VPN, I don't know if you guys

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:12.600
noticed, but apparently it also works on Amazon's free tier using Ubuntu or Debian.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.600
So if you're-

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.600
That's adorable.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.880
Yeah, if you need that AWS free tier, set you up some Ubuntu, some Debian, throw some

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.300
Pi VPN on top, man, you got you a good meal.

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:25.960
You could do like a cooking show version of putting services together.

01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:35.560
If you take a dash of Ansible, with a little sprinkle of Ansible, maybe a dash of salt.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:38.040
No Ansible is the recipe, of course, right?

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:42.840
Well, you use your Ansible, you make sure your thing has a dash of salt in it just to,

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.800
you know, make sure everything's all gravy.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:51.640
And I'm curious, can we get like just, can I get a sample consulting tip for free from

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:52.640
Chris Les?

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:53.640
Yeah, absolutely.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:02:00.560
What would be your free giveaway, like free trial, click on my link, and this is what

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.560
you get.

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:02.560
Don't launch a podcast.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:08.080
I think that's a great idea.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.080
But how about cheesy?

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:12.920
I mean, if I was going to like consult with you, you know, so you and I are going to have

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:13.920
a call.

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.960
The way it works is, of course, is first, if you had a podcast, I get links from you

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.320
and I do like a full review.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.320
I'd listen to your show, I look at your site, I look at how you distribute the podcast,

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:25.560
I look at your feed, I look at your social presence, I look at your show notes, I look

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.080
at how you get audience feedback.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:30.280
I mean, I go all in like, like, you know, I would do for one of our shows.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.280
And then we have the call.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.560
And I tell you what you're doing right, I tell you what you're doing wrong.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:38.800
But for you, what I would tell you is, well, number one, you've got a great design sense.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.120
So you could really launch something that has a real visual style.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:47.280
But secondarily, I think you could clearly own that beer slash Linux space, you know,

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.660
the Venn diagram where beer and Linux cross, you could completely own that market.

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:55.120
And if you launched a podcast, I would definitely recommend for you.

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.120
It's beers with Linux.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.120
Nice.

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.520
I feel reminded of something that you did long ago.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.800
Yeah, beer is quite tasty.

01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:02.800
Beer is quite tasty.

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:06.680
Well, Chris, I forgot to talk to you about scale.

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:07.680
Oh, yeah.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.680
Oh, totally.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.680
I'd love to hear.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.680
I'd love to hear.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.680
Hold on.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:16.080
Do you want to do the official Jill, our reporter on the scene from scale?

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.720
Well, we'll pretend like you're on the scene, okay?

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.720
Because obviously, you're no longer.

01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:19.720
Okay.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:20.720
All right, very good.

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.720
Let's go.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.720
We'll go first.

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:23.720
We'll bring in our star reporter.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.720
Oh, my gosh, it's Anderson Cooper, everybody.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.480
Ladies and gentlemen, reporting on the scene in California, it is Jill, the Linux girl

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.720
on our scale live stream.

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.560
Jill, what are you learning at scale 2020?

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:48.840
Oh, what's been awesome is because of unfortunately, because of the virus, we had a very small

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.760
community like feel at scale, which was awesome.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:57.640
It was kind of like scale six years ago, but one of the highlights was seeing Elle do her

01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.520
talk on confessions of assisted men.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.080
Oh, that's a good time.

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.080
Yeah.

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.080
Yes.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.080
It was really good.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.080
It was the first time she had done it alone.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.080
Oh, yeah.

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.080
Yeah.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:15.640
It was really, really nice to get to talk to Elle, Elle Moore outside of Twitter and

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:22.040
Jupiter broadcasting, so that was wonderful, but yeah, so even though a lot of the big

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:27.320
companies weren't there, they couldn't send their people out, but they were still sponsoring

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.320
the event.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.320
Oh, that's good.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:35.080
But as a result, they sent to the booths, they sent all the local community there.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:42.360
So it was probably pretty much 50% of Los Angelenos because of that.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.360
Really?

01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:44.360
Yeah.

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:45.360
It sounds like it was kind of a special scale then.

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:46.360
Yeah, it was.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.360
It was.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:53.160
It really felt like scale was about, like I was saying, six or seven years ago, but

01:04:53.160 --> 01:05:00.160
we still had, even though normally we have over 5,000 in attendance, we still had 3,500,

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:01.880
which was really, really good.

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.360
That is not, I mean, so that's about half, right?

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.360
Yeah.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.360
Yeah.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.360
Okay.

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.360
Yeah.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.360
So what are the expo hall?

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:10.480
You know where all the booths are?

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.600
How different was that?

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:18.800
Set in about 40%, which was a little weird because we're used to seeing that, as you

01:05:18.800 --> 01:05:22.000
know, Chris, that whole hall just completely full.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Right.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.600
But we still had a lot of people.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:29.080
Like I had a lot of people coming to the Linux Chicks LA booth, and I still was able to get

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:34.800
a lot of good interviews for Linux game cast, which, and LWW.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:45.280
So it was just, it really, everyone was very careful to not touch each other's hands.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:48.920
We were trying as much to do fist bumps and shoulder bumps.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:49.920
Really?

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:50.920
Getting creative.

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.720
So it must have been like an ongoing conversation the entire conference.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.400
Yes, it was.

01:05:55.400 --> 01:06:01.600
And the fact that we were the only tech conference that hadn't been canceled and was still going

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:06.840
on, and I know if scale had happened the next week, we would have been canceled, you know,

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:07.840
of course.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:14.800
So, but it was a very wonderful event despite what's going on in the world.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:20.840
And what was also really cool is a lot of the speakers who had canceled, people filled

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:28.360
in for them at the last minute, like the Kubernetes track was really awesome because the whole

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.340
track was going to be canceled.

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:34.560
And then everyone, you know, everyone said, well, well, I can come in and do the talk

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.360
literally like, you know, the day before.

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:43.400
So it was, it turned out, I didn't go to that track, but everyone said it was wonderful

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:45.760
as a result of the spontaneity.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.960
That's nice.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:49.560
It's cool to see people step up like that, you know, I know about that.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:50.560
I could talk about that.

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:52.360
I wasn't planning to, but I'll do it.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:55.040
Yeah, that was just really cool.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:07:01.700
And it was, you know, again, it was really great to talk to Elmore and Nuritzi Sanchez

01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:02.700
as well.

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.600
I got to talk with her and she was wonderful.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.440
Her brunch with Brent was great too.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.440
Yes.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:14.180
In fact, oh man, I meant to mention that in the housekeeping, the last few brunches with

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:15.960
Brent have been so killer.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:16.960
Definitely.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:17.960
Yeah.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:18.960
Oh gosh.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:22.760
Well, you know, has it crossed your mind that might be the last tech event of the year

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:23.760
you attend?

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:24.760
Yeah.

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:30.040
Because I wanted to go to Linux Fest Northwest, of course, and was planning to and was just

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.680
about ready to look into the trains.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:34.400
Oh, nice way to do it.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.400
Good for you.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.400
Yeah.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.400
Yeah.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.400
But next year for sure.

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.400
Yeah.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.920
Or if it's put off to the who knows, it might happen the end of the year.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:42.920
Yeah.

01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:43.920
You never know.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.920
Some of them might reschedule.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.800
I feel like most of them probably won't.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:47.800
Yeah.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:48.800
Unfortunately.

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.280
The year without a conference.

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.280
What about OSCON?

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:54.520
Would you would you consider going to OSCON if it continues in July?

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.520
Yeah.

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:59.040
OSCON actually is one I've never been to.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:04.080
And the irony of it is scale is bigger than OSCON normally.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.920
You could take the train to OSCON, though.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:06.920
Yes, you can.

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:07.920
Yeah.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.400
So I've been wanting to go there.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.280
Well, we'll see what happens.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:16.000
You know, it seems like every week it is an entirely different world we're living in right

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
now.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.560
History is being made as we as we live right now.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.560
Yeah.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.440
But it's so awesome that our penguins are still marching.

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:24.860
You know, we still had scale.

01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:26.760
We still have the Linux community.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:29.560
And it's been my my respite and all this madness.

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.560
True.

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.120
And we have our virtual look.

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.120
Yes.

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.120
Yes.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.120
And Jupiter Broadcasting.

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.120
Yay.

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.120
Oh, oh, and it was so cool.

01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:39.640
A couple people came up to me that had heard my brunch with Brent.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:40.640
Oh, that's wonderful.

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:46.360
And what was really sweet is is one of the Jupiter Broadcasting listeners.

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:49.680
He wanted a picture with me.

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:50.680
Who wouldn't?

01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:51.680
Yeah, that's true.

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:53.840
I wish I could have gotten a picture this year.

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:54.840
Yeah.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.840
Next year, Chris, for sure.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:56.840
OK.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:57.840
You promise?

01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:58.840
Yes, I promise.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:21.840
Yes, I promise.
