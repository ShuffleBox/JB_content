1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Now, before we start, I was wondering if I could get Wimpy to tell us about, I think

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,880
Wimpy spent the morning, or actually for him, he spent the afternoon evening at a makerspace.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,880
Is that true, Wimpy?

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,160
I have, yes.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,920
And tell me about this.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,720
This sounds pretty cool.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,480
So this is a new makerspace that is, we don't actually have a space yet, we're just a bunch

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,680
of makers right now.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:30,160
So in my local area, I live in an area called Basingstoke and Dean.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,480
So this is Bad Hack, is our makerspace.

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,840
That's awesome.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,240
This is like the third meeting, I've been to the last two, and we're just sort of drumming

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,640
up members and figuring out who's got what skills and we're doing little presentations

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,560
and show and tells and things, figuring out some projects that we're going to work on,

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:58,320
and also looking for somewhere that could be a permanent facility that's open 24 seven,

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,960
so that people can just go there and work on projects whenever it suits them.

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,640
And this evening was good because we've sort of reached out to the craft makers in the

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,640
community.

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,840
So we had a load of people that do crochet and knitting and also textile crafts there

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,840
this evening.

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,200
So we've got quite a broad range of skills now to go with all the software and hardware

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,040
engineers and roboticists and electronics and PCB design guys.

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,200
So we've got a good spectrum of skills.

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,600
So we're starting to think up some group projects we can work on, which will be fun.

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,960
I feel you're making me feel like the worst.

26
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,160
I was invited to a local makerspace where they're building an open source car, which

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,240
has got to be cool.

28
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,440
And I couldn't make it work.

29
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,880
I couldn't get the timing right.

30
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,440
I wasn't able to go, but now I kind of want to email them back because this looks like

31
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,440
a lot of fun.

32
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,040
That's a bit more ambitious than our first projects.

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,160
Well, you've got to start somewhere.

34
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
Yeah.

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,480
We're going to have a go at making a 3D scanner because one of the guys in the makerspace

36
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,120
runs a 3D printing business.

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:08,680
So we thought we'd have a go at making a 3D scanner using a make our own rotating table

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,880
with Microsoft connectors, the scanning eye.

39
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,840
How much of the open source ethos is alive and well in a space like this?

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,040
Is there a tendency towards open source and Linux, or is it more about building the thing

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,560
and less about what software you're using?

42
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,040
Yeah, I'd say the latter.

43
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,680
So people are aware of what open source is.

44
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,120
What I quite like is there's quite a lot of the older generation there, sort of people

45
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,360
that have worked in electronics all their careers and have recently retired.

46
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,240
So they still refer to everything as Unix, but the fact that they know Unix is encouraging.

47
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,440
So people know about Linux and open source.

48
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,120
Some of them dabble with it and use it.

49
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,200
Obviously Raspberry Pi is prevalent, so they're all kind of aware.

50
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,520
But yes, they're very practical in the way they use things.

51
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,620
So it's just a tool.

52
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,760
So if Windows does the job better, so the prototype 3D scanner is using Windows 10 at

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,440
the moment, I intend to change that, but it runs Windows 10 at the moment.

54
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,440
That's because it was easy for them to do it.

55
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:20,760
So there is some awareness, but it isn't the core running through the group at all, I would

56
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,760
say.

57
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,920
I'm the only person that is really invested in open source.

58
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,200
Really what you're saying is that your work is definitely cut out for you.

59
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:50,360
This is Linux Unplugged episode 175 for December 13th, 2016.

60
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,980
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that just can't avoid feeling that

61
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,120
holiday spirit.

62
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,120
My name is Chris.

63
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,120
My name is Wes.

64
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,480
Wes, you got a mug in your hands too.

65
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,360
It looks like you're sipping on like some cocoa.

66
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Some can pretend.

67
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,000
You could bring up the eight-hour YouTube fireplace on the screen there.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,320
It'd really feel festive in here.

69
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,880
I'm sure the MoMa Room would just love that.

70
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
That's not what we're here to talk about today.

71
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,200
We're not here to talk about that, although maybe in the post-show.

72
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
You never know.

73
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
It can go crazy.

74
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Stick around.

75
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,680
But coming up on this week's episode, there is huge, huge news from the Nextcloud project.

76
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,180
We'll highlight some of that.

77
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,600
And then the Plasma desktop, it's going to be getting all up in that Nextcloud.

78
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,160
You're not going to believe the kind of stuff they're thinking about integrating in the

79
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,320
Plasma desktop.

80
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,760
McAfee's making your Linux box way more vulnerable.

81
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,360
Linus himself is feeling the holiday spirit and we'll tell you about the present he's

82
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,840
dropping before Christmas.

83
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,720
My buddies at Crossover have big news.

84
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,920
There's a big security thing to talk about.

85
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:47,720
And then I want to discuss the completely ridiculous, irresponsible, and maybe even

86
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,640
dangerous collaboration happening between distros.

87
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,000
If this kind of stuff happens, we're going to start getting results and stop wasting

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
time.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And I can't stand for it.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,520
What are we going to come on here and rant about?

91
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,600
So we're going to take it to Ikey and Wimpy later on in the show and ask them why they're

92
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,200
doing so much damn good work and what the hell is going on with all this collaboration.

93
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:12,640
And then after that, Google announced their plans today to kill Linux on Internet of Things.

94
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,360
They're looking at Ubuntu snappy.

95
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,160
They're looking at all of the efforts by different projects out there to create a free open platform

96
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
for Internet of Things.

97
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:29,120
And Google says, no, no, let us introduce, let us suggest, let us perhaps recommend that

98
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,240
instead you deploy Android of Things.

99
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,840
Android of Things is Google's new Internet of Things platform and the name is horrible

100
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,720
and we'll tell you about their plans to try to crush the competition on Internet of Things,

101
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,760
which I think they could have something there.

102
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
They could.

103
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,160
I think they looked over at what Canonical is doing right now with IoT devices and they

104
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,880
went, shit, we better get rid of this.

105
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
What was that called?

106
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,480
It sounded like a kitchen, like a brassel or I can't remember what it was called, but

107
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,720
it was essentially an Internet of Things platform that also used Weave, their mesh networking,

108
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
and it didn't go anywhere.

109
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
Brillo, thank you.

110
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
Brillo, yes.

111
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,560
Look at Micah68 in the chat room, nailing it.

112
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,720
Yeah, so they had Brillo and Brillo hasn't worked out.

113
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,480
Now we're going to discuss the pivot to Android or Android of Things or whatever it's called.

114
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:19,600
But let's start with some actual really awesome Linux news and project updates, huge news

115
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,360
from Nextcloud and all of that, and it just would be inappropriate to go any further without

116
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,080
saying time-appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

117
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Hello.

118
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,080
Greetings, programs.

119
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Hello.

120
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
Hi.

121
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,080
Hello, everyone.

122
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,040
So very, very excited and I'm hoping Joss will come on the Linux Action Show this Sunday

123
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,300
to give us the real inside scoop, but I'm very excited to say that Nextcloud 11 is out

124
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,040
and it looks like a really kick butt release.

125
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,520
First of all, off the top of my head, the thing that I'm most excited about is two-factor

126
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,480
authentication support.

127
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,000
That's really big for me because the whole reason I want to use Nextcloud is because

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,400
I want something that I don't trust putting in Google or other cloud services, which means

129
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,800
it's something I really care about.

130
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
Security is important.

131
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Yeah.

132
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,500
So they also have support for new browsers, Kerberos authentication, two-factor authentication

133
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,160
and time-based one-time passwords.

134
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:12,720
They have also expanded the brute force protection on all API access points, which is brilliant,

135
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,360
and they've made Federation more secure by better use of SSL and TLS.

136
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
Excellent.

137
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,440
And they're making sure their app store automatically checks apps and enforces their signatures.

138
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,720
So you're getting legitimate apps.

139
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,800
These do sound like quite a number, you know, a nice layer of security polish on the top,

140
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,880
especially when this is the kind of service that you very well might want to expose publicly

141
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,120
so that you can access from anywhere.

142
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,480
Also look at this stat.

143
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:41,320
This release, Nextcloud 11, decreases database load by up to 80% and improves response time

144
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,840
by 60% for common server app operations.

145
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,840
They've also …

146
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
That's true.

147
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,520
They have also combined multi-bucket object store support.

148
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,600
Now, don't worry what that means.

149
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,780
Wait till the next story.

150
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,560
Improved handling of previews in Collabra Online, so they've sped up the online document

151
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
stuff.

152
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,160
This is really interesting, including a lot of nice improvements to backend searching.

153
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,360
So yeah, I'm hoping to dig in …

154
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,640
Yeah, full-text search now.

155
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
That's great.

156
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
Yeah.

157
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
I'm hoping to dig in with Joss and try it out myself.

158
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,080
Wimpy, is this the version … Yeah, it was Wimpy before the show.

159
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,240
You said you tried out Nextcloud just recently, right?

160
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,760
I've just installed it this afternoon.

161
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,720
Was it 11, by chance?

162
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,880
Well, when I installed it … So I've installed it in a slightly unusual fashion, which is

163
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,840
why I've written up a blog post about it, which I've sent you a link to.

164
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
I see that.

165
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
I'll put it up.

166
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,080
So I recently ordered the Nextcloud box, and that arrived.

167
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,360
And I only had Raspberry Pi 3's, a spare, whereas the image that comes with the kit

168
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,240
only supports the Raspberry Pi 2.

169
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:50,680
So I have installed Ubuntu Core on a Raspberry Pi 3 in the Nextcloud box, and documented

170
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,600
how to install the Nextcloud snap on that, and access the one terabyte hard disk using

171
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Ubuntu Core.

172
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,400
And I can confirm that it works, because I followed his guide about an hour ago, and

173
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,600
it works perfectly.

174
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,920
What is the process of installing Nextcloud from a snap?

175
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,080
What does that involve?

176
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
Snap install Nextcloud.

177
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Oh, that's nice.

178
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,560
Interesting.

179
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:22,640
And I've just been talking to the maintainer of the Nextcloud snap, and Nextcloud 11 is

180
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,120
in the candidate channel in the snap store, and will move to stable very soon now.

181
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,880
And I've just refreshed my install, and I'm now running Nextcloud 11.

182
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
Interesting.

183
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,120
And what are your thoughts so far?

184
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,880
I don't know enough about Nextcloud to comment on that.

185
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,160
Well, just a general setup and use.

186
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,640
What are your thoughts?

187
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,080
Well, yeah, it's great.

188
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,160
Logged into the website, and the web UI thing, and turned on the bits and pieces I needed

189
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,480
to access the one terabyte drive, and turned on some extra apps like contacts and calendars.

190
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,080
And I've imported my contacts and my calendars, and I've got those synced to a tablet.

191
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,080
Nice.

192
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,360
And all of that was really easy, and I've turned on my wife's phone when you take a

193
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,680
photo or a video, automatically upload it, and that works as well.

194
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,160
So so far, so good.

195
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
I'm very pleased.

196
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:21,120
But this is like, I literally started this last night and finished it at lunchtime today.

197
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,360
So it's all very new to me, but I'm very pleased so far.

198
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
It's looking good.

199
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,680
It's certainly the best experience I've had.

200
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,440
Last time I tried own cloud was like own cloud eight, and it still wasn't working right for

201
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
me at that point.

202
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,960
But this looks much, much closer to what I need.

203
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:43,280
I'll follow with some interest your thoughts and just sort of overall feedback on how the

204
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,840
syncing works, too, as you get a chance to play with that.

205
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:52,020
And those features that you mentioned from Nextcloud 11, in terms of reducing the database

206
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,960
overhead and everything, that will be great for running it on something small like the

207
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Pi 3.

208
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,120
That could make a significant difference.

209
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,320
So yes, that'll be terrific.

210
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,820
Poby, what's your experience been?

211
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,280
You know, just a little bit of time you've had with it so far, the UI, overall feel of

212
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,080
it and all that.

213
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,680
So the only negative thing I have is the fact it's a bit slow on the Raspberry Pi, but I'm

214
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,400
hoping that some of these performance improvements you've said are in own cloud 11 will help.

215
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,960
But I'm not expecting magic, you know, magic instant 10 times performance improvement.

216
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,400
But I'm planning initially just to use it for the photo sync.

217
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,580
I want to be able to have the photos from my phone and my kids to be able to take photos

218
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,920
and it just automatically sync to the Nextcloud box.

219
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,640
So I followed Martin's guide.

220
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,760
I only used the Pi 2 because it was the only thing I had kicking around, like, you know,

221
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,760
first world problems.

222
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,360
I've only got Pi 2 and I'll install the Nextcloud client on each of their machines and have them

223
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,680
sync in all their stuff and do that over Christmas, should be good fun, but yeah, I found it works

224
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,680
really well.

225
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,360
And I love the fact that I can just go snap install Nextcloud.

226
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,560
There's a little bit of faff to do SSL, but it's only like a couple of lines.

227
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
There's not a lot to it.

228
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,080
And there was only a couple of lines to paste in to do to mount the one terabyte hard drive.

229
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,040
So it wasn't really an awful lot of work.

230
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,920
And thanks a lot, Martin, for doing that work.

231
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,000
Because I basically just copy and pasted stuff into a terminal and it worked.

232
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That's great.

233
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, you shouldn't do that.

234
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,360
Even the author says that.

235
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,960
Make sure you try his next article.

236
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
No malicious intent.

237
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
I'm trustworthy, apparently.

238
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,300
Well, none of them had sudo in front of them.

239
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,300
So I feel okay.

240
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,300
There you go.

241
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:32,240
Yeah, I think the two things that I also think about, like the planner of the Federation,

242
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,720
so I can have a local Nextcloud instance and maybe like a droplet ones where I would hit

243
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,720
from my phone.

244
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,240
It's a little faster.

245
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
All that kind of stuff.

246
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
There's a lot of possibilities there.

247
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,400
This is NextStory is what could push me over the edge, big time.

248
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,140
This is so awesome.

249
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,480
It fits with things you've been flirting with lately.

250
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,520
So the Plasma folks have been discussing further integration with Nextcloud.

251
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,840
And disclaimer, I think they're more discussing having a common API that would work with own

252
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,380
cloud and Nextcloud.

253
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,880
And they're talking to both projects about that.

254
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,660
But the people they met with was Frank and others from Nextcloud.

255
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,760
So that's obviously sort of how this is framed.

256
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,280
It's written by Joss from Nextcloud.

257
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:18,080
This is a feature that has been discussed is the synchronization of settings, like passwords

258
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,480
and file metadata over to the Nextcloud server.

259
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,800
From an implementation point of view, the latest Nextcloud features a key value store,

260
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,600
which could be used to store client settings.

261
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,480
This is the same way that iCloud works.

262
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,260
When you're an iCloud developer, you can store application settings in iCloud using an iCloud

263
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,120
key value store system.

264
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,680
So this would be a key value store system that you could use to store the client settings

265
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,120
of the Plasma desktop.

266
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,520
Another area they say is they could also do the syncing of tags, ratings, and comments

267
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,320
from applications in the file manager, which kind of blows my mind.

268
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,320
And then, of course, being able to just offer general file sync integrated into the file

269
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
manager.

270
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,960
So they say the most important part would be to write the online accounts module, which

271
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,840
Noam actually has this part done, where you could set up Nextcloud to begin with.

272
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,680
And then they want to evaluate how setting up Nextcloud could then be potentially automatically

273
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,020
set up with the KDE PIM software.

274
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:20,200
So your Nextcloud calendar works in your local Plasma desktop calendar.

275
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,640
And also you could potentially, if you wanted to and they implemented it, use the Plasma

276
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,880
desktop search to not only search your Plasma desktop, but also the Nextcloud server for

277
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:31,880
files.

278
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Wow.

279
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,880
Oh, that is cool.

280
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
Yeah.

281
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
That is pretty slick.

282
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,760
So, you know, not only is this a way to synchronize your settings in a way that feels like it

283
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,880
should be pretty good since it'd be supported and built into the desktop environment, but

284
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,400
you could keep it completely private, this is what it should be.

285
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,520
This kind of collaboration and this kind of communication and this kind of, hey, you're

286
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,000
doing this really well and we're doing this pretty good.

287
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,200
Why don't we, why don't you just do what you do best and we'll do what we do best because

288
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,120
these guys could have gone with some sort of crazy Plasma online that's $9.99 a year

289
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,440
that does all of this for you.

290
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,320
They could have done something like that.

291
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,320
This is genius.

292
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,780
And I would love to see this happen.

293
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,120
And I would love to see other desktops go, wait, what are they cooking over there?

294
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
Yeah.

295
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
What are they cooking?

296
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
Maybe, maybe I should do some of that.

297
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
Maybe I should do that.

298
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,120
I don't know.

299
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
I think that's pretty cool.

300
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,800
I think that would be really solid.

301
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,760
I'm going to try to put, I think I have recorded Wimpy's new settings sync solution.

302
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,180
I'll try to get that put in the post-show so that way if you guys are curious, stick

303
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,480
around for the post-show where Wimpy discusses how he's doing this essentially today.

304
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,520
But this would be baked into the desktop level.

305
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,640
Would you be tempted to give it a shot?

306
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
Yeah.

307
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,640
I mean, I think so.

308
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,620
I don't know if I would use it long-term or not, but with this number of like that kind

309
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,120
of integration, if I've already got all of my environment settings and then you can,

310
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,260
you already have it there syncing, so why not put your dot files on it?

311
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,940
Why not put in everything that you need that you want to carry with you?

312
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:59,600
You pull up a new laptop, you install Plasma, you get the settings configured and boom,

313
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
you're rolling.

314
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
That sounds awesome.

315
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Yeah.

316
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,160
And if you do one login and all your settings syncs and your file syncs set up, this for

317
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,160
me makes like investing, even if Nextcloud does have a few issues, like I could build

318
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,880
backup systems around that, like I can figure out ways, especially if I can take in regular

319
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,440
snapshots before updates and whatnot, like there are ways to mitigate any potential downfall

320
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,840
I might find if they get to this level of integration.

321
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,680
And if the other desktops ever consider this, or even if just the file manager project implemented

322
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,720
this or a few other projects do this, this would be huge.

323
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,460
I love it.

324
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,460
So you can find out more.

325
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,880
There's not a lot of meat to it yet because none of the work has been done.

326
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,320
This is all just theoretical.

327
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,500
They don't even have the common API yet, so it's not really all that close.

328
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,920
One other story just because I don't really think it affects a lot of us, but I think

329
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,520
we'll all collectively like to roll our eyes.

330
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Get ready.

331
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
Get ready.

332
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,680
Do one preparatory blink and now roll your eyes.

333
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:03,340
McAfee Virus Scanner is allowing remote code execution as root on Linux.

334
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,080
So when you get that virus scanner that you don't need for your Linux box, taking up resources

335
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:12,120
that you don't really have available, scanning files for the Windows users, it turns out

336
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,360
that if you have the Intel McAfee Virus Scan Enterprise for Linux, it can be compromised

337
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,480
by remote attackers due to a number of security vulnerabilities.

338
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,920
Not one, not two.

339
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,180
Some of these vulnerabilities can be chained together to allow remote code execution as

340
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,180
root.

341
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,180
Oh no.

342
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,180
Yeah.

343
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:36,160
So basically everything they've released from 2015 till now has the vulnerability.

344
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,640
The only difference from the older release appears to be updating a newer version of

345
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,400
Lib C, which makes exploiting these vulnerabilities even easier.

346
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Oh boy.

347
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Yikes.

348
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Yeah.

349
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,200
So that's what's up.

350
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
And now it's out in the wild.

351
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,560
It's known about.

352
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,080
There are CVEs and all that to track.

353
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,680
So you've probably already been informed about this if you run it.

354
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,520
But they also have a rundown.

355
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
It is 10 vulnerabilities.

356
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,520
10.

357
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,520
Dang.

358
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Yeah.

359
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Each one got its own CVE.

360
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
So that's brilliant.

361
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,040
And the other thing that's just wonderful and it's so great because before I say this,

362
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,400
you're not going to be too shocked when I say it, but you have to remember in the context

363
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,280
in which this product is sold.

364
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,500
This is sold as a security product to run on your enterprise servers that are connected

365
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,080
to the internet to make them more secure.

366
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,120
It is implicitly sold to make your server more secure.

367
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,880
And so when you are designing enterprise software, it's not shareware, it's not $9, it's hundreds

368
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,520
of thousands even with yearly annual subscriptions and support.

369
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,100
And you are designing an application to be sold in this environment.

370
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,000
You build it for security.

371
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,880
And the way, just basic way you could start that is run the individual services as unprivileged

372
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
users.

373
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
But not McAfee.

374
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,880
Nope.

375
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Nope.

376
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,880
Not one folks, but two separate services running as root and only one running as an unprivileged

377
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,880
user called Nails.

378
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,880
Nails.

379
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,920
And the great thing is the main scanner service runs as root and listens on a local Unix socket.

380
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,840
So that's beautiful.

381
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,760
So if you get on the box, if you use any other vulnerability to get local access to any of

382
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,800
the other nine, if you use any of the other nine vulnerabilities to get local access to

383
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,760
the box, you then can just access the local web server, the server web server listening

384
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,240
on local host running as root, which is brilliant.

385
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,760
Then the main scanner service also runs as root.

386
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,120
That's just brilliant.

387
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,440
And then the web servers, there's another web server that runs as the user Nails also

388
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,920
listening on 0.0.0 on port 55443.

389
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,660
Inner process communication is basically a web server that sits on top of other pieces

390
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,660
underneath it.

391
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,720
And when the user makes a request to the web server, the request is reformatted and sent

392
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
to the root service.

393
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,560
And then the user is shown the response rendered in an HTML template.

394
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,800
The web interface doesn't do much to limit what data a malicious user could send to the

395
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
root service.

396
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,460
So you can, you could probably figure out a way to just use the web service, whatever

397
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,600
you want in there, and it'll just pass it right along to the thing running as root.

398
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Just passes it right.

399
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Here you go.

400
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Here you go.

401
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Right.

402
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
It is Ryan.

403
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
Yeah, it's just brilliant.

404
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,640
It's built as a product to make your Linux enterprise servers more secure with the intention

405
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,880
these boxes are likely connected to the web or, you know, because they're mail servers

406
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,440
and things like that.

407
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,640
And this is what they do.

408
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,000
Crazy.

409
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,600
Well, expected though.

410
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,840
Don't don't if you're going to run antivirus on Linux, just use Clam antivirus.

411
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,840
All right.

412
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Do me a favor.

413
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,840
Do you a favor.

414
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,840
Don't make Chris mad.

415
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,040
Don't don't spend thousands and thousands of dollars to McAfee.

416
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,240
Go do a donation to the Clam AV project and call it good.

417
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,120
Clam AV has been around for years.

418
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,600
It gets updated like nobody's business.

419
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,000
It's easy to integrate.

420
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,440
It doesn't have a ton of overhead compared to these things.

421
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,400
And it's open source.

422
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,160
You just I mean, it's just there is not a competitive market.

423
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
I don't know why.

424
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,320
I don't like I've seen this before.

425
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,420
I've seen people asking about antivirus before.

426
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,240
If you must run antivirus, use Clam Clam AV.

427
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,360
And if you need to spend money on antivirus, give a donation to the Clam AV project.

428
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,360
Problem solved.

429
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
All right.

430
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
Hmm.

431
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Go ahead.

432
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
Yes.

433
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:12,040
I have found several third party Clam AV virus repositories.

434
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:17,480
There's one that I'm using on my personal squid proxy at home.

435
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,160
Oh, you scan all the data.

436
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,160
How do you know it's a legit the third party?

437
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,160
How do you know?

438
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
Like, how do you find these?

439
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,860
And how do you know they're OK to use?

440
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:33,680
This one I they have paid repository parts and they mentioned something about I think

441
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,280
U.S. government using them or something like that.

442
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
This is like a business.

443
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,920
This is like a this is like a way they generate revenue.

444
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
Yes.

445
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
Oh, OK.

446
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Interesting.

447
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,280
So they're like a curator for Clam AV databases.

448
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,720
And can you use multiple Clam AV database sources?

449
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
You should.

450
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,240
All it is is adding into the Clam as the fresh Clam config.

451
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,240
Yeah.

452
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,240
Fresh Clam.

453
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,240
That's right.

454
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
That's right.

455
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,240
Yep.

456
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,240
Wow.

457
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,240
It's been a long time.

458
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
So that is that is really interesting.

459
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
I don't think I ever got down that far in the rabbit hole when I messed around with Clam

460
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
AV.

461
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Thankfully.

462
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
I just set up a cron job.

463
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,000
Let me see if I can find the website and I'll link it to you guys in the IRC.

464
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,680
Yeah, of course.

465
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,360
Like Ike says, you can still charge for open source.

466
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,760
Of course, Clam AV could choose to sell it if they wanted to.

467
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
They just don't.

468
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,320
It's just right there in your repo.

469
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
I love it.

470
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,400
There's a lot of value adds like we're seeing here.

471
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,820
That is really a thing, though.

472
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,680
Just those root services, Wes, that really runs as root and then claims to make your

473
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,680
computer more secure.

474
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,680
Just I know.

475
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
Right.

476
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
And walk away.

477
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
Walk away.

478
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,640
I mean, I mean, I only run as root, but that's because I know what I'm doing.

479
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,160
You know what you're doing.

480
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,560
You meant to delete those files.

481
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
Yeah.

482
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,560
Didn't want them anymore.

483
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
Oh, man.

484
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,320
You know what I get grumpy at, actually?

485
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,160
This is such a first world problem.

486
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,800
But like when I had this is such a first world problem.

487
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,120
But when I have like a lot of packages to update and I pseudoed and then sometime during

488
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,520
the build of an AOR package or something, the pseudo time window is expired.

489
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,840
And then the package just sits there waiting while I reenter the password.

490
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,520
Usually because I've walked away, I come back and then it's timed out again.

491
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,160
And now it's asking for the root password.

492
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,760
And I'm like, I don't I don't know.

493
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,160
I never log in as root.

494
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,480
I set up some crazy password I generated like, oh, come on.

495
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
Can't you remember?

496
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,280
So I'm always tempted to just pseudo the whole session.

497
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,200
But then, of course, now now the package manager is yelling at me.

498
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,080
You really shouldn't run this as root.

499
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,240
To run this as root, you must do tack tack and come on.

500
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,320
It's like it's like my it's like the way my truck beeps at me when I'm driving down my

501
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,960
driveway to empty my garbage can.

502
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,920
It's like, you don't have your seatbelt on.

503
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,240
You don't have a seatbelt on.

504
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,240
I know.

505
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
It knows best.

506
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
Just trust the system.

507
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,280
Oh, man.

508
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,480
Speaking of the system, help break the system.

509
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,800
The duopoly that is the mobile industry.

510
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:47,840
Go over to linux.ting.com and sign up for mobile that makes sense.

511
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,780
This is a gift you could give because the SIM cards are like nine dollars.

512
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,380
The phones are they have a whole range of phones starting like 20 bucks after you go

513
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,440
to linux.ting.com all the way up to the Cadillacs.

514
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,040
Linux.ting.com will take twenty five dollars off a device or give you service credit in

515
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,800
twenty five dollars if you bring a phone or a tablet.

516
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,860
I was just this is going to be a funny story.

517
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,560
So this is I have just last week.

518
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:17,480
I have a new use for Ting, which I've had when I got ages ago, I got an old iPad like

519
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,300
air or something.

520
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,400
It's like the first iPad Air.

521
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,920
And this is what I'm using when I fly my DGI drone.

522
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,160
So I have a nice big screen to view the DGI drone on.

523
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,720
Here's the thing, Wes.

524
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,800
There are regions like where the studio is at that are restricted air and I have to sign

525
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,520
in and authorize myself before I can fly in that area.

526
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,020
And you've got to have data.

527
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,720
So here I am like a jerk out in the freezing temperatures with my drone and I can't take

528
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,200
off, I can't fly because I don't have I don't have data on my iPad.

529
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
So that took about 30 hot seconds to fix.

530
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,720
So I get a SIM card from Ting.

531
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,240
I put it in the iPad.

532
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,800
It's six dollars a month for the line.

533
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,400
I never pay for phone minutes.

534
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,260
I never pay for text messages.

535
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,080
And for the once a week, this thing has to hit the cellular tower to authorize a login

536
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
token.

537
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,020
I will pay for the, you know, I mean, I'm not I'm nothing basically.

538
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,060
And if I if I was a new customer, if I went to Linux.ting.com and I signed up for a device

539
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:15,960
like this, just like a tablet that has like a LTE connection as a backup, you probably

540
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,240
wouldn't even use that first twenty five dollars for a couple of months.

541
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,840
It's just six dollars for the line.

542
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,400
And then your usage on top of that.

543
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,200
And there's no contract nor the termination fee.

544
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,400
They got great customer service, CDMA and GSM networks to choose from.

545
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,200
I know it's so cool.

546
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,980
And they have great tech tips and tricks on their blog and often things about giveaways

547
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,980
and whatnot.

548
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,280
So check it out.

549
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,600
Go to Linux.ting.com.

550
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,600
You can find a device for a great value if you just want to get the same like I did.

551
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,960
I just you know, when I got the iPad ages ago, I was like, well, I want GPS.

552
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,200
I don't really care about the cellular, but I do want GPS.

553
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Exactly.

554
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
And so I thought, well, maybe.

555
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
All right, fine.

556
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
I'll do it.

557
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,040
And then for years, since I've just sat there, never with a SIM card in it.

558
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,320
And then just a week ago, I'm like, you know what?

559
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,320
I got a reason.

560
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
It's six bucks a month.

561
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
Why not?

562
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
Now you're glad you got it.

563
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
I really am.

564
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
Yeah, it's so awesome.

565
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,400
You can just anything like that for your main phone to just a little device you want to

566
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,880
add data to Linux.ting.com.

567
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,600
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged Program.

568
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Linux.ting.com.

569
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,640
I don't really I don't really have much to say about this next story other than what

570
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,440
does kind of jump out at me is the register is like like bipolar about its coverage when

571
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
it comes to Linus.

572
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,060
It's either Linus is the devil bringing rage to the Internet and scaring people away from

573
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:35,920
open source development because of his toad, or he's Santa Claus and he's saving Christmas.

574
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,720
It's literally the range for the register.

575
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,480
So this headline reads, Linus Torvalds releases the biggest ever Linux 4.9 and then saves

576
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,480
Christmas.

577
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,360
Now, wasn't it just a few headlines ago where Linus was the worst human being on the Internet?

578
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
Just what Christmas needed.

579
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,360
Yeah.

580
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,980
So Linus writes, I'm pretty sure this is the biggest release we've ever had.

581
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,640
It's definitely at least the biggest in the number of commits.

582
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,080
This was written on the kernel mailing list.

583
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,480
Other notable additions this time around include support for the Raspberry Pi Zero.

584
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,480
Hey.

585
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,360
Oh, plus another few 28 arm devices.

586
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,800
There's also things in there that you might be interested in, like the AMD GPU support

587
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,080
to enable the use of virtual displays from GPUs.

588
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,520
Hey, oh, William, we might be we might be in your you're hearing your activation key

589
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
from time to time.

590
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,520
I think that might have been you.

591
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,400
Anyways, here's the thing, Wes.

592
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,600
You got to hustle in because Torvalds has also confirmed a small change the development

593
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,640
process starting with Linux 4.10 in the form of a shorter than usual merge window.

594
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
Get ready, Wes.

595
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,780
These kernel patches got to get in.

596
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,120
The usual two week merge window will close on December 25th, which might look familiar

597
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,360
as Linus says, because it is Christmas Day.

598
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,280
And so if you're originally from Finland like he is, it's the day you relax.

599
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,960
Well, so might as well just might as well finish up that.

600
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
Yeah, I guess.

601
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
Right.

602
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,360
So because the real part, he says, happens on Christmas Eve.

603
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,440
I will certainly stop pulling on the 23rd at the latest.

604
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,280
So you better hurry up if you want to get your patches in.

605
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,960
Hurry up, Wes, because Christmas, Christmas is going to affect the merge window.

606
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,120
And this is the story I'm actually I mean, yeah, a new kernel.

607
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,460
This is the story I'm more excited about because it it really actually represents a four year

608
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,800
completion of a goal for crossover.

609
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,160
And it's a major milestone for wine.

610
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,720
Crossover has launched version 16.

611
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,800
Crossover is the code weavers product that gives you a graphical front end to set up

612
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,460
Windows applications with guides and scripts and downloaders.

613
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,160
It's a great product and it uses bottles to isolate them so you don't break your different

614
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,080
wine environments for different apps.

615
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,860
And they have finally I know you might think this is funny, but they finally after four

616
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:36,560
years nailed Office 2013 support, or at least damn close.

617
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:42,480
And I suppose if I was going to want to run Office on Linux, 2013, that would be fine.

618
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,720
That was the last good one.

619
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
So that's fine.

620
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,280
And the other big note here is it's shipping wine 2.0, which is I don't think technically

621
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,280
out.

622
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,280
Yeah.

623
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,280
Right.

624
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,360
I thought wine 2.0 was still in development, but they're shipping wine.

625
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,000
They're using a wine 2.0 code base.

626
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,400
Now this makes sense because a lot of what code weavers does goes upstream to the wine

627
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
project.

628
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,400
So they would be very likely maybe running on stuff that hasn't been accepted upstream

629
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
yet.

630
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,640
They say they're also going to be focusing on Android support and DirectX 11.

631
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
Yeah.

632
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,680
Android support and DirectX 11 in 2017.

633
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:21,040
It's pretty cool to see this development all going upstream and getting better.

634
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,120
And thankfully I don't have occasion to use wine that much in my day-to-day life.

635
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,840
But if you have office needs support for that kind of stuff, interop, this goes a long way.

636
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,760
Where does Crossover go once most of what we need to do is online?

637
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,760
If I can now run QuickBooks online, I don't really need Crossover as much to use QuickBooks

638
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
on the desktop.

639
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:45,880
And if I can now run Office in the web and Office on Google stuff, do I really need to

640
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,960
go bend over backwards to run Office 2013?

641
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,960
Absolutely in the business.

642
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,960
That's still got to be a use case.

643
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,960
But it feels like that's going to be...

644
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,960
It's diminishing, right?

645
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,920
So that must be why they're switching to Android, right?

646
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,800
I remember when they announced a Mac version, I was like, well, shit, there goes the Linux

647
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
version.

648
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
It's going to go down.

649
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
But really they've done a great job.

650
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,520
They've kept it really feature complete on both sides.

651
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,520
Yeah, totally.

652
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,600
So if anybody could do it, it's probably them.

653
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,400
But it does seem interesting that they're moving to Android.

654
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,640
And does that mean Windows applications on Android?

655
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
On Android?

656
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,600
Because I can't imagine that would be pleasant.

657
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,200
What Android device are they thinking of where that's a thing you need?

658
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,960
A tablet?

659
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,080
A laptop?

660
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
Is it just for...

661
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,800
Actually, I'll speculate a little bit here.

662
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,320
I bet you the way they do this is with a strict focus on certain games.

663
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,480
So they're going to bring a couple of Windows favorites to Android, and it'll be powered

664
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
by crossover, I bet.

665
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,780
It might even just be a completely wrapped solution.

666
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:50,000
So they'll have the individual app in the Play Store, and it's using a crossover backend

667
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
to run.

668
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Huh?

669
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
How about that?

670
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
That would be interesting.

671
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I think that was Chris's first 2017 prediction.

672
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Yeah.

673
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Wow.

674
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I think I just did that.

675
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You heard it here first, the Linux unplugged.

676
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,720
Yeah, I just wasted a good one for the predictions episode.

677
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:07,320
And then this one would be interesting for those of you running Core OS up on Digital

678
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
Ocean or on your own switch.

679
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,360
We don't know anyone who does that.

680
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,980
No, no, no.

681
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,980
This is huge, though.

682
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:19,280
Core OS developer Alex has announced that they're switching the name to Container Linux.

683
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,760
No more Core OS.

684
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,560
Container Linux by Core OS.

685
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,760
Yeah, they're doing a little Plasma desktop by KDE on us here.

686
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,040
The decision to rename the OS was made earlier during the Tectonic Summit 2016 event presented

687
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:37,760
by Core OS, and they also unveiled the next-gen Core OS Tectonic Enterprise Kubernetes solution

688
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,540
for deploying and managing containers at scale.

689
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,540
Does that mean anything to you?

690
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,720
I mean, if you have a lot of containers, you got to have something that tells them what

691
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
to do.

692
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
Yeah.

693
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,920
And they should be running on Container Linux.

694
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,920
It's hard to say still.

695
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,920
I'm not used to it.

696
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,920
All right.

697
00:31:53,920 --> 00:32:00,480
I'm not huge on the name, but it definitely, it's like calling it what it does.

698
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,000
And so, hey, what's the best Linux to run containers on?

699
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,520
I hear containers are the big thing.

700
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,520
Well, there's Container Linux.

701
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,520
Container Linux, of course.

702
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Just use it.

703
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:13,560
Sounds like they're trying to copy Noah's nick, that it's like Kernel Linux, Container

704
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
Linux.

705
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Yeah, maybe.

706
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
Maybe.

707
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,240
I wonder how this is going to affect people that are running Core OS now, because Core

708
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,980
OS kind of gets these rolling updates.

709
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,960
Will you just be one day running Container Linux and no longer Core OS?

710
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,520
Like all the branding will just get refreshed?

711
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,400
Let's see OS release just changes.

712
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,000
I mean, it's just branding.

713
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Yeah.

714
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Yeah.

715
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Yeah.

716
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I know.

717
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I agree.

718
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
It's an interesting change.

719
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It's an obvious, like, try to play for...

720
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,960
I feel like there's been a lot of renames, rebrandings recently.

721
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,520
TrueOS from PCBSTD.

722
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
Yeah.

723
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520
Yeah.

724
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,720
2016 has been rough for a lot of people, man.

725
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,600
It's been a rough year for a lot of people.

726
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,560
There's nobody in the lug there that's running Core OS, right?

727
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,960
Nobody, I would imagine.

728
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,960
I've played with it.

729
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,160
I've checked it out.

730
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:01,960
They've got some of the actually most interesting things about Container Linux is the technology

731
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:07,040
they've open sourced to make Container Linux possible, etcd and some of their other –

732
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
Yes, definitely.

733
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
Yeah.

734
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
That's where some of the cool stuff is.

735
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,400
They've also done some interesting work in trying to use like Secure Boot or TPMs

736
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,400
to help.

737
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,280
So you are deploying in your own data center that you can verify that only your software

738
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,880
is running on your hardware, which I think that's interesting.

739
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,880
Mm-hmm.

740
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,880
Mm-hmm.

741
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
EvolvOS to Solus.

742
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
But we don't mention that one.

743
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
No, we don't.

744
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,880
We don't mention EvolvOS.

745
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
It's a pretty good name, though.

746
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,880
Although, you know what?

747
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,360
I think Solus is growing on me more.

748
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
Yeah, me too.

749
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,480
I actually think I like Solus better.

750
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,120
So I think long term, I think it was a better play, Ike.

751
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,360
You know, speaking of Solus, we should talk about that.

752
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,360
We actually –

753
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,360
That's on the docket.

754
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,120
That is really what I'm looking forward to the most today because there is some ridiculous

755
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,720
shenanigans going down, and I'm not going to have it.

756
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,080
I'm not going to have this turn into some sort of community that's productive and with

757
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,680
users benefiting.

758
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,680
That's not good for the show.

759
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,000
That's what we have to think about here.

760
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,560
So let's take a moment before we go into that next subject.

761
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,540
I was just mentioning DigitalOcean, DigitalOcean.com.

762
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,780
Go there and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED after you create an account and then apply

763
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,480
this to your balance and you get a $10 credit.

764
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:11,240
CoreOS, which is now Container Linux, up on DigitalOcean.

765
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,080
This was one of the first times I really got insight, too, after DigitalOcean became a

766
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,920
sponsor and how they work upstream with a project, and I was like really impressed by

767
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,920
that.

768
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,400
Obviously, other things that really get me about DigitalOcean is how fast you can spin

769
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,920
up a Linux server on demand when you want one, how great their interface is to manage

770
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,240
all of this, and the solidness in which the platform has performed for me now that I've

771
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
been using it for years.

772
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,760
Like, that's another thing about it that I don't really mention in these reads, but

773
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,440
it's – if you're new to it, you want to – well, how reliable is it?

774
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,440
But they're not a newcomer.

775
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,440
They've been doing this a while now.

776
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,520
They've gotten damn good at it.

777
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,800
They were one of the first, and it really has paid off for them.

778
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,800
They were one of the first early-ons to invest all SSDs back when – I mean, this is years

779
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,520
ago now when SSDs were extremely expensive, especially in the enterprise, and they still

780
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,520
are in the enterprise.

781
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,840
But DigitalOcean realized that this is a key part to the performance value.

782
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,600
And so that's – when I say you can get a droplet for $5 a month, that's all SSD-backed.

783
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,960
All of them have 40 gigabit E connection to the hypervisor.

784
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,400
They've got fast processors, and you can also price a rig for three cents an hour,

785
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,760
which is two gigs of RAM and multiple cores, and it's just phenomenal how fast it all

786
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,640
is when you combine that disk I.O. with that network connection, that great interface,

787
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:23,160
and the API, which allows you to do so many things from your phone or the command line

788
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,520
that just make you more productive.

789
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,040
I always joke about this, but, like, there's things I can do.

790
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:33,640
I just go to a tab and drop down a Guake terminal, and I can issue commands that start and stop

791
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,840
servers that make streams connect all over the place.

792
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,840
I don't – and I can do that from any of my machines that I have Guake on and an IRC

793
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,840
client.

794
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,840
And it's so awesome.

795
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
Just right at your fingertips.

796
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,760
It's so much faster than going to a web page and logging in.

797
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,960
It's just – I hit the tilde button, and I issue a command.

798
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,240
And if you're in the chat room before a show, you see me issue those commands.

799
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,600
Those are spinning up DigitalOcean droplets on the back end, and then they're kicking

800
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:02,160
off scripts connecting to the endpoints that we're streaming to using their API.

801
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,360
And I use it multiple times a day.

802
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,520
It's so brilliant.

803
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,320
And then you combine that with the speed, the reliability, the great price, and all

804
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,920
of the fantastic documentation, and the fact that they stay up to date with the latest

805
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,000
and greatest Linux distributions and FreeBSD.

806
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,880
And then they have block storage on top of it all, up to 16 terabytes of SSD back storage,

807
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
which is nuts.

808
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:27,560
And if you just want to even just mess around at all with LVM or ZFS or any kind of disk

809
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
orchestration system –

810
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,960
Go make yourself a nice big array, play with it for a couple hours.

811
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,960
Yeah, man.

812
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,600
I was watching a demo of a system that had – essentially, to the system, it appeared

813
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,840
to be 30 different block devices.

814
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:44,880
And that's – for pennies on the hour, that's a system that you couldn't replicate even

815
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,320
at some of the most high-end IT shops.

816
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,320
I can't pop one of those right now.

817
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,320
No.

818
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,840
No, it's been so awesome to be able to go there and then play with the latest and greatest

819
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
software too.

820
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,420
And if you're a total beginner, you can deploy an entire application stack with Linux installed

821
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,000
and all the stuff you want.

822
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,560
And if you're messing around with containers, there's really no better option out there.

823
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,840
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

824
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:08,360
It's one word, you apply it to your account, you get a $10 credit, DigitalOcean.com.

825
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,040
And thanks, DigitalOcean, for sponsoring the unplugged shenanigans.

826
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,600
So I saw this Google Plus post from this Wimpy character – oh, I'm sorry, I think he goes

827
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,160
by Martin on Google Plus.

828
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:23,360
He says, I'm extremely pleased that Solace and Ubuntu Mate are deepening the collaboration,

829
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,920
so much so that I said these words in a recent This Week in Solace post.

830
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,720
Ubuntu Mate have been working to – oh, I should have Wimpy read this in his voice.

831
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,200
That's – why am I reading this?

832
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,000
Wimpy, do you have this post handy enough that you could read it for us in your own

833
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Wimpy brand?

834
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,480
I could do it in a few seconds.

835
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,400
Yeah, that'd be good, because I could – why should I, if I could have it in your own voice?

836
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,640
This is a great – and really, it's a great thing that's happening here.

837
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,680
I've been teasing the whole episode.

838
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,920
But that's because we're excited.

839
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,200
I am very excited about this.

840
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,080
And I think that the choice is right on both accounts.

841
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:58,240
I will take this moment to pull up This Week in Solace that Wimpy is referencing, so we

842
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,320
can show the pretty images on the stream.

843
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
This is great.

844
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,320
Okay.

845
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,320
All right.

846
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,840
So the words that I said in This Week in Solace to Josh Strobel were, Ubuntu Mate have been

847
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,100
looking to replace the Mate menu, which was forked from Mint menu for some time.

848
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,240
It's clear the Brisk menu, despite being in the very early stages of development, is

849
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,920
the project that can achieve that, given the quality of work coming out of the Solace project.

850
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,920
Wow.

851
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,480
It's very complimentary towards Solace, and interesting that this is a departure from

852
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,800
a menu that has its heritage in Linux Mint, something that's – when I saw it in Ubuntu

853
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,080
Mate, I actually was glad to see it.

854
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,240
Because I like that menu a lot.

855
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,720
It's just – it does start – it is starting to feel old and slow.

856
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,000
But I don't understand what's happening here.

857
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It's always been slow.

858
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,480
I don't – I thought –

859
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,940
It's comfortable.

860
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:55,480
Solace seems like cats and dogs to me, to a certain degree, because Solace is – I

861
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
don't know.

862
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,480
This feels like an odd couple pairing to me, for some reason.

863
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,480
I think it's fantastic.

864
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,400
You know, Ubuntu Mate had come from kind of a – what was before, what we thought we

865
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,640
could continue with, Solace kind of broke out on their own and does things their own

866
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,640
way, their own style.

867
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,920
It's kind of – that's kind of the schtick.

868
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,040
Shall I give you the backstory here?

869
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,720
And also, let's just touch on this.

870
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,480
Although I posted these things about Solace, this isn't the only collaboration that's

871
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,040
happening with Ubuntu Mate at the moment.

872
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:30,000
We've got Don Foray, who's just completed doing some icon work for us, as well, which

873
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
–

874
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,840
Not to interrupt, but Daniel is – Daniel is from Elementary OS.

875
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,400
And Daniel did work on – it's like the Humanity icon theme originally.

876
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
Right.

877
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
That's his history.

878
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,440
And so now he's working with the Mate project, just for people that don't know who Daniel

879
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,440
is.

880
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,440
Go ahead.

881
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,960
So I'll explain a bit of the backstory with Solace first.

882
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,080
So behind the scenes, what people don't see is that myself and Aiki are chatting fairly

883
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:00,520
frequently about stuff, and we have collaborated on things in the past.

884
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:06,360
What was started here by Aiki, we could have silently just let happen in the usual way

885
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,400
that we get on with stuff.

886
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,220
But recently, there's been an uptick of reporting in the online press about the divisions

887
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:21,840
within the Linux community and projects working in silos on separate stuff and not collaborating.

888
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,280
And that isn't actually how things work at all.

889
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:31,680
So I decided to use some of these collaborations that are happening recently to sort of counter

890
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,480
what we've been seeing in the press recently.

891
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
Nice.

892
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,880
So to point to that, when Aiki announced that he was going to make a Mate spin of Solace,

893
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:48,440
I contacted Aiki and said, here's all of the things I did in Ubuntu Mate to change the

894
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,440
branding.

895
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,440
And this is probably stuff that you'll want to do.

896
00:40:52,440 --> 00:41:00,080
And I also watched his hackathon six hour video fest thing to see him actually do that

897
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:05,680
initial enablement of Mate and send him some feedback based on what I'd seen.

898
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,440
And I've also had some conversations with Josh as well around that.

899
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,440
And Aiki and I have also had some conversations about, so Aiki is also submitting some pull

900
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,880
requests to the Mate desktop to make notifications interactive.

901
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,080
That was a recent thing that Aiki did and nobody knows about that because we didn't

902
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,080
publicize it.

903
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,080
That's huge.

904
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,460
And, you know, Aiki and I've talked about some other areas where Aiki could contribute

905
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:36,520
to the Mate desktop where he has specific skills and know how that the Mate team lack.

906
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:46,560
And what I want to do is use the funding that the Ubuntu Mate project is generating to fund

907
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,560
these people in the community that are capable of doing good work that benefits Mate or Ubuntu

908
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,560
Mate.

909
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,480
So if you want good quality code and a modern contemporary menu that's well implemented,

910
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,960
you go to the guy that writes highly optimized code that understands the traditional desktop

911
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,960
metaphor.

912
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,680
That's Aiki at Solus.

913
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,360
And if you want artwork, the standout project in the open source community for aesthetics

914
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,880
and design is elementary.

915
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,900
So that's who you go and talk to.

916
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:23,480
So Ubuntu Mate is funding both those initiatives through our crowdfunding to improve Mate and

917
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,240
Ubuntu Mate, but also ensure that some money goes to those projects as well.

918
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,440
So they've got some money coming in to improve their projects and distributions as well.

919
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,320
So that's the whole thing.

920
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,760
So I think Aiki, that's me doing the complicated talky talky talky talky bit.

921
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
Yeah.

922
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,920
Now Aiki, which I love everything that Wimpy just said, but Aiki, don't you know better

923
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,920
to compete?

924
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,320
You're supposed to keep all of your best stuff for yourself and fork everything and relame

925
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,360
it and keep it and just bloat the project with all of these own little independent islands

926
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,800
of applications that you maintain.

927
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,520
Don't you understand how this works?

928
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,520
No.

929
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:05,120
Well, I mean, even me, I don't fork things.

930
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:09,320
Solus itself is independent and there's an immense value in competition.

931
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,240
So when we brought out the Solus Mate edition, there was a few things that we had to look

932
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,240
at.

933
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,440
There is what I like to think of the reference implementation of Mate, which is oddly ironic.

934
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,920
Wimpy and myself were talking about this earlier.

935
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:28,800
Ubuntu Mate does diverge from stock Mate quite a bit, but it's the Mate when you think about

936
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,800
it.

937
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,480
And we decided to compete with them because then you set the bar at a certain level.

938
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,080
Even if you're not there at the time, that's what you're aiming for.

939
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,000
And in doing so, you start to expose areas of weakness.

940
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,520
And for me, immediately, that was the menu.

941
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:50,080
So we were going to be putting out a new release of Solus, a new snapshot, but the menu, I

942
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,620
just couldn't get over my issues with it.

943
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:59,160
So I then investigated the menu fork, which is, I believe, Wimpy did that himself.

944
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:06,100
It basically took the existing menu and stripped out all the silliness, basically the hooks

945
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,080
into package management and things like that.

946
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:15,000
And even with all that done, it runs dog slow.

947
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,440
I cannot bring myself to do it because I know what that code looks like.

948
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,000
I've seen that over a few years.

949
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,760
So I just got to a point where it's like, well, you know, I've written menus before.

950
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,920
This can't be too difficult.

951
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,920
So I started writing it up.

952
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:36,240
And then, yeah, we agreed that the best thing to do is have that as something that's agnostic

953
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,360
because that's something Solus is really trying to focus on lately.

954
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,780
Make sure our software is agnostic, that everyone benefits from it.

955
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:48,320
And in the way that we're doing this, so Avanti Mate through Wimpy is funding the development

956
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,800
of Brisk.

957
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:53,060
And in turn, that money would then be able to fund projects that Solus does or Solus

958
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,720
gets invested in.

959
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,780
So you kind of have this, to use a real corporate term here, you have like a virtuous cycle

960
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,780
of growth.

961
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,000
Some synergy is happening there.

962
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Nice one, Aiki.

963
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Virtuous synergy.

964
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Aiki, the other question I have to ask you is, in 2016, we do docs now.

965
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Everything's docs.

966
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,080
This looks like a menu.

967
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,480
Can you explain yourself?

968
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,900
That's definitely a menu.

969
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:24,520
So for the Mate desktop, you want something that's basically a little bit traditional.

970
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,280
You want something that's nice, but by the same token, you don't want a full screen launcher.

971
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,620
You don't want docs.

972
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,100
You don't want dashes.

973
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,800
You want to hit your Windows key, sorry, Super key, and have a menu to come up, and then

974
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,800
you can just type.

975
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,640
Or if you want to filter by category, you can do that.

976
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:45,460
But you also want it to be fast because when I was testing the menu, when you're searching,

977
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,320
there's a visible lag while it filters the results.

978
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,320
It's not acceptable.

979
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,320
Not in 2016.

980
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,140
Oh, I am excited about this.

981
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,720
This is going to be my favorite launcher.

982
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,720
I can tell.

983
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,400
I've got an i7 Nokia and it was lagging.

984
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,400
Not acceptable.

985
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,400
How?

986
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,400
How?

987
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,400
There's 16 gigs of RAM.

988
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,700
And when Aiki and I were discussing this behind the scenes, you know, I explained I'd put as

989
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:13,200
much effort into the Mate menu as I was prepared to invest because as Aiki says, it's spaghetti

990
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:20,880
code and frankly, the hotspot in the loop that causes all of the lag in the Mint menu,

991
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,560
I can't decipher what the heck is going on there.

992
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,840
It's just impenetrable.

993
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,760
So I was never going to touch that.

994
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,800
And I've made a number of improvements to fix the way that it works and some integration.

995
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,480
And there's some bugs with it in the way that it hooks into comps and things.

996
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,680
And I simply can't fix that because of the wrong way things have been implemented there.

997
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:47,320
So when I saw this, we've investigated other menus and launchers along the way, but when

998
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:51,680
I saw this, I thought, I know this is going to be done right and we really need it.

999
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,480
That's the thing that people keep.

1000
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:59,040
So along Ubuntu Mate's journey, there has been things you can identify as this is the

1001
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,120
pain point for people.

1002
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,360
And the pain point right now is people want a better advanced menu.

1003
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,600
And here it is.

1004
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,480
So Aiki's mentioned that we're offering some funding for this.

1005
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:15,840
And also my other end of the sort of the social contract on this is that I will package Brisk

1006
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:21,480
for Debian and Ubuntu and see that it gets into both the official archives for those.

1007
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:27,960
And replace the Mate menu with Brisk menu as soon as Brisk menu covers all of the core

1008
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,860
functionality of Mate menu.

1009
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,960
So I really will be using Brisk soon then.

1010
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,680
I really think this, the dock thing needs to go.

1011
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:44,200
I have a few docks, but I do it more like the Unity launcher, a persistent sidebar.

1012
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,040
Because I don't like this, am I going to have the screen space?

1013
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,400
And I don't like this constant, like I need to resize my window to make everything show

1014
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,880
up on the screen when I can just have a menu that I click and it drops down and it's just

1015
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,240
not even an issue for me.

1016
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,160
So Aiki, if I'm a Solace user, how does this work?

1017
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,600
Is this something that you'll ship eventually in a certain point release?

1018
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,720
Is this something that just rolls in?

1019
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,800
Is it something that I could get my hands on soon or do I have to wait a while?

1020
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,440
What do I expect as a Solace user for developments like this?

1021
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,640
So I basically put in about just under 24 hours into this.

1022
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,000
It started over the weekend and then back to work and whatnot.

1023
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,760
But most of the core of it's actually done in terms of having the category system and

1024
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:29,920
having the filtering and having it filter results by relevancy.

1025
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,000
Because that was one of the problems we had in the budget menu where we put a hack in

1026
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,880
to sort things by most used, but now it'll actually sort them by relevancy to your term.

1027
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,520
So in terms of pace, I mean, that's going to be out real soon.

1028
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,560
We'll go through a number of releases.

1029
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:52,240
Our first validation one, we'll go into the next Solace MATE ISO, and then we'll continue

1030
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,120
working with Martin just to make sure that these are the things that we want in there.

1031
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,280
Things are working as expected.

1032
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,000
So there are going to be a number of releases now that come out, and that's on GitHub like

1033
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,520
you'd expect it to be.

1034
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:09,000
And check in with Martin is going to be real simple because I just trust Aiki's judgment.

1035
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
So what is it written in?

1036
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
C.

1037
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:19,680
Okay, so I was just, I was hoping to have a chance for us all to freak out when you

1038
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,680
said Python.

1039
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,280
I thought we were all going to have like a group like, oh, that's what we're replacing.

1040
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,280
Yeah, I know.

1041
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,280
That's what we're replacing.

1042
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,280
I know.

1043
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,800
I just, that's why I was, I thought if they're on the off chance, that would be a good gasping

1044
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,800
moment.

1045
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,800
But no, that makes sense.

1046
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,800
Well, that is super cool.

1047
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,360
There are other benefits to this menu as well.

1048
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,880
So we've had a couple of people that freaked out on Google plus basically saying when you

1049
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,560
first announced the Solus Mate edition, I knew this would detract resources and now

1050
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,560
you're not.

1051
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,320
Whoa, whoa, whoa, calm down a second.

1052
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:52,360
In terms of doing this menu, it's already benefited Budgie, which is going to sound

1053
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:57,160
really, really strange because it's not for Budgie, but it's already benefited and fixed

1054
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,600
two bugs already because I'm doing a clean room implementation without none of the old

1055
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,600
rust code.

1056
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:07,360
And you know, things are actually being done if you like by the book and I'm not using

1057
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:10,760
things that shouldn't be used like Valor and Python anyway.

1058
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,400
So one of the bugs it's already managed to fix in Budgie was the icon task list.

1059
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,720
It wasn't tracking the startup notifications of applications properly and canceling that

1060
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,800
notification.

1061
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,280
So in Budgie you'd have this timeout of 30 seconds with a spinny wheel of douchiness

1062
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,300
as I've come to call it and it just wouldn't go away.

1063
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:33,880
So it's like it's managed to fix that and now the run dialogue can properly track when

1064
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,200
the application is fully launched and encloses itself.

1065
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,760
And that's come from doing brisk menu.

1066
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:44,440
So you know, like there's all these little things, it is kind of like throwing a stone

1067
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,440
in a pond.

1068
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,280
You don't quite know where it's going to land and there's all these ripples coming out.

1069
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,980
You don't really know what they're going to affect, but it's already having positive effects

1070
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:56,160
and it's only like essentially a day old in terms of code.

1071
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:00,360
It sounds like things are proceeding very quickly.

1072
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:05,980
I think those kinds of projects too are the perfect thing for getting the more people

1073
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,980
talking about the distribution.

1074
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:11,320
So even if it didn't actually end up fixing a single bug on the main desktop, it still

1075
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,960
feels like it's good publicity for the project.

1076
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,960
There is that too.

1077
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:24,240
It's good to raise the profile of what are the emerging distributions, maybe the new

1078
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:31,560
guard of distributions for the next era of desktop Linux.

1079
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,260
Also it's important to point out you've talked about competition.

1080
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:42,600
Ikey and I do compete with one another, and we also both compete with elementary desktop,

1081
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:48,360
but all three distributions are talking to one another and collaborating with one another.

1082
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:54,360
And the competition is healthy because it drives us forward and where we can share things

1083
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:58,960
and where somebody solved a problem and we can all benefit from that, then we're moving

1084
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,680
together and the landscape is improving for everybody.

1085
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:10,300
And frankly, I don't really care if Ubuntu MATE is the dominant operating system because

1086
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,080
it simply won't be.

1087
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:16,760
But what I do care about is making sure that the MATE desktop remains relevant and has

1088
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,920
a future and it's initiatives like this that will help ensure that.

1089
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:25,720
And through other funding initiatives will also help ensure that we stay current with

1090
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,800
other technologies that are coming along as well.

1091
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,280
That's a great point.

1092
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,760
Yeah, they're just making sure that people want to keep using the desktop and a menu

1093
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,760
like this.

1094
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,040
If you're listening, it's a really just nice straightforward drop down menu that you're

1095
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,640
going to just recognize immediately.

1096
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,040
In response to the sort of commands you'd expect.

1097
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,040
So that's the brisk menu.

1098
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,800
We'll have a link in the show notes if you want to check it out.

1099
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:51,180
And to the point of publicity for the project, just before we move on, literally every time

1100
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:55,800
we have a conversation like this, I'm like, I've got to get this on a machine somewhere.

1101
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,040
It's time to try it out.

1102
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,040
Yeah.

1103
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,040
Yeah.

1104
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:04,280
And I am just I am so married to the AUR for production purposes, because I sit down here

1105
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,280
and I install three apps.

1106
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,520
I'm like, all right, this is I try them on like this is the one I'm going to try.

1107
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,240
This is the one I'm going to talk about today on on the next action show.

1108
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,800
And just being able to bust it out like that super quick is key because sometimes I'm already

1109
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:20,600
sitting down on the microphone just playing around on the live stream and that is a use.

1110
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:26,040
Are you suggesting you need a dedicated machine on which you can test the two solos solos

1111
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,040
distribution?

1112
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,040
Yeah, well, that would be true.

1113
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,040
I think he is saying that.

1114
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:33,720
Well, I had a I actually thought it'd be a good job for the Apollo, but I had something

1115
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:34,720
happen.

1116
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,120
Well, we'll talk at the end of the show.

1117
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,120
We'll make that happen.

1118
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:46,880
So Chris, AUR, while it was something that was distinctly not possible in the past, and

1119
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,600
personally, myself, I don't want to say that for mainstream users of solos, because we

1120
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:58,040
provide binary repos, you can now provide your own binary repos and solos as well with

1121
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,640
the new sol build tool.

1122
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:04,760
You can run it on any Linux distribution that has overlay fs in the kernel.

1123
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,900
And you can build solos packages from that.

1124
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:11,960
You can also create your own solos repos using that tool from any Linux distribution.

1125
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,960
Nice.

1126
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,080
Okay, that seems like a big deal.

1127
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:21,720
I was looking at the this week in solos number 40, and I saw you or Josh whoever wrote this,

1128
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:27,120
Josh, I saw a mention in here about so build with a great gift that got my attention, but

1129
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,840
it went over my head as to what it is.

1130
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:31,000
You're telling me, what are you telling me exactly?

1131
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
What are you?

1132
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,080
What knowledge bomb are you dropping on me?

1133
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,160
Because all of a sudden, I just got really excited.

1134
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:41,020
Okay, so our old build system was Python, you know, we all make mistakes.

1135
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:45,520
There is an initiative in solos to move away from Python because we basically want compiler

1136
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,480
safety in all core tooling, which I think is a fair assertion to have.

1137
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,960
And Python has no performance at all.

1138
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,880
So we've rewritten in Go, Go is now the tooling language we use in solos.

1139
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,920
It's hip, it's sexy, and it gets the job done.

1140
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,300
So we've rewritten the whole thing in Go and basically reverted a lot of the design mistakes

1141
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,720
from the past.

1142
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:09,560
So now it basically you have this base image, if you think about it, kind of like in the

1143
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,520
terms of Docker, except that this has done this longer than Docker has.

1144
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,040
If you think about it, you've got a base image and each image is either unstable or the main

1145
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,040
repo.

1146
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,000
That insight has got a very minimal solar system, which is enough to have a compiler

1147
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,600
in there basically.

1148
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,240
So we store those in our server, you'd select the profile you want.

1149
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,160
When that downloads, it puts that as the bottom layer, and it gives you a temporary working

1150
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,800
root over the top of it.

1151
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,760
So the bottom layer is never touched, you have this temporary root, which is using overlay

1152
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,520
fs, then in a container, it's basically a container now.

1153
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,880
It used to be just a troop, but actually uses namespaces as well now.

1154
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:48,880
At the end of that environment, that will build the package entirely within the environment.

1155
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,680
Networking is disabled as well, so you can't exit the sandbox.

1156
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,600
You run as an unprivileged user inside the sandbox as well.

1157
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,800
And once the build is done, it'll admit the packages into your current directory and re-own

1158
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,240
them to your user.

1159
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,920
So if you invoked it as pseudo, it'll take the original pseudo user and make them owned

1160
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:06,920
as yours.

1161
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,040
Oh, that's a nice touch.

1162
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,480
If you run the index command, all of the packages you have in the current directory, it'll emit

1163
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,160
an EO package index file, which is a repository.

1164
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,640
The next step of that is creating a tool called binman, which is binary manager.

1165
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:24,740
I'm not good at naming things, by the way, I'm not sure if you've noticed.

1166
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:29,640
It's also a tooling goal to replace our repo management script, which again, is Python.

1167
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:35,880
So what kind of workload are they looking at, say, if I wanted to install, I don't know,

1168
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,160
is Telegram in the main binary repository?

1169
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,160
Yeah.

1170
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,160
Okay.

1171
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,920
So if I put an application like Telegram or something like that, what would be the, for

1172
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,720
the end user, what kind of process would that be for me to do that?

1173
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,720
Yeah.

1174
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,320
I mean, to build something like that, our package files are called package.yml.

1175
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,360
They're YAML syntax.

1176
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:58,200
So the very basic things our package have, you have a name, a source, a version, and

1177
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,760
a release.

1178
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,040
So you're describing the meta information of the package, and the source is where it

1179
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,040
comes from.

1180
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,080
So that can be a tarball, or it can be a Git source.

1181
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:11,520
We got built in Git supports into SoulBuild now, and it knows how to do tags, branches,

1182
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,440
commits, sub modules, and it'll handle all that stuff for you, and it'll create a systemwide

1183
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,040
cache that you can reuse for the builds to speed them up.

1184
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:23,420
And then you basically have three steps, which is set up, build, and install.

1185
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:26,680
Any one of those can be missing, it doesn't matter, but you're going to have to have some

1186
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,560
sort of process to say how to make a package.

1187
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:35,840
And they kind of map to the configure, make, install of a normal package you would do.

1188
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:40,320
But instead of that, they're basically bash scripts inside each one of those steps.

1189
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,400
So you wouldn't be lost.

1190
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:47,800
What we do is we spice it up by using macros, kind of like RPM, but better.

1191
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,240
So we'll have these predefined variables, like you'll have the configure, but with a

1192
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:56,360
percent sign, that will pass all of our configure tags to it, instead of just doing a dot slash

1193
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:57,360
configure.

1194
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,480
You can use some of the macros instead, and then boom, you have a package.

1195
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,760
You can make a package in like 11 or 12 lines.

1196
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:05,760
And then you can add...

1197
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:06,760
This is pretty neat.

1198
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:10,020
Well, what it does as well is it automatically split that package up for you.

1199
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:14,520
So if you package a library, and let's say it's got some header files, and it's got some

1200
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:19,400
package config files, you'll automatically gain a sub package called devel, and that

1201
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,320
will automatically depend on the main package as well.

1202
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:28,280
If you pass the emul32 option as yes, it will rebuild the 32-bit version of that library.

1203
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:32,320
So you get a 32-bit and a 32-bit devel sub package on top of that.

1204
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:35,760
So do you mean 32 and a 64?

1205
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,760
Yeah.

1206
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:43,520
So it has built-in emul32 support, so it'll build 64-bit and 32-bit at the same time.

1207
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,520
That is pretty nice.

1208
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:49,240
And not to diminish, that sounds like a really badass system, which has stuff in it that

1209
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:55,040
only stuff that's getting popular now, like overlay OS, or overlay FS, and YAML files.

1210
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:59,920
But honestly, my thought when you described all this is, it'd also just be nice if I could

1211
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,980
just install a snap package.

1212
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:02,980
That would be really nice too.

1213
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:10,500
You could, but I mean, snap packages require containment, and they require containment

1214
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,760
because of the fact you download them from the internet.

1215
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:17,680
Something is in our repositories, it is implicitly trusted, so it does not need container, right?

1216
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,920
So we ignore the container part of it because that's not relevant to our discussion.

1217
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,160
It's about the simplicity and distribution of a package.

1218
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,480
In terms of the simplicity and distribution of a package itself, why package and solbuild

1219
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,400
win every single day?

1220
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,520
Because we've got an advanced macro system, we've got advanced build system built into

1221
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,080
the different types.

1222
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,480
We support multi-lib out of the box and naturally.

1223
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,800
You can pass optimization straight away to the package by setting the optimize flag.

1224
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:49,840
We've got advanced macros, so in terms of the core of a package build, R1 is superior

1225
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,840
to snap.

1226
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:55,840
The only reason snap, quote, wins, end quote, anything, is because it's supposed to be distributed

1227
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:00,600
in an untrusted fashion and downloaded in an untrusted fashion, so it has the container

1228
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,600
aspect.

1229
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:06,440
If you take away the container aspect, R1 is superior because it's meant for native packaging.

1230
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,640
The advantage though, still remaining to snap might be developer adoption and availability

1231
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,360
of software for me as an end user.

1232
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:16,960
Sure, but the fact is, all of our software for building stuff, for doing the, what we're

1233
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:21,560
calling basically the solus build machinery, obviously it's all saying open source, but

1234
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,600
we're making it as agnostic as possible.

1235
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,280
The reason being is we're sharing that build machinery with anyone who wants to use it,

1236
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,360
and at some point we will also share that with partners.

1237
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,360
So while they might not want to share their source code with us for us to build their

1238
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:38,880
packages, if we share our build machinery with them and set them up, then they can build

1239
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,680
them themselves without us even having to interfere and provide native packages.

1240
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:47,640
And with the repository management tool we're now creating as well, that will automatically

1241
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:52,880
maintain the repo, create the delta updates they need, automatically trim old update,

1242
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:55,360
allow them to have unstable and stable branches.

1243
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,680
So with our tooling now going to them, they will be able to-

1244
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,640
Can I just interject very quickly?

1245
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,640
Yeah, sure.

1246
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:06,000
Ikey, some of what you've just described about snaps there, you're a little bit off, we'll

1247
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,640
talk after and I'll fill you in.

1248
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,720
That's fine, it's fine, it's absolutely fine.

1249
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:15,000
And also there's some new stuff happening in snaps and I'll give you the inside skinny

1250
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,440
because you might want to consider supporting some of the new snap features that are coming

1251
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,440
along and I'll talk to you about it after.

1252
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,240
Do you want to talk, you don't want to talk about it on the show?

1253
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:26,240
No.

1254
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,240
I want to know though.

1255
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,240
I'll just say this.

1256
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,240
Well stay tuned everyone.

1257
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:33,280
I'll say this regarding all the stuff that Ikey just described is, note it down now folks

1258
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:38,960
because look at it coming to a Linux distribution near you in probably about five years.

1259
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,840
Maybe that should be, we're just talking about this cross distro work.

1260
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,920
Maybe this is one of the next things that should lead over.

1261
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,720
Yeah, the VHS versus Betamax thing, isn't it?

1262
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:52,200
Mine is the superior technology in terms of building packages, right?

1263
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:57,360
In terms of distribution, obviously snap wins because they have a center, they have everything,

1264
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,240
but they're the common one that everyone wants and everyone is going to use.

1265
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,240
Well I'll give you this.

1266
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:05,240
It's a good track record of being ahead of where the puck is going and so there's probably

1267
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,240
a lot of stuff.

1268
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:07,920
We're not going to win on popularity at all there.

1269
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:09,240
Snap has already won.

1270
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,840
There is nowhere for us to win.

1271
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:17,840
So I'm not, as much as I was originally completely opposed to snap, there comes a point where

1272
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,680
you're going to have to say, this is what everyone's going to use.

1273
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,220
It's not going to be flat back.

1274
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:22,220
Snap has already beaten them.

1275
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:23,220
Snap is already the thing.

1276
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:26,120
I was going to give you a whole flat pack pitch, but all right, okay.

1277
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,080
I was going to ask if you had a minute to talk about flat back, but that's fine.

1278
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,080
What about AMP?

1279
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:35,680
Oh, and there's others that are just not coming to the old noggin right now.

1280
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:41,760
Anyway, I'll have a chat with Ike and give him some inside info later.

1281
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,760
I want to know.

1282
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:43,760
I like the inside info.

1283
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,760
That is always good.

1284
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:49,080
Yeah, I'll give you some good source Ike, no bother.

1285
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,960
Well if it's good, then I'll integrate it.

1286
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:52,960
Yeah, it sounds like it.

1287
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:53,960
It sounds like it.

1288
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:58,240
It's a position that is not impossible to be moved on, but it has to be worth it.

1289
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:02,840
Well, that's interesting, and now makes me pine for SolOS at the beginning of the show.

1290
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,040
Maybe next week we should both be running it.

1291
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:06,040
Ooh, ooh.

1292
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:09,920
All right, well, let's talk more about that on the post show.

1293
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,560
I want to just briefly, because we went on for a while because I was fascinated by that

1294
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,220
last topic, and I think rightfully so.

1295
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:19,480
So let's take a moment and let's thank Linux Academy for sponsoring these shenanigans.

1296
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,280
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged is where you go to keep it going.

1297
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,440
If you'd enjoy the conversations, the discussions, and want to hear more of us, please visit

1298
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,240
our sponsors, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, where you can sign up for a seven-day free

1299
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,520
trial of the Linux Academy platform, where you can learn a heck of a lot more.

1300
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:37,960
In fact, they've just launched two new courses, I just got an email about it today, it's super

1301
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:38,960
wicked.

1302
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,640
Check them out at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, it is the place to learn about Linux and all

1303
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:46,920
of the big infrastructure that runs on top of it, with hands-on, scenario-based labs,

1304
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:51,280
instructor mentoring, nice servers that spin up when you need them, that match the courseware

1305
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,920
you've chosen, like DistroWise, you SSH into it to get your work, they've got practice

1306
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:59,400
exams so you can prepare for certs, and they've got tiny little nuggets when you don't have

1307
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,480
a lot of time, you just want to go into a single topic, as well as schedule the availability

1308
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:08,000
picking depending on your busy, busy schedule, but probably the biggest feature is the instructor

1309
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,240
mentoring, full-time human instructors.

1310
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,300
Also, by the way, I'll mention this, check out on their blog, Linux Academy is hiring

1311
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:19,920
right now for instructor positions and for back-end positions, linuxacademy.com slash

1312
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,800

the Unplugged program, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and go check out the new courseware

1318
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,880
they launched today.

1319
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,280
Now what do you think?

1320
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,320
I was thinking about Ubuntu Core when I saw this, and I actually, it feels like a competitive

1321
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:56,400
response to Ubuntu Core.

1322
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,280
Google is launching Android of Things, and they plan to juice it up by integrating it

1323
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:07,480
in with all of their Google Play services, back-end cloud computing capabilities, Android

1324
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:12,160
Studio and the Android SDK for development, and they're going to also partner with Intel

1325
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:18,400
for the Edison, the NXP Pico, and the Raspberry guys for the Raspberry Pi 3 to get images,

1326
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:25,480
as well as Belkin and Lifix and Honeywell and Wink and TP-Link and First Alert.

1327
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:29,520
So they're going to work with Google on Weave and integrations with Google Assistant.

1328
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:35,400
So the whole picture here is Android on the IoT device itself, Weave for the communications

1329
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,880
protocol, and Google Assistant for the command and control.

1330
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,600
That's the world of Android Things.

1331
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,080
That's quite the ecosystem.

1332
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:44,080
Yeah.

1333
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:52,680
I wonder if this is Google, I know this sounds like it's maybe a little fanboy or something,

1334
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:57,320
but I honestly would not be surprised if they tried Brillo and went, shit, that didn't work,

1335
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:02,000
and these things that canonical this Ubuntu Core stuff over here, this looks like a good

1336
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
idea.

1337
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
We're starting to see people experiment with this.

1338
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,200
Well, how could we jack that up?

1339
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,200
How could we juice it up?

1340
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,760
How do we make it Google-ified?

1341
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,760
We've got the Play services.

1342
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,520
We've got the Google compute infrastructure that we could bring into the mix.

1343
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:18,000
We've got the Android SDK that's already massively deployed, and the Android Development Studio,

1344
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,680
which has a huge user base, and they come in with a lot of territory advantages.

1345
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,880
Yeah, a lot of things are going to be ported right over, already run there.

1346
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:30,360
Does it feel like a response to any particular product to you, or does it just feel like

1347
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:32,200
them still searching for a market?

1348
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:34,920
Yeah, it seems kind of like a natural evolution.

1349
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:35,920
They want to be here.

1350
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,160
There's like the article talks about, there's a whole Apple HomeKit kind of stuff, and so

1351
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:45,120
I could see where they'd want this, and I mean, Android's their platform, right?

1352
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:48,400
And if they have another chance to push the Play Store, to push their reliance on the

1353
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:54,120
Google-managed services, it seems like it's something they'd really be interested in doing.

1354
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:57,640
I don't know what they mean when they write this in here, but they say something to the

1355
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:01,680
effect of being able to also Google... What do they say?

1356
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,040
One intro... Here it is.

1357
01:07:03,040 --> 01:07:04,480
I don't even know what this means.

1358
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:05,920
This is from TechCrunch.

1359
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:10,220
One interesting twist here is that Google will soon enable all the necessary infrastructure

1360
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:15,840
to push Google's operating system updates and security fixes to these devices.

1361
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,400
What does that mean?

1362
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,520
Does that mean that they've introduced a product as it stands right now that doesn't support

1363
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,520
getting updates?

1364
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,520
Is that what that means?

1365
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,100
It kind of sounds like it, yeah.

1366
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,400
Like the updates is a new thing.

1367
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,120
And you know what would be really great?

1368
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,480
I mean, they're following the IoT tradition there, I think.

1369
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,800
Yeah, you know what would be super awesome?

1370
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:38,060
If Google come out and just be really clear and plain spoken about what the update policy

1371
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:42,680
is for these types of devices and what the agreements are in place with the OEMs to make

1372
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,440
sure that you can update these devices.

1373
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,460
Is this more like Android Wear, where Google has a little more control?

1374
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:51,820
Or is it like the Android we know and tolerate?

1375
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:55,500
Even in Wear, where they promised that they would be able to update it directly, LG held

1376
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:58,120
back my updates.

1377
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:03,040
And I have to wait for my Wahey watch or whatever it is to get updates from them.

1378
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,320
It's the same exact thing I have.

1379
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:11,080
And in fact, when I had the LG Watch R, they rolled out a new version of Android Wear that

1380
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,960
enabled Wi-Fi support.

1381
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,400
But not for my model.

1382
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,920
It had a Wi-Fi chip in there, but they didn't have the right driver in the image.

1383
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,880
So my model didn't get Wi-Fi support.

1384
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:23,280
So the same fragmentation issues in Android handsets are in Android Wear today.

1385
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,760
So I have very little faith.

1386
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:29,160
And what strikes me about this is one of the core principles of some of the competitors'

1387
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:32,760
offerings, like Ubuntu Core, is transactional secure updates.

1388
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:33,760
It's like part baked in.

1389
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:34,760
It's like the core.

1390
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,960
It's the foundation of the product.

1391
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:36,960
Am I wrong, Wimpy?

1392
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,040
But isn't it sort of a foundational aspect of Canonical's IoT approach?

1393
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,800
Sorry, you're going to have to repeat the question.

1394
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:46,000
I was distracted.

1395
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,600
Updates for Ubuntu Core, is that a transactional update?

1396
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,400
And wasn't that one of the core aspects of creating a software platform for devices like

1397
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,800
this is making sure you can reliably update them?

1398
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,800
Yes, that's correct.

1399
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:03,040
And it appears, as of right now, the Android of Things IoT platform doesn't actually support

1400
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,360
updating the software.

1401
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,600
And that they're going to roll that out soon, they say.

1402
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,280
And it seems to me that that's a fundamental design aspect of an operating system like

1403
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,280
this.

1404
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,440
Not like something you bolt on, but something you start with, especially in this space.

1405
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:21,280
So to build on your point, when we started this show, I was running Nextcloud 10.

1406
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:26,240
I've updated the snap to Nextcloud 11.

1407
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:30,960
And I found one of the Nextcloud apps that isn't compatible with Nextcloud 10.

1408
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:36,760
And I could choose to roll back now if I wanted to, because that one app doesn't work.

1409
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:41,880
And in addition to rolling back the app, I could also choose to roll back all the data

1410
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:44,560
associated with Nextcloud as well.

1411
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:49,840
So you've got an and or option there.

1412
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,280
This is going to be an interesting thing.

1413
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:53,760
I'm sure Google will have some amount of success with this.

1414
01:09:53,760 --> 01:09:56,480
And it's kind of interesting to see what their focus is.

1415
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:00,800
Obviously, at least here on this network, on this show, we talk a lot about IoT in terms

1416
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:04,920
of security, in terms of security failings, in terms of how it makes Linux look, how maybe

1417
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,480
it'll make Android look.

1418
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:09,640
So it'll be interesting to see what evolves as Google's focus here.

1419
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,800
Is it just ownership?

1420
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,240
Is it just getting their services going?

1421
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:18,680
Or is it doing things in a secure way that's better than what we have now?

1422
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:23,560
There could be a legitimate competitive functionality to having the Google Compute Cloud behind

1423
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,800
your IoT device.

1424
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,640
Obviously, these things are pretty low power, low CPU.

1425
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:31,760
So if you could do a huge computation job off on Google services and then send the result

1426
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,280
to the device, that could be really, really competitive.

1427
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,800
And something that would be harder for smaller players to match.

1428
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,400
Yeah, at least depending on the pricing.

1429
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:42,920
But Google seems to be willing to throw in some of this compute just as a, here you go,

1430
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,320
here's some free compute.

1431
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,440
Go ahead, have at it.

1432
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,080
Anyways, we'll just watch it.

1433
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:49,380
This is nothing today to really balk at.

1434
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:55,680
But I do feel like the Ubuntu core solution is getting more and more traction.

1435
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:56,680
You look at the next cloud box.

1436
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:59,560
But there's also a lot of other boxes out there that are running it behind the scenes.

1437
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:03,840
And you look at something like this and you think, Google must have noticed.

1438
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,840
They must have noticed.

1439
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,080
That was my thought when I saw it.

1440
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,860
And we'll have a link in the show notes if you want to read more about their efforts

1441
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:12,300
and maybe even how you could jump in.

1442
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,680
And I guess we say goodbye to Brillo, which still exists in some form.

1443
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,000
But it's not going to be the solution for us.

1444
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,160
This show will go on in another form next week.

1445
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,160
Join us, won't you?

1450
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,000
Also if you want to watch my biggest Linux switch disaster of all time.

1451
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Oh, it's embarrassing.

1452
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
It's bad.

1453
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,120
YouTube.com slash Chris Fisher.

1454
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,120
That's my personal channel.

1455
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:50,520
That was the last, the latest video I have posted over there, as well as about a dozen

1456
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:51,520
other ones.

1457
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,520
Which you can check out.

1458
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,640
You can follow me on Twitter, at Chris Elias.

1459
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,640
You're at Westpain, aren't you?

1460
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:56,640
That's a great Twitter handle.

1461
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:57,640
Oh, thank you, sir.

1462
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:58,640
That's nice.

1463
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,120
You really nabbed a good one.

1464
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:04,760
At Jupiter signal for the network and we'll see you right back here next week.

1465
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:16,360
I've never installed Linux.

1466
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:39,680
Get it out of here.

1467
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,560
Thank you, MumbleRoop.

1468
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,560
You guys are wonderful.

1469
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:50,560
Yeah.

1470
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:51,560
Love your faces.

1471
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:55,080
Thank you for being here and thank you for participating and a special thank you to Ike

1472
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:58,200
and Wimpy for doing a bunch of the heavy lifting this week.

1473
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,200
That was good discussion.

1474
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,200
No problemo.

1475
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,200
Really liked that.

1476
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,320
Like you stood about.

1477
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,400
Snap into a slim cloud.

1478
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,400
That's funny.

1479
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,400
That is funny.

1480
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,400
What's that?

1481
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,400
What's this?

1482
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,040
Oh, what about, what about snap into a next cloud?

1483
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,200
That's not bad either.

1484
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,200
Snap install next cloud.

1485
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,200
Android of things.

1486
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:16,440
That's also not bad.

1487
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:19,880
I would have dropped that last topic if I could have got Wimpy to talk about it, whatever

1488
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:20,880
it was on air.

1489
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,560
I would have dropped the Android topic like it was hot.

1490
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:32,200
The only reason I'm reluctant is because I'm not sure if it's public information yet.

1491
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,200
It will be very soon.

1492
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:40,640
So when it all comes to pass, I'll explain it, but I'll explain to Ike because it's of

1493
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:45,240
relevance to some of the points he was making earlier and he's a distro maintainer and we

1494
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:51,080
want distro maintainers to think thoughtfully about supporting snaps.

1495
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,080
Sure.

1496
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,080
I bet you do.

1497
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:54,080
That would be great.

1498
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,080
It's a super cool thing.

1499
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:56,080
Yeah.

1500
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:57,080
Yeah.

1501
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,080
And you know, I'll tell you more at some point in the future.

1502
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:04,600
I think, I think it's, it could be the great equalizer for distributions like Solus.

1503
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,600
If it got enough adoption.

1504
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:09,840
Look, I mean, you've got to look at it from my angle here, right?

1505
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,040
From my perspective, I don't have the package of problems and people have tried to call

1506
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,720
me out on this before and have failed.

1507
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:20,760
From my perspective, snap is something that came into existence to address the limitations

1508
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:25,720
in the host operating systems that created them and nobody can deny that because every

1509
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:29,640
statement you see about snap, it was so hard to maintain the Debian package.

1510
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:34,400
I created Y package and solbuild and all the tolens around solus so that I didn't have

1511
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,400
that problem.

1512
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:41,360
It's very hard for me to adopt something based purely on when it, it was developed on the

1513
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,160
premise of a limitation that I don't have.

1514
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:46,640
So it really takes some serious convincing.

1515
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,640
Yeah.

1516
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:53,080
But see, I look at it from the other end from a, there are certain, there are, I would,

1517
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:57,920
I mean, if I knew today that all, anything I ever wanted to install would be a download

1518
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:04,240
and a double click, I would switch because for me, that time savings, yeah, I know.

1519
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,600
But for me that time savings, because I am window shopping essentially, not for windows,

1520
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,200
but I am, I'm window shopping software.

1521
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:13,200
I'm downloading three or four things and I'm trying them out.

1522
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:18,960
And so yeah, I, for me, like the difference between like, like if I could grab a snap

1523
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,920
of the new Lightworks beta with the new UI, I would be trying it out today.

1524
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:26,180
But because I have to wait for it to land in the different package managers, I'll try

1525
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:27,480
it out in a couple of weeks.

1526
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,080
You know, I'm not as motivated by that point.

1527
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:30,080
The news is old.

1528
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,080
It's just.

1529
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:36,640
If only I was going out for coffee with the product manager for Lightworks tomorrow morning.

1530
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:37,640
That was a thing.

1531
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:38,640
Yeah.

1532
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:39,640
Yeah.

1533
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,640
That would be amazing really.

1534
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:41,640
If you could give them a snap.

1535
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:42,640
I know.

1536
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:43,640
I know.

1537
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:44,640
If, if he was working in the same town as me, wouldn't that be incredible?

1538
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:45,640
Yeah.

1539
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,640
That would be really handy.

1540
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,920
But I follow what you're saying too, Ike.

1541
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:52,640
Like, I don't really think it's, it's too, there's not at a point where it's hurting

1542
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,080
you not to, to have it.

1543
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:56,240
So it's, you have time for it.

1544
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:57,520
It would hurt me to have it though.

1545
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,680
I mean, I kind of think we're trying to like, you know, shoot an ant with a bazooka here

1546
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:06,600
because the problem you're talking about is one that definitely exists.

1547
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:10,840
There is a continuous integration problem with getting new software.

1548
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:15,640
There are some, if we use Windows terms here, there are some titles that we'd really like

1549
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,740
to get access to.

1550
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,500
We want the latest Kdenlive.

1551
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:23,960
We want the latest OpenShort, you know, well, maybe not OpenShort, but you know, there,

1552
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:28,400
there are some things out there we really want right away, but the, the, the way that

1553
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:33,440
we're going about it is a model from the early two thousands and late nineties, which was

1554
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,440
double click this file and install it on your system.

1555
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:41,680
The world has moved on from then and people are used to using software centers.

1556
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,880
You look at Windows and you have the Windows store.

1557
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,880
You go on Android, you have the Android store.

1558
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:48,180
You go on Mac OS, you have a store.

1559
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:51,960
So I disagree with the premise of double clicking and downloading from a site.

1560
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:57,200
I know it probably can be integrated into a store afterwards, but I'm having a hard

1561
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,720
time being sold on this.

1562
01:16:58,720 --> 01:16:59,720
Okay.

1563
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:05,600
So we'll, we'll talk about this in more detail, but with regards to the store versus download

1564
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,360
from a vendor website, snaps do both.

1565
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:13,880
And there is a store implementation maintained by Canonical, but you can replace that with

1566
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,600
your own store implementation.

1567
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:21,820
And there is a reference store on GitHub that you can use if you want to do your own backend.

1568
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:25,240
So both, both paradigms are supported there.

1569
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:30,080
You're quite correct that one of the things that snaps addresses is the complexity of

1570
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,680
creating Debian packages, absolutely.

1571
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:41,640
And I also agree because I've looked at the packaging format that you use, snaps and EOPKGs

1572
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:44,100
are very similar in the way that they're constructed.

1573
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:45,680
They're both YAML files.

1574
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:50,480
They contain a lot of the same stanzas, very similar, but there are some other benefits

1575
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:54,200
and there's some other little things that are coming on stream and I'll have a chat

1576
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:59,040
to you about that and see if I can convince you that it's might, maybe worth a second

1577
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,840
consideration at some point for Solus.

1578
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:04,920
I mean, I'm not hating it on the sake for hating it because at the end of the day, it's

1579
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,920
not just about me.

1580
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:10,640
It's about the Solus users and their access to software, but I've got to do it based on

1581
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,240
technical merit and not the original.

1582
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,240
I like that.

1583
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,240
I like that as well.

1584
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,240
I think it's refreshing.

1585
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,240
Yeah, it is.

1586
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,960
I also have to think about the maintainability of an upstream.

1587
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:24,040
Now, I don't like to say this and I really don't mean this is in any way disrespectful.

1588
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:27,600
Canonical do have a history of dropping projects after a couple of years as a lack of interest.

1589
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,920
I'm not innocent myself.

1590
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:29,920
I've done the same.

1591
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:35,120
Now, I'm kind of concerned to see how Snap will play out and as to the longevity of it.

1592
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:39,960
I do think it's got more of a future than Flatpak because I think Flatpak went about

1593
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:45,320
it the wrong way, bonding of runtimes and basically overriding the operating system

1594
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,320
vendor.

1595
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:49,920
It feels like, don't you get the sense that Canonical's, I mean, they're pretty committed.

1596
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:53,160
Out of all the things they've launched in years, this feels like one that company-wide,

1597
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,160
they're sort of a line behind.

1598
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:55,160
Yeah.

1599
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:56,160
I mean, it does.

1600
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,160
The signs are there.

1601
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:01,640
The signs are positive and I am starting to come around to it more, but I just need that

1602
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,120
little something to push me over.

1603
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,120
That's fair, dude.

1604
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:05,120
Don't get me wrong.

1605
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,840
I'm quite happy to admit when I'm wrong and when that does happen, I like to be wrong.

1606
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:14,000
Imagine yourself at the edge of a cliff with a fluffy cushion beneath and there is me with

1607
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,880
a tickling stick gently coaxing you to the edge of the cliff.

1608
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:17,880
Come on.

1609
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:18,880
Come on.

1610
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:19,880
Are you fine?

1611
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:25,880
Well, I mean, once I am pushed over and it's, at this point, it's become an inevitable.

1612
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,360
I'm just doing the last childish resistance.

1613
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,360
Yeah.

1614
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,680
Well, you're still, I mean, it's natural.

1615
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:32,680
It's natural.

1616
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:36,080
I like to think, I like to hear about the thought that goes in behind the distro, too.

1617
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,080
That's nice.

1618
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:38,720
And there's some good adversarial process going on.

1619
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:42,360
Yeah, but I mean, once it happens, I'm quite happy to stick it in the top or something.

1620
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:47,920
I mean, I half an hour ago were, you know, singing the chorus from the same song sheet.

1621
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:54,320
And now, now you can see us slightly offset from one another, slightly grating, you know.

1622
01:19:54,320 --> 01:20:02,440
So this this competitive disagreement can happen cordially and it and it's fine.

1623
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,440
Yeah.

1624
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:04,440
Yeah.

1625
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:09,160
I just I wish that some of the online press could maybe hear this discussion that Ike

1626
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:14,440
and I are having now where we're agreeing to disagree to some extent, but we're prepared

1627
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:17,400
to talk about it a bit more after the fact.

1628
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:26,720
And and also just stop saying that open source projects are fiercely competing with one another

1629
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:34,240
at the expense of collaboration, because it's simply not true that there is so much collaboration

1630
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:41,200
that silently goes on in the background between large organizations and small projects and

1631
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:44,880
the commentators simply don't appreciate that it's happening.

1632
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:50,160
So hopefully this evening or this afternoon or this morning, however you're listening

1633
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:54,560
to this, we've pulled back the curtain on that a little, just a little bit and let you

1634
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:59,320
know that actually, when you say these desktop environments are not working together and

1635
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:04,560
are not pulling in the same direction, we really are, because the one thing we all want

1636
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:15,400
is quality Linux desktops to emerge to build a user base and pull more users and gravity

1637
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,400
to our projects.

1638
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:23,160
My sense is it'll have to be a sustained campaign of of continually highlighting in a way that

1639
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:31,000
is genuine and also interesting, because I feel like that narrative comes from the need

1640
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,200
to write a quippy register headline or something like that.

1641
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:38,840
That's where some of that narrative comes from, is the way that the model of that business

1642
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:42,800
is so click driven.

1643
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,720
We all need each other at the end of the day.

1644
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:49,600
As much as we might all compete with each other, we need each other to be doing well,

1645
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,360
because then it keeps us on our best form, it forces us to look at ourselves, which sometimes

1646
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,360
is very hard.

1647
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:58,920
You don't want to look at yourself, but it forces us to, and we have to keep improving.

1648
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:02,000
Once we do that, whoever you're competing with, they've got to do the same thing as

1649
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
well.

1650
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,480
Now, some people are going to look back on this conversation and in a couple of weeks,

1651
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:10,560
someone would join on the Solus channel and said, I heard you, you was on Linux unplugged,

1652
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:17,080
you was very angry, because people don't understand this.

1653
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,080
We have to disagree.

1654
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,160
We can't agree on everything.

1655
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:23,360
There are things we are going to agree on, but if we didn't disagree, then everyone gets

1656
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:27,200
a sub-powered watered down product with a unified vision.

1657
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,400
We need those competing things.

1658
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,400
We need those things.

1659
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,200
You need to create friction to create fire.

1660
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,200
That's what we're doing.

1661
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:37,280
This is going to sound very odd, but we all rub against each other in slightly the wrong

1662
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,280
ways.

1663
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:41,260
When you create a fire, we need to move Linux forward.

1664
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:42,680
We all think we're right.

1665
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:47,640
We all think that our direct direction is the right one, but we're all building on common

1666
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:48,640
technologies.

1667
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:49,640
That's the thing.

1668
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,280
That is really the core thing.

1669
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:57,080
That's why it is so funny that I think it's lazy, too.

1670
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:04,240
It's really easy to see a new application announced, or a new desktop environment announced,

1671
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:08,640
or a new distribution announced, and it's super easy to go, oh, well, look at us just

1672
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:11,720
spinning our wheels again, and not taking the time to go, well, what are they doing

1673
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:14,760
that's new and actually interesting?

1674
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:19,080
Because a lot of times, okay, legitimately, a lot of times there are people that are just

1675
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:23,480
sort of maybe they're rage forking, and that has contributed to this as well, but a lot

1676
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:26,880
of times there's real actual good work happening, and it's not just about forks.

1677
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:27,880
It's about sharing code.

1678
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:28,880
It's about working together.

1679
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,440
It's about building on common technologies, and that's not the discussion.

1680
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:37,080
The problem is that every time there is a fork, it's often portrayed as a rage fork

1681
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:41,200
without necessarily understanding the motivations behind doing that.

1682
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:45,120
Amartey was perceived as that when that was forked from GNOME 2.

1683
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:52,960
Now it was forked out of frustration, but it was also forked to preserve a desktop paradigm

1684
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:58,280
that was well thought out and well tested, and I would like to see that desktop paradigm

1685
01:23:58,280 --> 01:23:59,280
preserved.

1686
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,280
Yeah.

1687
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:09,000
Ike also talked about when we see other desktops doing things and it drives us forward.

1688
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:16,780
When I saw Daniel in the summer and he showed me what at that time was an alpha or a beta

1689
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:24,080
of elementary and the work they'd done on high DPI, I realized just how far behind Amartey

1690
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:33,880
was in respect to high DPI because they really stepped on considerably, considering that

1691
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:39,840
they were based on a desktop environment that didn't have all of the high DPI stuff at the

1692
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,640
outset and they've had to implement it, and Amartey's coming from the same position, unlike

1693
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:52,040
Ike who started in a position of having a lot of that stuff in place in the first place.

1694
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:59,400
So I realized that in order to keep up with elementary, high DPI is a top priority for

1695
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:00,400
the Amartey desktop.

1696
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:01,400
Oh yeah.

1697
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,400
Preach it.

1698
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:09,600
I'm quite happy to acknowledge that elementary's got the superior solution there and so is

1699
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:16,960
Budgie right now, but we'll catch up and we'll catch up because I can learn and we can learn

1700
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:20,040
from Budgie and Pantheon.

1701
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,040
Yeah.

1702
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,040
I love it.

1703
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:23,040
Well Budgie cheated.

1704
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:29,680
One last confession to actually add there, speaking of Budgie, speaking of desktop and

1705
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:35,600
speaking of Brisk, so one recommendation I would like to make to any budding developer

1706
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:40,520
who's listening to us now, I would say that I'm quite an experienced software engineer

1707
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:41,520
by now.

1708
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,360
I've been doing this for a while.

1709
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:48,400
When I started Budgie there was a lot of things I could get away with because I was making

1710
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:53,840
it for Solus and all of that, every single one of those decisions has come back to bite

1711
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:57,600
me on the arse in the most horrific and splendid of ways.

1712
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,600
That's a very honest review.

1713
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,040
I bet it is.

1714
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:06,320
With the Brisk menu I started out knowing almost immediately that this is going to be

1715
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:10,120
something that not just Solus is going to be using this.

1716
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:15,560
I can't get away with gotten cornered here and as a result I'm doing it properly and

1717
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:21,520
I had to go digging through the source code of GTK for some very, very badly documented

1718
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:27,400
functions they claim to get and instead do and send and then return.

1719
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:31,800
So it forced me to rethink how I was doing things and to truly investigate and that's

1720
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:36,040
how Budgie benefited because I actually went and did it properly because I knew it would

1721
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:39,780
have to be something that would stand up, not just on Solus where I can get away with

1722
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:42,760
including it, but everywhere.

1723
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:48,160
So if you start with that mindset then everybody benefits and you create better software.

1724
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:55,640
And the other way that Solus and Budgie will benefit from this is that Ubuntu Mate are

1725
01:26:55,640 --> 01:27:05,280
embarking on a multi-month funding of this development work and that money iKey can use

1726
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:11,280
to invest into whatever initiatives are important to the Solus project.

1727
01:27:11,280 --> 01:27:12,280
Which is money...

1728
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:17,280
Alt-Tab, Alt-Tab, please fix it.

1729
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:24,520
Oh, I don't remember which machine I have set aside, but I do think I have a machine

1730
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:25,960
I could put Solus on.

1731
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:27,960
I think something happened to the Apollo though.

1732
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:32,360
I don't remember what, but both my XPS and my Apollo are not currently booting.

1733
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:33,360
That is some bad luck.

1734
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,360
What did you do to it?

1735
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:35,360
I think the Apollo...

1736
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,360
It's not that Fedora you were installing, wasn't it?

1737
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:40,120
Yeah, I think the Apollo was the Fedora 25 install that broke.

1738
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:43,200
I think that's just a software thing, but I can't remember.

1739
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:47,600
And then the XPS, I think my little m.drive died on me, which just drives me crazy because

1740
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,240
that's like the second one I've lost now.

1741
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:52,240
But the XPS...

1742
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:55,040
You're making notes as to what manufacturers are behind these drives.

1743
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,040
Yeah, you're right.

1744
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:57,600
But we need notes for a rant later.

1745
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:02,540
I'm a little disappointed though, because I feel like the XPS 13 with that infinity

1746
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:06,240
display would just make such a beautiful computer to run Solus on.

1747
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,240
I would really like...

1748
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:10,560
I'm just so sick of dealing with broken drives.

1749
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,560
Yeah, it's so frustrating.

1750
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,560
With what?

1751
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:15,320
What are you sick with dealing with?

1752
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:18,320
I just have machines...

1753
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:23,240
Not only did I have the m.die in the XPS, and now for whatever reason the Apollo isn't booting,

1754
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:27,240
but also my OG, my first Bonobo, won't turn on now.

1755
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:28,240
And it just dies.

1756
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:29,800
Even if I remove the battery.

1757
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,920
So I've actually had three laptops die on me recently.

1758
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:33,920
That's tragic.

1759
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:34,920
Man.

1760
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:37,200
Yeah, I know.

1761
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:43,840
So if you've got dying laptops, what sort of laptop is there a gap for in your laptop

1762
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:45,320
requirements right now?

1763
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,320
The range.

1764
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:51,520
The only laptop I have that I can reload right now, ironically, is the Librem.

1765
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:52,520
That's the one machine...

1766
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:53,520
Hey!

1767
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:54,520
It's finally coming in useful.

1768
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:55,520
Took a while.

1769
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,520
So that's my...

1770
01:28:56,520 --> 01:29:04,680
And then I have the MacBook running Arch, which has now become my daily driver now though.

1771
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:08,080
Which is not ideal, because the battery life is really horrendous on that thing.

1772
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:11,560
And the other thing about the MacBook Pro that's really frustrating is just browsing

1773
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:15,020
the web causes the fans to go on that thing.

1774
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:16,840
And under Mac OS, it's silent.

1775
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:20,320
And then so under Linux, having the fans run all the time, but it still feels warm to the

1776
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:21,320
touch.

1777
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:22,320
Like it just, it's all off.

1778
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:23,320
It's all off.

1779
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:24,320
Slowly melting.

1780
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,320
Yeah, it feels like it.

1781
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:26,320
Like I'm slowly killing my MacBook.

1782
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,960
So yeah.

1783
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:30,840
But it's a quad core with a terabyte SSD.

1784
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,040
And a beautiful screen.

1785
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:33,040
Yeah.

1786
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:36,440
So it's kind of my go to, like, I'm going to be doing some work and I want a 15 inch

1787
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:37,440
screen.

1788
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:38,440
Right.

1789
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,440
And you can plug in.

1790
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,600
Describe the laptop that you want right now.

1791
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:42,600
It ranges.

1792
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:43,600
I mean, it really does.

1793
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:44,600
It depends on the job.

1794
01:29:44,600 --> 01:29:47,320
I think there's a spot for something like the XPS.

1795
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:52,880
But I was kind of, after talking to you about the XPS 15, I was also kind of thinking about

1796
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,160
maybe making that the next Linux box.

1797
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:56,160
I don't know.

1798
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:57,160
I'm all over the place, really.

1799
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:02,180
Because I could, I could make use out of a really high end machine doing OBS and shenanigans

1800
01:30:02,180 --> 01:30:03,180
like that.

1801
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:07,440
Or I could make use out of a little low end machine doing show prep and web browsing.

1802
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,440
So it's sort of.

1803
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:10,800
And what about something to test distros on?

1804
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,640
Have you got a machine to do that or is that a machine that you need?

1805
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:14,640
That's the Librem right now.

1806
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:19,200
And the downside to that, and it's nice because I can, I can test Intel drivers, but like

1807
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:22,800
with Fedora and often there's like a little, there's little issues with the NVIDIA driver

1808
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:23,800
that I just don't know.

1809
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:28,040
I currently don't have a machine to test on because that was my Bonobo, but now the Bonobo

1810
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:29,040
don't boot.

1811
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,040
Bonobo don't boot.

1812
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,040
Yeah.

1813
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,040
Yeah.

1814
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,040
But I was able to play around with Wayland.

1815
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:35,040
So it sort of worked out.

1816
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,040
Yeah.

1817
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:38,880
It's hard because you kind of need a diverse, a diverse set of chipsets.

1818
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:39,880
Yeah.

1819
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:40,880
Yeah.

1820
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:41,880
Kind of need a lot because I.

1821
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:42,880
Yeah, exactly.

1822
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,520
I don't usually have anything in the very high end performance range right now, but

1823
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:46,520
most.

1824
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:47,520
You don't have any AMD.

1825
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,360
No, but most things in the mid range are usually powerful enough these days.

1826
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,240
I'm all over the place wimpy.

1827
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:53,240
You know, you can't nail me down.

1828
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,240
I know.

1829
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,240
Yeah.

1830
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:56,240
It's a, this is a tricky conversation.

1831
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:57,240
Yeah.

1832
01:30:57,240 --> 01:31:00,680
Well, cause basically there's a spot in the lineup for all types of hardware.

1833
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:04,240
Because if you think about it in terms of review, both are, I like to, I would like

1834
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:06,360
to review on the high end of hardware and on the low end.

1835
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:09,760
So yeah.

1836
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:12,720
For my daily use myself, I like something as powerful as possible.

1837
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:15,760
I would say the Apollo probably falls a little short as a two core.

1838
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,280
You want four?

1839
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:18,280
Yeah.

1840
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:19,760
But then I also don't want it to be.

1841
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:20,760
Well, you want battery life.

1842
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:21,760
Yeah.

1843
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:22,760
And you don't want it to be loud.

1844
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:23,760
Yeah.

1845
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:24,760
Yeah.

1846
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:25,760
I'm all over the place.

1847
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:33,600
I've, I still use my Apollo as my lightweight, you know, go, go, go out and use computer.

1848
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:39,880
But when I need to travel and I need a workhorse to do work on, but I don't want something

1849
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:44,520
heavy, I've got a fully full tilt, um, XPS 13.

1850
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:45,520
Oh 13.

1851
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:46,520
Hmm.

1852
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:47,520
Hmm.

1853
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:48,520
Yeah.

1854
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,520
Cause that's, that's small enough and light enough that I can stick it in my backpack.

1855
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:51,520
Oh, for sure.

1856
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,440
And pack my pants and socks and my toothbrush and toothpaste and all the rest of it.

1857
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:56,440
Yep.

1858
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:57,440
Yep.

1859
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,440
Yep.

1860
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:01,920
Um, but if I want to, you know, just, um, go down to the, uh, the pub on a Saturday

1861
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:07,920
afternoon and do some work, then, uh, I take the Apollo because that's got a larger, a

1862
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,400
larger battery screen.

1863
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:13,520
And it's lighter weight and uh, yeah, the battery actually lasts longer because the

1864
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:18,560
XPS 13 is a UHD display, so it burns through the battery a bit faster.

1865
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,760
So yeah, so you know, it's, it's difficult.

1866
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:28,920
So I, I found that I need about five laptops, uh, find all of the niches that I need.

1867
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:29,920
Yeah.

1868
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,760
That's kind of what I hate to say, but like if I'm doing reviews and sometimes I'm doing

1869
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:36,040
really high end production stuff and sometimes I'm just browsing the web, reading emails

1870
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:38,400
and there's a different machine.

1871
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:43,880
So my, my sort of test machine is the XPS 15 because it's got both Intel embedded and

1872
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:45,280
Nvidia discrete graphics.

1873
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,280
Yeah.

1874
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,280
Yeah.

1875
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:50,680
So you get to test both on that and it's got a 4k screen and all the rest.

1876
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:54,160
That's why I was kind of looking at, you can do more than 16 gigs of Ram too, right?

1877
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:55,160
You can do up to like 32.

1878
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:56,160
I've got 32 in mine.

1879
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:57,160
Yeah.

1880
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,160
That's, that's awesome.

1881
01:32:58,160 --> 01:32:59,480
That's hitting the sweet spot for me.

1882
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:01,960
And how is it thinness and heavy and weight wise?

1883
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:03,440
Uh, it's great.

1884
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,440
I've got it, I've got it just on the floor here.

1885
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:09,280
It's yeah, it's, it's, um, it's not, it's not heavy.

1886
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:14,680
It's about the same, uh, thickness, slightly thicker than the XPS 13 only slightly.

1887
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:15,680
Yeah.

1888
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:19,280
It's got the same keyboard as the XPS 13, exactly the same.

1889
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:22,960
Uh, it's just got a wider, you know, um, palm rest area.

1890
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:23,960
Is the trackpad bigger?

1891
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:24,960
Is the trackpad?

1892
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:25,960
It's the same.

1893
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:26,960
No, it's, uh, that's a good question.

1894
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:30,760
I haven't measured it, but it's, it's big and no it's much, but actually it's much bigger

1895
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:31,760
thinking about it.

1896
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:32,760
Yeah.

1897
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:33,760
It's much bigger.

1898
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:34,760
Yeah.

1899
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:38,600
And you know, the other nice thing about that is I'm pretty sure Dell still accepts Bitcoin.

1900
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:40,160
So that's very appealing.

1901
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:41,160
Yeah.

1902
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:42,480
I bought mine with Bitcoin.

1903
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:46,720
Wimpy, are you playing it all with LibreVault or what's, uh, what's your latest experiments

1904
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:47,720
in syncing?

1905
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:48,880
Not, not recently.

1906
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:53,620
So I was using it, oh, I don't know, some months ago, three, four months ago, uh, did

1907
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:58,400
a little test, but what I was using it for, I've switched to a different tool so I don't

1908
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,400
have it right now.

1909
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:00,400
Uh, have I heard of the tool?

1910
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,400
Sorry?

1911
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:04,400
Have I heard of the tool you switched to?

1912
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,920
Um, probably not.

1913
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:09,280
It's called, it's called Yadim, Y-A-D-M.

1914
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,280
I haven't, I haven't either.

1915
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:16,120
It's yet another dot manager, uh, so it's a dot file manager and this is what I use to

1916
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:19,820
manage my whole roaming profile thing now.

1917
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:21,560
And Wes, you want this in your life.

1918
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:22,560
It's amazing.

1919
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,640
That does sound amazing.

1920
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:29,200
I feel like we had, that might've been, we had a dot file manager on our picks runner

1921
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:32,480
up list for last recently and I don't think we put it in the show.

1922
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:36,800
So it works like Git, instead of, instead of typing Git, you type Yadim, um, and then

1923
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,040
all of the Git, you know, commands follow as, as you would expect.

1924
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:41,040
I see.

1925
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:42,040
So it kind of just wraps it.

1926
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:43,040
Yeah.

1927
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,240
Uh, but you can, it's got crypting in there as well.

1928
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:50,480
So for example, anything sensitive that you want in your dot files, you can encrypt those

1929
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:55,840
as when you store them in the Git repository, uh, and then decrypt them when you pull them

1930
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:56,840
out.

1931
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:57,840
This is the dream.

1932
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:03,720
All of my, um, my VPN keys and things are in my dot file Git repository, but all of

1933
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:05,440
that stuff's encrypted.

1934
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,120
So what are you not syncing the config of?

1935
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:09,720
Is there any application that's caused too much trouble or it's not worth it?

1936
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:11,560
Is there anything you just don't sync?

1937
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:17,720
No, pretty much everything that I rely on is synced either the dot file that it uses

1938
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:26,200
directly or I export certain, uh, G setting branches for applications and then have a

1939
01:35:26,200 --> 01:35:27,200
script.

1940
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:33,000
So in my Yadim dot files, I also have a scripts directory and one of those is to restore those,

1941
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:39,200
um, decomp dumps so that, um, when I check out that I can run a script and everything

1942
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:58,200
just comes back.
