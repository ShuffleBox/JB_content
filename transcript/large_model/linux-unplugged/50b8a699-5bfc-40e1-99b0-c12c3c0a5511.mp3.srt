1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,780
I think, Kev, the reason Wimpy's not here is because we did our time change last weekend, and you do yours next week.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,380
Yeah, oh boy. Oh boy.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,180
Okay, what's happening, Wes? Will you break it down? We're falling...

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,680
I don't know, Chris. How can I know? This is an arcane system. It makes no sense.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,180
Hold on, are you serious? You don't know?

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,620
Okay, we're falling back.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,160
Does that mean it gets darker earlier or lighter earlier?

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,420
Dammit, just tell me which one it is, Wes.

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,260
This is too much fun.

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,460
No, come on, Wes! I've been trying to figure this out for...

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,460
It gets darker earlier.

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,960
Okay, thank you. Okay, I've been trying to figure this out for two days.

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,960
Yeah, that also gets lighter earlier.

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,960
So, you know, it's already... this is a problem. This is a real problem. It already gets dark way too early.

15
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,460
And I gotta be honest with you guys, I start getting sleepy as soon as it gets dark.

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,960
Oh, I know. It's like, well, eight o'clock, I guess it's bedtime.

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,460
Yeah, it is a big problem. It is a...

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,960
I screw getting lighter earlier. Screw that. I don't need it to get lighter earlier.

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,460
Then I just feel pressure to wake up earlier.

20
00:00:52,460 --> 00:01:00,960
Well, and sometimes, as soon as it's... I do, actually. I usually get up around 530. It's usually when I'm up.

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,460
I like X-Metal's point here.

22
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:04,960
What is that?

23
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,460
Maybe J.B. Time should just be agnostic.

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,460
Just make UTC the thing you've pinned to.

25
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,460
All the best places use UTC.

26
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,460
We're on UTC now.

27
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,460
Hello, Wendy!

28
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:16,960
Hello.

29
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,460
Hello.

30
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:17,960
Hello.

31
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,460
Hey, do you want...

32
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,460
I've just been caught out by TimeMath. I'm very sorry.

33
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,460
Yes, we were kind of thinking that might be the case.

34
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:32,460
I just wanted to do a little, when we get into the show, a little Ubuntu Mate 15.10 yak-a-yak, if you would, with us.

35
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,460
I think that'd be very nice.

36
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,460
Well, that'd be delightful. I'll look forward to it.

37
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,460
And somehow I'm driving all the way to Liverpool in a couple of days' time. I mean, how did this happen?

38
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:49,460
Oh, by the way, who's calling shotgun? I think Mark should sit in the front and I'll sit in the back so I can write my presentation.

39
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,460
All-time shotgun.

40
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,460
Sure, sure, sure. You can do shotgun to Laura's and then sit in the back.

41
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,460
No, I want to sit in the back. I want to sit in the back the whole time so that you're my chauffeur all the way to Liverpool.

42
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:00,960
Yeah.

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,460
I don't want to have to sit with the workers.

44
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,460
Let me work this out. Let me work this out. I'm just going to extrapolate here.

45
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,460
Would you like me to wear leather driving gloves and a peaked cap?

46
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,460
Wear whatever the hell you like.

47
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,460
We're playing dress-up, don't mind.

48
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,460
You just want to look like Miss Daisy in the back of my car, is that right?

49
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,460
Only on the weekends.

50
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,460
All I heard was leather.

51
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,460
Oh, boy.

52
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,460
Oh, hello, Chris.

53
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:35,460
I've decided I'm going to move. I've got to move somewhere where it's sunny. Where can I go where it's sunnier right now? Where do I got to go?

54
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,460
Australia.

55
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,460
Australia?

56
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,460
Sunnyvale.

57
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,460
That's what I was thinking, Australia.

58
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,460
Where it's sunny right now.

59
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,460
Yeah.

60
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,460
Six months of sun in the South Pole.

61
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,460
Yeah, I could do that, yeah. Then I could be more productive. Then I could be more productive. That's what I was thinking.

62
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:51,460
You're looking at a talk show that's ready.

63
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,460
It is nice, sunny, and 70 degrees out.

64
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,460
Where are you?

65
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,460
I got to go. That's ridiculous.

66
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,460
Looks familiar. He's yelling at me in IRC.

67
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,460
What?

68
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,460
I live in Texas, man, and it's sunny all day from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m.

69
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:12,460
Well, it would be 9 p.m. still, really, because the thing is I can feel my productivity is going to start falling off.

70
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,460
It's time to hibernate soon.

71
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:24,460
Well, because our time zone change is going to make it darker sooner, and something with me, I think it's probably because I don't get good sleep or something.

72
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:28,460
As soon as it starts getting dark or whatever, I'm an old man. As soon as it starts getting dark, I start falling asleep.

73
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,460
I start getting tired. My energy drops way off.

74
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,460
It's the release of melatonin that does that.

75
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,460
I know. I'm 33. I know. I mean, I'm not actually that old, but I don't know what it is.

76
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,460
It's been for the last two years.

77
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,460
I remember when I was 33.

78
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,460
Now, listen. You mock. You mock, but it is so bad. I thought there was something wrong with me.

79
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,460
Well, there might be. Don't discount me.

80
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,460
Okay. All right. Because for the last couple of years...

81
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,460
We had a horse and a trap when I was 33.

82
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,460
For the last couple of years, I was like, why am I falling asleep at like 6 o'clock, 6.30 at night?

83
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,460
What is wrong with me?

84
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,460
And then as it started getting lighter out, I started staying up later.

85
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,460
And then I started staying up later.

86
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,460
And then I'm up at 11 o'clock at night, and I'm feeling just fine.

87
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,460
And in the middle of summer, I'm like, oh, because there's sunlight.

88
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,460
And then as soon as it starts getting...

89
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,460
You guys, I'm starting to get tired around 7.30 when the sun set.

90
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,460
It is ridiculous.

91
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,460
So basically, I've got from 5.30...

92
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,460
From about really 6... Well, really, who's going to get out of the house?

93
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,460
So from about 7.30 a.m. to about 7 o'clock p.m., that's my window of opportunity right there to do anything.

94
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,460
And if it doesn't get done in that time period, it's not getting done.

95
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,460
We need to get you some nice solar temperature lights in your rover.

96
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,460
The truth is, I just got too much work. I need to work till 11 o'clock.

97
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,460
That's how my life is structured.

98
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,460
I have a job that expects me to be available till 11, and I can't make it past 7.30.

99
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,460
Actually, 8.30, really.

100
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,460
Yeah, so I tell you, maybe I'll get one of those satellites.

101
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,460
Yeah, there you go.

102
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,460
You would think being in a studio full of lights...

103
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,460
The ones up in a constellation are the ones attached to the side of your house.

104
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,460
No, like, you know, those seasonal affective disorder lights that, like, give you...

105
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,460
I've got Hughes lights.

106
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,460
This is not as cool as I thought it would be.

107
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,460
No, in fact, one of the things that's really kind of neat with these Hughes lights is, check this out.

108
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,460
Now, Wes, tell me this doesn't actually feel a little bit different.

109
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,460
Tell me you don't notice a little difference when I do this.

110
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,460
I'm going to hit the button here. It's called Energize.

111
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,460
Ooh, suddenly I'm awake, alert, ready for a podcast.

112
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,460
It does feel a little more like...look, don't you feel energized?

113
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,460
Yeah, this is a great feeling.

114
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,460
I didn't hear the energize sound.

115
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,460
All right, so here's the difference.

116
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,460
All right, so here's before right here, right?

117
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,460
See, there's before, and here's after.

118
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,460
Boom.

119
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,460
Now I need to open a browser.

120
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,460
Yeah, you do, you do. See, before...

121
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,460
Hang on, hang on.

122
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,460
That's kind of boring, right? It's kind of sleepy.

123
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,460
Sad, sleepy Chris.

124
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,460
Yeah.

125
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,460
Does that only work with a cell phone?

126
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,460
All right, go on, go on, do it again, do it again.

127
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,460
Okay, so here's sleepy mode.

128
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,460
This is what we're going to start the show with.

129
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,460
Now here is energize mode. Boom.

130
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,460
Boom. You see that? Big difference, big difference.

131
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,460
It basically...and I have other modes too, like...

132
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,460
Oh, right, okay.

133
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,460
Here's concentrate, which I don't like as much.

134
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,460
Oh, that's kind of intense.

135
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,460
Yeah, here's sunset.

136
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,460
Yeah, now it just got warm in here, didn't it?

137
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,460
Day is done.

138
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,460
This is Greece.

139
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,460
Oh, it's green. That's weird.

140
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,460
God, I can actually see you, Chris.

141
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,460
This is unnatural. I don't normally do that.

142
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,460
Sorry, there, that's better.

143
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,460
I think it's fixed.

144
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,460
Put the curtain back up. Yeah, that sounds good.

145
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,460
All right.

146
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,460
So what does Philips Hues run on?

147
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,460
Just a mobile phone app or...?

148
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,460
Well, no, actually...

149
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,460
Actually, they have...

150
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,460
They even have, like, a Python API for it.

151
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,460
Like, pretty much anything.

152
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,460
There's all kinds of things you can use to set it,

153
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,460
but the consumer out-of-the-box expectation is a mobile device.

154
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,460
Oh, I see.

155
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,460
So do you have to firmware update your lights?

156
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,460
Not the lights themselves, but the controller, yeah.

157
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,460
I don't know if it was the hues,

158
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,460
but I saw Matthew Garrett talking about

159
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,460
how one of the lights he has has Netcat on it,

160
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,460
which is pretty disturbing.

161
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,460
I don't know about these.

162
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,460
I mean, it does have a little controller,

163
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,460
and it does need updates from time to time.

164
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,460
You know, they're pretty obvious for a studio use.

165
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,460
Having color control over your lights is pretty obvious.

166
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,460
Without you having to go fiddle with the gels?

167
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,460
You know, I was talking to Benjamin Karenza.

168
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,460
Did I say his name?

169
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,460
Karenza?

170
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,460
Karenza.

171
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,460
Karenza, right.

172
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,460
That's right, Benjamin Karenza, thank you.

173
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,460
And he was talking about how you could tie in

174
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,460
his Glucosio app,

175
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,460
which checks for, like, your blood sugar levels and whatnot,

176
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,460
with hues lights

177
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,460
to change the light of the hues

178
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,460
depending on your blood sugar.

179
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,460
Karenza, yeah.

180
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,460
We just need to record you saying it correct once,

181
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,460
and you can just have that as a clip ready to go.

182
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,460
I know! I've got a frickin' soundboard!

183
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,460
And also, whilst you're on form there

184
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,460
with correct pronunciation, go on,

185
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,460
do un-ter-gos just once.

186
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,460
Un-ter-gos.

187
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,460
You gave it!

188
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,460
Creative commons, everyone.

189
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,460
Creative commons!

190
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,460
I've never installed gnu-slash-lux.

191
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,460
I just need to replace all these Richard Stallman clips

192
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,460
with me saying things correctly.

193
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,460
That's all I need to do, and that'll solve the problem.

194
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,460
This is

195
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,460
Linux Unplugged, episode 116

196
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,460
for October 27th, 2015.

197
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,460
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly

198
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,460
Linux talk show that's ready to

199
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,460
head out and find the sunshine.

200
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,460
My name is Chris. My name is Wes.

201
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,460
I'm just saying I get sleepy in the fall, Wes.

202
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,460
That's all I'm saying. I do, too. Maybe after this

203
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,460
we'll take a nap. Actually,

204
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,460
you did bring us Red Bulls before the show.

205
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,460
I'm doing my part. I'm doing my part. We gotta have

206
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,460
a show somehow. It's been a long time since I've had Red

207
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,460
Bull, too, so when you crack it open, it's got that

208
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,460
distinct Red Bull smell.

209
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,460
Yes, it does. But we are well caffeinated

210
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,460
for today's episode of Linux Unplugged.

211
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,460
We're gonna get into, well, a few things.

212
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,460
First of all, we're gonna chat with Wimpy

213
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,460
about some of the new things in Ubuntu Mate

214
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,460
15.10. I'm looking forward to that.

215
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,460
Big win for the EFF that benefits

216
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,460
Linux users. We're gonna chat about that.

217
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,460
Why Intel x86 platform

218
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,460
is gonna be, just basically,

219
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,460
we gotta write it off. We gotta write it off.

220
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,460
We're done. I love me some x86 CPUs.

221
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,460
We gotta write them off, you guys. You think I'm kidding?

222
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,460
Actually, a really, really compelling

223
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,460
report just came out on why we have to do that and why Linux

224
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,460
users are in the best position to take advantage of that.

225
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,460
It's from the guy who created Cube OS.

226
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,460
And then later on after that,

227
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,460
we're gonna, right here,

228
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,460
right now, we're gonna admit

229
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,460
that Richard Stallman was right. In what may become

230
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,460
a reoccurring segment at this point,

231
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,460
he nailed it. RMS nailed it.

232
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,460
This week, a judge declared that

233
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,460
because an iOS user does

234
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,460
not own their software,

235
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,460
Apple can be legally compelled to unlock

236
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,460
the device. Because,

237
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,460
by Apple's very own EULA, that user

238
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,460
doesn't own their device. They don't own

239
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,460
their device. Apple owns their device. The OS

240
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,460
that runs on their device. And so because of that,

241
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,460
Apple has to unlock it.

242
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,460
Wow, is that not a huge

243
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,460
red flag, and exactly what Richard Stallman

244
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,460
warned us about, and exactly something

245
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,460
that Linux users should be thinking about.

246
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,460
And then after all of that,

247
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,460
some really sleek new

248
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,460
hardware could be coming out for Linux users.

249
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,460
I believe, now I've been working

250
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,460
on this. I believe it's pronounced

251
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,460
YaoMei.

252
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,460
Sounds good, Chris. Damn it, Wes.

253
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,460
YaoMei. And they have something really

254
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,460
interesting up their sleeves. So before we get into

255
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,460
all of that, let's bring in the Mumble Room. Time

256
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,460
appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

257
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,460
Good morning.

258
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,460
Hello. Hello.

259
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,460
Hi. Hi. Hi. So,

260
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,460
you guys may or may not recall, a couple

261
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,460
of weeks ago, we played

262
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,460
the Linux Foundation's The World Without

263
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,460
Linux episode. Let's

264
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,460
play their second one that just came out, and

265
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,460
then we're going to play Critics.

266
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,460
So we're going to mystery science this thing. You ready?

267
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,460
So here it is, The World Without Linux

268
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,460
episode number two, by the way, with a

269
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,460
real serious guitar intro.

270
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,460
Alright.

271
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,460
Road trips are the best, but

272
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,460
I think we are totally lost.

273
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,460
Don't fret, dude. I brought a trusty map.

274
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,460
Dude. So, a map.

275
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,460
All I have to do is convert inches into

276
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,460
miles and cross-reference our perceived location

277
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,460
with the mile markers on the road.

278
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,460
Uh, my bad.

279
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,460
Map goes out the window. Don't worry.

280
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,460
As a backup, I printed out directions.

281
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,460
These two aren't going to make it.

282
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,460
Broken up by the end of the series.

283
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,460
You take a left on...

284
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,460
flight right on... right.

285
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,460
Now... What in the world are you saying?

286
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,460
Sorry. The printer cut off the directions

287
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,460
on the side. Ah, MapQuest.

288
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,460
I hope you never, ever go

289
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,460
away.

290
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,460
Okay, well, I think U-turn.

291
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,460
Wait, U-turn? I was supposed to make it U-turn?

292
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,460
No, U-turn. Wait, are you saying

293
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,460
U-turn or you should turn?

294
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,460
Right. Are you saying right as

295
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,460
correct or turn right?

296
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,460
Stop. Wait, are you saying stop it

297
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,460
or stop the car?

298
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,460
A world without Linux

299
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,460
would mean a world without direction.

300
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,460
We are

301
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,460
so lost.

302
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,460
When do you think we'll get there?

303
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,460
Alright, let's see. No, I'm going to do this. Okay, so if a train leaves New York

304
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,460
at three o'clock. Okay, wait. Carry the one.

305
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,460
You want miles, not kilometers, right?

306
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,460
Okay, the way it looks to me, we're going to be there by...

307
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,460
Halloween.

308
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,460
A world without Linux is hard to imagine.

309
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,460
Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of

310
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,460
individuals and companies who support Linux,

311
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,460
so we don't have to.

312
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,460
Learn more and help support Linux

313
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,460
today.

314
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,460
Wait, that sign says Bermuda Triangle Street

315
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,460
ahead. Finally, some good news.

316
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,460
Oh, I know, right?

317
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,460
Sounds tropical.

318
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,460
Oh, hashtag world without Linux.

319
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,460
So what do you think, Wes?

320
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,460
Are you impressed by the world without Linux

321
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,460
series so far? There really wasn't very much

322
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,460
of Linux in it, so I guess that's good.

323
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,460
You know... Chris.

324
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,460
Yes, yeah, go ahead, Buffy.

325
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,460
Is this a cultural difference

326
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,460
between you guys and us, or is that

327
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,460
just not funny in any

328
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,460
way shape or form?

329
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,460
No, I think you're right there, Buffy.

330
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,460
It's pretty much not funny, Buffy. Not only is

331
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,460
it not funny, but I don't get the premise.

332
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,460
Like, if she has printed out directions,

333
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,460
what did she print them from?

334
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,460
Probably the Internet, and then he references MapQuest.

335
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,460
Which is probably running Linux.

336
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,460
And I think the fundamental, and maybe I'm overthinking this, but I think the other

337
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,460
fundamental thing is like, it sort of assumes

338
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,460
that something wouldn't come up in its place, like

339
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,460
a BSD or something like that. I love the

340
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,460
idea, though, and I love the basic

341
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,460
idea that they're trying to convey. That's the

342
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,460
part I should say. I love that. I love the idea

343
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,460
they're trying to convey is Linux makes the world

344
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,460
easier in a way you don't even realize.

345
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,460
Spotlighting how it builds all the common infrastructure.

346
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,460
Do you think maybe these

347
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,460
promotions

348
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,460
are not aimed at us?

349
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,460
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Exactly correct.

350
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,460
Do you think this is more suitable for my

351
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,460
mum when I want to explain what Linux

352
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,460
is and what it's done for the world?

353
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,460
I do think so. I think it's kind of fun.

354
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,460
I'm glad they're putting it out there, and

355
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,460
you know, I've noticed that the first episode

356
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,460
did get a little bit of attention. Yeah, it did.

357
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,460
I think if I

358
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,460
showed this to my mum, she'd say,

359
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,460
that's nice, dear, and that

360
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,460
would be it. Yeah,

361
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,460
there's an element of that as well.

362
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,460
It didn't make a big connection to

363
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,460
the part Linux plays, really.

364
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,460
No. No, I guess you have to...

365
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,460
There's a huge amount that goes into providing the real-time

366
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,460
directions. You kind of have to infer that Linux would

367
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,460
be providing solutions for all those things

368
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,460
but if you don't know anything about Linux...

369
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,460
Debbie Downer and all that, but it just

370
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,460
seems like a complete waste of time.

371
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,460
The other

372
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,460
question that has to be asked is

373
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,460
is that being created under Linux?

374
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,460
Yeah, right, exactly. I don't think it is.

375
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,460
Was that contracted for a designer

376
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,460
using a Mac? Yeah.

377
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,460
I don't know, so I'm torn.

378
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,460
Part of me really likes them getting the word out, and

379
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,460
part of me likes the idea of sort of showing how Linux

380
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,460
has made our modern lives easier, but part of me

381
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,460
thinks it's a little off-tone

382
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,460
because you have to kind of know how Linux fills in

383
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,460
the gaps in order to get it in the first place, and if you know how

384
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,460
Linux fills in the gaps, it's not resonating with you.

385
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,460
And number two is... I probably think it was

386
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,460
probably made on a Mac.

387
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,460
My thoughts. Hey, you know what?

388
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,460
Speaking of things that are probably not made on Macs,

389
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,460
OggCamp 15 this weekend!

390
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,460
October 31st and

391
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,460
November 1st in Liverpool,

392
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,460
which is a little

393
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,460
bit of a commute from here. Just a little bit of a commute.

394
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,460
So I don't think I'll be making it, but I bet a few

395
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,460
folks in the... I've got a boat and everything. I know, I could.

396
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,460
Put the rover.

397
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,460
Yeah, just put the rover on a ferry and call it good.

398
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,460
Put some pontoons on it. What else

399
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,460
do I need? So anybody want to

400
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,460
chat about OggCamp and kind of tell us what to expect

401
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,460
if people are in the area? Maybe they could make it.

402
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,460
Go ahead. Yeah, so

403
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,460
this is, I don't know,

404
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,460
like the eighth, seventh one?

405
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,460
I've lost count.

406
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,460
And something like that.

407
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,460
And we do them every year.

408
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,460
They're community-run events.

409
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,460
It's an unconference,

410
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,460
and we've moved around the country a few times.

411
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,460
We've run them in Liverpool a few times because

412
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,460
one of the organisers lives near there,

413
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,460
and we've got a really great deal on a venue.

414
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,460
It's at Liverpool John Moores University.

415
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,460
31st of October,

416
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,460
1st of November, so that's this weekend as we're

417
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,460
recording.

418
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,460
And people come along. It's not necessarily

419
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,460
a Linux or open source

420
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,460
or FOSS conference.

421
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,460
It's free culture,

422
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,460
open hardware hacking.

423
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
There's some Linux people there.

424
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,460
I bet there's a fair amount of Linux people there.

425
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,460
Yeah, there is.

426
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,460
But it's not

427
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,460
distro-specific, so while

428
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,460
Ubuntu is one of the sponsors, Fedora

429
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,460
is another sponsor, and

430
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,460
Martin can tell you one of the other

431
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,460
sponsors in a minute.

432
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,460
Yeah, we have a bunch of sponsors who

433
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,460
help fund the event, but the key thing is it's free

434
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,460
to attend, so you can

435
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,460
buy a ticket if you want to,

436
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,460
if you want to pay and donate a little bit that

437
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,460
helps run the event,

438
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,460
or you can just have a ticket for free.

439
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,460
We don't differentiate.

440
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,460
That's a cool system.

441
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,460
But the thing is

442
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,460
most years, the years when we started

443
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,460
doing this community funded,

444
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,460
it turns out that the community

445
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,460
turned out to be one of the biggest

446
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,460
sponsors voluntarily.

447
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
So people just voluntarily

448
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,460
gave £5, £10, whatever they could,

449
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,460
and that was

450
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,460
comparable or higher than

451
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,460
the corporate sponsorships we got

452
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,460
from big name

453
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,460
brands, which I thought was really nice and really

454
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,460
shows off the way that the conference runs.

455
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,460
And if people want to come along, come along to

456
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,460
Liverpool John Moores University.

457
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,460
If you go to ogcamp.org,

458
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,460
you'll find out all the details, the schedule, and

459
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,460
if you've got something to talk about, bring that along

460
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,460
and do a long form talk

461
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,460
or we've got lightning talks as well.

462
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,460
Cool. That's exactly

463
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,460
the kind of event

464
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,460
that I think is really in that sweet spot. So that

465
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,460
sounds really cool. Ogcamp.org, and I'd love

466
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,460
it if you guys showed up and told us

467
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,460
a little about how it went next week. So Wimpy,

468
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,460
you had a little deets on one of the

469
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
potential sponsors here. Is this the one

470
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,460
listed here at the bottom of the page?

471
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,460
No, at the top of the page.

472
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,460
So Entroware, who

473
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,460
are the Platinum sponsor this year,

474
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,460
they are also

475
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,460
a hardware partner

476
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,460
for Ubuntu Mate. Right, right.

477
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,460
So Entroware

478
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,460
is sort of the UK's answer to

479
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,460
System76. So if you want a

480
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,460
computer that is designed

481
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,460
to run Linux, then

482
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,460
Entroware is the place that you go.

483
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,460
And at Ogcamp this year,

484
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,460
they're the Platinum sponsor, I think the only Platinum

485
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,460
sponsor. They're going to be

486
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,460
showing off their new Skylake

487
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,460
equipped systems

488
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,460
at the event. They've also

489
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,460
donated one of their

490
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,460
new as yet unreleased models

491
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,460
to the raffle. So there's a £600

492
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,460
laptop up for grabs

493
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,460
in the raffle, and

494
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,460
I can exclusively

495
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,460
reveal that Entroware are also

496
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,460
a Valve partner, and they will be

497
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,460
showing off their Steam Machine at

498
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,460
this year's Ogcamp, and so you can come along

499
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,460
and have a play with Entroware's

500
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,460
Steam Machine. So yeah. That's exciting.

501
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,460
And this is great

502
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,460
for me personally, because I know these

503
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,460
people via email

504
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,460
and Telegram and what have you, but I've

505
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,460
never met them in person, so this is an opportunity

506
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,460
for me to meet the

507
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,460
guys at Entroware for the first time.

508
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,460
So this is a perfect

509
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,460
example of what Entroware's all about. It's about

510
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,460
bringing people together from the

511
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,460
community to have a chat,

512
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,460
have a meal, and have

513
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,460
some fun, and do

514
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,460
good things. Really cool.

515
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,460
I'm glad that they're doing that. And

516
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,460
Ogcamp.org is

517
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,460
now, is there any chance at any

518
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,460
point that this thing would ever

519
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,460
be live streamed?

520
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,460
We've recorded

521
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,460
talks in

522
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,460
the past, and in fact we've

523
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,460
had some people record

524
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,460
talks and send them to us.

525
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,460
One notable one was

526
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,460
Stephen Fry,

527
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,460
who sent us a talk that we

528
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,460
played to the audience at

529
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,460
Ogcamp a few years ago, which

530
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,460
was really nice, and he talked about Software Freedom and

531
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,460
GNU and all that good stuff.

532
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,460
We tend to not live stream

533
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,460
because we just

534
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,460
don't have enough people and

535
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,460
infrastructure and stuff to do it.

536
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,460
You know what would be amazing? You know what would be an amazing goal?

537
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,460
It's probably impossible, but how cool would it be

538
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,460
for Ogcamp 16 if Jupyter Broadcasting could go

539
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,460
and we could live stream it for you?

540
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,460
That would be amazing.

541
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,460
Put that in the budget, Chris.

542
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,460
I just gotta take care of a few things.

543
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,460
I just would love to.

544
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,460
That's not a bad idea, actually.

545
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,460
It's a really great idea, and

546
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,460
I know of at least

547
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,460
half a dozen podcasters in the UK that

548
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,460
could help with your accommodation whilst you're out.

549
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,460
That would be fun. That would be a lot of fun.

550
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,460
Well, let's talk more. I think that'd be really cool.

551
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,460
Alright, so

552
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,460
Wimpy, while we're talking about Ubuntu Mate

553
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,460
too, guess what? As the part of the big release,

554
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,460
all the big 15.10 releases came out,

555
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,460
and the one that we follow really closely on

556
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,460
the show is Ubuntu Mate Edition.

557
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,460
15.10 is out, and

558
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,460
I like the press kit page that was put together,

559
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,460
and it looks like a ton of stuff.

560
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,460
Obviously, the really big feature is

561
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,460
Mate Desktop 1.10.

562
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,460
Also, the new...

563
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,460
I know that you worked really hard on the new welcome screen,

564
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,460
so, Wimpy, where do you want to start with some of

565
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,460
the new stuff that's in Ubuntu Mate, because it looks like

566
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,460
a killer release.

567
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,460
Well, I think so, but then I'm

568
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,460
biased, aren't I?

569
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,460
Well, I think... I mean, I'm telling you realistically,

570
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,460
I mean, one of the reasons people might

571
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,460
ask and wonder why do I follow it closely

572
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,460
on this podcast, why don't I follow Kubuntu

573
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,460
or Zubuntu,

574
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,460
which has been around for longer,

575
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,460
because, honestly, to me,

576
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,460
I feel like I've been watching a lot of different

577
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,460
flavors for a long time, a lot of different

578
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,460
distributions for a really, really long time,

579
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,460
and there is really some

580
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,460
great things you're doing here, so I think this is one

581
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,460
of the standouts, and so that's why I like to cover here

582
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,460
on the show.

583
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,460
I'm biased as well. I think it really is

584
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,460
a fantastic desktop for anybody that

585
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,460
wants to game under Linux

586
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,460
because the Mate desktop has very

587
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,460
low overhead, but you're getting a very high-quality,

588
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,460
very modern-looking desktop, or anybody that just

589
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,460
wants a very simple, straightforward desktop that

590
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,460
works the way they expect that has low resource

591
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,460
usage. But still looks really good. Yeah.

592
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,460
And it's friendly to use. It's very friendly to use.

593
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,460
So I'm biased as well.

594
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,460
Well, thank you very much for the kind words.

595
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,460
That's very gracious of you.

596
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,460
Yeah, so we've got the

597
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,460
Mate Desktop 1.10, and you

598
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,460
touched on the Steam stuff there.

599
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,460
So there's a couple of things

600
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,460
where the planets have aligned there.

601
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,460
I think

602
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,460
Foronix either today or yesterday

603
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,460
published an article about the different

604
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,460
desktop environments and their performance

605
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,460
with running games

606
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,460
under Linux. And Mate was up there

607
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,460
in the top couple

608
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,460
of desktops for sort of gaming

609
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,460
performance. It makes sense.

610
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,460
And then you marry that with

611
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,460
the Ubuntu 15.10 base,

612
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,460
which of course has got Steam

613
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,460
Controller support out of

614
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,460
the box. And then what

615
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,460
we've done with Ubuntu Mate

616
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,460
Welcome, which has got a one-click

617
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,460
installer for Steam.

618
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,460
And you have an environment

619
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,460
that can, with one

620
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,460
click, be your desktop

621
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,460
gaming environment. So

622
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,460
yeah, there's a few things that

623
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,460
come together in a very sort of last minute

624
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,460
timely fashion. But you know,

625
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,460
it's nice to see all of those

626
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,460
things being pulled together.

627
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,460
But I suppose Ubuntu Mate Welcome

628
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,460
is more than people

629
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,460
realize. I see people sort of

630
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,460
immediately hitting close because

631
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,460
these sort of welcome screens

632
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,460
traditionally have been a bit anemic.

633
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,460
You know, just a bunch of links

634
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,460
to websites and Ubuntu

635
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,460
Mate Welcome is not that.

636
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,460
It actually does things.

637
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,460
You know, it gives you some help

638
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,460
through the initial post

639
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,460
install configuration

640
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,460
and can install,

641
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,460
not right now, definitely for

642
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,460
16.04, but now

643
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,460
at least a good proportion of

644
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,460
the software you would want to install on a

645
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,460
computer. You know, if you've used a computer

646
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,460
regardless of operating system,

647
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,460
you're probably familiar with things

648
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,460
like Dropbox and Google Chrome

649
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,460
or Spider

650
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,460
Oak 1 or a whole heap of other things.

651
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,460
And Ubuntu Mate

652
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,460
Welcome's got one click installers for

653
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,460
all of those and many others besides.

654
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,460
And we'll expand on that

655
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,460
selection slightly, not

656
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,460
overly, maybe about

657
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,460
20 titles or so in the next

658
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,460
release just to sort of make that

659
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,460
the place you can go

660
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,460
once you've installed. And also it's asynchronous.

661
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,460
I don't think anyone's picked up

662
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,460
on this, but you can go down that

663
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,460
link, that list and hit install, install,

664
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,460
install, install. Oh, I love that. That's wonderful.

665
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,460
Thank you for that. So

666
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,460
is this also sort of

667
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,460
a...

668
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,460
Is this sort of an answer to

669
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,460
the software center that isn't a software

670
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,460
center? It isn't an app store. It's

671
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,460
almost something better because

672
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,460
it's actually more in line with

673
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,460
what users actually need.

674
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,460
Every single time I give someone a new Linux desktop

675
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,460
and it baffles

676
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,460
me to this day,

677
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,460
the hugest concept gap that they have

678
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,460
is how to acquire new software.

679
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,460
Definitely. Because in their minds, I gave

680
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,460
just this, just

681
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,460
Monday, I gave somebody a new Linux laptop

682
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,460
and his first thought was

683
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,460
he wanted to go download Scrivener for the writing month

684
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:51,460
that's coming up. Download,

685
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,460
he just went to Scrivener's website

686
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,460
and immediately started looking for a download link

687
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,460
and a download in exe. And it

688
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,460
just does not register

689
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,460
at all how it should be done. And I think

690
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,460
so an app store is actually too much.

691
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,460
It is overshoot.

692
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,460
They have

693
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,460
a category of applications they just

694
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,460
want to get up and running with pretty quickly

695
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,460
and then they pretty much never really go

696
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,460
back and change it again.

697
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,460
Most people, that's what they're doing. They're using the computer

698
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,460
to use these applications. That few functions, right?

699
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,460
If you nail it with the welcome screen,

700
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,460
you almost negate the

701
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,460
need to have a really well robust

702
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,460
app store. I mean, it doesn't

703
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,460
completely replace it, but for

704
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,460
a good decent chunk of users,

705
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,460
it negates the need as much.

706
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,460
Yeah, for a good chunk of people

707
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,460
it certainly fills a need.

708
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,460
And that's what it's designed to do.

709
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,460
So,

710
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,460
Matt Hartley actually helped with the

711
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,460
software selection in Ubuntu

712
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,460
Marte Welcome. So, he helped

713
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,460
identify the applications and

714
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,460
what they were alternative or equivalent

715
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,460
to. So, some of the apps you'll

716
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,460
find in there says this

717
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,460
is an alternative to. So, GIMP

718
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,460
says it's an alternative to Photoshop.

719
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,460
That's nice.

720
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,460
Say it's equivalent.

721
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,460
It's an alternative to. But we've done as

722
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,460
much as we can to these

723
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,460
applications to make them the best they

724
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,460
can be. So, in the example of GIMP,

725
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,460
it doesn't just install GIMP. It installs

726
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,460
GIMP and a series of

727
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,460
plugins including CMYK

728
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,460
support. Oh, that's very polished.

729
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,460
There's a little bit of tweaking that goes on

730
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,460
there. So, when you choose

731
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,460
to install Chromium. So, there's a little

732
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,460
tick box that says hide proprietary

733
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,460
software. If you're looking at the

734
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,460
internet section and you click that,

735
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,460
Chrome disappears and

736
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,460
Chromium appears in its place.

737
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,460
But when you install Chromium,

738
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,460
it installs Chromium

739
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,460
and all of the

740
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,460
supported multimedia extensions

741
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,460
for Chromium are available.

742
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,460
So, it does an awful lot behind the

743
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,460
scenes. It does a lot of the heavy lifting.

744
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,460
And, you know, it also brings some things

745
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,460
in that probably need a bit of promoting. So,

746
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,460
things like VeraCrypt which is now the

747
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,460
successor to TrueCrypt.

748
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,460
Now that TrueCrypt have been through its NCC

749
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,460
group, you know, validations

750
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,460
and they've signed it off and the guys

751
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,460
at VeraCrypt have really

752
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,460
improved the cryptography

753
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,460
and some of the

754
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,460
key generation in VeraCrypt.

755
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,460
I think that is

756
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,460
now a genuine

757
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,460
alternative to TrueCrypt. So, there's a one-click

758
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,460
installer, you know, for that. For those

759
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,460
people that have got TrueCrypt

760
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,460
volumes that really need to

761
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,460
stop using TrueCrypt now,

762
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,460
there's a solution for you to

763
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:29,460
import your TrueCrypt volume, bring it up

764
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,460
to date with the latest stuff.

765
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,460
Makes it nice and easy to move over.

766
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,460
Yeah, yeah. So,

767
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,460
it does a whole heap of things

768
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,460
and as you say, you know,

769
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,460
for most people this will...

770
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,460
So, I haven't

771
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,460
cooked this up, you know,

772
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,460
out of thin air. This is actually made

773
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,460
by talking to actual people

774
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,460
that use the distribution or

775
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,460
use other operating systems and trying

776
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,460
to understand what they need.

777
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,460
And it is more geared towards people

778
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,460
who just need a helping hand to get

779
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,460
started, but that

780
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,460
asynchronous technique

781
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,460
is also convenient for someone like

782
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,460
me who when I install a new machine,

783
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,460
I can just go down the list,

784
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,460
install, install, install, install, install,

785
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,460
walk away, make a cup of tea and come

786
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,460
back and all my stuff's installed.

787
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,460
So, this is...

788
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,460
I mean, that's just the welcome screen,

789
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,460
but there's also one of the things that you

790
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,460
I saw also updated was

791
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,460
MateTweak, which I think is

792
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,460
kind of maybe a nice point to underscore

793
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,460
because I don't know if people realize when

794
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,460
they install it, you can go in here and you can actually

795
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,460
turn on a whole bunch of more stuff and tweak

796
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,460
a whole bunch of stuff. So, not to stop the welcome

797
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,460
screen, but I also wanted you to touch on the tweak screen

798
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,460
or the new tweak app or the updates to the tweak app

799
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,460
too. Yeah. So,

800
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,460
MateTweak is

801
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,460
distribution agnostic.

802
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,460
I forked it from Mint Desktop.

803
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,460
So, it's a utility that

804
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,460
is shipped in Mint Desktop.

805
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,460
I forked it from there and then

806
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,460
stripped out all of the Mint

807
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,460
stuff and then made it

808
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,460
distribution agnostic. So,

809
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,460
it'll run on any distribution. So, it's

810
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,460
not pinned to Debian or Ubuntu.

811
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,460
It runs on Arch just fine and

812
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,460
some people stuck it in the AUR.

813
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,460
But this enables you to

814
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,460
one click

815
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,460
activate compiz, for example.

816
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,460
Right. So, just like

817
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,460
Ubuntu used to do back in the day,

818
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,460
you used to go into those extra options

819
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,460
and turn on

820
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,460
extra animations and

821
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,460
compiz would come on. There's a drop down to

822
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,460
enable compiz and it's also got

823
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,460
a facility to

824
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,460
somewhat

825
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,460
reproduce the look and feel of

826
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,460
other desktop environments

827
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,460
outside of the Linux world and within.

828
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,460
So, you've got a theme

829
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,460
called Redmond, which looks

830
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,460
much like Windows XP.

831
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,460
A theme called Cupertino,

832
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,460
which looks like Mac OS X.

833
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,460
And then

834
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,460
within there, I've

835
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,460
changed the layout slightly. I've improved

836
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,460
the way the UI works.

837
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,460
So, now there's the

838
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,460
enable indicators, which enables

839
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,460
the app indicator capabilities of

840
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,460
Ubuntu underneath the hood. Very nice.

841
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,460
If you want app indicator support, it's a tick box

842
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,460
away. Or the advanced menu.

843
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,460
The advanced menu again is

844
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,460
forked from the Mint utilities.

845
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,460
That's the Mint menu, which again

846
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,460
I've forked and made distribution

847
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,460
agnostic. So, this is

848
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,460
something you can install on any

849
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,460
distribution running Marte and

850
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,460
it gives you that Mint desktop

851
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,460
that I've sort of stripped out all of the bits

852
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,460
that are specific to Mint

853
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,460
and made it something that you can run

854
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,460
anywhere. And that's

855
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,460
those two utilities are sort of those

856
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,460
sort of value add

857
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,460
that give sort of Ubuntu Marte

858
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,460
some of its identity, you know,

859
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,460
that distinguish it from

860
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,460
the other distributions.

861
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,460
Right. Very much so.

862
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,460
And it makes me

863
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,460
wonder. The next thing that

864
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,460
comes to mind is why I'd love to have somebody

865
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,460
have all these things but not have to worry about them

866
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,460
upgrading their distro in nine months.

867
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,460
What is the likelihood that any of this stuff ever

868
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,460
makes it any further back down to sort of like

869
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,460
an LTS release? Is that even possible?

870
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,460
Well, definitely

871
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,460
it's going to be in 16.04.

872
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,460
So, going forward. All right. So, I

873
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,460
guess I'd have to wait. So, if somebody

874
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,460
today wanted to set up an LTS

875
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,460
laptop, they'd kind of have to either

876
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,460
kind of wait or go

877
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,460
with 15.10 and then update.

878
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,460
Well,

879
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,460
you've got a number of options. There is

880
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,460
an Ubuntu Marte 14.04 release

881
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,460
which is based on the

882
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,460
Ubuntu LTS release strategy.

883
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,460
Those two utilities

884
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,460
that you're looking at there have been

885
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,460
backported. So, Ubuntu Marte

886
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,460
Welcome and Marte Tweak have been

887
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,460
backported to 14.04.

888
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,460
So, if you want them, they're there.

889
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,460
Now, the thing is

890
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,460
I didn't

891
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,460
appreciate this at the time, but

892
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,460
the gap between

893
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,460
Ubuntu Marte 14.04

894
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,460
and 15.10 is

895
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,460
vast. So,

896
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,460
my advice is if you're

897
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,460
interested in trying out Ubuntu Marte

898
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,460
today, install

899
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,460
15.10 because

900
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,460
the best version

901
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,460
we've made, the most polished

902
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:09,460
version we've made,

903
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,460
and one of the other things we've worked

904
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,460
on in this release is that you can

905
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,460
distribution release

906
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,460
upgrade. So, I've upgraded

907
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,460
all of my machines that I was on

908
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,460
15.04 to

909
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,460
15.10 using the internal

910
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,460
upgrade. I worked with the Ubuntu

911
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,460
foundations team to make sure

912
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,460
that that stuff worked right. So,

913
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,460
if you install 15.10 today,

914
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,460
I will personally guarantee

915
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,460
you can upgrade to 16.04

916
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,460
in April.

917
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,460
Wow. Wimpy will fix it for you if it breaks.

918
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,460
Yeah, well, I mean, even if

919
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,460
you didn't mention that, I was just going to say it seems like a pretty

920
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,460
safe bet that since the gap between

921
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,460
15.10 and 16.04 is small,

922
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,460
it should be fine.

923
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,460
Yeah, it's one to one. You should be able to upgrade pretty safely.

924
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,460
So, it seems like this would be the one to jump in at.

925
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,460
But for me,

926
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:57,460
I've recently rediscovered

927
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,460
my love affair with Bluetooth.

928
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,460
So, something the Mate

929
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,460
team have been working on for a while

930
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,460
now is helping

931
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,460
the new maintainer of Blue

932
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,460
Man 2

933
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,460
to fruition.

934
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,460
That's great.

935
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,460
So, Blue Man 2 also features

936
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,460
in 15.10. And

937
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,460
Ubuntu Mate is not the only

938
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,460
flavor to take advantage of

939
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,460
Blue Man 2.

940
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,460
The underlying stack

941
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,460
has been upgraded as well to

942
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,460
Blue's 5.35

943
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,460
rather than an extremely old

944
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,460
version of Blue's 4. So,

945
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,460
consequently, I'm now able to

946
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,460
do Bluetooth

947
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,460
sharing

948
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,460
over network sharing

949
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,460
and connecting to

950
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,460
headsets and speakers and stuff.

951
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,460
Very recently, things I've become

952
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,460
more and more...

953
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,460
I've wanted more and more as I've sometimes

954
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,460
been in the rover without connectivity

955
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,460
and I just want to move a file from

956
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,460
my phone to the desktop. I just

957
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,460
want to move that file between these two devices and I

958
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,460
just have Bluetooth as my available option.

959
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,460
That should be easy. Yeah, that should be.

960
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,460
So, I know...

961
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,460
It also feels like we are now

962
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,460
really reaching the point where

963
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,460
14.04, even with its updates,

964
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,460
even the point updates, 14.04 is

965
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,460
beginning to feel very old.

966
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,460
And I...

967
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,460
You know, we have a machine here

968
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,460
in studio now that is dual

969
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,460
booting and one of the systems it's booting is Ubuntu

970
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,460
15.10. And I think I'm going

971
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,460
to stay there for a while and go

972
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,460
to 16.04 because I don't think I can go back.

973
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,460
Who's clicking there, Wes? Who is that?

974
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,460
Who's clickalickin'? Who's clickalackin'?

975
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,460
That's

976
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,460
Swift. All right, Swift.

977
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,460
Maybe Swift needs to move up to the

978
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,460
staging area for a minute. Sorry

979
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,460
about that. So, what I was

980
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,460
just saying is I

981
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,460
just very recently went through this debate as I was

982
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,460
setting up this machine here in the

983
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,460
studio thinking, well, I might as well just stay at 15.10 for a while.

984
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,460
Just hang out there. Yeah, check out there.

985
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,460
And then go to 16.04. That'd be better than this.

986
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,460
Generally, 15.10 is a really solid release.

987
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,460
Yeah, that was my experience in the review testing

988
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,460
that we did. There's an awful lot of

989
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,460
effort, but you know, behind the scenes, having

990
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,460
some involvement with some of the

991
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,460
people at Canonical now and

992
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,460
being able to see what goes on

993
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,460
sort of behind the scenes on a

994
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,460
day-to-day basis. Yeah.

995
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,460
To say that

996
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,460
whilst visually on

997
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,460
the surface, people might not appreciate it.

998
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,460
And you didn't get

999
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,460
grossed out. I'll give you

1000
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,460
an example. If you look

1001
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,460
at it on the surface, you might not

1002
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,460
think Ubuntu Software Center has

1003
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,460
changed, but I know it has.

1004
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,460
So, at the back end,

1005
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,460
Ubuntu Software Center has actually

1006
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,460
seen some

1007
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,460
bug fixing and improvements

1008
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,460
that you won't

1009
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,460
appreciate, you know, through

1010
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,460
the UI because the version

1011
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,460
number is the same, but if you go and look at

1012
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,460
the change logs, you can actually see that the

1013
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,460
Ubuntu Desktop team have been working on this.

1014
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,460
Well, that's a statement right there. I haven't heard one before.

1015
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,460
There's a whole heap of things like

1016
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,460
that that I've now got an insight to

1017
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,460
and an appreciation of.

1018
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,460
You know, that has been... I didn't previously

1019
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,460
have. That has been a universal

1020
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,460
experience of mine every time we've gone in

1021
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,460
and worked with any... a lot of these

1022
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,460
companies that work in this field is that there's

1023
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,460
a lot of work and things that get done

1024
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,460
that they are, A, just not

1025
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,460
very good at communicating because they don't

1026
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,460
have the time, they don't see the need, or the people who

1027
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,460
would be communicating don't see the need or aren't connected to the

1028
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,460
people making the change. Or there's legal reasons

1029
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,460
a lot of the times, too, that they can't say anything.

1030
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,460
Or, you know, there's thousands.

1031
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,460
But every time we go in there, it's like, wow, you guys

1032
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,460
are really working really hard, even though from the

1033
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,460
outside we don't see it all the time. It's universally

1034
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,460
really much been the case, and I'm

1035
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,460
usually very impressed.

1036
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,460
Speaking of impressed, very impressed

1037
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,460
by Ubuntu Mate 15.10, I think

1038
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,460
that's becoming the default recommendation.

1039
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,460
If somebody wants to

1040
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,460
try Linux, I think this is the

1041
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,460
go-to, especially if they're coming

1042
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,460
from a Windows or Mac

1043
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,460
desktop, even. Yeah, definitely.

1044
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,460
It's very approachable. Yeah. I mean, unless

1045
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,460
there's a specific reason they would need

1046
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,460
Gnome 3 or Unity, just to me seems

1047
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,460
if there's not a specific reason for that,

1048
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,460
because even on a brand new machine

1049
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,460
they're going to have a good performance. Yeah, definitely.

1050
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,460
And all the apps they could want.

1051
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,460
Personally, if

1052
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,460
Ubuntu Mate is the gateway

1053
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,460
drug for people to find Linux,

1054
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,460
I'd be perfectly happy to be

1055
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:15,460
that gateway distribution

1056
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,460
that people find Linux through.

1057
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,460
There you go. Very noble of you. Well said.

1058
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,460
If you use Ubuntu Mate

1059
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,460
and you like it, and then it whets

1060
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,460
your palate and you want to go on and find

1061
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,460
other stuff, then great.

1062
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,460
Job well done, I think, if that's

1063
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,460
the position we hold in

1064
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,460
the Ubuntu distro community.

1065
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,460
So if you give it a try,

1066
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,460
let us know. linuxactionshow.reddit.com

1067
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,460
and find episode 116.

1068
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,460
And I wanted to also give Symonk2

1069
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,460
a chance to mention about his

1070
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,460
excitement for 16.04.

1071
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,460
Go ahead.

1072
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,460
Yeah, I was actually, I think I'm actually

1073
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,460
really, really excited for 16.04

1074
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,460
because I don't know if, I think it was Tech Republic

1075
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,460
that posted an article, and I kind of agree

1076
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:57,460
with this, where

1077
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,460
16.04 is probably going to

1078
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,460
be a very exciting release, because

1079
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,460
well, specifically for Ubuntu

1080
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,460
Unity, because

1081
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,460
Unity 8 is going to come around the corner.

1082
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,460
I don't know if it's going to be 16.04 or what their

1083
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,460
plans are, but I think this

1084
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,460
it's going to start to pick up pace

1085
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,460
not only with Ubuntu

1086
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,460
Unity, but with other

1087
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,460
flavors.

1088
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,460
So I really think this will be

1089
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,460
one of the... We'll see.

1090
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,460
Or is 16.04 going to

1091
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,460
be relatively simple and straightforward

1092
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,460
but yet with some nice features, and

1093
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,460
16.10 is going to blow your freaking mind.

1094
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,460
Yeah, probably. Something around there

1095
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,460
or within the next couple of years

1096
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,460
I think it'll drastically change.

1097
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,460
Stay tuned and find out.

1098
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,460
I love it. Keep watching this show.

1099
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,460
Okay, so we have some

1100
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,460
we have a big win for Linux users to

1101
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,460
get into. We still have the Intel discussion to talk

1102
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,460
about. Also, we have to

1103
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,460
discuss this, you don't own your

1104
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,460
operating system, therefore it can be decrypted

1105
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,460
and the new Linux laptop

1106
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,460
and we have some emails to

1107
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,460
get into, so I'm going to take a second here. I'm going to tell you

1108
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,460
all about Linux Academy. Yeah, I

1109
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,460
don't want to talk to you about Linux Academy right now. Go to

1110
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,460
linuxacademy.com

1111
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,460
to get our special Linux Unplugged discount

1112
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,460
and then give a tour, if you will,

1113
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,460
of their different features. I think you'll be pretty impressed.

1114
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,460
It's Linux users that got together with

1115
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,460
developers and teachers to make something really great.

1116
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,460
And it's not... Oh, here's what I love

1117
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,460
about Linux Academy. It's not just an

1118
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,460
attempt at covering Linux and open source stuff.

1119
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,460
It is truly what they are passionate about.

1120
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,460
They have step-by-step video

1121
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,460
courses, comprehensive

1122
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,460
study guides, and the

1123
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,460
courses as well have come with instructor

1124
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,460
help, so you're not on your own necessarily.

1125
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,460
You can contact a real human being

1126
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,460
instructor and get help. There's a great community

1127
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,460
stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members.

1128
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,460
The courses come with their own lab servers.

1129
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,460
Seven plus Linux distributions you get to choose

1130
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,460
from because they get that there's different distros you might need

1131
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,460
to learn on. You can keep track of

1132
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,460
your progress as you go and they've been rolling out

1133
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,460
brand new features. Rather than just

1134
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,460
checking solutions, you'll now get instant feedback.

1135
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,460
So you don't have to just try something, submit it,

1136
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,460
and see how it does and get scored. You can get immediate

1137
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,460
feedback when performing exercises.

1138
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,460
And then you can know if you need to

1139
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,460
make a change and do it correctly.

1140
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,460
There's a new learning tool that's part of Linux Academy

1141
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,460
membership at no additional cost that really adds

1142
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,460
some nice functionality. Like they're applying this

1143
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,460
new tool to build performance-based practice exams

1144
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,460
for search, such as the

1145
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,460
RHCSA and the Linux Foundation

1146
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,460
search. Now those Red Hat certifications

1147
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,460
are a serious thing that people

1148
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,460
really get stressed out about.

1149
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,460
And spend a lot of time and effort trying to get.

1150
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,460
Yeah, so the fact that they're building this performance-based practice

1151
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,460
exam I think is really

1152
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,460
slick, really well done.

1153
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,460
And it's for finally for

1154
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,460
people that are Linux users that have certain

1155
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,460
high expectations of

1156
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,460
what is being taught to them

1157
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,460
and not just like this basic stuff that's coming from

1158
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,460
somebody who's just doing a professional

1159
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,460
read, but actually somebody who wrote

1160
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:45,460
sat down and wrote the material instructors that are familiar

1161
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,460
with it when you need help. Scenario-based

1162
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,460
labs, you actually work with this stuff in a

1163
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,460
production live environment.

1164
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,460
A real lab server where you can SSH into and do

1165
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,460
the actual work. I think it's

1166
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,460
really nice. And they also launched their professional

1167
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,460
development certification platform.

1168
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,460
It's a new set of tests that are very targeted

1169
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,460
and a lot different than professional certification.

1170
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,460
So there's a lot of new ways

1171
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,460
to challenge yourself. There's also tools

1172
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,460
available when you have limited availability that

1173
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,460
automatically adjust the courseware to match your

1174
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,460
availability. You combine that with the

1175
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,460
video streams. It's really pretty

1176
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,460
neat. And then, last but not least,

1177
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,460
you can deep dive into single topics with their nuggets.

1178
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,460
You go there two to sixty minutes long,

1179
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,460
learn something really simple, like

1180
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,460
how to use IP tables, how to use

1181
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,460
rsync, how to use Samba,

1182
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,460
how to set up Samba for this or that, just

1183
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,460
really specific topics. And it's really

1184
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,460
nice because they're all really quick or

1185
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,460
at least very specific. And I

1186
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,460
really think you should check out their lab systems.

1187
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,460
It's really cool. The fact that

1188
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,460
it comes with the lab is a nice feature

1189
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,460
too because if you're doing some of the AWS courses,

1190
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,460
you don't have to worry about setting up all that stuff.

1191
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,460
They'll take care of all of that for you as

1192
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,460
part of the integrated lab platform.

1193
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,460
It's really cool. No surprise, AWS

1194
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,460
builds. That's a big thing. Yeah, that has

1195
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,460
bit me. LinuxAcademy.com

1196
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,460
slash Unplugged. Go check them out. And a big

1197
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,460
thank you Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1198
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,460
You guys are rockin'.

1199
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,460
And that new October update is huge.

1200
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,460
Huge. If you sign up, you can go read more about

1201
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,460
it and go check out their community section

1202
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,460
as well. It's very nice.

1203
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,460
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged. Thanks

1204
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:13,460
Linux Academy. Alright, so

1205
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:15,460
BRTMR wrote into

1206
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,460
the show. He says, I was not satisfied

1207
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,460
with podcatchers for the command line, so I

1208
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,460
built my own. And it's called PodFox.

1209
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,460
Now, I don't know how, how do you catch your

1210
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,460
podcast right now, Wes? How do you catch your podcast?

1211
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,460
How many podcasts do you subscribe to, Wes?

1212
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,460
Oh, maybe on the order of

1213
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,460
ten. Okay, yeah,

1214
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,460
that's actually almost exactly where I'm at.

1215
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,460
How do you download them? Are you

1216
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,460
familiar with curl? Are you

1217
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,460
serious? Well, no, actually I use

1218
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,460
ARIA 2, but it is in the terminal.

1219
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,460
That's usually how it goes

1220
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,460
for me. Really? Yes. Okay, so this might

1221
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,460
be perfect for you. So PodFox is a podcatcher

1222
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,460
for the terminal. I'm loving this logo here.

1223
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,460
Yeah, that is good, right? That is good.

1224
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,460
It's a work in progress, but it

1225
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,460
has got a nice, simple directory structure.

1226
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,460
Every podcast is identified with

1227
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,460
its own short name. I think you were checking this

1228
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,460
out a little bit ago. What do you think about

1229
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,460
something like this? I mean,

1230
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,460
you're doing a dozen shows manually?

1231
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,460
That does sound crazy

1232
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,460
now that I think about it, but yeah, that's what I have

1233
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,460
been doing. Have you tried BashPod or two? I have

1234
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,460
not actually, no. Okay, okay. So maybe I should

1235
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,460
give PodFox a shot here. Wow. I mean, I like

1236
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,460
Python. It looks neatly implemented.

1237
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,460
I thought for sure your answer is going to be on your

1238
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,460
phone. Oh, yeah?

1239
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,460
Well, actually, no, I do it the reverse. I usually download it on my

1240
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,460
computer and stick it in my sync thing folder, and then it

1241
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,460
syncs to my phone. So tell me, IRC,

1242
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,460
how do you, IRC room, what do you

1243
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,460
use? Like, what's the app name or the tool you

1244
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,460
use to download your podcast? And then Mumble Room,

1245
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,460
I'm curious, is anybody in the

1246
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,460
Mumble Room also using the command line right now

1247
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,460
to download your podcast?

1248
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,460
Stay with me, brothers. You used

1249
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,460
to, Poppy? What do you use? Okay, how did you

1250
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,460
do what you use now? There was a tool called

1251
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,460
HPodder. Oh, yes.

1252
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,460
HPodder was good. It was written in Haskell,

1253
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,460
I think, which is why it's called HPodder. I used

1254
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,460
to use that, but now, actually,

1255
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,460
I have an iPad

1256
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,460
1 that is pretty much useless

1257
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,460
for anything because no apps

1258
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,460
work on it anymore and there's no software updates.

1259
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,460
So I just have it sat there with the Apple

1260
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,460
podcast app running, and

1261
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,460
it downloads my podcast from iTunes, and I sit

1262
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,460
and listen, and that's the only thing it

1263
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,460
does. I guess it has a decent enough

1264
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,460
speaker, too, right? Yeah, exactly.

1265
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:15,460
That's not too bad. Yeah, okay, so

1266
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,460
sort of a mobile setup there.

1267
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,460
Do you see they have a TechSnap as one of the example

1268
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,460
URLs here? No, I didn't see that. Are you serious?

1269
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,460
It looks like it. That's really funny.

1270
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,460
Where do I go to see that? Go down to

1271
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,460
import and then, yeah, you're right,

1272
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,460
the TechSnap MP3 feed. I love them already.

1273
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,460
Well, I'm glad I came across them. That's just

1274
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,460
funny. No, I was just checking this out.

1275
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,460
Oh, well, he did submit it to the Linux Action Show

1276
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,460
subreddit, so that makes sense. That makes sense. That does make sense.

1277
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:39,460
The TechSnap MP3

1278
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,460
feed, that's a popular

1279
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,460
feed. Yeah, that's some great stuff there. That's a good

1280
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,460
commuter show, I gotta say. If you haven't listened to the TechSnap

1281
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,460
show, you throw that, I mean, you could look at Alan

1282
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,460
Jude's face if you want, but... See, for me, it's his

1283
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,460
voice. It keeps me calm when you're sitting in traffic.

1284
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,460
Right? Especially when he's talking about

1285
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,460
ZFS. Yep. Which is a lot.

1286
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,460
Alright, so

1287
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,460
anyways, moving on.

1288
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,460
So, okay, YouTube, I'm seeing

1289
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,460
YouTube DL.

1290
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,460
What are podcasts as looks for me? Somebody kick him

1291
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,460
out of here. Rekai says he streams

1292
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,460
all on YouTube, BeyondPod on

1293
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:11,460
Android. Hmm.

1294
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,460
Anybody else in the mumble room have a shout out for

1295
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,460
the podcatching software they use?

1296
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,460
Pocketcasts.

1297
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,460
Yeah, Pocketcasts is one of my favorites.

1298
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,460
I totally agree. Oh, yeah, Wimpy, that's what you

1299
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,460
use for the 20

1300
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:25,460
podcasts you subscribe to.

1301
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,460
Yep, Pocketcasts, and occasionally

1302
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,460
I send those via Chromecast,

1303
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,460
but almost exclusively through

1304
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:33,460
Pocketcasts. Yeah, and on the

1305
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,460
internet phones, the

1306
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,460
Overcast from the Marco Arment is

1307
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,460
really good. It's free now. And

1308
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,460
one of the nice things, this is,

1309
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,460
if you get a, and Pocketcast does this too,

1310
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,460
if you get a podcast player

1311
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,460
for your phone, it's really nice to have it sync

1312
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,460
with a web player. Oh, yeah. Because when I,

1313
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,460
if I've been driving and the podcast gets

1314
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,460
really interesting and I park, I often times

1315
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,460
want to go in and finish it on my computer speakers,

1316
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,460
which are usually pretty nice, and listen to the podcast

1317
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,460
there. So to have the podcast

1318
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,460
mobile app sync with the web app is

1319
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,460
really nice. Oh, that sounds like a feature I would like.

1320
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,460
Yeah, it is. So you should check out Pocketcasts.

1321
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,460
Or Overcast if you want to get

1322
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,460
an internet phone. Yeah,

1323
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,460
so there you go.

1324
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,460
Apparently we woke up Alan.

1325
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,460
Now Alan's in the chat room. Sorry, Alan, we love

1326
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,460
you. Everybody say TechSnap is

1327
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,460
awesome. And

1328
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:21,460
CFS Rock's in the chat room. All right,

1329
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,460
so you can go check it out. So moving on

1330
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,460
from there, Wes, you caught

1331
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,460
this one today. This came out today

1332
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,460
as we're recording. It is a

1333
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,460
release or a media alert.

1334
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,460
Media alert, media alert.

1335
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,460
Hold on, we should do this legit style.

1336
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,460
Do you want to do this legit style? Let's do it. All right, here we go.

1337
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,460
It's a media alert, everybody.

1338
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,460
All right, from the Electronic Frontier Foundation,

1339
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,460
a media alert is coming in here

1340
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,460
that is actually a pretty big deal.

1341
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:53,460
It's actually good news.

1342
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,460
I started the day with bad news because CISA

1343
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,460
is raging through the US right now.

1344
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:59,460
And net neutrality just got a piss in the

1345
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,460
EU. So I was like, I was just nothing

1346
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,460
but bad news this morning. But today

1347
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,460
the EFF made a post that says

1348
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,460
the Librarian of Congress has granted security

1349
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,460
researchers and others the right to inspect

1350
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,460
and modify the software

1351
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,460
in their cars and other vehicles

1352
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,460
despite protests from vehicle manufacturers.

1353
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,460
They would protest. Well, this has

1354
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,460
become a big deal that we've

1355
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,460
those of us who

1356
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,460
have grumbled about the proprietary software

1357
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,460
in our cars have been talking about for a while

1358
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,460
but really came to light with the Volkswagen

1359
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:29,460
stuff.

1360
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,460
So the fact that this Volkswagen

1361
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,460
scandal with the cover-ups

1362
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:35,460
is really sort of

1363
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,460
forced this issue through, I think.

1364
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,460
And this is a big, big win for

1365
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:41,460
the end user. They say this

1366
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,460
access control rule is supposed to...

1367
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,460
This is what the manufacturers were using

1368
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,460
to block access. They say this

1369
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:49,460
access control rule is supposed to protect

1370
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,460
against harmful and unlawful copying.

1371
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,460
So the EFF staff attorney.

1372
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,460
But as we've seen in recent Volkswagen scandal

1373
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,460
where VW was caught manipulating some tests

1374
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,460
it can be used instead to hide wrongdoing

1375
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,460
hidden in computer code.

1376
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,460
The EFF also won an exemption

1377
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,460
for users who want to play video games

1378
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,460
after the publisher cuts off support.

1379
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,460
Yeah. For example

1380
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,460
some players may

1381
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,460
need to modify an old video game so it

1382
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,460
doesn't... They say... Yeah, some players

1383
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,460
may need to modify... Oh yeah, because this is where you're not

1384
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,460
getting in trouble for now. Some players may need to modify

1385
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,460
an old video game so it doesn't perform a

1386
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,460
check with the authentication server that has

1387
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,460
been shut down. The librarian also

1388
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,460
granted the EFF's petition to renew previous

1389
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,460
exemption to jailbreak smartphones

1390
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,460
and extend that to other mobile devices including

1391
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,460
tablets and

1392
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,460
smart watches. It's really upsetting

1393
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,460
to me that we have to get this as an exception

1394
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:39,460
that's occasionally granted by the Librarian

1395
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,460
of Congress, but I'm still very glad that it's

1396
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,460
continuing to be the case. It's like a subtle

1397
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,460
win for digital ownership

1398
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,460
that we kind of subscribe to. Yeah,

1399
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,460
it's like a continued win of something

1400
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,460
we should already just have. Yes, exactly. That should be

1401
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,460
enshrined and we shouldn't have to get it renewed every

1402
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,460
so often. But, thank you EFF.

1403
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,460
Yeah, I guess they...

1404
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,460
I mean, what this really is, is it's

1405
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,460
sort of... It's sort of

1406
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,460
working around the rules that the

1407
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,460
proprietary software vendors try

1408
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,460
to put in there, which we are going to be talking more about

1409
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,460
in a moment, so let's not go

1410
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,460
too far down there. While we're in

1411
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,460
the things that Wes came across that

1412
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,460
made us scratch our head this week category, because I think

1413
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,460
you also sent this in this morning

1414
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,460
when we were chatting.

1415
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,460
This is a real interesting

1416
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,460
piece on the invisiblethings.org

1417
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,460
blog, which is

1418
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:27,460
also where you would find

1419
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,460
Kube's OS.

1420
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,460
And I...

1421
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,460
I'm just going to read it to you, and then we'll

1422
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:35,460
see what to make of it. So, today I'm really seeing

1423
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,460
this first paper. Finally, you can see the PDF or

1424
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,460
EPUB here. As mentioned, this paper

1425
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,460
is mostly a survey of the various problems

1426
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,460
and attacks presented against the x86

1427
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,460
platform over the last

1428
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,460
10 years. And,

1429
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,460
uh, boy is

1430
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,460
it. It is, uh,

1431
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,460
it is, it is basically

1432
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,460
a, uh, it is a

1433
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,460
litany list of issues with x86

1434
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,460
that basically, to me, look like it

1435
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,460
condemned the platform, because there's so many

1436
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,460
different vulnerabilities built in.

1437
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,460
So, they start with the BIOS, the root

1438
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,460
trust of everything, bad SSMs,

1439
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,460
then they go on and talk about

1440
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,460
UEFI, they talk about some of the stuff

1441
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,460
Intel's built in for management, and then

1442
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,460
from there it's networking devices, of course

1443
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,460
USB devices, the graphics subsystem,

1444
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,460
disk controllers, audio cards, microphone speakers,

1445
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:21,460
cameras, embedded controllers, Intel management engines.

1446
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,460
The bottom line is

1447
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,460
specifically Intel x86

1448
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,460
based machines

1449
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,460
are just extremely, extremely

1450
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,460
vulnerable. No ways about it.

1451
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,460
Is that essentially what you got from it, too? Yes.

1452
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,460
I mean, I think a lot of what they're talking about as well is just the

1453
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,460
amount, you know, the instruction architecture

1454
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,460
is not necessarily bad. I mean,

1455
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,460
it might be old and crufty now. People have different

1456
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,460
opinions on that, but the amount of

1457
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,460
microcode and other things that runs without

1458
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,460
the running operating systems knowledge

1459
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,460
or intervention in any way has

1460
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,460
made it so that efforts, you know,

1461
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,460
from the open source community to make

1462
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,460
secure kernels that are running on

1463
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,460
verified hardware,

1464
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,460
you can never trust it now. It's similar to what we see

1465
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,460
in cell phones. Yeah, it's very

1466
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,460
much like that baseband that has its own...

1467
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,460
They can reach right into memory and, you know,

1468
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:07,460
stops the regular processor in its tracks.

1469
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:09,460
So, let's just...

1470
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,460
We'll just roll with the theory here that

1471
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,460
x86 is a very vulnerable platform.

1472
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,460
You know who I wouldn't want to necessarily

1473
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,460
be right now?

1474
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,460
I wouldn't want to be Windows. That's because they're

1475
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,460
really, really tied to this. I feel like

1476
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:23,460
this is something that Linux is going to be much better

1477
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:25,460
at rolling with if... I don't know what we'd roll

1478
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,460
to, but let's just, you know, we're just going with this

1479
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,460
theory here. If this is really a big deal,

1480
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,460
it seems like this

1481
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,460
would be something much quicker for Linux

1482
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,460
to respond to than it would be for Windows

1483
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,460
or Apple to respond to. Right. Assuming that, you know, we could

1484
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,460
get the headwind to change major

1485
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,460
architecture that is used by, you know,

1486
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,460
the computing public. Yeah. I think you're right.

1487
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,460
Yeah. What do you think, Wimpy? Is it possible?

1488
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,460
Is it all in the hands of the

1489
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,460
distros or could it just be a...

1490
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,460
Maybe like... Maybe one big distro

1491
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,460
comes out and says, all right, we're releasing for

1492
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,460
this laptop and they, you know, who knows how it could

1493
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,460
happen? There could be... There could be... There could be

1494
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,460
something there, but what are your thoughts?

1495
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,460
Well, all the big

1496
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,460
distributions are making their

1497
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,460
platforms available

1498
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,460
for other architectures.

1499
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,460
But when you look at Distro Watch,

1500
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,460
there's 800 some

1501
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,460
Linux distributions almost

1502
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,460
exclusively aimed at, you know,

1503
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,460
PC, the Intel chipset.

1504
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,460
Of those, there's

1505
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,460
about 20 or so that are

1506
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,460
aimed at ARM platforms.

1507
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,460
And

1508
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,460
if you're a distribution maintainer,

1509
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,460
it's very difficult for you

1510
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,460
to differentiate yourself

1511
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,460
from everybody else if you've got eight other

1512
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,460
distributions to,

1513
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,460
you know, compete against in

1514
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,460
air quotes. But

1515
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,460
if there's only 20

1516
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,460
distributions on ARM,

1517
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,460
for example, or

1518
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,460
half that on PowerPC, and

1519
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:49,460
PowerPC is still a thing. You know, people

1520
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,460
think of the old PowerPC on the G4s,

1521
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,460
but you can buy,

1522
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,460
you know, new PowerPC

1523
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,460
based equipment. You know, there's

1524
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,460
the Amiga 1,

1525
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,460
X1000, X5000, and

1526
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:03,460
X500 devices.

1527
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,460
Then, you know, if you're

1528
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,460
building for those architectures, then

1529
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,460
you're also, you know, just

1530
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,460
hedging your bets for the future because

1531
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,460
the trend is ARM

1532
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,460
is becoming the consumer

1533
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,460
chip platform.

1534
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:19,460
And, you know, you

1535
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,460
still want a foot in the Intel

1536
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,460
camp for serious gaming and

1537
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,460
professional workstations. You can't

1538
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:27,460
ignore that. And obviously, at the moment,

1539
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,460
despite the energy efficiency

1540
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,460
of ARM, you want Intel in the data

1541
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,460
center. But

1542
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,460
you, as a distribution

1543
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,460
maintainer, you can't not

1544
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,460
be looking at those

1545
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:41,460
alternate architectures.

1546
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,460
I do agree to an extent.

1547
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,460
It's an interesting, so it's an interesting

1548
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:49,460
thought that you put forward is that ARM is going to

1549
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,460
become the consumer platform. And

1550
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,460
kind of the concession that you're making there

1551
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,460
when you say that is

1552
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,460
consumers don't need a lot of CPU

1553
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,460
power.

1554
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,460
Well, they need some hardware acceleration

1555
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,460
for things for

1556
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,460
media consumption. And

1557
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,460
they need some degree

1558
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,460
3D performance for casual gaming.

1559
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,460
And it's only when

1560
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,460
you're into the serious gaming

1561
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,460
arena and professional work

1562
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,460
stations that you actually need to

1563
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,460
step out of the ARM arena where

1564
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,460
that isn't yet.

1565
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,460
And it could well be. I mean, I think it will.

1566
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:25,460
I mean, I think you look at some of the latest generation of

1567
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,460
CPUs and GPUs coming out for ARM.

1568
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:29,460
I have to say, I think most

1569
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,460
of the ARM stuff is driven by economy

1570
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,460
at the moment rather than technology.

1571
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,460
And I think ARM is far more capable

1572
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,460
than

1573
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,460
people are paying for. So I think

1574
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:41,460
it could well be the next

1575
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,460
platform. I really do

1576
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,460
think it's a contender.

1577
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,460
But we should be

1578
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:49,460
gearing up our distributions

1579
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,460
to support these

1580
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,460
platforms. So just

1581
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,460
thinking, you know, if you're being myopic

1582
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,460
and saying, oh, well, I'm laser focused

1583
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,460
on

1584
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,460
Intel 64-bit.

1585
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:03,460
Well, I tell

1586
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,460
you what, you're missing a trick there.

1587
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,460
There's what is it that I think

1588
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,460
in February, the Raspberry Pi

1589
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,460
Foundation said they'd sold

1590
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,460
5 million Raspberry Pis in

1591
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,460
two years. You know, if you

1592
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,460
extrapolate the numbers out, they must be

1593
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,460
clearing and approaching

1594
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,460
7 million by now.

1595
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,460
Right now, there are

1596
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,460
two Linux

1597
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:27,460
desktop operating systems, soon

1598
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,460
to be a third in the guise of

1599
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,460
Lubuntu, desktop operating

1600
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,460
systems available for the Raspberry Pi

1601
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,460
2. So

1602
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,460
do you want to be

1603
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,460
competing against 800

1604
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,460
distributions on Intel or do

1605
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:43,460
you want to be one of the three

1606
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,460
with 7 million devices?

1607
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,460
Yeah,

1608
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,460
you need to be

1609
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,460
gearing up to, and

1610
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,460
like I say, PowerPC isn't dead.

1611
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,460
PowerPC is massive in the data center.

1612
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,460
This is what's driving these

1613
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,460
new IBM

1614
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,460
mainframes.

1615
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,460
Yeah, that actually all rings

1616
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,460
pretty true. Let's be clear, they're not PowerPC, they're Power.

1617
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,460
Well, it's, yeah,

1618
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,460
the architecture. The Power architecture, yeah.

1619
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,460
Yes, the linearity, yeah.

1620
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,460
And also, there's still a pretty healthy...

1621
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:15,460
It has very similar problems to the x86.

1622
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:17,460
There's still also, I mean,

1623
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,460
a crap ton of literally PowerPC

1624
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,460
desktop machines on eBay. There's still

1625
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:23,460
a crap ton of those things getting sold.

1626
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,460
So, and I don't know

1627
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,460
if we could really walk away from this conversation without admitting

1628
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:29,460
that ARM probably is riddled with its own issues, too.

1629
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,460
It's not like ARM is some sort of savior platform that

1630
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,460
doesn't have security vulnerabilities, and not to mention

1631
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,460
it's always going to come down to implementation.

1632
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,460
And you have to trust whoever's manufacturing

1633
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:39,460
them anyway. Right, yeah. And when you have physical

1634
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,460
access to a device, it doesn't

1635
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,460
matter what the CPU architecture is, there's

1636
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,460
going to be vulnerabilities. Because all

1637
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,460
these ARM chips, all these ARM systems also

1638
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,460
have USB buses, so is there

1639
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:51,460
the same vulnerability there? But

1640
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,460
I think all the underlying points that

1641
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,460
Wimpy just made, and the point that I'm trying to make, too,

1642
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,460
is that Linux

1643
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,460
is specifically at a

1644
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,460
just technical advantage to roll with this.

1645
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,460
I think Wimpy underscores a good point, though, that

1646
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,460
really just out of the box, good to go

1647
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,460
consumer-focused distros that anybody

1648
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,460
could use, we're really lacking

1649
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,460
that right now. And I hadn't

1650
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,460
really thought about it, because when I think about it, I think

1651
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:15,460
of Raspbian, and I think

1652
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,460
of Arch, and that's what I run on the Raspberry

1653
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,460
Pi's. I don't really think about it.

1654
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,460
And unless

1655
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,460
you're up to speed with Arch, you've

1656
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,460
got to augment that into a desktop

1657
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,460
distribution right now. You've

1658
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,460
got Raspbian,

1659
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,460
Ubuntu, Mate, and

1660
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,460
soon, Lubuntu.

1661
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:35,460
And then you've got things like

1662
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,460
RISCOS, and you've got other distributions. There are other

1663
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,460
distributions out there, but they're not desktop

1664
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,460
focused, end user

1665
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,460
focused. And whilst the Raspberry Pi 2

1666
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,460
is just about capable

1667
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,460
of being a desktop replacement,

1668
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,460
it's not about

1669
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,460
what's there now. For example,

1670
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,460
Odroid, if you buy

1671
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,460
an Odroid and an eMMC

1672
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:57,460
chip with

1673
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,460
Ubuntu pre-installed as your

1674
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,460
Linux distribution rather than Android,

1675
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,460
when you plug that in and boot

1676
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,460
it, it's Ubuntu

1677
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:07,460
with the Mate desktop. Now, it's not

1678
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,460
Ubuntu-Mate, but it is Ubuntu

1679
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,460
and the Mate desktop.

1680
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,460
And they've got

1681
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,460
the fortunate position that

1682
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:17,460
their GPU has also got open

1683
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,460
source drivers, so you've got all of that

1684
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,460
3D stuff all accelerated out

1685
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,460
of the box. And Raspberry Pi

1686
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,460
is very, very close to

1687
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,460
delivering their

1688
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:29,460
accelerated drivers

1689
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,460
for X. So I think

1690
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,460
Linux 4.4 is targeted

1691
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:35,460
for the initial version that doesn't have

1692
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:37,460
all of the 3D acceleration yet, but

1693
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:39,460
it's coming. So

1694
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:41,460
this is why I've ported every

1695
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,460
Ubuntu flavor to the Raspberry Pi 2,

1696
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,460
because when that driver

1697
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:47,460
is available, every Ubuntu

1698
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,460
version is ready to go.

1699
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,460
I agree

1700
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,460
with you. When the horsepower gets there,

1701
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,460
I think you could see there's

1702
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,460
machines here in the studio I could even see replacing

1703
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,460
to a certain degree. And it seems like

1704
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:01,460
we're only on the start of that. The desktop

1705
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,460
computer revolution really

1706
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:05,460
gave Intel the funds to

1707
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:07,460
work on their fabrication technique. That's true.

1708
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,460
That's what we're going to see now in the ARM fabs.

1709
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,460
Yeah, and the phones are definitely, they're really adding a lot of

1710
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,460
fuel to that development fire. Apple pays all that money

1711
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,460
to get those A9s manufactured.

1712
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,460
That investment gets pushed up. And Samsung

1713
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,460
is building a lot of those, so that's

1714
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,460
not all lost. Even when they're building the Apple chips,

1715
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,460
they can't all be lost R&D.

1716
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,460
They have that machinery, right?

1717
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,460
I don't know. They learn from this.

1718
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,460
Right, exactly. And so

1719
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,460
I would say for me, it's

1720
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:33,460
nowhere near ready.

1721
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,460
I mean like, I

1722
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,460
yeah, I mean I just can't even

1723
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,460
see it for years for me. But I could see

1724
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:41,460
it for my kids already.

1725
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,460
And I could see it for

1726
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:45,460
a lot of people in a lot of different

1727
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,460
work roles very soon if not already.

1728
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,460
So it's very cool.

1729
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,460
Alright, so I want to move on from this.

1730
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,460
And I want to discuss this EULA situation

1731
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,460
that is

1732
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,460
very uncomfortable because it's a bad, bad precedent.

1733
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,460
And I think it's one that

1734
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:01,460
might be a good talking point for us that are discussing

1735
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:03,460
with users. Why would you want to maybe use

1736
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,460
Linux over Windows 10?

1737
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:07,460
Why would you want to maybe use

1738
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:09,460
the Ubuntu phone over Android?

1739
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:11,460
Or something like that. Well, this might

1740
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,460
be the number one talking point from here on out

1741
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:15,460
I would think. But first,

1742
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,460
I want to tell you about our friends at Digital Ocean.

1743
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:19,460
That's where I have my servers.

1744
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,460
Back in the day, before Digital Ocean,

1745
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,460
I was all about

1746
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,460
Proxmox.

1747
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,460
I was all about Proxmox. If I needed a server,

1748
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:29,460
I'd spin up a Proxmox VM. Have you ever

1749
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,460
messed with Proxmox? Only a little bit.

1750
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,460
Yeah. But I've heard some good things. And you probably mess with

1751
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,460
VirtualBox. Oh yeah, definitely.

1752
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,460
That's so, you know, like, okay, so what would I

1753
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:39,460
I would go get like my best Core i7 PC

1754
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:41,460
and I'd put a bunch of RAM in it

1755
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:43,460
and a bunch of hard drives in it of various

1756
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,460
quality. And I would put that in my garage

1757
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,460
and that would be how I would do my virtualization.

1758
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,460
Frankenstein monster virtualizer.

1759
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:51,460
Yeah, and that worked for basically always about

1760
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,460
a year before for some reason it completely

1761
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,460
blew up. And now

1762
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,460
now I'm like big time. Now I'm

1763
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:59,460
like, I walk in, I'm like a boss. I'm like, yeah, I have

1764
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,460
infrastructure in the cloud. I have data

1765
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,460
centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore,

1766
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,460
Amsterdam, London,

1767
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,460
Germany, and I just got an API.

1768
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,460
Got a new one up in Toronto. Yeah, I got it. It's straightforward

1769
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,460
that API.

1770
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,460
You know, and one click deployment of

1771
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,460
things like GitLab,

1772
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,460
Docker, one of the first

1773
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,460
to deploy Docker. Wow, Chris.

1774
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:21,460
My data center is, my data center

1775
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:23,460
is Digital Ocean. Yeah, I know. It's

1776
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,460
a big surprise. Digital Ocean, if you use the promo

1777
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:27,460
code DOUNPLUGGED, you can get a $10 credit

1778
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,460
and you can try out Digital Ocean two months

1779
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,460
for free. The $5 rigs,

1780
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,460
Wes, I'm telling you, I think just about every

1781
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,460
time you come in here, you sit

1782
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,460
down and log into a droplet in some form or another.

1783
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:39,460
Yeah, that's pretty much true. Is that Quazl core

1784
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:41,460
there running off of it? It sure is.

1785
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,460
Yeah, I got my Quazl core running off of Digital Ocean

1786
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:45,460
Droplet too. Seriously, if you use IRC

1787
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,460
for work or for communications,

1788
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:49,460
you should be looking at Quazl and Quazl core

1789
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:51,460
and put Quazl core on Digital Ocean Droplet.

1790
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:53,460
Worth $5 right there. Oh yeah, and it's

1791
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,460
real easy to get set up. It is. It just

1792
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,460
always runs. It's just right there for you. Trust me.

1793
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,460
It makes, you know,

1794
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:01,460
what you'll do if you do that is you'll be

1795
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:03,460
like, why did we ever use anything

1796
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,460
but IRC? Why is Twitter a thing?

1797
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,460
Why is Slack a thing?

1798
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:09,460
Why are we even using email?

1799
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:11,460
Really, why are we not using IRC for

1800
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:13,460
all the things? Anyways, there's

1801
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,460
a lot of different things like sync thing, own cloud,

1802
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:17,460
like I mentioned earlier, GitLab,

1803
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:19,460
BitTorrent sync. We do a big

1804
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,460
distribution for BitTorrent sync for our

1805
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,460
own filter show. Lots of people sync from

1806
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:25,460
that. All powered by Digital Ocean Droplets.

1807
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:27,460
It's really a cool system. And one of the

1808
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:29,460
really nice things if you need like a backend storage

1809
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:31,460
rig, there is some really cool solutions

1810
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:33,460
when you use private networking with Digital Ocean.

1811
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:35,460
The data sent between machines on the

1812
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,460
private networking doesn't go against your transfer. Even though

1813
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,460
you get a terabyte of transfer, you can use private

1814
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:41,460
network and do like backend caching,

1815
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,460
proxying, or a backend file server.

1816
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,460
And they have a really good interface to manage all of this.

1817
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,460
So for $5 a month, you can get 512

1818
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,460
megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD,

1819
01:02:49,460 --> 01:02:51,460
one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

1820
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,460
Digital Ocean is nuts, son. They're crazy.

1821
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:55,460
I want you to go check them out. And they now also

1822
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:57,460
have floating IPs.

1823
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:59,460
So that way when you go big,

1824
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,460
when you're like, when you're Ubuntu Mate

1825
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:03,460
and you're like, you're going big, you know,

1826
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:05,460
or you want to be

1827
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:07,460
fancy and you want to have a big launch day, they got

1828
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,460
floating IPs.

1829
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,460
You can scale out however you need. Just move it around.

1830
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:13,460
It floats. It floats.

1831
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,460
That's fancy. You know what? Things in the cloud float.

1832
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,460
Yeah. What I like about Digital Ocean

1833
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,460
too, it's all running on top of Linux. They use KVM

1834
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,460
as the virtualization platform,

1835
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:23,460
which some other providers out there that you

1836
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,460
may have heard of before are kind of kicking themselves for.

1837
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:27,460
No kidding. They're kind of like, I wish I would have gone KVM.

1838
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,460
The best thing about KVM, you get that, you get your

1839
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,460
own kernel right there, you know? You get

1840
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:33,460
all the new fancy kernel features. You want cgroups,

1841
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:35,460
you want IP tables, like whatever you want.

1842
01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:37,460
It's right there. And that means they're able to

1843
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:39,460
roll out the newer distros way before

1844
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:41,460
other guys do, which is really cool.

1845
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,460
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUG

1846
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:45,460
to support the show and get a $10 credit

1847
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,460
and a big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

1848
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,460
Linux Unplugged. You guys rock.

1849
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:51,460
Alright, so just let's talk about

1850
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,460
this from a general Linux perspective.

1851
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,460
The DOJ dismisses Apple's argument

1852
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,460
against encrypting iOS. And to Apple's

1853
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:59,460
credit, they have been fighting this

1854
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,460
case trying to say that

1855
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:03,460
they, you know, it'll do them harm

1856
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:05,460
if they have to unlock it. They say they can't unlock

1857
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,460
anything iOS 8 or above.

1858
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:09,460
However,

1859
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:11,460
the federal court is not agreeing.

1860
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:13,460
The US government rejected Apple's argument in federal court

1861
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:15,460
that unlocking iOS devices for police

1862
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,460
would damage the tech giant's public image

1863
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,460
because they've done it before.

1864
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:21,460
Boom. Apple designed, manufactured,

1865
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:23,460
and sold the phone that is subject to the search warrant,

1866
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,460
the government told US magistrate

1867
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:27,460
Judge James. But this is only

1868
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:29,460
the beginning of Apple's relationship to the phone

1869
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,460
and this matter. Apple owns

1870
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:33,460
the software and runs the phone, their argument

1871
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:35,460
is. And the software is thwarting

1872
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:37,460
the execution of the warrant. The

1873
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:39,460
software is thwarting the execution of the warrant.

1874
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,460
In the Justice Department's filing in the case

1875
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,460
involving the iPhone discovered on the suspect,

1876
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:45,460
he's indicted for a drug

1877
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,460
possession, meth.

1878
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,460
And this is an ongoing battle.

1879
01:04:49,460 --> 01:04:51,460
Apple filed a brief saying in most

1880
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:53,460
cases now and in the future it would be impossible

1881
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,460
for it to extract encrypted data

1882
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:57,460
from an iOS device.

1883
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,460
But they dismiss the

1884
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,460
argument, says Apple's asserts,

1885
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:03,460
Apple's burden is not provable since they've done this

1886
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:05,460
before. And

1887
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:07,460
they also say,

1888
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:09,460
moving ahead here, they say

1889
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:11,460
Apple

1890
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,460
should be able to unlock

1891
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,460
it. The government's argument is essentially that Apple

1892
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:17,460
has never really objected to this case and the fact that they

1893
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:19,460
have set up guidelines by which they'll comply

1894
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:21,460
doesn't stop them from objecting to any particular

1895
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,460
case. But they have the ability to do it here and

1896
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,460
clearly the judge was concerned.

1897
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:27,460
Apple also warned

1898
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:29,460
that if we're forced to routinely decrypt data from law enforcement

1899
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,460
its employees could theoretically be subpoenaed in every

1900
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,460
case to provide expert testimony.

1901
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:35,460
They cited a previous case

1902
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:37,460
where an actual employee

1903
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:39,460
who did the decrypting ended up getting hauled into court

1904
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:41,460
because he then saw the evidence.

1905
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:43,460
So just like the technician

1906
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,460
that had to do the decrypting.

1907
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:47,460
Wow. Yeah.

1908
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,460
So there's several things Apple's trying to fight against.

1909
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:51,460
Having to do future decrypting,

1910
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:53,460
having to

1911
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,460
bring its employees into court

1912
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,460
if they do the decrypting.

1913
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,460
And now this argument

1914
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:01,460
that Apple's software licensing agreement

1915
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:03,460
specifies that iOS software is licensed

1916
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:05,460
not sold, quote unquote. And that users

1917
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:07,460
are merely granted a quote

1918
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:09,460
limited non-exclusive license

1919
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:11,460
to use the iOS software.

1920
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,460
So in their argument because it's the software

1921
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,460
preventing the decryption and Apple owns the software

1922
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:17,460
not the user, Apple must decrypt it

1923
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:19,460
because the users don't own the software.

1924
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:21,460
Yeah I like how they came back and said that you know

1925
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:23,460
well you guys have been claiming for so long now that

1926
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:25,460
it's your software that you just licensed in it

1927
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:27,460
so you can't have both sides of it.

1928
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,460
Proprietary software is not ethical.

1929
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:31,460
Yeah you know what else makes me think of?

1930
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:33,460
Malicious functionality perverting

1931
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:35,460
free software. That program

1932
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,460
although it may be attractive

1933
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,460
is really a trap.

1934
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:41,460
I think all of those statements are correct.

1935
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:43,460
All of those statements. He's right.

1936
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:45,460
RMS is right.

1937
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,460
I mean

1938
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:49,460
this

1939
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:51,460
blows my mind. Their argument is literally

1940
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:53,460
that because you don't own the software

1941
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:55,460
you license the software

1942
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:57,460
the manufacturer should be able to decrypt it.

1943
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:59,460
And they might actually get this.

1944
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:01,460
They might actually win on that argument.

1945
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:03,460
They might actually be able to convince the judge of that.

1946
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,460
Maybe Apple

1947
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:07,460
will take their security claims seriously

1948
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,460
enough and change their licensing agreement.

1949
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:11,460
Probably not though.

1950
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:13,460
That would be I guess the best

1951
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:15,460
direct fix right? Right.

1952
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:17,460
I mean they've already got the encryption going on

1953
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:19,460
you know 8 and 9 but.

1954
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:21,460
But doesn't this seem like the biggest argument

1955
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:23,460
like out of all of the arguments

1956
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:25,460
doesn't this

1957
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,460
really fundamentally prove why it's important to

1958
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,460
own your own software? Yes I think so.

1959
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:31,460
Like this is like to me seems like the biggest

1960
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,460
the biggest bullet point for that.

1961
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:35,460
And

1962
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:37,460
there was a post that I caught recently

1963
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:39,460
titled Richard Stallman is the hero the internet

1964
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:41,460
needs. And a few bullet points.

1965
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:43,460
He warned of the growing danger

1966
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,460
of DRM and the great story

1967
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:47,460
The Right to Read in 1997.

1968
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:49,460
He warned about DRM in 97.

1969
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:51,460
He refuses to own a cell phone on the grounds

1970
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:53,460
that it might be used as a tracking or covert listening

1971
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:55,460
device. Slightly paranoid but

1972
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:57,460
looks increasingly possible. Stallman considers

1973
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:59,460
cloud computing. Increasingly. Yeah.

1974
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:01,460
Stallman considers cloud computing dangerous

1975
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,460
in 2008. He thought this would sound

1976
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,460
like an alarmist. Now nobody trusts the cloud.

1977
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:07,460
He always held the proprietary

1978
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:09,460
software could not be trusted. Windows 10

1979
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,460
shaded behavior proves that point.

1980
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,460
You mean the Windows 10 I'm running here

1981
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:15,460
in the studio Chris?

1982
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:17,460
Yeah.

1983
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,460
But he was right. He has been right.

1984
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,460
He's been consistently on the ball there.

1985
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:23,460
Yeah. So I don't know

1986
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:25,460
does anybody in the Mumba Room have thoughts

1987
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:27,460
on the EULAs and not owning the

1988
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:29,460
software and the ramifications that maybe we're

1989
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,460
just now beginning to understand?

1990
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:33,460
I'm still

1991
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:35,460
reading the Windows proper.

1992
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:37,460
Go ahead North Ranger.

1993
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:39,460
Well if

1994
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:41,460
the idea behind

1995
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:43,460
copyright is for the benefit of the public

1996
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:45,460
to secure for authors a limited

1997
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:47,460
time. There's

1998
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,460
really no limits at this point as far as the government

1999
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:51,460
is concerned. Yeah exactly. That's a good point.

2000
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,460
Yeah. Yeah. OK. Now I know two other people

2001
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:55,460
who else want to speak up. I caught that.

2002
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:57,460
Next go ahead and whoever goes first

2003
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:59,460
can have it.

2004
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:01,460
That's not a very good system is it?

2005
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:03,460
Free for all. All right. This is

2006
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,460
unplugged after all.

2007
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,460
Go ahead. Let Sean go first.

2008
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,460
All right Sean go ahead.

2009
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:11,460
I was just saying like given the fact

2010
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:13,460
that basically all

2011
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:15,460
software is licensed do we really

2012
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:17,460
own any of it?

2013
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:19,460
Yeah. I mean I guess you'd have to look into

2014
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:21,460
the individual EULAs for open source software

2015
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:23,460
but I think if you have the code and you can modify

2016
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:25,460
it functionally you own it.

2017
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:27,460
It's at least closer to our

2018
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:29,460
pre-software definition of ownership than

2019
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:31,460
what you get with a Apple

2020
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:33,460
or Windows style license. And Casey you

2021
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:35,460
were next?

2022
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:37,460
Was it Sean that was next?

2023
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:39,460
Sorry I can't see your names guys. The screen is too small for me.

2024
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:41,460
I'm an old man now. No. No. It was

2025
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:43,460
me. Actually

2026
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,460
the EULA for Windows

2027
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:47,460
10 I plan on going over with

2028
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:49,460
and then looking at it. It's pretty

2029
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,460
horrendous when you see that

2030
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:53,460
oh we can use

2031
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,460
subject and

2032
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,460
the body email to

2033
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,460
just return user

2034
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,460
input. It's really bad.

2035
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,460
Yeah. That is a particular nasty one.

2036
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:05,460
And Heavens you want to get a chance to jump in too.

2037
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:09,460
Go ahead.

2038
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:11,460
Oh we can't hear you.

2039
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:13,460
Wow. While he's getting his

2040
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:15,460
mic fixed I would say in the future

2041
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:17,460
I look forward to the day when the DOJ

2042
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:19,460
holds Richard Storman

2043
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:21,460
into court and says

2044
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:23,460
that he has to

2045
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:25,460
speak for the fact that

2046
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:27,460
he created the license and all the stuff on

2047
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,460
my machine is licensed under GPL.

2048
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:31,460
And so he's responsible

2049
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,460
for the software that's on my machine.

2050
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:35,460
There you go. There you go. That's a good twist.

2051
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:37,460
I like that. Heavens one more chance.

2052
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,460
Did you get your mic working?

2053
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,460
Going once? Going twice? I wonder what happened

2054
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:43,460
over there. What happened over there? Maybe pulse

2055
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:45,460
audio. That's what everybody always goes to right? Everybody always has to

2056
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,460
blame pulse audio. All right.

2057
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:49,460
Well Heavens I'll give you a chance to

2058
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:51,460
troubleshoot that for a second. It was just a

2059
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:53,460
thought provoking piece and I wanted to just

2060
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:55,460
kind of call it out because I think it underscores something a lot of us

2061
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,460
Linux and open source enthusiasts have

2062
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:59,460
been talking about for a long time. I'll tell you

2063
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:01,460
about something else I've been talking about. That's Ting

2064
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:03,460
my mobile service provider. Ting is

2065
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,460
mobile that makes sense. It's only pay for what you use

2066
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,460
wireless. It's your minutes, your messages, your

2067
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:09,460
megabytes. They add them up. Whatever bucket you fall into

2068
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:11,460
that's all you pay. It's six dollars

2069
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:13,460
for the line. A great control panel.

2070
01:11:13,460 --> 01:11:15,460
Really enthusiastic customer service.

2071
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:17,460
And really good selection of devices

2072
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:19,460
too. All these are unlocked so you

2073
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:21,460
own them outright. You can go to

2074
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:23,460
linux.ting.com.

2075
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,460
You know Chris I was doing the math yesterday

2076
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:27,460
trying to get my parents to switch to Ting.

2077
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:29,460
I looked at the last

2078
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:31,460
year their bill. They would save an average of

2079
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,460
sixty two dollars a month if they switched to Ting.

2080
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:35,460
That's a nice savings. These are real world figures.

2081
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:37,460
I did it yesterday. Yeah when you go to linux.ting.com

2082
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:39,460
they have a savings calculator there on the front page.

2083
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:41,460
Makes it really easy. Yeah you just plug it in there.

2084
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,460
So would they be getting more of a smartphone

2085
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:45,460
device or more of a feature phone device?

2086
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:47,460
Well this is on their current feature phone trend.

2087
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:49,460
Maybe not the most

2088
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:51,460
current. So they're cool with feature phones?

2089
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:53,460
Yeah and Ting works great with that.

2090
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:55,460
They've been on another provider who

2091
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:57,460
their phones will just work right with Ting.

2092
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:59,460
They won't have to change anything.

2093
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:01,460
Yeah the feature phone prices are ridiculous.

2094
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:03,460
And then of course I love right here that you can

2095
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:05,460
get the Moto X second gen for two ninety nine unlocked.

2096
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:07,460
The Moto Nexus 6

2097
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:09,460
or you can get the LG 5X.

2098
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:11,460
Right when they're ready to go to that next level

2099
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,460
Ting's got it all right there. You own the device

2100
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,460
outright. It's nice. It's nice.

2101
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:17,460
Including my S6 Edge.

2102
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,460
Yeah so you can check them out at linux.ting.com

2103
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,460
I love their customer service.

2104
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:23,460
I love the way their control panel works.

2105
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:25,460
It makes it really easy to manage my account.

2106
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:27,460
It's really easy also to pick between GSM

2107
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:29,460
and CDMA so you can pick and choose which one's

2108
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,460
better in your area. And if you're a little savvy

2109
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:33,460
with Wi-Fi it's going to blow your mind

2110
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:35,460
with the savings. Blow your mind.

2111
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,460
Check it out.

2112
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:39,460
Go to linux.ting.com and a big thanks to Ting

2113
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:41,460
for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

2114
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:43,460
Okay Evans did you get your mic working?

2115
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,460
Did you get it fixed? Going once?

2116
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:47,460
Yes I believe I did.

2117
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:49,460
Yeah you're a little over

2118
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:51,460
you're a little hot but you're good.

2119
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:53,460
You're coming in now.

2120
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:55,460
What did you want to add on before we wrap up?

2121
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:57,460
Sounds good.

2122
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:59,460
What did you want to add on before we wrap up?

2123
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,460
It really just applies

2124
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,460
to Apple's product.

2125
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,460
Apple software or possibly the Apple hardware.

2126
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,460
So if we have a hardware module

2127
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:09,460
which we own ourselves

2128
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:11,460
which they do not own

2129
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:13,460
but their operating system APIs

2130
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:15,460
call, we could have

2131
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:17,460
our own owned

2132
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:19,460
decryption keys.

2133
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:21,460
Kind of like little, you know, cookie or whatever.

2134
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:23,460
Or the SIM card.

2135
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:25,460
That would be nice. It would come down to the user owning

2136
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:27,460
the hardware and then just installing their OS on it.

2137
01:13:27,460 --> 01:13:29,460
Which they would use.

2138
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:31,460
And then they would bypass

2139
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:33,460
the ULS agreement for us using

2140
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:35,460
their software or their OS.

2141
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,460
That's an interesting idea. That is interesting.

2142
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:39,460
I wonder if that would ever actually happen. Ever happen, yeah.

2143
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:41,460
You know, so speaking of hardware

2144
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,460
Yaomei I think is how you say it.

2145
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:45,460
They have been pondering a Linux laptop for a while

2146
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:47,460
and now the folks over at

2147
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:49,460
OMG Ubuntu say it's going to happen.

2148
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:51,460
Their long rumored Linux laptop has been

2149
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,460
kicked around and we've covered it once before

2150
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:55,460
in its earliest stage. It looks like

2151
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:57,460
it's going to be a 12.5 inch display

2152
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:59,460
and then another with a 13.3

2153
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:01,460
inch display.

2154
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:03,460
The model with the 12.5 inch screen will be manufactured by

2155
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:05,460
Inventek, who also makes laptops

2156
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:07,460
for Acer and Toshiba and HP.

2157
01:14:07,460 --> 01:14:09,460
With an initial order of 250,000

2158
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:11,460
units. A slightly larger device is being

2159
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:13,460
made by Compella Electronics.

2160
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:15,460
They also supposedly manufacture some

2161
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,460
Apple devices and various PlayStation, Xbox

2162
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:19,460
and Nintendo game consoles.

2163
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:21,460
And Yaomei is supposedly placing a

2164
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:23,460
300,000 order unit with them.

2165
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,460
Now this would be shipping with their

2166
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:29,460
own version of Linux they say?

2167
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:31,460
Oh interesting. Hopefully with

2168
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:33,460
not too much added tree stuff.

2169
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:35,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2170
01:14:35,460 --> 01:14:37,460
And no word even

2171
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,460
if it'd be shipping anywhere specifically.

2172
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:41,460
According to the same sources

2173
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,460
they'll be priced cheaply but offer high

2174
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:45,460
performance. I like that. Just like the

2175
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:47,460
company's smartphones.

2176
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:49,460
So probably

2177
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:51,460
going to debut in China I would imagine

2178
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:53,460
but maybe eventually make it over here. Is anybody interested

2179
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:55,460
to see what Yaomei could do? Actually

2180
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:57,460
I don't think anybody in here was last time we talked

2181
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,460
about it. Has anybody changed their mind?

2182
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:01,460
No. Seems to be more popular

2183
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:03,460
online though. We've gotten people sending to the show

2184
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:05,460
that are definitely looking forward to it. I mean I'm interested.

2185
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,460
I don't know that I would necessarily get one

2186
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:09,460
but I feel like there's a couple

2187
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:11,460
you know 13, 14 inch laptops that people

2188
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:13,460
can look at. But really

2189
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:15,460
like 90% of the laptop field is boring

2190
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:17,460
15 inch

2191
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:19,460
over you know it's like 5 pounds. It doesn't

2192
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:21,460
have a great resolution. If you're coming into the laptop market

2193
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:23,460
today with a 12.5 inch or

2194
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:25,460
13 inch laptop you are

2195
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:27,460
probably targeting the MacBook Air

2196
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:29,460
right? Right. And so then when

2197
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:31,460
you say that I think

2198
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,460
light, thin, but decent

2199
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:35,460
performance. Right. But if you could

2200
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:37,460
just offer me a few things that the MacBook doesn't

2201
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:39,460
like a couple more ports would be nice. Better

2202
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:41,460
Linux compatibility? Absolutely that would be

2203
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,460
nice. Then maybe you got

2204
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:45,460
something here. And it might be nice to invest

2205
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:47,460
you know maybe not but it's nice to see clearly

2206
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,460
you know the Asus and Acer's of the world

2207
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:51,460
they have some stuff for us but they're

2208
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:53,460
not really supporting our crowd very much.

2209
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,460
We might be able to support a new company who

2210
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:57,460
will leverage that. Yeah System76 has

2211
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:59,460
a laptop in this space. There's the Dell

2212
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,460
XPS. Then you can also go get yourself a

2213
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:03,460
ThinkPad. But

2214
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:05,460
maybe it will be terrible

2215
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,460
I don't know. But there's still room here I think.

2216
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:09,460
No I think there is still room here for this.

2217
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:11,460
You put a really nice screen on there. You put a decent CPU

2218
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:13,460
in there and maybe some PCI Express

2219
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:15,460
storage. At the right price point?

2220
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:17,460
Yeah. I could be interested in that.

2221
01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:19,460
I'm not really in the market right now. My XPS

2222
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:21,460
13 does the job but I could be interested in that.

2223
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,460
Yeah. I don't know.

2224
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,460
Anybody remember I'm interested now? Anybody?

2225
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:27,460
Come on.

2226
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:29,460
I can't believe it. You guys what do you got?

2227
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,460
You're all a bunch of ThinkPad users. No you're just all a bunch of

2228
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:33,460
ThinkPad users.

2229
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:35,460
The problem is

2230
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,460
chances are it's going to only be available in

2231
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,460
China. Probably have some wacky version

2232
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,460
of Linux that doesn't contribute upstream

2233
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:43,460
at all. And so

2234
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:45,460
if I wanted to wipe that and put

2235
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:47,460
something else like Ubuntu Mate or

2236
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:49,460
Ubuntu proper I

2237
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:51,460
would probably find the wireless doesn't work or

2238
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:53,460
the touchpad skitty or whatever.

2239
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:55,460
And I don't want to have

2240
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:57,460
to buy something from China.

2241
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:59,460
Find it doesn't work and then end up putting it in a drawer

2242
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:01,460
or chucking it on eBay. I would rather know that it works

2243
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:03,460
which is why I'm veering towards

2244
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:05,460
a ThinkPad or a Dell XPS.

2245
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:07,460
At least they contribute upstream.

2246
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:09,460
My question would really be is it going to be more Chromebook

2247
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,460
than it is Linux laptop.

2248
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,460
And you know what I just kind of

2249
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:15,460
remembered incidentally

2250
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:17,460
is I believe my

2251
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,460
Chromebook from 2015 was supposed to arrive in September.

2252
01:17:19,460 --> 01:17:21,460
It is now October.

2253
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:23,460
Remember how I

2254
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:25,460
backed that?

2255
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:27,460
I'm sure it's coming soon.

2256
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:29,460
I was told it was. Maybe it's on the doorstep right now.

2257
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:31,460
Maybe. It would still be late.

2258
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,460
I would really

2259
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:35,460
like to do that. All right Swift you want to talk about ThinkPads

2260
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:37,460
go ahead.

2261
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:39,460
Yeah my thing about the whole

2262
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:41,460
ThinkPads thing is while

2263
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:43,460
the recent ones I keep hearing

2264
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:45,460
about the whole Superfish issue

2265
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:47,460
the classic ones are really nice.

2266
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:49,460
The only thing I would say is the resolution

2267
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:51,460
is an issue.

2268
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:53,460
I'm currently in front of an X201

2269
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,460
right now and I love this machine.

2270
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,460
Yeah I think that's

2271
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:59,460
about what I hear all the time.

2272
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:01,460
That seems to be a pretty fair assessment.

2273
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:03,460
Wimpy you have a Librem 13. Tell me what do you think?

2274
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:05,460
Well I have the better version

2275
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:07,460
of the Librem 13 in that I

2276
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:09,460
actually have one that you can buy today

2277
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:11,460
and it works and

2278
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:13,460
is running stuff. Yeah.

2279
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:15,460
Do you like that hardware?

2280
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:17,460
Well I do now that I've

2281
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:19,460
helped fix the touchpad driver

2282
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:21,460
in the Linux kernel. Yes it works very

2283
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:23,460
nicely. But

2284
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:25,460
what's interesting about the Librem 13 I have some

2285
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:27,460
involvement with them. So hello

2286
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:29,460
everyone from

2287
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:31,460
Purism. You'll know me

2288
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:33,460
from the guy that sent you the kernel patches.

2289
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:35,460
But

2290
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:37,460
it's a long time coming

2291
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:39,460
so they're just shipping the Librem

2292
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:41,460
13 and

2293
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:43,460
Entraware who I spoke about

2294
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,460
earlier who have been shipping that hardware

2295
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:47,460
platform since almost

2296
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:49,460
the start of this year

2297
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:51,460
have already revved on

2298
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:53,460
that platform and are just about

2299
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:55,460
to release their new version

2300
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:57,460
based on

2301
01:18:57,460 --> 01:18:59,460
Skylake and that's coming

2302
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:01,460
out next week or the week after.

2303
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:03,460
That's going to be nice.

2304
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:05,460
Yeah and

2305
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:07,460
I just don't get this

2306
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:09,460
Purism thing.

2307
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:11,460
Honestly that and

2308
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:13,460
this YaoMei Linux laptop.

2309
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:15,460
I think this YaoMei Linux laptop

2310
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,460
or however you pronounce it is a total non story

2311
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:19,460
for any actual users.

2312
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,460
I don't think it's going to be a product that we

2313
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,460
really get our hands on.

2314
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,460
Well maybe not in the US

2315
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:27,460
and maybe not in Europe but it could be a thing in China.

2316
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:29,460
But even then they won't even probably know it runs Linux.

2317
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:31,460
Well do they care?

2318
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:33,460
No. They just want something to replace Windows XP

2319
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:35,460
don't they? Yeah.

2320
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:37,460
Our first computer. Not even necessarily

2321
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:39,460
something to replace XP.

2322
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:41,460
There's a giant market of people who've never

2323
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:43,460
even owned a computer at

2324
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:45,460
all out in the burbs and beyond

2325
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:47,460
in China that have

2326
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:49,460
never had a computer. Yeah absolutely

2327
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:51,460
for them. For those people something like this that

2328
01:19:51,460 --> 01:19:53,460
can get on the internet is a fantastic device.

2329
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,460
Very much. I agree.

2330
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,460
And I wait

2331
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:59,460
with anticipation for my Librem so I can

2332
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:01,460
give it a shot. I have been thinking

2333
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:03,460
it would be. Oh oh

2334
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:05,460
oh. Yikes.

2335
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:07,460
Did you hear that? There's a little voice.

2336
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:09,460
How much did you pay for that?

2337
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:11,460
I don't remember. It was during their crowdfunding

2338
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:13,460
and that was

2339
01:20:13,460 --> 01:20:15,460
I think over a year ago now. I can't remember.

2340
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:17,460
Chris believed in it?

2341
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:19,460
Maybe it wasn't a year ago. Maybe it was the beginning

2342
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:21,460
of the year.

2343
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:23,460
Really if I wasn't going to

2344
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:25,460
you know a lot of times

2345
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:27,460
a lot of times I will

2346
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:29,460
buy something specifically so

2347
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:31,460
I can have it for review on the show.

2348
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:33,460
And that does fall into the category of

2349
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:35,460
this from a news

2350
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:37,460
standpoint is an interesting topic

2351
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:39,460
and it's really nice to be able to contribute

2352
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:41,460
some actual genuine

2353
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:43,460
observations on the product in

2354
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:45,460
the shows. So for me that pushes it

2355
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:47,460
over the line. If I didn't have that I don't

2356
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:49,460
think I'd push it over the line.

2357
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:51,460
But it's fair enough.

2358
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:53,460
I think the latest update

2359
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:55,460
from crowd supply said that

2360
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:57,460
the Librem 13 would ship in late

2361
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,460
October.

2362
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:01,460
The 15.

2363
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:03,460
Oh right. Maybe you order the 13.

2364
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:05,460
No the 15 is October 19th

2365
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:07,460
it says here.

2366
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:09,460
OK. So today

2367
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:11,460
is October 27th.

2368
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:13,460
All I'll say is that

2369
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:15,460
the Librem

2370
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:17,460
is about three times over

2371
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:19,460
the price of where you

2372
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:21,460
can get it elsewhere.

2373
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:23,460
And

2374
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:25,460
if you want... Yeah but you get hardware kill switches

2375
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:27,460
though Wimpy. Remember?

2376
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:29,460
Have you

2377
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:31,460
actually seen those?

2378
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:33,460
Well

2379
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:35,460
we'll see. We'll see. The jury is out.

2380
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:37,460
We'll see. Well Chris look

2381
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:39,460
you know if you want

2382
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:41,460
to review another

2383
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:43,460
hardware platform then I know

2384
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:45,460
Entroware would be interested

2385
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:47,460
in hooking you up with one of their new Skylake

2386
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:49,460
devices. Oh they should email me. That sounds fun.

2387
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:51,460
I would not mind a Skylake device. That sounds cool.

2388
01:21:51,460 --> 01:21:53,460
Well all right. I know my

2389
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:55,460
quest. I feel like this quest

2390
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:57,460
this quest for like a laptop

2391
01:21:57,460 --> 01:21:59,460
that would be available in the stores you walk

2392
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:01,460
in and that thing runs Linux it's just...

2393
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:03,460
It's impossible. We're so close but yet

2394
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:05,460
so far away. Like there's really great

2395
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:07,460
places now to go get good devices

2396
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:09,460
like Entroware System 76

2397
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:11,460
and even Dell has

2398
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,460
Linux too. Right? Does Dell start

2399
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:15,460
shipping that again? I can't keep track of what they do with Linux.

2400
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:17,460
But in theory they will. OK. So there

2401
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:19,460
are... But you have to know.

2402
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:21,460
That's the thing. You have to know.

2403
01:22:21,460 --> 01:22:23,460
Just spend a significant time investment

2404
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:25,460
in getting all that out. You know what else

2405
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:27,460
you have to know? You ready for this Wes?

Wes anywhere you want people to check you out online?

2418
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:53,460
Not this week. But there should be some

2419
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:55,460
stuff coming. Mysterious.

2423
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:03,460
to Sunday this week

2424
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:05,460
to make room for some stuff. So check

2425
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:07,460
out Linux Action Show on Sunday instead of Friday.

2426
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:29,460
And see you right back here next week everybody.

2427
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:59,460
Alright

2428
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:01,460
Wes we're all done. We're out of here. We're done.

2429
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:03,460
Mission accomplished.

2430
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:05,460
Yes it was. Thanks everybody.

2431
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,460
Thank you everyone.

2432
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:09,460
Sorry for being a grumpy

2433
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:11,460
old sod about Nebrum.

2434
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:13,460
No no it's fine. It's good.

2435
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:15,460
I'm sure you'll have fun

2436
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:17,460
reviewing the device. Oh well we'll see.

2437
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:19,460
Linux communities survive on

2438
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:21,460
grump. So it's needed.

2439
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:23,460
I think people

2440
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:25,460
have gotten a little too

2441
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:27,460
sensitive about criticism.

2442
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:29,460
Just saying there's people out there that get a little too sensitive

2443
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:31,460
about it. Sometimes criticism can be well

2444
01:24:31,460 --> 01:24:33,460
placed. So criticize Chris as much as you

2445
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:35,460
want. He takes it very well. Oh my god don't

2446
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:37,460
they. Oh brilliant.

2447
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:39,460
If there is seriously

2448
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:41,460
people just criticize me constantly.

2449
01:24:41,460 --> 01:24:43,460
They really do. And that's how you got so good.

2450
01:24:43,460 --> 01:24:45,460
Oh sure. That's why you moved away

2451
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:47,460
from IRC. Why you moved away from

2452
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:49,460
Telegram.

2453
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:51,460
No kidding. No that's

2454
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:53,460
not true. I'm in IRC all the time. But yeah

2455
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:55,460
it is

2456
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:57,460
very true. And you know honestly

2457
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:59,460
there's just tools to tune it out

2458
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:01,460
too if it gets ridiculous. That's really what

2459
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:03,460
it's about is like you know

2460
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:05,460
there are there are there are plugins to

2461
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:07,460
you know just turn off comments when you don't

2462
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:09,460
want to see them. And there's there's all kinds of things you can

2463
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:11,460
do but you just got to walk the line because you don't want to overdo

2464
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:13,460
it either. JBDotless.com JBDotless.com

2465
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:15,460
I wasn't I wasn't trying to enroll

2466
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:17,460
myself into your twit filter. I was

2467
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:19,460
I was just trying to

2468
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:21,460
provide some

2469
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:23,460
level headed. I suppose

2470
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:25,460
I'm just

2471
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:27,460
forewarning you.

2472
01:25:27,460 --> 01:25:29,460
Yeah.

2473
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:31,460
Oh man.

2474
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,460
There's a little bit of a bummer.

2475
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:35,460
It's a bit of a bummer. And you know what

2476
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:37,460
else is if if if you

2477
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:39,460
if you if you had paid

2478
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:41,460
for the

2479
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:43,460
for the Librem 13 what

2480
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:45,460
you can get for it elsewhere and what

2481
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:47,460
you know what you pay for it elsewhere

2482
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:49,460
it's a good machine.

2483
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:51,460
But it's like three times more

2484
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:53,460
expensive through Librem

2485
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:55,460
and they're trying to pitch this as like

2486
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:57,460
an Apple type

2487
01:25:57,460 --> 01:25:59,460
product and it just isn't that.

2488
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:01,460
So yeah.

2489
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:03,460
It's well you know fundamentally how

2490
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:05,460
does a brand new company

2491
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,460
compete with a 30 year old company

2492
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:09,460
at manufacturing. How do you even do that fundamentally.

2493
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:11,460
Even if it's well and

2494
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:13,460
the other thing is is that Pureism have tried to

2495
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:15,460
pitch that they know they're doing all of this manufacturing

2496
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:17,460
themselves and that's not the case either.

2497
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:19,460
So you know it's

2498
01:26:19,460 --> 01:26:21,460
a little bit smoke and mirrors.

2499
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:23,460
Mm hmm.

2500
01:26:23,460 --> 01:26:25,460
So Chris can I criticize

2501
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:27,460
you for being so negative on the

2502
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:29,460
Xiaomi laptop.

2503
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:31,460
Sure. Yeah that's fine. Yeah you think

2504
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:33,460
you think it has a you think it has a good chance of becoming

2505
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:35,460
big. Well I

2506
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:37,460
won't make any

2507
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:39,460
prophecy but this company has been doing

2508
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:41,460
great phones and

2509
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:43,460
they really it seems like they really

2510
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:45,460
have a great price to performance

2511
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:47,460
ratio and also their devices

2512
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:49,460
are always very well thought out

2513
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:51,460
and they are also a very big manufacturer

2514
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:53,460
of phones. So I think they have

2515
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:55,460
quite some experience and I was actually hopeful

2516
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,460
that they might shake up things a little bit.

2517
01:26:57,460 --> 01:26:59,460
Well you should have said that in the show.

2518
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:01,460
That's a good you know I hope

2519
01:27:01,460 --> 01:27:03,460
and I agree. I think probably

2520
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:05,460
if you could I would I would criticize our takeaway

2521
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:07,460
on is it could be big for

2522
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,460
for thousands and thousands of people but

2523
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:11,460
just not for us. I mean that's that's jaded

2524
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:13,460
Americans. Yeah. The problem is

2525
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:15,460
getting into the U.S. market I think

2526
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:17,460
for a lot of these products.

2527
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:19,460
Not really. The Chinese market

2528
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:21,460
is gigantic

2529
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:23,460
and that's

2530
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:25,460
this we like we

2531
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:27,460
get this in Ubuntu we get like

2532
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:29,460
when is it coming to the U.S. when is it coming

2533
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:31,460
to the U.S. and there's like 300 million

2534
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:33,460
people in the U.S. or whatever your

2535
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:35,460
population is but there's a shit ton of

2536
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:37,460
people over in China as well

2537
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:39,460
and those people are

2538
01:27:39,460 --> 01:27:41,460
people who are actually buying devices

2539
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:43,460
who don't

2540
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:45,460
currently have a device and

2541
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,460
or don't currently have a laptop and so

2542
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:49,460
there's a gigantic untapped

2543
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:51,460
market over that side

2544
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:53,460
of the planet. And that middle that middle class over there is

2545
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:55,460
expanding you know I mean there's

2546
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:57,460
there is a lot there's a lot of

2547
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:59,460
growth potential over there right now. Yeah. When

2548
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:01,460
when Apple's profits in just China

2549
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:03,460
dwarf Samsung

2550
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:05,460
and Motorola and LG

2551
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:07,460
and everybody else combined

2552
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:09,460
you know that's a big market.

2553
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:11,460
Yeah. Also China has one seventh

2554
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:13,460
of the world's population so

2555
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:15,460
yeah and so it could be

2556
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,460
I'm really excited for my Chinese MacBook Air.

2557
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,460
Yeah. Yeah. So exactly

2558
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,460
it could be a Chinese MacBook Air exactly

2559
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:23,460
and it could eventually make its way over.

2560
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:25,460
Exactly like a MacBook Air. Well that picture

2561
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:27,460
might literally be a MacBook Air.

2562
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:29,460
I don't know. Yeah. Well you know I'm curious

2563
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:31,460
if. Yeah that's the funny thing.

2564
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:33,460
I saw a comment before

2565
01:28:33,460 --> 01:28:35,460
it was really funny

2566
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:37,460
in IRC I saw a comment that said

2567
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:39,460
that they could just

2568
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:41,460
ship from China a

2569
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:43,460
MacBook that has an Apple logo

2570
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:45,460
that just runs elementary OS.

2571
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:47,460
I thought that was funny. But I'm

2572
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:49,460
bummed.

2573
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:51,460
What's new mate?

2574
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:53,460
I have been looking at

2575
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:55,460
new phones like you know

2576
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:57,460
looking at what alternative devices

2577
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:59,460
are there out there and the

2578
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:01,460
Xiaomi phones look

2579
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:03,460
really nice. They're

2580
01:29:03,460 --> 01:29:05,460
nice mid to high range

2581
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:07,460
high end like you're talking like

2582
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:09,460
three gig of RAM rather than two.

2583
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:11,460
They look with 4G

2584
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:13,460
chipsets and decent resolution

2585
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:15,460
screen and multiple

2586
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:17,460
SIM slots and all that kind of stuff for

2587
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:19,460
a really decent price

2588
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:21,460
point like $180 or something like that.

2589
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:23,460
Yeah I know. But you have to get rid of the software

2590
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:25,460
if you've used one and the Chinese software

2591
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:27,460
on there oh man.

2592
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:29,460
Right. Probably wipe it and put

2593
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:31,460
cyanogen or something else on there.

2594
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:33,460
Anyway.

2595
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:35,460
It almost reminds me of that Windows firmware

2596
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:37,460
thing with the

2597
01:29:37,460 --> 01:29:39,460
I don't know that it was

2598
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:41,460
Windows something

2599
01:29:41,460 --> 01:29:43,460
with the BIOS or something like

2600
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:45,460
that with the firmware that something

2601
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:47,460
was in there. I saw I heard

2602
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:49,460
on a previous show I don't know if it was Linux Action

2603
01:29:49,460 --> 01:29:51,460
Show or Linux Unplugged or something like that

2604
01:29:51,460 --> 01:29:53,460
but I heard about

2605
01:29:53,460 --> 01:29:55,460
Windows loading something

2606
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:57,460
onto your oh yes it was

2607
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:59,460
for the OEM or the OEM

2608
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,460
laptops where the manufacturer

2609
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:03,460
or someone could put

2610
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:05,460
special firmware on your

2611
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:07,460
on your

2612
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:09,460
on your device whenever you installed

2613
01:30:09,460 --> 01:30:11,460
Windows on the if you reinstall

2614
01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:13,460
Windows it would automatically install those applications

2615
01:30:13,460 --> 01:30:15,460
again. Yeah.

2616
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:17,460
It kind of reminds me of that. Yeah.

2617
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:19,460
Yeah. Again.

2618
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:21,460
I think we should go with What's New Mate

2619
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:23,460
or Mate. That sounds good to me. I think I like it.

2620
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,460
It was a good conversation.

2621
01:30:25,460 --> 01:30:27,460
Thank you Wimpy for making it in here on the

2622
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:29,460
and thank you Poppy for paying Wimpy.

2623
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:31,460
No thank you.

2624
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:33,460
Thank you very much. I'm just Popey's

2625
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:35,460
he summoned you

2626
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:37,460
we were going to

2627
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:39,460
well it was either that or sick the whole chat room on you

2628
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:41,460
and so we figured that was probably more more efficient

2629
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:43,460
to anything. Well yeah. Yeah.

2630
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:45,460
So thank you for making it. And thank

2631
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:47,460
you guys for being here. Yeah.

2632
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,460
And so chat room don't forget I mentioned it right

2633
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:51,460
at the end of the show but we're going to do Linux Action Show on

2634
01:30:51,460 --> 01:30:53,460
Sunday. Sunday.

2635
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:55,460
Probably 10 a.m. or regular time. Yeah.

2636
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:57,460
So OK. All right.

2637
01:30:57,460 --> 01:30:59,460
Bye Mumble Room. Thank you for being here.

2638
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:01,460
When do you change your clocks? Is it

2639
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:03,460
Saturday night Sunday morning.

2640
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:05,460
Oh my God. Oh my God.

2641
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,460
Is that a thing. Could I possibly

2642
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:09,460
have you change this weekend.

2643
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:11,460
Oh why did I have to.

2644
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:13,460
On the one day we moved back to Sunday.

2645
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:15,460
Oh my God.

2646
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:17,460
Oh my God.

2647
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:19,460
Oh my God. It's horrible.

2648
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:21,460
That could not have gotten more worse.

2649
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:23,460
Just set it back an hour. Yeah.

2650
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:25,460
That is horrible.

2651
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:27,460
Just do it early on Saturday.

2652
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:29,460
You know what makes it even more complicated

2653
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:31,460
is Noah is traveling across time zones right now.

2654
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:33,460
And he will be traveling

2655
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:35,460
while we're doing the show across time zones.

2656
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:37,460
Oh that's going to be disaster.

2657
01:31:37,460 --> 01:32:03,460
Holy crap.
