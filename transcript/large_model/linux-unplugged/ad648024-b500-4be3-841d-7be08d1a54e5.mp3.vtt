00:00.000 --> 00:15.840
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:15.840 --> 00:16.840
My name is Chris.

00:16.840 --> 00:17.840
My name is Wes.

00:17.840 --> 00:18.840
And my name is Brent.

00:18.840 --> 00:19.840
Hello, gentlemen.

00:19.840 --> 00:22.960
It is great to be gathered together with you today.

00:22.960 --> 00:29.360
We pushed the Hercules of Linux workstations to the breaking point, so find out how far

00:29.360 --> 00:32.280
we push the new Thaleo from System76.

00:32.280 --> 00:35.440
We got a beast in house, and we attempt to tame it.

00:35.440 --> 00:38.760
Plus, there's something that seems to be concerning the community, a little bit of inaccurate

00:38.760 --> 00:42.280
information kind of regarding drivers and open source stuff and kernel stuff.

00:42.280 --> 00:46.320
We just want to address all of it here in the show, just sort of try to get our take

00:46.320 --> 00:48.480
on it and maybe get the right information out there.

00:48.480 --> 00:52.120
So we're going to talk about that coming up in the show in just a few moments.

00:52.120 --> 00:58.920
And then we'll round it out with some boosts and picks, and I mean, picks and a lot more.

00:58.920 --> 01:03.200
So before we go any further, let's say time appropriate greetings to our virtual log.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.200
Hello, Mumble Room.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.200
Hello, friends.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.200
Hello, Chris.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.200
Hey, Wes.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.200
And hello, Brent.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.200
Aw.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.200
Hey, fam.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.200
How's it going over there?

01:11.200 --> 01:12.200
Nice to see you all in there.

01:12.200 --> 01:17.620
If you'd like to join our Mumble Room, jupyterbroadcasting.com slash mumble for the info, we live stream

01:17.620 --> 01:23.240
over on jupyter.tube on Sundays at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

01:23.240 --> 01:24.800
Like maniacs.

01:24.800 --> 01:29.640
And it's archived up there for your perusal later on, if you'd like to view the sausage

01:29.640 --> 01:30.640
factory.

01:30.640 --> 01:31.640
Jupiter.tube.

01:31.640 --> 01:32.640
Jupiter.tube.

01:32.640 --> 01:36.480
And we also want to say good morning to our friends over at TailScale.

01:36.480 --> 01:39.160
TailScale is a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.160
We love it.

01:40.160 --> 01:43.040
It is the definition of a game changer.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.080
All of us love TailScale here so much.

01:45.080 --> 01:51.580
I think every single JB host, everybody on the team is using TailScale.

01:51.580 --> 01:54.520
So go say good morning to one of our favorite tools out there and get it for free up to

01:54.520 --> 01:58.560
20 devices at TailScale.com.

01:58.560 --> 02:01.400
Tell them Unplugged sent you if they ask, I don't know.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.420
Maybe just volunteer that anyway, even if they don't ask.

02:03.420 --> 02:07.760
You could go to TailScale.com slash coder and then they'd know it came from JB, I suppose.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.640
Maybe I should be plugging that.

02:09.640 --> 02:12.960
Let's talk about something that's kind of going off like crazy this weekend.

02:12.960 --> 02:16.600
I didn't even really see when this video got posted from Linus Tech Tips.

02:16.600 --> 02:21.560
I'll pull that up while we talk about this, but there has been a lot of discussion around

02:21.560 --> 02:24.320
Intel's new Arc GPU.

02:24.320 --> 02:29.040
And it is really exciting because it's got an open source driver stack.

02:29.040 --> 02:33.040
The Intel stuff has always worked really well on Linux and now they're making dedicated

02:33.040 --> 02:34.040
GPUs.

02:34.040 --> 02:42.000
And on October 5th, the Linus Tech Tips channel posted their take on the Arc GPU.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.440
And they said something in there that seems to have confused a lot of people online.

02:45.440 --> 02:49.320
And so I want to play that moment for you here on the show and then we will address

02:49.320 --> 02:53.280
it after we've heard it so that way we know what we're talking about.

02:53.280 --> 02:57.480
Intel also made a good case for not using Arc on Linux for the foreseeable future.

02:57.480 --> 03:03.160
Sorry guys, I know that you had high hopes, but currently Arc only supports kernel version

03:03.160 --> 03:04.160
6.

03:04.160 --> 03:09.600
And Intel has said that they do not plan on supporting version 5, meaning that every stable

03:09.600 --> 03:12.520
version of Linux is currently not supported.

03:12.520 --> 03:16.640
To put this in perspective for the non-Linux folks out there, this is basically like Intel

03:16.640 --> 03:20.760
launching a product, but only having drivers for Windows 12.

03:20.760 --> 03:27.840
So this is a little confusing because it sounds like if you're on Linux and you're using

03:27.840 --> 03:31.340
a distribution, you're not going to be able to get access to the Intel Arc GPU because

03:31.340 --> 03:35.960
Intel hasn't released drivers for the previous kernel.

03:35.960 --> 03:39.920
There's a way in which that is true, but the way this works when you're a developer that's

03:39.920 --> 03:44.080
contributing upstream is you contribute to the current development branch.

03:44.080 --> 03:47.400
And so Linus pulls these in and then it ships in that version of the kernel and forward

03:47.400 --> 03:48.760
and they maintain it.

03:48.760 --> 03:53.520
It is pretty uncommon for that stuff to be backported unless the developer chooses to

03:53.520 --> 03:56.640
do it themselves or a distribution chooses to do it.

03:56.640 --> 03:59.840
Does this all sync with, track with how you view it Wes?

03:59.840 --> 04:02.400
Yeah, that seems to be how things are usually done, right?

04:02.400 --> 04:03.800
I mean, you've got to contribute it upstream.

04:03.800 --> 04:07.560
You can't magically make it show up on all these older kernels and maybe a lot of work

04:07.560 --> 04:09.280
and no one's willing to do that work.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.280
It doesn't just happen.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.280
Yeah.

04:11.280 --> 04:17.520
And if you think about the way things are, 6.0 is the current version of Linux.

04:17.520 --> 04:20.440
The 5.0 series is now an older version.

04:20.440 --> 04:21.440
It's okay.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.440
You can say old and busted.

04:22.440 --> 04:27.620
Well, see what happens is distributions, they're kind of forking it when they take, they fork

04:27.620 --> 04:30.400
it and they support a certain version for a while.

04:30.400 --> 04:35.880
And so it wouldn't even necessarily land in say Ubuntu's 5.0 series kernel if Intel did

04:35.880 --> 04:40.720
even contribute it back to the 5.0 series because it's its own branch now.

04:40.720 --> 04:45.100
And so generally what we recommend here on the show is if you want to play around with

04:45.100 --> 04:50.800
cutting edge hardware, you need to run a very current distribution, probably a rolling distro

04:50.800 --> 04:55.040
if you can or something like Fedora, it stays really current because that's how you're going

04:55.040 --> 04:56.540
to get access to those drivers.

04:56.540 --> 05:00.760
And this is something that tricks up reviewers that are kind of new to Linux and they come

05:00.760 --> 05:02.600
in and they don't really understand how this works.

05:02.600 --> 05:07.240
And we've seen it with previous AMD video card releases, they'll have maybe like an

05:07.240 --> 05:11.480
Ubuntu LTS installed or maybe one version back of Ubuntu installed and they'll throw

05:11.480 --> 05:15.480
the new GPU in the system and fire it up and it's not working.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.960
They said it supports Ubuntu but it's not working.

05:17.960 --> 05:22.420
It's because that driver, that stuff goes upstream and while it means that you have

05:22.420 --> 05:26.200
to wait a little bit till it trickles down to your distribution or you can choose to

05:26.200 --> 05:29.360
use a more current distribution, you have the choice.

05:29.360 --> 05:34.280
It means that that's going in at the base layer, like it's baked in now to Linux, right?

05:34.280 --> 05:39.800
It's like built in support and everything that ever gets built off of 6.0 or later now

05:39.800 --> 05:41.400
just has it.

05:41.400 --> 05:45.660
And ultimately, it's the best way to support something like this is to have the developer

05:45.660 --> 05:50.720
contribute upstream and then have that work integrated with distributions as they package

05:50.720 --> 05:51.720
it.

05:51.720 --> 05:55.540
And it's a kind of a funky way Linux works because it's different than Windows where

05:55.540 --> 06:00.000
you'd get maybe like a driver installer that supports a couple of versions of Windows instead

06:00.000 --> 06:04.680
of just the most recent version with the most recent service pack.

06:04.680 --> 06:08.420
That's how maybe people expect it to work you think because there's a lot of confusion

06:08.420 --> 06:09.420
around this right now.

06:09.420 --> 06:11.720
Well, yeah, I mean, we just have as usual on Linux, right?

06:11.720 --> 06:12.880
There's more ways that we do things.

06:12.880 --> 06:17.920
You can get a roll in up to date distribution or if one of the stable releases happened

06:17.920 --> 06:22.920
to have coincided with when this made it into the kernel, then it would just be there.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.580
But we get to pick and choose.

06:24.580 --> 06:28.320
One of the benefits of some of these stable releases is they are stable, right?

06:28.320 --> 06:29.320
You don't have to worry.

06:29.320 --> 06:33.680
And if you're like many people who don't need to fuss around with this fancy brand new to

06:33.680 --> 06:38.460
the market first version discrete GPU from Intel, that's something you like or at least

06:38.460 --> 06:39.760
a lot of people seem to like.

06:39.760 --> 06:45.400
Clearly not here in the studio, but many people seem to like and that's just part of the trade

06:45.400 --> 06:46.400
off unfortunately.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.940
I would like to see it maybe a little bit easier because you probably need like updated

06:48.940 --> 06:49.940
Mesa as well.

06:49.940 --> 06:50.940
Yeah.

06:50.940 --> 06:54.920
You know, so I think it could be easier if you were willing to make that trade off.

06:54.920 --> 06:58.880
Obviously you lose kind of all the planned and integrated support for a particular kernel

06:58.880 --> 07:01.040
shipped from your distribution if you do that.

07:01.040 --> 07:04.120
But it'd be nice if it was easy to be like, well, I just want I just want new features.

07:04.120 --> 07:08.200
I don't think this comes up a lot because I don't think traditionally people that run

07:08.200 --> 07:12.000
Linux are buying the absolute latest graphics card as is being put on the market.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.880
Well, they don't ship that in like my four year old ThinkPad.

07:14.880 --> 07:15.880
So how am I?

07:15.880 --> 07:16.880
How's that going to work?

07:16.880 --> 07:21.720
But what is really, really kind of just really demonstrates the point here of why it's great

07:21.720 --> 07:23.140
to have it upstream.

07:23.140 --> 07:28.460
So we have the Thaleo in house right now and it ships with Pop OS and it's all fully tested

07:28.460 --> 07:31.580
and integrated with the kernel and the Nvidia driver in it.

07:31.580 --> 07:33.360
Everything ships working.

07:33.360 --> 07:35.920
So of course we went ahead and broke it immediately and put Nix OS on there.

07:35.920 --> 07:39.960
So not immediately, but pretty soon afterwards, because of course we wanted to do a series

07:39.960 --> 07:41.440
of extensive testing.

07:41.440 --> 07:46.800
So we wanted to use Nix OS and Nix OS is basically a rolling distribution.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.840
I don't say it's not cutting edge.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.400
It's just current software.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.400
Nix OS is current software.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.400
Yeah.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.080
It feels like it's maybe not in a hurry, you know, like a new release dropped.

07:55.080 --> 07:58.000
It's not like immediately packaged all the time, depending on what it is.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.960
But it's, you know, pretty quickly.

07:59.960 --> 08:00.960
Yeah.

08:00.960 --> 08:06.360
So we were doing an update and it was pulling down Linux 6.0.

08:06.360 --> 08:10.320
But the Nvidia driver, at least the stable released Nvidia driver, doesn't work with

08:10.320 --> 08:11.840
Linux 6.0 yet.

08:11.840 --> 08:15.360
And so our upgrade failed because we were trying to install a version of the kernel

08:15.360 --> 08:18.480
that was incompatible with our proprietary video driver.

08:18.480 --> 08:22.480
And so Nix doesn't proceed if it's going to break and so it bails.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.400
And this is the exact opposite.

08:24.400 --> 08:29.040
With something that's upstream, like these Intel Arc drivers now, you will always have

08:29.040 --> 08:30.360
support in the kernel.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.940
So you can always go with the latest kernel if you want.

08:32.940 --> 08:34.140
These upgrades won't fail.

08:34.140 --> 08:41.480
You don't have to wait for Intel to release a driver for Linux 6.0 now and 6.1 and all

08:41.480 --> 08:42.480
of these things.

08:42.480 --> 08:43.600
It's just built in forever now.

08:43.600 --> 08:48.600
It's the exact opposite experience when you're trying to use leading edge software with something

08:48.600 --> 08:49.960
like an Nvidia card.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.280
It's just it's such a pain in the butt.

08:52.280 --> 08:53.280
And this solves that.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.280
Yeah, right.

08:54.280 --> 08:57.600
I mean, it's like the trade off of this sort of unfortunate uncertainty around release

08:57.600 --> 08:59.980
time and when exactly support there.

08:59.980 --> 09:04.520
You trade off having once it's in, it's just in as long as anyone's meaningfully using

09:04.520 --> 09:08.360
those devices, the kernel will probably keep it hanging around and you can just forget

09:08.360 --> 09:09.360
about it, right?

09:09.360 --> 09:13.160
You just grab whatever distribution, put it on that machine and it'll work.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.580
And as you would expect, once again, Michael Larbel over at Ferronix really does have the

09:17.580 --> 09:19.240
best coverage on this stuff.

09:19.240 --> 09:24.280
He's got one of these, you know, a mid-level one is like 280 bucks.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.280
It's pretty good.

09:25.280 --> 09:31.480
If you want a high performance desktop with 3D acceleration for video playback and your

09:31.480 --> 09:35.960
desktop environment, and you want to play some games, maybe not like maybe you're not

09:35.960 --> 09:38.920
a hardcore gamer, but you want to play some games.

09:38.920 --> 09:43.180
This dedicated Intel Arc GPU seems like it really could hit that sweet spot.

09:43.180 --> 09:46.480
And so Larbel talks over here, he says the caveat that exists for the graphics micro

09:46.480 --> 09:49.520
controller is the GUC firmware.

09:49.520 --> 09:55.820
And as with the past decade of Radeon GPUs and the NVIDIA stuff, it does have a signed

09:55.820 --> 09:57.120
firmware that has to get loaded.

09:57.120 --> 10:03.240
So the driver is open source and it's built on the integrated driver stack and extended,

10:03.240 --> 10:06.900
but it does have the requirement of being able to load proprietary blobs and you do

10:06.900 --> 10:11.360
need Linux 6.0 and Mesa 22.2.

10:11.360 --> 10:16.000
But we've been tracking this story in Linux Action News because I think this is a pretty

10:16.000 --> 10:17.920
important development.

10:17.920 --> 10:22.840
And Intel is really serious about adding a GPU to the market that is affordable and has

10:22.840 --> 10:24.880
an open source driver stack.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.600
And I'll take more of those.

10:26.600 --> 10:27.600
Yeah.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.160
I'm thinking about voting with my wallet on this one.

10:29.160 --> 10:35.260
If I'm hearing you right, does that mean that Linus of Linux Tech Tips got it wrong or is

10:35.260 --> 10:38.040
just a misinterpretation of what he said?

10:38.040 --> 10:39.040
I think so.

10:39.040 --> 10:42.400
If you listen to the clip, what I heard is actually probably anything.

10:42.400 --> 10:47.900
It's probably just they were rushed when they were scripting this video because it's actually

10:47.900 --> 10:53.360
it's it's it's kind of a transition that he makes and it's kind of clunky.

10:53.360 --> 10:57.360
Intel also made a good case for not using Archon Linux for the foreseeable future.

10:57.360 --> 11:02.560
See, that's just that is factually wrong because it's available on Linux right now.

11:02.560 --> 11:06.240
It's available in the latest version of Linux immediately, like on that Nix system that

11:06.240 --> 11:09.560
was upgrading to 6.0 or, you know, it's already available.

11:09.560 --> 11:14.840
And is Intel making a case or are they just sort of doing the normal development model

11:14.840 --> 11:16.600
that they do with the Linux platform?

11:16.600 --> 11:17.600
Right.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.960
So the making the case thing was a segue from something else he was talking about in the

11:20.960 --> 11:26.040
Windows world where Intel made a case about something and that was just a bad segue.

11:26.040 --> 11:30.100
And then he combines it with not really understanding that it's actually an incredible achievement

11:30.100 --> 11:34.160
to have the video driver upstreamed and open source in the Linux kernel.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.220
And it's like the opposite of not supported.

11:36.220 --> 11:38.280
It's like fully supported the way we would want it.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.220
But, you know, they don't know the nuance on that one.

11:40.220 --> 11:45.060
They just know that if you're on like an Ubuntu LTS or a five series kernel, which is pretty

11:45.060 --> 11:49.960
much everybody today, you couldn't actually just plug this in and use it.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.400
The opposite, the flip side of that is if you have a modern kernel and modern Mesa,

11:53.400 --> 11:56.240
you literally just plug it in and you're done.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.860
Where on Windows, I'm sure you got to run a bunch of installer wizard crap and reboot

11:59.860 --> 12:00.920
a few times, right?

12:00.920 --> 12:01.920
It's going to be a mess.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.360
On Linux, it's even better supported.

12:03.360 --> 12:04.880
It just has to be current Linux.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.680
And this is something I think we need to get reviewers to wrap their head around because

12:07.680 --> 12:10.320
it's traditionally been the written press that gets this wrong.

12:10.320 --> 12:14.680
But I think as hardware and tech reviewers start covering Linux more as it grows, like

12:14.680 --> 12:19.880
Linus Tech Tips obviously is, then maybe there needs to be a little bit more of an understanding

12:19.880 --> 12:23.040
of how the development cycle works when it comes to video card drivers and drivers in

12:23.040 --> 12:25.040
general because it's not what they expect.

12:25.040 --> 12:28.460
Traditionally they expect an installer that supports a range of shipped operating systems

12:28.460 --> 12:29.460
on the market today.

12:29.460 --> 12:30.460
Yeah.

12:30.460 --> 12:31.600
And I mean, it could be better, right?

12:31.600 --> 12:35.200
Like it's fine to point out that, you know, hey, if you're just running these stable releases,

12:35.200 --> 12:36.440
this won't work for you right away.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.720
And that's a totally reasonable point to make.

12:38.720 --> 12:41.720
Maybe especially for his audience that it probably has a lot of sort of maybe Linux

12:41.720 --> 12:46.600
curious but not Linux experts like we're lucky enough to have as a subset of our audience.

12:46.600 --> 12:51.000
But you just kind of, you know, as you're saying, add the nuance there to say there

12:51.000 --> 12:54.900
are plenty of distros available if that's what you want and you want to have software

12:54.900 --> 12:56.840
running Linux to play with this new card.

12:56.840 --> 12:57.840
That's the thing you can do.

12:57.840 --> 13:01.800
You just need a specific version.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.760
Linode.com slash unplugged.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.840
That's where you go to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

13:06.840 --> 13:10.800
And it's a great way to show support for the show while you're checking out something awesome.

13:10.800 --> 13:15.320
Linode is really, truly the Linux geeks cloud, 11 data centers worldwide.

13:15.320 --> 13:19.320
And they've been hard at work for nearly 19 years just building the best experience to

13:19.320 --> 13:21.720
run your applications on Linux.

13:21.720 --> 13:22.720
That's it right there.

13:22.720 --> 13:26.440
And to do that, they had to create a genuine support department that actually sticks with

13:26.440 --> 13:27.440
you.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.080
The first person you call is the person that helps you.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.560
They had to build fast infrastructure.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.960
They had to become their own ISP.

13:32.960 --> 13:37.580
And they had to figure out how to use Linux to do these things before anybody else did.

13:37.580 --> 13:38.580
And the performance truly is incredible.

13:38.580 --> 13:43.600
I mean, I just wouldn't run all of JB's infrastructure over there unless it was great.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.640
Like the new website, super fast.

13:45.640 --> 13:46.920
We're running it on Linode.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.040
It's great.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.080
We take advantage of some of their backend features too.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.480
Like if an application needs it, we'll use their MVME storage.

13:53.480 --> 13:54.480
Screaming fast.

13:54.480 --> 13:57.600
And of course, you know, we love their S3 object storage as well.

13:57.600 --> 14:03.360
But you know, there's been some research done recently that really underscores how big enterprises

14:03.360 --> 14:07.740
and medium companies that have really gone all in with the hyperscalers are now kind

14:07.740 --> 14:09.960
of looking for an alternative cloud provider.

14:09.960 --> 14:13.120
In fact, more and more enterprises are embracing that idea.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.760
Just looking somewhere where they don't have so much lock-in.

14:15.760 --> 14:19.240
And I think Linode's performance and price combination is what's going to bring people

14:19.240 --> 14:20.240
through the door.

14:20.240 --> 14:24.280
So I'm going to link to a paper, a research paper that kind of talks about this a little

14:24.280 --> 14:25.280
bit.

14:25.280 --> 14:29.280
If you need some ammunition inside your corporation to advocate for something like this.

14:29.280 --> 14:36.320
Because when you combine just the speed, availability, the support, and the fact that Linode is going

14:36.320 --> 14:42.720
to deploy a dozen new data centers next year, it's really going to take things to the next

14:42.720 --> 14:43.720
level.

14:43.720 --> 14:49.320
And then if you're just a single home user who wants a blog or a gaming server, Linode

14:49.320 --> 14:51.040
has rigs for that too.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.440
And for different expertise levels.

14:52.440 --> 14:56.800
If you've never deployed a server or if you love building it from the ground up.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.960
That's a really unique package that's becoming less and less common, I have to say.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.440
Especially as those hyperscalers sort of take over the whole world and they lock things

15:04.440 --> 15:10.400
up behind these archaic sort of corporate thick verbiage for all of their different

15:10.400 --> 15:14.320
features that are just like re-implementations of free software.

15:14.320 --> 15:15.600
I don't know.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.200
Just that model just doesn't seem like it's going to work forever.

15:18.200 --> 15:21.840
And after you've been using Linode for a minute, well you're going to wonder why you ever did

15:21.840 --> 15:22.840
it any other way.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.720
Especially when you start integrating some of their tools like their great API or use

15:25.720 --> 15:29.660
some standard infrastructure management tools because they support all that as well.

15:29.660 --> 15:34.800
So for the best customer support, super fast rigs, and a Linux culture that runs deep.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.960
Those are some of the reasons I choose Linode, but go find your own reasons.

15:37.960 --> 15:38.960
Go kick the tires.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.800
Go grab that $100 and support the show.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.880
Linode.com slash unplugged.

15:43.880 --> 15:50.660
That's Linode.com slash unplugged.

15:50.660 --> 15:52.400
We have some housekeeping today.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.160
Yeah, I'm excited about some of this.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.640
Let's start with the new drop, Brent.

15:56.640 --> 16:00.640
On your way home, you had an opportunity to hide another geocache.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.120
I did, and I had a lot of fun with it.

16:03.120 --> 16:07.440
Those who've been paying attention, I drove home from the studio this week.

16:07.440 --> 16:10.920
And while I was driving, most of the time I was like, where am I going to drop this

16:10.920 --> 16:12.800
last geocache?

16:12.800 --> 16:16.780
Because we didn't really have a plan for it, but we thought that somewhere along Brent's

16:16.780 --> 16:19.240
journey might be the way to go.

16:19.240 --> 16:25.040
And Chris, you recommended that I stop at this location called the Washington Pass Overlook.

16:25.040 --> 16:27.600
And I think you totally nailed it.

16:27.600 --> 16:32.640
With the trees changing, with the season changing, it was a beautiful stop.

16:32.640 --> 16:36.120
And I thought, I think this is the perfect spot.

16:36.120 --> 16:43.160
Well, I am here at the North Washington Pass Overlook, which is a beautiful spot.

16:43.160 --> 16:46.080
Thank you, Chris, for mentioning it.

16:46.080 --> 16:53.360
And I've made my way, let's say, off the beaten path just a little.

16:53.360 --> 17:01.000
And the views from here are gorgeous, and I just found a nice little spot to tuck our

17:01.000 --> 17:08.560
little geocache for those who are adventurous enough to come here and have a look on one

17:08.560 --> 17:12.280
of the steps that are made by nature.

17:12.280 --> 17:13.280
It's a beautiful spot.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.600
I hope you make your way out.

17:15.600 --> 17:19.960
Just know, there isn't really any internet out here, so you might have to work a little

17:19.960 --> 17:22.120
harder to find the coordinates.

17:22.120 --> 17:26.960
But good luck, and let us know if you found it.

17:26.960 --> 17:30.720
We got to watch the video version of this, which is in the Jupiter tube recording.

17:30.720 --> 17:35.160
And every camera frame looks like a wallpaper background.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.600
Such a beautiful spot.

17:36.600 --> 17:40.080
I like to go there on a hot day, just because it's up high in the elevation, and just get

17:40.080 --> 17:42.360
some fresh air, although it's all smoky right now.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.040
What do you mean a nature step?

17:44.040 --> 17:45.040
What is a nature step?

17:45.040 --> 17:49.520
There's like, well, I don't want to give too much away, but there's this like, you know,

17:49.520 --> 17:54.800
of course, I went off the path of where they want you to actually walk, and I'm not the

17:54.800 --> 17:55.800
first to do that.

17:55.800 --> 17:59.320
There was a little like, worn out trail, you know, it looked like a game trail or something,

17:59.320 --> 18:01.640
but it's clearly people just getting a different view.

18:01.640 --> 18:03.840
So, rule breakers only for this cache.

18:03.840 --> 18:04.840
Right?

18:04.840 --> 18:05.840
And so the infrastructure there is great.

18:05.840 --> 18:09.360
They've got it all, you know, all the paths are paved, and there's railings.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.360
Easy parking.

18:10.360 --> 18:15.040
Yeah, it's actually great, but you know, you got to trek off of that path from time

18:15.040 --> 18:16.040
to time.

18:16.040 --> 18:22.360
And if you do decide to do that, there's like, these large rock formations that feel like

18:22.360 --> 18:27.560
natural steps down to this other view that I got to take and it was beautiful.

18:27.560 --> 18:28.920
And I didn't have to be around people.

18:28.920 --> 18:32.540
I mean, there weren't that many people and everybody was really nice, but it just felt

18:32.540 --> 18:34.700
for a moment like it was just me up there.

18:34.700 --> 18:39.380
And so one of these natural steps, that's kind of where you want to look.

18:39.380 --> 18:42.160
We learned a new French Canadian translation today.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.160
Natural step?

18:43.160 --> 18:44.160
Yeah, that's rocks.

18:44.160 --> 18:48.280
That's a destination, really.

18:48.280 --> 18:51.400
If you visit the state of Washington, that's a destination.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.400
And Highway 20 is a drive.

18:53.400 --> 18:57.600
And why not top it off with a little JB Geocache?

18:57.600 --> 19:01.680
So we've got one that's been discovered and three out, or do we have four out in the wild

19:01.680 --> 19:02.680
right now?

19:02.680 --> 19:03.680
Yeah.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.280
I guess we're supposed to be keeping track of this.

19:06.280 --> 19:08.920
I think it's three.

19:08.920 --> 19:12.600
The one in the one at the power station has been found.

19:12.600 --> 19:13.600
No.

19:13.600 --> 19:14.600
Has it?

19:14.600 --> 19:15.600
Yeah.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.600
Wasn't it?

19:16.600 --> 19:17.600
That was the power station.

19:17.600 --> 19:18.600
Yeah.

19:18.600 --> 19:21.840
The Pasadena at the at the hydro plant that had been shut down.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.840
No, that was in somewhere else.

19:23.840 --> 19:29.400
This is perhaps a perfect segue into an idea I had this week that I'm looking to get feedback

19:29.400 --> 19:30.400
from.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.400
That was in Folsom.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.400
Oh, Folsom.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.400
Right.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.400
Which is right.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.400
Right.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.400
Not Pasadena.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.400
Yeah, you're right.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.400
It's more closer to Sacramento.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.400
My bad.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.400
Get your California straight.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.400
I know.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.400
So we have one Geocache in Folsom hasn't been found.

19:42.400 --> 19:46.940
We have one Geocache in Grants Pass has also not been found.

19:46.940 --> 19:48.320
We have the one I just dropped.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.400
That's three.

19:50.400 --> 19:51.640
I think that's it.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.600
I think we need Hidia here to keep us straight.

19:53.600 --> 19:58.920
But an idea I had this week to kind of keep track of all this is I wondered what you both

19:58.920 --> 20:05.600
think and what the audience thinks of having a more permanent JB Geocaching tracker.

20:05.600 --> 20:09.480
I was thinking it might be fun for audience members to drop some and for us to have sort

20:09.480 --> 20:15.460
of a list and even, you know, which ones have been found, locations that you could go looking

20:15.460 --> 20:17.840
for them just sort of all over the world.

20:17.840 --> 20:19.520
It doesn't have to be us dropping them all the time.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.120
I thought that might be a little fun.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.040
If people were into it, I would totally like that.

20:24.040 --> 20:26.320
We got to see because we got Geocache although these are only in the West Coast.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.240
If we could get them spread out and get the audience involved.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.000
Yeah, I could see what you're saying.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
That could be fun.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.800
And maybe we could partner up to you know, people are willing to if they've got some

20:33.800 --> 20:34.800
stuff that's great.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.280
Maybe we could like send them some swag from time to time.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.720
Help help spread things.

20:38.720 --> 20:39.720
Definitely.

20:39.720 --> 20:40.720
Yeah, help them stock it.

20:40.720 --> 20:44.160
And I did notice that some of the meetups that there were some gear exchange happening

20:44.160 --> 20:46.800
and I thought might be a different way of doing that as well.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.420
That does happen a lot.

20:48.420 --> 20:49.640
People bring gear to the meetups.

20:49.640 --> 20:54.240
So I was wandering around in the woods and there's just like a server rack out here.

20:54.240 --> 20:58.800
Something that happens too is and I understand because I can be this way is people have like

20:58.800 --> 21:02.240
this really cool piece of gear or nice piece of gear that they don't want to they don't

21:02.240 --> 21:03.240
want to throw out.

21:03.240 --> 21:06.520
So they bring it to give it to me, but I'm often like on the road and don't really have

21:06.520 --> 21:07.520
room for it.

21:07.520 --> 21:13.160
It's like a tricky thing and it's sometimes I accept but it's he always takes pies though.

21:13.160 --> 21:16.800
But we've had you know, we've had boxes left behind with stuff in them and like, oh, OK.

21:16.800 --> 21:17.800
All right.

21:17.800 --> 21:18.800
You can leave that here.

21:18.800 --> 21:19.800
I guess that's fine.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.120
But where do we organize this this idea?

21:22.120 --> 21:24.080
Maybe in the matrix room somewhere in the J.B. chat.

21:24.080 --> 21:29.600
Well, I was thinking something maybe a bit more official or more technical way.

21:29.600 --> 21:30.600
Let me guess.

21:30.600 --> 21:31.600
Let me guess.

21:31.600 --> 21:32.600
No, no, don't guess.

21:32.600 --> 21:33.600
Yeah, you'll get it right.

21:33.600 --> 21:34.600
It's going to be GitHub.

21:34.600 --> 21:35.600
It's going to be GitHub, isn't it?

21:35.600 --> 21:36.600
But I don't know if that's the right place.

21:36.600 --> 21:40.320
I mean, I'm, yeah, new to it and excited about GitHub and I'm liking the way it's working.

21:40.320 --> 21:42.240
But is that really the right the right place?

21:42.240 --> 21:43.560
Brands got himself a hammer.

21:43.560 --> 21:46.200
Well, but maybe it's just a page on our website.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.200
Right.

21:47.200 --> 21:53.520
And if you drop a new geocache, then you make a new PR to add that information to our website.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.520
That could be a way to do it.

21:54.520 --> 21:57.040
Sounds like it's I need some brainstorming, but I like the idea.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.880
Yeah, that's that's really the step I'm at.

21:58.880 --> 21:59.880
So I need help.

21:59.880 --> 22:00.880
All right.

22:00.880 --> 22:05.040
So but let's let's I think you start maybe in the website chat room.

22:05.040 --> 22:07.440
I mean, you need somewhere to you need somewhere to organize this.

22:07.440 --> 22:10.000
I think we need we might want a matrix chat about it anyway.

22:10.000 --> 22:13.680
We need a temperature gauge to know if this is something people are interested in, I think.

22:13.680 --> 22:18.120
Because right now we've got three caches out there that nobody's even gone out and snagged

22:18.120 --> 22:22.760
up, which should indicate to me low to moderate interest.

22:22.760 --> 22:26.040
But perhaps it's just location specific or those are very well hidden.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.120
I don't know.

22:27.120 --> 22:30.740
Or maybe what we should do is a marketing campaign where we just start finding other

22:30.740 --> 22:33.900
geocaches and putting our stickers in there.

22:33.900 --> 22:37.600
I think you're on to something like guerrilla marketing shows canceled next week.

22:37.600 --> 22:41.280
We're going to be out cash on just bring a microphone with us.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.900
We're here from this field.

22:43.900 --> 22:51.480
We think there's something here.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.860
Johnny comes in again as our baller booster.

22:53.860 --> 22:57.800
We like to feature the folks that are supporting this episode significantly with their boost

22:57.800 --> 23:05.320
contribution and he comes in with 22,504 sets and he says these boosts are real and they're

23:05.320 --> 23:06.320
spectacular.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.320
It's great.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.320
Seinfeld reference.

23:08.320 --> 23:09.320
Mm hmm.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.320
Seinfeld reference acknowledged.

23:10.320 --> 23:14.760
And he goes on to say not to complain guys, but by the way, this is actually my ninth

23:14.760 --> 23:16.800
consecutive episode where I've boosted.

23:16.800 --> 23:17.800
Just saying.

23:17.800 --> 23:21.600
I think this is I think he and I have two different counts.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.080
I'm counting the baller boost run, which seems unsustainable.

23:25.080 --> 23:28.680
And I noticed I noticed John's playing around with the numbers a little bit, trying to get

23:28.680 --> 23:32.660
in just above what he figures is the baller threshold.

23:32.660 --> 23:35.640
So what we really need is somebody to come in and like throw him a curveball and see

23:35.640 --> 23:38.200
if he can maintain his streak.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.200
But all right.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.200
We'll say this is your 10th.

23:40.200 --> 23:43.760
I was going to say, yeah, I mean, at this point, I'll just accept whatever John's number

23:43.760 --> 23:44.760
is.

23:44.760 --> 23:45.760
It's totally fine.

23:45.760 --> 23:50.680
At this point, John gets to say, all right, so this is his 10th consecutive boost, which

23:50.680 --> 23:56.120
I feel like that 10 in a row is like, we got to give him some sort of trophy or something,

23:56.120 --> 23:57.120
some sort of swag item.

23:57.120 --> 24:01.520
John, you got to contact me on Matrix or something and we'll figure something out.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.360
There are three geocaches you can choose from.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.360
Yeah, right.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.360
There you go.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.360
OK, very good.

24:06.360 --> 24:09.720
We've hidden, pre-hidden your trophy for you, no problem.

24:09.720 --> 24:13.160
Gene Bean boosted in with 20,000 sats.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.560
I hoard that which your kind covet.

24:15.560 --> 24:18.960
He says there's plenty of places in Carlton.

24:18.960 --> 24:22.480
There's also the west side of Atlanta that might fit your idea of being able to host

24:22.480 --> 24:24.320
a podcast on site.

24:24.320 --> 24:29.920
Y'all would likely want to fly to Atlanta, though, as I've made that drive and it's long.

24:29.920 --> 24:32.440
Yeah, I do picture us kind of flying.

24:32.440 --> 24:36.160
So just to recap what people are, if you're out of the loop from what Gene Bean is talking

24:36.160 --> 24:39.400
about, we're done with these road trips that we've been doing traditionally.

24:39.400 --> 24:43.920
I think they they worked in an era where no events were going on.

24:43.920 --> 24:47.700
But they've been hard and arduous and technically challenging and expensive.

24:47.700 --> 24:52.580
So what I want to do is shift to a venue based approach where we do live shows at a venue.

24:52.580 --> 24:54.000
People come, they see the show.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.860
Ideally, there'd be like a ticket that's cheap enough to cover our cost to fly out there

24:57.860 --> 25:01.800
and do the show, but not so expensive that it's prohibited for people to visit.

25:01.800 --> 25:04.740
And I think we're probably we would start as we would want to maybe, unless somebody

25:04.740 --> 25:07.800
had a great venue in mind, I think we'd want to pick a couple of venues to start with to

25:07.800 --> 25:08.800
practice.

25:08.800 --> 25:14.680
Maybe we would do it at an event like a Linux fest or a scale to learn like the ropes.

25:14.680 --> 25:18.480
And then actually start doing a production that has tickets and things like that.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.480
Kind of bring a microphone for each of the hosts.

25:20.480 --> 25:21.480
OK.

25:21.480 --> 25:22.480
Yeah, right.

25:22.480 --> 25:23.480
I got to figure that out.

25:23.480 --> 25:26.960
Gene Bean, followed up with a set of stats, said, gee, I really wonder how Chris feels

25:26.960 --> 25:28.200
about the whole Fedora fiasco.

25:28.200 --> 25:32.720
Guess why I didn't make my feelings clear about the whole patent thing.

25:32.720 --> 25:33.720
Still bummed about it.

25:33.720 --> 25:34.720
Still bummed about it.

25:34.720 --> 25:35.720
It's really it's really unfortunate.

25:35.720 --> 25:38.960
The whole patent situation is extremely unfortunate, I have to say.

25:38.960 --> 25:41.840
You say you're only going to watch H265 encodings from now on.

25:41.840 --> 25:42.840
Right.

25:42.840 --> 25:43.840
Very particular.

25:43.840 --> 25:47.440
I'm going to kick off that old FFmpeg script that's just converting everything to WebM

25:47.440 --> 25:51.160
because clearly VP8 is our only future.

25:51.160 --> 25:56.560
Did you see that there's a patent shark getting a bunch of buying up a bunch of small patents

25:56.560 --> 25:59.860
and stuff getting together to go after Opus players?

25:59.860 --> 26:03.720
And Opus was specifically designed to avoid patent issues.

26:03.720 --> 26:08.080
I guess they claim they're focusing on like people shipping hardware encoders and stuff.

26:08.080 --> 26:09.080
Yeah.

26:09.080 --> 26:10.080
We'll see.

26:10.080 --> 26:13.600
Well, even then, though, if all of a sudden people you know, if the word gets out that

26:13.600 --> 26:16.340
if you ship Opus on your hardware player, you're going to get a knock on a door from

26:16.340 --> 26:17.340
a patent troll.

26:17.340 --> 26:20.760
Well, the easy way to solve that is just don't ship Opus.

26:20.760 --> 26:24.040
And it's not like there's a there's not like there's an organization that can go get a

26:24.040 --> 26:26.920
patent from patent license from, I don't think.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.120
So that's really unfortunate.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.160
And it's a problem that isn't going to get any better.

26:30.160 --> 26:35.720
I think what at the core of it, what really bothers me about it is that I guess I kind

26:35.720 --> 26:41.920
of think like as Linux users, as we put up with things like the Nvidia driver or proprietary

26:41.920 --> 26:47.200
codecs and then we kind of over time, we build these solutions to solve that problem, to

26:47.200 --> 26:52.480
make it more approachable to more users, something that can be done, you know, across distros

26:52.480 --> 26:53.480
or something like that.

26:53.480 --> 26:57.380
And it feels like a win and it feels like we've stepped forward, we've made progress.

26:57.380 --> 27:03.640
And what this feels like is, oh, actually, that progress can be undone at any moment

27:03.640 --> 27:09.200
because Red Hat Legal just didn't understand how this worked before and now realizes that

27:09.200 --> 27:12.480
they're, oh, choosing to ship this stuff, so we have to be careful.

27:12.480 --> 27:17.680
And so because their perception of the situation changed, we're now undoing progress.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.720
And it just makes me wonder, well, what's next?

27:19.720 --> 27:23.480
You know, what happens if somebody starts going after Wi-Fi drivers and now decides

27:23.480 --> 27:27.040
that the Intel driver violates some sort of patent and the people that are using the Intel

27:27.040 --> 27:30.840
Wi-Fi driver need a license, something that, you know, Intel ripped off from them or something

27:30.840 --> 27:31.840
like where does it end?

27:31.840 --> 27:33.120
When does it stop?

27:33.120 --> 27:37.640
And it made me realize that the progress that the Linux desktop gets is fragile and that

27:37.640 --> 27:44.920
it can be undone by hyper-protective, hyper-proactive legal departments at an influential distribution.

27:44.920 --> 27:48.360
And as a Linux user, I find that sad and frustrating.

27:48.360 --> 27:52.380
But at the end of the day, there's lots of choice.

27:52.380 --> 27:56.440
It continues to be the number one thing our audience mentioned at our meetups and it continues

27:56.440 --> 27:57.440
to be true.

27:57.440 --> 28:02.440
The choice is both Linux's weakness in terms of fragmentation and frame of development

28:02.440 --> 28:05.400
time and it's also its strength.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.760
And you know, in this case, it's a strength.

28:08.760 --> 28:09.760
Still better than Windows.

28:09.760 --> 28:10.760
That's right.

28:10.760 --> 28:11.760
That's right.

28:11.760 --> 28:16.960
So thank you Gene Bean and thank you John A. for your baller boost this episode.

28:16.960 --> 28:22.360
We really appreciate it.

28:22.360 --> 28:26.200
The contributions in the boost have been really significant because you may have seen in the

28:26.200 --> 28:32.280
last week PayPal had a user license or a user, not a license, what are they called?

28:32.280 --> 28:33.280
I guess agreement.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.320
They call it like a EUL or something like that.

28:35.320 --> 28:36.680
An end user agreement perhaps?

28:36.680 --> 28:40.480
Yeah, it's basically like a EULA, but they have a different name for it.

28:40.480 --> 28:47.240
And they updated it saying that they were going to fine users $2,500 if they spread

28:47.240 --> 28:51.720
misinformation online and if you don't have $2,500 in your PayPal account, no problem.

28:51.720 --> 28:55.400
They'll just automatically debit it from whatever accounts you do have connected.

28:55.400 --> 28:59.400
And of course, PayPal is the arbiter of what is misinformation and where it matters and

28:59.400 --> 29:01.160
where it doesn't matter.

29:01.160 --> 29:04.040
As a result, there has been a ton of PayPal account closures.

29:04.040 --> 29:08.120
In fact, to the point now where PayPal is paying $15 to people who don't close their

29:08.120 --> 29:09.120
account.

29:09.120 --> 29:12.200
So if you want to free 15 bucks, I don't know how long it's going to last, but they'll pay

29:12.200 --> 29:14.000
you 15 bucks not to close your account right now.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.520
That's how desperate they are.

29:16.520 --> 29:23.360
PayPal though underlies a lot of the payment processing for memberships and automatic contributions.

29:23.360 --> 29:27.720
PayPal is one of the few ways to do a subscription on the back end successfully.

29:27.720 --> 29:33.920
And so a lot of podcasters, JB included, but not as much as some of my other friends have

29:33.920 --> 29:39.680
been negatively impacted by this because when you cancel your PayPal account, you're canceling

29:39.680 --> 29:43.720
that payment to that podcast too, understandably.

29:43.720 --> 29:48.000
And so that's why I'm just very grateful that earlier this year, we did start working on

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
the Boost system.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.840
We did start implementing an alternative that is based on free software, that is decentralized,

29:53.840 --> 29:56.360
that isn't connected to any single company.

29:56.360 --> 30:00.160
And so when we have these baller boosters step up, that is investing in that particular

30:00.160 --> 30:01.160
episode.

30:01.160 --> 30:04.040
And so we have our members, we have a network of members who are there that are investing

30:04.040 --> 30:07.840
in the reoccurring production of the show, making it financially possible that if like

30:07.840 --> 30:11.240
every sponsor pulled out tomorrow, we could still get an episode out, right?

30:11.240 --> 30:13.240
We could still pay for the editor.

30:13.240 --> 30:17.680
That is what the members are doing and it is absolutely essential, UnpluggedCore.com

30:17.680 --> 30:19.680
by the way, or Jupiter.party.

30:19.680 --> 30:24.380
And then the boosters are coming in and they're thanking us for that particular production.

30:24.380 --> 30:27.520
They're transferring their value for that particular production.

30:27.520 --> 30:31.480
And when you see something like PayPal and the moves they're making and then people's

30:31.480 --> 30:36.200
result because they're clearly upset, justifiably so, I am just so grateful for something like

30:36.200 --> 30:40.460
the Lightning Network and the fact that these boosts are app agnostic as well.

30:40.460 --> 30:43.040
So there's just no vendor tie-in, there's no lock-in at all.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.320
So thank you to John A and thank you to Gene Bean.

30:45.320 --> 30:48.640
We'll have more boosts later in the show, but I think this is going to be more important

30:48.640 --> 30:50.920
to podcasters as time goes on.

30:50.920 --> 30:54.760
I could talk about it for hours, but instead I'll save some of that for office hours.

30:54.760 --> 30:56.760
And why don't we move on to the new Thaleo?

30:56.760 --> 31:02.460
The new Thaleo from System76, they shipped us a pre-production unit so we could get our

31:02.460 --> 31:05.780
hands on it early and start doing some testing and then the road trip landed.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.360
So they actually released it while we were on the road trip.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.500
We just didn't have a moment to talk about it.

31:10.500 --> 31:15.520
We want to talk about it today because it's kind of an iconic piece of hardware in its

31:15.520 --> 31:20.040
look, in what it's trying to do performance-wise, its ambition in that regard.

31:20.040 --> 31:23.000
It's kind of the Mac Pro for the Linux crowd.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.840
I don't know if we have a better built, you know, especially when you look at all the

31:26.840 --> 31:30.760
range of Thaleos, there's like five different Thaleos and some of them are just monstrous.

31:30.760 --> 31:35.240
Yeah, I mean, I'm a machine, I don't even know what I would be able to do it with.

31:35.240 --> 31:36.480
Throw all the scripts I have at it.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.480
I know, right?

31:37.480 --> 31:43.120
So what we have in the studio is the smaller of the five Thaleos.

31:43.120 --> 31:49.920
It's the base unit, still pretty rockin', AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, which bursts up to 4.8

31:49.920 --> 31:58.640
gigs, 32 gigabytes of fast RAM, a 1 terabyte Samsung 980 SSD, an NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti with

31:58.640 --> 32:02.800
8 gigs of RAM, and a crap ton of CUDA cores.

32:02.800 --> 32:08.080
And you can get it with AMD or Intel builds, but ours came with the AMD build, obviously.

32:08.080 --> 32:13.160
The size of the base Thaleo on your desk takes up about the size of a sheet of paper.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.160
That's the footprint.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.160
You're talking about like the 8, yeah, the footprint.

32:15.160 --> 32:16.160
Oh, wow, okay.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.160
Not, right?

32:17.160 --> 32:18.160
And I'd say it's about the height.

32:18.160 --> 32:20.920
It's about half the height of a standard ATX.

32:20.920 --> 32:24.360
So it's actually much more compact than the pictures make it look.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.840
That really surprised me.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.280
It's a dense little unit too, right?

32:27.280 --> 32:31.400
Because the whole case is made out of like milled metal and aluminum or whatever.

32:31.400 --> 32:34.080
It's not, I don't think it's aluminum, it's heavy.

32:34.080 --> 32:35.080
Very sturdy.

32:35.080 --> 32:38.440
And System76 has built certain things in there to hold the graphics card in place so it can

32:38.440 --> 32:39.440
withstand shipping.

32:39.440 --> 32:42.000
They've included things like the screws in the case.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.820
They've pre-run all the wiring you'll ever need with wire management.

32:44.820 --> 32:48.800
So if you want to add something, the plug is already there, you just...

32:48.800 --> 32:52.200
Yeah, that part, the maintenance, the expandability bits, that seems very thoughtful.

32:52.200 --> 32:57.480
It's got an impressive amount of room for storage even in this small unit.

32:57.480 --> 33:01.360
So the Thaleo to me kind of feels like one of our hero machines in the Linux community

33:01.360 --> 33:06.060
in terms... and that's kind of, that's a term for like a, you know, kind of like a really

33:06.060 --> 33:08.580
high-end aspirational unit.

33:08.580 --> 33:13.080
And the base price starts at $950 US greenbacks.

33:13.080 --> 33:19.040
Our unit as configured came in around $2,100, $2,200 depending on what you do warranty-wise

33:19.040 --> 33:20.260
and whatnot.

33:20.260 --> 33:23.900
So $2,200 we'll say for our unit.

33:23.900 --> 33:28.520
And I think ours was pretty close to the final production unit with just a couple of tweaks

33:28.520 --> 33:31.120
like to the Wi-Fi and a couple of other small things.

33:31.120 --> 33:34.700
Some brackets here and there that they print and whatnot and of course the parts.

33:34.700 --> 33:37.520
But now they're shipping the full production units.

33:37.520 --> 33:38.560
And we ran ours with Pop!

33:38.560 --> 33:40.840
OS for a little while to get a good sense of that.

33:40.840 --> 33:45.860
And then, oh, I don't know, I think a week or two after some baseline testing, we moved

33:45.860 --> 33:48.460
it over as like a workstation and put Nix on there.

33:48.460 --> 33:53.040
And then towards the end, we started looking at it more as like an OBS live streaming machine

33:53.040 --> 33:55.600
and a deep fusion rendering.

33:55.600 --> 33:56.600
Is that the right way to put that?

33:56.600 --> 34:00.320
Yeah, you know, playing with some machine learning tasks because why not?

34:00.320 --> 34:03.280
When you got a nice graphics card, you got a fancy rig.

34:03.280 --> 34:06.560
It's got a lot of CUDA cores Wes, a lot of CUDA cores.

34:06.560 --> 34:07.560
Yeah.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.280
And that's been a lot of fun.

34:09.280 --> 34:14.600
The challenge for us here is like, how do you really, how do you push something like

34:14.600 --> 34:15.600
this?

34:15.600 --> 34:16.600
Right?

34:16.600 --> 34:20.480
It's got 12 physical cores, 24 virtual cores when they're all turned on.

34:20.480 --> 34:23.720
I mean, that just like takes up your whole HTOP screen just right there, just showing

34:23.720 --> 34:24.720
you all the cores.

34:24.720 --> 34:26.000
You don't even get to the processes.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.480
It's pretty crazy.

34:27.480 --> 34:33.320
And for me, 3060 Ti is like the nicest video card I've had in two years.

34:33.320 --> 34:37.720
And 32 gigs of RAM, well, I can actually use that up, but it's a lot of RAM, it's a lot

34:37.720 --> 34:38.720
of RAM.

34:38.720 --> 34:41.920
So we really wanted to push this thing and we did.

34:41.920 --> 34:46.080
We attached three external monitors to it to kind of really kind of tax the graphical

34:46.080 --> 34:48.000
subsystem with different speeds.

34:48.000 --> 34:53.520
So one in the center was a high refresh rate, high DPI, HDR monitor.

34:53.520 --> 34:59.080
And then we had two 1440p monitors, one vertical, one horizontal.

34:59.080 --> 35:03.520
And it was driving all of those with the Nvidia card as we were doing all of this testing.

35:03.520 --> 35:06.520
And one of the things we'll do, although I'll give you a high level overview, but just so

35:06.520 --> 35:11.560
you know if you're listening, in the notes, we have linked to some openbenchmarking.org

35:11.560 --> 35:18.200
benchmarks for kernel compilation time, 3D graphics performance.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.880
We also did some comparisons between the Dev1 and the Thalia, which I'll talk about in a

35:21.880 --> 35:23.100
little bit.

35:23.100 --> 35:28.400
But if you're curious to know how your system would stack up to this Thalia, if you'd like

35:28.400 --> 35:32.920
to know what kind of performance delta you're looking at, you can go to these links and

35:32.920 --> 35:38.640
there is a command you can copy in there, and you can run your system against the Thalia

35:38.640 --> 35:39.640
and see.

35:39.640 --> 35:42.280
That way I have like an easy thing I can go justify maybe to someone if I need to say

35:42.280 --> 35:46.120
like, look, this is what I got now, it's not cutting that, whether that's a partner or

35:46.120 --> 35:47.120
a boss.

35:47.120 --> 35:49.160
Well, it was interesting with the Dev1, Wes.

35:49.160 --> 35:53.240
You know, so we benchmarked the Dev1 versus the Thalia on a few things.

35:53.240 --> 35:58.440
And I was impressed with how the Dev1 performed, I'll say that.

35:58.440 --> 36:03.360
But it was clear there was a significant time savings for some of this stuff if you went

36:03.360 --> 36:04.360
with the Thalia.

36:04.360 --> 36:07.880
I mean, Brent, I'm curious to know what your impression was if you kind of if you experienced

36:07.880 --> 36:08.880
the same thing.

36:08.880 --> 36:10.440
It's like, wow, there's a big delta here.

36:10.440 --> 36:14.240
But practically speaking, it makes sense for the price of the units.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.560
I think it really depends on your workload likely.

36:16.560 --> 36:23.120
Like I was looking at it from a desktop users workload, not necessarily someone who's doing,

36:23.120 --> 36:26.480
you know, machine learning and all that kind of fancy stuff that I don't know how to do

36:26.480 --> 36:27.480
yet.

36:27.480 --> 36:33.440
But it seemed to me from that perspective, that it was surprisingly close.

36:33.440 --> 36:37.080
You know, we also in our comparisons had my old x 250 in there.

36:37.080 --> 36:40.040
So I think that adds perspective a little bit.

36:40.040 --> 36:43.040
It was lagging far, far, far, far, far behind.

36:43.040 --> 36:44.040
But we knew that.

36:44.040 --> 36:48.560
But it was interesting to add that to the comparisons, because then it became maybe

36:48.560 --> 36:56.720
a bit less of a massive jump in advantage to having the Thalia versus the Dev1 for certain

36:56.720 --> 36:57.720
modes.

36:57.720 --> 37:01.520
And more of like, I want to be careful with saying this, but like slightly diminishing

37:01.520 --> 37:06.180
returns in that, if you're really going to push it, well, that thing can do amazing things.

37:06.180 --> 37:12.840
But if you don't need the whole performance gamut, maybe the Dev1 is actually a surprisingly

37:12.840 --> 37:13.840
good machine.

37:13.840 --> 37:17.600
Yeah, I think it speaks to how far laptops have come.

37:17.600 --> 37:21.400
Yeah, especially the AMD laptop stack is very impressive.

37:21.400 --> 37:25.400
The Thalia if you're buying this, you're buying it for a high end workload.

37:25.400 --> 37:29.360
Like this is the kind of machine where you can have a kernel build going or you can have

37:29.360 --> 37:34.080
something building in the background, while you're also running all of your regular applications

37:34.080 --> 37:36.840
and maybe you fire up a quick game to kill a few minutes.

37:36.840 --> 37:39.560
Kind of thing you get so you just don't have to think about the computer performance for

37:39.560 --> 37:40.560
the most part, right?

37:40.560 --> 37:42.640
It's essentially unlimited.

37:42.640 --> 37:47.180
And if you like that idea, the Thalia might be worth the $2,200.

37:47.180 --> 37:53.000
I'll tell you what, like multiple times, Brent and I had a YouTube video playing, software

37:53.000 --> 37:59.320
building in the background and the highest end games we could possibly find on Steam

37:59.320 --> 38:01.480
and the games we could run under wine or whatnot.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.480
Going at the same time.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.240
Let me see how this testing went down now, okay.

38:04.240 --> 38:07.520
There were at times multiple games being played somehow.

38:07.520 --> 38:08.880
We managed to figure that one out.

38:08.880 --> 38:16.600
I had Zonotic going and I can't remember the Zelda knockoff PC game that we were playing,

38:16.600 --> 38:18.680
but a very high end looking game.

38:18.680 --> 38:21.440
And while we also had Zonotic going on one of the monitors, while we also had a software

38:21.440 --> 38:22.440
build going.

38:22.440 --> 38:25.360
The Hashcat too, I think was running at the same time in certain cases.

38:25.360 --> 38:29.840
I mean, you can really push this thing and you know, it will use power.

38:29.840 --> 38:34.200
I think when we really, what we were attempting to replicate, we weren't just like being silly.

38:34.200 --> 38:37.520
I mean, we were kind of having fun too, but what we really wanted to replicate is we wanted

38:37.520 --> 38:39.840
to stress several of the subsystems at once.

38:39.840 --> 38:43.200
We really wanted to stress the GPU and the CPU simultaneously.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.680
I'll tell you why here in a moment.

38:45.680 --> 38:51.920
But while we were doing all of this, the unit's taken, you know, just over 300 watts of power.

38:51.920 --> 38:56.340
We ran this thing continuously on a monitor so that way we could chart its power usage

38:56.340 --> 38:58.780
over the entire time we've had it.

38:58.780 --> 39:03.960
And there's clear differences in sustained workloads and in just sort of idle, you know,

39:03.960 --> 39:05.320
just doing day-to-day office stuff.

39:05.320 --> 39:07.960
There's about 180 to 200 watt difference.

39:07.960 --> 39:10.000
So you can tell when you're using it.

39:10.000 --> 39:16.640
Man, when that Nvidia card lights up, oh boy, it's a whole other, it's a minimum of like

39:16.640 --> 39:18.240
another 100 watts of power that thing draws.

39:18.240 --> 39:20.260
So that Nvidia card is powerful.

39:20.260 --> 39:26.060
That brings me to my point that I think this Thalio unit probably suffers from more so

39:26.060 --> 39:29.000
than all of the other larger Thalios.

39:29.000 --> 39:33.800
And that was thermals because Brent, we spent a lot of time digging through the thermal

39:33.800 --> 39:38.360
performance on this when we were stressing the GPU and the CPU at the same time.

39:38.360 --> 39:43.640
Yeah, I think that's really what we wanted to discover was can it sustain those kinds

39:43.640 --> 39:44.640
of workloads?

39:44.640 --> 39:47.480
You know, okay, we're playing two video games at the same time.

39:47.480 --> 39:51.560
Maybe that's not realistic, but we did do some actual real workloads that you could

39:51.560 --> 39:59.480
see someone doing and it was really fascinating to watch how the Thalio reacted in terms of

39:59.480 --> 40:01.480
keeping itself cool.

40:01.480 --> 40:07.000
And I think we were pretty surprised that it had to really make some major changes to

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
keep those temperatures down.

40:08.000 --> 40:13.920
You know, if you're stressing the GPU, it just, the CPU has just dropped dramatically

40:13.920 --> 40:19.080
to try to maintain, I guess, order inside that case.

40:19.080 --> 40:26.240
And we did experience certain, maybe borderline alarming properties about the case.

40:26.240 --> 40:31.480
One of them, which you and I were both surprised by, was just how, I'm going to say hot, I'm

40:31.480 --> 40:36.520
not going to say warm, I'm going to say how hot the case got when that thing was really

40:36.520 --> 40:42.160
being pushed for, I think it would take maybe like 10 minutes for it to get to that point.

40:42.160 --> 40:43.160
What'd you say, Chris?

40:43.160 --> 40:46.480
Yeah, 10 minutes of really pushing.

40:46.480 --> 40:47.480
Really pushing.

40:47.480 --> 40:51.440
CPU, GPU, and disk and really giving it the onion.

40:51.440 --> 40:56.440
And what you have is the primary air intake on that Thalio.

40:56.440 --> 40:57.440
This is my supposition.

40:57.440 --> 41:02.360
I don't know if this is actually the problem, but my theory is the primary air intake is

41:02.360 --> 41:04.520
on the very bottom of the case.

41:04.520 --> 41:07.600
And so if you've got some carpet, that may interfere a little bit with air flow.

41:07.600 --> 41:11.600
So we put it up on a flat surface, it does have some nice feet to give it a little bit

41:11.600 --> 41:12.600
of distance.

41:12.600 --> 41:20.200
And that air gets blown up past the PSU and blows through the GPU and it blows through

41:20.200 --> 41:26.680
the intake of the GPU, nicely done, and the GPU, it actually stays relatively cool, comparatively.

41:26.680 --> 41:32.640
But then that GPU and that air continues up into the CPU intake.

41:32.640 --> 41:35.940
And I imagine some of it's getting blown out the back of the GPU, but some of that hot

41:35.940 --> 41:39.400
air is being pulled into the CPU cooler.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.800
And so it's starting with a pretty high temperature.

41:41.800 --> 41:48.840
And what we witnessed was we'd see it clamp down to about two-ish gigahertz, 2.2 gigahertz.

41:48.840 --> 41:52.840
So we weren't getting anywhere near 4.8 for sustained workloads.

41:52.840 --> 41:55.840
Now for bursty things, this wasn't really a problem.

41:55.840 --> 42:01.200
But sustained workloads, you could watch the CPU speed is just kind of drop.

42:01.200 --> 42:07.920
Now, practically speaking, if I had done this workload and didn't have frequency monitors

42:07.920 --> 42:11.880
running and temperature monitors running, I'd have no idea.

42:11.880 --> 42:16.560
You don't really notice it because you've got 12 cores at like 2.2 gigahertz or whatever,

42:16.560 --> 42:19.020
whatever it's throttled to, like 2.2 is worst case.

42:19.020 --> 42:20.880
Sometimes it's up in three, right?

42:20.880 --> 42:23.640
You've got 12 of them and you've got 24 virtual threads.

42:23.640 --> 42:24.640
And they're still going.

42:24.640 --> 42:29.240
So you wouldn't notice it until Linux gives up the ghost, because sometimes if you stress

42:29.240 --> 42:33.720
the disk, the GPU, the CPU, and the networking, you really push it, sometimes Linux gives

42:33.720 --> 42:34.940
up the ghost.

42:34.940 --> 42:39.760
And you do notice it then, but there is thermal throttling that's happening in this unit.

42:39.760 --> 42:44.060
And I would imagine if you got one without a honker of a video card in there, you might

42:44.060 --> 42:45.520
be a little better off.

42:45.520 --> 42:48.020
If you don't need that honker, maybe don't do it.

42:48.020 --> 42:50.440
But we did double check everything.

42:50.440 --> 42:56.540
And everything was within the specs of like the RAM, the CPU, the GPU, the motherboard,

42:56.540 --> 43:00.780
the Northbridge, because we got one of those little laser guns and checked everything.

43:00.780 --> 43:05.160
And everything was within the upper limits of the thermal specs.

43:05.160 --> 43:11.080
And if you're not absolutely pushing the GPU and the CPU to their max consistently, it's

43:11.080 --> 43:12.680
not as much of a problem.

43:12.680 --> 43:17.080
And if you're just looking for bursty performance, you're going to get everything that AMD has

43:17.080 --> 43:18.080
to offer.

43:18.080 --> 43:19.980
I mean, it really does perform.

43:19.980 --> 43:25.060
But it led us like just a little uneasy about the temperatures.

43:25.060 --> 43:26.720
And so we kept an eye on that.

43:26.720 --> 43:31.640
We chatted with System76 about it, and I think for the most part, you're probably within

43:31.640 --> 43:33.560
the limits of what's OK.

43:33.560 --> 43:36.440
I was slightly worried about it, but you'd probably be all right.

43:36.440 --> 43:42.000
This morning, though, well, this morning, things changed and not for the better.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.040
I wish I could have just captured it happening.

43:44.040 --> 43:46.680
I'll try to describe what I saw briefly.

43:46.680 --> 43:50.520
So the system was booting after being powered off at the smart switch, because there's a

43:50.520 --> 43:54.720
smart switch down there that it isn't currently plugged into as a troubleshooting technique.

43:54.720 --> 43:59.840
But the entire time we've had it, we've had it plugged into this smart plug for power

43:59.840 --> 44:02.060
monitoring so we can get historical power monitoring.

44:02.060 --> 44:04.200
That smart plug got turned off last night.

44:04.200 --> 44:07.760
Otherwise, I think the system's been running for days.

44:07.760 --> 44:11.980
When I turned it back on this morning, the LED light lit up around the little button

44:11.980 --> 44:16.060
like it normally does that indicates that it has power, but it's off.

44:16.060 --> 44:20.320
You press that and then it gets bright and the system powers up.

44:20.320 --> 44:22.160
That begins to happen.

44:22.160 --> 44:29.400
As the system is booting, the light turned off on the LED power light.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.800
It just turned off.

44:31.800 --> 44:33.400
The fans were still running.

44:33.400 --> 44:36.940
I could see LED lights reflecting out from the bottom of the case from like the graphics

44:36.940 --> 44:43.360
card internally, but the LED power light was out.

44:43.360 --> 44:48.200
So I flipped the power off on the back of the power supply, flipped it back on, and

44:48.200 --> 44:54.240
now it just doesn't boot, which sort of stinks because this was going to do our live stream

44:54.240 --> 44:58.240
today.

44:58.240 --> 45:02.200
I've tried turning it on and off on the back of the power supply.

45:02.200 --> 45:10.320
I've moved it out of the smart plug and I've left it unplugged for a bit, and nothing.

45:10.320 --> 45:17.560
So it seems on its last morning of duty, well, it eats the duty.

45:17.560 --> 45:19.520
I'm not really sure what happened.

45:19.520 --> 45:24.040
I actually haven't even had time to contact System76 support yet because I was going up

45:24.040 --> 45:28.760
there to grab it this morning thinking that we'll use it down here in the studio today

45:28.760 --> 45:33.000
because we've been experimenting with OBS on there as well, and I just had that issue.

45:33.000 --> 45:37.680
Now we do have a pre-production unit I should mention, and so that could be a factor here,

45:37.680 --> 45:40.440
and there could be something with the button.

45:40.440 --> 45:42.960
So the case has the button integrated into it.

45:42.960 --> 45:47.480
It is a hell of a power button, and when you slide the case up, it disconnects, and when

45:47.480 --> 45:51.180
you slide the case down, it seats into a little connector.

45:51.180 --> 45:55.920
We haven't moved it, but it's possible, like maybe that got loose or disconnected.

45:55.920 --> 45:59.680
So I'm going to play with that after the show, and obviously I'm going to let System76 know

45:59.680 --> 46:00.680
about it too.

46:00.680 --> 46:04.680
You know, if a machine is going to have issues, it's probably within the first month or so.

46:04.680 --> 46:09.120
First hundred days of usage is probably when it's going to fail, or it's like after five

46:09.120 --> 46:10.120
years.

46:10.120 --> 46:11.920
It's like one of those two times, right?

46:11.920 --> 46:15.800
As a desktop, I would love it in here.

46:15.800 --> 46:19.760
As an OBS machine, I think it would just make an excellent OBS machine.

46:19.760 --> 46:24.600
I don't know if I would need a 3060 Ti.

46:24.600 --> 46:26.160
We could probably get away with an ARC.

46:26.160 --> 46:27.160
Exactly.

46:27.160 --> 46:28.160
Exactly.

46:28.160 --> 46:32.280
We could probably get away with like a $280 ARC that would, I would hope, do like quick

46:32.280 --> 46:37.800
sync and OBS would support, and you put something like that in a Thalia, that would also drop

46:37.800 --> 46:44.240
the price by like $700 because these GPUs are crazy, and now you've got yourself a serious

46:44.240 --> 46:47.600
OBS alternative because our hardware is falling apart.

46:47.600 --> 46:52.800
I like how there's this world now where you could have like you're getting an AMD CPU

46:52.800 --> 46:54.600
with your Intel GPU.

46:54.600 --> 46:56.920
Westman, you are blowing my mind.

46:56.920 --> 46:58.920
You're right.

46:58.920 --> 47:04.760
2022, you crazy cat, but I like the setup, although maybe you would want to go all Intel.

47:04.760 --> 47:08.120
I mean, the 12th gen CPUs aren't so bad.

47:08.120 --> 47:11.160
Maybe you would just go all Intel, Intel ARC, Intel CPU.

47:11.160 --> 47:17.240
I think that would make a compelling OBS machine, and I might, I don't know, I might, I might

47:17.240 --> 47:18.240
do it.

47:18.240 --> 47:19.240
I haven't decided yet.

47:19.240 --> 47:22.760
I kind of like the idea of, you know, it is a very handsome looking machine.

47:22.760 --> 47:25.080
I really wouldn't mind having it sort of right on the desk.

47:25.080 --> 47:26.080
It's okay.

47:26.080 --> 47:28.040
It looks fine, and it looks nice in an office.

47:28.040 --> 47:30.240
It's something that looks good in the studio.

47:30.240 --> 47:33.720
I wouldn't mind having it in studio, which is a cool looking piece of hardware.

47:33.720 --> 47:34.720
Yep.

47:34.720 --> 47:40.680
And you know, our little hiccup aside, you know, System76 machines, they seem to last.

47:40.680 --> 47:44.680
Like I would be confident, like if we did that go that direction, I think it could,

47:44.680 --> 47:46.680
you know, I could fill that role for a long time.

47:46.680 --> 47:47.680
Yeah.

47:47.680 --> 47:49.360
One of the things about using the Thalios, I felt like, well, I don't know if I ever

47:49.360 --> 47:52.480
want to build in my own computer again, because I'm never going to have a case this good,

47:52.480 --> 47:54.680
and everything just fits together really well.

47:54.680 --> 47:57.640
I mean, we've seen them build it, and they definitely do a better job than I do when

47:57.640 --> 47:59.400
I'm putting computers together.

47:59.400 --> 48:02.800
That also influences my thought process a little bit, as we've been to the factory,

48:02.800 --> 48:06.000
we've been on the floor, and we've seen the attention to detail assembling this thing,

48:06.000 --> 48:07.760
and how, what a process that is.

48:07.760 --> 48:13.200
And so there's something about having that bespoke made hardware right there in Denver

48:13.200 --> 48:16.360
that is like, obsessed over for quality.

48:16.360 --> 48:20.320
And now this is the next iteration, and they've updated that front panel, so they kind of,

48:20.320 --> 48:25.760
they've removed the, they've removed that wood veneer siding, and they've replaced it

48:25.760 --> 48:27.680
now with just a strip.

48:27.680 --> 48:28.680
And I like it.

48:28.680 --> 48:32.760
I think it looks good, and you can get customized ones, and it's kind of more low key, like

48:32.760 --> 48:37.280
you could have argued that the wood look was a little dated, it was awesome, but it was

48:37.280 --> 48:38.360
a little dated.

48:38.360 --> 48:41.600
And this is a nice way to keep that, it's a nod to that.

48:41.600 --> 48:44.600
But down the road, I think you're gonna be able to get customizable ones.

48:44.600 --> 48:45.600
Can you imagine?

48:45.600 --> 48:46.600
That'd be nice too.

48:46.600 --> 48:49.000
You know, we got a couple different machines here in the studio, you could easily tell

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
them apart.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.920
Oh, you could put their names, like unit one, unit two.

48:51.920 --> 48:53.400
Oh, that's a great idea.

48:53.400 --> 48:54.400
Yeah.

48:54.400 --> 48:59.000
I was thinking, maybe we're at Linux Fest Northwest, and we're live streaming from Linux

48:59.000 --> 49:04.320
Fest, and we've got Athelio up there, and we have in our panel is like the JB logo with

49:04.320 --> 49:06.600
each logo for the show is vertically listed or something.

49:06.600 --> 49:07.600
Oh, yes.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.040
And our website or whatever.

49:09.040 --> 49:11.040
And you could do a little bit of branding on there.

49:11.040 --> 49:12.800
So I think the idea is pretty good.

49:12.800 --> 49:14.040
I think the machine's a good one.

49:14.040 --> 49:18.000
The new case updates are really good to see, it's quieter.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.680
There's been more attention to detail on the back, the ports are labeled in a nice way

49:21.680 --> 49:23.560
that just all just works so well.

49:23.560 --> 49:25.700
It's gotta be the best PC case ever.

49:25.700 --> 49:30.680
I would say that as well, Chris, that case is probably the nicest case I've had my hands

49:30.680 --> 49:36.960
on, and it just felt solid in every way, and it was very organized the way they put it

49:36.960 --> 49:37.960
all together.

49:37.960 --> 49:42.440
So I can't say that enough, like the attention to detail is clear in every step of the way.

49:42.440 --> 49:46.760
So just to wrap it up, we were slightly concerned about the high thermals, but they were within

49:46.760 --> 49:47.760
spec.

49:47.760 --> 49:51.280
I think depending on your build, too, you're going to see different results.

49:51.280 --> 49:53.920
And did they sort of tend to stabilize as the system adjusted?

49:53.920 --> 49:54.920
Yeah.

49:54.920 --> 49:56.600
Yeah, it would just sort of reach a point and then just hold.

49:56.600 --> 49:58.560
That gives me some confidence there, too, you know?

49:58.560 --> 49:59.560
Yeah.

49:59.560 --> 50:04.160
It's like the one step down from the absolute most baller CPU you can put in there.

50:04.160 --> 50:05.720
So that's going to draw power.

50:05.720 --> 50:06.720
It's going to generate heat, right?

50:06.720 --> 50:10.680
It's one step down from the most baller GPU, or one or two steps down from the most baller

50:10.680 --> 50:11.680
GPU.

50:11.680 --> 50:13.380
That's going to generate a bunch of heat.

50:13.380 --> 50:17.200
If you don't need to dial your system up to 11 and you still want that small footprint,

50:17.200 --> 50:18.760
I think you could probably get it real tight.

50:18.760 --> 50:20.520
Ah, you're just telling me to be reasonable.

50:20.520 --> 50:21.520
Okay.

50:21.520 --> 50:24.520
Well, I'm just thinking for our build, like you said, you get it without a GPU, and then

50:24.520 --> 50:27.040
you add an arc.

50:27.040 --> 50:30.280
I mean, that, I think, is the way to go.

50:30.280 --> 50:31.760
I want to go configure one right now.

50:31.760 --> 50:35.480
I'm thinking maybe I should just take a moment and just go build one.

50:35.480 --> 50:36.480
Well, yeah.

50:36.480 --> 50:37.480
I mean, the one we got in the studio is not working.

50:37.480 --> 50:38.480
We need to order one.

50:38.480 --> 50:39.480
I mean, there is that, right?

50:39.480 --> 50:41.480
We don't want an outage or failure.

50:41.480 --> 50:45.600
When did we have to do the Hawk attack on the power supply?

50:45.600 --> 50:49.400
You were here, Brent, so that must have been office hours right before you left.

50:49.400 --> 50:50.640
I have a technique.

50:50.640 --> 50:55.200
When the machines are making noise, you got to listen to them, and depending on the type

50:55.200 --> 50:58.360
of noise, you do a different type of attack.

50:58.360 --> 51:02.480
So if it's a low, almost like throbbing, it almost sounds like a capacitor is about to

51:02.480 --> 51:06.720
pop, but it's really just the fan, you got to make sure it's not the capacitor.

51:06.720 --> 51:08.240
You don't want to attack the capacitor.

51:08.240 --> 51:12.840
What you want to do is a Hawk-like striking attack with your hand, so make your hand look

51:12.840 --> 51:17.640
like a Hawk, and I find if you make the noise, it helps, and then you just want to hit it

51:17.640 --> 51:23.520
fast, like you're pecking it, tap, tap, tap, you know, you tap, tap, tap, like that a couple

51:23.520 --> 51:25.360
of times, and that'll fix that.

51:25.360 --> 51:30.040
But if it's a high-pitched, like louder one, like a grindier one, that's a full fist thump.

51:30.040 --> 51:32.320
You want to do a big old thump-thump on that one.

51:32.320 --> 51:33.320
Sometimes once, sometimes twice.

51:33.320 --> 51:35.920
Now, do you curse as part of this at all?

51:35.920 --> 51:40.720
You curse as you're walking up to it, you know, oh, this gosh darn doing this, but you

51:40.720 --> 51:44.600
know, you put in the right, you know what I'm saying, here it goes again, you know,

51:44.600 --> 51:48.200
you kind of do that kind of a thing, like that's my preferred technique, and then you

51:48.200 --> 51:53.480
just get real focused, get Brent out of the way, and then you just do the Hawk attack.

51:53.480 --> 51:56.000
Yeah, apparently I don't know what I'm doing.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.080
Clearly Chris has to show me how it's done, but...

51:58.080 --> 52:01.000
I think this is what they teach you in the A plus certification, right?

52:01.000 --> 52:06.840
So you know, I used to be a tech, back in my day, that's how we did it, and that'll

52:06.840 --> 52:09.140
work for probably another month or two.

52:09.140 --> 52:12.360
The thing that I like about it is it's clear that like multiple components are failing

52:12.360 --> 52:13.360
too.

52:13.360 --> 52:17.680
It's like the GPU fans can be failing, the CPU fans failing, the PSU fan, yeah.

52:17.680 --> 52:19.160
A lot of variables in play.

52:19.160 --> 52:21.420
You know, who needs that crap anyways, right?

52:21.420 --> 52:26.280
I knew we were in a bad state, but when I got my head down there, I didn't realize just

52:26.280 --> 52:28.640
how in a bad state we are with the studio machines.

52:28.640 --> 52:34.680
The cases are half apart because clearly they've had issues for years, can I say that?

52:34.680 --> 52:36.640
And it's just a mess down there.

52:36.640 --> 52:40.200
I mean, Drew was amazing a few years ago and cleaned up all those cables.

52:40.200 --> 52:41.760
I think it's just a bird's nest again.

52:41.760 --> 52:43.960
Yeah, we need Drew to come back out and clean them all up again.

52:43.960 --> 52:45.920
I don't think it ever happens unless he does it.

52:45.920 --> 52:48.160
Don't tell him, we just gotta get him out here for some pretense.

52:48.160 --> 52:49.720
Yeah, right, right, you're right.

52:49.720 --> 52:52.120
Okay, so I didn't save as much money.

52:52.120 --> 52:56.520
So while we were chatting, I configured one and mine came in at $1,949 actually.

52:56.520 --> 53:01.480
Well, what are we getting for that?

53:01.480 --> 53:04.680
Well here's the thing is I kind of went baller on the storage.

53:04.680 --> 53:08.240
So I upgraded the power supply to make room for that arc.

53:08.240 --> 53:14.160
So it comes with a 450, I upgraded to a 650, which they recommend depending on your GPU.

53:14.160 --> 53:16.000
I went with integrated graphics.

53:16.000 --> 53:21.480
That's where we save the money because upgrading to the GPU I have is a $539 upgrade.

53:21.480 --> 53:22.480
Oh boy.

53:22.480 --> 53:25.120
So it's not as much as I thought, but it is a lot.

53:25.120 --> 53:27.080
Now here's where I spent money.

53:27.080 --> 53:32.820
I got 500 gigs of PCIe Gen 4 storage for the OS drive.

53:32.820 --> 53:39.520
That's 6.9 gigabytes of transfer a second, 6,900 megabytes, right?

53:39.520 --> 53:43.440
6,900 megabyte read, 5,000 megabyte write.

53:43.440 --> 53:44.440
That's pretty good.

53:44.440 --> 53:45.440
I think that worked for us.

53:45.440 --> 53:46.680
We can update that next door, huh?

53:46.680 --> 53:48.560
Yeah, that's PCIe Gen 4.

53:48.560 --> 53:55.640
And then for the bigger storage for like the recorded videos, which are just like 10 megabit

53:55.640 --> 54:04.240
bitrate videos, I went with a 4 terabyte storage, which is a 535 megabyte read and a 515 megabyte

54:04.240 --> 54:05.240
write.

54:05.240 --> 54:09.580
But again, we're just doing 10 megabit video or whatever, so should be fine.

54:09.580 --> 54:10.880
But that's kind of a spendy upgrade.

54:10.880 --> 54:12.960
That 4 terabytes there is kind of spendy.

54:12.960 --> 54:15.600
I would drop 485 bucks if I took that off.

54:15.600 --> 54:17.760
So if you already had some like storage you wanted to use...

54:17.760 --> 54:20.040
I kind of do, but it's spinning rust.

54:20.040 --> 54:22.240
I think I'd like to go SSD in this.

54:22.240 --> 54:23.240
Don't you think?

54:23.240 --> 54:24.240
It would be convenient.

54:24.240 --> 54:26.320
Yeah, but that's a debatable one.

54:26.320 --> 54:29.360
I think I could take it off and I could come up with probably a better way to do that.

54:29.360 --> 54:30.800
So I'm going to take off that additional storage.

54:30.800 --> 54:35.000
We'll just stick with the PCIe 4 storage for the OS drive.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.480
Yeah, that seems like the option you click if like money's not a big deal and you just

54:38.480 --> 54:42.680
want to forget about having to worry about storage for a while, which is a nice position.

54:42.680 --> 54:43.680
Yeah.

54:43.680 --> 54:44.680
All right.

54:44.680 --> 54:47.520
So looking at that, taking that modification off, that brings the Studio Thalio that I

54:47.520 --> 54:52.920
would build for OBS to $1,464 at $1,400.

54:52.920 --> 54:55.240
Now mind you, I would be buying an ARC GPU later.

54:55.240 --> 55:00.960
So that's another 280 bucks, but a base price of $1,400 for a machine that would probably

55:00.960 --> 55:04.160
work for us for eight years, 10 years as a streaming machine, maybe six years.

55:04.160 --> 55:05.160
I don't know.

55:05.160 --> 55:08.360
That seems like a pretty good deal actually.

55:08.360 --> 55:11.560
And you get a warranty in there too, which these machines certainly don't have.

55:11.560 --> 55:13.040
I don't know.

55:13.040 --> 55:14.400
That seems like a pretty fair value.

55:14.400 --> 55:15.400
I have to say.

55:15.400 --> 55:19.160
I know it's not the exact machine we tested, but it's still a really well-specced machine

55:19.160 --> 55:23.680
with 32 gigs of RAM and a nice high-end Intel CPU in there.

55:23.680 --> 55:26.240
So I'd be very happy to have that system.

55:26.240 --> 55:28.640
So I think you got to price it for the right workload.

55:28.640 --> 55:30.200
The nice thing is you got a lot of options.

55:30.200 --> 55:35.320
There's from AMD options to Intel options to Vigicards, no Vigicards, lots of storage,

55:35.320 --> 55:37.240
SSD, PCI storage, you name it.

55:37.240 --> 55:40.240
You got lots of options with the Thalio, including size options.

55:40.240 --> 55:43.560
So I think you just got to figure out what your workload is and go from there.

55:43.560 --> 55:47.820
And the way I would do that, if you really have no idea how to start, I would go grab

55:47.820 --> 55:51.640
those benchmark links that we have and compare them to your system.

55:51.640 --> 55:55.320
And you can kind of see where a laptop, the Dev1 fits in there or an old ThinkPad if you'd

55:55.320 --> 55:56.960
like to grab that.

55:56.960 --> 56:00.360
And a fairly well-specced, not the maximum Thalio.

56:00.360 --> 56:04.600
You could still spec it out even higher, but a well-specced Thalio and see where your systems

56:04.600 --> 56:05.600
fall in there.

56:05.600 --> 56:10.200
And then you can start to get a price performance ratio idea and maybe do a build from there.

56:10.200 --> 56:13.640
And I think if you buy this machine, you're going to be extremely happy with it.

56:13.640 --> 56:18.360
I had the unfortunate ending where mine died, but I don't really know what happened there.

56:18.360 --> 56:22.480
The last thing that happened to that machine is it was running and the smart plug got turned

56:22.480 --> 56:26.640
off and the machine was hard turned off.

56:26.640 --> 56:30.240
And then when we realized what happened, as we were getting it set up to do the show this

56:30.240 --> 56:34.680
morning, we turned the smart plug back on and when the Thalio gets power, the little

56:34.680 --> 56:39.840
light around the button turns on low, a soft light around the button and it's a good button.

56:39.840 --> 56:45.280
When you push the button in, very satisfied, then the light gets bright and the machine

56:45.280 --> 56:46.840
boots up.

56:46.840 --> 56:49.200
So it did that.

56:49.200 --> 56:55.260
And you could hear the fans kick in and just about as the boot process was done, right?

56:55.260 --> 57:02.520
As like X or Wayland was loading on the screen, the screen went blank, the LED lighter on

57:02.520 --> 57:06.720
the button went out, but the fans were on and like the LEDs inside the case were still

57:06.720 --> 57:07.720
going, right?

57:07.720 --> 57:13.360
It makes me think maybe something got disconnected with that button or maybe something died somewhere

57:13.360 --> 57:14.880
in like the motherboard or something.

57:14.880 --> 57:19.360
But I suspect you like that button so much that you've clicked it too many times at this

57:19.360 --> 57:20.360
point.

57:20.360 --> 57:21.360
Even just a couple of weeks, you've had it.

57:21.360 --> 57:22.360
I'm going to find out after the show.

57:22.360 --> 57:23.360
I'll find out.

57:23.360 --> 57:32.320
I'll report back next week if I remember, you know, I'll do my best.

57:32.320 --> 57:34.360
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

57:34.360 --> 57:36.440
That's where you go for yourself to try it out for free.

57:36.440 --> 57:40.280
Or it's a good way as an enterprise or a team to get started.

57:40.280 --> 57:44.800
Bitwarden is the easiest way for a business or an individual to store, share and sync

57:44.800 --> 57:46.040
sensitive data.

57:46.040 --> 57:50.440
It's what I use for passphrases, passwords, private information that maybe I want to keep

57:50.440 --> 57:54.360
in a vault that I have easy access to, but I know is truly protected and there's a safe

57:54.360 --> 57:56.700
way to share it with my team and my family.

57:56.700 --> 58:00.720
It's what Wes and I use to manage our passwords, our two factor codes and other sensitive data

58:00.720 --> 58:01.720
like recovery keys.

58:01.720 --> 58:07.280
And of course, Bitwarden has just been getting better and better as they've been a sponsor.

58:07.280 --> 58:09.360
They just did their October release.

58:09.360 --> 58:11.480
So great.

58:11.480 --> 58:12.960
Password protected, encrypted, export.

58:12.960 --> 58:16.040
You can export your vault in an encrypted format using a password of your choice.

58:16.040 --> 58:17.320
That's so nice.

58:17.320 --> 58:20.480
On mobile, the username generator is here.

58:20.480 --> 58:25.440
It also includes three out of the five aliases for generating an email address just for that

58:25.440 --> 58:30.120
service that Bitwarden supports, including DuckDuckGo email aliases.

58:30.120 --> 58:31.120
It's now in there.

58:31.120 --> 58:32.440
I'm not sure if it's in the mobile app.

58:32.440 --> 58:35.200
I should mention, depending when you're listening to this, the mobile apps can have to trickle

58:35.200 --> 58:36.200
out to the app stores.

58:36.200 --> 58:39.920
But these things are coming, including DuckDuckGo's email alias service.

58:39.920 --> 58:40.920
How cool is that?

58:40.920 --> 58:43.740
So now you don't have to give away your email address to these services.

58:43.740 --> 58:48.200
You can generate a unique username, a unique password, and a unique email address for every

58:48.200 --> 58:49.680
site and service you use.

58:49.680 --> 58:53.040
And you can use those complicated passwords on mobile, on your desktop.

58:53.040 --> 58:57.080
I grabbed the Flatpak from FlatHub and I used one of the very first things I install to

58:57.080 --> 59:00.440
get some of my applications up and going on my Linux desktop.

59:00.440 --> 59:01.440
It's so fantastic.

59:01.440 --> 59:05.080
Doing it any other way just feels like caveman stuff.

59:05.080 --> 59:06.760
I couldn't even imagine.

59:06.760 --> 59:09.040
So go try it out and support the show.

59:09.040 --> 59:11.880
Go get started by visiting bitwarden.com slash Linux.

59:11.880 --> 59:13.020
Try it for yourself.

59:13.020 --> 59:16.440
Maybe recommend it to your business, to your team you're working with, or maybe you know

59:16.440 --> 59:20.800
a friend or a family member who could just use better password practices.

59:20.800 --> 59:23.480
Send them all to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

59:23.480 --> 59:30.040
That's bitwarden.com slash Linux.

59:30.040 --> 59:34.080
This week for feedback, we're featuring two love letters.

59:34.080 --> 59:39.320
One of them is from Mike, longtime listener and lifetime Jupiter party member here saying

59:39.320 --> 59:43.440
thank you for introducing me to NixOS.

59:43.440 --> 59:48.140
I know the summer of immutability is long over now, but I've never been so smitten with

59:48.140 --> 59:50.800
a distro as I am now with NixOS.

59:50.800 --> 59:55.820
I reluctantly tried it to prove it was just all hype, but I was wrong.

59:55.820 --> 59:56.820
It's glorious.

59:56.820 --> 59:59.880
I've come to trust it more than I've ever trusted anything.

59:59.880 --> 01:00:04.280
It's so reliable and predictable that I'll swap my main production machine over to something

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:09.200
like Plasma or Sway for the weekend, play with it, and then just switch it back to GNOME

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.780
for work on Monday.

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:13.060
It's never failed me so far.

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:18.120
It's so reliable, in fact, that I grabbed one of these cheap Beelink mini PCs that you

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:23.760
recommended, threw NixOS and GNOME at it, and set up a VPN so my dad can plug it into

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.760
his television.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:30.680
My dad is a 65 year old and always seems to find a way to break software in new and interesting

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:31.680
ways.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:35.880
He's been using it for a month now and loves it so much that he's getting a Thalio and

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:38.600
having me replace his Intel Mac Mini.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:44.080
NixOS turns out to be a bit of a unicorn where it's great for tinkerers like me, but also

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:46.840
a bulletproof setup for friends and family.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:51.320
Thanks again for all you do and getting me on track on what has been my favorite Linux

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.840
experience ever.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:59.080
P.S. I even wrote an article doing a deep dive into why NixOS is so great.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.800
Which we'll have linked in the show notes.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.960
I had not even considered that.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.560
I've been having some upgrade struggles with my mom's laptop doing a little tech support

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:10.760
and sort of reconsidering like, well, you know, she's on the latest Ubuntu LTS at the

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.960
moment with Monte.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:16.160
She likes it fine, but I don't use that platform a whole lot.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.560
It's not the best thing for me to support on.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:21.920
I'd never considered NixOS, but gosh, Mike.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.320
You might be onto something here.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:27.640
You know, I have to say it was really nice on that Thalio when Linux 6.0 came out and

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:32.000
the NVIDIA driver wasn't compatible instead of doing a system upgrade and rebooting and

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.560
discovering we didn't have 3D graphics on a system that we were specifically using 3D

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.560
graphics on.

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.080
It's really nice just to have it say, no, I don't want to do the upgrade.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.080
You got a problem here.

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.080
You got to sort it out first.

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.080
That's so nice.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.080
It is.

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:46.760
It's exactly that kind of like nice remote safety to where it's like, OK, well, I can

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.840
upgrade you next time I'm there, then I don't need to do this remotely.

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.920
One other thing I'll say that's really nice about Nix that hasn't always been the case

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:59.000
for me on some Linux distributions is it's real easy to install software for the most

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
part.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.560
Some people like Linus Tech Tips sometimes mess that up, too.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.720
But it is for the most part, you got a lot of software to choose from.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.720
It's pretty easy to find it.

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.040
It's pretty easy to install it.

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.080
That's great.

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:12.040
Not always the case when it comes to removing the software, though.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:14.960
That sometimes breaks things or people have run into issues.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.520
I've heard from listeners that just say, I never uninstall anything.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.040
I just install it and I never uninstall.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.240
That's not the case with Nix.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:25.500
You remove something, it's like it was never there.

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:28.680
It's like it's just never even a trace of it.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:29.680
It's just glorious.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.340
It's completely cleaned up.

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:33.340
Love that about it.

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:36.060
And it's super easy to just spin up a little environment to have it to play with something

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:39.080
to know that when you're done, it's just gone.

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:43.940
And Chris, did you have to do anything special with Nix OS to get the Thalia working the

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:44.940
way you wanted?

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:48.800
Was there any special treatment you had to give it compared to some of your other systems?

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.800
I actually started with my config file from my dev one.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:55.760
So I just took my Nix config over from my dev one.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:01.080
And on the Nix wiki, I found like there was like three lines of code I needed to add to

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.560
support the NVIDIA driver, which is so nice.

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.320
You know, it's such a hit and miss experience.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:11.200
And on Nix, it was like, add these three lines that you got from the wiki and rebuild.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.200
You're good.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.200
You got the NVIDIA driver.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.200
Now you're done.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.560
There's no like going to the NVIDIA site and trying to go find the right version of the

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.280
driver and getting the link.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:20.280
Yeah.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.280
Yeah.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.280
Just so great.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.320
And you could specify if you want the beta driver, if you want the stable driver.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.080
And like what we decided to do is we switched the machine over to the LTS kernel and you

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.720
just change that in the Nix config, right?

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.600
Yeah, it's great, you know, and then reboot and done.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:38.540
And it gets the right NVIDIA modules for that automatically, builds them, installs them

01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:39.720
and you're done.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.680
So we made that modification, but not otherwise.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:43.680
No.

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:47.560
Because I started with a bare Nix box, move the config over.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.680
I did a rebuild and I was 95 percent the way there.

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:51.680
It was so awesome.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.880
Well, that's great to hear and it sounds like you're still in love with Nix.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:55.880
Oh, yeah.

01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:00.040
It's it's a struggle not to make every episode about Nix still, right?

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:04.720
Because I all I 100 percent agree with Mike.

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:10.260
It's the most exciting thing in Linux that I've come across in years.

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:12.760
And you know, they just voted to have like a new community organization that we should

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.320
dig into that at some point.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.080
It's so great.

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:19.320
So grateful that I found Nix and I love all the other distribution still.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.320
I mean, we have them.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.520
We actually don't have any Nix in the studio.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.120
Right tool for the right job kind of stuff.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.160
But maybe one day.

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:31.960
Aaron wrote in suggesting maybe this might be another love letter as well.

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:36.600
P.S. loving all the extra Brent on the different podcasts as of late.

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.720
When will J.B. launch the Brent hosted podcast Bug Squad?

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:46.080
This could include Brent's weekly bug find trying to reproduce bugs from issue trackers

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.920
or that tedious bug of the week.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.480
People either love it or hate it.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:54.440
I don't know at the rate you find bugs, I might need to be a daily show.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.440
Yeah.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.440
OK.

01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:01.200
Can you tell their listener that Brent picks the emails to the extra funny part is I got

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.640
a twin brother and his name's Aaron.

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:07.760
I don't think he wrote this, but I can't be sure something like Aaron on the side of caution

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.640
and it's you and your brother finding bugs, I think that'd be pretty great.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:12.640
Adorable.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:13.640
I mean, this is your life.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:15.120
So you might as well make content out of it.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.120
You're constantly finding the bugs.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.120
That's a good point.

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.480
They say write what you know.

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:19.480
I'm down.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.840
We'll make a we'll make a special event out of it.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:22.840
A little extra Brent.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.840
It's just the right amount.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.320
A little bit of Brent here for brunch.

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.320
Yeah.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.320
You know, nobody's making me brunch anymore.

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:28.320
No.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:29.320
Well, you'll have to come this way, Chris.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.320
Yeah.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.800
I better get up there before the served in the hot tub and I better get up there before

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.800
the snow.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.800
Right.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.800
I hear that's the thing.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:40.240
We do have a good batch of boost grams.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:44.600
Our first boost comes in from Tim White 101 with nineteen thousand nine hundred and ninety

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:45.600
nine sats.

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:51.160
He was almost a baller, but he was edged out by John A's maneuvering and he boosts in.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.800
I'm a new fountain user and this is my first boost.

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.200
I've been listening for a few years.

01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:57.880
You've inspired me to try a few things.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:04.840
I'm building the Alman nine NAS for my Plex set up to VMS and I'm ditching Google photos.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:05.840
Nice.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.840
Nice job, Tim.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:13.200
So I'm looking for a non ZFS storage to leverage my two ten terabyte seven K drives plus one

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:15.640
consumer MVME cache.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.120
I'd like a little bit of bit rot protection.

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:21.840
I like that LVM integrity, maybe some caching, but it's not supported with LVM.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:26.440
Stratus can import LVM integrity mirror and apply basic cash, but I'd love to do it all

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:30.080
in LVM or Stratus, but neither seem to allow both.

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:32.640
Do you gentlemen have a better way?

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:34.920
Well, no, I'd probably just use ZFS.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.920
I would use ButterFS.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.280
I really would.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.840
For this set up, I honestly would.

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:42.640
For two disks, I don't know, ZFS is a lot.

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:45.160
It's not built into the kernel, so you're taking that on.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:49.640
So now you've got to mitigate that kind of problem that sometimes crops up.

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:52.840
Whereas with ButterFS, it's like we were talking about with the Intel arc driver.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:53.840
It's upstream.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.420
It's in every release.

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:59.200
Every kernel version is basically slightly improving it, whereas ZFS, it's a much slower

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.600
development pace.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:05.760
It requires the proprietary module, which sometimes can break.

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:10.580
I mean, you could definitely do a two drive mirror in ZFS, plus you got that MVME.

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:11.580
You could definitely do it.

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:15.320
I would definitely just consider ButterFS.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:18.320
I think it's sort of a shame that Red Hat has gone the way of Stratus.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:25.560
I mean, I love XFS and I love LVM, but I think the future in that regard is ButterFS.

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.820
And if you think I'm wrong, try it.

01:07:27.820 --> 01:07:34.840
Because I was one of the loudest ButterFS haters on the internet, but they got better.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.980
They invested, things improved.

01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:38.520
We started deploying it.

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:46.040
And now I have many, many, many, many terabytes in ButterFS, and we're not losing data over

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:47.040
here.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:50.520
In fact, it's always the ButterFS arrays that come back up without a problem after an upgrade

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.520
every single time.

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:55.400
You know, there's some shiny new stuff, too, in these recent kernels, like in 6.0.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:59.520
I think some stuff landing in 6.1, so it's also a nice time to be a Butter user.

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:00.520
Yeah.

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:06.080
There's gonna be some really, there was some really nice stuff in 6.0, and I'm very excited

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.360
about what's in 6.1.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:08.360
Very excited.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:13.560
Didn't they fix a major issue in ButterFS that's been talked about for years now?

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.560
Right.

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:18.320
We need to do some testing, but apparently that RAID 5.6 whole issue has been solved

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.720
in Linux 6.0.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:23.840
Let's take some of Brent's most precious data, configure it on a new array, and see what

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:24.840
happens.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.400
Soham boosts in with a row of ducks.

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:31.400
Long time, first time, I've been listening for five plus years now.

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.280
Here's a blast from the past.

01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:37.400
What happened to Castablasta, you know, the one made with Hugin?

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:40.240
And he sent in another thousand SATs.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:43.880
Whatever happened to the clear Linux project from Intel?

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:44.880
Double boost, let's go!

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:46.760
Thank you for the double boost, Soham.

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:52.040
So let's start with what happened to Castablasta, which is our internal publishing tool.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.240
It's still going.

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.360
We just don't talk about it very much.

01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:55.360
Cast it away in the background.

01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.360
Yeah.

01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:58.720
I mean, it is very much an internal tool.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:03.160
I think we invasioned like something that would have something that anybody could pick

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.160
up and use.

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:08.000
But as time went on, we created something that meets all the edge cases for all the

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.720
various shows of ours that have all these weird historical legacy dependencies and stuff.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.640
And the particular tools that we happen to be using at the time?

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:20.080
I think it's safe to say like Castablasta 2.0 may be in the works.

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:25.440
Wes and I are getting serious in the conversations about self-generating all of our own RSS feeds.

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:30.000
A lot of times it's either done by a hosting platform or like a WordPress plugin or some

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.360
tool that generates the feed.

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:33.320
Oh, I was going to pitch you on a WordPress plugin.

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:34.320
Just kidding.

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.320
Yeah.

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:36.320
We'll have it.

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.320
We'll build it into our Hugin.

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.320
We'll make it a subdomain on our Hugin site.

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:42.720
And it's like feeds dot no, no, we're going to try to generate our own feeds here soon.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.480
And it may be the Castablasta tooling.

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:52.120
I'd say it really represents a set of tooling and Hugin, H-U-G-G-I-N or Hugin, is a free

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:55.560
software version of if this, then that, that you can host yourself.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.240
And that's been a really valuable tool for us.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:01.360
Yeah, it's a nice way to just accomplish a few, you know, scheduled tasks, check on some

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:04.920
various things, push things from here to there in a reactive way.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:05.920
Yeah.

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.800
When something shows up over here, kick off a process to then do this thing.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:09.800
And yeah.

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:10.800
And it's been really nice.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.240
And Wes has put a lot of good work into that for us to make it much simpler to publish

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.440
to all of the destinations that we have automagically.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:23.480
And guys, how would you both rate the stability of Castablasta since it's been kind of put

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.480
up?

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.760
I don't really hear us talking about it that often, actually.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.760
So how's that been?

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:34.280
I would say if anything, it's the services around it that we use that frequently have

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.320
issues.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:39.380
And then it's like, okay, every time you hit one of those, do you update the tooling to

01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:40.380
handle it?

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.440
Or do you just wait for the service provider to fix it?

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.840
So we run into that kind of stuff.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:44.840
Yeah, true.

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:45.840
Because there's a lot.

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:49.080
I mean, it's really just pushing bits around from a few places, a little transformations

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:50.280
with the encoding and such.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:54.720
But yeah, it's relying a lot on, like, syncing to various platforms or configuring things

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.640
or making sure database entries get the right way.

01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.320
And the longer we go, the more we're like, oh, we should just be doing that.

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.320
Yeah.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.320
We should just be taking that on.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.320
Because, like, you start fixing all that problems and you really build something great.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.400
And then all these external services start having issues.

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.880
Or maybe they don't support, like, the podcasting 2.0 stuff or whatever.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:12.880
Yeah.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:13.880
So, Clear Linux.

01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.200
So we asked, what happened to Clear Linux from Intel?

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.400
You know, they're still out there.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:21.920
There was rumors that were sent to us by people at Intel.

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:25.200
So there were rumors that it was going to shut down completely.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:28.220
It seems that they've done, like, a focus shift.

01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:32.160
After 2019, they released a desktop installer ISO in 2019.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.380
And that, I think, piqued a lot of interest.

01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:39.380
After that, though, they kind of quietly moved it more towards what they call a general purpose

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:45.520
distribution that's designed to be used by IT pros, dev ops, application developers,

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:46.760
cloud computing.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:50.120
For example, like, they're targeting Azure and AWS.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:54.360
And they're kind of creating something that is more built for that whole world now.

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.680
And not so much creating a general purpose Linux distribution anymore.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:11:59.680
Fair enough.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:03.200
I could see how Clear Linux kind of does lend itself to that sort of use case.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.760
Kind of a bummer, though, because it was like somebody out there building a sports card

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:07.760
Linux.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:08.760
Yeah.

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.480
You can't really check out from time to time.

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:11.480
We'll keep an eye on it, though.

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.480
We'll let you know if anything changes.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:17.320
Should have put Clear Linux on the old Thaleo, huh?

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.200
Forged Foe boosts in with 6,400 sets.

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:22.800
Coming in hot with the boost.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:28.100
Answering a question we asked a few episodes ago about what it would take to trust a new

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:29.520
product from Google.

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:34.080
And Forged Foe says, I love the threat of it going GPL.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.960
When Google starts a new project, the repo is verifiably mirrored into a third-party

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:39.960
escrow.

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:45.280
Then, as soon as Linux Unplugged reads the news of the project's demise, Chris, Wes,

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:50.360
and Brent simultaneously turn their keys that activates the decryption process.

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:54.640
Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, the triumvirate resurrects the source code from

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.640
the Google graveyard.

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:56.640
Yeah, right.

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.240
That works for me.

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.360
That is, I think, exactly.

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.960
I would totally be willing to install a key box here on the desk.

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:03.960
Yeah.

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:04.960
We could go on over to Brent.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.620
Get like a little wire guard tunnel, a little pie inside the box, so you turn it, it like

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:13.040
triggers something, and it just sends out a little message.

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:14.480
I think we could totally do that.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:16.920
Does it require all three keys to be turned at the exact same time?

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:21.280
I mean, I think what we do is we build like a five-second window because of internet lag.

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:22.960
We are really good at counting to four already.

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:23.960
Yeah, that's true.

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:24.960
We could do a four-second.

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:25.960
We know how we can do that.

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:30.620
So yeah, I think that's something that you should pitch to Google.

01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:33.440
The threat of GPL would probably keep them on it, actually.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.920
And they would never let go.

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.760
Vectron boosts in with 4,200 sets.

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:43.920
I'd be down to contribute to a meetup alternative if you guys start building one.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.480
Just get the parted starty and I'll join in.

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.560
I am interested in this.

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:51.960
We heard rumors on the road, right, of a new meetup being built.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:55.200
So we'll keep you posted, Vectron, and let you know.

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:58.360
We would like to create something that the community could use to self-organize their

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:03.040
own meetups and something we could use to organize our meetups that isn't meetup.com.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.720
Yeah, exactly.

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:10.200
Sam's Quanch boosting in with 16,180 Satoshis.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:13.860
You know, Jerry, I'm not going to tell you that these will increase in value or even

01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:15.280
hold their current value.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:17.960
The truth is you bought them because you like them.

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.320
They have value to you.

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.320
That's what matters.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.320
It's true.

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:25.240
Just a thank you to the group and to your voice, Chris.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:29.080
I've been listening nonstop since Christmas break 2006.

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:30.080
Whoa.

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:31.080
Wow.

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:38.280
Been a rabid listener since university, through my career as an engineer and now dev manager.

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:39.280
Keep killing it.

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.160
You keep killing it, Squanch.

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:42.160
That's awesome.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:45.740
I love knowing that kind of stuff, new or longtime listener.

01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:46.740
But it's been great.

01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:50.740
A theme of the Boost this week is a lot of long timers getting on the Boost.

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:57.960
And it's really great to see that as the podcast market is rushing towards dynamically inserted

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:01.640
ads as an easy way to just monetize podcasting.

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.840
I think this is how you push back on that kind of stuff.

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.960
And so I appreciate the long timers getting it.

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.600
They're getting it.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:10.360
Michael B. wrote in with 3,000 sets.

01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:11.360
Make it so.

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:12.600
My listening habits.

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:15.520
I'm just listening while driving from one place to the other.

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:19.120
As I can work from home, that happens not a lot.

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:24.060
Depending on that, I sometimes fall behind three to four Linux unplugged episodes.

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:25.240
I think it happens.

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:27.940
I think the way they phrase that, though, it makes it sound like they catch up.

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:29.760
So I really appreciate you making that effort.

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:30.760
Yeah, no kidding.

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:34.460
I like picturing Michael just getting in the car just to listen to an Atlantic's unplugged

01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:35.720
and going for a drive.

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:37.200
It sounds really nice, actually.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.380
Yeah, actually kind of does sound nice.

01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:40.380
That's a great idea.

01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:44.720
I with the gas prices, I've kind of stopped doing joy rides, but I feel like we should

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:45.720
bring it back.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.200
Shouldn't let big oil control my joy rides.

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:52.680
I mean, there are bicycles or an electric joy or a walk.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:55.720
That'd be good, too.

01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:56.720
You have a VR set up.

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:57.720
Oh, there you go.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:58.720
There you go.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:15:59.720
Yeah, thanks.

01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:07.360
Now boosted in with two thousand and six sets, two thousand six is the year we got the first

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:13.760
ever Linux World Conference and Expo in San Jose, California, which stood as the first

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:18.120
trade show style conference the Linux community ever held.

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:21.400
I remember the citation, according to the Linux Journal.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:27.920
As such, it being twenty twenty two currently and very and thankfully far from there, I'm

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:32.360
still going to Ohio Linux Fest this year and I do plan to record audio for you guys.

01:16:32.360 --> 01:16:36.440
I'm curious if you know a decent recording device not called my phone.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:42.200
Oh, now, if you're listening live or close to live, Amazon has a great sale on Zoom audio

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.200
recorders today.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:46.480
I mean, if you're going to treat yourself, there you go.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.440
You might be surprised if you've got a modern smartphone, you might be surprised.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:51.520
New little test recordings.

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:56.380
I like the voice recorder app on iOS and Android because it shows you real time levels unless

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:59.160
you save as wave if you set that.

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:04.200
And sometimes the camera app knows how to utilize the mic array and can also get pretty

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.200
good.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.200
The video can actually get pretty good audio depending on your phone.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:12.520
So you might experiment with that, otherwise for sort of on the scene type recording, you

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:17.280
know, because like you're not like in a booth studio sound wall, a little ambience and you're

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:20.120
walking around when you start walking around with a microphone and a recorder, like it

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.120
kind of sets a vibe.

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.120
Right.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:25.480
But if you just got a cell phone, like, like we had to get all of our professional recording

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:29.720
gear out of JPL, which was a Zoom and a and a and a microphone.

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:30.720
And a bread.

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:31.720
Yeah.

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:32.720
And but we could use our cameras.

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:36.560
Everyone in the group could record as much as we wanted with our cameras on our phone.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:39.120
And so it's just it's like people just see it differently.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:42.880
And so you might just consider consider trying it or look at the Zoom devices.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:43.880
You got any suggestions, Bradley?

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:49.840
Well, one thing I would say is no matter what you get or try, give it a shot before you

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.480
get to the conference.

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:53.800
Learn from our mistakes and try your device.

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.800
Try recording some stuff that might be similar.

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:59.400
You know, go to a place that I don't know, maybe even a restaurant or something.

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:05.060
I mean, don't push people's privacy, but test your equipment first and just see like what

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:09.560
situations it behaves well in and which situations it kind of falls down.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:12.480
Yeah, that is a great suggestion.

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:16.640
Go to a diner, go to a coffee shop, go somewhere where there's people talking and some background

01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:18.520
noise and see how clear it is.

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:19.520
Yeah.

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:20.520
So are you clipping?

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:21.520
Do you need to turn up your levels?

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:24.000
What all what all things need to get tweaked?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.440
We should just say, Neve, thank you.

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:28.240
Yeah, that is so awesome.

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:29.240
So thank you very much.

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.240
Even if you don't nail it.

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.640
I mean, we'll keep working with you on that kind of stuff because we really appreciate

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:33.640
that.

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.840
That's some great value for value right there.

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:36.880
Mr. Quackers boosted it with a row of ducks.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:39.600
That's two thousand two hundred and twenty two sets.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:40.600
Quacka Wacka.

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:41.600
It's a treasure.

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.600
Yippee.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:47.040
Huge shout out to Wes for stating something that bothers me about the Linux community

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:48.040
in general.

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.600
Is that my Snap package rant?

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.600
No.

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:51.600
I think we are too hard on new projects.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:55.640
I've played around with Rust bindings for GTK and even though the devs did a really

01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:01.560
great job at it, it still feels like C came first and Rust came second because that's

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.600
exactly what happened.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.880
Iced sounds great and I'm interested in giving it a shot.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:10.160
Yeah, there's been an interesting split here.

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:16.080
We talked last week about System76 going with iced and in that process, a conversation

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:19.960
around GTK and GNOME and the conversation that typically picks up.

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:23.160
There's a real split in our feedback.

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:27.920
End users seem down to clown with this and they like the take that, hey, what's the damage

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:28.920
in letting them try?

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:31.680
They're a good sized distro to experiment and it's not going to blow anything up if

01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:32.920
things go wrong.

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:37.600
Maybe something interesting gets built here, but the longtime developers in the community

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:43.500
that have given us feedback feel like this is egregious and everybody should just be

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:48.360
making GNOME better and make these things and work upstream and settle your disagreements

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:52.640
and there's just been a real interesting like end users seem to be down for it.

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:56.480
Developers in the community seem to be a little more against it.

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:59.040
There's a gradient to that too as well.

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.940
It's funny how these technical decisions can get our community so riled up and they're

01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:05.120
just details that you would never even know about on a commercial platform.

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:07.560
Who knew we all cared so much about toolkits?

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.160
Yeah, people care Wes.

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.920
They care a lot.

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:14.000
Hey citizen boosted in with 6969 sats.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Hey citizen.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:21.760
Another long timer boosting in this week and he says it's quite simply just le boost.

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:25.440
And now it is time for le boost.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:26.440
Thank you.

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:27.440
Hey citizen.

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.440
We appreciate it.

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:29.440
Thank you to user 256.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.360
They're a first time booster who earned some sats on fountain and sent in 600 sats.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:37.680
Now user 256, you got to go set your name in fountain.

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:42.560
We get 6900 sats from Dean L 70 says love the show.

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:44.320
There's always something new to listen to and learn.

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:45.320
Keep up the great work.

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:51.600
Dean L, Danelle Dean 70 hasn't caught on that we just started cycling from the back catalog

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:52.600
months ago.

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:53.600
I'm sorry.

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:56.520
I don't get your name right, but I do appreciate the 6900 sats and I'm glad you're enjoying

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:57.520
the show.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.240
Thank you everyone who sends in a boost to the show.

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:00.240
We read all of them.

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:04.040
We are selecting some on the show and not putting all of them on the show necessarily

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:05.880
kind of scanning them for content.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.460
But every boost does matter to us.

01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:12.240
Every boost motivates us and every boost is sent in over a totally decentralized peer

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:17.100
to peer free software payment system that's not tied to any commercial organization.

01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:18.680
And I find that absolutely awesome.

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:24.640
If you want to send a boost to the show, go grab a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:28.640
or you can get breeze if you don't want to switch apps or you can try out Alby.

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.640
I mean, there's so many options.

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:30.640
What about boost CLI?

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:32.400
Yeah, there's so many options over there.

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:35.960
So go check them out at newpodcastapps.com.

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:39.560
So we made it an executive decision for the picks this week.

01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:44.200
We looked at our picks because I thought we would, I mean, we have a roundup of picks.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:48.100
It's a pick like brigade, it's a pick buffet.

01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:50.760
It's like when brunch gets made and there's way too much food.

01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:52.720
You wouldn't know, you wouldn't know anything about this brunch.

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.440
Something about leftovers?

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:57.080
I actually think we could make an episode out of our picks.

01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.200
So we're going to hold the picks this week.

01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:02.960
No pre-show, no picks, getting crazy around here.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.920
But instead, what we're going to do is we're going to do something fun that we're going

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.840
to open up to the live stream.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:12.000
So we're going to kind of expand the idea and I want to put the invite out there now.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.600
If you'd like to join us next Sunday over at jupyter.tube at Sunday, noon Pacific, 3

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:19.720
pm Eastern, we're going to have something that we're going to make publicly available

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:23.520
for everybody to kind of bang on and produce something out of and see how far we can push

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:24.880
a system.

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:27.720
And so I'd like to get that out there now so you can come participate in that.

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:29.840
You got a little bit of a week's heads up if you're listening.

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.400
One more reason to join us live.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.400
Yeah, yeah.

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:36.360
And of course, what stinks is that if you're a couple of weeks behind, you're missing out

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.360
on this.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.380
We'll try to figure that kind of stuff out too for the future, kind of keep that in mind

01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:43.740
for all you work from homers that do slip behind from time to time.

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:49.240
If you want more show, remember, we actually have an entire additional Linux news podcast

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:54.480
at linuxactionnews.com where we broke down more of the ArcGPU stuff, some of the deets

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:55.480
there.

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:57.440
We're always following stuff at linuxactionnews.com.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:23:00.320
If you're in the industry, it's like one not to miss.

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:04.120
Just get the background you need to take part in the silly discussions we then have on the

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:05.120
show.

01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.120
That's true.

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:07.120
There is some additional context you'll pick up on.

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:08.680
We'd love to have you there.

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:13.400
So linuxactionnews.com for that, jupyter.tube for the live stream, or of course, the last

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:19.900
URL I'm going to throw in your face, linuxunplugged.com, slash, four, eight, zero.

01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:21.660
That's links to what we talked about today.

01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:27.480
Our contact form is over there for the emails, I don't know, anything you really want.

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:28.480
What else do you need?

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:34.000
We have an RSS feed that you can put in what you might call a podcast client and then just

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000
get our MP3s that way.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Could do.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Could do.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.720
You can also find us at podcastindex.org.

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:40.680
Oh, I wasn't going to do any more URLs.

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:41.680
Dang it.

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:42.880
Did you mention PeerTube?

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:46.400
I was going to try to sneak in jupyterbroadcasting.com because we've got the new website with all

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:49.880
the other shows, but I didn't want to do any more URLs, so I didn't say that.

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:52.760
We're switching to QR codes.

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:54.240
Maybe some sort of audible tone.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:56.800
Anyways, thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode.

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.920
See you right back here next Sunday.

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:40.000
We have a link to the Nix team creation stuff I was talking about in the show, if people

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000
are curious.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.760
I got to read through this before I wrap my whole naggersome around it, but it looks like

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:52.100
the community has voted to create a team that will be responsible for ownership of the Nix

01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:53.100
source code.

01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:57.280
The owners will be accountable for deciding on changes, commit sufficient time, and have

01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.920
the authority to make them happen.

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:04.840
This includes, but is not limited to, establish, communicate, and maintain a technical roadmap,

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:10.280
enable contributors, ensure capacity for reviewing PRs and addressing issues, define and assert

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:16.380
quality criteria, keep code healthy, documentation up to date, manage release life cycles, regularly

01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:20.400
publish reports on the work that's being done, and engage with third parties on the interest

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:21.400
of the project.

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:24.840
And they have some folks that they've already assembled here that they have listed in this

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:25.840
post.

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:29.920
Seems like a good thing, you know, a little more professionalization or whatever you might

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:35.040
call it, but getting a little more serious since I think, you know, Nix is doing well.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:38.160
Yeah, it's funny how it seems like all of a sudden it's just, I think it's really the

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:41.560
container era we live in has really contributed to some of the recognition it's got because

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:45.780
Nix OS makes a great base for that, or the Nix package manager works really great across

01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:49.400
multiple distros and OSs, so that's really handy.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.880
It's not the Linux unplugged effect.

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.280
Oh, I'm sure that's it.

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:56.120
But I always get a little bit apprehensive when I hear about structure changes when something's

01:25:56.120 --> 01:26:00.360
been working, but I don't know if we're necessarily exposed to all the inner workings.

01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:06.240
Like some stuff has been like a single contributor, and sometimes these changes are for the best,

01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:11.280
and it does make it safer for more people to depend on the project, I would say.

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.560
But I always am a little apprehensive.

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:16.760
It sounds to me like it's almost a maturing of the project in some ways, like putting

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:21.200
some safeguards in place and just thinking about maybe that bus problem that always comes

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.200
up from time to time.

01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:27.320
I suppose it's probably a good idea when you're getting to, you know, a decade old plus, it's

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.760
probably time to start thinking about it.

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:33.280
And think about how disappointed we'd be if something, you know, something stopped working

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:36.760
in Nix OS and, you know, didn't have the support structure in place, we wouldn't know what

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:38.100
was going on.

01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:51.680
Even like not renewing their SSL cert, that'd be so embarrassing.
