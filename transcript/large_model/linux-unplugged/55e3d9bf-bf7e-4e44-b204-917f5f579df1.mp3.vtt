00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 24 for January 21st, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.520
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's reporting

00:40.520 --> 00:43.400
from the trenches of the Init System Wars.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.400
My name is Chris.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.400
And my name is Matt.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.400
Hey there, Matt.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.880
You know what this is right here?

00:47.880 --> 00:48.880
What?

00:48.880 --> 00:49.880
This is episode 24.

00:49.880 --> 00:50.880
Already?

00:50.880 --> 00:53.640
And that's a special number because it does one of two things for me.

00:53.640 --> 00:58.560
Number 24 always reminds me that we are really just getting started, right?

00:58.560 --> 01:00.520
We've got a long ways to go still.

01:00.520 --> 01:05.580
But it also always makes me think of Jack Bauer, who was, well I spent some time loving

01:05.580 --> 01:06.580
on Jack Bauer for a while.

01:06.580 --> 01:08.480
Now I'm over 24.

01:08.480 --> 01:13.300
But in this episode it's a little bit like 24, this TV series, because there is a war

01:13.300 --> 01:14.800
against Upstart.

01:14.800 --> 01:19.160
There is a full-fledged assault against Upstart as Debian is nearing their vote.

01:19.160 --> 01:23.040
Now in the Linux action show, we said it looked like it was maybe going towards System D for

01:23.040 --> 01:24.040
Debian's choice.

01:24.040 --> 01:31.400
However, it is now four to four, four for Upstart and four for System D. It's head to

01:31.400 --> 01:37.840
head match and so commentators are taking to the web, opinion makers as it were, are

01:37.840 --> 01:41.480
going to the web and posting their for or against it for Upstart.

01:41.480 --> 01:44.680
It's been actually a fascinating conversation, but on top of that, if we still have enough

01:44.680 --> 01:48.240
time after that, and we might not because there's a lot to cover there, if we have enough

01:48.240 --> 01:51.880
time, I want to talk also about, I want to respond, might be a better way to put it,

01:51.880 --> 01:57.160
but I want to respond to some of this FUD that you're seeing crop up as new Linux users

01:57.160 --> 02:00.120
come over to Linux to try out Steam.

02:00.120 --> 02:04.760
And there has been a lot of jabs thrown at Microsoft, Paul Thrott and among others reported

02:04.760 --> 02:10.520
last week that internally at Microsoft, they consider Windows 8 the new Vista.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.040
That's what they call it, the new Vista.

02:12.040 --> 02:16.040
And that has got some Windows users in a tiff.

02:16.040 --> 02:19.440
And so they are responding to the people switching to Linux with a lot of FUD.

02:19.440 --> 02:23.600
So here we are in episode 24 of Unplugged.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.600
We'll get into some of that.

02:24.600 --> 02:25.840
But Matt, you know what we should start with?

02:25.840 --> 02:26.840
What's that?

02:26.840 --> 02:27.840
Probably our feedback.

02:27.840 --> 02:29.480
That'd be a good place to start, don't you think?

02:29.480 --> 02:30.560
I think it's an excellent place to start.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.560
I know.

02:31.560 --> 02:32.560
And you know what?

02:32.560 --> 02:33.560
I think it's wasted effort.

02:33.560 --> 02:34.560
Oh, who let him in here?

02:34.560 --> 02:35.560
Oh my goodness.

02:35.560 --> 02:37.680
I thought we kept him in a cage somewhere or like in the back room or whatever, right?

02:37.680 --> 02:38.680
Oh man.

02:38.680 --> 02:41.400
He's kind of like a, you know, we bring him out when things get really serious and we need

02:41.400 --> 02:43.520
some backup, we unleash Richard.

02:43.520 --> 02:44.520
That's right.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.520
Get it out of here.

02:45.520 --> 02:46.520
As he always says.

02:46.520 --> 02:47.520
All right.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.080
Well, first I want to just cover a little bit of feedback.

02:49.080 --> 02:52.240
So Jimmy wrote in to the Linux Unplugged show and he says, I've been a JV viewer for a

02:52.240 --> 02:54.240
little over a year and I love the show.

02:54.240 --> 02:58.080
I look forward to seeing it weekly and enjoy participating when time permits.

02:58.080 --> 03:01.680
I recently bought a hobby laptop that I'm using to experiment with different distros

03:01.680 --> 03:02.680
and desktops.

03:02.680 --> 03:07.000
I've been a KDE fanboy for some time and really love the interface customization and

03:07.000 --> 03:10.320
capabilities of the built-in widgets and apps that get the job done.

03:10.320 --> 03:15.000
However, I've become bored and frustrated so I took the arch challenge via Antegoros.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
Antegoros.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.680
I'm sorry, it's just ain't for me.

03:19.680 --> 03:23.280
I won't dig into the topic here and I'm not banging on the distro or arch concept.

03:23.280 --> 03:27.280
I just didn't like it and I was missing a couple of odd packages I needed for work stuff.

03:27.280 --> 03:31.440
So I moved to another distro with no fewer than 12 on this laptop in succession.

03:31.440 --> 03:36.040
He says, I want to give a quick plug for Solid K. It's well put together.

03:36.040 --> 03:39.440
So I've landed on the right distro base, Debian, but now it's the desktops turn.

03:39.440 --> 03:42.760
I've tried out several, which include elementary, Cinnamon, KDE, Xfce.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.360
What the heck's going on in our community?

03:44.360 --> 03:48.320
Honestly, I don't feel compelled and I hate having to use that word by any of them.

03:48.320 --> 03:51.920
I know how to tweak KDE to make it look awesome, but dang, I just want something different

03:51.920 --> 03:53.360
and nice to look at.

03:53.360 --> 03:56.960
I think elementary is close, but it lacks some innate features that I like, e.g. a

03:56.960 --> 03:58.960
trash can and minimizing customization.

03:58.960 --> 04:03.360
Cinnamon's looking pretty good and I thought I had found a new home, but it kept freezing

04:03.360 --> 04:04.360
up.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.360
So adios.

04:05.360 --> 04:09.320
I don't like mate, and I just don't like the Windows, the Window Managers, WMs.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.160
So I thought, what do I have left?

04:11.160 --> 04:12.160
Unity.

04:12.160 --> 04:16.000
If I had more customization and Canonica would decide to make Ubuntu a rolling release, it

04:16.000 --> 04:18.760
might do it, but then, for now, I'll have to pass.

04:18.760 --> 04:19.760
So what have I got left?

04:19.760 --> 04:25.800
If there's anything the community should focus on for 2014, I'd vote for improving

04:25.800 --> 04:26.800
the desktop environment.

04:26.800 --> 04:27.800
Think about it.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.260
What's the first thing a new user sees when he installs Linux, besides grub?

04:31.260 --> 04:34.360
The entire experience can be tied down to how well the desktop environment handles a

04:34.360 --> 04:37.080
user's input right now, and they suck.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.880
So that might be being a little harsh, but I feel kind of jaded.

04:39.880 --> 04:44.080
If only there were a way to tie together the awesomeness of KDE and the simplicity of GNOME,

04:44.080 --> 04:48.300
make it fast, lean, and fully customizable, and put a stinking trashcan on the taskbar,

04:48.300 --> 04:49.580
and minimize.

04:49.580 --> 04:52.080
Make it different and modern, and no more cartoony icons.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.880
I wish I knew how to do it because I can see it plainly in my mind.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.460
Anyways, he says thanks for letting me rant.

04:57.460 --> 04:58.460
Thanks again.

04:58.460 --> 04:59.460
Jimmy.

04:59.460 --> 05:03.600
You know, I honestly would say probably what he's going to want to do is revisit XFCE.

05:03.600 --> 05:07.100
Not because out of the box it's butt ugly, I'm not going to argue that, but actually

05:07.100 --> 05:12.400
spend a good 30 minutes or so really hunting down a good level of customization that really

05:12.400 --> 05:13.400
meets his needs.

05:13.400 --> 05:17.940
I think he might be surprised and actually get that sweet spot he's looking for.

05:17.940 --> 05:22.360
It's not an automatic fix, but I think it's definitely something to consider until GNOME

05:22.360 --> 05:24.440
and KDE are able to do what he needs.

05:24.440 --> 05:31.260
Yeah, I agree, and also sometimes it's a really hard thing because sometimes you cannot like

05:31.260 --> 05:35.060
something because it's just so different, and it's hard to recognize that's what's actually

05:35.060 --> 05:36.060
going on.

05:36.060 --> 05:38.640
Or it might be interfering with his workflow too, and I mean I can understand that too.

05:38.640 --> 05:39.640
Well, that's why you won't like it, right?

05:39.640 --> 05:42.680
Because if something's different and it interrupts your workflow, it slows you down, it makes

05:42.680 --> 05:45.720
you less efficient, it makes you have to constantly rethink what you're supposed to do.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.480
However, I was just talking about this on the pre-show, but one of the things I've done

05:48.480 --> 05:53.280
since our In Defense of GNOME episode that we did on last a few weeks ago is I forced

05:53.280 --> 06:01.100
myself to just keep using GNOME because a lot of times I jump around, and I become an

06:01.100 --> 06:04.300
expert in all but a master in none when I do that.

06:04.300 --> 06:09.440
And so I said, okay, no, Chris, you're going to use GNOME for at least a month, if not

06:09.440 --> 06:14.680
more, and every day you have to teach yourself a new GNOME way of doing things.

06:14.680 --> 06:18.520
Whatever the GNOME philosophy is, and I've been reading a lot of the GNOME tricks and

06:18.520 --> 06:22.120
shortcuts and how-tos and watching some YouTube videos on the way people use GNOME, sort of

06:22.120 --> 06:23.800
retraining my brain.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.840
And now I'm kind of getting to the point where I'm not just kind of liking it, but I'm loving

06:27.840 --> 06:28.840
it.

06:28.840 --> 06:29.840
I want to become a GNOME advocate.

06:29.840 --> 06:32.240
I'm like, this is great.

06:32.240 --> 06:35.760
And if you spend the time to relearn how to ride the bike and then ride the bike in the

06:35.760 --> 06:38.380
right way, it is incredibly rewarding.

06:38.380 --> 06:42.840
But the process of getting there requires that level of dedication, which nobody really

06:42.840 --> 06:45.080
has the time to do in the real world.

06:45.080 --> 06:48.360
People aren't podcasters who actually need to have perspectives on these kind of things

06:48.360 --> 06:50.980
and so have the luxury of forcing themselves to do this.

06:50.980 --> 06:52.260
People have work to get done.

06:52.260 --> 06:55.440
So I totally understand where he's coming from here, but it is one of these hard things

06:55.440 --> 07:00.400
where sometimes you're never going to be happy until you train yourself to live in the way

07:00.400 --> 07:01.980
that desktop operates.

07:01.980 --> 07:03.720
And I think you can do that with anything.

07:03.720 --> 07:04.720
You can do it with XFCE.

07:04.720 --> 07:05.720
You can do it with KDE.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.800
You can do it with GNOME.

07:06.800 --> 07:07.800
Those I think require it the most.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.840
And then of course you have your tiling window managers and things like that.

07:10.840 --> 07:17.400
And I think what sometimes people want is they want really sane defaults that look new

07:17.400 --> 07:21.560
and have new ideas around them, but aren't really all that different.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.600
Sort of what elementary OS tries to do.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.560
And I also think they're coming from a way of doing things to where they were trapped

07:26.560 --> 07:29.680
in a user experience to where if it doesn't come out of the box that way, you're kind

07:29.680 --> 07:34.040
of stuck, not really taking the time to say, oh hey, I can theme this or oh hey, I can

07:34.040 --> 07:39.600
maybe take a dock, slide it up this direction, move this bar over there, tweak these icons.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.720
Actually look at the way things are flowing as far as, there's so much customization that

07:42.720 --> 07:44.240
can be done.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.240
But I think you're right.

07:45.240 --> 07:48.380
I think they are victims of a default mentality.

07:48.380 --> 07:49.520
So Friar Tuck wrote it.

07:49.520 --> 07:50.520
How about that one?

07:50.520 --> 07:51.520
How do you like it?

07:51.520 --> 07:52.520
I like it.

07:52.520 --> 07:53.520
This is a new one.

07:53.520 --> 07:54.520
And check this out.

07:54.520 --> 07:58.120
So this is why every now and then as the music's playing us off the show, I'm like, hey, could

07:58.120 --> 08:00.760
you please go over to iTunes and give us a rating and a comment?

08:00.760 --> 08:03.560
It helps people find us and that helps them switch to Linux.

08:03.560 --> 08:04.560
It actually is true.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.560
Here's Friar Tuck.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.240
He writes and he says, first off, thanks for all the great shows.

08:07.240 --> 08:11.400
I discovered Jupiter broadcasting in an iTunes store when I was searching for the Linux podcast.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.080
I was curious and I wanted to learn more about Linux.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.680
Linux Unplugged was the first show I found.

08:15.680 --> 08:19.320
Now see the timing works out because that was back when the show was new and we were

08:19.320 --> 08:22.020
asking people to go comment and rate a lot back then.

08:22.020 --> 08:25.640
And so for a while we were staying very high in the iTunes charts.

08:25.640 --> 08:30.120
Thing is is it requires kind of continuous maintenance from the audience to leave comments

08:30.120 --> 08:31.120
and rate.

08:31.120 --> 08:33.440
So if you are an iTunes user, please consider doing that because it does help people find

08:33.440 --> 08:35.480
the show and then they switch to Linux.

08:35.480 --> 08:39.480
He says, in this week's Linux Unplugged, you spent a fair bit of time talking about Google's

08:39.480 --> 08:41.640
purchase of Nest Labs.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.800
I think this article touches on a very real reason why Google purchased Nest.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.780
And he links it and I'll talk about that in a second.

08:46.780 --> 08:49.980
The article talks about Nest Labs' robotics divisions.

08:49.980 --> 08:52.320
Google is already heavy into robotics research.

08:52.320 --> 08:56.320
They may have purchased Nest as an investment in futuristic business models rather than

08:56.320 --> 08:59.280
a thin attempt to break into Nest's current business model.

08:59.280 --> 09:02.720
Thanks for all you do and good luck with the new space and keep up the good work.

09:02.720 --> 09:06.160
So this article that he linked us to, and I'll have the full article in the show notes,

09:06.160 --> 09:10.160
they talk about, I didn't even know this about Nest because I didn't really follow them that

09:10.160 --> 09:16.040
closely, but Nest has always thought of itself, according to this piece that was written,

09:16.040 --> 09:19.760
Nest has always considered itself a robotics company.

09:19.760 --> 09:23.240
They say the robot is just hidden inside a sleek Apple-ish case.

09:23.240 --> 09:28.920
They said, look who the company brought in as its VP of technology.

09:28.920 --> 09:34.040
Volke Muskoka, I'm probably saying that wrong, but she is a roboticist and an artificial

09:34.040 --> 09:38.000
intelligence expert from the University of Washington.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.360
They hired to bring her in as the VP of technology and in this article they have a shot of her

09:41.360 --> 09:46.360
right here working with a robot arm at Nest.

09:46.360 --> 09:47.360
And so...

09:47.360 --> 09:48.360
Oh wow.

09:48.360 --> 09:53.520
So apparently, Nest also was very heavily into robotics and we also know that Google

09:53.520 --> 09:58.360
just bought the guys that, who, who, who, ah, ah, shoot, I'm totally forgetting the

09:58.360 --> 09:59.360
name of that company.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.880
That's a crazy looking arm.

10:00.880 --> 10:05.360
Hey Mumble, what was the name of that robotics company that Google just bought that has all

10:05.360 --> 10:06.360
the Pentagon contracts?

10:06.360 --> 10:07.360
What was that?

10:07.360 --> 10:08.360
What was it?

10:08.360 --> 10:09.360
Boston Robotics or something?

10:09.360 --> 10:10.360
Boston Dynamics, right?

10:10.360 --> 10:11.360
Yeah, okay.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.360
Yeah, okay, thanks.

10:12.360 --> 10:15.520
Yeah, so Boston Dynamics, they just recently, plus like they bought like eight other robotics

10:15.520 --> 10:17.000
companies last year.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.160
But Google is getting big time into the Rosie the robot role here.

10:21.160 --> 10:24.080
They're going to, they're going to integrate Google now and Rosie the robot.

10:24.080 --> 10:25.080
I'm a man.

10:25.080 --> 10:28.720
If they have somebody that wants to do my dishes, I think I would be perfectly okay

10:28.720 --> 10:29.720
though.

10:29.720 --> 10:30.720
Although I can probably do without the maid thing.

10:30.720 --> 10:34.520
I think we could do, we could talk about a trade there, Google, but that's a, that's

10:34.520 --> 10:39.440
an interesting perspective and makes it even a little creepier to be honest with you.

10:39.440 --> 10:40.720
So thanks Friar Tuck.

10:40.720 --> 10:41.720
Thanks for writing in.

10:41.720 --> 10:42.720
All right.

10:42.720 --> 10:46.760
Well, so we, I have the results of our innovative little guy survey where last week we asked

10:46.760 --> 10:51.840
folks to send in the distribution that is a little, it's small, you know, in, in terms

10:51.840 --> 10:55.920
of distro sizes, doesn't get much attention, but does something really interesting and

10:55.920 --> 10:56.920
unique.

10:56.920 --> 11:00.680
And we had a form in the show notes for last week's episode and we asked you guys to submit

11:00.680 --> 11:04.520
the name of the distro and why you felt it was innovative and what was innovative about

11:04.520 --> 11:05.520
it.

11:05.520 --> 11:06.520
And I've got the results from that.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.440
I guess you could almost call it a survey.

11:08.440 --> 11:12.720
So first, before we get to that, I want to thank Ting.com Ting is mobile that makes sense.

11:12.720 --> 11:17.560
My mobile service provider and you guessed it, also Matt's mobile service provider.

11:17.560 --> 11:18.560
Absolutely.

11:18.560 --> 11:25.140
Ting has no early, no early termination fees and no contracts because honestly Ting is

11:25.140 --> 11:28.640
focused on the customer relationship and on the service for the customer.

11:28.640 --> 11:31.800
And so a lot of the things they've set up are really to that end and Ting has been the

11:31.800 --> 11:32.800
pioneer at this.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.880
They've been the first doing it and they're doing it the best because it's really their

11:35.880 --> 11:37.280
core business focus.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.200
The people behind Ting is two cows.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.680
Now if you're familiar with two cows, they've done a lot of things on the web for a long

11:41.680 --> 11:47.280
time and one of their missions has always been go into a market that is ripe for disruption,

11:47.280 --> 11:51.560
that needs to be corrected and go in there and offer the service the way it should be

11:51.560 --> 11:53.720
and just gain market share by doing that.

11:53.720 --> 11:58.400
Not by dirty tactics, not by copying your competitors business strategies, but by actually

11:58.400 --> 12:00.040
innovating in that space.

12:00.040 --> 12:03.240
That's what I love about Ting and that's what you would love about Ting too if you go over

12:03.240 --> 12:04.240
there and try it out.

12:04.240 --> 12:08.200
Not only that, but Ting is an exceedingly transparent company and that is a very refreshing

12:08.200 --> 12:09.960
thing for a wireless company.

12:09.960 --> 12:14.960
They just had a blog post kind of poking some fun at CEO for trying to copy some of the

12:14.960 --> 12:18.400
Ting Mojo and of course falling a little flat on that.

12:18.400 --> 12:21.640
They also have a lot of great things over on the Ting blog like great apps you can check

12:21.640 --> 12:25.880
out, new service updates, roll outs of their tri-band LTE.

12:25.880 --> 12:29.040
When they had the Nexus 5 coming over the Ting network, they were keeping people posted

12:29.040 --> 12:30.040
over there.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.800
So as a long time Ting customer now, I really appreciate that blog.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.280
I also really appreciate the Ting dashboard.

12:36.280 --> 12:40.280
It really strikes a balance between simple and easy to use, but incredibly powerful.

12:40.280 --> 12:44.760
They combine that with the Ting app and the two work hand in hand so brilliantly.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.880
I can have alerts and push notifications sent to my phone if I need to.

12:47.880 --> 12:52.400
One of the great things about Ting is it's only pay for what you use and the dashboard's

12:52.400 --> 12:55.480
UI makes this incredibly easy to monitor and manage.

12:55.480 --> 12:59.720
They have this really simple dial system that tell you exactly where you're at, sort of

12:59.720 --> 13:03.320
like a gas gauge, and it just clicks with you immediately when you see it.

13:03.320 --> 13:04.400
You totally know where you're at.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.600
You don't have to sit there and dig through all these line items and they're not sneaking

13:07.600 --> 13:08.600
anything in there.

13:08.600 --> 13:13.400
A Ting plan includes hotspot, it includes tethering, voicemail, caller ID, picture messaging,

13:13.400 --> 13:14.400
all of that's included.

13:14.400 --> 13:17.440
Ting just takes your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes, they add them up at the

13:17.440 --> 13:21.120
end of the month, whatever bucket you fall into, that's what you pay.

13:21.120 --> 13:24.880
It's $6 a month for the flat line and then it's just your usage on top of that.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.880
It's extremely straightforward, it's super simple, and Ting has a whole bunch of great

13:28.880 --> 13:29.880
devices.

13:29.880 --> 13:30.880
Here's how you get started.

13:30.880 --> 13:31.880
Go to linux.ting.com.

13:31.880 --> 13:34.960
That'll take $25 off your first device.

13:34.960 --> 13:39.480
If you've got a Sprint compatible phone, that'll give you $25 off your first month of service

13:39.480 --> 13:40.480
if you want to bring that device.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.880
They've got a BYOD page you can check out.

13:42.880 --> 13:47.600
Ting is mobile, it makes sense, and Ting is my mobile service provider for a reason.

13:47.600 --> 13:51.560
Also Ting will help you get out of your early termination relief up to 25% per line.

13:51.560 --> 13:54.840
You can go to ting.com slash ETF to find out more about that.

13:54.840 --> 13:57.040
So go to linux.ting.com to get started.

13:57.040 --> 14:01.440
Go check them out, try out their savings calculator, and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring

14:01.440 --> 14:03.800
Linux Unplugged.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.280
Totally love the Ting.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.280
Ting.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.280
Ting.

14:07.280 --> 14:12.040
So I have these results from the survey here that we, well survey, whatever you want to

14:12.040 --> 14:20.120
call it, and Angela calculated these using her Computatron 2000, and we got a bunch of,

14:20.120 --> 14:26.000
we got about 60 individual submissions, which is pretty good for a poll that we mentioned

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
at the end of the episode.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Oh yeah.

14:28.000 --> 14:33.280
It was spread across a whole bunch of different distros, but there was a few that really stood

14:33.280 --> 14:35.080
out in here.

14:35.080 --> 14:39.960
PerOS came in a couple of times, Bowdai Linux came in once, got a couple of mentions for

14:39.960 --> 14:45.240
Gentoo, but really what, the number one, the number one distro was Manjaro.

14:45.240 --> 14:46.240
Interesting.

14:46.240 --> 14:52.760
Now I feel like, I mean Manjaro is a small distro, I don't, you know, but I also kind

14:52.760 --> 14:57.280
of feel like it might be too big for what I was thinking.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.920
It's, first of all, it's not even like a main release.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.120
I mean, I definitely agree with you.

15:01.120 --> 15:05.080
It's kind of on that cusp and I can't really, boy, you know, when I first started using

15:05.080 --> 15:08.720
it I would say it was probably small enough, but now it's kind of, it's growing so quickly.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.720
It's kind of hard to say.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.760
PerOS got a submission.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.560
Of course, PerOS has shut down now.

15:14.560 --> 15:18.240
It would almost be interesting to look at PerOS and just say, oh, it's like a goodbye.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.240
Like here's what it was.

15:19.240 --> 15:20.340
Here's what it did great.

15:20.340 --> 15:21.340
So long.

15:21.340 --> 15:22.340
Thanks for all the hard work.

15:22.340 --> 15:23.340
I mean, maybe Crunchbang.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.340
I mean, I don't know.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.280
I mean, but then again, Manjaro was rated highest.

15:26.280 --> 15:30.080
I mean, so this, the other one that came in, the other one that came in second to Manjaro

15:30.080 --> 15:33.640
that I was, I've been, I've never looked at, but we just actually, it was just mentioned

15:33.640 --> 15:34.640
in an email.

15:34.640 --> 15:35.640
Solid XK.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.160
I don't know how you say it.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.160
Solid X.

15:38.160 --> 15:41.480
It is S O L Y D X K.

15:41.480 --> 15:45.640
I believe it's based on Debian and it has a couple of neat features.

15:45.640 --> 15:49.080
And so I think that might be a solid one to check out.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.800
S O L Y D X K.

15:51.800 --> 15:55.440
And it's one that I've heard mentioned by our audience is not one I've checked out myself.

15:55.440 --> 16:00.240
And so this, so not only was it the second most submitted, but it's one that I personally

16:00.240 --> 16:02.000
would like to check out because I haven't yet.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.160
It's kind of in my blind spot.

16:03.160 --> 16:06.160
So I'm kind of thinking we'll do a review of Solid X K.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.200
Yeah.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.200
And these are great.

16:09.200 --> 16:14.680
Netrunner OS got in here, Jolly, DSL, a whole bunch of them got in there.

16:14.680 --> 16:18.160
I'll have a link in the show notes if you guys want to see which ones are submitted.

16:18.160 --> 16:22.360
But yeah, it's based on Debian testing, says Art of Music in our IRC room.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.360
So that could be really cool.

16:23.360 --> 16:27.800
Because you know, a lot of people out there are thinking about Debian testing as a potential

16:27.800 --> 16:28.800
desktop.

16:28.800 --> 16:33.760
So if they've conjured that into something that's quite nice to use, that could be interesting.

16:33.760 --> 16:39.880
So stay tuned on a future Linux action show where we will have that review coming soon.

16:39.880 --> 16:43.440
I got some other stuff in the pipeline, but that'll be coming fairly soon.

16:43.440 --> 16:44.440
Okay.

16:44.440 --> 16:48.120
Well, I wanted to talk about something that's, I don't know if you guys have been noticing

16:48.120 --> 16:54.760
this, but seems like there's a bit of a war against Upstart these days.

16:54.760 --> 16:59.440
You know, obviously this Debian decision is looming and it's got people coming out of

16:59.440 --> 17:06.000
the woodwork talking about Upstart, talking about the CLA, all these kinds of things.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.560
And so I have a couple of, before we jump into this, I got a couple of recent posts

17:10.560 --> 17:12.760
that just happened in the last couple of days.

17:12.760 --> 17:17.160
Linus Torvalds took to Google Plus and commented in a thread over there.

17:17.160 --> 17:24.320
He said, and this was a response to a post that I believe Matthew Garrett had started

17:24.320 --> 17:30.360
about the CLA, and Linus said that, to be fair, people just like to hate on canonical.

17:30.360 --> 17:34.320
But any, in his overall premises, any CLA is fundamentally broken.

17:34.320 --> 17:38.720
The FSF and the Apache Foundation CLA's are pretty much equally broken, and they may not

17:38.720 --> 17:44.800
have been broken because of any, oh, he says, but because of copyright assignment, paperwork

17:44.800 --> 17:47.520
ends up basically killing a community.

17:47.520 --> 17:51.960
Basically with a CLA, you don't get the kind of long tail that the kernel has of random

17:51.960 --> 17:52.960
drive-by patches.

17:52.960 --> 17:58.520
And since that's how a lot of people try the waters, any CLA at all, like changing a license

17:58.520 --> 18:03.680
or not, even if it doesn't have a license changing provision, is fundamentally broken.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.840
Matthew Garrett went on to say that not all CLA's are created equal.

18:06.840 --> 18:10.640
He said, why do people object so much to canonical when they do it?

18:10.640 --> 18:14.080
He says, I've written about this before in the context of Mirror, but it's worth expanding

18:14.080 --> 18:15.200
upon.

18:15.200 --> 18:19.400
For example, the SFS copyright assignment ensures that contributions to the GPLed software

18:19.400 --> 18:24.000
will only be distributed under a GPL-style license, whereas the Apache CLA permits the

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
ASF to re-license a contribution under a proprietary license, but the Apache license already allows

18:29.000 --> 18:30.840
you to do that anyways.

18:30.840 --> 18:36.720
In contrast, canonical ships software under the GPL-3 family of licenses, but requires

18:36.720 --> 18:40.640
the contributor sign an agreement that permits Canonical to re-license their contributions

18:40.640 --> 18:42.960
under a proprietary license.

18:42.960 --> 18:47.360
This is fundamentally a different situation to almost all widely accepted CLA's, and is

18:47.360 --> 18:52.040
disingenuous of Canonical to defend their CLA by pointing out the broad community uptake,

18:52.040 --> 18:55.160
for instance, of the Apache CLA.

18:55.160 --> 18:58.480
So this is sort of an interesting one-two approach.

18:58.480 --> 19:03.720
So you've got some folks that are going after the CLA and trying to expose what they foresee

19:03.720 --> 19:06.000
as problems that the CLA presents.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.920
And then on the other hand, you have folks who are going after Upstart on a technical

19:10.920 --> 19:14.200
level, like Lenart Potteran, creator of SystemD.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.200
He took to G+.

19:15.200 --> 19:21.800
A couple of times recently, last night, he wrote, shutting down is hard.

19:21.800 --> 19:26.040
I'm sorry for piling on, but there's an interesting aspect of Upstart I'd like to shed some light

19:26.040 --> 19:27.040
on.

19:27.040 --> 19:30.480
Not necessarily because it's hard to fix, but simply because it's quite interesting.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.360
As it stands now, Upstart will eat your file system.

19:33.360 --> 19:37.600
And then he goes on to kind of explain how in some use case scenarios, if something is

19:37.600 --> 19:43.360
reading a file and it doesn't get shut down properly and your system powers off, it could

19:43.360 --> 19:45.780
potentially damage the file system.

19:45.780 --> 19:50.500
And another post, he says, it appears the Debian Technical Committee is in discussions

19:50.500 --> 19:51.500
right now.

19:51.500 --> 19:56.840
And he goes on to talk about how they're not necessarily talking about technical limitations

19:56.840 --> 19:57.840
of Upstart.

19:57.840 --> 20:01.800
He says, for example, Upstart doesn't mount file systems properly at boot.

20:01.800 --> 20:08.120
The existence of mountall in Upstart and the non-integration of etcfstab into the Upstart rule set results

20:08.120 --> 20:10.480
in a lot of additional shortcomings.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.920
Mountall is a one-time thing for a boot process.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.360
All context of file system devices and mounts is lost.

20:16.360 --> 20:22.400
After it ran, the file system state is henceforth assumed static, which of course is not how

20:22.400 --> 20:23.920
systems work these days.

20:23.920 --> 20:27.720
This design flaw is one of the things we noticed when we looked into Upstart in detail before

20:27.720 --> 20:30.480
we decided to start SystemD four years later.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.480
Nothing has changed.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.120
The Upstart design still cannot cover this.

20:33.120 --> 20:36.280
And he goes on to list a lot of other shortcomings with Upstart.

20:36.280 --> 20:40.480
And this is also all linked in further detail, which you can read yourself on G+.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.480
He's a very long post.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.560
I'm not going to read all of them.

20:43.560 --> 20:51.040
And so this to me clearly is happening at this time because of this looming Debian decision.

20:51.040 --> 20:55.640
It's absolutely vested in trying to kind of sway a position.

20:55.640 --> 20:59.320
And there's no question that undoubtedly there's a lot of truth in it.

20:59.320 --> 21:04.160
But at the end of the day, I do feel it's kind of disingenuous to – for them to release

21:04.160 --> 21:07.920
it like – it's kind of like voting one way or the other because you're about to

21:07.920 --> 21:08.920
get reelected.

21:08.920 --> 21:09.920
Yeah.

21:09.920 --> 21:10.920
It's that kind of thing.

21:10.920 --> 21:11.920
It's very political.

21:11.920 --> 21:12.920
And that's a turnoff for me.

21:12.920 --> 21:16.160
So you have this worthwhile information, potentially worthwhile information.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.320
I know nothing of it as far as its authenticity.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.000
I'm not into that sort of thing.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.560
But I do know that – yeah, the timing kind of rubs me the wrong way.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.440
So it's very probable.

21:26.440 --> 21:31.040
I would actually prefer evidence versus just somebody that makes a claim that I've – again,

21:31.040 --> 21:34.840
I would need to see more evidence to that fact or some examples or hell, even a YouTube

21:34.840 --> 21:35.840
video showing it happened.

21:35.840 --> 21:36.840
That would be cool.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.840
Just something to kind of push me in that direction.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.440
But yeah, the timing is a real turnoff for me.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.440
I'm just not cool with it.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.440
Yeah.

21:42.440 --> 21:43.640
You mean in terms of like it actually eating the file system like –

21:43.640 --> 21:44.640
Yeah.

21:44.640 --> 21:48.960
There's so much FUD on the internet that there's the truth and then there's FUD.

21:48.960 --> 21:52.900
And trying to distinguish between the two, it's – honestly, it's convoluted.

21:52.900 --> 21:54.840
And you've got to be very careful of mob mentality.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.560
I think in this particular case, he's probably correct.

21:57.560 --> 22:01.440
I don't see – and it's way too elaborate to be nonsense and I think he's probably

22:01.440 --> 22:02.440
right.

22:02.440 --> 22:04.980
But again, the timing stinks and I found that to be a real turnoff.

22:04.980 --> 22:09.440
So Mumble, I'm curious what you guys think here in the room because here we are, a bunch

22:09.440 --> 22:10.440
of Linux users.

22:10.440 --> 22:11.720
A lot of us have been around for a while.

22:11.720 --> 22:12.920
Some of us are new.

22:12.920 --> 22:17.760
But we are very clearly watching not a war but a clear –

22:17.760 --> 22:18.760
It's a pissing contest.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.080
Yeah, a clear – very much so.

22:20.080 --> 22:24.800
Like a back and forth trying to – this is obviously how an open community tries to

22:24.800 --> 22:27.600
influence each other and push a new technology forward.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.280
A lot of people have a lot riding on this.

22:29.280 --> 22:32.840
I'm kind of curious in the Mumble room if anybody has any observations on the situation

22:32.840 --> 22:37.520
or kind of any thoughts along – if some of this is maybe ill-timed or if it's maybe

22:37.520 --> 22:38.820
just the right time.

22:38.820 --> 22:39.820
Anybody have any thoughts?

22:39.820 --> 22:45.080
Yeah, actually, just – I really do – like the way Matt said, it really does seem like

22:45.080 --> 22:47.740
a pissing contest at this point.

22:47.740 --> 22:51.820
Both sides seem to be going and pushing and saying, oh, well, in this situation, this

22:51.820 --> 22:52.820
can happen.

22:52.820 --> 22:55.120
I'm monolithic and I'm not.

22:55.120 --> 23:01.100
They're both going and just saying these rather silly ideas that – one is so much

23:01.100 --> 23:02.100
better than the other.

23:02.100 --> 23:05.880
I think it really comes down to – if you use both, both work quite well.

23:05.880 --> 23:09.120
The only thing that really comes down to is the CLA, unfortunately.

23:09.120 --> 23:13.000
That's why I think why they're talking about the CLA and not the other stuff because

23:13.000 --> 23:16.240
the other stuff is really rather simple.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.800
I seem to have missed the back and forth.

23:18.800 --> 23:25.160
I seem to have only seen Leonard and Kay posting on Google+.

23:25.160 --> 23:32.040
I haven't seen anyone from Upstart posting rebuttals back the other way at all.

23:32.040 --> 23:33.040
Right.

23:33.040 --> 23:36.000
There's been a few in the comments on these threads.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.560
One of the original Upstart developers did take to his Google Plus feed and had a couple

23:40.560 --> 23:43.440
of comments to say about the CLA and things like that.

23:43.440 --> 23:49.840
You're right, it has been a lot of campaigning from one side, definitely more so, and then

23:49.840 --> 23:52.000
more of a response on the other side.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.600
I think maybe that's – maybe because some of the pro conversations for Upstart are all

23:56.600 --> 24:00.880
happening on the Debian mailing list itself, whereas the folks – where these folks don't

24:00.880 --> 24:05.280
really have an in there as much, so they're kind of using their other avenues to reach

24:05.280 --> 24:06.280
out.

24:06.280 --> 24:07.280
It's an open mailing.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.280
It's an open mailing list.

24:08.280 --> 24:13.080
Surely they could – if they wanted to lobby, that would be the right place to do it rather

24:13.080 --> 24:14.560
than on a social network.

24:14.560 --> 24:15.560
You're right.

24:15.560 --> 24:21.760
I can see that it is sort of seen as a pissing contest and whatnot, but I think if there's

24:21.760 --> 24:24.760
any time to do it, it might as well be now.

24:24.760 --> 24:27.960
So I don't see that as necessarily a bad thing.

24:27.960 --> 24:31.920
I actually think it has a lot – I think there's a lot on the line here.

24:31.920 --> 24:36.800
And I don't know why, because honestly, the more rational aspect of me also knows

24:36.800 --> 24:41.600
that it doesn't matter if Debian goes with OpenRC or Upstart or SystemD, it'll all

24:41.600 --> 24:43.160
be normalized out in the end.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.160
It'll all work out.

24:44.160 --> 24:45.160
Sure.

24:45.160 --> 24:48.720
But it does seem like now, to me, I agree that it's a little dirty on the timing,

24:48.720 --> 24:52.080
and Popey brings up a good point too, that there are actually other avenues to have this

24:52.080 --> 24:56.200
conversation other than the most public of those avenues.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.320
But I also kind of feel like at the same time, the stakes are high enough that it almost

24:59.320 --> 25:06.440
justifies it, because I'll tell you, I have no – Upstart's fine.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.440
I've used it for years.

25:08.440 --> 25:13.880
But SystemD is really quite good for a server.

25:13.880 --> 25:19.080
It has resource controls that are actually kind of absolutely essential for a server,

25:19.080 --> 25:24.640
and then it also has the capability of capturing daemon core dumps and providing those to the

25:24.640 --> 25:29.800
admin through the logging system, and also then restarting those daemons after they crash

25:29.800 --> 25:32.280
and being very intelligent about how it does that.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.680
And on top of that, it also can auto-resolve dependencies.

25:34.680 --> 25:39.100
So if several things fail, it can actually have – it actually has the intelligence

25:39.100 --> 25:41.800
to resolve the dependencies to get everything back up and running.

25:41.800 --> 25:45.280
Oh, and hey, here's your notification of what happened and what we did.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.080
And then you combine that with cgroups.

25:48.080 --> 25:54.520
You combine that with – it is honestly also a lot better at managing file system mounts.

25:54.520 --> 25:59.120
And when you live in a world of Wi-Fi and USB thumb drives, having a much more dynamic

25:59.120 --> 26:03.120
methodology of handling your file system mounts and something that's intelligent about that,

26:03.120 --> 26:05.280
and also something that's also dependency aware again.

26:05.280 --> 26:10.080
So like before it tries to mount NFS, it starts up the networking stack.

26:10.080 --> 26:16.080
Those kinds of features, it almost would seem – and I know we can solve those problems

26:16.080 --> 26:18.880
with other tools, but it seems a little silly.

26:18.880 --> 26:22.280
Like it seems like we should – all of our – all Linuxes should be able to do those

26:22.280 --> 26:23.280
things.

26:23.280 --> 26:27.080
Well, and I think a really nice collaborative effort that both parties could do is to simply

26:27.080 --> 26:31.320
work together on a flowchart on what each of their individual camps offer.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.320
Simple.

26:32.320 --> 26:33.320
Simple politics.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.320
Just keep it simple.

26:34.320 --> 26:35.320
I think that's –

26:35.320 --> 26:37.280
Because I think that'd be awesome.

26:37.280 --> 26:44.000
What's interesting there is Scott James Remnant, who was the original maintainer of Upstart,

26:44.000 --> 26:50.280
the creator of Upstart, some years back commented on – I think on Matt Garrett's post and

26:50.280 --> 26:56.560
talked about how he did have conversations with Kay and Lennart about system D.

26:56.560 --> 27:02.760
And what surprised me was most recently in the last week or so that Kay and Lennart have

27:02.760 --> 27:08.600
talked all about the CLA and how that was a big sticking point for system D, yet none

27:08.600 --> 27:16.640
of that was mentioned years ago when everyone told us that canonical were kings of not invented

27:16.640 --> 27:24.320
here and kings of fork it, when in fact they were – Kay and Lennart were talking to Scott

27:24.320 --> 27:25.960
about helping maintain –

27:25.960 --> 27:26.960
A fork.

27:26.960 --> 27:27.960
Upstart.

27:27.960 --> 27:29.760
And then they went away and –

27:29.760 --> 27:30.760
They discussed a fork, too.

27:30.760 --> 27:31.760
They made something else.

27:31.760 --> 27:32.760
Yeah, well, they also discussed forking Upstart.

27:32.760 --> 27:34.200
I mean, there was a – yeah.

27:34.200 --> 27:38.200
So I guess you're saying that you're thinking maybe the CLA is a little bit more of a ruse

27:38.200 --> 27:41.920
now that it wasn't as big of an issue back then?

27:41.920 --> 27:45.240
I think it's a good bandwagon to jump on this week, yeah.

27:45.240 --> 27:49.640
Yeah, and I think what you point out is interesting because it definitely points out that the

27:49.640 --> 27:53.200
timing, like you said, it's really recent, the timing with all the deviant stuff, it

27:53.200 --> 27:57.040
does seem like they're kind of pulling that out of their bag of dirty tricks, which –

27:57.040 --> 28:02.800
But I kind of feel like the community as a whole, now that Linus has jumped in on the

28:02.800 --> 28:05.520
whole CLA thing, too, that shit, I think it's sailed, right?

28:05.520 --> 28:09.640
I mean, now Linus has come out against CLA's, and of course, I mean, not that surprising,

28:09.640 --> 28:14.880
but that seems like a battle that – it just seems like something canonical that is not

28:14.880 --> 28:16.480
going to be able to change public opinion on that.

28:16.480 --> 28:20.320
I don't necessarily think canonical CLA – I'm not going to say whether canonical

28:20.320 --> 28:25.480
CLA is either good or bad, but I think in the case of Debian, it might be a hurdle for

28:25.480 --> 28:28.600
them even adopting something like Upstart.

28:28.600 --> 28:29.600
They would have to do –

28:29.600 --> 28:31.880
Right, and I think that is – it is a problem.

28:31.880 --> 28:32.880
Go ahead, Bobbie.

28:32.880 --> 28:33.880
I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that.

28:33.880 --> 28:39.240
They even said that the reason why they wrote Upstart – sorry, System D is because of

28:39.240 --> 28:40.680
the CLA on Upstart.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.040
That's what they're saying, but Popeye's kind of –

28:42.040 --> 28:49.320
I'm sure – sorry, I don't know whether there's satellite delay here to the UK or

28:49.320 --> 28:50.320
not.

28:50.320 --> 28:54.720
I can see how there are technical arguments for why System D is better, and I can see

28:54.720 --> 29:00.320
how there are arguments for why Upstart is better, but what surprises me that it's been

29:00.320 --> 29:04.800
left this late to come up with, oh, yeah, and what about the CLA?

29:04.800 --> 29:13.640
I mean, this stuff is all well-documented on the Debian Wiki of rationale pro and con

29:13.640 --> 29:21.160
for both products, and I would just like the Debian technical committee to get on and make

29:21.160 --> 29:22.160
a decision.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.200
I'd rather this was resolved somewhat.

29:24.200 --> 29:25.200
I agree, too.

29:25.200 --> 29:30.360
You don't go to Debian and start preaching to them about licenses and agreements.

29:30.360 --> 29:35.560
I mean, these guys, before they even got this far, are well aware of the CLA, what it means,

29:35.560 --> 29:36.560
and all of that.

29:36.560 --> 29:40.320
So it is a little odd to bring it up at this stage because it's – to me, it kind of

29:40.320 --> 29:46.120
feels like, all right, all cards out, Matt, you focus on the CLA, Lennart, you focus on

29:46.120 --> 29:47.120
the technical stuff.

29:47.120 --> 29:49.840
Now, I'm not saying there's even collusion or anything like that, but it just really

29:49.840 --> 29:52.320
seems like, all right, everybody's going to put it all out there.

29:52.320 --> 29:55.800
It gets as much noise about this as we can right now while we can.

29:55.800 --> 30:01.640
It sounds kind of like the Upstart side is more like a dog that's just kind of chilling

30:01.640 --> 30:08.200
out sleeping, and then the System D side is like the Jack Russell that just never shuts

30:08.200 --> 30:09.200
up.

30:09.200 --> 30:11.360
But it's really different.

30:11.360 --> 30:14.280
We have been talking about this – like, if you go back to the episode, we discussed

30:14.280 --> 30:15.380
this a while ago.

30:15.380 --> 30:18.240
We discussed the CLA then and how it was a big deal.

30:18.240 --> 30:20.400
I don't think it just happened overnight.

30:20.400 --> 30:23.320
It's just – this isn't – it's popped up again.

30:23.320 --> 30:27.160
Just different aspects of it are popping up again and again, and the CLA just seems to

30:27.160 --> 30:31.400
be a very strong sticking point, and everyone's kind of sticking to it and whether they like

30:31.400 --> 30:32.400
it or not.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.400
Right, and this time, too –

30:33.400 --> 30:34.400
And I can see why it is.

30:34.400 --> 30:40.360
I can see the rationale why a developer might say, or more accurately, their employer might

30:40.360 --> 30:46.840
not want them to contribute to a product where there is an asymmetrical relationship with

30:46.840 --> 30:48.560
them and the maintainer.

30:48.560 --> 30:52.120
I can understand that, and Debian have got to figure that one out.

30:52.120 --> 30:53.680
That's for them to figure out.

30:53.680 --> 31:00.520
I think, too, part of it is we are – there are a lot of engineers and technical people

31:00.520 --> 31:08.400
in the community, obviously, and when something is potentially technically superior, there's

31:08.400 --> 31:13.820
like this extra urgency to become an advocate of it, right, because – but this is technically

31:13.820 --> 31:15.760
the right thing to do.

31:15.760 --> 31:19.960
And of course, it's never always black and white like that, but that's just how people

31:19.960 --> 31:20.960
are.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.320
Like, well, how could you not implement this?

31:22.320 --> 31:24.520
This is the better, obvious way to go.

31:24.520 --> 31:28.520
So – and I think partially, too, the debate has flared back up around the CLA because

31:28.520 --> 31:30.360
there's been a pivot in the conversation.

31:30.360 --> 31:36.120
There was a bit of a, well, but look, even the FSF has a CLA, and also Apache, they have

31:36.120 --> 31:37.120
a CLA.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.340
So look, it's not that bad.

31:38.340 --> 31:43.080
And so then there was this wave of response to that claim saying, well, those don't try

31:43.080 --> 31:47.800
to relicense, or they already permit relicensing, so the CLA allowing relicensing isn't a big

31:47.800 --> 31:50.000
deal.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.560
And people are also coming out and calling it a community limiting agreement.

31:53.560 --> 31:57.400
The CLA is a community limiting agreement saying that it doesn't allow – line is saying

31:57.400 --> 32:00.520
that it doesn't allow for drive-by community growth.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.900
It's an interesting time, and it's an interesting spot, and I think there's a lot of people

32:03.900 --> 32:07.240
out there right now that are honestly just kind of like – Bobi says, like, just hurry

32:07.240 --> 32:08.240
up and vote.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.840
Let's just make a decision here.

32:09.840 --> 32:13.900
Because a lot of these things, once they blow over, are not that big of a deal.

32:13.900 --> 32:14.900
So I completely agree.

32:14.900 --> 32:17.920
It's almost like – it's almost like they need to foot the corner or something to get

32:17.920 --> 32:18.920
it over with.

32:18.920 --> 32:19.920
Right?

32:19.920 --> 32:20.920
No kidding.

32:20.920 --> 32:22.680
Well, and you know, Debian's been floating like a lot of different proposals.

32:22.680 --> 32:29.440
Like, one is, all right, default on Linux is systemd, but if you go with, like, Herd

32:29.440 --> 32:34.440
or something like that, we'll use openrc, or k-freebsd, we'll use openrc, or whatever,

32:34.440 --> 32:35.440
right?

32:35.440 --> 32:39.280
There's, like, all these different ideas they're proposing right now for – or different

32:39.280 --> 32:40.280
scenarios.

32:40.280 --> 32:44.080
And it – I don't know, it's one of these things where – and we're about to shift

32:44.080 --> 32:48.120
gears into the FUD busting, and I'll just leave it at this, and then we can move on.

32:48.120 --> 32:55.200
What I personally would like to see on the Versus-based installer, maybe an option somewhere

32:55.200 --> 32:59.200
along the lines, like, do you want to use systemd or openrc?

32:59.200 --> 33:00.200
Or something like that.

33:00.200 --> 33:01.200
That's what they need to do.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.200
Yeah, maybe.

33:02.200 --> 33:10.520
Well, that would be kind of hard to do, as packages would have to be all configurable

33:10.520 --> 33:18.120
to use either or, and generally that makes building for that – building packages for

33:18.120 --> 33:20.120
the distro a lot more complex.

33:20.120 --> 33:21.120
See, that's my question, though.

33:21.120 --> 33:22.120
I can test it out.

33:22.120 --> 33:28.040
Wouldn't – if Debian went with systemd, wouldn't Ubuntu have to repackage everything

33:28.040 --> 33:31.880
for systemd, even though they use Upstart?

33:31.880 --> 33:38.600
I don't think they would have to, because Ubuntu already, like, does all their own configuration

33:38.600 --> 33:41.440
for Upstart, because that is different to Debian at the moment.

33:41.440 --> 33:44.040
Anyway, Debian uses it, and they use Upstart.

33:44.040 --> 33:45.040
Yeah.

33:45.040 --> 33:50.400
And given we're three months away from – well, less than three months away from an LTS release,

33:50.400 --> 33:52.840
I can't see us switching between now and then.

33:52.840 --> 33:53.840
No, of course not.

33:53.840 --> 33:54.840
No.

33:54.840 --> 33:57.960
So this is – we're almost certainly going to have Upstart for the long term.

33:57.960 --> 34:03.120
For five years from now, there will still be machines – millions of machines around

34:03.120 --> 34:06.760
the world running Upstart, as there are right now.

34:06.760 --> 34:07.760
Yeah.

34:07.760 --> 34:10.840
And even more so, because more people will deploy the new LTS.

34:10.840 --> 34:15.520
And there's Chromebooks selling, like, Bazingas right now, so they're pumping those things

34:15.520 --> 34:18.280
out like nuts, and those are all running Upstart.

34:18.280 --> 34:19.600
That's why it's not a huge, huge deal.

34:19.600 --> 34:22.440
I'll just leave it at this before we get to the FUD-busting aspect of it, and that

34:22.440 --> 34:26.880
is there are elements of diversity in Linux.

34:26.880 --> 34:30.820
We always say choice is great, and I would hate to ever see those go away.

34:30.820 --> 34:36.080
There's also, you know, this loud mantra that Linux is fractured, it's fragmented,

34:36.080 --> 34:39.660
it's too hard to develop for because it's all over the place, and the more we can kind

34:39.660 --> 34:43.520
of standardize on areas that make sense, the less we – or the more, I should say, we

34:43.520 --> 34:45.220
nullify those arguments.

34:45.220 --> 34:48.720
So there is some rationale there, but that's all down the road.

34:48.720 --> 34:49.920
That's all down the road, sir.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.400
And the great thing is, like we always say, you do have choice.

34:52.400 --> 34:55.800
Hell, you could even run System D on Debian right now if you wanted to.

34:55.800 --> 34:59.080
It is actually possible.

34:59.080 --> 35:01.520
OpenRCE taking kind of a beating in some of these discussions.

35:01.520 --> 35:02.520
I'll just put that out there.

35:02.520 --> 35:03.520
Yeah, it really is, isn't it?

35:03.520 --> 35:04.520
Yeah.

35:04.520 --> 35:06.800
Speaking of the FUD busting, I want to thank DigitalOcean.

35:06.800 --> 35:11.760
DigitalOcean is simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

35:11.760 --> 35:13.200
to spin up a cloud server.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.920
Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds.

35:15.920 --> 35:16.920
Now I'm not trying to brag.

35:16.920 --> 35:19.360
I think I got that down to 47 seconds.

35:19.360 --> 35:20.360
What's up?

35:20.360 --> 35:27.120
And pricing plans start at only $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD,

35:27.120 --> 35:30.120
and one CPU with a terabyte of transfer.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.320
I love that part right there.

35:32.320 --> 35:34.400
A terabyte of transfer is nuts.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.400
First of all.

35:35.400 --> 35:39.480
And the other nice thing, as opposed to some of the other services that you spin up at

35:39.480 --> 35:44.200
Amazon or Rackspace or some of these other guys, you don't have a quantified cost there.

35:44.200 --> 35:50.120
I know every single month my DigitalOcean bill is $5 a month.

35:50.120 --> 35:53.200
And that's if I use 500 megabytes or I use a terabyte.

35:53.200 --> 35:58.620
I don't have that surprise bill on my credit card that burns you eventually with a lot

35:58.620 --> 35:59.620
of these other services.

35:59.620 --> 36:03.320
Not only that, but this is a full virtual machine that you get to operate with root

36:03.320 --> 36:04.320
access.

36:04.320 --> 36:08.160
You can use Ubuntu machines, Arch machines, Fedora machines, you can deploy machines with

36:08.160 --> 36:12.840
Docker instances already set up and good to go, LAMP stacks, whatever you need to get

36:12.840 --> 36:14.520
up and running super fast.

36:14.520 --> 36:19.520
Not only that, but DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco and Amsterdam.

36:19.520 --> 36:23.240
Their interface is simple with an intuitive control panel which power users can replicate

36:23.240 --> 36:27.240
on a large scale with their straightforward API, which is awesome.

36:27.240 --> 36:30.440
They have image solutions where if you want to create a machine and image it and you can

36:30.440 --> 36:34.120
redeploy that machine, you can do a backup snapshot before you make big changes.

36:34.120 --> 36:37.600
It's so great for testing something on the fly to have a lot of people pound on it.

36:37.600 --> 36:40.580
If you're developing a project or an app and you want to give a lot of people access

36:40.580 --> 36:43.760
to it, you want to just have somebody use it in a public space, sometimes you got to

36:43.760 --> 36:45.360
get things out on the web to really test it.

36:45.360 --> 36:49.400
DigitalOcean is perfect for that or if you want to set up a YASI search engine or in

36:49.400 --> 36:53.200
my case a BitTorrent Sync distribution server, it's great for that too.

36:53.200 --> 36:56.460
DigitalOcean also offers a vast collection of tutorials in their community section on

36:56.460 --> 36:57.640
their site.

36:57.640 --> 37:01.920
Furthermore, users who submit articles to the community can get paid $50 per published

37:01.920 --> 37:02.920
piece.

37:02.920 --> 37:03.920
So here's what I want you to do.

37:03.920 --> 37:06.400
Go to DigitalOcean.com and get a $10 credit.

37:06.400 --> 37:09.680
If you use the $5 rig like I've been using, that'll get it for you two months.

37:09.680 --> 37:15.520
You can just try it out and see what you can do if you use the promo code LinuxUnpluggedJanuary.

37:15.520 --> 37:19.040
LinuxUnpluggedJanuary will get you a $10 credit, boom!

37:19.040 --> 37:22.920
Try out DigitalOcean for two months and see what I've been talking about.

37:22.920 --> 37:24.760
I love it and you will love it too.

37:24.760 --> 37:29.560
So go to DigitalOcean.com and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux

37:29.560 --> 37:31.200
Unplugged.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.960
So many cool things you can do when you have your own cloud server.

37:33.960 --> 37:34.960
Oh, no kidding.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.860
I mean, because you're really unleashed at that point.

37:36.860 --> 37:41.000
You no longer have to worry about any potential downtime or anything on your local system.

37:41.000 --> 37:43.520
You can get creative and try completely awful stuff.

37:43.520 --> 37:48.200
With that crazy great control panel with super simple straightforward imaging and snapshotting,

37:48.200 --> 37:49.480
it is so easy.

37:49.480 --> 37:53.120
If you're worried you're going to do something wrong, you'd make a backup of it first.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.880
You can redeploy if you made a mistake.

37:54.880 --> 37:55.880
It's really great.

37:55.880 --> 37:57.120
There are so many cool options too.

37:57.120 --> 37:58.340
You can play with arch boxes.

37:58.340 --> 37:59.880
That's what I've been running for months now.

37:59.880 --> 38:00.880
It's great.

38:00.880 --> 38:02.960
It's been crazy, but it's actually been great.

38:02.960 --> 38:03.960
So check it out.

38:03.960 --> 38:04.960
DigitalOcean.com.

38:04.960 --> 38:07.080
So before we go too much further, also I want to mention really quick.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.760
It's one of our last call outs.

38:08.760 --> 38:14.000
We have an Instagram account, a Jupiter Broadcasting Instagram account, Instagram.com slash Jupiter

38:14.000 --> 38:19.400
Broadcasting, where right now we are collecting photos of folks who are sporting their Jupiter

38:19.400 --> 38:21.240
Broadcasting shirts.

38:21.240 --> 38:22.840
A lot of good looking individuals there.

38:22.840 --> 38:25.780
Some with copious amounts of facial hair.

38:25.780 --> 38:27.680
Or is that real facial hair?

38:27.680 --> 38:32.600
You know, I let things grow out a little bit and I thought I would try the whole beard

38:32.600 --> 38:34.400
thing and yeah, that happened.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.200
Well hey, it's a good look for you.

38:36.200 --> 38:37.200
It's a good look for you.

38:37.200 --> 38:38.200
Oh my God.

38:38.200 --> 38:39.200
Yeah, right?

38:39.200 --> 38:44.200
Yeah, I totally took a selfie and that was me without my beard braid.

38:44.200 --> 38:49.000
There's somebody in a data center closet with a BSD logo in the background there and it

38:49.000 --> 38:51.760
looks like a homemade disk chassis there too.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.880
There's a lot of really cool ones.

38:53.880 --> 38:54.880
Very Blues Brothers.

38:54.880 --> 38:55.880
I love it.

38:55.880 --> 38:59.800
Wherever you want to post it, or if you want to email it to Angela at JupiterBroadcasting.com

38:59.800 --> 39:05.600
or post it on G Plus and tag plus Angela Fisher or at A-N-G-E-R-Z on Twitter, let her see

39:05.600 --> 39:07.160
it and she'll add it to our Instagram feed.

39:07.160 --> 39:13.240
We're going to take these and there's a service that will allow you to create framed art.

39:13.240 --> 39:16.960
So you feed it your Instagram account and they create you art that you can hang on your

39:16.960 --> 39:22.160
wall and we're going to decorate the new studio with pictures of folks wearing their shirts.

39:22.160 --> 39:25.440
So if you'd like to hang on the wall in our new studio, get your picture submitted and

39:25.440 --> 39:31.680
you can check out everyone's pictures over at Instagram.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

39:31.680 --> 39:34.600
It's really cool seeing everybody's face in there.

39:34.600 --> 39:37.160
And some of the images are just fantastic.

39:37.160 --> 39:38.240
Super funny.

39:38.240 --> 39:39.240
Super super funny.

39:39.240 --> 39:45.120
Okay, so we got to bust some FUD bit by bit here.

39:45.120 --> 39:48.320
Now I'm going to pick on this guy, but he totally deserves it.

39:48.320 --> 39:49.320
His name is FM87.

39:49.320 --> 39:57.040
You might have saw his comment on Reddit recently when the link to Microsoft employees reportedly

39:57.040 --> 39:59.280
calling Windows 8 the new Vista hit Reddit.

39:59.280 --> 40:04.760
A lot of Windows fanboys got pretty upset by this post and of course the conversation

40:04.760 --> 40:09.400
quickly turned to bashing Linux and pushing on a bunch of old buttons.

40:09.400 --> 40:12.880
This guy got gold five times over for this post.

40:12.880 --> 40:19.120
He got 1,800 karma points for it and the reason why I'm picking on this one is because it's

40:19.120 --> 40:24.040
a great summary of a lot of the different ones, a lot of different FUD points, talking

40:24.040 --> 40:25.040
points I've seen.

40:25.040 --> 40:32.800
First, he likes to pick on the fragmentation and with a lot of profanity he links to the

40:32.800 --> 40:38.240
GNU Linux distribution timeline and says, what the actual F. Look at this and points

40:38.240 --> 40:43.560
to this and points how this is a serious sign of absolutely horrible fragmentation.

40:43.560 --> 40:46.900
Look at all of these distros that are all branched off each other.

40:46.900 --> 40:53.240
This is a developer's nightmare he goes on to say and he says, near 95% of games will

40:53.240 --> 40:56.280
not run under Linux and wine is garbage.

40:56.280 --> 40:58.840
Try running anything that requires DirectX 10 or 11.

40:58.840 --> 41:02.820
It makes extensive use of things such as hardware cursors and you'll find that they simply do

41:02.820 --> 41:05.960
not run save for very rare occurrences.

41:05.960 --> 41:09.320
Even if they do run, it usually runs with a multitude of graphical or audio glitches

41:09.320 --> 41:11.960
and bugs and even interfering with gameplay.

41:11.960 --> 41:17.800
Okay, so this is one of my favorite Linux FUD things where you take an application,

41:17.800 --> 41:22.760
any kind, could be a game, could be a desktop office application, written for another operating

41:22.760 --> 41:27.320
system and you run it on Linux and it doesn't run perfectly and you blame Linux.

41:27.320 --> 41:30.000
In no other operating system would this ever happen.

41:30.000 --> 41:34.720
You would not take an application only written for Linux or only written for the Mac and

41:34.720 --> 41:39.040
use some sort of API translation layer on Windows 7 and when it doesn't work correctly

41:39.040 --> 41:40.400
blame Windows.

41:40.400 --> 41:41.400
That wouldn't happen.

41:41.400 --> 41:42.400
Never happens.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.400
Never happens.

41:43.400 --> 41:47.360
The biggest issue is the fact they tried to underline it because it's adding an extra

41:47.360 --> 41:53.800
layer that eats up resources that the game could be using.

41:53.800 --> 41:58.400
And the developers who make stuff work on, like Cygwin for example, that makes it work

41:58.400 --> 42:02.240
on Windows, they actually made it work correctly so you don't have to worry about that.

42:02.240 --> 42:09.400
A lot of it on games too is if you're using DirectX 9 it needs DirectX 10 or 11.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.560
Linux is terrible so that's why.

42:11.560 --> 42:17.520
A better example would be like what if I were to blame Microsoft for Apple's terrible port

42:17.520 --> 42:18.520
of Safari.

42:18.520 --> 42:19.520
Or iTunes.

42:19.520 --> 42:20.520
Right?

42:20.520 --> 42:21.520
Yeah.

42:21.520 --> 42:23.320
Here's the simplest way to look at it in the universe and completely nukes this entire

42:23.320 --> 42:24.440
first point.

42:24.440 --> 42:25.720
Is it designed to run natively?

42:25.720 --> 42:26.720
No?

42:26.720 --> 42:27.720
Then go home.

42:27.720 --> 42:28.720
End of discussion.

42:28.720 --> 42:29.720
That's the simplest.

42:29.720 --> 42:35.840
That's another point which is a lot of people think that they can just switch to Linux and

42:35.840 --> 42:43.840
it's just an operating system designed for them to run their Windows software and a lot

42:43.840 --> 42:50.520
of people have that opinion for some reason just because there are ways to do it available.

42:50.520 --> 42:58.240
Or there are people who think this is an operating system where they can do everything the same

42:58.240 --> 43:03.360
as they did in Windows which is simply not true and some of your old habits will have

43:03.360 --> 43:07.320
to change if you are going to change operating systems.

43:07.320 --> 43:10.720
That's when I point out and say oh that's fantastic so let's take a copy of let's say

43:10.720 --> 43:14.640
Publisher made for Windows and we're going to go ahead and drop that in the Mac and we're

43:14.640 --> 43:15.880
just going to go ahead and get started with that.

43:15.880 --> 43:17.240
Oh that's right it doesn't work.

43:17.240 --> 43:18.240
Why?

43:18.240 --> 43:19.240
Because it didn't run native.

43:19.240 --> 43:22.360
You can nullify his argument really quickly just by putting it out.

43:22.360 --> 43:23.360
Oh yeah.

43:23.360 --> 43:24.360
Alright so what do you think of this one?

43:24.360 --> 43:25.360
Oh go ahead.

43:25.360 --> 43:29.280
If I could just butt in I was just reading through that comment you made about wine being

43:29.280 --> 43:30.280
garbage.

43:30.280 --> 43:34.280
I have a personal experience relating to that where a friend of mine, the guy I was talking

43:34.280 --> 43:39.120
about before the show plays World of Warcraft, he uses Linux to play World of Warcraft on

43:39.120 --> 43:45.120
wine because wine now has a patch that you can compile into it which makes World of Warcraft

43:45.120 --> 43:54.160
run about 40 to 50 percent faster on Linux than what it does on Windows because they've

43:54.160 --> 43:58.640
managed to multi-thread a whole bunch of stuff that Windows can't do because Windows CPU

43:58.640 --> 44:01.560
scheduler is garbage and Linux is one.

44:01.560 --> 44:05.240
And I think that wine is a lot like a VM is that it's what you see is what you get.

44:05.240 --> 44:06.240
It may or may not work.

44:06.240 --> 44:10.000
I mean obviously there's databases and what not to make sure and in a lot of games cases

44:10.000 --> 44:11.000
that's actually the case.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.240
I've actually seen other games that have run actually quicker but I think that at the end

44:14.240 --> 44:18.480
of the day it is not a guarantee that it's going to run and people going into wine need

44:18.480 --> 44:19.480
to understand that.

44:19.480 --> 44:20.480
That's not even an argument.

44:20.480 --> 44:26.360
When someone actually is able to run an application under wine it's like complaining that your

44:26.360 --> 44:32.800
engine or diesel engine can actually run on corn oil or water.

44:32.800 --> 44:36.000
There's a reason why I run a different operating system on my different machines.

44:36.000 --> 44:40.100
My laptop is purely Linux but my desktop I'm going to run Windows on it because I want

44:40.100 --> 44:45.440
access to those DirectX games or I want to use multimedia services like Netflix because

44:45.440 --> 44:46.960
it's my main entertainment.

44:46.960 --> 44:50.560
And I think the other policy he has here is he starts out his thread and I'm going to

44:50.560 --> 44:51.560
get to another point here.

44:51.560 --> 44:57.320
He says Linux is not a replacement for 99.999% of users and then he mentions this 95% of

44:57.320 --> 45:01.280
games won't work under wine and it's like hold on.

45:01.280 --> 45:02.560
Not all users need that.

45:02.560 --> 45:06.120
So here you're making an argument that it won't work for 99% of people then you're assuming

45:06.120 --> 45:07.920
99% of people need to play wine games.

45:07.920 --> 45:13.320
He also goes on to say despite what most Linux users would lead everyone to believe most

45:13.320 --> 45:16.760
users just want to start up and set up and go OS.

45:16.760 --> 45:18.520
Linux is not this.

45:18.520 --> 45:21.920
Yes, Windows needs to push updates and restart but so does Linux.

45:21.920 --> 45:25.920
The difference is Linux will not tell you it needs to restart to update kernel files

45:25.920 --> 45:30.600
leaving those vulnerable until you do so or simply causing a kernel panic or lock up.

45:30.600 --> 45:33.760
The amount of setup required and tinkering needed to get things like sound and network

45:33.760 --> 45:37.360
drivers working properly after initial setup is mind boggling.

45:37.360 --> 45:40.740
Even on easy distros like Ubuntu, Kubuntu or Mint.

45:40.740 --> 45:45.280
So on the first point he's factually completely and utterly and totally wrong because as soon

45:45.280 --> 45:49.800
as you install updates, if it does require a reboot in Ubuntu, wait for it, it does tell

45:49.800 --> 45:50.800
you.

45:50.800 --> 45:56.320
Secondly, as far as coming out of the box, my mom who collects social security and is

45:56.320 --> 46:02.000
like old as dirt, she installed her own Ubuntu installation so boom there it is.

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
It was really tough.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.560
She put the disk in, went and made lunch, came back, clicked next a few times and she

46:06.560 --> 46:07.560
was done.

46:07.560 --> 46:12.040
It wasn't real hard so his entire point is just completely flawed.

46:12.040 --> 46:13.040
It's not accurate.

46:13.040 --> 46:18.160
My first point is 105% of statistics are made up on the spot.

46:18.160 --> 46:25.480
It's worth noting that on Ubuntu we've actually re-implemented the Windows dialog that prevents

46:25.480 --> 46:32.960
you from dismissing it and you have to, you know, what do you want, you know?

46:32.960 --> 46:33.960
You must restart.

46:33.960 --> 46:39.360
Ubuntu is way easier to setup than Windows 8 is because you don't have to make a million

46:39.360 --> 46:45.560
Microsoft accounts per se and as soon as you log in, it'll say the upstart menu.

46:45.560 --> 46:46.560
Right.

46:46.560 --> 46:50.960
And you know what real users hate is when you go to shut down your computer and then

46:50.960 --> 46:53.400
it installs the updates.

46:53.400 --> 46:54.880
Real users actually hate that.

46:54.880 --> 46:55.880
Yeah, it sucks, right?

46:55.880 --> 46:56.880
And especially when you're on a laptop.

46:56.880 --> 47:03.440
When you just flick your machine on because you need to use it for two minutes and all

47:03.440 --> 47:07.000
of a sudden you've got to wait half an hour for it to turn on because it decided to do

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
some updates.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.000
I hate that.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.760
So Popey, somebody brought up the point of Microsoft accounts.

47:11.760 --> 47:15.320
They're not going to require canonical accounts, are they?

47:15.320 --> 47:18.600
You can already sign into Ubuntu One during your install.

47:18.600 --> 47:21.600
No, it's a convenience.

47:21.600 --> 47:24.560
Yeah, it's a total choice.

47:24.560 --> 47:27.280
It's not mandatory by any stretch of the word.

47:27.280 --> 47:29.880
I got a couple of points where he is right.

47:29.880 --> 47:33.800
So synergy with other devices such as network file sharing has always been an issue with

47:33.800 --> 47:38.160
Linux where Windows's small office can simply turn on file sharing, the procedure for doing

47:38.160 --> 47:39.960
this with Linux is long and tedious.

47:39.960 --> 47:42.040
Now I think this is a fair point.

47:42.040 --> 47:47.600
New users that want to share files between two Linux desktops have no idea where to do

47:47.600 --> 47:50.920
that and they always just end up emailing each other in attachment or use Dropbox.

47:50.920 --> 47:51.920
Yeah, but so do Windows users.

47:51.920 --> 47:52.920
I mean, honestly.

47:52.920 --> 47:55.360
Actually, that's a good point.

47:55.360 --> 48:01.240
Every office I've ever worked in, the ability to turn on file sharing has been an excellent

48:01.240 --> 48:05.000
vector for installing viruses on every other machine on the network.

48:05.000 --> 48:06.000
It's brilliant.

48:06.000 --> 48:07.000
Okay.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.320
What about locking down the OS?

48:08.320 --> 48:12.120
He says in an enterprise environment, you can never be done that.

48:12.120 --> 48:13.120
Check out this.

48:13.120 --> 48:16.960
It can never be done due to how the FOSS community behaves and thinks everything should be out

48:16.960 --> 48:17.960
in the open.

48:17.960 --> 48:21.160
This is a huge problem, he says.

48:21.160 --> 48:25.240
That's utter bull crap.

48:25.240 --> 48:30.340
That's like saying I don't want to see how this thing works so that no one else can see

48:30.340 --> 48:34.560
how it works, even though it might be just like a feather holding the safe closed.

48:34.560 --> 48:36.400
It's like that's just silly.

48:36.400 --> 48:38.240
You don't know if it's a feather holding the safe closed.

48:38.240 --> 48:39.400
You don't know if it's a steel bar.

48:39.400 --> 48:41.240
You don't know how it's built.

48:41.240 --> 48:42.720
How can you rely on it at all?

48:42.720 --> 48:45.320
I think he's talking like group policy and stuff like that.

48:45.320 --> 48:46.320
But okay.

48:46.320 --> 48:47.320
All right.

48:47.320 --> 48:48.320
Here's a soft spot.

48:48.320 --> 48:49.320
All right.

48:49.320 --> 48:50.320
Now, come on.

48:50.320 --> 48:51.320
Be honest with this one, you guys.

48:51.320 --> 48:55.000
He says, despite what most Linux users say, the command line is still required to use

48:55.000 --> 48:57.120
for a lot of common tasks.

48:57.120 --> 48:59.920
This is a huge problem in all caps.

48:59.920 --> 49:04.160
No one gives an S about memorizing 100 different commands to do simple things.

49:04.160 --> 49:08.880
The average user needs a simple GUI with everything laid out for them and Linux simply does not

49:08.880 --> 49:10.120
offer that.

49:10.120 --> 49:13.360
The average person will have to use command line eventually.

49:13.360 --> 49:14.360
But that's not true.

49:14.360 --> 49:20.040
I've, again, going back to my mom who maintains her own computer, believe it or not, with

49:20.040 --> 49:23.040
the exception of router issues, that's not related to Ubuntu.

49:23.040 --> 49:28.880
But factually speaking, I would challenge most common users will use the command line

49:28.880 --> 49:32.600
like maybe never unless they know what to do with it.

49:32.600 --> 49:35.880
The entire argument kind of kills itself right off the bat just because it's like, okay,

49:35.880 --> 49:39.320
so you're relying on the command line, yet you're new to Linux and you don't know what

49:39.320 --> 49:42.680
commands you're going to be using anyway, so then you're going to go Google for it.

49:42.680 --> 49:43.680
That doesn't really hold water.

49:43.680 --> 49:45.080
Here's a perfect example.

49:45.080 --> 49:50.440
Back in 2006 when I first ran Ubuntu, I had to use a terminal to get things like my wireless

49:50.440 --> 49:51.440
working.

49:51.440 --> 49:52.440
Oh, yeah.

49:52.440 --> 49:53.440
Back then.

49:53.440 --> 49:54.440
Absolutely.

49:54.440 --> 49:59.640
Here in 2014, for me to use a terminal, that's my choice because I prefer to use some of

49:59.640 --> 50:01.800
those tools over the GUI tools.

50:01.800 --> 50:12.840
I would like to add to what Matt said that I actually like helping people who use Linux

50:12.840 --> 50:21.600
over the phone or over Skype because I don't care where they move their icons or where

50:21.600 --> 50:22.880
their start menu is.

50:22.880 --> 50:28.200
I don't have to wait until they click on something.

50:28.200 --> 50:34.720
Whether they themselves use terminal commands or not is irrelevant, but if I need to help

50:34.720 --> 50:39.840
them fix something, I can just tell them, open the terminal, type this in, and it makes

50:39.840 --> 50:41.840
helping others so much easier.

50:41.840 --> 50:48.800
I think one of the misconceptions that Windows advocates have when they throw mud at Linux

50:48.800 --> 50:54.060
is they set it to a different standard and they say, well, on Linux you need the command

50:54.060 --> 50:59.840
line, and part of the reason for that is the perception that someone who uses Linux has

50:59.840 --> 51:00.840
to be an expert.

51:00.840 --> 51:05.000
My mom's been using Linux for three years and she's never, ever opened a command line

51:05.000 --> 51:09.720
because she knows someone who can do it for her, and that's exactly the same on Windows.

51:09.720 --> 51:12.040
If my mom ran Windows, she'd phone me.

51:12.040 --> 51:13.040
I think you've nailed it.

51:13.040 --> 51:18.000
To bring up a point about even this Linux kernel being used in different places, I just

51:18.000 --> 51:23.920
throw at them, okay, do you use the terminal on your phone, on your Android device?

51:23.920 --> 51:31.040
I want to point out too, I think that it is just about as difficult for a new Linux user

51:31.040 --> 51:32.040
to use the command line.

51:32.040 --> 51:33.560
I know this is going to sound crazy, but think about it.

51:33.560 --> 51:34.560
I think it's true.

51:34.560 --> 51:38.320
It's just as hard for a new Linux user to use the command line as it is an absolute

51:38.320 --> 51:45.720
noob to go hunt down a printer driver, download it from the, select the right type, download

51:45.720 --> 51:49.240
it from the manufacturer's website, install that printer driver.

51:49.240 --> 51:52.880
Linux users don't have to worry about any of that kind of thing, whereas on Windows,

51:52.880 --> 51:57.560
when you get a new device or a new machine, that is a very common task that they immediately

51:57.560 --> 51:59.200
get stuck at.

51:59.200 --> 52:02.840
Installing printers is surprisingly difficult, or installing new devices when you have to

52:02.840 --> 52:07.660
go get the driver that doesn't install from Windows Update, that might as well just not

52:07.660 --> 52:10.840
work at all for a lot of new users, and that's, of course, never criticized.

52:10.840 --> 52:15.880
Well, if I can give a recent example of that, just recently I got a new computer, it was

52:15.880 --> 52:19.800
just a cheap one, just to throw in the lounge, the living room, just to run Netflix, that's

52:19.800 --> 52:25.000
all it does because flatmates watch Netflix, and I had a Wi-Fi dongle that I was going

52:25.000 --> 52:28.240
to plug into it and just use that because I couldn't be bothered with running the cable,

52:28.240 --> 52:33.480
and I had the Wi-Fi dongle and the CD that the drivers came on, and I installed Windows,

52:33.480 --> 52:38.600
I plugged in the Wi-Fi dongle, popped the CD in, it didn't work, I went into the CD,

52:38.600 --> 52:42.080
I went through, I mean, I've been using Windows for 15 years now, I know how to install a

52:42.080 --> 52:47.680
driver, and eventually after about an hour of messing around with the driver, I popped

52:47.680 --> 52:53.920
an Ubuntu USB stick in, plugged the Wi-Fi in, it worked instantly, downloaded Pipelight,

52:53.920 --> 52:57.080
and she's now watching Netflix on Ubuntu, I meant to put Windows on because she knows

52:57.080 --> 53:00.200
how to use Windows, she doesn't know how to use Linux, and I just thought it would be

53:00.200 --> 53:04.440
easier and smoother and everything, and honestly, it took me an hour, and I gave up, and I used

53:04.440 --> 53:09.600
Linux because it worked, so in terms of installing drivers and such and having to use the command

53:09.600 --> 53:15.800
line like you save, I mean, I'm not even a new Windows user, but having to dig around

53:15.800 --> 53:20.440
in the Windows driver options and reboot into insecure mode and all that stuff just to get

53:20.440 --> 53:22.160
a driver installed in Linux, there wasn't a problem.

53:22.160 --> 53:26.120
Well, Linux is very weird and different when it comes to Windows, and a lot of people don't

53:26.120 --> 53:27.640
actually understand this.

53:27.640 --> 53:33.120
The kernel is all hardware abstraction, and the user land is all user-facing tools.

53:33.120 --> 53:38.200
When you upgrade your kernel, that upgrades all hardware support.

53:38.200 --> 53:43.240
That's why all of our hardware product plays so instant and beautiful and modern.

53:43.240 --> 53:47.960
Okay, Crash Bandit, could I have one question about your pipeline setup on that?

53:47.960 --> 53:52.120
How well does hardware acceleration for HD video work?

53:52.120 --> 53:54.800
I don't have hardware acceleration work.

53:54.800 --> 53:56.280
My driver doesn't support it.

53:56.280 --> 53:57.280
All right.

53:57.280 --> 53:58.280
Yeah, that is...

53:58.280 --> 53:59.600
I was curious about that, too.

53:59.600 --> 54:00.600
I wanted...

54:00.600 --> 54:02.000
That would be for our GPU.

54:02.000 --> 54:05.120
One last thing I wanted to bring up as far as we were talking about Wi-Fi earlier, because

54:05.120 --> 54:10.620
that's one thing that Linux users kind of skate over and always point to various tools

54:10.620 --> 54:13.040
to kind of work around Windows drivers and whatnot.

54:13.040 --> 54:16.240
At the end of the day, if you look at your laptop, you open up the clamshell and you

54:16.240 --> 54:19.400
look really closely at the sticker on it, what does it say it's made for?

54:19.400 --> 54:21.440
It says it's made for Windows.

54:21.440 --> 54:25.300
Going into it, you understand that the chipset and the sound and all those things are potentially

54:25.300 --> 54:27.240
designed for the Windows operating system.

54:27.240 --> 54:31.280
That usually means you're probably working with a Broadcom chipset when it comes to wireless.

54:31.280 --> 54:32.280
Sometimes that works.

54:32.280 --> 54:36.180
Sometimes you're looking at going and having to connect to a hard line and get it the otherwise.

54:36.180 --> 54:40.600
The simplest approach is either buy Linux preinstalled or accept the fact that if you

54:40.600 --> 54:45.120
want to have a good time, get yourself an integrated Intel wireless setup.

54:45.120 --> 54:49.200
Or if you need to go dongle wise, you can kind of crap roll it and go with a Theros

54:49.200 --> 54:50.200
or a Rawlink.

54:50.200 --> 54:51.200
It's true.

54:51.200 --> 54:53.000
There are methods to avoid some of these problems too.

54:53.000 --> 54:59.120
You know, BlueGuy in the chat room says, if you log into Windows Server 2012 and it decides

54:59.120 --> 55:02.500
to shut down your entire company in 10 minutes for updates, trust me, you'll be using the

55:02.500 --> 55:03.500
command line.

55:03.500 --> 55:08.040
This is an interesting thing is Microsoft is actually very heavily pushing PowerShell

55:08.040 --> 55:12.560
and a lot of the new ways to administer Active Directory, everything you can do through the

55:12.560 --> 55:14.280
GUI, you can do at the command line.

55:14.280 --> 55:18.560
And a lot of it's around scripting and PowerShell for managing updates and things like that.

55:18.560 --> 55:21.240
So in fact, then look at Windows Server Core.

55:21.240 --> 55:23.320
That's also sort of addressing this.

55:23.320 --> 55:26.200
You know, a server doesn't necessarily need this GUI aspect.

55:26.200 --> 55:29.700
So I think there's, I think it's a little funny to push the command line thing because

55:29.700 --> 55:33.600
really a lot of times I've had to drop to CMD on Windows 7.

55:33.600 --> 55:34.600
Oh yeah.

55:34.600 --> 55:35.600
That's what I do.

55:35.600 --> 55:40.400
Pigret Dull would like to share a story about his friend with GUI versus Terminal.

55:40.400 --> 55:41.880
All right.

55:41.880 --> 55:42.880
Okay.

55:42.880 --> 55:47.240
I had a friend who got fed up with Windows.

55:47.240 --> 55:49.760
He got a virus and said, I'm done.

55:49.760 --> 55:54.600
And so I pointed him towards Linux Mint just as a new user.

55:54.600 --> 56:00.360
And he actually prefers the Terminal over the GUI, at least with installing software

56:00.360 --> 56:01.600
because he says it's a lot easier.

56:01.600 --> 56:02.600
Oh, it definitely is.

56:02.600 --> 56:08.400
If you're on Pacman or something, or even an app, it's so much faster than having to

56:08.400 --> 56:10.040
go through the software center.

56:10.040 --> 56:11.040
Yeah.

56:11.040 --> 56:12.040
That sounds pretty geeky though.

56:12.040 --> 56:13.040
But I mean, I agree.

56:13.040 --> 56:16.840
And I also, you know, maybe it's funny because users used to use DOS, right?

56:16.840 --> 56:20.200
So it's not like they can't be taught to use the command line.

56:20.200 --> 56:21.200
All right.

56:21.200 --> 56:22.320
Here's the soft spot that he goes for.

56:22.320 --> 56:23.520
This is the one I've been talking about.

56:23.520 --> 56:28.440
He says, distros are largely fragmented and the popular ones will come with random issues

56:28.440 --> 56:31.840
depending on what you are using and what you are installing on it.

56:31.840 --> 56:34.160
So always has issues with newer audio devices.

56:34.160 --> 56:38.920
Ubuntu and Mint tend to go ape shit if the display resolution or gamma is not set properly.

56:38.920 --> 56:41.960
And Arch almost always has had networking device problems.

56:41.960 --> 56:45.440
Soos seems to randomly play nice with USB mice and then ignore them as if they don't

56:45.440 --> 56:46.440
exist.

56:46.440 --> 56:49.400
And this is just the list off the top of my head.

56:49.400 --> 56:50.400
Easy answer to that one.

56:50.400 --> 56:51.400
Very, very simple.

56:51.400 --> 56:54.720
He basically installed all these distributions on one set of hardware.

56:54.720 --> 56:58.920
He had bad experiences because everything he named off very, very clearly tells me that

56:58.920 --> 57:00.800
he did not try this on multiple machines.

57:00.800 --> 57:05.040
He tried it on one piece of hardware, had a bad time, said Linux sucks, you know.

57:05.040 --> 57:06.040
Yeah, exactly.

57:06.040 --> 57:10.560
I honestly, I think he's just straight up lying when he says some of that stuff because

57:10.560 --> 57:15.080
I don't know how he can say Fedora always has issues with newer audio.

57:15.080 --> 57:19.800
Fedora always has the newest kernel and so it always has the best new hardware support.

57:19.800 --> 57:21.240
He's picking on the Pulse Audio issue from years ago.

57:21.240 --> 57:24.360
He's picking on Pulse Audio because if you're trying to connect to a USB situation, it gets

57:24.360 --> 57:25.360
a little funky.

57:25.360 --> 57:29.040
I think Fedora, I mean, I haven't really tried it myself, but I've heard Fedora has gotten

57:29.040 --> 57:34.080
a lot better lately, especially since they include the newer Radeon drivers by default

57:34.080 --> 57:38.160
and those have improved drastically because that was my biggest issue back in like 2008.

57:38.160 --> 57:42.480
Well, and remember, we just talked about on the, so this fragmentation thing comes up

57:42.480 --> 57:43.480
all the time.

57:43.480 --> 57:49.120
This is like sort of the common, you know, against all of the FUD talkers, the distro

57:49.120 --> 57:55.680
fragmentation is always brought up all the time, but we just talked about this presentation

57:55.680 --> 58:05.800
at the Valve Dev, Steam Dev Days and in there, Ikyulys said that, hey, look, honestly, this

58:05.800 --> 58:11.440
fragmentation issue amongst distros is BS and this guy has been porting games from Windows

58:11.440 --> 58:19.200
to Linux for 15 years and he says, you know, OpenGL and SDL, they essentially normalize

58:19.200 --> 58:20.200
things out.

58:20.200 --> 58:21.200
It really doesn't matter.

58:21.200 --> 58:24.720
He called it, I'm looking for the word, I think he called it a myth.

58:24.720 --> 58:29.560
His presentation is linked in this week's episode of Linux Action Show.

58:29.560 --> 58:30.560
Myth busting.

58:30.560 --> 58:31.560
Yeah, he called it a myth.

58:31.560 --> 58:35.040
He said, the truth about distro fragmentation, I've shipped dozens of games over 15 years,

58:35.040 --> 58:38.320
never did anything but generic Linux builds for any game.

58:38.320 --> 58:39.320
It's always worked.

58:39.320 --> 58:43.800
SDL handles most of the differences for you and the rest is largely avoidable and unimportant

58:43.800 --> 58:44.800
anyhow.

58:44.800 --> 58:46.760
So there you go, right?

58:46.760 --> 58:51.400
That's from somebody who's been converting games for 15 years from Windows.

58:51.400 --> 58:54.760
And just to point out, it's like he's going and he's saying, all these Linux distros are

58:54.760 --> 58:55.760
just awful.

58:55.760 --> 59:02.200
I would challenge him that if you go and take Windows 7, Windows 8, whatever you want, go

59:02.200 --> 59:06.460
and put it on multiple different hardware configurations, you are going to have an absolutely

59:06.460 --> 59:11.840
awful time on certain hardware configurations and there's, you know, he says, oh, this always

59:11.840 --> 59:12.840
has this problem.

59:12.840 --> 59:16.480
Well, Windows, I could argue Windows 8 always has a problem with going and dealing with

59:16.480 --> 59:20.320
Wi-Fi drivers because at the start it had an awful time with most Wi-Fi drivers that

59:20.320 --> 59:21.320
I found.

59:21.320 --> 59:22.320
Yeah.

59:22.320 --> 59:25.640
It's like, um, my, uh, brightness controls actually don't work on Windows 8.

59:25.640 --> 59:26.640
Yeah.

59:26.640 --> 59:27.640
Just say that.

59:27.640 --> 59:31.760
The other thing is that Linux tends to improve and then improve beyond Windows.

59:31.760 --> 59:37.560
Like I recall the days when Wi-Fi was a problem on Linux and it wasn't on Windows and like

59:37.560 --> 59:42.280
I just described earlier, it's now gotten to the point where Linux is better with Wi-Fi

59:42.280 --> 59:43.280
than Windows.

59:43.280 --> 59:44.280
Printers were another thing.

59:44.280 --> 59:45.280
Terrible with printers.

59:45.280 --> 59:46.280
Now it's better.

59:46.280 --> 59:49.400
Do you think maybe that's because there's no big, big releases?

59:49.400 --> 59:54.160
Like there's big a window up there, boom, Windows 8, boom, Windows 8.1, boom, Windows

59:54.160 --> 59:55.160
9.

59:55.160 --> 59:58.040
And so the public consciously says, okay, this is one better.

59:58.040 --> 59:59.160
They've now improved stuff.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:04.280
Whereas Linux, there's no like splash major marketing push, new features in Linux, new

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.280
hardware support.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.280
It's awesome.

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:07.280
It's just this continual improvement that people don't rock.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:14.960
I think the biggest advantage Linux has is the kernel is its own team or system D is

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.840
its own team or Wayland and Xorg are their own teams.

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.520
They can work on improving their stuff.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:24.520
They can still communicate with each other and get those updates, but they can still

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:29.800
work individually so they can still help standardize things.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:30.880
It's too broad.

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:35.200
There's too much general knowledge being spread out among all the different professions.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:39.720
For us in Linux, we have very special masters of their domain.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.480
And they evolve at different rates, right?

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:45.680
And so it doesn't look like holistic improvement where individual components are improving

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.760
at different time rates.

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.800
And so it really takes a multi-year perspective to see the whole picture of improvement.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:56.240
And everything gets better all as their own little team and very specific and specialized

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.240
ways.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:00.840
The special release thing is covered by distros.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.960
They release parties, you get those.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.840
And I think like Fedora, let's take Fedora, for example.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:13.960
Fedora has upon their release, whenever they did their freeze, that snapshot of the kernel,

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:21.080
that snapshot of, let's say, Xorg and Wayland and SystemD and all that stuff, or Gnome KDE.

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.080
Awesome.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:29.560
Look how far the kernel has gone in not a very long time, like a year and a half.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:34.280
We have different systems actually trying to compete to win, unlike the Windows world,

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:38.680
which has one team which will only have that team dedicated to it and does not have any

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:39.680
competition.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:40.680
Right.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.600
And if there's no general market advantage to improving the feature that's under the

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.720
hood, doesn't make a bullet point on the box, there's really not a lot of political backing

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.520
in the company to make it better.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.080
It's like the Bowser wars.

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:54.840
There's competition, so they all get better collectively, thus all our subsystems get

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:55.840
better collectively.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:00.040
Yeah, everybody loves to give the Mac a handjob and talk about how great it is, but their

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:04.360
file system is literally a disgrace.

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:09.040
HFS Plus is the most disgraceful file system that is still shipping on a major operating

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:14.920
system, but Apple can't make a sexy bullet point on a keynote presentation about improving

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:20.520
the file system, so they continue to add new features like bounce scrolling and full screen

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:25.640
operations and individual spaces or whatever, but they don't fix their absolute train wreck

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.640
of a file system.

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.800
But they don't have to because they know marketing.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:29.800
That's where Linux fails.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:30.800
Right, but I'm glad...

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.840
Linux is adorable and grassroots, kind of.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:37.200
They did market ZFS as their time capsule though once, because time capsule is ZFS,

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.200
doesn't it?

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.960
No, it's all HFS Plus.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.520
I believe even the iOS file system is HFS Plus.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.520
I think it is, yeah.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:46.960
And I agree that it's not a sexy feature that they can sell, and that's why I'm thankful

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.240
that the Linux system works.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:53.400
We continue to get things like file systems worked on, even when it's not a sexy feature.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:54.400
Thank goodness.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:59.080
Yeah, things like people like Linus can focus on the core, and people like Aaron Saigo and

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.320
Mark Shuttleworth can focus on the pretty stuff.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:05.160
Also, look how far the kernel itself has gone.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:10.080
Even just like a year and a half ago, like when 3.0 was out and everything, of how bad

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:13.440
power management was and overheating, and everybody was complaining about that.

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:18.760
Two, three, four months, they fixed that, and now it's focused on graphics.

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:22.640
Look how far Intel graphics has come, and now they're working on Radeon graphics.

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:27.080
It's just getting better so fast, it's actually kind of blowing my mind a little bit.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:28.080
I know, yeah.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.240
It is really awesome.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:33.360
This post on Reddit, I don't know if you remember, Chris, remember there was a blog

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:38.360
post a couple of years back where the guy, he reviewed Linux as a server operating system,

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:43.120
and remember he said it was terrible because he tried to install apps on Fedora or something

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.120
like that.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.400
That's what this post reminds me of.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:51.080
All this stuff that this guy's mentioning, it's completely wrong.

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:56.120
It's sort of like he's Googled a bunch of stuff, and then read complaints that people

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.360
have made, and then just made a post from it.

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.200
None of it actually seems like he's experienced it.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.920
He kind of talks a little bit in there like, well, I have to keep up to date, and I follow

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.360
all of this for my job, and I don't know, he doesn't say what his job is, and that's

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.600
kind of a vague explanation, but yeah.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.600
Intel's admin.

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:15.240
Yeah, or yeah, like I run it in some VMs, I mean it sounds like a really loose association

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:19.740
with, and he obviously has followed some of the issues, and the only thing is, is like

01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:23.260
all of these things, this guy just did a really good job, and I got this whole thing, we only

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:27.740
read like 40% of it, I got the whole thing linked in the show notes, this guy just did

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:32.200
a really good job, but basically taking all the biggest ones you hear, maybe one talking

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:36.360
point is put into a response, and this guy just kind of put them all together, and I

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:44.080
think as Steam OS starts to sort of lure people away from Windows a little bit, you're going

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:47.200
to have, I mean I think this is already starting to happen, you have people looking into it,

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.120
you got people that are deploying, we just talked about people that are deploying, it

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:54.760
was Ubuntu at that high school because they didn't want to go to XP, it's going to happen

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.760
more and more.

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:59.600
And so I think this is just something maybe we'll just keep an eye on, because I grabbed

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:03.160
this article here that I think I found in this, somebody linked in our subreddit, where

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:10.000
it said you can blame Linux FUD for Microsoft's dominance in schools, and in fact there was

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.360
this parent who went in to talk to the staff and said look, your class requirements say

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:20.000
that I have to have Microsoft Office at home for my student to go and enroll in this class,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.520
and he said let me tell you about LibreOffice, and she starts writing stuff down, and then

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:28.280
when she realized he was talking about replacing Microsoft, she stops him and she says, you

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:33.080
know it might even be illegal for us to remove Microsoft Office or Windows from previously

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:37.320
purchased computers due to the vendor agreement that the school district has signed with Microsoft.

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:41.600
And I know I've told this story a lot, but it bears repeating, and I'll go into some

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:45.240
detail, I don't think I've ever gotten into as much detail as I will today, is I worked

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:50.280
for the school district of Arlington when I was a high school student, and I remember

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:55.920
being in their IT department, and we had this, we were deploying wireless links between the

01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:00.920
schools because we were paying tons and tons of money to have T1 direct connections between

01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:04.840
each school, and Arlington's actually one of the larger school districts in our state,

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:09.720
and so this was costing the school district tens and tens of thousands of dollars, and

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:13.720
back then T1s were just outrageously expensive.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.560
They were the fastest connection you could get, and you paid for it.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:22.520
And so they decided, well, let's do this one-time investment, they even took out a big loan

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:28.760
to pay for it, let's get these wireless point-to-point links, there's this new protocol called 802.11b,

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:32.920
and it'll do two megabits, and we'll link all of these schools up over this two megabit

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:33.920
link.

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:40.240
Now you got a bunch of school district employees who are, in this case, his full-time job was

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:45.480
actually a teacher, he wasn't necessarily a network engineer, and this is TCPIP's even

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:50.640
still kind of new-ish, you know, NetBooey, IPX, and AppleTalk were still the dominant

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:55.080
protocols on the network, so IP segmentation wasn't really something people knew really

01:06:55.080 --> 01:07:01.280
to think about, and so they accidentally deployed across the entire school district one flat

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:08.480
255.255.00 LAN, just this one massive LAN, and it was all interlinked by these two megabit

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.600
wireless connections that were spotty to begin with.

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:17.480
And of course, the router, so if you had a printer that was on a different IP network,

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:21.700
the router was back at the school district head office, and so to send a print job, every

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:25.840
time a student printed, so you can imagine at the end of class when the three computer

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:29.880
labs were all printing out their results, all of this printer traffic would go down

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:33.980
over the wireless network to the router and then send it back up the wireless network

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:38.060
to the printer that was sitting right next to us all, and it absolutely just destroyed

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:41.180
the entire network and it made the computer systems unusable.

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:45.600
So we knew immediately that we needed to change this up and put routers in front of each wireless

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:49.280
access point and create a local network where everything could talk on its own local LAN,

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.840
wouldn't have to go down to the school district office.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.960
I was pretty proud of myself for figuring this out as a high school student.

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:58.280
We got it all styled in and we said, okay, well, NT is this thing, NT5, wasn't called

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:02.560
Windows 2000, NT5 is this thing that's in active development, and they have this proxy

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.560
server on there.

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:06.480
No, no, we're not going to use beta software.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.460
Okay, fair enough, fair enough, well there is a way to do it on NT4, it's called Microsoft

01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:14.320
Proxy Server 2.0 or something like that, and it will do some routing and it will do some

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:17.600
caching because we also wanted web caching, and then eventually be able to, it's a school,

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.320
we wanted to be able to apply filters.

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:23.400
So we put this NT4 box into production on a pretty decent machine and it immediately

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:24.820
could not handle the traffic.

01:08:24.820 --> 01:08:27.140
It was absolutely just not even an option.

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:30.600
And again, we didn't necessarily want to go with beta software, so somebody in one of

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:34.840
the computer classes says, well, what about this Red Hat?

01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:35.840
What about this?

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.040
And we looked at it, oh, that's interesting, but you know, we didn't have the CDs.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:41.480
Well, okay, well we could download this Debian and write it to these floppy disks, and it's

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:45.760
like this whole series of floppy disks, and so we download this Debian thing and we install

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:49.120
it on the same computer that we had NT4 on previously.

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:52.600
We put it in there, we find this thing called Squid, we install Squid, right, this is all

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.000
just brand new to us.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.360
We set up a basic routing table because thankfully one of the teachers there had experience on

01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.840
a BSD in the past and knew kind of how to do some of this stuff.

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:06.320
And we put that box in and it was a night and day situation.

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:10.000
Like the network came back, performance was back, printing happened instantly.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
It was amazing.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.560
And we all just kind of sat back and went, wow, and that's free?

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.560
We just did that for free?

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:20.640
Well then pretty soon, because we were in a pilot program with Microsoft, one of the

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:24.240
parents who was working at Microsoft found out what we had done because the kid went

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:28.120
home from the computer class and told his dad, well, dad worked at Microsoft and dad

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:32.160
wasn't very happy about that because the school district had an agreement with Microsoft.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:36.600
The deal was the school district got free Microsoft training books, Microsoft Office

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:42.280
and Windows licenses, and the students even got vouchers to turn in to get Microsoft certified

01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:43.280
engineer certificates.

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:47.840
So it was like this really sweetheart deal and they were piloting this program at the

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.540
school district because the parent was the one leading it and he used to be a former

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:53.360
student at the school.

01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:56.160
And so when they came in, they said, here's the deal.

01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:00.240
If you don't pull that Linux box out and put a Windows NT5 box in its place, we'll pull

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:02.160
our entire program.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:08.000
And this is, I mean, to say it's a value of maybe $200,000 might be a low ball because

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.100
it's all of the licenses for all of the Windows boxes in the school district, thousands and

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:15.880
thousands of computers, all of the Office licenses, the voucher program for students

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:20.120
to get certified as a Microsoft certified engineer for free, we're going to pull all

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.680
of that and you will owe us for these machines.

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:26.660
You will have to cut us a check next year for all of these licenses if you keep this

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.520
one Linux box as your router.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:32.440
This is one Linux box at one school that we had up for a couple of days.

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:36.440
Like we put it in on a Friday and this is the conversation we're having on a Tuesday.

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:38.360
It was like that fast that it happened.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:46.400
And I was so impressed to see my teacher and the technology director of the school district,

01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:50.880
you know, they met with the guy, they thought about it for about a week, which I totally

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:54.920
understand and at the end of that week they said, we're not going to do it.

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.900
We're not going to pull this Linux box out.

01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:58.440
You can take your funding.

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:02.840
And I was, and you know what, the school district like had a major problem.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.460
They had some levy funds that they were using to replace equipment.

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:10.500
They had to take those levy funds and essentially reappropriate them somehow to buy licenses.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.040
I mean, it was this massive thing.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:14.900
And eventually the computer programs died off because of it because they just could

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:16.220
not fund them anymore.

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:19.780
And now they have like one computer program when they used to have three full time computer

01:11:19.780 --> 01:11:23.840
labs with three like all day long computer classes going.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:28.800
And so I watched sort of how this first, it was the first approach, the first wave was

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:32.460
like, well look, Linux isn't going to run for a long time and you know, we're really

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:33.760
working on some great stuff.

01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.200
You're going to want to have some filtering at first.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:39.380
It was their first pass when they first found out about it was an email that was sort of,

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:41.640
well here's all the reasons why Linux isn't going to work for you guys.

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:42.820
You don't want to use this.

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:48.480
And when we rejected those, they immediately escalated to, we're going to pull everything.

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.640
That's unbelievable.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.640
Not surprising.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:55.000
I've, I've heard similar stories, not, not to that severity, but I've heard that that's

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.840
back in those days, especially they could get away with stuff like that.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:02.560
They knew that in order to maintain their top of the mountain that they, and then indoctrination

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.560
early was important.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.560
This might've been even before.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.560
I don't get how that does not violate antitrust.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.840
Well, I was just going to say this might've been even before the whole antitrust thing

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:11.840
happened.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:12.840
It probably was.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.200
Because Internet Explorer was brand, brand new.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.640
It was like version four.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:19.920
It was like, Internet Explorer was not bundled with the operating system at this time.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.760
That antitrust laws are adorable if anyone thinks they're really adhered to.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:26.600
I mean, it's all about who, which lobbyists, you know, worked with whomever.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.600
In the US it's, it's, it's crap.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.200
This Linux FUD goes all the way back to then because that was their first pass.

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:38.360
That was pass number one was we'll, we'll throw some bull crap at you about this, this

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:43.080
like they, they, they even, they even took issue with the proxy software we use.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.160
It's called Squid.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.160
Are you kidding me?

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.160
Right?

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.160
Like, like everything.

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.160
They tried everything.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:53.000
Well, in fairness, Squid is the universal symbol for evil, evil people, you know, the,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
the, you know, like supervillains, they always have a Squid thing going on.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
That's true.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Good point.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Yeah, that is true.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
And maybe they are.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.840
Maybe it's, maybe the Squid project is just taking the, the long burn approach to their

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:03.840
evil plans.

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:07.840
Anyways, I got a link in the show notes that talks about blaming, blame the Linux FUD for

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.040
Microsoft dominance in schools.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.120
If you guys want to read more about that now, we'd like to have you join us live.

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.400
We got this virtual lug here in our mumble room.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.400
You can hang out.

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.480
We have these shows on Tuesdays at 2pm Pacific.

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:24.120
You can get that in your local time over at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.500
We also want your feedback.

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:29.640
You can email us, go over to Jupiter broadcasting.com and pop the contact link and choose Linux

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.120
unplugged from that dropdown.

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.120
Do that.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.720
Sometimes you set you guys, sometimes you choose general comments.

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:40.160
I don't read those too often, but I read the Linux unplugged ones every Tuesday.

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:41.160
So there you go.

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.160
All right, Matt.

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:45.480
Well, we got a how to coming up on this week's episode of the Linux action show.

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:46.480
Nice.

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:49.560
We got some security stuff in the works too, we'll be talking about very soon.

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.040
And then we also have that little guy distro review we'll be doing.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.800
So we got a lot of stuff coming up.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:54.800
Good stuff.

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.800
All right, everybody.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.360
Well, thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux unplugged.

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.440
Go over to iTunes and rate and comment if you haven't yet.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.440
That helps discovery.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:17.080
And we hope to see you right back here next week.
