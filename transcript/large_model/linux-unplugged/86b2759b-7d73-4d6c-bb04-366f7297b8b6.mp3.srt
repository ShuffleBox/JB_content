1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Add this to the list of reasons to never run Windows.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,200
Office Depot's name's getting dragged through the dirt

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,040
this week when it was revealed that they will be paying out

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,000
$35 million in refunds for tricking people

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,760
with bogus malware scans.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,600
Yeah, I don't know.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,120
This is just, it's been so long since I've bought computers

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,000
this way, it felt so foreign.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But you gotta feel bad for people who just want to get

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,180
a new machine and end up as part of this scam.

11
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,360
Windows users would come in.

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,760
They'd say, take a look at my computer, it's running slow.

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,120
That's because it runs Windows.

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,360
I mean, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,840
I know a lot of people, I'm just having fun.

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,120
And so then they would bring it in and Office Depot

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,560
would scan it and they had the software rigged

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,440
to show false detections, false threats.

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,300
And then they'd be like, all right, $300 to fix that.

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,100
I mean, how could you not, right?

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,380
You don't know, you're bringing your stuff to Office Depot

22
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,440
so you obviously have no idea how computers work.

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,360
I know, it's such a shame though because like,

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,400
you could grab a great SSD for that price

25
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,520
and that would make the machine way faster

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,560
without a doubt, right?

27
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,400
Of course.

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,840
Also, maybe put Linux on there.

29
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,840
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 295 for April 2nd, 2019.

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:28,480
Oh, hey y'all, welcome in to your weekly Linux talk show,

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,440
Linux Unplugged.

32
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,400
This week, it's a special episode.

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,840
We are packed.

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,800
My name is Chris.

35
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,720
My name is Wes.

36
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,080
Hello, Mr. Payne.

37
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,680
So aside from a full cast of characters this week,

38
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,920
we have a big batch of community news

39
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,280
that we'll be getting into.

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,600
Mozilla is doing quite a few useful things.

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,280
We'll tell you about them this week.

42
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,240
NGINX wants to reassure you, everything's gonna be okay.

43
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,040
And Raspberry Pi has new accessories for you to buy

44
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,520
and they got me with one of them.

45
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,560
I'll tell you which new Raspberry Pi accessory

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,300
I picked up this week.

47
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,480
And we'll get into some big news for elementary OS

48
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,480
and the slick update the Ubuntu Mate project has

49
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,280
for Raspberry Pi users.

50
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,280
There's something really sweet in there.

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,200
I don't know, for me, it's like a game changer.

52
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,720
We'll talk about that in a little bit.

53
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,360
And then towards the end of the show,

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,020
assuming we have some time,

55
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,280
we have some deep, deep thought provoking feedback

56
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,320
to get into.

57
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,640
Well, at least some decent feedback.

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,560
I don't know if I'd say it's deep and thought provoking.

59
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,680
Stick around and find out.

60
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,240
Yeah, maybe that's the way to put it.

61
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,040
But as we're getting close to episode 300,

62
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,280
I feel like we've got some great stuff lined up,

63
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,360
including, like I mentioned earlier,

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
a great cast of characters.

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,840
In our Mumble Room joining us this week,

66
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,160
we've got Billy, Brandon, Brent,

67
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,320
Cassidy from elementary, Cubicle Mate, Foursquare,

68
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,480
Fundament Utils, Mini-Mech, NE1, Nero Burner,

69
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,400
Skull Leader, Social Happiness, awesome to see you, Emma,

70
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,360
Tech Mav, oh man, great to see you,

71
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,720
and of course, Mr. Wimpress.

72
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,920
Time appropriate, greetings, Mumble Room.

73
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,040
Hello, everybody.

74
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,200
Good evening, how's it going?

75
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,640
Wow.

76
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,920
I'm just looking at the waveform there.

77
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,000
This is incredible.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,840
That was great.

79
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,680
Hello, everybody.

80
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,800
It is really good to have you here today.

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,280
Our main duty for this episode this week

82
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,760
was to avoid putting April Fool's stories

83
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,200
in the news lineup.

84
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,480
That was job one.

85
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,560
And this is Tuesday.

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,160
April Fool's was yesterday.

87
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,520
We were really close, really close.

88
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,600
So I had to look and had to reject a lot of stories.

89
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,000
We all, we've got a team now.

90
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,840
We've got a team now, including folks

91
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,200
that are just dedicated to researching this stuff.

92
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,040
It's a team, it's pretty great.

93
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,560
And there was one story that, it's fake,

94
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,400
but it really made me chuckle.

95
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,240
Did you see this one?

96
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,080
I did.

97
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,920
You did see this one?

98
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,120
Hackaday had their April Fool's story.

99
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,120
GNU slash Linux distros drop support for Vi.

100
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,200
It's about time.

101
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,760
No more VI, the war is over.

102
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,200
They say the reasons for this move

103
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,840
aren't entirely clear to us,

104
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,680
but from what we can see on the GNU slash Linux mailing list,

105
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,400
the confusing modal interface

106
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,480
and the fact that it's been hard for novice users

107
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,600
was the only cause of the decision.

108
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,160
Well, you can speak to this, Chris.

109
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,760
I thought you would say that.

110
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,120
Actually, before I realized it was,

111
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,240
because I mean, I was reading a bunch of fake stuff

112
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,160
and real stuff, right?

113
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,320
There was still real news that day.

114
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,720
Yeah, which we'll get to.

115
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,840
I thought this might've just been

116
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,760
like deprecating VI compatibility mode or something.

117
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,320
I thought this was a real change.

118
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,360
So they definitely got me.

119
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,640
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

120
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,720
Yeah, and of course, the only thing

121
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,560
that would've made the story better

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,760
is if everything was switching over to Nano by default.

123
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,520
We were here earlier in the studio

124
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,160
working on a configuration file

125
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,360
and Wes was standing next to me and I had to make a point

126
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,600
of not only do I, when Wes is next to me,

127
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,400
not only do I edit Nano, but I use Nano dash W

128
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,920
because you gotta have the wide Nano.

129
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,840
You gotta go all in.

130
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,000
So that's what I did.

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You're a Nano expert.

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,840
All right, well, let's get into the real news this week.

133
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,280
There is actually some news.

134
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,680
Not all of it is fake.

135
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,920
So kicking off, we have an announcement for the Apache

136
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,080
Foundation.

137
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,240
They have hit their 20th anniversary.

138
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,520
So another big happy birthday this week

139
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,400
goes out to what they bill as the world's largest

140
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,080
open source foundation, which provides 20 billion worth

141
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,760
of software for public good at 100%, no cost by now.

142
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,160
Happy birthday, I guess.

143
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,040
Yeah, I mean, we should take some time and appreciate.

144
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,040
There's a lot of really good software under that

145
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,120
and supported by that foundation.

146
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,760
So big thank you to the Apache Foundation and happy birthday.

147
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,120
They were founded in 1999, which makes

148
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,440
me feel like an old man and makes me realize

149
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,440
that that was 20 years ago, which we will just

150
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,400
move right on from that and continue in.

151
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,920
Here's to many more of those years for both of you.

152
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,000
I hope I'm still here.

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I hope I am here talking about their 40th.

154
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,520
Wouldn't that be amazing?

155
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,240
I'll see you there.

156
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,400
And then let's play this clip.

157
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,040
Perfect.

158
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,840
All right, hello future Chris.

159
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,560
Now, let's move on to the Mozilla is useful category.

160
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,840
And I like this.

161
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,600
I like looking at the stuff Mozilla

162
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,480
is doing that is either advancing the web in a good way

163
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,520
or is maybe even a project outside of Firefox

164
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,200
and Thunderbird.

165
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Not really context, we talk a lot about Mozilla.

166
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,360
So first for Firefox users, this is a fascinating one

167
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,080
that I think we're all going to agree

168
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,240
is a very, very good feature they need to just adopt.

169
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,840
Don't even experiment, just go with it immediately.

170
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,600
And that is reducing notifications for permissions

171
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,320
to have notifications on your computer.

172
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,400
Websites, how do I put this because I'm butchering this.

173
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,760
Everyone wants to send you push notifications.

174
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,920
And they want to notify you about their intent

175
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,280
to send you those notifications.

176
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,720
They say, in the interest of protecting our users

177
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,480
and the web platform as a whole, we

178
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,120
plan to experiment with restricting

179
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,800
how and when websites can ask for notification permissions.

180
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,760
You can see a little bit of their motivation

181
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,080
as they write anecdotal evidence, AKA people

182
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,800
complaining, tells us that there is

183
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,920
an issue with notification permission prompts

184
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,240
among our user base.

185
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,920
As we browse the web, we regularly

186
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,120
encounter these prompts.

187
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,480
And more often than not, we become annoyed at them.

188
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,800
Or, and this was true, I remember distinctly

189
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,760
for some reason the first time I saw one of these

190
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,800
because they accidentally clicked allow.

191
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,160
And then suddenly I was getting notifications

192
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,040
showing up on my browser and everywhere that I was signed in.

193
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,960
They're just confusing.

194
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,540
And I don't think, especially people already familiar

195
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,880
with the way the web works, they're

196
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,600
sort of this weird, new, out of band system.

197
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,200
And you never know what they really want to use it for.

198
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,360
So you're asked to make a decision before you even

199
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,960
understand what the content is that you're

200
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,120
going to get delivered.

201
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,040
And then you combine it with the cookie notice policy

202
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,200
and the user data notice policy or the hey,

203
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,760
would you like to sign up for our mailing list policy

204
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,640
thing that comes up or the hey, don't use an ad blocker.

205
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,280
All these things that come up at once now when I load a website

206
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,880
are horrible.

207
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,080
Nothing like when I use the web when it was originally started.

208
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:08,840
These are awful.

209
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,800
But it's more interactive, Chris.

210
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,320
Yeah.

211
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,760
I've got to have me and my notifications.

212
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
That's for sure.

213
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,480
They do have some interesting data here.

214
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,520
So it's not all just anecdotes from people

215
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,600
running the Firefox beta from December 21 from 2018

216
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,760
to January 24, so about a month of data.

217
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,600
There was 18 million prompts shown.

218
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,480
And these are just people on the beta.

219
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,280
And not even 3% were accepted.

220
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,480
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

221
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,920
Not even 3%?

222
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,640
Ouch.

223
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,760
Not even 3%?

224
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,600
I know, right?

225
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,360
That's devastating.

226
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,920
18 million prompts and not even 3% of them were accepted.

227
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,520
It's devastating.

228
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,640
That doesn't work.

229
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,160
Wow.

230
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,840
Well, I mean, there's always architects

231
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,120
in the chat room suggestion.

232
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,880
Break it all, just turn off JavaScript.

233
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,160
And that's one way.

234
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,120
Yeah, there you go.

235
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,920
That'll solve the problem.

236
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,460
Just actually, you know what else you could do?

237
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,840
You could switch everything to AMP.

238
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,120
That'll solve the problem too.

239
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,880
Problem solved with AMP, everybody.

240
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,920
Now, here's something else that Mozilla's doing

241
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,240
that maybe one day could surplant,

242
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,640
although it's probably not likely,

243
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,280
but could become at least a competitive alternative

244
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,400
to Electron if I'm not misreading this.

245
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,880
And Mozilla's bringing up the point

246
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,320
that with WebAssembly now becoming a thing

247
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,240
and all major browsers supporting it,

248
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,800
more and more folks are trying to develop applications

249
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,560
beyond the browser.

250
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,160
They say doing that provides a fast, scalable, and secure way

251
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,600
to run the same code across all your machines.

252
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,640
But we have yet to have a solid foundation

253
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,840
in which to build upon.

254
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,680
Code outside of a browser needs a way

255
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,280
to talk to the system, a system interface.

256
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,160
And the WebAssembly platform doesn't have that yet.

257
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,920
Now, Mozilla has been working on a runtime for the desktop

258
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,520
that allows you to run WebAssembly applications

259
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,720
as a desktop application.

260
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,080
But you needed, I guess, a standard to pull this off.

261
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,920
And that seems to be what they're coming out

262
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,040
with is this WASI standard.

263
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,000
Am I getting that right, Wes, W-A-S-I?

264
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
There you go, W-A-S-I.

265
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,040
Not wasabi, but WASI.

266
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,280
That might taste better.

267
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,760
Yeah, that might.

268
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,600
What are they trying to accomplish here?

269
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,400
They're exploiting the fact that we've made WebAssembly,

270
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,880
and it doesn't run on real hardware, right?

271
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,200
We just described this abstract machine

272
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,400
that we had already worked out how to run

273
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,960
and are actively working out how to run fast in our browsers.

274
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,840
So this is just all the little extra details

275
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,280
you need when you want to think, OK, well,

276
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,880
this could probably run a lot of other places, too.

277
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,400
Yeah, much like we do with Electron,

278
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
only using the Chrome runtime, essentially.

279
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,840
Or it's the reverse of Java applets and Java and network.

280
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,360
Yeah.

281
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,880
Yeah, it's nice to see Mozilla doing these kinds of things.

282
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah, let's figure out a way to do this.

283
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,800
They have been actively involved in all kinds

284
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,000
of great WebAssembly stuff.

285
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,720
And actually, they've got some of the best documentation.

286
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,080
If you're getting started with WebAssembly,

287
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,720
you want to learn about some of the concepts.

288
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,240
Yeah.

289
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,560
We did also recently see Lucet, which

290
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,760
is the Fastly Corporation's WebAssembly runtime.

291
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,800
And there's a couple other open source projects.

292
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,640
So there's clearly a lot of stuff going on.

293
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,400
It's nice to have a standard now early in the process

294
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,800
so we don't end up with a whole bunch of divergent runtimes.

295
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,240
WebAssembly is coming.

296
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,160
And it's going to come to your desktop, too.

297
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,640
And maybe that'd be good.

298
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,080
Maybe it'll make a good competitor to Electron

299
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,800
and keep both of them very, I guess,

300
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,640
actively engaged in pushing the boundaries.

301
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,880
I mean, yeah, one thing's for sure.

302
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,680
It's rare that we see things fade away.

303
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,560
We just have more things on our systems.

304
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,040
Yeah.

305
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,480
Yeah, things don't really go away anymore.

306
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
No.

307
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
Yeah.

308
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,520
They're too big to fail after a certain point.

309
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,640
Now, there's one last thing that Mozilla along with,

310
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,960
I think, the folks behind Vorbis are working on.

311
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,280
It's a Mozilla employee who was involved

312
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,960
with the Speaks codec and also Opus.

313
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,480
So this guy really knows his stuff.

314
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,560
Those are some credentials.

315
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,360
And they're working on LPCnet.

316
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,920
This is a codec in which they can transmit audio

317
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,920
in as little as 1.6 kilobytes.

318
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,840
Wow.

319
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,720
They're doing this with essentially a synthesis.

320
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,880
So instead of actually capturing the entire audio waveform,

321
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,400
it's almost like taking audio.

322
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,280
This is a super rough layman translation.

323
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,640
But it's almost like taking it and making it an SVG.

324
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,520
Yeah, you're trying to capture just enough detail

325
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,920
to recreate it, not perfectly, but be

326
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,280
able to describe it in a way that's good enough.

327
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,120
We have Mr. Bacon here, Mr. Cheese Bacon,

328
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,000
now part of our team.

329
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,880
Cheese, I'm going to butcher this.

330
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,160
So I want you to kind of help explain this to me.

331
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,640
But an SVG, it's a vector graphic which is scalable.

332
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,960
And so it's like the math for the image.

333
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,840
And then it renders the final image.

334
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,400
And you can rescale it to any size you want.

335
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,120
You can transmit a tiny SVG, but you

336
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,400
could have a huge image that you produce from it, correct?

337
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:56,880
Correct.

338
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,720
So I mean, it's a vector image.

339
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,600
And it stands for scalable vector graphic.

340
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,280
And it'll allow you to support transparencies with it.

341
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,560
Once you've created the SVG, you can open it up in a text editor

342
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,280
and edit it.

343
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,480
You can actually add like early animation type work to it.

344
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,760
SVGs are really cool.

345
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,680
And you can reduce their size.

346
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,640
And since they're vector graphics, of course,

347
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,000
they can be scaled infinitely.

348
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,080
So if you needed to use that same SVG on a billboard

349
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,320
or the side of an 18-wheeler or wherever

350
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,520
you needed to use that image, you

351
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,400
could scale it without losing resolution

352
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,400
or having an issue where it looked

353
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,800
aliased or something pixelated or something like that.

354
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,560
Exactly.

355
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,720
Now, I admit my analogy is weak here.

356
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,880
But now imagine taking that same concept

357
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,760
and applying it to audio, where you take the data

358
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,080
and you vectorize it.

359
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,880
And then you can re-synthesize it later on.

360
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,720
And you can improve the recreation process

361
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,320
down the road.

362
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,160
You can have better and better models and better and better

363
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,480
ways to do speech.

364
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,600
They're getting there now.

365
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,100
They're getting there to the sense

366
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,240
that you almost can recreate speech using,

367
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,160
guess what, machine learning, to have something

368
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,200
that sounds very accurate.

369
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,880
So I'm going to play you a demo here.

370
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,280
Here is the old technology using a great codec.

371
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,820
So it's still really good compression.

372
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,520
But it's old synthesis.

373
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,680
The birch canoe slid on the smooth plex,

374
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,480
glue the sheet to the dark blue background.

375
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,920
Now, it sounds like a speak and spell a little bit.

376
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,520
But the one thing you have to give it

377
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,080
is it's like two kilobits of audio a second.

378
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,840
It sounds like a really bad phone call.

379
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,800
But it is kind of understandable.

380
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,040
And you could use that to get speech

381
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,920
in the worst case connections, which is really impressive.

382
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,760
Because that brings in all kinds of packet radio possibly.

383
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,800
I don't know, all kinds of solutions.

384
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,480
Here is what this LPCNet project that's

385
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,480
getting contributed by Mozilla employee that

386
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,480
is bringing this further using the machine learning I just

387
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,080
talked about.

388
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,160
This is their more current sample now.

389
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,160
Add the sum to the product of these three.

390
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,080
Thieves who rob friends deserve jail.

391
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,640
Now, I don't know what that is about.

392
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,920
But that's just 1.6 kilobits of data.

393
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
Wow, that's pretty tiny.

394
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,880
And it sounds really, I mean, it's not bad.

395
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,200
It's totally understandable.

396
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,720
Like, I'm going to play just a second.

397
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,360
Add the sum to the product of these three.

398
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,880
That is much better than.

399
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,760
The birch canoe slid on the smooth plex.

400
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,800
Right, that's a much better.

401
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,080
And you could see where later on the decoder and the thing

402
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,120
that reconstitutes the speech could get much, much better

403
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,280
to the point where it could sound like a podcaster.

404
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,720
Oh, yes.

405
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,920
Honestly, those are pretty good.

406
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,560
Right now, and it's kind of interesting,

407
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,360
they've done a great job of explaining it.

408
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
All the stuff that most people are familiar with

409
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,400
are called waveform coders.

410
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,800
And then this is a vocoder.

411
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,320
Yeah.

412
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,360
And waveform coders are stuff like Opus

413
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,960
and all the stuff you might use for music.

414
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,000
Everything we're familiar, right?

415
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,720
And they basically try to take the natural waveform that

416
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,680
is sound and transcribe that as closely as possible

417
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,240
and capture all of that detail.

418
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,680
Now, maybe with MP3, you start throwing some of that away.

419
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,440
But essentially, you're recreating the waveform, right?

420
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,400
Vocoders, on the other hand, as you said,

421
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,200
they're really synthesizers.

422
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,960
They try to, like, in this mode, you have the encoder.

423
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,760
And it tries to grab a bunch of high-level stuff,

424
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,280
like pitch, shape of the vocal tract.

425
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,400
You have this model that you fill parameters for.

426
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,560
So instead of trying to actually track the waveform,

427
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,000
it's more like describing, you could

428
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,720
think of a really high-level version

429
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,760
would be a transcript and then feeding a transcript back.

430
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,160
Yeah.

431
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,360
Right?

432
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,560
But this is a little lower level because it's

433
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,440
trying to recreate it at a more accurate level with tone

434
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,760
and character of voice.

435
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,480
That's basically what they're doing here.

436
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,160
And I think that demo really shows how you can hear it.

437
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,400
The difference is now that machine learning

438
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,400
has built some high-quality synthesis algorithms,

439
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,560
they can apply that here.

440
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,160
Before, all this still worked.

441
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,840
Vocoders had been around since the 70s.

442
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,360
Right.

443
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,240
They just sucked.

444
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,800
Yeah, they sure did.

445
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,160
They were speak and spell.

446
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,080
And now they're getting kind of legitimate.

447
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,440
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

448
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,040
So the folks over at NGINX are protesting a little bit

449
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,320
too much.

450
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,960
But they're getting a lot of heat.

451
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,640
We had a pretty mild reaction to the NGINX purchase.

452
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,960
Yeah, I thought so.

453
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,280
You know, I didn't get Wimpy's hot take on it.

454
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,960
I don't know, Wimpy, did you have any hot take reactions?

455
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,600
First thoughts?

456
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,120
What are other really zippy terms people

457
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,160
use for immediate reactions?

458
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,240
What are your first reactions to NGINX

459
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,120
getting purchased by F5?

460
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,640
Huge controversy, Wimpy?

461
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,360
No, I think it speaks to the success of NGINX

462
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,200
and how it dominates that space now.

463
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,600
So I think congratulations to NGINX for all of the hard work

464
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,320
that a lot of the people there have put in.

465
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,680
And I hope they're going to benefit from that acquisition.

466
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,880
I'm sure some of them will be getting some kickbacks.

467
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,080
And I think it will cement NGINX's position

468
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,200
in the market as the sort of Swiss army knife of proxying,

469
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,520
reverse proxying, and fast serving of assets.

470
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,920
Right, well said.

471
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,800
Unfortunately, apparently you are a completely unreasonable

472
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,840
shill, according to the open source community,

473
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,680
because they are upset.

474
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:25,920
But NGINX have had the open source

475
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,540
and pro version of NGINX for years already.

476
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:34,920
So that open core model is being established for some time,

477
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,680
just because it's changed ownership.

478
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,400
I mean, what does that change?

479
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,000
Nothing.

480
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,300
I don't think anyone was really thinking

481
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,760
about the company behind it before.

482
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,240
And suddenly, suddenly we are.

483
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,840
It's the license, stupid.

484
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,240
I mean, that really should be the tagline there.

485
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,880
But NGINX writes on their blog, we've heard it loud and clear.

486
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,320
We need to continue to demonstrate our commitment

487
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,140
to open source.

488
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,880
They go on to say, let me take a moment to be very explicit.

489
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,040
F5 is committed to not only supporting

490
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,360
the development of NGINX, the open source edition,

491
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,200
as well as other NGINX open source projects,

492
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,680
but also increasing our investment over time.

493
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,520
Just to repeat that, F5 is committed

494
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,120
to NGINX's open source technologies, developers,

495
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
and community.

496
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,040
I swear.

497
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,580
OK, I might have added that last part.

498
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,500
But they're really hitting this hard.

499
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,000
They are.

500
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,880
And to make an interesting point here,

501
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,840
we're also seeing increased acceptance

502
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,640
of mainstream companies as stewards

503
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,400
of open source technologies.

504
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,280
Microsoft bought GitHub, VMware bought Heptio,

505
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,960
and IBM bought Red Hat.

506
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,120
The assumption that big fish eats little fish

507
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,960
means big fish kills open source project is outdated thinking.

508
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,760
Going back to your point, Wimpy, that's

509
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,160
the result of success to a degree.

510
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,240
As they become more successful, large market players

511
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,260
scoop them up.

512
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:54,440
And also, before the acquisition, the pro version of NGINX

513
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,840
provided the funding that organization needed,

514
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,240
such that the open core version of NGINX

515
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,680
was available as open source to all of us,

516
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,600
so that your website and my website and millions of others

517
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,920
are able to run with a well-supported, cutting edge

518
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,520
web server and provide all sorts of nifty stuff

519
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,080
like object caching.

520
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,960
And if you are at web scale, you're

521
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,920
obviously going to be making some money.

522
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,240
And those pro features you can buy into

523
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,040
are probably of importance to you

524
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,160
and not so important to the likes of you and I.

525
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,320
So I'm quite happy for these organizations

526
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,360
to be producing open source software

527
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,840
and have a markup on an enterprise version that

528
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,240
means that they can continue to fund the open source stuff.

529
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,820
Yeah.

530
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,820
In fact, this live stream we're doing

531
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,320
as we record the show right now is

532
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,920
being powered by NGINX in multiple different ways.

533
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,480
It is a Swiss Army knife of tools.

534
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,960
And F5 is savvy for scooping it up.

535
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,680
It shows that they're watching the market

536
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,960
and they understand where there's overlap there.

537
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,200
So there are moments where it's a little uncomfortable.

538
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,040
I think that's particularly in open core.

539
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:15,440
I think it's hard because the test is how engaged are they

540
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,760
with the open source project?

541
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,940
Because if they're just making money off proprietary features

542
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,480
and not developing, then just dropping

543
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,440
like a GZIP or a ZIP file somewhere,

544
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,440
OK, there we've complied with the license has technically

545
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,560
been complied with.

546
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,360
So it can be hard, I think, especially as an outsider.

547
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,320
But I don't think that's ever been the NGINX community.

548
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,320
No, as NGINX were transitioning to their pro model,

549
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,960
it used to be the case that you had to compile your modules

550
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,540
into the NGINX binary at build time.

551
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,520
And they went to great lengths to make

552
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,240
that a modular architecture as they moved to the pro model

553
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,840
so that they could continue to develop

554
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,320
the core of NGINX independently of the modules that make up

555
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,640
the pro enterprise version.

556
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
So they've demonstrated in the past

557
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,760
that they're committed to maintaining the open source

558
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,880
roots of the project.

559
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,920
Yeah, I think really the solution here

560
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
is for NGINX to have said nothing.

561
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,120
Just look at the absolute outrage

562
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,880
over the GitHub purchase.

563
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,360
And they just, as everybody was doing their mass exodus

564
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,440
to GitLab, they just stayed cool.

565
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,720
They didn't say anything.

566
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,000
While GitLab was doing blog post after blog post

567
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,720
about how to migrate and tweeting like crazy,

568
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,320
they just sat there and didn't say anything.

569
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,080
And now nobody talks about it.

570
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,440
It's like, it's going to happen.

571
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,680
And by the time the deal is finalized,

572
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,100
it'll be like, oh, yeah, right, that, OK.

573
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,180
And the only thing that can really prove their point

574
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,560
is what's going to happen in the future

575
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,060
and their continued involvement.

576
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,120
Yeah, they say that here in the blog post.

577
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,360
And it really, that is, I think, your and my overall opinion

578
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,840
on these big acquisitions is sit back and see what happens.

579
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,520
Just watch what happens, and then make your judgment then.

580
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,120
And the great thing about open source

581
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,160
is it comes back to that license, stupid.

582
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,560
You've got that license.

583
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,560
So if you don't like what they're doing, you're good to go.

584
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,040
So let's talk to Mr. Cassidy, who joins us

585
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,080
from the elementary project, who just had one of those,

586
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,920
like, it had to be a calculated decision, Cassidy, I imagine.

587
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,800
Like, do we do an April Fools announcement or not?

588
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,120
Like, that must have been, right there, a hard call.

589
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,960
Yeah, we've done April Fools in the past, and they've been fun.

590
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,480
But this time we had some actual news,

591
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,800
and we thought, why not just release that on April 1st?

592
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,920
You know, have some fun.

593
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,840
So you guys are announcing that the App Center

594
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,040
will be using Flatpak.

595
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,120
And I think it makes sense, you know, local repository

596
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,000
that you curate yourself and all of that.

597
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,300
I guess my first thought is, why is this an announcement,

598
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,040
in a sense, and not to take away from it,

599
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
but why is this an announcement to begin with?

600
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,680
And walk me back from that.

601
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,560
Like, why does this matter?

602
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,920
How will this impact users and all of that?

603
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,320
Yeah, so I mean, ever since these newer packaging formats

604
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,840
started showing up with containerization

605
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,360
and sandboxing, people have been asking elementary,

606
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,200
you know, when are you going to jump on board?

607
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,080
When are you going to jump on this bandwagon?

608
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,820
And we've taken the approach of being, you know, kind of slower,

609
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,480
methodical, intentional about not just jumping

610
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,680
on a bandwagon.

611
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,120
And to your credit, I'd say I've seen the project attend events

612
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,640
from both communities, from the Flatpak and Snap community.

613
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,400
So you've been active in both communities completely.

614
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,020
Exactly, yeah.

615
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,560
We've been kind of surveying the technologies,

616
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,980
watching them really closely and engaging with people,

617
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,720
but not just jumping on a bandwagon.

618
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,080
So the difference now is that we've been, you know,

619
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,900
since about 2015, we've been working on these technologies

620
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,520
and talking to people.

621
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,480
And I think Flatpak is really in a place

622
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,240
now where it's getting more mature.

623
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,320
We understand it a lot better, and we're

624
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,600
starting to see those advantages.

625
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,560
We're also starting to grow with App Center

626
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,200
to a point where the advantages of a format like Flatpak

627
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,720
would benefit both us and our users.

628
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,180
So it really just is the right time

629
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,080
to jump onto one of these new formats.

630
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,260
And after a lot of back and forth and discussion

631
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,360
with both our first party developers and our third party

632
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,080
developers and the people who are making these formats

633
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,480
themselves, we decided that Flatpak was most closely

634
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,760
aligned to our needs.

635
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,440
So why not just do like a little quiet sneaky implementation

636
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,080
on the back end?

637
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,400
Why do the whole announcement about it?

638
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,840
I think we've started to actually do

639
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,760
the sneaky implementation on the back end in a few places.

640
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,740
There's a branch of App Center that supports Flatpak already.

641
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,120
And people are going to start seeing those things

642
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,960
and start talking.

643
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,720
So we might as well get out in front of it

644
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,600
and really be intentional about the message around it.

645
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,440
I was surprised because I wasn't sure how you felt as a project

646
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,080
that it seemed like some of the what would be otherwise

647
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,120
kind of like elementary OS exclusives

648
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,120
were getting Flatpacked up by the community

649
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,480
and spread around other distros.

650
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,120
And it's kind of like at one point,

651
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,480
that's great because it means more open source software.

652
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,040
Native applications on the desktop

653
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,680
are available to everybody.

654
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,800
But in another way, it's not as great

655
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,360
because these applications are designed

656
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,220
to be part of a larger environment.

657
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,600
And they kind of feel out of place on other desktops.

658
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,360
And I feel like it doesn't do a full service

659
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,720
to the complete elementary OS experience.

660
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,480
And not to mention, you get like these probably crazy bug

661
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,680
reports from somebody on Fedora Rawhide

662
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,720
that's trying to get somebody who's

663
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,720
making an elementary OS app to fix their problem.

664
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,720
So I thought maybe as a project, you guys were not

665
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,520
a big fan of that arrangement.

666
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,840
There's kind of three aspects of these newer containerized

667
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,480
formats like Flatpack.

668
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,840
There's the packaging itself, just like Debian packaging

669
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,040
or whatever.

670
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,980
There's the containerization or sandboxing.

671
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,960
And then there's the cross-platform aspect.

672
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,960
We're really adopting that first of three elements to start.

673
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,840
We're just adopting it as a packaging format to start.

674
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,920
And that means it should be really seamless.

675
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,640
Nobody should really notice any differences on elementary OS.

676
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,880
The sandboxing part is the reason we're adopting it.

677
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,600
It's the better security and privacy.

678
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,560
We've been doing a lot of work on that front.

679
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,760
And that's the kind of future we're moving towards,

680
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,560
that A, it'll make app reviews easier on the app center side.

681
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,000
And B, it also just makes users' devices more secure

682
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,880
and respecting their privacy more.

683
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,520
The third aspect, the cross-platform part,

684
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,040
isn't really a concern or a driving factor

685
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,320
at all for us with elementary.

686
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,120
It's neat.

687
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,760
It's cool.

688
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,440
It's a thing that exists there.

689
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,840
But the cross-platform part, while it's

690
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,500
very loudly one of the primary reasons for these formats

691
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,780
to exist, it's not actually one of the reasons

692
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,280
we're adopting it or one of the things we're really

693
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,360
investing time in.

694
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:42,880
Yeah.

695
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,760
Yeah, I understand.

696
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,640
I think there's probably some advantage, too,

697
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,200
that Flatpack is very closely tracking GNOME features

698
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,480
and GTK features, which elementary OS uses a lot of GTK.

699
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,120
So there's some advantages there, right,

700
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,440
when they make a change that affects the overall GTK

701
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,240
ecosystem that is overall maybe something very nice,

702
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,120
like a new way to access a device or something like that.

703
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,440
You, as a project, automatically get to take advantage of that.

704
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:10,960
Exactly.

705
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,280
Yeah, it's really closely aligned

706
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,520
with the stack of technologies we use.

707
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,440
As we work more and more with folks that work on GNOME,

708
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,960
we see projects like GTK actually

709
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,640
get better because there's multiple projects using GTK.

710
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,600
If GTK was only used by GNOME, it

711
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,560
might be a little bit restricted in how it can be used.

712
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,680
But because you have XFCE and elementary

713
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,840
and other desktops that are using GTK, it makes GTK better.

714
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,620
We feel the same about Flatpack.

715
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,360
It's not technically a GNOME project,

716
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,880
but a lot of people from GNOME are working on it.

717
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,960
And so by having yet another project

718
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,060
throw their weight behind it, it will

719
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,160
make the technology itself better as well.

720
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
So this is going to be something you guys work on probably

721
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,000
for a period of time because it sounds like it may not even

722
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,600
land as the default way to package software for Juno

723
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,160
itself.

724
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,960
So this could be something that takes a little while

725
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,640
to implement.

726
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,280
Right, yeah.

727
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,960
So today, nothing is changing as far

728
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,220
as how apps are being developed and distributed

729
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,120
on elementary OS.

730
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,840
It's still using the App Center dashboard

731
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,560
with the Debian formatting.

732
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,400
But we wanted to get this out there

733
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,560
to kind of let our developer community know what's coming

734
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,120
and start to get feedback from them

735
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,520
as we work through these issues.

736
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,520
So there's two main things we have to do.

737
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,360
We have to implement it in App Center itself, the client side

738
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,960
app, which work is progressing there really well.

739
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,360
And then we also have to implement it on the back end,

740
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,620
what we call App Center dashboard, where developers

741
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,720
actually submit their applications.

742
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,960
That work hasn't started yet, but we're

743
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,880
starting to look at that and kind of investigate

744
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,160
how we're going to do that.

745
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,880
So it's going to be a long process,

746
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,280
and it may not even come to Juno itself as an update.

747
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,720
We're still deciding how that migration will work.

748
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,080
But we wanted to get the news out there for our app developers

749
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,120
to know what's coming.

750
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,240
So I guess my last question would really be with this.

751
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,580
Is there anything in this that really inherently

752
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,580
prevents elementary OS from continuing to just use snaps

753
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,960
if the user wants to install a snap themselves?

754
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,640
No, of course not.

755
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,400
We're deciding to use Flatpak for the out-of-box experience

756
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,120
of App Center and elementary OS.

757
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,200
Developers or users are always free to do whatever

758
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,720
they want on their own systems.

759
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,400
They can install Snap, or they can install Debs,

760
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,280
or they can sideload whatever they can compile from tarballs.

761
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,720
So whatever the user wants to do, it'll still work.

762
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,320
This is just about the supported default experience

763
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,320
for Map Center.

764
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,840
Right, and in a sense, it's an implementation detail, isn't it?

765
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,040
It's really not a user-facing concern.

766
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,720
Exactly, yeah.

767
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,480
If we do our job correctly, then most users

768
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,640
shouldn't even really realize what's going on under the hood.

769
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,440
Yeah, and it makes total sense.

770
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,520
You want your own repo.

771
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,600
You want to curate it yourselves.

772
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,900
You've got your own App Center.

773
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,960
You want to publish applications for that.

774
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,080
It totally makes sense.

775
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,080
And it seems like you guys are thinking a lot about security,

776
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,320
too, which I really appreciate, especially

777
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,960
as this is the distro I recommend to friends and family.

778
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,160
It does seem like a particularly good match in that sense,

779
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,760
the same abstractions that are trying

780
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,880
to fight the same problems.

781
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,000
Yeah, yeah.

782
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,560
Exactly.

783
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,280
Well, thanks, Cassie.

784
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,680
Thanks for joining us and explaining it to us.

785
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,880
And we'll have a link to the entire Medium post, which

786
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,160
goes into a lot more details.

787
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,620
Was there anything else you wanted

788
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,400
to mention to make clear before we continue on, or is that?

789
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,000
Are we good?

790
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,520
I'm probably going to write up a follow-up post about this.

791
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,040
But we've been getting a lot of great feedback on social media,

792
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,640
people having concerns about, oh, I've

793
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,880
had issues with accessing external devices

794
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,800
with Flatpaks, or I've had issues with app sizes being

795
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,560
huge or downloading giant SDKs with Flatpaks.

796
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,920
And I do want to clarify that the way we're

797
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,000
implementing Flatpak will be a very, very specific

798
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,880
and considered implementation.

799
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,080
So to start, we're going to make sure that those permissions can

800
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,960
be very permissive, because we already review and curate

801
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,680
and test all apps that are submitted to App Center.

802
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,780
So we don't have to have the locked down permissions

803
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,200
to start that might break things like external devices.

804
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,720
So to start, there shouldn't be any big difference there

805
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,360
as far as issues that other people have seen

806
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,360
with other Flatpak implementations and things

807
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,560
like app sizes.

808
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,800
Similarly, we'll have a specific SDK

809
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,560
that developers must target when they submit to App Center.

810
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,440
So it's not like you'll download the entire GNOME

811
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,320
3.22 SDK for one app.

812
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,640
It'll use the SDK that's already installed on the system,

813
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,840
so it won't have a 2 gig download or whatever,

814
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,720
like people have seen with a lot of things on Flathub.

815
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,600
So Flatpak is just a technology.

816
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,280
It has lots of different implementations,

817
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,560
and we're being really careful with our implementation

818
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,960
to make sure that it solves these issues.

819
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,440
You're going to get it right, it sounds like.

820
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,840
That's a very good detail, because it's

821
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,520
a totally separate implementation.

822
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,640
So if you might have had a bad experience,

823
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,640
that's no reason to write off all the hard work

824
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,600
you guys are doing.

825
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,560
Yeah, all right.

826
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,280
Well, Cassidy, thank you very much.

827
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,400
Cassidy from the Elementary OS Project,

828
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,440
check out the link in the show notes.

829
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,600
It was good to have you with us.

830
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,040
Thank you, sir.

831
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,960
You're welcome to stick around for the show.

832
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,340
We'll just cover a couple more community news stories

833
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,440
before we get out of here.

834
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,880
First up, the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

835
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,460
They're actually not actually positive,

836
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,160
because there's two different branches.

837
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,120
So I don't know if this is the foundation or not,

838
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:17,480
but Raspberry Pi folk have an official keyboard and mouse

839
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,120
that is available for sale.

840
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,080
And one of the selling pitches of the keyboard,

841
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,640
besides its small size, is it's integrated with a USB hub.

842
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,000
I mean, you're going to need one of those anyway, right?

843
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,320
There's no way your laptop has anywhere enough ports.

844
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,680
Mine, I mean, actually, this one's pretty good.

845
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,920
Yeah, or Raspberry Pi.

846
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,840
Yeah, I mean, whatever device you're plugging into.

847
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,000
I was just immediately thinking that it looks so nice

848
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,640
that I would probably be using it not just on my Pis,

849
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,000
but on all my systems.

850
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,760
Yeah, you could.

851
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,560
It's just a cute little three-button scroll wheel

852
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:49,000
optical device with Raspberry Pi logos for the mouse.

853
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,600
It's a little USB cable, but it's white and red,

854
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,640
which is a cute little color scheme.

855
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,820
Yeah, it looks nice.

856
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,640
And then just like a pretty standard 78-key matrix

857
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,280
for the keyboard, which you probably would see on a laptop

858
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,160
keyboard.

859
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,920
What's interesting, though, is they've

860
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,720
worked on some custom firmware so that hopefully,

861
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,760
with a little magic, it can auto-detect

862
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,560
what country the keyboard is configured for

863
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,960
and just sort of work right.

864
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,840
So you'll be able to get a keyboard that's

865
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,360
manufactured in a simple, easy way that will work wherever

866
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,360
you are in the world.

867
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,000
Yeah, it's kind of worth reading the Raspberry Pi blog

868
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,120
post in the show notes, because they

869
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,600
talk about the care they went to to make it a good keyboard

870
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,360
experience.

871
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,160
And they're like, this turned out

872
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:33,000
to be a little more challenging than we expected, turns out.

873
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,680
The Raspberry Pi official keyboard and mouse

874
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,400
are available now from approved resellers.

875
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,920
And I decided to do it.

876
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,760
I got the keyboard.

877
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,960
The mouse wasn't available from the place I wanted to buy from.

878
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
So I got the keyboard.

879
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,120
I ordered it this morning.

880
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,560
I'm going to be curious to try it.

881
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,240
It wasn't bad.

882
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,200
It was like, I think it was like maybe after shipping and tax

883
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
and everything, it was like $27.

884
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,240
Yeah, that's not bad.

885
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,920
No.

886
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,600
And the mouse is something like around $20 US.

887
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,400
And maybe I'll pick it up later, but I

888
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,280
was thinking about doing a segment about a cheap Amazon

889
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,480
LCD HDMI screen and using this and just

890
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,200
like the cheap, easy, bare bones Raspberry Pi setup that

891
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,720
makes it easy to just bang out Raspberry Pi projects,

892
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,840
like a segment around that.

893
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,800
And so I thought, you know, I was actually,

894
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,720
literally when I was thinking about that segment,

895
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,400
I was like, I don't have a great keyboard.

896
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,200
And then, I'm not even joking, I woke up

897
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,360
and I saw this announcement.

898
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,560
So I thought, maybe it was a sign I should try this.

899
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,800
That or it's a good excuse to order a $20, $30 keyboard.

900
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,640
So I'll let you know what I think about it.

901
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
Also, something that I thought was kind of neat

902
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,480
is I think this might have been sent into the show too.

903
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,800
Make Pro Audio.

904
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,760
This is a DIY kit that you can get for the Raspberry Pi.

905
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,520
And you build modules around it, turn it

906
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,640
into a professional audio.

907
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,020
I'll just leave in the show notes.

908
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,040
We don't need to go into it a lot.

909
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,360
I think the thing that's really cool about it,

910
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,520
it's a company that's well known for make your own audio

911
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,020
gear.

912
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,560
The Make Pro Audio company, that's what they're known for.

913
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,440
And they have all kinds of modules

914
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,240
they've already built for other things.

915
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,560
So they're sort of known for creating these platforms

916
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,160
to build very professional audio kits around.

917
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,040
And they're doing a build your own audio gear

918
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,600
platform for the Raspberry Pi.

919
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,100
Right.

920
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,880
So you already have a huge access

921
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,720
to just a huge number of modules.

922
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,120
And now they have the code needed

923
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,960
to fit the Raspberry Pi into that existing platform.

924
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,600
Yeah.

925
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,560
And it snaps in there.

926
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,560
And then you've got a fancy Linux computer controlling

927
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,880
all that kind of stuff.

928
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,760
It's really cool.

929
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,520
It's really neat.

930
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,040
Well, go check it out.

931
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,160
For those of you who care, go check it out.

932
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,280
It'll be in the show notes.

933
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,520
I already want a little Raspberry Pi mixer

934
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,700
for my home studio closet.

935
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,440
I'm not going to lie.

936
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:41,920
Yeah.

937
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,920
I know, right?

938
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,400
I know.

939
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,140
You and I geek out on this kind of stuff.

940
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,320
Well, our last bit of community news for this week

941
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,280
is from our own Mr. Martin Wimperis in the mumble room

942
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,080
right now.

943
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,800
And it is Ubuntu Mate 1804 Beta 1.

944
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,880
So it's the LTS for Raspberry Pi.

945
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,600
It's a beta pre-release.

946
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
So it's hot off the presses right now.

947
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,140
It's a great opportunity to give Martin your feedback.

948
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,320
And Wimpy, you know what I'm most excited about

949
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,240
is that hardware-accelerated VLC.

950
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,880
That's huge.

951
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,780
You like that, do you?

952
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,280
I like that a lot.

953
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,720
I mean, I thought maybe you would get there.

954
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,880
But when we were kind of chatting off the show,

955
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,480
my expectations had been set for this maybe not

956
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,620
to happen in this release.

957
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,880
And then I see the announcement, and you nailed it.

958
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,640
So I'm curious how we went from, I

959
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,920
don't think it's going to happen, to, oh, by the way,

960
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,200
it's a feature now.

961
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,520
We were rather fortunate in, as I was entering the final stages

962
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,840
of preparing these images, the Raspberry Pi Foundation dropped

963
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:46,520
patches for current versions of VLC and some other software,

964
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,920
which made it possible for me to enable this.

965
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,060
So all down to the work that they're doing, yeah.

966
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,480
Open source is amazing.

967
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:54,980
Isn't it?

968
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,520
That is so great.

969
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,320
Jeez.

970
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,120
So not only VLC, but FFmpeg as well.

971
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,120
So kind of the standout here is maybe now the web browser.

972
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,760
Is that right?

973
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,680
So I'm a fair way along in doing that.

974
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,120
I actually have a build of Chromium

975
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,800
that is fully accelerated for the Raspberry Pi,

976
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,960
again, because literally this weekend, the Raspberry Pi

977
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,480
Foundation dropped patches for current versions of Chromium.

978
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,440
Now, the issue that I have is a rather complicated one

979
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,280
in that the builders for ARM in Launchpad are based on ARM64.

980
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,600
And obviously, the Raspberry Pi is a 32-bit ARM.

981
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,320
And the cross-build environment is

982
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,220
leaking a bit of the 64-bit nature of the host underneath.

983
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,560
And I'm running into a few issues

984
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,000
where it's picking up, oh, this should be 64-bit

985
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,280
when actually it's 32-bit.

986
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,800
So I'm just having to patch my way through that.

987
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,720
But the problem is Chromium takes about 26 hours

988
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,840
to build on ARM, even in Launchpad.

989
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,400
So my iteration cycle is currently around 11 hours

990
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,480
to find out whether or not my fixes are working.

991
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,460
So I had a failure condition at about four hours and a half,

992
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,040
and then at seven and a half hours.

993
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,800
And now the current problem I'm fighting

994
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,360
is about 11 and a half hours into the build.

995
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,920
So I'm slowly getting there.

996
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,980
But I hope, maybe not for release,

997
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,560
but it'll certainly be a post-install option,

998
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,560
an accelerated version of Chromium.

999
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,800
I'd like to have it baked in, but we'll just

1000
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,360
have to see how it goes.

1001
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,960
Like I say, the iteration time is pretty long.

1002
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,920
That is brutal.

1003
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,900
So even more kudos to you for fighting through that.

1004
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,320
I love that ffmpeg and VLC at least got this.

1005
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,360
Because if you think about it, this is the 1804 LTS.

1006
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,400
So this could be running on some Pi's for a while.

1007
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,880
This could stick around for a while.

1008
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,600
So it's really nice to see that.

1009
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,400
I think the other thing that's really clever

1010
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,640
that you've included in this release is Steam Link.

1011
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,940
How'd you get that idea?

1012
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,400
Well, yeah, so that was obviously

1013
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,240
made available for the Raspberry Pi

1014
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,320
shortly after Valve discontinued the hardware

1015
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,720
devices of Steam Link.

1016
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,440
And it just occurred to me that that is a really good use

1017
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,000
case for a Raspberry Pi to create a head-end unit

1018
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,520
for your Steam streaming.

1019
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,120
So yeah, I put a bit of work in there.

1020
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,960
This is actually the opposite kind of problem,

1021
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,920
where I had to port older libraries to the system

1022
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,680
and not have them tread on the newer versions that are in 1804.

1023
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,840
So there was a little bit of delicate refactoring

1024
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,960
of some packages to provide some older versions of things

1025
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,080
that sit alongside current versions of things.

1026
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,320
But yeah, I'm pretty happy with that.

1027
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,040
Something I would like people to test,

1028
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,920
I can't obviously fix Steam Link itself,

1029
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,400
because that's all built from upstream binary blobs.

1030
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,920
I can't recompile it, but I'd certainly

1031
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,200
appreciate some feedback on how it's working.

1032
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,120
You know what strikes me about creating a distribution

1033
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,000
for the Raspberry Pi?

1034
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,840
Most distros have to be compatible with almost all

1035
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,240
of the x86 machines in the market, in theory.

1036
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,280
You expect that if it's an x86 machine with standard hardware,

1037
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,720
a distro will run on it.

1038
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,720
But a distribution built for the Raspberry Pi,

1039
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,160
there's really only like four or five, maybe three,

1040
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,240
devices you should expect it to run really well on

1041
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,600
that you have to test on.

1042
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,200
I'm not trying to say it's easy.

1043
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,920
I'm saying it is an opportunity.

1044
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,080
If this was a full-time job, and you

1045
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,240
had a team of developers, you could

1046
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,920
buy each one of them, the entire range of Raspberry Pis.

1047
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,120
They could do all of their quality assurance testing

1048
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,440
on that.

1049
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,560
They could stamp it with their quality seal of approval

1050
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,880
and say, Mr. Wimpy, we have tested on every single Raspberry

1051
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,380
Pi.

1052
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,480
It is a manageable, scopable problem.

1053
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,480
And that's interesting.

1054
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,360
I have all four of the Raspberry Pis that this will run on.

1055
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,440
And it's not an expensive outlay to buy all four of them.

1056
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,600
It's under $100 to own all four of those computers.

1057
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:07,560
But unlike x86, everything about this is extremely bespoke.

1058
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,120
It's got its own bootloader.

1059
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,840
It's got its own custom kernel.

1060
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:16,400
It's got its own bespoke way of enabling Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

1061
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,600
It's got its own considerations regarding GPIO.

1062
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,840
Then you've got things like Python module support,

1063
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,520
adding things like USB boot support, frame buffer support.

1064
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,940
And then we've got all that we've

1065
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,920
talked about with hardware acceleration.

1066
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,160
And then you have people who have some expectation of what

1067
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,160
you do with a Raspberry Pi because of Raspbian

1068
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,640
and the tools that exist in Raspbian.

1069
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,680
And if those tools are not available in a Raspberry Pi

1070
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,520
distro, then that is alien because a lot of the time,

1071
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,840
people using the Raspberry Pi don't think of themselves

1072
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,760
as Linux users.

1073
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,900
They think of themselves as Raspberry Pi users.

1074
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,020
So you have to then make sure that those tools are available

1075
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,400
and ported because there are, in fact,

1076
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,440
considerable differences between Raspbian and Ubuntu.

1077
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,680
So there's a tool called RaspiConfig

1078
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,920
that a lot of people will be familiar with.

1079
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,440
And I've ported that from Raspbian to Ubuntu

1080
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,800
and catered for the differences that exist

1081
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,200
between the two platforms.

1082
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,720
Yeah, it is not as easy as I just made it sound.

1083
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,540
But it's a fascinating, it almost,

1084
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,620
Billy, doesn't it kind of remind you of the Android versus iOS

1085
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,960
development paradigm?

1086
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,960
Yeah, exactly.

1087
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,520
Maybe a little bit lesser because on Android,

1088
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:33,840
we're working with Java, but definitely.

1089
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,080
Yeah, and Billy does a little Android development.

1090
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,160
And he says sometimes, he feels a little jealous

1091
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,900
when you look over at the iOS side.

1092
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,400
There's less devices to target.

1093
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:43,000
Yeah, it's not just a big old mess.

1094
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,080
Imagine if the Raspberry Pi was much, much, much, much larger.

1095
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,720
And it was maybe much more mainstream.

1096
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,560
Maybe that's where the bulk of the users were.

1097
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,160
So it wasn't so bespoke.

1098
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,820
I don't know if that'd be a great future.

1099
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,480
But in a way, it would be less fragmentation.

1100
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,440
I think it's a really great device to target.

1101
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,600
I mean, I think they announced just recently they've

1102
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,840
sold 25 million Raspberry Pi.

1103
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,240
Now, I don't know how many of those

1104
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,880
are the Raspberry Pi 2, 3, 3 Plus, and 3a Plus.

1105
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,760
But I imagine it's probably the lion's share of those.

1106
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:15,800
So it's a large audience to hit.

1107
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,360
So it's a great way to do this.

1108
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,360
And the one thing I've done this time, of course,

1109
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:23,400
we've got 32-bit ARM and 64-bit ARM images.

1110
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,520
Now, there's some caveats with the 64-bit version.

1111
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,160
But it does mean that now, on an expensive device,

1112
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,080
if you want to create projects to target Ubuntu on ARM,

1113
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,920
you've now got a ubiquitous platform

1114
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,640
that you can now test your applications on 32-bit ARM

1115
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,960
and 64-bit ARM.

1116
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,160
They're good enough for that.

1117
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,240
The 64-bit systems are missing pretty much all

1118
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,680
of this hardware acceleration that we've

1119
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:56,080
discussed because it's simply not available for 64-bit ARM.

1120
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,880
It's really, I mean, it's amazing that all of this

1121
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:01,840
works as well as it does on such a different environment.

1122
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,720
I know.

1123
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,980
It does feel like it's moon computers.

1124
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,520
It's a totally different system.

1125
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,200
And we're making contact.

1126
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,800
And they're building the spaceships

1127
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,760
to get us there right now.

1128
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,240
Well, I think it's looking like a solid release.

1129
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,160
It's in beta right now.

1130
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,960
So folks, go give it a try.

1131
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,120
And it's just one SD card flash away.

1132
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,200
So why not?

1133
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,080
That's one of the things I think that makes the Raspberry Pi so

1134
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:27,880
approachable is you can get a fairly reasonably priced SD

1135
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,520
card, throw an image on there, and try it and swap it out.

1136
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,540
Or use that fancy new USB boot.

1137
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,000
You know what it's like?

1138
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,760
It's like floppy disk.

1139
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,760
Back in the day, I would have my entire operating system

1140
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,520
on a floppy disk.

1141
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,200
And I would have custom bespoke floppy disk

1142
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,320
for different games with optimized environments.

1143
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,200
And I would boot from a floppy drive.

1144
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,440
And now we're doing it with SD cards and Raspberry Pis.

1145
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,120
And I just now made that connection.

1146
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,840
Why is it taking me so long to realize

1147
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,040
these are floppy disks all over again?

1148
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,880
Now, where can we find a floppy disk

1149
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,280
reader for the Raspberry Pi?

1150
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,240
That's my next question.

1151
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,200
Yeah, well, you know what?

1152
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,200
It's got to be out there.

1153
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,040
There's a floppy disk that has an SD card.

1154
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,440
It's like an SD card adapter, like the floppy.

1155
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,840
That's got to be a thing.

1156
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,400
That has got to be a thing.

1157
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,760
I'm not trying to get all the secrets out of System76.

1158
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,480
But I'm wondering if Emma would tell us, on a scale of 1 to 10,

1159
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,040
maybe.

1160
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:18,960
I don't know.

1161
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,600
If there's any kind of hint, maybe,

1162
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,220
that System76 has looked at these ARM devices

1163
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,800
and thought, maybe there's something here we could ship.

1164
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,200
Maybe there's a product out of this.

1165
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,560
What can you reveal, Emma?

1166
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,120
I really don't think that they have been

1167
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,640
looking into that at all.

1168
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,280
So no all-pink Raspberry Pi?

1169
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:39,880
No ARM laptop or something like that?

1170
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,360
I mean, it's possible.

1171
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,200
But I haven't been part of any of the discussions.

1172
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,600
I know the ARM server is our biggest performer

1173
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,680
with the ARM market.

1174
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,600
So you do sell an ARM product, then, I guess,

1175
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,800
in the server space.

1176
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,440
Yeah.

1177
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,160
It's a bit of a beast, too, if I recall.

1178
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,600
Yes, the ibex.

1179
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,440
Yeah.

1180
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,640
Are you looking it up right now?

1181
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,560
Yeah, Wes is going over there right now to go check it out.

1182
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,520
I'm going to go over to System76 real quick.

1183
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,080
Yeah.

1184
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,360
As you do, you know.

1185
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,240
I don't know what I'd ever use an ARM server for,

1186
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,560
but I wish I had a use for it.

1187
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,640
It just seems super cool.

1188
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,440
I guess a NAS.

1189
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,240
I could build a NAS out of an ARM server.

1190
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,840
Well, I'm going to hold out.

1191
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,320
I see a future one day where there

1192
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:20,200
is a laser-engraved System76 aluminum laptop with an ARM.

1193
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,540
I don't know why I care, actually.

1194
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,280
I think x86 is doing great.

1195
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,120
Long live x86, I say.

1196
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,600
Hey, long live x86.

1197
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,880
All right, a little housekeeping.

1198
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,240
Some big things to talk about, including some awards

1199
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,560
and whatnot coming down the pipe.

1200
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,160
Award shows.

1201
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,440
Did you know that the open source community

1202
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,160
has award shows?

1203
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,200
I did not.

1204
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,240
Not only does it have award shows,

1205
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,520
apparently it's had them for years.

1206
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,720
I probably even talked about them on the show before.

1207
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,360
God, what is the matter with me?

1208
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,360
Clearly, you place a very high value on awards.

1209
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,440
Yeah.

1210
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,360
I really, I really, yeah, OK.

1211
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,640
Anyways, but you know, some people do.

1212
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,120
Some people do, and it's totally fine.

1213
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,760
Are we going to have a viewing party here at the studio?

1214
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:57,500
That's what you're saying?

1215
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,000
Oh, yeah.

1216
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:58,560
You know what?

1217
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,160
If they live stream it, we should.

1218
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,000
I'll tell you what.

1219
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,400
If they live stream it, that would actually be pretty cool.

1220
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,640
But we do have a couple of big things to talk about.

1221
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,040
Wes just got done with an Ansible study group.

1222
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,400
Just did one before the show.

1223
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,120
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1224
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,480
With demos and all.

1225
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,400
And he and Elle went through the basics of Ansible,

1226
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,160
described a little about use cases of Ansible,

1227
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,880
and then you even gave a demonstration.

1228
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,040
A nice one, too.

1229
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,200
A nice, clear, easy to understand demonstration.

1230
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,440
A demo, if you will.

1231
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,500
And it's done now.

1232
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,000
The live stream has concluded, but we

1233
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,820
will release that video in the future on the YouTube channel.

1234
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,280
Something to look forward to.

1235
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,400
We'll have probably a link next week.

1236
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,740
In the meantime, if you missed it

1237
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,800
and you just prefer to take it, Elle

1238
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,680
has now released the Ansible Quick Start course for free,

1239
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,320
along with a bunch of other things,

1240
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,320
including using Ansible for configuration management

1241
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,480
and deployments, Google App Engine Deep Dive,

1242
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,560
DevSecOps Essentials.

1243
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,680
See, what's so dangerous here is you start with the Ansible

1244
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,120
Quick Start, and you get a whole bunch of servers set up.

1245
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,480
And then now, since you can configure them with Ansible,

1246
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,440
you take all the rest of that free content,

1247
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,680
and suddenly you're hooked on the cloud.

1248
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,920
I know, that's true, yeah.

1249
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,880
PowerShell Core for Linux admins.

1250
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,560
You know, I got to admit, I'm just a tiny bit curious.

1251
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,280
Like, I kind of am curious.

1252
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,200
So we have this community edition thing,

1253
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,400
and that's what Elle and I are in charge of.

1254
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,940
We release these courses every month.

1255
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,320
There's a whole bunch that are always free,

1256
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,640
and then there's new ones that get released every month.

1257
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,600
Some get turned back to paid only.

1258
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,480
But you can sign up for a community account

1259
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,560
and go try them out.

1260
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,240
It's pretty good.

1261
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,000
I'll have a signed-in link in the show notes

1262
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,760
for the Ansible ones.

1263
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,000
So if you're logged into the platform

1264
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,640
and want to go right to the course,

1265
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,640
I'll have a link in the show notes.

1266
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:35,680
That works great.

1267
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,320
Yeah.

1268
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,360
That'd be pretty cool.

1269
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:39,080
So I just want to let you know about that.

1270
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,520
So we'll have that posted up on the YouTube channel, Wes's

1271
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,040
study group soon.

1272
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,240
It'll be a little bit, because we got to encode it,

1273
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,360
and that takes a long time.

1274
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,880
Just a little post-processing.

1275
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,880
We got rid of all of our video computers,

1276
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,680
and then all of a sudden, we decided to do a video thing.

1277
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,560
So we got to go back into the garage.

1278
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,360
No, I'm kidding.

1279
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,160
I'm kidding.

1280
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,840
It'll just take a little bit.

1281
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:02,000
Now, we also do have these open source awards, the UK Open

1282
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,480
Source Awards 2019 in Edinburgh, June 12, 2019.

1283
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,800
70 days, 8 hours, 54 minutes, and 15 seconds

1284
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,200
from when we record.

1285
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:16,660
The awards event will be at a university,

1286
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,580
and you can go there.

1287
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,280
There's going to be, I think, a little drink

1288
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,800
section, a little show thing.

1289
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,640
It's kind of like a show and an event kind of thing.

1290
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,000
So there'll be booths and all that kind of stuff, I think,

1291
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,920
and as well as awards.

1292
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,520
And the nominations are still open as well in five categories

1293
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,240
for individuals and organizations

1294
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,400
who have, in the last year, shown exceptional initiative

1295
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,160
with free software and open source software.

1296
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,840
Well, obviously, Wes Payne, you should

1297
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,960
get the individual award, company award,

1298
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,480
and public sector award.

1299
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,840
Yeah, I'm all right with that.

1300
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,380
I assume that comes with a free ticket

1301
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,160
to the event, which sounds lovely.

1302
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,480
But really, there are so many projects

1303
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,720
that can fit that bill, so go out and nominate.

1304
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,160
Yeah, OK, maybe not.

1305
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,240
But I feel like, you know, maybe you could nominate.

1306
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,400
Somebody could go and nominate, Wes,

1307
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,000
because the nominations are still open, right?

1308
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,680
So somebody should nominate him for something.

1309
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,600
You saying I haven't done that for myself already?

1310
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,240
You know, we do have some stuff up on that GitHub repo.

1311
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,520
We do have some stuff.

1312
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,520
You know, cheese, while we're still in housekeeping,

1313
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,920
we ought to just, like, tease a little bit is the big look

1314
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,720
change that's coming, like, within days,

1315
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,640
within days as we record this.

1316
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:27,680
Yeah, we're nearing the first rollout phase.

1317
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,520
Which means we're, right now, in crunch time.

1318
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,200
Cheese, right now, is in crunch mode.

1319
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,920
Yeah, I'm working on stuff as we're in the show

1320
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,080
right now, actually.

1321
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,880
We've just strapped the microphone to his face.

1322
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,800
He's still designing with his hands, it's sad.

1323
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,640
You're podcasting and designing at the same time, huh?

1324
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,040
Well, there's so many, there's so many.

1325
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,200
I wish we had an account.

1326
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,240
We don't have time to count, but there's maybe

1327
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:49,640
1,000 art assets in total.

1328
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,440
Way more than I expected.

1329
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,440
There's a ton of stuff out there.

1330
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,240
Plus, you know, we're also getting the swag.

1331
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,240
Most of those orders have all been placed,

1332
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,240
so I think people are going to be happy with that.

1333
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,160
Yeah, Linux Fest Northwest way.

1334
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,360
You know, and I've had some people asking me, you know,

1335
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,700
if I show up or, you know, do I not get the stickers?

1336
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,720
Can I not get them?

1337
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,160
We do have some stuff in the works, some things in the work

1338
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,360
to make those items available to other individuals.

1339
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,440
Yeah, initially, they're just going to be at Linux Fest, but.

1340
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,680
Sort of a trial run here.

1341
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,200
Yeah, down the road, down the road.

1342
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:24,720
It should be available to more people.

1343
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,200
Yeah, that's going to be really cool.

1344
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,680
Also, along with all of that, we're probably doing too much.

1345
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,680
But it's so exciting to have our own designer now.

1346
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:33,160
It's amazing.

1347
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,120
She's just the best.

1348
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,040
We kind of went crazy.

1349
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:40,520
We also are working on revamping the website a little bit.

1350
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,880
Cleaning it up, trying to make it a little faster,

1351
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,000
updating the look.

1352
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,440
There will be a couple of features

1353
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,700
that get removed initially, and then we'll work them back

1354
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,260
in a new way.

1355
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,240
Stuff like that is coming soon to the website.

1356
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,320
It's definitely evolving.

1357
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,880
I think people are going to find it's a lot easier

1358
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,680
to identify the shows that they like

1359
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,760
and they want to listen to.

1360
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,400
I think it's going to be, you know,

1361
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,780
people have been asking for it.

1362
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,960
We've been listening.

1363
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:09,080
I'm here to try and help this all happen.

1364
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,440
We got a new look.

1365
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,520
The individual show pages will get updated as well

1366
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,960
with the new look.

1367
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,520
It's a full spectrum new look.

1368
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,880
We may start, just to get it right,

1369
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,680
we might roll it out in phases.

1370
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,080
So you might see it update in a few places,

1371
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,720
and then there'll still be some art assets out there

1372
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,480
that we haven't gotten to.

1373
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,280
And then in a couple of days, we'll get to those.

1374
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,400
In a couple of days after that, we'll get to the rest.

1375
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,480
But there's so many.

1376
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,160
Just today, I was logging into Twitch,

1377
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,240
and I'm like, oh yeah, right, Twitch.

1378
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,000
We got Twitch.

1379
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,880
We got a Twitch art thing we got to do.

1380
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,400
And Ustream's got a background for when we're not

1381
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,800
streaming that has to get updated.

1382
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,680
There's so much stuff.

1383
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,180
Because we're doing the network logo.

1384
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,160
We're doing everything.

1385
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,600
It's very, very exciting.

1386
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,160
And of course, nobody likes a logo change.

1387
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,360
So give it a little time.

1388
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,000
Let it sink in.

1389
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,800
I think everyone will find something to like.

1390
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,360
Yeah, I hope so.

1391
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,200
I think it'll make a lot of sense to people,

1392
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,280
the brand change for JB.

1393
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,320
And one of the best benefits of this job

1394
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,440
is that after I'm done grinding away on this stuff all day,

1395
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,800
I can actually go take Linux Academy courses.

1396
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,600
That's true.

1397
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,600
Yeah, you did that last night, you maniac.

1398
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,060
Another free one out there that I really recommend people check

1399
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,880
out is the one that Kenny did.

1400
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,080
And I think you mentioned it on a previous show, the Linux

1401
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,760
operating system fundamentals.

1402
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,400
I'm just starting from the very bottom,

1403
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,240
basically all of the community courses.

1404
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,920
And I'm going to work through that

1405
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,400
and hopefully be able to give you guys some feedback on those

1406
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:29,920
as well.

1407
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,040
Right on.

1408
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,580
Well, come say hi to Cheese, Wes, and myself,

1409
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,760
as well as Wimpy and many others at Linux Fest.

1410
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,520
And get the new swag items there.

1411
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:40,960
And then we'll get them up in other ways as well.

1412
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,000
But that's the housekeeping.

1413
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,120
Thank you, everybody.

1414
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,680
Now, let's get to some feedback.

1415
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,320
This is something that you hear thrown around

1416
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,280
in the community a lot.

1417
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,160
So I thought it'd be fun to read on the show.

1418
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,720
Sigflup writes, and he says, I find

1419
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,320
it's a common misconception that compiling programs

1420
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,400
makes them run faster than if you

1421
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,800
were to install the same program via a binary package.

1422
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,540
I personally don't think this is the case,

1423
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,240
because compiling something is often

1424
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,720
just a mirror of how the package was built

1425
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,800
and you produce the same binary for more or less.

1426
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,760
Do you think I'm wrong?

1427
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:13,880
Maybe try to change my mind.

1428
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,040
I'd like to hear a discussion about compiling things

1429
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,120
from source and its advantages.

1430
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,360
Thanks, Sigflup.

1431
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,120
So what do you say, Wes?

1432
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,640
Let's take a first stab at this.

1433
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:26,240
Is there a difference between pulling down a software package

1434
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,800
and building it yourself versus the binary package?

1435
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,240
I think it all depends on what options you use.

1436
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,160
So perhaps depending on your system,

1437
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,180
there may be some tunables that they can't

1438
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,260
apply in the general case.

1439
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,320
And you could have a little bit of a speed up.

1440
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,000
And in many cases, there are not.

1441
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,360
But I think, actually, yes, Mr. Martin Wimpress,

1442
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,320
who's been stuck over in linked library hell,

1443
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,160
probably has a lot of thoughts about this.

1444
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:53,440
Yeah, I think you're dead right that the performance

1445
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,760
optimizations that build from source distributions tout

1446
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,640
are usually because each of the architectures

1447
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,640
that you run those distros on have tuned compiler flags

1448
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,200
specifically for that architecture.

1449
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,680
And you can get, for clever use of each of the options,

1450
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,660
you can get a small gain in performance.

1451
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:17,640
But then by aggregation of small margins,

1452
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,820
you can get a measurable improvement in performance.

1453
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:25,000
And this is what something like Clear Linux does.

1454
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,080
It's a single architecture-focused distro.

1455
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,920
It's x86, 64-bit.

1456
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,580
So consequently, they can tune that specifically

1457
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:36,720
to Intel CPUs.

1458
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,640
And that's why it runs so well on that architecture.

1459
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,640
But when you're making a multi-architecture distro,

1460
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,240
then you have to be more conservative in the compiler

1461
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:51,740
directives that you set as defaults to make sure

1462
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:56,240
that stuff works reliably across all of your architectures.

1463
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,320
And the gains are modest.

1464
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:02,160
But certainly, the rises of Gen 2 past,

1465
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,360
it's not quite like it used to be anymore.

1466
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:09,320
And that's, hey, that's me.

1467
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,080
Yeah, when I ran Gen 2, it was really

1468
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,760
to get access to things that weren't quite mainstream

1469
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,960
yet that now every distro does.

1470
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,280
And it's not a big deal.

1471
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,160
And there's no reason that I needed to build it myself.

1472
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,640
But traditionally for me, I've always

1473
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:30,400
built software because I either needed a version that

1474
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,240
was newer than the distro shipped.

1475
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,440
Yeah, that's a good reason.

1476
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,400
Or it's the only way it's distributed.

1477
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,200
Or in the past, and when I say past,

1478
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,120
it's like the far distant past now.

1479
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,920
Because I needed something that maybe distributions

1480
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,160
weren't building by default. Maybe

1481
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,400
they weren't optimizing for that particular architecture.

1482
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,040
Because back then, people were still

1483
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,160
shipping packages that were compatible with i386.

1484
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,240
It was a long time ago.

1485
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,600
And it just seemed like problem solved as time moved on.

1486
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,920
That's been my biggest go-to.

1487
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,360
I think there's really no performance advantage inherently

1488
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:08,720
to just grabbing the same exact packages in your repo

1489
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,480
versus grabbing something off of GitHub and building it.

1490
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:15,600
If it's the same version, same features,

1491
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,280
even if you could come up with a few ways

1492
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,120
to optimize it in the build, they're

1493
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,540
probably imperceptible in the performance of the application.

1494
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,880
So there's really no point from a performance standpoint.

1495
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,120
Just save yourself the time.

1496
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:28,240
And don't build it if you don't need to.

1497
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,840
One other advantage, I'd say, is

1498
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,240
sometimes for whatever reason, there's

1499
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,280
some types of software that I like

1500
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,720
to have in a bin subfolder in my home directory.

1501
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,840
And I like to have just certain programs that are just there.

1502
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,920
My package manager isn't aware of them.

1503
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,560
It's not trying to update them.

1504
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:49,800
It's not reliant on libraries throughout my system.

1505
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,560
It's like it lives in this folder.

1506
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,920
And sometimes that might be a reason

1507
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,920
why I might build something from source if it's simple enough.

1508
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,200
Right.

1509
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,120
Yeah, you might want to have a whole separate little thing.

1510
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,120
Maybe not necessarily all the way into a container or cheroot,

1511
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,120
but just a separate little dependency chain.

1512
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,120
How often do you build things from source manually these days?

1513
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,480
So not like from the AUR or anything like that,

1514
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:11,520
where you actually think, right, here's

1515
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,320
a thing I need to go and download a tarball

1516
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,840
and compile it from source.

1517
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,800
The last thing I tried to build from source

1518
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:21,840
was but, B-U-T-T, the broadcast utility that does ice cast

1519
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,360
streams.

1520
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,840
Yeah, I think audio stuff ends up

1521
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,200
making us both do it a little bit more than otherwise.

1522
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,280
Yeah, didn't you just build something recently too?

1523
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,160
Yep, totally.

1524
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,440
Yeah, so there's some weird esoteric tools here and there.

1525
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,840
But otherwise, I would say since the invention of snaps.

1526
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:36,400
Yes, right.

1527
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,120
Yeah, I mean, not for distribution.

1528
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,400
It's just gotten a lot better, snaps, PPAs,

1529
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,360
people just shipping devs.

1530
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:43,940
Yeah, what about you, Whitby?

1531
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,480
I mean, it must be different for you.

1532
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,080
No, no.

1533
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,920
So I've just upgraded from 18.10 to 19.04 today.

1534
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,680
So the first thing I noticed is I only had one PPA on my system.

1535
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,760
So there was none of that nonsense

1536
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,280
to be dealing with post-install.

1537
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,600
And also, the PPA in question had a disco release,

1538
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,040
and it automatically transitioned.

1539
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,480
I'm sorry, did you say?

1540
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,720
Everybody's too much to take on.

1541
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,880
Sorry, I had to.

1542
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,040
But I have got one bit of software

1543
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,840
that I compiled from source on my system

1544
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:19,240
right now that I had to rebuild post-upgrade,

1545
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:25,180
and that is Green with Envy, which I love, by the way.

1546
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:28,520
That is one of my favorite bits of software right now.

1547
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,960
It is brilliant.

1548
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,720
Remind me what Green with Envy does.

1549
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:35,520
For Windows users, this is MSI Afterburner

1550
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,240
for NVIDIA GPUs for Linux.

1551
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:42,400
It's so good, and I've used this to really aggressively

1552
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,240
overclock my 2080 Ti.

1553
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,520
It's amazing.

1554
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,880
And that's distributed as source right now?

1555
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,360
Well, it's available as a flat pack.

1556
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,040
They're working on a snap, and it's available as source.

1557
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:57,000
But because I'd, you might remember some months ago,

1558
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,960
talked about writing scripts to do

1559
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,440
all of this overclocking stuff, I

1560
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,960
wanted to poke around inside it.

1561
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,620
So I've been having a play, and there's

1562
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:09,240
a feature I'm working on that I want to send back upstream.

1563
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:11,800
OK, Brent, so when's the last time you, or if ever,

1564
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,320
have had to build software on Linux?

1565
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,320
Would that be interesting?

1566
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,920
Have you ever been forced to try to give it a go before?

1567
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:18,560
Great question.

1568
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,520
So I actually used to do it a lot.

1569
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,960
Well, I say a lot compared to some of you.

1570
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:28,080
I used to do it sometimes, kind of the same reason as you,

1571
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:31,760
Chris, whenever I'd find some tool that I really

1572
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,960
felt that I wanted to try but wasn't available,

1573
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,160
either in the repo or something like that.

1574
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,760
I thought, wow, this is worth the effort

1575
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,440
of jumping down a tunnel or a rabbit hole

1576
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,080
that I don't completely understand to try to make it go.

1577
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:48,920
And I'd say 50% of the time I'd get it going.

1578
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:51,560
50% of the time I wouldn't, but it'd be many, many hours.

1579
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:52,480
And I was like, ugh.

1580
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:55,080
You never know how that.configure is going to go.

1581
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:59,120
Yeah, these days I just sort of cringe whenever I see

1582
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:01,160
I need to do that, and I just look away and try something

1583
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:01,360
else.

1584
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,840
But I would say that for the tools

1585
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,040
that I really need most of the time,

1586
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,360
I never have to do it anymore, or even think about it.

1587
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,800
So we've come a long way.

1588
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:11,160
Yeah, I do the math.

1589
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:14,000
I'll be honest, I've probably just been like,

1590
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,520
I've noped out now a few times.

1591
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,000
I've probably noped out a couple of times in the last year,

1592
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,440
but it's only been a couple of times.

1593
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,240
I do think sometimes, at least audio stuff stands out,

1594
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,640
but any time you have that thing,

1595
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,040
it's kind of like a superpower.

1596
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,760
You perform the incantation, and then at the end,

1597
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,600
the software worked.

1598
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,840
Well, maybe.

1599
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,800
I think that's why people like to build their own kernels.

1600
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:34,880
That's like the ultimate.

1601
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,600
Yeah, you get to customized options,

1602
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,640
and it can be a good way to start learning stuff, right?

1603
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,160
There is that.

1604
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,680
But that's a pretty niche case.

1605
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:45,680
That's not, hmm, no.

1606
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:47,320
It's probably not, not really.

1607
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,520
Everybody could probably, if you don't do it very often,

1608
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,120
why not try it?

1609
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,440
Why not see it?

1610
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,760
That's probably something we could do more of.

1611
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,920
We have such ubiquitous access to all of these great,

1612
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,800
from complex to simple, open source applications,

1613
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,800
and that's such an easy way to learn that we kind of just

1614
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,320
avoid now.

1615
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,120
Even if you don't intend to use that as a way

1616
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:09,320
to manage software, why not give it a go and just to learn it?

1617
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,280
And our operating systems and the culture behind it

1618
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:13,600
make it easy to do so, right?

1619
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,980
You don't have to go set up some crazy Windows development

1620
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:18,120
environment with proprietary compilers.

1621
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:20,600
It's all there in just a regular package way.

1622
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,640
I'll tell you, I went from kind of like,

1623
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,280
I understood the concept of kernel modules

1624
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,960
and proprietary modules that link to the kernel.

1625
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,000
I got that.

1626
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,640
But it's nothing like actually building your own kernel

1627
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,400
where you're choosing which modules are build versus not

1628
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,040
and truly understanding really how this works

1629
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,160
and how you can have stuff just built into the kernel

1630
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:44,000
because it's free software, so you can just build it right in.

1631
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,160
Going through the process of building your own kernel

1632
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,080
and getting it to boot and creating an image out of it

1633
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,920
and all of that and updating grub,

1634
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,720
it's a very educational process.

1635
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:56,600
And there's so much documentation on how to do it

1636
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,360
that it's probably worth doing in a controlled environment,

1637
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:03,200
maybe like in a VM or on a spare system you don't need.

1638
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,040
Yeah, that's the way to do it.

1639
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:06,840
I used to do it on my main computer.

1640
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,480
It's like car maintenance, but where

1641
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,800
you can afford a practice car.

1642
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,400
Yeah, that's probably true.

1643
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,160
It probably is probably the same advice

1644
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,800
you could give to maintaining your own vehicle.

1645
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,520
All right, well, you know what?

1646
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,320
I think that's probably a good way to leave it right there.

1647
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,080
If you want to get your question into the show

1648
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:26,760
and have us discuss it, go to linuxunplug.com slash contact

1649
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:27,920
and send it in.

1650
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:28,480
Let us know.

1651
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,360
We'd love to hear it and kick it around

1652
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,120
on a future episode of The Unplugged Program.

1653
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,800
That's linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1654
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,720
You'll also find links to everything

1655
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,920
we talked about today at slash 295

1656
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:41,320
as well as in your podcast catcher.

1657
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,960
And you can subscribe to future episodes of The Unplugged

1658
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,760
Program on that page as well.

1659
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,200
We've got links all over that site.

1660
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,360
Everywhere.

1661
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,440
Well, you know, I got to say, I really

1662
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,080
enjoyed the last TechSnap.

1663
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:52,920
Aw, thank you.

1664
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,040
You guys, killing it.

1665
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:55,960
Killing it.

1666
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,720
Ways that people could attack you in the supply chain.

1667
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,320
Like, things I never even thought about.

1668
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,200
Basically everywhere.

1669
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:04,000
Yeah, it was a little hard to sleep that night.

1670
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,460
Yeah, don't listen if you're overly scared,

1671
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:07,960
but do go check it out, TechSnap.systems.

1672
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,880
Also, the Ubuntu podcast, rumor has it, may be returning soon.

1673
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:12,400
Oh, boy.

1674
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,160
I don't know.

1675
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,520
I don't know, I would just make sure I'm

1676
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,960
subscribed to the Ubuntu podcast right now.

1677
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,280
That's what I'm saying.

1678
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,080
I'd make sure you do that this week.

1679
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:19,800
Yeah.

1680
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,480
Yeah, I'd just say that's a good idea.

1681
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,140
Just make sure you're subscribed to Ubuntu podcast.

1682
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,640
Thank you for joining us, Wimpy.

1683
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:25,960
Now, thank you all for making it.

1684
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,240
We appreciate it very much.

1685
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,760
I encourage you to join us live over jblive.tv.

1686
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,120
We do it on a Tuesday.

1687
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,920
Go to jubilabroadcasting.com slash calendar

1688
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:33,680
for your time zone.

1689
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,320
See you then.

1690
01:05:34,320 --> 01:06:04,280
And we'll see you next time.

1691
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:05,240
Next Tuesday!

1692
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,520
I mean, I don't want to disappoint.

1693
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,060
All right, now we've got to pick our title, jbtitles.com.

1694
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:15,100
Thank you, guys.

1695
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:15,640
Great show.

1696
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:16,680
Really enjoyed chatting with everybody.

1697
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,400
Look at that huge Mumble Room still there.

1698
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,280
Amazing.

1699
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,400
You guys even stuck around for the whole show.

1700
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:22,600
And the post-show.

1701
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,560
So what should we call this thing?

1702
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,760
jbtitles.com.

1703
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,800
Everybody go vote.

1704
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:32,960
In the meantime, Mr. Bacon has a little community news

1705
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,240
to share with the class.

1706
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,920
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1707
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,000
So let me jump back here.

1708
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,160
Mr. Lonnie Webb, one of our community members,

1709
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:47,640
has a Kickstarter going right now called Killing Wryth One.

1710
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:52,000
And I could drop that link in the IRC here shortly,

1711
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,120
or we'll also put it in the show notes.

1712
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:59,000
Right now, basically, he's doing a comic.

1713
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,120
His goal is $750.

1714
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,800
He's at 59.

1715
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,980
He has 28 days to go.

1716
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,460
So if we could go over there and give him some love,

1717
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:09,800
I'm sure he'd appreciate it.

1718
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,720
And his stuff is actually really cool, man.

1719
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:12,240
I like it.

1720
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,440
It's the little image that he has, the video

1721
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,000
that he has there.

1722
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,800
I don't know, it reminds me of just this Orwellian pre-cyberpunk

1723
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:23,720
kind of look.

1724
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,440
It's really cool.

1725
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,360
I think everyone should go take a look at it.

1726
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,600
Is he using free software to make this comic?

1727
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,760
He does not say.

1728
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:34,080
But I'm sure I could reach out to him and ask him.

1729
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,880
We're going to assume he does.

1730
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:36,960
Let's just pretend he does.

1731
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,600
I know that a lot of it is done, it

1732
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:44,080
appears to be that he sketches a lot of it out first.

1733
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:48,280
So my guess is that he goes back in and inks it later.

1734
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,840
But I mean, I just love his style.

1735
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,360
I think it's super cool.

1736
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,320
I think a lot of people would enjoy it themselves.

1737
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:59,280
So take a look and give him a few bucks if you can.

1738
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,240
Boom.

1739
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:00,760
Nice.

1740
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,400
Hopefully it works out.

1741
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,000
It's nice to see community members working

1742
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,160
on stuff like that.

1743
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,800
All right, we've got to pick this title,

1744
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:06,840
and then we've got to go.

1745
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,300
Yeah, you thought your work was done

1746
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,680
when you suggested a title?

1747
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,080
Oh, no, my friends.

1748
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,840
This is the hardest part, because there are some really

1749
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,920
quality titles today.

1750
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,080
This is interesting to see YouTube getting a lot of crap

1751
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,840
today.

1752
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,080
A piece over at Bloomberg, YouTube executives

1753
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,880
ignored internal warnings from staff.

1754
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,840
Concerns that were brought up about toxic videos

1755
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:31,800
were ignored, and proposals to change recommendations

1756
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:36,560
were dismissed in favor of all-out chasing engagement.

1757
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,880
And they have documents as recently as 2017,

1758
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:45,880
it looks like, showing briefings to upper management

1759
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,920
in the Alphabet Corporation about how they need to pursue

1760
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,040
the engagement strategy.

1761
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,280
It's just not looking good for YouTube these days, is it?

1762
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,000
No.

1763
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:54,640
Boy.

1764
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,800
Meanwhile, today is the day to uninstall the Google Plus

1765
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:01,240
app from your phone, because we are just hours away

1766
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,760
from Google Plus being taken off the line.

1767
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:08,000
Right, I had a search result that had a Google Plus answer,

1768
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,120
and I clicked it, and I got a page that said,

1769
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:11,600
Google Plus is going away.

1770
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,120
So I was like, well, remove it from the search result, Google.

1771
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,480
You're the one that gave me the link.

1772
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,520
Like, yeah, I'll take your stuff.

1773
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,040
Look, it's hard when you cancel that many products, you know?

1774
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:20,680
I know.

1775
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:22,920
This is, it really is kind of hitting home right now,

1776
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:27,280
that Inbox is going away, which was actually kind of nice.

1777
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,880
I'll say, there was one bill I didn't know about that Inbox

1778
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,160
gave me a push notification.

1779
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:34,320
It was like, hey, homes, you better pay this thing.

1780
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,360
I was like, oh, my god.

1781
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,120
The robots are good at reading your email.

1782
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:37,640
Yeah.

1783
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,160
So Inbox just got shut down.

1784
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:42,400
Google Plus just got shut down.

1785
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,880
Meanwhile, we have multiple ways to listen to music.

1786
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,760
You have YouTube Music and Google Play Music.

1787
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,480
You've got multiple ways to do text chatting.

1788
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,080
You've got multiple ways to do video calling.

1789
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,880
Oh, Hangouts is ending later this year, too.

1790
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,920
Yeah, it's weird what remains.

1791
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,800
And it's weird what they do decide to kill.

1792
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:02,280
And it is becoming part of their brand.

1793
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,600
They launch fast, and they kill fast.

1794
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,000
And so you don't know if Stadia is going to go away.

1795
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,840
And now you don't know about any of this kind of stuff.

1796
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,800
Well, that's just dumb fresh meat entering the abattoir

1797
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:13,640
right now, isn't it?

1798
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:14,520
What, Stadia?

1799
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:15,120
Yeah.

1800
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:15,680
You think so?

1801
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,760
You think it's never going to really stick?

1802
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,920
No, I'm being facetious.

1803
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,600
I think this is one of those moon shoots that will probably

1804
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:27,800
pay off, I think, when we looked back at how crazy the Chromium

1805
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,000
Chromebooks were when they started that initiative.

1806
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,800
Everything wasn't aligned for that

1807
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,800
to be successful at the time.

1808
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:39,840
And I think that Stadia, certainly the technologies

1809
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,120
are not aligned right now for that to be a success.

1810
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:46,720
But it will take somebody like Google to make it successful.

1811
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:50,520
And I've got mixed feelings about how successful I

1812
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:51,840
want Stadia to be.

1813
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,680
Yeah.

1814
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:55,640
And I would imagine from a game developer standpoint,

1815
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:58,720
I would really have to really think about,

1816
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,560
how much development time do I want

1817
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,920
to spend to customize my game for a platform that

1818
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:08,160
is controlled by Google versus open platforms?

1819
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:11,120
I guess they do that for consoles.

1820
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,400
So I suppose you could look at it.

1821
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,440
It's almost like another console.

1822
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,280
But in this case, it could be.

1823
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,640
I mean, you already have a whole bunch of proprietary platforms

1824
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:20,560
to target.

1825
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:21,400
It will be interesting to see what we have to take.

1826
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,560
But at least when you make a console,

1827
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,440
it's out there for a while, right?

1828
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,080
This, they can turn off any time.

1829
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:28,480
But the flip side is, when the new console comes out,

1830
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,760
you can't play the old games.

1831
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,560
But with streaming, in theory, you

1832
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,160
could play everything from DOS games

1833
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,440
to the most recent crazy games.

1834
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:36,160
Right.

1835
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,360
And what I'm looking forward to seeing

1836
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,480
is those game studios in the past that

1837
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:45,800
have been absolutely ardent, we're never doing Linux,

1838
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,640
to see what their position on Stadia is going to be.

1839
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:53,080
Because whether or not you get a desktop Linux

1840
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:57,640
version of a game because you've targeted it at Stadia,

1841
01:11:57,640 --> 01:11:58,720
that's a separate point.

1842
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:01,000
But you have to target Linux in order

1843
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,320
for it to run within the Stadia infrastructure.

1844
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:08,640
So it will be fascinating to see whether anyone, Epic,

1845
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:13,440
for example, changes their opinions about porting to Linux.

1846
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:17,440
And in a way, it only has to be somewhat successful, perhaps,

1847
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:19,040
for that to happen.

1848
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,080
Even because it's a whole retooling that has to happen

1849
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,940
on the dev shops part.

1850
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:27,400
So if Stadia is even semi-successful,

1851
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,400
you may see shops begin to retool around Linux, which

1852
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,240
could have long-term.

1853
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,520
Well, then they have some pretty good, like Real and Unity

1854
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,800
both have or are getting support.

1855
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,040
And you could see others falling in line, which could

1856
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,600
have good long-term ramifications.

1857
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,480
It's just so, it could go either way.

1858
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:48,960
It's a fascinating story in that regard.
