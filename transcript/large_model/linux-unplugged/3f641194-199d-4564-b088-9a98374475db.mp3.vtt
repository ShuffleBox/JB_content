00:00.000 --> 00:19.600
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 281 for December 26, 2018, our predictions episode!

00:19.600 --> 00:25.880
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's going off the unscript today.

00:25.880 --> 00:26.880
I don't know.

00:26.880 --> 00:27.880
My name is Chris.

00:27.880 --> 00:28.880
My name is Wes.

00:28.880 --> 00:29.880
And my name is Joe.

00:29.880 --> 00:30.880
Hello, gentlemen.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.400
Joe, it's great to have you on a special episode.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.760
I'll talk a little bit more about what Joe's doing here and what we'll be accomplishing.

00:36.760 --> 00:41.820
This is our opportunity to get out our crystal balls and make a prediction about 2019, where

00:41.820 --> 00:44.320
things are going in Linux.

00:44.320 --> 00:50.280
And maybe, maybe my chance to finally dominate, finally dominate the predictions.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.880
We're getting really serious this year.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.040
Don't you do this as a living?

00:53.040 --> 00:54.920
You should be able to get these things right.

00:54.920 --> 00:55.920
That's right.

00:55.920 --> 00:59.380
This year, I've watched the news closely, followed the trends and the signals, and I

00:59.380 --> 01:03.160
think I've narrowed it down to a bunch of solid wins.

01:03.160 --> 01:07.960
And Joe is here to be our ref, to really be the bastard that says, no, no, no, you need

01:07.960 --> 01:10.480
to be clear about what you're predicting.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.280
This needs to be measurable.

01:12.280 --> 01:15.520
And Joe's going to hold us accountable this episode to make sure that the predictions

01:15.520 --> 01:24.100
that Wes, myself and the Mumble Room make are easily understandable and easily measurable.

01:24.100 --> 01:29.240
So that way, at the end of next year, when we play this back, we can have easy yes or

01:29.240 --> 01:30.240
no wins.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.240
Yeah.

01:31.240 --> 01:34.480
You even need acceptance criteria tests to evaluate so that you can actually say, yes,

01:34.480 --> 01:35.480
did this production happen?

01:35.480 --> 01:36.480
Exactly.

01:36.480 --> 01:40.240
And it's got nothing to do with me not being able to do any predictions because I've wasted

01:40.240 --> 01:43.000
them all on LAN and late night Linux.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Yeah, I suppose.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.440
I mean, it might have something to do with that.

01:45.440 --> 01:48.440
We do have a predictions episode of Linux Action News about to come out.

01:48.440 --> 01:52.280
I just thought that since you correct Chris' grammar so often, you would just be a natural

01:52.280 --> 01:53.280
referee.

01:53.280 --> 01:57.040
Well, if anyone was going to call us on our BS, it would be Joe, right?

01:57.040 --> 01:59.480
So I felt like that was sort of perfect.

01:59.480 --> 02:04.040
But we will have a predictions episode of Linux Action News with a totally different

02:04.040 --> 02:05.040
set of predictions.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.480
I was really on my game this year.

02:07.480 --> 02:13.060
With it being a full year of Linux Action News, I've been deep in the news now.

02:13.060 --> 02:14.060
You're plugged in.

02:14.060 --> 02:15.160
You could say I'm unplugged too.

02:15.160 --> 02:19.320
And so I've been kind of carefully keeping track all year long.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.160
So I really brought my game face.

02:21.160 --> 02:27.760
But it's not just us, also here with their predictions is our virtual lug time appropriate

02:27.760 --> 02:28.920
greetings mumble room.

02:28.920 --> 02:29.920
Hello, everybody.

02:29.920 --> 02:30.920
Good morning.

02:30.920 --> 02:31.920
Hello.

02:31.920 --> 02:32.920
Merry Christmas.

02:32.920 --> 02:33.920
Happy New Year.

02:33.920 --> 02:34.920
Happy Holidays, everybody.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.160
So we've got Brandon in there.

02:36.160 --> 02:42.400
We got Mr. Nate in there, Bitten and Em Manson and Popeys in there and Sean and see me and

02:42.400 --> 02:45.400
the Drifter is also in there as well.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.520
And we got a few folks in the quiet listening.

02:48.520 --> 02:53.680
There is there is one stream if you could tune into that's like the most like real time

02:53.680 --> 02:54.680
high quality stream.

02:54.680 --> 02:55.680
And that's our mumble room.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.520
So you can actually we have a room in there if you just want to hang out in the quiet

02:57.520 --> 03:00.640
listening if you got nothing to say direct to the studio connection.

03:00.640 --> 03:01.640
Yeah.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.640
Yeah.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.000
Well, you know, before we start with the show, normally we would have like a pre show and

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
all that kind of stuff.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.160
But we dispensed with all of that because this is this we're not following any formats.

03:10.160 --> 03:14.400
And I thought I'd ask I'd start with with you, Wes, because I'm pretty sure I know the

03:14.400 --> 03:16.240
answer for Joe.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.720
Did you end up getting roped in any tech support this year?

03:18.720 --> 03:19.720
Oh, yeah.

03:19.720 --> 03:20.720
Just just a little bit.

03:20.720 --> 03:23.440
But I will say I was very willing.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.960
My younger brother has a like just a couple of generations old HP laptop.

03:27.960 --> 03:32.920
It runs Linux pretty darn well, except it's got one of those Broadcom Wi Fi chips.

03:32.920 --> 03:36.760
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:36.760 --> 03:37.760
Already runs?

03:37.760 --> 03:38.760
Yeah, it's already running Linux.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.760
How did this happen?

03:39.760 --> 03:40.760
So I'm doing Linux tech support.

03:40.760 --> 03:41.760
Isn't that great?

03:41.760 --> 03:42.760
That is really great.

03:42.760 --> 03:47.840
For me, the family tech supports always really bad Android devices and super old Windows

03:47.840 --> 03:48.840
computers.

03:48.840 --> 03:52.040
See, my trick is I just install Linux anyway, like they just get it there.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.800
And then I say, you know, it'll be a lot easier for me to help you.

03:54.800 --> 03:55.800
If you just use Linux.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.640
I believe that's called the Chilean maneuver.

03:57.640 --> 03:58.640
It very much is.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.860
Anyway, we were just able to pop it open.

04:00.860 --> 04:01.920
It was a little bit troublesome.

04:01.920 --> 04:05.240
There was some unfortunate screw decisions that HP made.

04:05.240 --> 04:08.480
But all in all, you know, I bought a I bought an Intel chip that works way better with open

04:08.480 --> 04:10.400
source, plugged it in, rebooted into Ubuntu.

04:10.400 --> 04:14.160
I think he's got 1804 on there right now, recognized it instantly.

04:14.160 --> 04:16.200
And now he's got solid Wi-Fi.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.800
So the process wasn't too bad, aside from the screws.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.180
Did you Amazon that part?

04:20.180 --> 04:21.340
Did you buy it in person?

04:21.340 --> 04:22.600
Did you come with it?

04:22.600 --> 04:25.440
Like what was your what was your process for getting the card?

04:25.440 --> 04:28.240
Well, you know, actually, I was able to look it up and they sold they had to they had a

04:28.240 --> 04:32.480
Broadcom and an Intel OEM model for chips that they put in that model.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.520
So I was able to just go find one on eBay and I shipped it to him kind of saying like

04:35.520 --> 04:36.520
you could learn something.

04:36.520 --> 04:37.520
Try to install this yourself.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.000
I ended up being roped into help, but I was more than happy.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Nice.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
That is a ninja move.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.320
I mean, here's hoping that like most of the time I've never had to do that before.

04:45.320 --> 04:49.240
I mean, I've always known you could of course, but laptops these days are just good enough

04:49.240 --> 04:50.960
and that makes me hopeful for 2019.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.400
Hopefully that's the first and last time I do it.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.520
Joe I'm pretty sure I know the answer.

04:55.520 --> 05:01.760
Do you get roped in the any kind of family tech support scenarios in the holidays or

05:01.760 --> 05:03.360
have you successfully avoided all that?

05:03.360 --> 05:06.400
Well, I almost managed to successfully avoid my entire family.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.400
So that was a win.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.400
Bravo.

05:08.400 --> 05:15.480
I did go and see my parents and my mom was struggling to find her bookmarks on her iPhone

05:15.480 --> 05:21.080
on Chrome on iOS and she'd followed some guide and created like a folder within a folder

05:21.080 --> 05:22.080
within a folder.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.080
Oh no.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.080
So she was kind of stuck in there.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.320
So I had to go back, back, back, delete that.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.380
And then I showed her how to do it.

05:26.380 --> 05:29.960
So we'll see next time I see her, probably in the new year, go and see her and see if

05:29.960 --> 05:30.960
she's fixed that.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.960
But yeah, I can't believe the only tech support I did was iOS based and I don't know anything

05:33.960 --> 05:37.280
about iOS.

05:37.280 --> 05:38.280
That's pretty great.

05:38.280 --> 05:39.280
Okay.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.260
Well, you're not going to believe my family tech support story.

05:41.260 --> 05:46.760
So first of all, my Christmas day, after we got done with the kids early morning, we dropped

05:46.760 --> 05:52.640
them off with their mom and the plan was to do nothing except for just slowly cook and

05:52.640 --> 05:53.640
watch Deep Space Nine.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.440
Oh, that sounds like the best day.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.680
It was really good.

05:56.680 --> 06:01.680
First of all, the season finale for season five of Deep Space Nine is really good.

06:01.680 --> 06:02.680
It's really, really good.

06:02.680 --> 06:03.680
Oh, you're just making me drool here.

06:03.680 --> 06:04.680
I'm on my way there.

06:04.680 --> 06:05.680
Yeah.

06:05.680 --> 06:08.200
Plus we, you know, slow cook some meat, you know, and that was really good too.

06:08.200 --> 06:15.440
But my mom talked me into coming down to visit and she was, she really, she next level manipulated

06:15.440 --> 06:16.440
me too.

06:16.440 --> 06:21.480
First, she got me to, to proudly describe my plans for having a super chill day.

06:21.480 --> 06:25.040
And then she comes in with the, with the, but my car just broke down sob story.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.040
Oh no.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.040
And then comes in with that.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.080
Well, Hey, since you got nothing coming up, going on anyways, why don't you just come

06:30.080 --> 06:32.000
visit me real quick.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
And what do I say at that point?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
I put all my cards on the table.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.440
I can't say, sorry, mom, I'm busy.

06:35.440 --> 06:36.440
There's no lies left.

06:36.440 --> 06:37.440
Yeah.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.920
And she, and she played me.

06:38.920 --> 06:39.920
She played me.

06:39.920 --> 06:40.920
I think she knows you pretty darn well.

06:40.920 --> 06:41.920
She does.

06:41.920 --> 06:42.920
And she knows she played me too.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.800
So I ended up down there at mom's house and she's like, before you come down, I just want

06:45.800 --> 06:47.720
you to know I'm having this problem with my computer.

06:47.720 --> 06:49.480
I want to get access to my old data.

06:49.480 --> 06:50.480
I'm like, your old data?

06:50.480 --> 06:51.480
What do you mean your old data?

06:51.480 --> 06:57.360
Well, I got this older computer, um, in about, about five years ago, my mom, she, she got

06:57.360 --> 06:59.600
a new machine and I'm like, Oh, okay.

06:59.600 --> 07:00.600
All right.

07:00.600 --> 07:01.600
Well, um, what's the problem?

07:01.600 --> 07:04.080
Well, I'm plugging the drive in and I can't get to my data.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.080
I'm like, okay.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.080
All right.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.080
Well, let's, uh, so I, I get data.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.120
I get down there.

07:08.120 --> 07:15.000
And what I discover is that she has an old power PC Macintosh, okay.

07:15.000 --> 07:21.960
That she is trying to plug into her son's, my, my half-brother's windows 10 PC.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.200
What plug in hell?

07:23.200 --> 07:29.720
Well, she's got the power connector, but there's, there's no IDE connector in the entire case,

07:29.720 --> 07:30.720
right?

07:30.720 --> 07:31.720
It's all SATA.

07:31.720 --> 07:32.720
His ring is all SATA, right?

07:32.720 --> 07:33.720
And it's an old IDE cable.

07:33.720 --> 07:37.760
I'm plugging it in and it's spinning up and she knows enough to know like the drive spinning

07:37.760 --> 07:38.760
and it's powered up.

07:38.760 --> 07:39.760
Oh, wow.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.760
And she knows enough.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.280
She's looking at the other ones like the connectors are small, but it's not showing up.

07:43.280 --> 07:46.720
I don't see a D drive and I want to get to my files like she doesn't have, but she doesn't

07:46.720 --> 07:48.160
know that's HFS.

07:48.160 --> 07:51.220
She doesn't know that's a total different connection interface, right?

07:51.220 --> 07:54.120
So I brought down with me one of these old toasters.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.760
Do you remember these like a USB toaster?

07:55.760 --> 07:58.600
Oh, you just jump, dump a drive in and then, yeah.

07:58.600 --> 08:03.280
And it's an old IDE toaster with a USB B to USB A.

08:03.280 --> 08:06.560
But I take the old ThinkPad down there that has a handy USB A port, one of those quote

08:06.560 --> 08:08.560
unquote legacy ports that nobody uses.

08:08.560 --> 08:14.120
And I plug it in and of course, you know, GNU slash Linux and I got the HFS drive.

08:14.120 --> 08:18.040
I mount her new computer over the network and I copy the data over for her.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.040
Beautiful.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.040
Yeah.

08:20.040 --> 08:23.440
It was, but just to go in there and like not quite knowing what to expect and to walk in

08:23.440 --> 08:29.140
on this Windows 10 PC, which my mom has attempted to essentially take apart and like the case

08:29.140 --> 08:32.800
is still open and the drive is just hanging there by the power adapter.

08:32.800 --> 08:36.600
And like it's slowly dawning on me what she's attempting to pull off.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.520
And my thought was like, you know, mom, it just would have been easier to power up the

08:39.520 --> 08:44.240
old Mac, put it on the network, just copy the files or put it on an external hard drive.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.240
Any of that.

08:45.240 --> 08:46.240
Right.

08:46.240 --> 08:49.560
But, you know, she just thought she, to her, like it's a disk, it's a computer.

08:49.560 --> 08:53.520
It's the same kind of connector for the power, the level of knowledge that's like just enough

08:53.520 --> 08:55.240
to be very dangerous.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.240
Yeah.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.240
Yeah.

08:57.240 --> 08:58.240
That just about describes it.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.880
So that was my holiday tech support experience.

09:00.880 --> 09:05.240
And that was, and I didn't, I didn't plan to have any because I kept it pretty minimal.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.280
This is my most minimal family thing.

09:07.280 --> 09:12.600
I only went to two official family events, different family events.

09:12.600 --> 09:16.920
And I thought I had, I had gotten out just completely with unscathed.

09:16.920 --> 09:20.160
And then this came in at the last minute as a, as a little twist.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.160
Well, you're a good son.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.440
It was pretty funny.

09:23.440 --> 09:27.080
These old, these old power Macs, like they have these reflective mirrored drives.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.080
Oh yeah.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.560
They call them the mirrored doors.

09:29.560 --> 09:34.560
And then it's got like these air intake vents, like a Cadillac to like take in air to like

09:34.560 --> 09:37.680
cool the G4 processor.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.500
It's a ridiculous contraption and it makes a lot of noise.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.560
It was a very loud Mac.

09:42.560 --> 09:47.220
It was a different era, but all right, that's not what we're here to talk about today.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.920
This episode is really about our predictions for 2019.

09:49.920 --> 09:56.440
We wanted to get it in, in 2018, firmly while still inside the boundary of 2018.

09:56.440 --> 10:01.760
So that way these are clean predictions, fair and fair, made before the year arrives.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.880
Now to some of us, these predictions will seem a little obvious to others.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.880
They're going to seem like long shots.

10:06.880 --> 10:11.760
What we decided to do this year was set some ground rules that we all have to play by.

10:11.760 --> 10:19.000
We're taking it serious this year and I'm going to warn you, I apologize ahead of time.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.600
After much deliberation, we have decided to introduce a process.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.480
None of us like it, but it had to happen.

10:27.480 --> 10:28.520
First of all, we need a ref.

10:28.520 --> 10:29.520
That's Joe's role.

10:29.520 --> 10:34.040
Joe will be playing the role of the referee, keeping us on the straight and narrow, making

10:34.040 --> 10:38.240
sure that all predictions are measurable, making sure that the predictions are clear

10:38.240 --> 10:44.920
and specific, and Joe will be asking us at the end after we debate them if needed or

10:44.920 --> 10:45.920
need any clarification.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.680
Right, a refinement process when they're proposed to the group.

10:48.680 --> 10:52.280
Which is a friendly space, no judgment.

10:52.280 --> 10:56.720
At the end of that process, Joe will ask us to restate the prediction one more time, so

10:56.720 --> 11:02.640
that way it's clear and concise, and once the prediction is made final, it will be signaled

11:02.640 --> 11:05.220
with the final ding.

11:05.220 --> 11:07.400
That means prediction locked.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.480
And we will move on to the next one.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.480
No changing it.

11:09.480 --> 11:10.480
No changing it.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.480
It is in the official show record.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.440
Now I'm very excited about this.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.440
Do you have predictions?

11:16.440 --> 11:17.440
Oh yeah.

11:17.440 --> 11:18.440
Because they're not in the doc yet.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.440
No, no.

11:19.440 --> 11:20.440
Yeah, I got them right here.

11:20.440 --> 11:21.440
I know you sneaky jerk.

11:21.440 --> 11:26.000
So, Mumba Room, you are welcome.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.640
I just have to ask, is anyone going to make the year of the Linux desktop prediction?

11:30.640 --> 11:33.240
Because if you are, we can just get that out of the way right now.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.360
Because let's be honest, hands up.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.360
Everybody wants that one.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.860
Does anybody in the Mumba Room want to make a prediction that is actually legitimately

11:39.860 --> 11:41.600
the year of the Linux desktop?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.480
Every year is the year of the Linux desktop.

11:43.480 --> 11:44.480
All right.

11:44.480 --> 11:45.480
Very fair.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.920
I mean, I think that's the answer we've all decided to go with that makes us comfortable

11:48.920 --> 11:50.960
at this point.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.200
We keep telling ourselves that.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.840
Joe, I think you can be the decider there.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.000
Do you think it's your call?

11:56.000 --> 12:00.800
Is that a prediction on Bittens or I mean, every year is the year of Linux desktop?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.160
Doesn't feel like a prediction to me.

12:02.160 --> 12:07.400
No, anything to do with year of Linux desktop just gets instantly taken out of the equation,

12:07.400 --> 12:08.400
I'm afraid.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.400
We're not having it.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.840
We had to have that conversation.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.020
People listening, they want to know.

12:12.020 --> 12:15.600
We had to have that conversation.

12:15.600 --> 12:20.380
I do think there could be room for a Chrome OS prediction in this space, but that's not

12:20.380 --> 12:21.400
one of mine.

12:21.400 --> 12:25.160
So I think maybe I'll start and then maybe you can give one.

12:25.160 --> 12:29.200
But I thought I'd start with one to help us just warm up because this is my most vague

12:29.200 --> 12:32.400
prediction and I think we need to kick it around a little bit.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.000
But I think this is going to happen.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.740
And I don't think you're going to be surprised when I say this.

12:37.740 --> 12:44.560
One of my first predictions for 2019 is that dark mode for the web becomes a design trend

12:44.560 --> 12:47.680
and websites start going dark.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.960
Is this something universal or is it a toggle?

12:49.960 --> 12:54.800
Is this some sort of universal cookie that gets set and shared?

12:54.800 --> 12:56.520
What's my experience in the dark mode?

12:56.520 --> 12:57.520
Do I have to define that?

12:57.520 --> 12:58.520
Maybe not.

12:58.520 --> 13:01.640
I don't feel like I have to define that because I think each site could implement it differently.

13:01.640 --> 13:05.600
But you just think a lot of sites will have a dark mode or will be just a dark design.

13:05.600 --> 13:06.600
Yeah.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.800
I mean, there's several factors at play here.

13:07.800 --> 13:11.200
So you've got the fact that dark mode has been an option on Linux forever.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.360
You've got commercial desktops that are offering more dark modes now.

13:14.360 --> 13:18.400
You've got the fact that OLED screens on mobile devices have significant battery savings when

13:18.400 --> 13:19.760
you use dark mode.

13:19.760 --> 13:22.360
So there's a lot of pressure mechanisms.

13:22.360 --> 13:26.000
The other one that I've noticed is a general user pressure.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.280
And you saw me talking to one of the users at System76.

13:29.280 --> 13:34.500
When I've been, as I travel around, Wes, and talk to people, when I travel around and talk

13:34.500 --> 13:38.040
to the people, Wes, they tell me about the dark mode for the browser.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.000
And I've gotten, this really is true though.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.680
I say it like I'm joking, but it is true.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.880
I've had different people tell me different types of dark mode extensions for the web

13:44.880 --> 13:46.300
browser to make it look good.

13:46.300 --> 13:47.480
And I've gone all in.

13:47.480 --> 13:51.840
I'm using dark mode on Chrome and Firefox for everything.

13:51.840 --> 13:55.720
I have dark reader on Chrome, which is great.

13:55.720 --> 14:01.720
It does a great job of making sites that aren't designed for dark mode at least readable.

14:01.720 --> 14:05.720
And I think when you combine the fact that users are manually changing the site design,

14:05.720 --> 14:07.280
so they're going dark.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.280
That's right.

14:08.280 --> 14:09.800
I mean, dark mode CSS hacks are pretty common.

14:09.800 --> 14:14.620
And dark mode is much better if you design for it than if you force it.

14:14.620 --> 14:18.200
The websites are going to have that pressure, plus the OLED screens, like I mentioned, plus

14:18.200 --> 14:22.160
the fact that commercial desktops are going dark and a lot of the user applications are

14:22.160 --> 14:26.200
going dark to complement the change of the desktop.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.720
I just think this is going to be a thing.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.120
I don't have a definition of how it's going to be implemented, Joe.

14:32.120 --> 14:33.120
I defer to your judgment.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.140
Well, the referee has to step in here.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.320
The first rule is predictions must be measurable.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.320
How are we going to measure this?

14:38.320 --> 14:39.320
Okay.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.320
All right.

14:40.320 --> 14:41.320
Fair.

14:41.320 --> 14:42.320
That's fair.

14:42.320 --> 14:43.320
That's a good question.

14:43.320 --> 14:46.480
How many major websites go dark?

14:46.480 --> 14:47.480
I'm going to say...

14:47.480 --> 14:48.480
That's still pretty vague.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.480
The New York...

14:49.480 --> 14:50.480
What are you going to say?

14:50.480 --> 14:51.480
Google.com?

14:51.480 --> 14:52.480
Is that going to go dark?

14:52.480 --> 14:53.480
Facebook?

14:53.480 --> 14:54.480
Oh!

14:54.480 --> 14:55.480
Okay.

14:55.480 --> 14:56.480
Okay.

14:56.480 --> 14:57.480
All right.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.480
So it's either Google.com or New York Times.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.480
One of those goes dark.

14:59.480 --> 15:00.480
Okay.

15:00.480 --> 15:01.480
How's that?

15:01.480 --> 15:02.480
All right.

15:02.480 --> 15:03.480
Yeah, that's measurable.

15:03.480 --> 15:04.480
All right.

15:04.480 --> 15:05.480
One of those.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.480
All right.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.480
All right.

15:07.480 --> 15:08.480
Now, I'll summarize it up.

15:08.480 --> 15:09.480
2019 will be the year of the web going dark mode and a major property like Google.com

15:09.480 --> 15:14.560
will roll out to fanfare a dark mode.

15:14.560 --> 15:15.560
Prediction locked.

15:15.560 --> 15:16.920
That felt really good.

15:16.920 --> 15:17.920
Nicely done, sir.

15:17.920 --> 15:18.920
Thank you.

15:18.920 --> 15:21.400
I really hope that happens also because I also love dark mode.

15:21.400 --> 15:22.400
Yeah.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.400
I just think it's great.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.400
That's my...

15:24.400 --> 15:26.200
That's, by the way, that was my vaguest, most non-Linux prediction.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.040
The rest are all on topic.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.040
What do you got?

15:29.040 --> 15:30.040
Okay.

15:30.040 --> 15:38.400
So I think in 2019, Gnome will have improved enough that you are using it on at least one

15:38.400 --> 15:46.120
system by year's end or used it on a system for like a couple of months.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.120
You bastard.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.120
Oh, man.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.120
Okay.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.120
I mean...

15:50.120 --> 15:51.120
That's fairly measurable.

15:51.120 --> 16:00.160
That means that Chris just has to have used it for at least 60 days on one machine in

16:00.160 --> 16:01.160
2019.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.160
Yeah.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.160
Yeah.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.160
Yeah.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.160
I agree.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.160
I agree.

16:06.160 --> 16:07.160
I hate that.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.720
I hate that I hate that I hate that I hate that I hate that I think you're right.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.120
I can't really argue with that.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.080
I'm trying to think if I could poke any holes in it.

16:13.080 --> 16:17.060
Well, my hole that I've got to poke in it is what if it's just a machine that's tucked

16:17.060 --> 16:19.360
off in the corner that hardly ever gets used?

16:19.360 --> 16:24.120
Surely it has to be either your ThinkPad or your main workstation or one of the RBS machine

16:24.120 --> 16:25.120
or something like that.

16:25.120 --> 16:29.200
And it can't just be like for a couple of weeks, even if it's like three weeks for a

16:29.200 --> 16:31.200
review and then I switch off of it.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.000
No, it's got to be you using it personally to get work done.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Yeah.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
Okay.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
All right.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.620
So I don't think I can poke any holes in that.

16:40.620 --> 16:43.000
Do you want to restate it in the final summary?

16:43.000 --> 16:49.240
I predict that in 2019, Chris is using the Gnome desktop on at least one production machine

16:49.240 --> 16:51.360
for 60 days or longer.

16:51.360 --> 16:52.560
All right.

16:52.560 --> 16:53.780
Prediction locked in there.

16:53.780 --> 16:58.040
And I think I think that has a high chance of success.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.040
It's funny.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.040
All right.

17:00.040 --> 17:01.040
Mumble room.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.000
If anybody wants to jump in with a prediction, go ahead.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
I have one.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.040
All right, Popey, go ahead.

17:06.040 --> 17:15.400
In 2019, Apple will announce and ship a non x86 based MacBook line of computers.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.400
All right.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.400
Okay.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.240
Meaning specifically ARM.

17:19.240 --> 17:20.240
Yeah.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.720
Their ARM, their own ARM sauce.

17:21.720 --> 17:25.000
Well, not RISC-V. Come on.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.640
I was going to leave the door open for RISC-V, but then I thought, no, that's just ludicrous.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.380
So you think so, huh?

17:30.380 --> 17:31.960
And how would you see that?

17:31.960 --> 17:35.520
Would you see that as more like the bottom of the consumer line?

17:35.520 --> 17:38.240
Or do you see that as like the Mac Pro that's supposedly going to ship?

17:38.240 --> 17:39.240
I see it.

17:39.240 --> 17:40.240
I see it.

17:40.240 --> 17:43.820
The new MacBook Air that has amazing battery life.

17:43.820 --> 17:48.420
And we've taken everything we've learned from making amazing ARM processors in phones and

17:48.420 --> 17:54.600
tablets over all the years, and we baked that into this device that is lightweight, silent

17:54.600 --> 17:56.600
and long battery life.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.640
All those kind of things that people ask for from a MacBook Air and it will have all the

18:00.640 --> 18:03.200
usual display and the connectivity and all that kind of stuff.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.200
It's still running OS X.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.200
Yes.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.200
It'll run OS X.

18:06.200 --> 18:10.400
But the key thing that relates it to Linux is it will make it much harder for us to run

18:10.400 --> 18:11.400
Linux on that device.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.400
Yeah.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.400
Sorry.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.400
If I'm being the referee here, I have to correct you.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.400
It's Mac OS, not OS X.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.400
You're right.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.400
You're right.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.400
Thank you.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.400
Thank you, referee.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.400
You're right.

18:20.400 --> 18:21.400
You're right.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.400
Yeah.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.400
Yeah.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.400
That's what I was wondering is how compatible will these be with Linux?

18:24.400 --> 18:27.800
And I'll tell you, we already have some insights, and it is not very.

18:27.800 --> 18:32.580
Because the T2 chip, everybody's been talking about with the Mac Mini and the other devices,

18:32.580 --> 18:37.720
the drives simply do not show up for Linux because Linux has no software support in any

18:37.720 --> 18:40.560
regards for that SATA controller.

18:40.560 --> 18:46.160
The T2 chip that controls touch ID or the touch bar if your Mac has one is also the

18:46.160 --> 18:51.580
SATA controller for those MVD drives that are in the MacBook Pro.

18:51.580 --> 18:52.880
And Linux has no drivers.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.300
And Apple will not be writing any drivers for Linux.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.720
Why would they?

18:56.720 --> 19:02.120
And if Popeye's prediction is to come true, it is the expansion of this T2 platform.

19:02.120 --> 19:07.000
Sometimes they'll call it the T3 platform or something like that, that will consume

19:07.000 --> 19:08.760
and replace the Intel chip.

19:08.760 --> 19:14.060
They'll just grow the existing ARM board that's already based on one of their A series processors

19:14.060 --> 19:18.080
running an isolated version of iOS with a secure enclave.

19:18.080 --> 19:21.840
They'll just grow that out to be a larger motherboard or a logic board, as they call

19:21.840 --> 19:22.840
it.

19:22.840 --> 19:27.200
And it could even ship with a low end Intel mobile processor that could be spun up on

19:27.200 --> 19:29.400
demand to run applications in compatibility mode.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.400
Absolutely, right?

19:30.400 --> 19:31.400
It could be.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.400
It could be ideological.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.920
They just want, they have their own design goals and they're going to use whatever tech

19:34.920 --> 19:35.920
they can to meet them.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.760
I don't think the board even needs to be that much bigger to go in a laptop.

19:38.760 --> 19:44.520
I mean, if you look at the size of MacBook Air logic boards, they're pretty tiny.

19:44.520 --> 19:48.480
And there's the associated circuitry for charging and the IO and stuff like that.

19:48.480 --> 19:55.960
But there's not actually a lot different between an iPhone and an iPad and a laptop in Apple's

19:55.960 --> 19:59.800
eyes internally other than a giant battery and a massive screen.

19:59.800 --> 20:00.800
Yeah.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.960
I don't mean in size, I mean in functionality.

20:02.960 --> 20:07.400
And I think you could achieve it with something that is comparable to what the iPad Pro does

20:07.400 --> 20:08.400
today.

20:08.400 --> 20:09.400
Yeah, exactly.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.960
I think we need a bonus point here for what it's going to be called.

20:11.960 --> 20:15.040
So let's all speculate on what this new product is going to be called.

20:15.040 --> 20:20.440
I'm going to predict the MacBook Helium.

20:20.440 --> 20:24.600
I think to make it normalized, they'll just call it the new MacBook Air.

20:24.600 --> 20:25.600
Yeah.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.800
I think it will just be a continuation of the MacBook Air line.

20:27.800 --> 20:28.800
Yeah.

20:28.800 --> 20:29.800
Hmm.

20:29.800 --> 20:30.800
That's terrific.

20:30.800 --> 20:35.320
But the ambiguity there is whether or not it's going to have an x86 chip as well that

20:35.320 --> 20:37.800
will be secondary, like the ARM chip secondary now.

20:37.800 --> 20:41.040
Popi, are you saying it's going to be pure ARM with no x86?

20:41.040 --> 20:43.440
Yes, pure ARM, no x86.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.800
It will be a non x86 laptop.

20:46.800 --> 20:47.800
Right.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.280
So you need to lock that in then.

20:49.280 --> 20:52.480
Let's have it in a nice editable chunk.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.480
Very succinct.

20:53.480 --> 20:59.800
In 2019, Apple will announce and launch a line of laptops called MacBook Air, which

20:59.800 --> 21:05.400
will feature ARM-based processors and no x86 processors.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.400
Prediction locked.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.400
There we go.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.400
We're doing great, guys.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.400
Excellent.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.400
Thank you for your contribution.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.400
That was a good one.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.640
Yeah, because I could totally see that happening.

21:12.640 --> 21:15.360
Before the iPad Pro with lightning, maybe not.

21:15.360 --> 21:18.960
But now with the iPad Pro that has USB-C, I feel like I could see that.

21:18.960 --> 21:19.960
All right.

21:19.960 --> 21:20.960
You ready for my next prediction?

21:20.960 --> 21:21.960
All right.

21:21.960 --> 21:26.640
My next one that I'm not as confident, I kind of go up in confidence as I go, but my next

21:26.640 --> 21:33.600
one is Clear Linux has a great 2019 by just about anyone's measure.

21:33.600 --> 21:39.400
It will see specifically more press coverage and more coverage of using Clear Linux as

21:39.400 --> 21:41.040
a desktop operating system.

21:41.040 --> 21:44.200
Now, obviously, you covered it on one of your shows, it doesn't count.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.200
Really?

21:45.200 --> 21:46.200
Okay, fair.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.200
All right.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.680
Excluding Jupyter Broadcasting's coverage.

21:48.680 --> 21:55.000
Can exclude Ferronix's coverage as well.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
Here's the thing.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.860
It's really kind of a bet on the fact that Ike is back in there and that they're starting

21:58.860 --> 22:05.200
to talk about it more and they're sort of solidifying their open source software group

22:05.200 --> 22:06.840
and getting them out there talking more.

22:06.840 --> 22:13.480
I feel like Intel is trying to make a play to keep relevance in the data center while

22:13.480 --> 22:18.160
they're still relevant and Clear Linux is a key part of that strategy.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.160
Right.

22:19.160 --> 22:23.080
So referee time again, although I do agree with you that it is going to be a great year,

22:23.080 --> 22:27.040
we're going to be talking about Clear Linux a lot more, but that's not measurable.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.240
We need some quantifiable thing.

22:29.240 --> 22:31.760
I don't know how you could come up with it.

22:31.760 --> 22:35.880
Is it a number of articles or is it being featured on a certain website?

22:35.880 --> 22:37.400
How high it is on DistroWatch?

22:37.400 --> 22:40.400
No, no, that's never going to be it.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.440
There's a good random chance it'll just happen.

22:42.440 --> 22:45.320
Yeah, that's never going to be it.

22:45.320 --> 22:52.040
I was thinking articles, but I don't know, again, how to exactly measure that other than

22:52.040 --> 22:57.080
we have a sense of how much things get covered because we watch it on a day-to-day basis.

22:57.080 --> 23:02.280
But I don't really, I don't have like a spreadsheet where every time I see a Clear Linux story,

23:02.280 --> 23:04.320
I tick another number in the column.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.200
So I'm not quite sure how to measure that one.

23:06.200 --> 23:09.360
Well, don't make me throw this out then.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.440
I mean, it could be throwable.

23:11.440 --> 23:12.440
It could be.

23:12.440 --> 23:15.440
Like Wes, can you think of a way we could measure it?

23:15.440 --> 23:19.320
What about like an article?

23:19.320 --> 23:24.040
See the thing is anything I say could influence that blogger not to do it.

23:24.040 --> 23:27.960
You know, like if I say so-and-so will write a post about setting up Clear Linux as the

23:27.960 --> 23:32.760
ultimate desktop, they may not do it just out of spite because I said it on this show

23:32.760 --> 23:33.760
because they're bastards like that.

23:33.760 --> 23:38.560
I mean, you could just set like a certain number of articles from a, you know, we can

23:38.560 --> 23:42.520
blacklist some sources, Foronix or whatever you have for Foronix.

23:42.520 --> 23:48.240
I think the very, the specificness of Foronix needs to be mentioned just because they're

23:48.240 --> 23:55.240
a very pro Intel mouthpiece, if you like, and will post about Clear Linux at the drop

23:55.240 --> 23:56.240
of a hat.

23:56.240 --> 23:57.240
Okay.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.240
How about this?

23:58.240 --> 24:04.320
Five articles about Clear Linux in the server space and the desktop space that are not Foronix

24:04.320 --> 24:05.600
and not on this show.

24:05.600 --> 24:06.600
Good?

24:06.600 --> 24:07.600
Are we good with that?

24:07.600 --> 24:13.560
I think that seems to me a little bit too low, really, because if you looked at how

24:13.560 --> 24:16.560
many articles there were over the last year, it's got to be more than five.

24:16.560 --> 24:17.560
You think so?

24:17.560 --> 24:18.560
Okay.

24:18.560 --> 24:19.560
Now you could say something of a certain caliber, right?

24:19.560 --> 24:24.640
Like if it was like an R's or something of a, you know, like a mainstream article, more

24:24.640 --> 24:25.640
so than a Linux world article.

24:25.640 --> 24:28.120
Yeah, like five on Ars Technica, that would do it.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.120
That's not going to happen, though.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.120
That's not going to happen.

24:30.120 --> 24:31.120
Well, yeah.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.120
Voodoo doesn't even get five on Ars Technica.

24:32.120 --> 24:33.120
They might get five.

24:33.120 --> 24:36.120
Barely, they might get five.

24:36.120 --> 24:42.040
I mean, okay, how about 50, 50 across the industry that's not Foronix and not Linux

24:42.040 --> 24:43.040
unplugged?

24:43.040 --> 24:46.360
Yeah, that's going to be pretty hard to try and count up, though, isn't it?

24:46.360 --> 24:49.560
It's going to be easier if you just say three on Ars or something.

24:49.560 --> 24:50.560
Yeah, I know.

24:50.560 --> 24:52.520
I'm, what can I say, I'm bullish.

24:52.520 --> 24:56.200
I'm bullish on Intel, I'm bullish on Clear Linux.

24:56.200 --> 25:00.640
I think people are, a lot of people on Linux are looking for specific types of optimized

25:00.640 --> 25:04.200
performance and they have workloads where they need to eek every bit of performance

25:04.200 --> 25:06.840
out of a machine that's sitting in their rack.

25:06.840 --> 25:10.960
And when you've got the manufacturer of a CPU that's making a Linux distribution where

25:10.960 --> 25:15.160
they say they're building every bit of software in the entire stack optimized for their processors,

25:15.160 --> 25:17.040
that might sell.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.440
We could make a little like a Slack channel or something.

25:19.440 --> 25:22.320
Every article we see about it, we just post it in there and go back next year.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.000
I'm going to have to start keeping track after this.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.760
This is one of those predictions that's going to make it years worth of work.

25:26.760 --> 25:27.760
You need work for yourself.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.760
Damn it.

25:28.760 --> 25:31.960
Yeah, I'm not counting this up, so it's on you.

25:31.960 --> 25:32.960
All right.

25:32.960 --> 25:33.960
All right, I'll keep track.

25:33.960 --> 25:34.960
Are we good with 50?

25:34.960 --> 25:35.960
Are we good with 50?

25:35.960 --> 25:36.960
What do you say?

25:36.960 --> 25:37.960
Yeah.

25:37.960 --> 25:38.960
All right.

25:38.960 --> 25:42.720
And I'm going for, I'm going for articles that are talking about using Clear Linux or

25:42.720 --> 25:46.060
talking about using it for the desktop or talking about why it's great for containers

25:46.060 --> 25:49.840
or great for machine learning, like articles that are very, you know, like, hey, check

25:49.840 --> 25:53.520
out this up and coming distro that you don't know about that we've all been talking about

25:53.520 --> 25:54.520
for years now.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.640
Do they count if it's a huge vulnerability in it?

25:56.640 --> 25:57.640
Yes.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.640
Yeah.

25:58.640 --> 26:02.640
If it, because if it gets coverage, that means it's of an industry importance that

26:02.640 --> 26:03.640
it gets mentioned.

26:03.640 --> 26:04.640
Yeah.

26:04.640 --> 26:05.640
All right.

26:05.640 --> 26:06.640
I think you better lock it in then.

26:06.640 --> 26:07.640
All right.

26:07.640 --> 26:12.600
So in summary, 2019, we'll see 50 publications about Clear Linux.

26:12.600 --> 26:18.520
The Clear Linux hype will grow, excluding articles from Ferronics and coverage from

26:18.520 --> 26:21.440
Linux Unplugged.

26:21.440 --> 26:22.440
Prediction locked.

26:22.440 --> 26:23.440
Nicely done.

26:23.440 --> 26:25.840
You guys made me work for that one.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.160
That's what the rules are about.

26:27.160 --> 26:28.160
All right, Wes.

26:28.160 --> 26:29.160
All right, Wes.

26:29.160 --> 26:33.800
Well, so we'll go to the mumble room after you, but I want to get one more of yours on

26:33.800 --> 26:34.800
the record.

26:34.800 --> 26:35.800
Wes Payne.

26:35.800 --> 26:36.800
Okay.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.720
So this one will need to, we'll need some help cleaning up as well.

26:38.720 --> 26:46.280
In 2019, Red Hat drops either just explicitly or by key people leaving support for one major

26:46.280 --> 26:48.600
component of the free desktop.

26:48.600 --> 26:49.600
Wow.

26:49.600 --> 26:52.720
I think we need some examples of the components here.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.160
And that's where, yeah, that's where we need some help cleaning it up.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.160
Okay.

26:56.160 --> 27:02.600
So basically, you're thinking of major components like PulseAudio or Bolt or Network Manager

27:02.600 --> 27:05.060
or something in the Gnome stack.

27:05.060 --> 27:09.600
Something that, you know, we would be like, oh, boy, I got to tell you, that makes me

27:09.600 --> 27:11.920
very uncomfortable when you say that.

27:11.920 --> 27:12.920
Yeah, I'm not happy you say that.

27:12.920 --> 27:13.920
I don't know.

27:13.920 --> 27:17.760
I'm just, if it happens, I want, I want to, I want credit.

27:17.760 --> 27:18.760
Oh, okay.

27:18.760 --> 27:19.760
All right.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.080
So what do you think, Ref?

27:21.080 --> 27:23.920
How specific does Wes need to get in this?

27:23.920 --> 27:28.640
Because this is one of those where there's a lot of room even for a project just to be

27:28.640 --> 27:31.400
end of life because it's the end of the project.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.280
Yeah, I think this is a little bit too vague.

27:33.280 --> 27:39.000
I think you're going to have to look it down to, I don't know, maybe pick five or six actual

27:39.000 --> 27:42.640
examples of it and say that one of those is going to go away because it's just too many

27:42.640 --> 27:43.640
aspects here.

27:43.640 --> 27:44.640
Like a range of five projects.

27:44.640 --> 27:45.640
Yeah, okay.

27:45.640 --> 27:46.640
Well, let's, let's.

27:46.640 --> 27:47.640
Yeah, okay.

27:47.640 --> 27:50.440
So I mean, oh, that's tough because like you could say system D, but then there's so many

27:50.440 --> 27:55.340
things like underneath system D that could technically qualify.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.760
There's also aspects of Wayland to consider.

27:57.760 --> 27:58.760
Yeah.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.680
And what happens if they drop Pulse in favor of PipeWire, for example?

28:01.680 --> 28:06.700
Well, and this, you know, really when you zoom out, this is why the IBM purchasing Red

28:06.700 --> 28:14.200
Hat news was so big specifically for us and our audience because there's so many projects

28:14.200 --> 28:20.360
that Red Hat does manage as part of a comprehensive desktop support that we don't really talk

28:20.360 --> 28:21.840
about very often.

28:21.840 --> 28:27.040
There's a lot of free desktop components that are just maintained by Red Hat for years now

28:27.040 --> 28:31.100
that we just all rely upon and don't really think about.

28:31.100 --> 28:34.080
And so when you start talking about some of those going away, what you're talking about

28:34.080 --> 28:38.960
is one of the pillars of the Linux desktop going away or transitioning away.

28:38.960 --> 28:41.640
And that makes me really uncomfortable.

28:41.640 --> 28:42.640
You're squirming over there.

28:42.640 --> 28:43.640
I am.

28:43.640 --> 28:44.640
I just want my stuff to work.

28:44.640 --> 28:45.640
Okay.

28:45.640 --> 28:46.640
So yeah.

28:46.640 --> 28:47.640
Network manager.

28:47.640 --> 28:48.640
Let's do PipeWire.

28:48.640 --> 28:49.640
Sure.

28:49.640 --> 28:50.640
That's three at us.

28:50.640 --> 28:51.640
We could say that.

28:51.640 --> 28:52.640
That's three.

28:52.640 --> 28:53.640
Okay.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.640
What else?

28:54.640 --> 28:55.640
Bolt, you said?

28:55.640 --> 28:56.640
Yeah.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.640
That's kind of small.

28:57.640 --> 28:58.640
You also, yeah.

28:58.640 --> 29:02.600
It feels like Bolt and FWFD and the LVFS stuff has like no chance of going away.

29:02.600 --> 29:05.600
Like that stuff's more important than ever right now.

29:05.600 --> 29:06.600
That's relevant on the server.

29:06.600 --> 29:07.600
Yeah.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.760
Really desktop focused things is really what I'm thinking.

29:09.760 --> 29:10.760
Okay.

29:10.760 --> 29:11.760
Okay, Ref.

29:11.760 --> 29:12.760
Okay.

29:12.760 --> 29:15.520
I got a suggestion, but it's not exactly what he's going for.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.720
What about punting GTK4 for another year?

29:18.720 --> 29:21.160
Is that, does that qualify?

29:21.160 --> 29:22.160
Hmm.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.160
Possibly.

29:23.160 --> 29:24.160
Yeah.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.160
Possibly.

29:25.160 --> 29:26.160
That seems reasonable.

29:26.160 --> 29:30.480
So, so that could be your last one is they, you know, nothing happens in that department

29:30.480 --> 29:32.220
for another year.

29:32.220 --> 29:33.960
What about tying in with your other one?

29:33.960 --> 29:36.800
Kind of hedging your bets and saying that they completely dropped GNOME.

29:36.800 --> 29:41.600
I don't, I feel like, I feel like that has a momentum on GNOME is better than ever right

29:41.600 --> 29:42.600
now.

29:42.600 --> 29:43.600
Yeah.

29:43.600 --> 29:45.920
So I feel like it's got a better shot than ever right now.

29:45.920 --> 29:46.920
I don't know.

29:46.920 --> 29:49.520
Yeah, so all right, you got to come up with a five, you got to come up with all five.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.460
So we've got, what do we have so far?

29:51.460 --> 29:53.480
We've got Network Manager.

29:53.480 --> 29:54.480
We've got PipeWire.

29:54.480 --> 29:55.480
Yep.

29:55.480 --> 29:56.480
We've got Stratus.

29:56.480 --> 29:57.480
Yep.

29:57.480 --> 30:00.840
We've got, I don't know about Bolt, but that's the fourth one.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.880
And then the fifth one is GTK4 doesn't ship.

30:02.880 --> 30:03.880
Okay.

30:03.880 --> 30:04.880
Okay.

30:04.880 --> 30:05.880
So you ready to lock it in then Wes?

30:05.880 --> 30:06.880
All right.

30:06.880 --> 30:11.560
I predict in 2019 Red Hat drops support either just explicitly or key people leave for one

30:11.560 --> 30:18.640
of these projects, Network Manager, PipeWire, Stratus, Bolt, or they just sort of delay

30:18.640 --> 30:20.080
any work on GTK4.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.080
It just doesn't ship.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.080
In 2019.

30:22.080 --> 30:23.080
In 2019.

30:23.080 --> 30:24.080
That's one of those things.

30:24.080 --> 30:25.080
I'm going to lock it.

30:25.080 --> 30:26.080
All righty.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.080
I'm not happy to say it.

30:27.080 --> 30:28.080
Okay.

30:28.080 --> 30:29.080
It's locked in.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.080
Whew, that was rough.

30:30.080 --> 30:31.080
That was rough.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.200
Mumble Room, you got one that we can shift gears to?

30:33.200 --> 30:34.200
Anybody else have a prediction?

30:34.200 --> 30:35.200
Something happier.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.200
I've got one.

30:36.200 --> 30:44.640
Sometime in 2019, a major piece of enterprise software will be ported to Ubuntu 18.04, such

30:44.640 --> 30:49.520
as SAP or Active Directory.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.320
Active Directory for Linux.

30:51.320 --> 30:53.800
That would be massive.

30:53.800 --> 31:01.640
Microsoft SQL Server is available on Linux now, so if it is ported to 18.04, there is

31:01.640 --> 31:06.720
a 50-50 chance it will be distributed as a SNAP.

31:06.720 --> 31:07.720
Whoa.

31:07.720 --> 31:09.720
Going for a bonus point there.

31:09.720 --> 31:10.720
What do you say, ref?

31:10.720 --> 31:11.720
Is this allowed?

31:11.720 --> 31:12.720
Yeah.

31:12.720 --> 31:14.800
Well, I was going to say the SNAP thing.

31:14.800 --> 31:18.520
Poppy, you can probably tell us whether this is going to come true or not already.

31:18.520 --> 31:21.280
But I guess your lips are sealed on this one.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.320
Yeah, that would have to be in the works.

31:23.320 --> 31:24.320
Keep it clean.

31:24.320 --> 31:25.320
Keep it clean.

31:25.320 --> 31:26.320
Suddenly, Mumble's not working for him.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.320
Oh, weird.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.320
Strange.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.320
He's having connection issues.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.320
He can't comment on it.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.320
Oh, no.

31:31.320 --> 31:32.320
Nothing.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.320
We're just kidding.

31:33.320 --> 31:34.320
It's fine.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.320
But yeah, that's a pretty good one.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.320
I got to say.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.320
All right.

31:37.320 --> 31:42.800
As someone who used to work on SAP, that's a super interesting one to pick.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.320
If you're going to explicitly put that in your prediction, that's an interesting one

31:45.320 --> 31:46.320
to pick.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.320
But you're not.

31:47.320 --> 31:51.360
And you're just talking about something of the size or the order of magnitude of SAP.

31:51.360 --> 31:55.240
I'm just using SAP as an example because that's a really big piece of enterprise software

31:55.240 --> 32:00.160
I'm using as an example because that's the kind of scale that I'm talking about of large

32:00.160 --> 32:01.480
enterprise applications.

32:01.480 --> 32:02.480
I don't know.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.480
I think maybe you ought to name a couple.

32:04.480 --> 32:06.520
I think you should go on the record.

32:06.520 --> 32:07.520
What do you think, Ref?

32:07.520 --> 32:08.520
Yeah, I think so.

32:08.520 --> 32:11.000
I think we're going to have to have some names of applications here.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.360
I think SAP is a good one.

32:12.360 --> 32:15.800
I think SAP, Active Directory, I think those are good ones.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.840
I think great.

32:17.840 --> 32:18.840
Not necessarily SAP.

32:18.840 --> 32:22.600
SAP is pretty vague because there's multiple applications.

32:22.600 --> 32:26.200
I think a good benchmark would be SAP HANA.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.200
All right.

32:27.200 --> 32:28.200
So what do you say, Sean?

32:28.200 --> 32:29.760
Can you summarize that up to lock it in?

32:29.760 --> 32:38.360
I predict at some point in 2019, a major piece of enterprise software such as SAP for HANA

32:38.360 --> 32:44.680
or Active Directory will be imported to Ubuntu 18.04.

32:44.680 --> 32:53.040
And if such a thing is done, I predict a 50% chance that it will be distributed as a snap.

32:53.040 --> 32:54.040
I like that.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.040
That is locked in.

32:55.040 --> 32:56.040
That's a good one.

32:56.040 --> 33:00.960
You know, I was trying to think of some enterprise ones specifically because a lot of times on

33:00.960 --> 33:02.540
this show, we focus on the desktop.

33:02.540 --> 33:04.460
But no one's joking.

33:04.460 --> 33:08.840
We all understand the enterprise is way, way, way bigger for Linux.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.920
And we should be talking more about it than we do.

33:10.920 --> 33:12.720
But it's more fun to talk about it.

33:12.720 --> 33:13.720
That's right.

33:13.720 --> 33:19.160
I predict that in 2019, all virtualized guests will be utilizing encrypted memory.

33:19.160 --> 33:22.000
Oh, that'd be nice to see.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.200
But quite the performance hit.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.240
Do you think people really want to do that at scale?

33:25.240 --> 33:26.240
I think so.

33:26.240 --> 33:27.240
Oh, absolutely.

33:27.240 --> 33:33.600
I think that what they're going to do is integrate hardware solutions as part of that encryption.

33:33.600 --> 33:34.600
What do you think, Wes?

33:34.600 --> 33:35.600
Could you see that?

33:35.600 --> 33:36.960
It could be a feature for sure.

33:36.960 --> 33:39.920
Like the premier cloud providers roll it out first.

33:39.920 --> 33:43.000
I mean, yeah, I guess it's the percentage, right?

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
That's the question.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.960
I could definitely see it increasing and would like to.

33:45.960 --> 33:46.960
Yeah, yeah.

33:46.960 --> 33:47.960
That's a good point.

33:47.960 --> 33:51.160
How much of a market domination are you talking about here?

33:51.160 --> 33:52.160
That's a good question.

33:52.160 --> 33:56.040
I'm going to say at least a 15% to 20% adoption.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.800
I would go more, but I want to be conservative.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.360
What do you think, Ref?

33:59.360 --> 34:02.080
Is that enough to really say it's a clear win or not?

34:02.080 --> 34:05.000
Well, I think that if you're going to put a percentage on it, then that's something

34:05.000 --> 34:06.000
we can measure.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
So that's fair enough.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.000
Okay.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.000
All right.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
All right.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Ref says it's good.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
All right.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
All right.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
I guess we lock it in.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
All right.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
All right.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
All right.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Go ahead.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.000
Sum it up, Drifter, and lock it in.

34:19.000 --> 34:24.360
Fuchsia enterprise virtualization will utilize encrypted memory.

34:24.360 --> 34:25.360
That's a good one.

34:25.360 --> 34:26.360
That's a really, really good one.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.320
A couple of good enterprise ones there.

34:28.320 --> 34:29.320
Nice one.

34:29.320 --> 34:30.600
I hope that one does come true.

34:30.600 --> 34:33.480
I think out of all the ones we've done, the one that I hope for the most is that.

34:33.480 --> 34:34.480
Yep.

34:34.480 --> 34:35.480
All right.

34:35.480 --> 34:36.480
Is it my turn?

34:36.480 --> 34:37.480
I think it is.

34:37.480 --> 34:42.440
This one I get a little nervous about, and I'm almost positive it's going to happen.

34:42.440 --> 34:47.320
Fuchsia app development will begin in 2019, taking advantage of existing Android tools

34:47.320 --> 34:52.440
such as Android Studio and the Android emulator to build software for Fuchsia that runs on

34:52.440 --> 34:54.680
Android and Fuchsia at the same time.

34:54.680 --> 34:55.960
Isn't that already happening?

34:55.960 --> 34:56.960
Is it?

34:56.960 --> 34:57.960
I don't know if it is.

34:57.960 --> 35:01.760
I know that I follow the news very closely, and there's indications that it may be in

35:01.760 --> 35:06.600
the works, and that certain components are showing up in repositories, but I don't know

35:06.600 --> 35:08.240
that it's actually going to happen.

35:08.240 --> 35:12.080
Those repositories, as we record right now, are empty.

35:12.080 --> 35:17.160
So are you talking about internal to Google, or are you going to go out and say external

35:17.160 --> 35:18.160
app developers?

35:18.160 --> 35:22.720
I don't know if it's like a Google I.O. level announcement or if it's a smaller soft launch

35:22.720 --> 35:29.420
style thing, but I'm saying if you have Android Studio, by the end of 2019 you can start building

35:29.420 --> 35:30.420
Fuchsia applications.

35:30.420 --> 35:34.880
Well, yeah, people will be able to do that, but are you predicting that people will be

35:34.880 --> 35:37.160
doing it or just that the ability will be there?

35:37.160 --> 35:38.720
Oh, absolutely both.

35:38.720 --> 35:39.720
Absolutely both.

35:39.720 --> 35:40.720
Yeah.

35:40.720 --> 35:45.240
I mean, you just take it as a given, but there's really nothing locked in at this point that

35:45.240 --> 35:47.360
any of this happens in 2019.

35:47.360 --> 35:51.720
Google could take another year to soft build this thing and experiment with more devices,

35:51.720 --> 35:55.360
and they could maybe announce it in 2020 for all we know.

35:55.360 --> 35:56.360
There's really no...

35:56.360 --> 35:59.520
I mean, so this is one of these things about these predictions.

35:59.520 --> 36:03.640
When we sit at this point in the year, we have a recency bias, and we think things are

36:03.640 --> 36:06.760
a bigger deal than the things at the beginning of the year.

36:06.760 --> 36:12.700
And I point to how excited we all got, me specifically, about Bitcoin last year, right?

36:12.700 --> 36:15.880
Because Bitcoin just seemed like a foregone conclusion at the end of last year that it

36:15.880 --> 36:17.040
was going to be huge.

36:17.040 --> 36:22.780
And now, as we record, it's at $3,806.93, not that I'm keeping track.

36:22.780 --> 36:27.760
And it really was a huge flop, but we would have taken it as a given at the end of last

36:27.760 --> 36:28.760
year.

36:28.760 --> 36:33.100
So I'm not so sure Fuchsia is necessarily a given when you take the whole year in context,

36:33.100 --> 36:36.600
but I'm going on a limb and I'm saying, a limb, a limb, what is it, a ledge?

36:36.600 --> 36:37.600
Out on a limb.

36:37.600 --> 36:38.600
Limb.

36:38.600 --> 36:39.600
Thank you.

36:39.600 --> 36:40.600
I'm going out on the limb.

36:40.600 --> 36:41.600
What?

36:41.600 --> 36:42.600
No.

36:42.600 --> 36:43.600
It's a lunar module.

36:43.600 --> 36:44.600
Never mind.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.840
I'm going out on the limb, not the ledge.

36:47.840 --> 36:51.040
I'm taking a risk here.

36:51.040 --> 36:56.280
And I'm going to say that developers will be creating Fuchsia applications and running

36:56.280 --> 37:00.280
them in emulators and getting ready to ship them on Fuchsia devices.

37:00.280 --> 37:02.280
How do we measure that?

37:02.280 --> 37:05.760
Well, we'll start seeing Fuchsia applications show up.

37:05.760 --> 37:06.760
We'll start seeing-

37:06.760 --> 37:07.760
How many?

37:07.760 --> 37:09.960
Well, so first of all, Google will have to make an announcement that it's go time, right?

37:09.960 --> 37:11.840
So that'll be a clear indicator, I think.

37:11.840 --> 37:17.360
Do you think this will show up in a beta of Android Studio in 2019 or a final release

37:17.360 --> 37:20.000
in 2019?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Maybe just the next release.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Like a supported release.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Yeah.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Right.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Just really soon.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.000
Yeah, like really soon.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.000
Like maybe not the next release, but the release after that.

37:27.000 --> 37:31.440
I think the first way it'll show up is you'll have the Fuchsia emulator, which will be like

37:31.440 --> 37:36.720
a generic Google device that runs Fuchsia that you can run your application on to make

37:36.720 --> 37:40.240
sure that if you're writing an Android application that's going to run on Fuchsia that everything's

37:40.240 --> 37:41.240
solid.

37:41.240 --> 37:42.320
That's how it first rolls out.

37:42.320 --> 37:44.920
And that'll be, I would think around Google IO, but who knows?

37:44.920 --> 37:45.920
Okay.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.200
So we need to be specific here.

37:48.200 --> 37:54.560
Are you going to say a third party developer will release an app for Fuchsia?

37:54.560 --> 37:58.400
And if so, are you going to go so far as to say what that might be or who it might be?

37:58.400 --> 38:01.800
Are you going to say like Facebook Messenger or something like that maybe?

38:01.800 --> 38:03.360
Here's the problem.

38:03.360 --> 38:06.480
I'm not saying Fuchsia devices are shipping in 2019.

38:06.480 --> 38:07.700
I'm not saying that.

38:07.700 --> 38:10.840
So there may be zero reason, really.

38:10.840 --> 38:14.520
There may be no reason for a developer to ship this Fuchsia application if there's no

38:14.520 --> 38:15.520
device.

38:15.520 --> 38:18.960
But what you'll be able to start doing is making sure that the Android applications

38:18.960 --> 38:20.920
you're building run okay on Fuchsia.

38:20.920 --> 38:24.840
Just like you can run Android applications on some Chromebooks right now, you'll be able

38:24.840 --> 38:28.840
to run Android applications on Fuchsia devices.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.360
And that's what developers will be testing.

38:31.360 --> 38:34.400
Now how do I lock that in?

38:34.400 --> 38:37.000
Because you know the first application is going to be a fart app.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
I hope so.

38:38.000 --> 38:43.080
That would be such a great bonus prediction.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.800
Somebody in the audience, please make that happen.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.520
That would be so great.

38:46.520 --> 38:51.040
Okay, here's what I'm thinking I could lock in is Google will announce that you can start

38:51.040 --> 38:54.040
testing Android devices in the Fuchsia emulator.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.040
Yeah.

38:55.040 --> 38:56.040
Is that fair?

38:56.040 --> 38:58.520
That seems like definitely going to happen.

38:58.520 --> 39:01.320
And that is testable and measurable.

39:01.320 --> 39:03.480
So yeah, I think you could lock that in if you wanted to.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.200
But you're definitely going to win.

39:05.200 --> 39:06.200
Really?

39:06.200 --> 39:07.200
You think so?

39:07.200 --> 39:08.200
There's a recency bias.

39:08.200 --> 39:10.280
See, again, I go back to the Bitcoin thing.

39:10.280 --> 39:12.320
Like it seems like a definite now.

39:12.320 --> 39:14.400
But a lot can happen in a year.

39:14.400 --> 39:19.680
And this could never really come to fruition like it just might not happen.

39:19.680 --> 39:20.680
You seem skeptical.

39:20.680 --> 39:22.000
I mean, it seems like they're kind of bullish on it.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.000
But you're right.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.420
There is a recency bias.

39:25.420 --> 39:26.420
It's ready.

39:26.420 --> 39:27.420
It's here.

39:27.420 --> 39:28.420
I guess lock it in.

39:28.420 --> 39:29.420
All right.

39:29.420 --> 39:30.420
Okay, here we go.

39:30.420 --> 39:31.420
To lock it in.

39:31.420 --> 39:36.560
In 2019, Google announced that you can start testing your Android applications on Fuchsia

39:36.560 --> 39:40.280
using their handy generic emulator.

39:40.280 --> 39:44.800
And I don't know what that means for Android and then eventually Google's long term commitments

39:44.800 --> 39:46.720
and contributions to the Linux kernel.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.080
I don't know what that means.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.080
We'll see.

39:49.080 --> 39:50.080
I guess we just wait and see.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.080
All right, Mr. Payne.

39:51.080 --> 39:52.560
How are you feeling about your next one?

39:52.560 --> 39:53.560
Yeah.

39:53.560 --> 39:54.560
Yeah.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.560
All right, let's go.

39:55.560 --> 39:59.320
I'm going to say that in 2019, BcashFS is mainlined.

39:59.320 --> 40:02.200
Oh, that's a good one.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.600
That's easily measurable, too.

40:03.600 --> 40:04.600
Don't you think, Rev?

40:04.600 --> 40:05.600
That's pretty clear.

40:05.600 --> 40:11.920
Well, mainlined in a kernel that we can actually use, or is it going to be in an RC or what?

40:11.920 --> 40:16.720
Yeah, I'm going to say it's going to be in Linus's tree.

40:16.720 --> 40:21.880
Okay, Linus's tree, but will it be like in a Ubuntu or like a Fedora?

40:21.880 --> 40:23.800
Is it going to be in a distro or are you just saying-

40:23.800 --> 40:24.800
I don't know.

40:24.800 --> 40:25.800
I think it'll be in Linus's tree.

40:25.800 --> 40:26.800
I don't know about the distro part.

40:26.800 --> 40:27.800
Okay.

40:27.800 --> 40:28.800
Will it at least be an arch?

40:28.800 --> 40:29.800
Yeah.

40:29.800 --> 40:30.800
Yeah, it'll be an arch.

40:30.800 --> 40:31.800
Okay, sure.

40:31.800 --> 40:32.800
It already is.

40:32.800 --> 40:33.800
That's pretty good.

40:33.800 --> 40:36.200
I really can't argue with pretty much any of that.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.320
I think you could sum it up and lock it in.

40:38.320 --> 40:39.320
Rev, it's your call.

40:39.320 --> 40:40.320
I think that's pretty good, though.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.720
Yeah, I think that, yeah, lock it in.

40:42.720 --> 40:51.320
In 2019, BcashFS will enter the mainline kernel and be shipped in a distribution like Arch.

40:51.320 --> 40:52.880
I really hope that comes to fruition.

40:52.880 --> 40:55.840
I have no idea if it will, but hey, we'll see.

40:55.840 --> 40:58.340
I am a big fan of that file system.

40:58.340 --> 40:59.340
Watch it.

40:59.340 --> 41:00.340
And I am a patron of...

41:00.340 --> 41:01.340
Is it Ken?

41:01.340 --> 41:02.340
Right?

41:02.340 --> 41:03.340
Ken to Overstreet.

41:03.340 --> 41:04.340
Ken.

41:04.340 --> 41:05.340
I have a last one.

41:05.340 --> 41:06.340
All right, Mr. Drifter, take it away.

41:06.340 --> 41:07.340
Okay.

41:07.340 --> 41:15.080
In 2019, at the end, Microsoft will begin discussions with TPG in purchasing SUSE.

41:15.080 --> 41:16.080
Huh.

41:16.080 --> 41:17.080
Interesting.

41:17.080 --> 41:18.080
Again?

41:18.080 --> 41:19.080
They're going to get acquired?

41:19.080 --> 41:22.880
You know, I was listening to Late Night Linux, the one that came out this week, and I was

41:22.880 --> 41:26.080
thinking to myself, is SUSE going to get bought again this year?

41:26.080 --> 41:31.080
And I rolled it around in my head, and I didn't really think of a buyer, because they're really

41:31.080 --> 41:33.400
focused on a market outside the US.

41:33.400 --> 41:36.200
And so Microsoft didn't land on that for me, Drifter.

41:36.200 --> 41:40.480
What makes you think Microsoft over, say, maybe making a significant investment in,

41:40.480 --> 41:41.480
say, Canonical?

41:41.480 --> 41:46.560
So the reason that I think that is because, like, SUSE and Windows have kind of been a

41:46.560 --> 41:47.560
thing.

41:47.560 --> 41:50.120
Like, back when it was Novell, they kind of had an agreement with different things.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.120
Okay.

41:51.120 --> 41:55.240
I was talking with Stitch in the chat room about Active Directory services, and I happen

41:55.240 --> 42:00.440
to know a guy who happens to be working on an Active Directory integration with Yast.

42:00.440 --> 42:07.080
So it would make sense, I think, that Windows will buy it, because, like he was mentioning,

42:07.080 --> 42:12.240
it makes sense in the long term for Microsoft to basically make Windows a skin for a Linux

42:12.240 --> 42:13.240
distribution.

42:13.240 --> 42:14.240
Hmm.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.800
Yeah, I've seen that prediction flow around on the internet a couple of times this year,

42:16.800 --> 42:19.920
that Microsoft will ship a desktop environment on Linux.

42:19.920 --> 42:21.520
I think your prediction is pretty solid.

42:21.520 --> 42:23.680
I'll let the ref make the final call.

42:23.680 --> 42:24.680
But what do you think?

42:24.680 --> 42:27.440
Do you think we're ready to go with Microsoft buys SUSE ref?

42:27.440 --> 42:28.440
Yep.

42:28.440 --> 42:29.440
All right.

42:29.440 --> 42:30.440
What do you think, Victor?

42:30.440 --> 42:36.720
I think that in 2019, SUSE and TPG in specific will be in discussion with Microsoft and the

42:36.720 --> 42:38.280
purchase of SUSE.

42:38.280 --> 42:39.640
All right.

42:39.640 --> 42:42.480
So they won't necessarily finish the acquisition or won't be finalized.

42:42.480 --> 42:44.200
But like a purchase is announced.

42:44.200 --> 42:45.200
Yeah.

42:45.200 --> 42:46.200
Right.

42:46.200 --> 42:49.680
And the reason I say that is because, I mean, like it's been discussed, it's kind of already

42:49.680 --> 42:50.680
been purchased by TPG.

42:50.680 --> 42:54.200
They might have to wait a bit to see if it's worth it, you know?

42:54.200 --> 42:55.200
Yeah.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.200
Yeah.

42:56.200 --> 42:57.360
They're probably still working the books out on that.

42:57.360 --> 42:58.360
All right.

42:58.360 --> 43:00.640
So we'll go to Brandon next and then Popey after Brandon.

43:00.640 --> 43:03.840
So Brandon, you have a prediction that involves Dell.

43:03.840 --> 43:04.840
Yeah.

43:04.840 --> 43:11.840
So in 2019, I predict that Dell Technologies or one of its subsidiaries, like VMware, will

43:11.840 --> 43:12.840
purchase SUSE.

43:12.840 --> 43:13.840
Okay.

43:13.840 --> 43:14.840
All right.

43:14.840 --> 43:20.600
You could have just hit the lock-in sound straight away on that.

43:20.600 --> 43:21.600
Almost, right?

43:21.600 --> 43:24.080
Like I was just trying to think like anything I can poke on that.

43:24.080 --> 43:25.320
And I don't think so.

43:25.320 --> 43:28.880
And I think that makes more sense than Microsoft, too, if you think about it.

43:28.880 --> 43:31.000
I have a few reasonings for that.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.000
All right.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.000
Okay.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.500
So SUSE has some overlapping products with VMware that are actually, like specifically

43:36.500 --> 43:40.560
with Pivotal, I think are superior.

43:40.560 --> 43:44.560
Like the way they handle cloud, SUSE handles cloud foundries a little bit better than the

43:44.560 --> 43:47.480
way Pivotal handles cloud foundry and they created it.

43:47.480 --> 43:53.200
And also operating systems become the most relevant thing.

43:53.200 --> 43:57.400
And VMware doesn't have an operating system.

43:57.400 --> 44:03.120
And there was a lot of rumors that years ago that VMware was going to acquire an OVL.

44:03.120 --> 44:08.680
And I think this, it just makes sense that they'll buy it.

44:08.680 --> 44:09.680
That's pretty solid.

44:09.680 --> 44:10.680
Yeah.

44:10.680 --> 44:11.680
That's a pretty solid.

44:11.680 --> 44:12.680
Plenty of enterprise play there.

44:12.680 --> 44:13.680
Yeah.

44:13.680 --> 44:14.680
And EMC.

44:14.680 --> 44:16.160
SUSE has been making a lot of noise about their Kubernetes offering.

44:16.160 --> 44:19.760
And any company that gets involved in that usually helps the stock price.

44:19.760 --> 44:21.960
So Brandon, I think that's pretty great.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.920
I think, yeah, I think I agree with Joe.

44:23.920 --> 44:24.920
Go ahead and lock that in.

44:24.920 --> 44:33.480
In 2019, SUSE will be acquired by Dell Technologies or one of the subsidiaries like VMware.

44:33.480 --> 44:34.480
That's pretty solid.

44:34.480 --> 44:38.600
That would be also one of the best news stories of the year because it'd be so much fun to

44:38.600 --> 44:40.480
talk about SUSE getting sold again.

44:40.480 --> 44:42.440
We could just have a party about it, like a SUSE sale party.

44:42.440 --> 44:44.880
If that, you know, if that happens, we're having a barbecue.

44:44.880 --> 44:45.880
I say it right now.

44:45.880 --> 44:49.240
All right, Mr. Popey, I'd love to hear your next prediction for 2019.

44:49.240 --> 44:50.240
Okay.

44:50.240 --> 45:00.360
In 2019, I predict three AAA titles will withdraw plans for having a native Linux port of games

45:00.360 --> 45:05.000
and they will instead support Proton.

45:05.000 --> 45:10.120
Just a new story out today about Proton getting even more support for more titles.

45:10.120 --> 45:13.320
So does this mean titles that have already announced that they're going to be on Linux

45:13.320 --> 45:14.320
or what?

45:14.320 --> 45:21.400
Well, the ones that are either in early access or beta or almost out, but not quite, or planned

45:21.400 --> 45:27.000
to go out in 2019, so that was their launch window, was 2019, and they're not going to

45:27.000 --> 45:28.000
do Linux.

45:28.000 --> 45:32.320
They're going to do, or they were planning to do Linux in the future at some point, but

45:32.320 --> 45:36.700
whatever plans they had for Linux will be shelved and they'll use Proton instead.

45:36.700 --> 45:39.400
And how exactly are we defining AAA?

45:39.400 --> 45:43.320
Large, big budget companies that you've heard of, not tiny.

45:43.320 --> 45:45.120
So not a kickstarter?

45:45.120 --> 45:46.400
No, no.

45:46.400 --> 45:48.880
These are like reputable companies.

45:48.880 --> 45:52.920
As an example, like EA and Bethesda and those kinds of names that you've heard of rather

45:52.920 --> 45:55.360
than some guy in his bedroom.

45:55.360 --> 45:58.720
And I have to say Proton is shockingly good.

45:58.720 --> 46:01.440
I've been playing the hell out of No Man's Sky again.

46:01.440 --> 46:06.120
Such a fun game for me and it's, you know, just don't even notice it.

46:06.120 --> 46:08.320
I wouldn't even know it's not a native port.

46:08.320 --> 46:09.320
That's pretty good.

46:09.320 --> 46:10.320
Yeah, this makes sense.

46:10.320 --> 46:12.760
I was trying to come up with a Proton Steam prediction and this is better.

46:12.760 --> 46:18.800
Yeah, you got a number, you got a specific action that happens, and the logic for why

46:18.800 --> 46:20.480
that action happens, I think I agree with.

46:20.480 --> 46:22.640
All right, Mr. Popey, I think it's safe to lock that one in.

46:22.640 --> 46:30.560
Okay, in 2019, I predict three AAA titles from well-known publishers will either push

46:30.560 --> 46:35.340
back their Linux port or withdraw their Linux port, but instead use Proton to support their

46:35.340 --> 46:37.960
Linux users.

46:37.960 --> 46:42.640
Now I had an outlandish Proton-based prediction, which is going to be in the next Linux action

46:42.640 --> 46:43.640
news.

46:43.640 --> 46:44.640
But I'm not going to spoil it.

46:44.640 --> 46:45.640
I look forward to that.

46:45.640 --> 46:48.240
Okay, Benton, I'd love to hear your next prediction.

46:48.240 --> 46:52.520
My prediction is canonical will get IPO'd in 2019.

46:52.520 --> 46:55.940
Ah, there's our first solid canonical prediction.

46:55.940 --> 46:56.940
It's nice and concise.

46:56.940 --> 46:57.940
Ref, what do you think?

46:57.940 --> 46:59.840
Yeah, I think you can lock that straight in.

46:59.840 --> 47:06.120
So my prediction for 2019 is that canonical will get IPO'd.

47:06.120 --> 47:08.160
I'm surprised nobody else has made that prediction yet.

47:08.160 --> 47:09.440
I think we would all shine away from that.

47:09.440 --> 47:10.440
Yeah, you know what?

47:10.440 --> 47:11.440
It's not on my list either.

47:11.440 --> 47:15.120
I just, but you almost, you almost kind of hope that happens because like, damn, they're

47:15.120 --> 47:16.120
working hard.

47:16.120 --> 47:19.120
If not, maybe some interesting investment news or something like that.

47:19.120 --> 47:22.840
Well, I'll jump in with my last prediction now.

47:22.840 --> 47:28.800
And that is that Linux sees big market gains in virtual desktops.

47:28.800 --> 47:34.160
It's the year of the Linux virtual desktop, as major cloud providers go mainstream with

47:34.160 --> 47:36.080
their virtual desktop cloud offerings.

47:36.080 --> 47:37.440
So you mean like a cloud desktop?

47:37.440 --> 47:38.440
It's in a browser?

47:38.440 --> 47:43.440
Some sort of Citrix session, any kind of thin client.

47:43.440 --> 47:50.080
But it's you remote in, you get a full Linux desktop and it becomes a mainstream workflow.

47:50.080 --> 47:52.640
And I know this has been brewing under the scenes for years now.

47:52.640 --> 47:54.720
I know a few listeners that use a virtual desktop.

47:54.720 --> 47:59.760
I've experimented with a couple of different options, but in 2019, every major cloud provider

47:59.760 --> 48:04.880
is going to roll out their virtual desktop, even Microsoft roll out their virtual desktop.

48:04.880 --> 48:10.960
And it will be predominantly, maybe with the exception of Microsoft, Linux desktops.

48:10.960 --> 48:17.160
Now, although again, I agree with you on this, it's not measurable.

48:17.160 --> 48:22.800
We need some specific details to measure this by.

48:22.800 --> 48:23.800
You knew this was coming.

48:23.800 --> 48:24.800
These are your rules.

48:24.800 --> 48:29.560
You know what would be really fun is if like DigitalOcean rolled out a virtual desktop.

48:29.560 --> 48:30.560
Wouldn't that be awesome?

48:30.560 --> 48:32.200
Yeah, you can do it with X2GO at the moment.

48:32.200 --> 48:33.560
Yeah, we're all rolling our own anyway.

48:33.560 --> 48:35.620
You can roll your own for sure, yeah.

48:35.620 --> 48:42.860
So Citrix today already supports Linux virtual desktops and so does VMware and so does Red

48:42.860 --> 48:47.000
Hat with Red Hat virtualization using Spice.

48:47.000 --> 48:54.760
So if you're saying a cloud provider, so maybe a better prediction would be a major cloud

48:54.760 --> 49:00.520
provider such as AWS will be supporting Linux virtual desktops.

49:00.520 --> 49:04.160
Well, they already have something now and I've used it.

49:04.160 --> 49:07.080
But what I'm talking about is it becomes a mainstream option.

49:07.080 --> 49:10.600
So you're a business that's rolling out desktops.

49:10.600 --> 49:13.320
The more I talk about it, the more I realize it's not that measurable.

49:13.320 --> 49:15.120
I feel like I need to go specific.

49:15.120 --> 49:17.600
I need to name like a specific provider.

49:17.600 --> 49:22.820
And I'm tempted to either say an Azure Linux desktop or a DigitalOcean Linux desktop.

49:22.820 --> 49:24.040
And I don't know which one I should go with.

49:24.040 --> 49:26.040
You can do both, I guess.

49:26.040 --> 49:29.320
You can hedge your bets as long as you say them both and you're rocking.

49:29.320 --> 49:32.200
I mean, all right, I mean, I was really confident.

49:32.200 --> 49:39.520
I'm confident about the virtual desktop market because I read some white papers.

49:39.520 --> 49:44.000
But they convinced me that like the market for virtual desktops is going to be good in

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
2019.

49:45.000 --> 49:48.480
And then like in 2020 and 2022, it's going to be really good.

49:48.480 --> 49:51.320
So that was what I was trying to base the prediction on is based on just reading those

49:51.320 --> 49:53.000
white papers.

49:53.000 --> 49:58.080
But what I will say is just to make it spicy and to get the approval of the referee.

49:58.080 --> 49:59.760
This is why we got to have a referee really, right?

49:59.760 --> 50:00.760
Yes, it is.

50:00.760 --> 50:04.480
I would have tried to squeak this one in and nobody would have called me on it.

50:04.480 --> 50:07.400
But to be specific, I'm going to say DigitalOcean and Azure.

50:07.400 --> 50:08.400
Are you good with that?

50:08.400 --> 50:12.280
If I say DigitalOcean or Azure launches a virtual desktop that runs Linux?

50:12.280 --> 50:15.880
Yeah, you can say and or or, it's up to you.

50:15.880 --> 50:17.320
I'd say or to hedge your bets.

50:17.320 --> 50:18.320
All right.

50:18.320 --> 50:19.320
All right.

50:19.320 --> 50:20.320
Okay.

50:20.320 --> 50:21.320
All right.

50:21.320 --> 50:22.320
Thank you.

50:22.320 --> 50:23.320
All right.

50:23.320 --> 50:24.320
Okay, here we go.

50:24.320 --> 50:34.960
In 2019, Microsoft Azure or DigitalOcean launches a Linux based virtual desktop.

50:34.960 --> 50:36.940
That's the one I'm probably the least confident about now.

50:36.940 --> 50:40.400
And that was that like that general trend is the one I'm the most confident about.

50:40.400 --> 50:41.400
So that's kind of funny.

50:41.400 --> 50:42.400
That's difficult, right?

50:42.400 --> 50:43.400
All right, Mr. Payne.

50:43.400 --> 50:45.280
I think you have one more, don't you?

50:45.280 --> 50:46.280
I do.

50:46.280 --> 50:47.280
Okay.

50:47.280 --> 50:48.280
All right.

50:48.280 --> 50:54.480
Microsoft says that in 2019, a compiled ZFS module is shipped by another distro outside

50:54.480 --> 50:55.480
of Ubuntu.

50:55.480 --> 51:00.540
Oh, especially with them rebasing a lot of the stuff on ZFS for Linux now.

51:00.540 --> 51:03.040
So it's like the it's the mainstream version of ZFS.

51:03.040 --> 51:04.040
Like there's some steam.

51:04.040 --> 51:05.040
I don't know if it's gonna happen.

51:05.040 --> 51:06.040
It would.

51:06.040 --> 51:07.040
I would love it.

51:07.040 --> 51:08.040
Damn.

51:08.040 --> 51:09.320
I can't believe I didn't think of that one.

51:09.320 --> 51:11.060
That's good.

51:11.060 --> 51:13.680
So like, Debian would count or SUSE.

51:13.680 --> 51:14.680
Well, SUSE is not gonna do it.

51:14.680 --> 51:15.680
That's ridiculous.

51:15.680 --> 51:19.000
I mean, you can't just say a distro because that could be anything that could be just

51:19.000 --> 51:21.140
some random respin of Ubuntu or whatever.

51:21.140 --> 51:22.140
We need some specifics.

51:22.140 --> 51:25.600
I think you need a short list of distros that count.

51:25.600 --> 51:29.240
Or what about like just saying Ubuntu and Ubuntu derivatives don't count?

51:29.240 --> 51:30.240
Would that be fair?

51:30.240 --> 51:31.240
Hmm.

51:31.240 --> 51:32.240
Maybe.

51:32.240 --> 51:33.240
Like a minimum user size or something?

51:33.240 --> 51:34.240
Because like, I don't.

51:34.240 --> 51:37.480
Yeah, again, I'm not trying to count like a tiny bespoke distro, but something with like

51:37.480 --> 51:40.360
that exists now that's an established distribution.

51:40.360 --> 51:42.420
But clear Linux is a bespoke distribution.

51:42.420 --> 51:44.800
And if it's shipped it, I think that would be considered a win.

51:44.800 --> 51:48.840
Okay, it's kind of bespoke, but I mean bespoke like some person on the internet who's not

51:48.840 --> 51:49.840
worried about lawsuits.

51:49.840 --> 51:50.840
You know what I mean?

51:50.840 --> 51:54.560
Like, if you just put some binaries on a DigitalOcean server somewhere, that's not what I'm saying.

51:54.560 --> 51:55.560
Okay.

51:55.560 --> 51:56.560
Intel, you know, Intel's behind clear Linux.

51:56.560 --> 51:57.560
Right.

51:57.560 --> 51:58.560
Okay.

51:58.560 --> 51:59.560
Okay.

51:59.560 --> 52:00.560
All right.

52:00.560 --> 52:01.560
Are you saying a distro that has corporate backing then?

52:01.560 --> 52:02.560
Not necessarily, but just like an established mainstream distribution.

52:02.560 --> 52:03.560
Yeah.

52:03.560 --> 52:04.560
So Arch would count for example.

52:04.560 --> 52:05.560
Arch, Debian, whatever.

52:05.560 --> 52:07.020
Again, I don't think those two will do it.

52:07.020 --> 52:08.400
But those are examples of...

52:08.400 --> 52:10.080
But it would be a hell of a thing if Debian did it.

52:10.080 --> 52:11.080
It would be, wouldn't it?

52:11.080 --> 52:12.160
It would really be a hell of a thing.

52:12.160 --> 52:13.160
I'd love to see that.

52:13.160 --> 52:17.380
I think that we need a list of distros, whereas I'm afraid I think you're going to have to

52:17.380 --> 52:19.040
come up with four or five.

52:19.040 --> 52:20.040
Yeah.

52:20.040 --> 52:21.040
Suse is not going to do it.

52:21.040 --> 52:22.720
They're all in on butterFS with that thing.

52:22.720 --> 52:24.800
So that's not going to happen.

52:24.800 --> 52:25.800
Ubuntu's already doing it.

52:25.800 --> 52:26.800
Red Hat's not going to do it, are they?

52:26.800 --> 52:27.800
No.

52:27.800 --> 52:28.800
Red Hat's not going to do it.

52:28.800 --> 52:29.800
No.

52:29.800 --> 52:30.800
No.

52:30.800 --> 52:31.800
Damn, Wes.

52:31.800 --> 52:32.800
Okay.

52:32.800 --> 52:33.800
Okay.

52:33.800 --> 52:34.800
So should we...

52:34.800 --> 52:35.800
I mean, how do you...

52:35.800 --> 52:36.800
I'm just thinking about this.

52:36.800 --> 52:37.800
I don't know what you've got left after that.

52:37.800 --> 52:38.840
Well, let's look at distro watch right now.

52:38.840 --> 52:40.520
So we need to be clear.

52:40.520 --> 52:42.080
Would Manjaro Linux count?

52:42.080 --> 52:44.400
Yeah, that would count for me.

52:44.400 --> 52:45.400
Okay.

52:45.400 --> 52:46.400
What about Solus?

52:46.400 --> 52:47.400
Yeah.

52:47.400 --> 52:48.400
Really?

52:48.400 --> 52:50.760
As I say on the Ubuntu podcast, hashtag awkward.

52:50.760 --> 52:51.760
Yeah.

52:51.760 --> 52:52.760
I don't know if that one...

52:52.760 --> 52:53.760
What about Void?

52:53.760 --> 52:54.760
What about Anagros?

52:54.760 --> 52:55.760
Yeah.

52:55.760 --> 52:57.720
I feel like Anagros and Void do count.

52:57.720 --> 53:00.360
I feel like Anagros, Manjia, even though it's...

53:00.360 --> 53:02.360
I think that would count.

53:02.360 --> 53:04.360
Boy.

53:04.360 --> 53:07.120
What about something like Kali, which is more of a live environment?

53:07.120 --> 53:10.280
But what if they decided to use EFS for a boot environment or something?

53:10.280 --> 53:15.440
Could you not specify a distro that's been around for more than N years?

53:15.440 --> 53:20.840
So that gives it a heritage and it's established rather than one of these fly-by-night distros.

53:20.840 --> 53:21.840
It's just a wallpaper change.

53:21.840 --> 53:22.840
Will you accept that, referee?

53:22.840 --> 53:23.840
Yeah.

53:23.840 --> 53:24.840
What do you think?

53:24.840 --> 53:25.840
Yeah, I'll accept that.

53:25.840 --> 53:26.840
Okay.

53:26.840 --> 53:27.840
So like a three-year window?

53:27.840 --> 53:28.840
Sure.

53:28.840 --> 53:29.840
That's interesting.

53:29.840 --> 53:30.840
All right.

53:30.840 --> 53:31.840
What do you say?

53:31.840 --> 53:32.840
Yeah, so older than three years?

53:32.840 --> 53:36.840
So a distribution older than three years ships a pre-compiled ZFS kernel.

53:36.840 --> 53:37.840
All right.

53:37.840 --> 53:39.840
Lock it in with.

53:39.840 --> 53:48.120
In 2019, a Linux distribution older than three years will ship a pre-compiled ZFS Linux kernel

53:48.120 --> 53:49.120
module.

53:49.120 --> 53:50.920
I like that.

53:50.920 --> 53:54.880
Now, older than three years in 2019 or older than three years now?

53:54.880 --> 53:55.880
Oh, damn it.

53:55.880 --> 53:56.880
Oh, don't complicate it.

53:56.880 --> 53:57.880
Oh, dang it.

53:57.880 --> 53:59.200
As of the start of the year.

53:59.200 --> 54:01.200
I only realized that after you started saying it.

54:01.200 --> 54:02.200
No, no, no.

54:02.200 --> 54:03.200
Those clarifications are good.

54:03.200 --> 54:04.840
That was a thought-provoking one, though.

54:04.840 --> 54:05.840
I like that.

54:05.840 --> 54:09.120
I like that as a thought exercise, like who else would be left to do it?

54:09.120 --> 54:14.640
And it does seem like it's a long shot, but them rebasing on ZFS on Linux is the best

54:14.640 --> 54:18.280
indicator of like once that becomes like the mainline version that the project considers

54:18.280 --> 54:21.280
upstream, you're more likely to start deploying that.

54:21.280 --> 54:24.800
Someone small enough kind of bets that if someone's going to get sued, it'll be canonical.

54:24.800 --> 54:25.800
Yeah.

54:25.800 --> 54:26.800
Hmm.

54:26.800 --> 54:27.800
Well, now we're all on the record.

54:27.800 --> 54:28.800
We've locked it in.

54:28.800 --> 54:32.480
And my intention is to review this next year and see how we did.

54:32.480 --> 54:36.760
I felt going into it a lot better than I did on the other end of it.

54:36.760 --> 54:43.080
I have a sneaking suspicion that about this time next year, we're going to look like fools.

54:43.080 --> 54:44.080
Maybe.

54:44.080 --> 54:45.080
Maybe.

54:45.080 --> 54:46.080
Definitely.

54:46.080 --> 54:47.080
But that will be fun.

54:47.080 --> 54:48.080
And we're going to get to review it.

54:48.080 --> 54:50.580
And maybe if we keep doing it, we'll get better.

54:50.580 --> 54:53.240
It's been a pretty awesome 2018.

54:53.240 --> 54:59.440
You know, I always debate every single year if I should set a New Year's resolution or

54:59.440 --> 55:00.520
not.

55:00.520 --> 55:04.480
And the one thing that really stops me every time is around this time, I look back at the

55:04.480 --> 55:06.520
year and I go, holy shat.

55:06.520 --> 55:11.320
I mean, I would not have expected that we would all be working now for Linux Academy.

55:11.320 --> 55:12.880
I'd have a day job.

55:12.880 --> 55:14.320
You guys would be part of the team.

55:14.320 --> 55:15.320
Are you kidding me?

55:15.320 --> 55:16.320
That's amazing.

55:16.320 --> 55:20.640
We have a world class editor slash referee known as Joe Resington now on our team.

55:20.640 --> 55:23.360
I had no idea that I'd be getting swole this year either.

55:23.360 --> 55:24.360
Right?

55:24.360 --> 55:25.360
Yeah.

55:25.360 --> 55:28.400
Joe's even inspired me to go to the gym a couple of times a month.

55:28.400 --> 55:30.200
Yeah, I know.

55:30.200 --> 55:31.200
That is amazing.

55:31.200 --> 55:33.760
What a positive influence on the shows and on you.

55:33.760 --> 55:35.680
He's going to be ripped for Linux Fest Northwest.

55:35.680 --> 55:37.600
It's going to be a hell of a thing.

55:37.600 --> 55:38.600
You know what I mean?

55:38.600 --> 55:42.660
Like Joe and all of us at Linux Fest Northwest with me going to the gym a couple of more

55:42.660 --> 55:46.320
times before then and Joe going all the time, it's going to be great.

55:46.320 --> 55:50.560
We can enjoy it all over some hard cider.

55:50.560 --> 55:52.160
Also we just have a few things in the works.

55:52.160 --> 55:58.280
I'll just say for 2019, we're going to be upgrading and improving the live stream with

55:58.280 --> 56:02.360
multi bit rate options and getting our stupid audio stream working again.

56:02.360 --> 56:03.360
That's right.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.360
Finally.

56:04.360 --> 56:05.360
It's very, very close.

56:05.360 --> 56:11.240
We have one more holiday-ish episode that'll be next week on the second.

56:11.240 --> 56:13.560
We're doing our hopes and reviews.

56:13.560 --> 56:18.320
So we'll look back at 2018 and like when you look back at the year, what major stories

56:18.320 --> 56:22.760
really jump out at you and try to look back at the whole year and what really kind of

56:22.760 --> 56:26.760
is the things now with some perspective that really stand out.

56:26.760 --> 56:30.400
And I'd love to have you join us in the mumble room or in the IRC room.

56:30.400 --> 56:34.680
We do it at 2 PM Pacific, but jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar gets it converted to your time

56:34.680 --> 56:35.680
zone.

56:35.680 --> 56:38.720
You can join us in the IRC or you can join us in the mumble.

56:38.720 --> 56:41.320
And I'd love to have you in the mumble because then you can get it in the show.

56:41.320 --> 56:45.320
You can join our virtual log and you can, you can hope cast for what will happen next

56:45.320 --> 56:46.320
year in the open source world.

56:46.320 --> 56:49.560
This is the time to kind of get excited about all the great things that happened this year

56:49.560 --> 56:52.880
and the things we hope can happen in the future.

56:52.880 --> 56:53.880
Absolutely.

56:53.880 --> 56:57.820
And talk about the major things that bent the universe in 2018.

56:57.820 --> 56:59.340
So I love those episodes.

56:59.340 --> 57:03.040
We get to do them once a year and that will be the day after New Year's, we'll be doing

57:03.040 --> 57:08.120
it live and we'd love to have you at jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get it in, get it on the

57:08.120 --> 57:09.120
record.

57:09.120 --> 57:10.120
We won't be locking it in per se.

57:10.120 --> 57:15.540
It'll be more just reminiscing and chatting about it, but that wraps up this special holiday

57:15.540 --> 57:17.360
episode of the unplugged program.

57:17.360 --> 57:19.240
Thank you so much for joining us.

57:19.240 --> 57:26.120
Linux unplugged.com slash two 81 for show notes and links to the things we talked about.

57:26.120 --> 57:28.120
See you back here next week.

57:28.120 --> 57:29.120
Next Tuesday.

57:29.120 --> 57:30.120
Is it Tuesday?

57:30.120 --> 57:31.120
Is it Wednesday?

57:31.120 --> 57:33.120
I don't know, we should, we should know this.

57:33.120 --> 58:02.120
Oh God.

59:03.120 --> 59:07.120
Bye.
