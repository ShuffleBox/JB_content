1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
We've got to get real, we've got to talk about something more important, and that's beer.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,800
And I want to know if you guys have seen Brewy.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,240
It's a fully automated brewing machine with a compact design that runs Linux, and yes

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,720
this was one of my runs Linux, but I've got to talk to you, I've got to share it with

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,720
you guys.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,880
Look at this, it's on IndieGoGo, $109,000 raised already of a goal of $100,000 with

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,880
46 days left.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,840
So they're already at 109% with 46 days left, and I want to play this for you because this

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,320
is the most magical machine ever invented by mankind, and I'm really excited.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,080
Until now.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:39,680
That's why we created Brewy, the first fully automated home brewery.

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,280
Just place the ingredients into the machine, scan the RFID card that comes with the ingredients,

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
and that's it.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,240
Brewy takes care of the rest, exactly like a master brewer would do.

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,320
Brewy is perfect for beginners and experts alike.

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,400
Experiment, modify recipes, or create new ones.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,520
Set the temperature for mashing and loitering, choose your own ingredients, set different

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,860
times for adding hops, or choose one of the 23 other parameters for your brew.

19
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,200
With Brewy, you can literally brew any kind of beer.

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,320
Our system notifies you once your beer is ready, and you can drink it.

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,320
Right on the phone.

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,320
It's always online.

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,120
You can control and monitor your brew by a phone, PC, or tablet, so you have time for

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,040
other important things besides beer.

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,240
Brewy also has an online recipe database where you can browse recipes and even create your

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,240
own recipes.

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,240
Are you seeing this?

28
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,240
An online recipe database.

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
You can save your favorite recipe and reproduce it any time.

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,760
In some places, it is hard to connect with other brewers.

31
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,680
That's why we've created a platform where you can share your experiences, exchange ideas.

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,320
All right, so Blaster, what do you think?

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,560
Do you want to go halfsies on this with me, because this is the most amazing invention

34
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,260
of our lifetime, and I feel like we need to take advantage of this, and we could easily

35
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,720
make it a show segment.

36
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
Yes.

37
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
Let's do this.

38
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
All right.

39
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,720
Okay, we're doing it.

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
I think this is so cool.

41
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
I'm really excited about it.

42
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,720
It's called Brewy.

43
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
Now, here's the problem.

44
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,560
This is why we got to go halfsies, because maybe we want to go thirdsies, actually.

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,720
The beginner pack, 15 out of 50 claimed, $1,500.

46
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Damn it.

47
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,360
Yeah, I mean, this is a real... This is a big boy rig.

48
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
This is the real deal, right?

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,120
I mean, you're making a lot of beer out of this thing, okay?

50
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,360
You're controlling it with your smartphone, and the damn thing runs on Linux.

51
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
I mean, let's get real.

52
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,360
Of course, it's $1,500.

53
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,760
It should be more than that.

54
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,760
Think about it.

55
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
It runs on Linux.

56
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,280
Let me tell you about some of the specs before you get a little scared away.

57
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,400
It's got a 4.3 inch color LCD screen on the front.

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,800
It has 802.11 BG and N, plus an RFID transceiver built in.

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
It's got a USB port.

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,680
This is a brewer, an automatic brewer, okay?

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,560
It can hold 20 liters, 5.2 gallons for us yanks.

62
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,980
Takes about five to six hours to brew, and then 14 days for fermentation.

63
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,340
That's amazing, okay?

64
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,520
That's worth $1,500 right there.

65
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
Okay.

66
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,880
It runs something called, and I'm not familiar with this, Pokey-based Linux.

67
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,160
What the hell is Pokey-based Linux?

68
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,600
I don't know, but you manage it from Android, iOS, Windows Phone, mobile apps, or just a

69
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,120
generic web interface.

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,920
It has magnetic valves with brushless pumps, stainless steel containers, 20,000 hour pumps,

71
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:16,400
automatic water inlet, two, my friends, automatic hop inserters, okay?

72
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,080
Solid state relay controls.

73
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,080
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,080
How could we not back this?

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,200
I almost feel like it's so damn expensive, but this is the most... We got to get these

76
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
people on the show.

77
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,160
Rotten Corpse, you got to make a note about this.

78
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,160
We got to get these people-

79
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
Party now.

80
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Oh, you are.

81
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,160
Yeah, we got to talk to these-

82
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
He's on it.

83
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
Maybe we can get a review unit.

84
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
This is amazing.

85
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
Okay.

86
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,520
Would this bring back beer as tasty?

87
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,520
We would have to.

88
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
I mean, I think it would.

89
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
Uh-huh.

90
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
I think that would happen.

91
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,680
See, they had early... See, I wish I would have jumped on this early, because they had

92
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,260
$100,000 early bird packages.

93
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,400
This would create a competition between the brewers at Linux Fest Northwest.

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Yeah.

95
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Yeah.

96
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Oh, here's the-

97
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Yeah, totally.

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Here's what we'd want, too.

99
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,560
The unique skin package includes all the items of the professional package... Oh, a professional

100
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
package, huh?

101
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
That sounds like us, too.

102
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,280
We're professionals, right?

103
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,400
But you get to add your own logo to it.

104
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Come on, let's do this.

105
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,680
We could put the Jupiter Broadcasting logo on there.

106
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,220
But the professional package, check this out, includes a beginner package... Oh, hello.

107
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,320
These accessories include a pH meter.

108
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,320
Nice.

109
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,440
Amazing.

110
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,360
One measuring cylinder, one water quality testing instrument, and one ball and hydrometer.

111
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,640
I don't think I'll say that right.

112
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,320
This is really exciting.

113
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,280
When beer and Linux come together, magic happens.

114
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,480
So anyways, it's Brewery, and it's on IndieGoGo.

115
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,360
Hey, those guys at Linux Fest proved that.

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,280
Yeah, it's still got 46 days left, too.

117
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,560
So if you want to fund that ass, there is a link in the show notes.

118
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,640
Gosh, that's cool.

119
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,400
I really, really want one.

120
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Man.

121
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,120
I smell a revival of podcasts.

122
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,480
You know, I tell you what, guys.

123
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:58,800
The truth of the matter is... I'm not bitter, but if I had Leo Laporte money...

124
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,920
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

125
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,640
I would be just buying all kinds of crap.

126
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,440
I would just be buying crap like that all the time.

127
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,440
It does.

128
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
Yeah.

129
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:13,440
Well, it looks like they're based in Hungary, so regionally, they're closer to Popeye and

130
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,520
Popeye, so I think you should have it sent to the UK and save on shipping expenses.

131
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
I agree.

132
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
All right.

133
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,520
All right.

134
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
Okay.

135
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,640
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's filled with the holiday

136
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,720
GNU spirit, well, and a little bit of Santa's rum.

137
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,240
My name is Chris.

138
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,240
My name is Matt.

139
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Hey there, Matt.

140
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,520
So we got so much going on in today's episode.

141
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,600
It's a little ridiculous, so I'm really excited.

142
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,360
Coming up earlier on in the show, we're going to talk with Antibody from the Xenotic Project

143
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,640
about something really cool coming up in my favorite open source game, but there's also

144
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,280
some other news in gaming that we're going to get to for the holidays because there's

145
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,220
probably going to be a big sale coming up, but later on in the show, Dustin Kirkland

146
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,280
from Canonical comes back with some additional comments about Ubuntu Snappy potentially being

147
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,760
the future of the Ubuntu project, so I'll ask him about that and we'll get his insights

148
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,760
on that.

149
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,880
So what the heck is Juju and how does it fit into the whole Ubuntu core thing?

150
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,560
He'll answer that and what all the different packages are, and then later on in the show,

151
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,000
it's our community review of Fedora 21.

152
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,680
We're going to get everybody's opinion on how it's been since they've installed it.

153
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,360
I'll give you some additional thoughts that I've had trying out Fedora 21, so it's a really,

154
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,080
really big show, and on top of that, we got a whole bunch of feedback, Matt.

155
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,200
It's a little cray, so why don't we get started?

156
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Let's clear the deck.

157
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,800
Let's bring in the awesome mumble room, Goldfish, who I believe is here for his first time even

158
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
for Linux Unplugged.

159
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,840
All of you, welcome.

160
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,640
Time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

161
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
Hey.

162
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,640
Hey.

163
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
Hello.

164
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Hey.

165
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
Hi.

166
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
Hi.

167
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
Hello, hello.

168
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
It sounds like there's like three of you.

169
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,640
You guys got to get better at that.

170
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
You got to really represent.

171
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,520
All right, so let's get started here.

172
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,720
Yesterday, before we go too much further here, yesterday we had something kind of exciting

173
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,360
happen.

174
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,600
We launched on the Quota Radio Show an open source project right here on the Jupiter Broadcasting

175
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:18,580
Network, GPL2, and I believe it may prove to fundamentally be the most important project

176
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,840
for 2015 of all open source projects, Matt.

177
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Whoa.

178
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Yeah.

179
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
Oh, yeah, yeah.

180
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,320
Yeah, it's called Open Your Mouth, and it's at OpenYourMouth.recipes.

181
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,440
These are open source GPL2-licensed recipes from the Jupiter Broadcasting Community.

182
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,960
This is an opportunity to go out there and meet your fellow Jupiter Broadcasting developer,

183
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,880
learn a little GitHub and Markdown in the process, and commit your recipes to one central

184
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
place, OpenYourMouth.

185
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,760
We've set it up, OpenYourMouth.recipes.com.

186
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,440
It's open source recipes from the Jupiter Broadcasting Community, and it's actually,

187
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,400
you know, it's kind of amazing.

188
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,640
It's taking off in a big way.

189
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,960
We've got breakfast, desserts, pizzas, sandwiches, sauces, different types of these things.

190
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,240
And Matt, this is already a huge hit.

191
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
That's awesome.

192
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
I love it.

193
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
So go to OpenYourMouth.recipes.

194
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,240
OpenYourMouth.recipes.

195
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
Okay.

196
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
And Rekai's been in there.

197
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,080
He's been engaging with the community, and right now they're working on a pretty killer

198
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,000
barbecue pizza, and they've merged in some of the changes.

199
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,860
Everything's written down in Markdown, so if you just want to go look at the recipe,

200
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,480
you can read them.

201
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,240
And here's what we were thinking.

202
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,160
We talk a lot about open source code and community and all of that, but I realize there are hundreds

203
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,960
of developers that listen to these shows that are not talking to each other, that run into

204
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
jams.

205
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,060
You know, they get into a spot where they're stuck and they need a resource.

206
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,240
They're not communicating, even though they're all listening to the same content.

207
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,680
Wouldn't it be cool if we could create a fun, sort of no pressure way for people to connect,

208
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,520
maybe even for folks that are not familiar with GitHub, maybe folks that want to learn

209
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:02,040
Markdown or just connect with a community that's pretty cool, but not have to know code.

210
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,680
And that's what we've done here.

211
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,760
It's tongue-in-cheek, but it's also a serious attempt to give people a way to connect.

212
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,360
Also we're encouraging people to hang out in our Jupyter Dev chat room.

213
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,000
We have a dedicated JB Dev chat room on Geek Shed.

214
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,960
In fact, if you want to know more about any of this, we've got a whole bunch of projects

215
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,000
going on for the community to work on right now.

216
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,440
If you're interested in developing code for the Jupyter Broadcasting Network, go to jbdev.community.

217
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,560
Blaster set that up for us, jbdev.community, and it will give you a link of resources,

218
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,360
all of them right there, like different account information, the IRC info.

219
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,120
Well hello there, hello there.

220
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,800
And that's a great place to start also, Jupyter Dev on the IRC is another place to start.

221
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,320
And it's really kind of fun to see people work on this.

222
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,680
We're launching a lot of projects in 2015, and so we're trying to get people engaged

223
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,200
and that's kind of just a fun way to start.

224
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,600
And it turns out, some pretty good recipes.

225
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,360
We started it yesterday and now there's more than a dozen, I think it's actually a lot

226
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
more than that.

227
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,360
I like how bacon's at the top.

228
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,760
Oh Matt, yeah.

229
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,760
Let's not kid ourselves.

230
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,000
And Angel and I want to submit some of our own recipes from the Fisher family.

231
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,720
And then before we get into our feedback, which I got a great one, I'm really glad,

232
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,720
so this is the last Linux Unplugged before Christmas.

233
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,280
Next week we will have a new episode, but it is a best of episode.

234
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:29,140
However, right now, Linux Unplugged has the least submissions for best ofs, and I know

235
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,320
we've had some great moments.

236
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,960
We've had some great arguments, we've had some great interviews, we've had some, we've

237
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,640
had like, there's some stuff we've already got on the list.

238
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,840
Like when Wimpy released the Ubuntu Mate 14.04 live on the show, how do you top that?

239
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,080
Like that's already on our list.

240
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,280
But we still need your help.

241
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,640
At the top of the show notes, your best of submissions.

242
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,760
Linux Unplugged, for some reason, has the least amount of submissions right now.

243
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,660
Now come on, we all love the Unplugged show, right?

244
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,560
So hook us up with your submissions, go over there, you'll find a link at the top of the

245
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,500
show notes if you go look at episode 71 of Linux Unplugged.

246
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,120
We just need the episode title, a link to the episode, the time code, and what it was.

247
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,120
And then Rekai, see the thing is, what we're trying to do here is we're trying to give

248
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,120
everybody time off, but the problem is we don't get these submissions in.

249
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,960
I'm afraid Rekai might start pulling the hair out of his beard, and he has a beautiful beard,

250
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,440
and I do not want to see that happen.

251
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
Right?

252
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,920
I mean, could you imagine, Matt, if he starts tearing it, that thing's a masterpiece.

253
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Oh my goodness.

254
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,360
I picture him chasing us around the studio with like beard particles in hand, just screaming.

255
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,360
Yeah, absolutely.

256
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,080
When you have a content catalog as deep as ours, and the shows that are as long as they

257
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,840
are, it is the most, just assembling a best of, just all of the formatting that goes into

258
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,520
that is an incredible task, but he really could use your help, and we have links at

259
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,520
the top of the show notes.

260
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,160
You literally have like just a few hours.

261
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,040
So if you're listening to this show now, please go do it, because it takes days and days and

262
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,260
days and days of work just for one single episode, and he's working on them already.

263
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,260
He's already started.

264
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,480
All right, let's get into our first bit of feedback.

265
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,480
KZ650 sent a frequent chatter, emails into the show about IPFire, and this was an email

266
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,760
that I was really glad to get in towards the end of 2014, because earlier in the year,

267
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,360
I had decided Chris is going to replace the firewalls both at JBHQ, which is where the

268
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,880
operations happen, and JB1 Studios, which is where the production happens.

269
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,920
At both ends, I wanted to replace the firewalls.

270
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,780
My leading candidate for replacing those firewalls was PFSense, but the thing is PFSense runs

271
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,160
on FreeBSD, and I didn't really want to deploy FreeBSD when I do this other show called the

272
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,240
Linux Action Show.

273
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,580
Just didn't feel right.

274
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,760
So I was looking around for suggestions on what I could use instead, and I still haven't

275
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,080
really come to a conclusion.

276
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:45,320
Colonel Linux thinks I should use these MicroTik routers that look pretty compelling, and he's

277
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:52,280
even so far into it, he's even sent me two of them now to make sure I deploy them.

278
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,860
And then on the other end, I've looked at a few other distributions to see if something

279
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,680
met my needs, and I wasn't really happy with any of them until KZ650 sent emails in about

280
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
IPFire.

281
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,400
He says, Chris and Matt, you've mentioned in the past about the epicness of PFSense.

282
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,600
You talk about it all the time on TechSnap even, but you've never mentioned IPFire.

283
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,680
After using several firewall distros, I landed on IPFire, and it's awesome.

284
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,520
It's a very good project, and it deserves a spotlight.

285
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,060
So I went and checked it out, Matt, and it totally, well, it basically kind of looks

286
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,060
like PFSense.

287
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,720
You download the ISO, and it is a dedicated firewall distribution, and you can get a nice

288
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,320
gooey on top of that to manage your firewall rules.

289
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,960
And it looks really nice.

290
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,020
So I'm going to take a look at IPFire.

291
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:39,080
Right now, I'm leaning towards the Microtech routers, or whatever they're called.

292
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,560
Colonel X, do you have any thoughts on this?

293
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
Are you listening?

294
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,560
No.

295
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,640
We know he's got thoughts on it.

296
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,640
I'm sure he does.

297
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
Hey, I do have thoughts.

298
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
Here's the thing.

299
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,800
For me, and I've done a lot of soul searching over the past couple years, and I think what

300
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,560
I've come down to is it comes down to this.

301
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,020
My first priority is that something runs on Linux, whether or not it's open source, whether

302
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,560
or not it's, I don't mind paying for something, like Steam is a perfect example.

303
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,720
I'll pay for it, and it's not open source, but it runs perfectly on Linux.

304
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,680
So that's my, like, that's my bare line.

305
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,900
And then after that, if it's open source, even better.

306
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,960
And after that, if it's true free software, foundation, specialty stuff, even better.

307
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,960
That's like double, double better, yeah.

308
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Right.

309
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,480
But with the Microtech, it meets that very bottom line.

310
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,080
Everything works perfectly on Linux, which I can't say is the same for Cisco.

311
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,840
And I can do all the stuff that I could do on the Microtechs that I used to be able to

312
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,360
do on Cisco, except it all works on Linux, oh, and by the way, it's like a tenth of

313
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
the price.

314
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
Yeah.

315
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
All right.

316
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,360
I mean, and I like their size, too.

317
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
So it's something I'm going to figure out soon.

318
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
I got to get this solved.

319
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,560
I got to get this problem worked out.

320
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:41,280
I've got a mess right now where my home network and the studio network are using the same

321
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,360
IP address space, so it screws the hell out of my devices when I move between them.

322
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,680
I cannot manage them remotely when I'm at one location or the other.

323
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:53,480
I feel like I'm in the 1990s where TCP IP is this new thing that's really neat that I'm

324
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,400
trying out, but I still prefer IPX.

325
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,560
So yeah, this is a problem I've got to solve seriously in early January or else I think

326
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,360
my blood pressure will suffer.

327
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,040
All right.

328
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,400
I'll tell you what doesn't make my blood pressure suffer.

329
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,000
I'll tell you what makes me feel a little bit better, and that's personal accomplishments,

330
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
seriously.

331
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,920
And that's why Linux Academy is a great sponsor for Linux Unplugged.

332
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,920
I can go there.

333
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
I can challenge myself.

334
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,360
I can see what interests me.

335
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,760
And I know that Linux Academy is built by people who truly understand and know Linux.

336
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,440
They are Linux users themselves.

337
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,360
They're not generic educators.

338
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,120
They don't have everything from fixing the sink to setting up an Apache server.

339
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,680
They're people that genuinely love and use Linux themselves.

340
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,280
Educators, Linux users, system administrators, developers that came together and they created

341
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,480
something they're passionate about, and that's Linux Academy.

342
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,080
And if you go to linuxacademy.com.plugged, you'll get a 33% discount, and that's for

343
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,080
the lifetime right there.

344
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
Boom.

345
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,320
Actually, I think it's for the quarter.

346
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
Go over there and check it out.

347
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,240
Go to linuxacademy.com.plugged.

348
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,500
Try them out for a little while and see what the discount is.

349
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,040
It's 33% off.

350
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,120
That's if you think about it, sort of an amazing discount.

351
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,720
They have everything you'd want to learn, seriously.

352
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,680
Everything from doing your own backups to managing your own Linux servers.

353
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,480
You can choose from 7 plus Linux distributions that automatically adjust the course.

354
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,000
If you're in DevOps, if you're learning about OpenStack, if you're learning about Docker,

355
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,560
they've got courses on that.

356
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,480
They're always adding new content constantly.

357
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,180
In fact, they just wrapped up the puppet professional courses from beginner to puppet professional

358
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,840
to be certified ready at Linux Academy.

359
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,120
Vagrant, they've got courses on that.

360
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,020
Docker, courses on that.

361
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,680
They're on top of all of this stuff because they're Linux enthusiasts themselves, so they

362
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,000
are following the technology trends.

363
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,800
They're following the open source developments.

364
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,840
They're watching all of this, and then they're curating the courseware based on that.

365
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,880
Nobody else can offer that.

366
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,840
Linuxacademy.com.plugged.

367
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,840
Go there.

368
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,840
Check it out.

369
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
Sign up.

370
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,400
I've been using them now for months.

371
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,380
It's seriously one of the best online learning tools I've ever seen in many years.

372
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,440
I go back to years when it required some clunky ActiveX installer.

373
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,640
It was the worst of the worst.

374
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,640
It was like, here Chris, we have bought you this as part of your educational package for

375
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,200
working here.

376
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,240
This is the course you can take, and it was the worst.

377
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,760
Linux Academy is nothing like that.

378
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,100
They have learning plans where you can go in and tell them how much time you have available.

379
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,960
They'll automatically create courseware based on that time availability with reminders and

380
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:27,520
quizzes and self-checks, and they also have a community that's available to you.

381
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,960
And I think one of the best things about Linux Academy is the way that they automatically

382
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,560
spin up virtual machines on demand that match the courseware.

383
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,880
They give you remote access to them.

384
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,320
You log in over SSH.

385
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,500
You actually work with the technology you're learning about.

386
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,580
You can download the comprehensive study guides, bring them with you on the phone, treat

387
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:50,000
them as podcasts, be like Skookiesprite, listen to them in the shower.

388
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,280
This is a really great opportunity, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

389
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,540
They also have added a lot of DevOps content in the past few months because that's an area

390
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:02,120
that's really growing, and they've really doubled down on it, linuxacademy.com slash

391
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
unplugged.

392
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,560
And a huge thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

393
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:14,320
You guys, like almost every week, you guys have something new for me to talk about, and

394
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,120
that is truly a treat, and it is really neat, and it's really awesome to watch them work.

395
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,480
I feel a bit of a kinship with them.

396
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,560
I feel like if Jupyter Broadcasting were to start today, maybe I might go this direction.

397
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,680
And they are truly advocating and spreading the use of Linux by making it accessible to

398
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,440
learn to everybody, from experts to beginners.

399
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,780
I think they're one of the best sponsors we've ever had, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

400
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,880
Go check them out, and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged

401
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,880
program.

402
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,920
All right.

403
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,360
So I wanted to start with some, let's start with a bang, literally.

404
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,000
Why don't we talk with Antibody.

405
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,760
Antibody is joining us in the mumble room.

406
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,480
We have an open mumble room, and you're welcome to join us.

407
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,920
We just do a mic check.

408
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,300
He's joining us from the Xenotic Project, my favorite first person shooter.

409
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,300
It's open source.

410
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:03,580
We often talk about Steam games, and I'm delighted when we get a chance to talk about a genuine

411
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,940
open source game.

412
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,880
So Antibody, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

413
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,540
How are you doing today, sir?

414
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,640
I'm doing great, Chris.

415
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Thanks for having me.

416
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
Absolutely.

417
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,960
So, you know me, we've had a Xenotic server for quite a while.

418
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,680
I've been a player of Xenotic for quite a bit, but a little birdie told me there's something

419
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,240
new in the works coming up in the near future.

420
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,640
Yes, indeed.

421
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,720
That little birdie is correct, and thanks for running a server, by the way.

422
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,880
I didn't get the chance to check your server ID to sport you some nice stats, but yeah,

423
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,720
the little birdie says that there's going to be a release quote unquote soon.

424
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Very soon.

425
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,200
Maybe even before the new year?

426
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Like maybe.

427
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,120
You know, this is an open source project, and we have like a gazillion developers from

428
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,480
around the world, so we got to herd the cats.

429
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
You know what I mean?

430
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

431
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,360
So what kind of things, and when this new release does land, what kind of things are

432
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,840
we looking forward to?

433
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,920
Okay, so drum roll please.

434
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
Wait for it.

435
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Wait for it.

436
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,920
Okay, no.

437
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,960
So Xenotic's getting a new weapon, actually.

438
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,560
The long-awaited ARC is going to be arriving, well actually has arrived in Master if you

439
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,880
run a git.

440
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:20,960
But to the ARC, if you are from the Quake slash genre of shooters, ARC is like the lightning

441
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
gun.

442
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,960
Right?

443
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
Yes.

444
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,960
Oh my gosh, I love that gun.

445
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,000
We're working on some really, really cool audio effects at the moment, get it to echo

446
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,480
and sound like really powerful, really meaty, you know?

447
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
Yeah.

448
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,160
And other dudes, so we've got three new official maps, we're focusing on the capture the flag

449
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,960
game mode, so we have three official new maps for that.

450
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:50,040
We have a very active developer in Mario who's developed this really neat little system that

451
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,560
he calls buffs.

452
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:59,240
And so it's not like your little strength or shield type power-ups, they're more wacky.

453
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,520
So you get this so-called buff, it's like a hovering little coin thing, right?

454
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,320
And then suddenly you can fly, or suddenly you can move really fast.

455
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,320
Oh, really?

456
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:14,860
So we've got a bunch of little variety, a little potpourri, if you will, into the game.

457
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,440
So tell me, so give me a little background for folks that are not familiar.

458
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,880
Xenotic is a first-person shooter, you can set up your own server, am I correct when

459
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,840
I say it's based on the Quake 3 engine, or is that wrong?

460
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,800
It is actually based on Quake 1, but it's like uber-modified.

461
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,680
I would say it looks amazing for that.

462
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,240
It's basically like taking the core engine out of a game and stripping it all the way

463
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,700
down, building it back up with some kind of more realistic expectations.

464
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:53,400
We're not going to pretend that we're a state-of-the-art engine, but it's pretty darn spiffy.

465
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,960
It seems like it, I would say, here's how I would rate the graphics.

466
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,560
It's still rewarding on a higher Nvidia class card, but it's still playable on, say, the

467
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,600
Iris graphics, which is a pretty great range, and it also means it's pretty playable on

468
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,920
a lot of the open-source drivers, right?

469
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,120
Absolutely, it's playable on your open-source drivers, and more than just playable, it's

470
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,280
really configurable.

471
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,080
So we have people running it off of, like, I personally have an Acer Revo that runs Xenotic

472
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,440
just fine off of a little teeny Atom processor.

473
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
Very cool.

474
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:32,000
Well, so we should be checking out Xenotic.org, X-O-N-O-T-I-C.org, maybe around the New Year's

475
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,960
timeframe around in that area?

476
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:40,680
Yeah, in that general vicinity, yeah, and look for the new maps, look for the new weapon.

477
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,360
We got a nice tiered server browser.

478
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,160
Before we would just kind of slap you with all the servers, a ginormous list that you

479
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,160
had to parse through.

480
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,280
Well, and I'm looking at the servers, I'm looking at the most active servers, and it's

481
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,040
very disappointing, Jupiter Broadcasting, which was once at number one, is now falling to

482
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,160
number 25.

483
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,400
So if you guys go out there and install Xenotic, join the Jupiter Broadcasting last Xenotic

484
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,600
server and get that number back up there.

485
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,120
We used to rank it, so I think we can do it again.

486
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
Yeah, come on, guys.

487
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
Yeah, right?

488
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,120
Get fragging.

489
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,240
So Antibody, you do me a solid and come back on the show when the new release comes out,

490
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,080
and maybe we'll do a little live gameplay and the mumble room can shoot each other and

491
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,080
all that?

492
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
Absolutely.

493
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,400
I would love to personally frag you, Chris.

494
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,960
I'll hover, you know, my right index finger.

495
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
It's really itchy.

496
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
All right.

497
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
You know what I'm saying?

498
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
All right.

499
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
It's really itchy.

500
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
Fair enough.

501
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
You know what?

502
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
I will take it.

503
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
I will take it.

504
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
I will.

505
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,960
I am horrible at games.

506
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
But all right.

507
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
I'm an old man.

508
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,400
So before we get out of the feedback segment, and thanks to Antibody for coming on and talking

509
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,680
about that, I wanted to send out a request to the audience to get their feedback on Wallbag.

510
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
What?

511
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
Yeah.

512
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,680
Wallbag.

513
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
Wallbag.

514
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,200
And maybe if anybody in the mumble room has any experience with Wallbag, I'd love to hear

515
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,200
about this.

516
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,840
But I've recently talked about on Linux Action Show this Sunday how I use Instapaper to read

517
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,440
long form articles.

518
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,040
And in Instapaper, I have the open dyslexic font configured.

519
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,080
Now there is an alternative to Instapaper that is open source that you could host yourself

520
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,360
even called Wallbag.

521
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,680
And it does the same thing.

522
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,520
It goes, it's like an offline stash where you can read stuff later.

523
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,180
The thing is, is I don't know what the end reading experience is like with Wallbag.

524
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,500
But because this is something I do a lot for our shows.

525
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,920
When I'm in the middle of something and I see an article that's relevant to our shows,

526
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,600
but it's going to take me more than a few minutes to read, I send it to Instapaper and

527
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,800
then I go offline later and I read it all.

528
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,200
And so Wallbag would be, it's something I could put on a DigitalOcean droplet.

529
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,880
It's something that could be under my control.

530
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,260
And you know how I'm all for that.

531
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,360
But I have no idea what the experience is like.

532
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,400
And I'm putting a request out there to the audience to go over to the contact form and

533
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,520
send in their feedback or in the subreddit.

534
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,840
And I wonder if anybody in the mumble room has any experience with Wallbag.

535
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,840
No.

536
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,840
Negative.

537
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,840
Negative?

538
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,840
Okay.

539
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
No.

540
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,760
Yeah, I really hadn't heard a lot about it either.

541
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,280
But I've seen it for a long time and so I'll put my feelers out there.

542
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,560
We'll see what happens.

543
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,840
And maybe somebody out there has tried it and they can send us in their feedback.

544
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,840
Oh!

545
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,840
Oh!

546
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,840
You hear that?

547
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
Oh!

548
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,840
Oh!

549
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,760
Oh, I think it's time for a little Steam update too.

550
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,640
So speaking of, before we get away from gaming completely, super quick here, Boiling Steam

551
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,000
has a great post on a proper end of year of gaming on Linux.

552
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,280
And there's been some recent releases that are really big deals for Linux.

553
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,600
And we won't spend a lot of time on this, I know not all of you are big gamers.

554
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,080
But for those of you that are gamers, there's some holiday sales coming up and there's some

555
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,120
great games that have come out.

556
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:43,200
A Metro 23 Redux has relaunched and this is the rebuilt version that has a lot better

557
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
textures.

558
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,920
Linux Gamecast just did a review on that if you want to check that out.

559
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:51,400
For you football fans, Football Manager 2015 is out.

560
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,200
Some games that we weren't expecting, Empire Total War, and this has gotten some serious

561
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,680
traction in our subreddit.

562
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:02,920
Geometry Wars 3 is an Aspire port, which Aspire has done all good work so far and it's a great

563
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
game.

564
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,480
I had my friend John just totally consumed by it.

565
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,320
War Thunder, it's an MMO shooter, which looks really fun.

566
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,400
And Counter Strike Global Offensive, of course, we've given mention to.

567
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,840
Also expected before the end of the year, Civilization Beyond Earth.

568
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,160
So there's a lot of really good games.

569
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,480
Zonotic obviously an open source option that's really great.

570
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,080
And if you are thinking about picking up some Steam games, I just want to, just a quick

571
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,940
PSA to remind you, try to buy them under the Linux Steam client so that way the Linux sale

572
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
is counted.

573
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,080
I'm not sure what happens if you buy it on the web.

574
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,840
And even if you buy it on a Windows machine and then play it under Linux, at least for

575
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,520
two weeks, that sale is going to be counted towards Windows.

576
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,440
So if you can, make these purchases as the Steam holiday sale comes up on your Linux

577
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,840
rig as sort of a vote for supporting Linux.

578
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,840
Just something to remind people about as we get close to the crazy ass rape your wallet

579
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,120
Steam sale that comes up where I feel like Gabe personally comes into my house, knocks

580
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,920
everything over, breaks all my piggy banks, and takes all of my money.

581
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,480
It's a holly jolly time of year.

582
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,760
And then yells at the top of his lungs, you're welcome.

583
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,800
You wanted this!

584
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:20,840
Alright so we had Dustin Kirkland come on the show and I asked him some questions pertaining

585
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,280
to the future of the Ubuntu project.

586
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,360
So we're going to play that here in just a second.

587
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,980
It's some extra stuff that didn't make it into our last review.

588
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,680
And I don't know, I think it could make for a great desktop.

589
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,560
I think it's a pretty compelling option.

590
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,520
I'll play his answer and we'll talk about it.

591
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,720
But first I want to mention DigitalOcean.

592
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,900
Head over to DigitalOcean.com right now and let's give the Linux Unplugged show a great

593
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,160
end of 2014 showing.

594
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,040
Use the promo code UnpluggedDecember when you actually just apply it to your account.

595
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,840
It's a habit to say when you check out, but it's actually you can apply the balance to

596
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,680
your account even after you've signed up if you forgot to use it.

597
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,340
UnpluggedDecember will give you a $10 credit for DigitalOcean.

598
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,420
Now we've talked about DigitalOcean for a long, long time.

599
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:10,380
And it really is one of the coolest resources and one of the coolest manifestations of different

600
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:15,080
Linux technologies that has been put into a product that is also extremely awesome for

601
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,160
Linux users to use.

602
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
So what is it?

603
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,520
If you're not familiar, DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to

604
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,900
offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

605
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,800
Now why does that matter?

606
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,740
Well that matters because if it's super simple and straightforward for you to set up, not

607
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,940
a hobbled system, but a system that you have full access, full control over, that you can

608
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,500
deploy applications to with one click.

609
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,860
And if that process of setting that up just takes mere moments or can even be scripted,

610
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,320
that fundamentally changes it.

611
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,980
Removing all of that friction is a huge deal and DigitalOcean saw that and they realized

612
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,180
that's why the UI was super important and then they built it on top of SSD drives way

613
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,640
before anybody else was doing SSD and of course they had to pair it with tier one bandwidth.

614
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,380
And you can get started in less than a minute and pricing plans start at only five dollars

615
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,380
a month.

616
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,860
So if you use our promo code unplugdecember with that ten dollar credit, you can go for

617
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,860
two months.

618
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:15,700
Here's what you're going to get for five dollars, 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one

619
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,380
CPU and a terabyte of transfer, a terabyte.

620
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,500
And they have data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam

621
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,900
and London.

622
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,260
But that interface right, I mean it's inspired.

623
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:35,260
It's so simple and very intuitive and power users can replicate that interface on a larger

624
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,980
scale with DigitalOcean's straightforward API.

625
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,540
And I've said that a lot, but I want to show you how that actually manifests in stuff you

626
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,540
can use.

627
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,780
Now you could take advantage of that API.

628
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:49,020
Maybe you have more skills than I have and you would actually be able to write your own

629
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:53,060
scripts or manage to snap it into your own puppet management infrastructure on your own.

630
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:58,620
That honestly is just beyond my capability, but what is easily within my capability is

631
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:02,340
taking advantage of all of the cool stuff that the DigitalOcean community has already

632
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,300
created around this API for me for absolutely free.

633
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,340
Like it's just a benny of being a DigitalOcean customer.

634
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:11,260
Like number one, right here, dropper control panel.

635
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,260
Have you seen this?

636
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:17,420
This is a management control panel for your DigitalOcean droplets for the Android device.

637
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,140
There's even a nicer one for iOS.

638
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:24,620
But you know I know most of you are probably Android users, no judging, that's cool.

639
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,660
Dropper control panel.

640
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:31,900
It lets you start them up, back them up, copy them, move them around, take a snapshot, resize

641
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,160
them, rename them from your freaking Android, right?

642
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,380
That's just one use of the API.

643
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,860
Here's another cool one, Lita.

644
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:45,780
It's a chatroom bot that allows you to manage your DigitalOcean droplet within an IRC room.

645
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,260
Now why would you want to use that?

646
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,020
Psst, Honey Badger, I don't know.

647
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,840
But I think that's amazing.

648
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,060
The fact that you can do that is amazing.

649
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,060
Here's another one.

650
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,300
We're going to talk with Dustin very soon.

651
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,360
Juju DigitalOcean provider.

652
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,940
This is a way to snap in your DigitalOcean droplets with your Juju management infrastructure.

653
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,540
And you can start doing all of this for $5 per month.

654
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:09,740
And if you're just an average user, you don't have anything super sophisticated like this

655
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,760
that you want to do, that doesn't matter.

656
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,100
You can still take advantage of $5 a month to build your own own cloud installation,

657
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,300
your own BitTorrent sync server, your own GitLab instance.

658
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,140
You can do all of this with DigitalOcean and if you use our promo code, unplug December,

659
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,140
you'll get that $10 credit.

660
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,580
You can try it out for two months for absolutely free.

661
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,580
DigitalOcean.com.

662
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,580
Go check them out.

663
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,540
Use the promo code, unplug December when you check out.

664
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:36,400
And a huge thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux unplug program.

665
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,540
You guys are so awesome and the community around them.

666
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,780
And I didn't even get a chance to mention their tutorials that you can go right up and

667
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,080
they'll pay you for them.

668
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,180
It's so slick.

669
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,060
DigitalOcean.com, unplug December when you check out.

670
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,700
Alright, so let's shift gears.

671
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,940
Let's start, let's talk about Ubuntu Snappy.

672
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,820
So this was a topic of interest on this Sunday's Linux action show.

673
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,220
During the news, we brought on Dustin Kirkland from Canonical.

674
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,380
He's the Ubuntu cloud product manager and a strategist at Canonical.

675
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,500
And his new baby is Ubuntu Snappy Core.

676
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:14,900
Now just a super quick recap, Ubuntu Snappy Core is a new release from Ubuntu based, uses

677
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,900
system deep.

678
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,460
But what's actually more important is the base file system is tiny.

679
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,300
The base system is very small and it's read only.

680
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,060
When you get an update, you get a new instance of the file system.

681
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,820
And when you reboot, you boot into that new instance.

682
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,140
And if something doesn't work, you just choose the other one.

683
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:38,660
The applications are fairly unaffected because essentially they're isolated probably in containers.

684
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,140
And then when you can do these updates to the base system, you don't really affect the

685
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,600
application data, the version of the application, the libraries they depend on.

686
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,120
And if the update doesn't work, well it was a transactional update.

687
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,620
So it's easy to roll back to the past version.

688
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:58,320
So when Dustin was talking about this, I realized this would probably be a great way to have

689
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,240
a very secure and stable rolling desktop release.

690
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,220
So I asked him, is this the future of the Ubuntu project?

691
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,220
Potentially.

692
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:14,460
I don't know that it'll ever, we certainly haven't indicated that it will replace apps.

693
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,140
Maybe being offered on all Ubuntu platforms in addition.

694
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:22,140
Yeah, I think that's reasonable to say that anywhere you're doing Ubuntu, you can do either

695
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:28,700
the traditional Debian package app get update, app get upgrade, or the snappy.

696
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:34,940
I think that's a reasonable goal to shoot for.

697
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:40,980
Myself as a long time Debian packager and Ubuntu developer, there's certainly places

698
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:47,860
where I need to do Debian packages for the foreseeable future.

699
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,020
So I guess my last question for you, just as some jargon I want to help clear up for

700
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,020
the audience.

701
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:58,140
So we have your standard Debian packages, we have click packages, snappy packages, and

702
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,780
then there's also the management piece, which is called Juju.

703
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,060
How does Juju fit in with Ubuntu snappy core?

704
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,180
Can it be used to manage some of the services that might be riding on top of some of those

705
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,180
containers?

706
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:15,060
Yeah, so that's certainly on the longer term roadmap.

707
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:19,100
Maybe a little bit farther out, a few months to a year out.

708
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:26,900
Fundamentally, Juju is, as an orchestration tool, the goal of Juju is to create resources

709
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,300
in the public cloud, private cloud, or bare metal solution of your choice.

710
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:37,100
And Juju can create instances in Amazon, Google, Azure, as well as OpenStack on the private

711
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,100
side of things.

712
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,980
That instance would be like a full web stack with database ready to go, sort of like I

713
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,540
click this and I deploy this charm and it's my whole setup, right?

714
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,760
Yep, exactly.

715
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,500
And that one charm might be a bundle of charms.

716
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,580
It might not just be a single web app.

717
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,720
It might be a web app that depends on a database, which has to be configured in a cluster with

718
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,540
an HA proxy in front of it, a memcache on the side accelerating things.

719
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:07,620
By the way, you want to log everything to a single aggregator, an RSS log.

720
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:12,620
By the way, those logs you want to then pump into a big data solution, a Hadoop, and then

721
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,980
MapReduce that and be able to elastic search your logs.

722
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:22,380
That's a very typical Juju deploy one thing and it deploys all those services onto a dozen

723
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,020
different instances running in the public cloud, private cloud, or bare metal of your

724
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,020
choice.

725
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:33,420
Now, when Juju starts that instance, I would see Juju as being able to start that instance

726
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:39,260
as a traditional Ubuntu image or perhaps a snappy Ubuntu image where you've made the

727
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:45,940
opinionated decision that this suite of services you're going to deploy in that snappy, transactionally

728
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,940
upgraded model.

729
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:54,060
That is going to be a pretty compelling product offering altogether and it's a really interesting

730
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,060
space.

731
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:56,060
Containerization is bringing a lot of changes.

732
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,140
Dustin, is there anything else you want to cover, anything else you want to let us know

733
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,460
about Ubuntu snappy?

734
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,460
Come talk to us.

735
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,740
Snappy devel is a mailing list.

736
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,960
We've got an active community.

737
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,820
We released just two days ago, just on Tuesday, and we put out images in the first public

738
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,060
cloud, Azure.

739
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,860
The other public clouds will be coming along the next couple of weeks.

740
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:27,420
We published an initial image that you could play with in KVM and within six hours, we

741
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,420
had posts on the list of people contributing vagrant images and VMware images.

742
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:38,860
Personally, it caught me a little bit by surprise, not being a VMware, a vagrant user, that,

743
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:44,680
oh yeah, how we missed that, but fortunately we've got an active community developing very

744
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
quickly.

745
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:52,060
So, yeah, come help us fill the gaps, scratch your own itches in the snappy world.

746
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:58,340
A big thank you to Dustin for coming on the show and, Poppy, I couldn't help but notice,

747
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,340
oh, he left, didn't he?

748
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:04,580
Dang it, I couldn't help but notice on that video there, if you look closely, if you're

749
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:08,460
watching the video version, you'll notice right there on the page, big pull quote from

750
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,540
Microsoft, Microsoft loves Linux.

751
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,380
Boom, right there on the page.

752
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:18,300
Premier Azure, the launch partner for Ubuntu Snappy Core.

753
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,460
So he didn't seem to be too big on the whole Ubuntu Snappy Core for the desktop, but of

754
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,620
course he's the cloud guy, right?

755
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,220
He's focused on the server stuff.

756
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,900
So that makes sense.

757
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,500
I can't judge, I can't judge, but I'm looking forward to trying out Snappy Core.

758
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:38,820
We've got Snappy Core, Fedora Cloud, and CoreOS that are all kind of, Fedora Cloud though

759
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:44,780
doesn't, so what's different here is Ubuntu Snappy and CoreOS inherently, as part of their

760
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:50,060
product offering, sort of solve that, I gotta update the base OS, but keep the applications

761
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,060
isolated.

762
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:57,980
Fedora Cloud is more of a traditional OS, distro, but if you employ things like Atomic,

763
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,380
then you get more of that functionality.

764
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,960
That's kind of my rough understanding.

765
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,140
So it's really, it's an area that you've got really like three or four very clear different

766
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,700
attempts to solve this problem.

767
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,820
Some people would say it's fragmentation, but I think it's, we're gonna see which one

768
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,780
actually wins the race.

769
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:18,520
So anybody in the Mumba room have any thoughts on the interview before we move on to our

770
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,520
Fedora review?

771
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:26,180
I think it's great and I'm really, I'm looking forward, I'm paying attention, that's pretty

772
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,180
much it.

773
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,180
Yeah, I agree.

774
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:34,460
I think it's, I think what, where we're at right now is solving the I gotta patch a lot

775
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,280
and I don't want to break my apps problem.

776
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,240
That's where we're at today.

777
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:45,140
But what we're, where we're going to end up, I suspect at the end of all of it is this

778
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:51,060
is how you install a new application on Linux, period.

779
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:56,000
Now we're not, we're not anywhere near there yet, but I feel like what we are working towards

780
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,380
is the world's most amazing solution to solving that problem.

781
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,740
How do you install X on Linux?

782
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,980
I don't care what distro it is, how do you do it?

783
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,980
And it's going to be one answer and when it's going to take us, what we're going to document

784
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:17,220
on this show and it's going to take a long ass tedious time is the process of us going

785
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:22,020
from how do I update my rig all the time because man, I keep getting exploited.

786
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,500
That's where we're at today.

787
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:27,900
But what we're going to watch that transform into is that how do I install it on Linux?

788
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,220
And that's going to be an interesting journey for us to document.

789
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,300
I think it's going to take more than 70 episodes though.

790
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,300
Oh yeah.

791
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,300
I think so.

792
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,300
Yeah.

793
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,780
Well, I think everybody wants to get to the Fedora review and I agree.

794
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,940
I think Fedora 21 has been an amazing release.

795
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,820
We've talked a lot about it.

796
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,460
I hope the audience is okay with this deep diving like this because we've, we obviously

797
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,740
have been talking and this will be about the third week or in a row or so that we're talking

798
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,180
about it.

799
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:57,020
But I feel like when, when a Linux distribution that's at least as important as Fedora, but

800
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:02,380
any Linux distribution that has, that has as much of a wide reach that Fedora has, that

801
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,260
has many, that has as many contributors working for it that Fedora has and has the role that

802
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:12,840
Fedora has to go through what we've seen it go through, to split off into these three

803
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:18,780
distinctive flavors, to be, to be willing when you're, when you're at the size of Fedora

804
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:25,340
to just say eff it and just go for it and just do something totally different.

805
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,900
And then to pull that off, like I, I'm going to be honest.

806
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,900
I kind of thought when Fedora was talking about going with three flavors and doing it

807
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,940
in like essentially one release cycle, I was like, yeah, okay, well if you think you can

808
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,340
pull that off, good luck to you.

809
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,340
You know, really.

810
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,380
I mean, I was skeptical about it.

811
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,380
And now here we are.

812
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,380
Fedora 21 is released.

813
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,380
Yeah.

814
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,380
A little delayed.

815
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,380
No bigs.

816
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,620
And it, and they seriously did it.

817
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:51,620
So that's incredible to me.

818
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:56,820
And I think it might be one of the most interesting distribution related things has happened this

819
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,820
year.

820
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,980
Not just one, but one of them.

821
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,500
So we're going to get the community's input on that.

822
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,860
But first let's talk about our friends at Ting.

823
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,540
They're ending 2015 with a freaking bang.

824
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,540
Ting is mobile.

825
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,540
That makes sense.

826
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,540
My mobile service provider and Matt's linux.ting.com is where you go.

827
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:17,920
Let's represent for the Linux Unplugged show at the end of 2014 linux.ting.com.

828
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,920
So why Ting?

829
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,920
Why does it make sense?

830
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,920
What do I mean by that?

831
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,660
Well, first of all, no contract, right?

832
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,900
Because the contract, it just really doesn't make any sense.

833
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,980
But what also doesn't make any sense is paying into these plans that you may use plans like,

834
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,700
like it feels like insurance and I always kind of feel like that doesn't make sense

835
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,700
either.

836
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,840
Ting instead, it's just pay for what you use.

837
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,780
So it starts with $6 for the line.

838
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,780
That's all you pay.

839
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,180
And that's pretty straightforward.

840
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,180
I can afford that.

841
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,620
That's why I've got three of them, right?

842
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,900
Because what matters is what you actually freaking use.

843
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,840
So it's just your minutes, your megabytes, your messages.

844
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,800
They add them all up and that's what you pay.

845
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,140
If you want to turn on hotspot, that's fine.

846
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,140
Do it.

847
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,340
Make it, make it a wifi access point.

848
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,340
That's just data usage.

849
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,500
Just not a big deal.

850
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,180
And if you're savvy about using wifi, like when you're on wifi and you make your calls

851
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,500
over that, I mean you can have incredible savings with Ting because again, you're just

852
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,900
paying for what you use.

853
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,380
So linux.ting.com, start there, okay?

854
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,020
That'll get you $25 off your first Ting device.

855
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,820
If you have advice that's compatible, they have a bring your own device page where you

856
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,040
can check that out.

857
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,540
If you have a device that's compatible, well, they'll give you $25 of credits.

858
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,700
Well, the first month, like usually is like 26 bucks.

859
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,060
So you're going to get your first month pretty much for free.

860
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,420
If you have a contract, well, Ting's going to help you get out of that.

861
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,940
So you're going to get $150 for the line that you have to cancel.

862
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:34,140
Yeah, it's $150 in credits, but it's $150 in freaking credits.

863
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,700
That's money you won't have to pay for your cell service.

864
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,700
That's really great.

865
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,940
Plus, they have an awesome control panel.

866
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:44,660
You can call them at 1855-TING-FTW anytime between 8 a.m. or 8 p.m. east coast time.

867
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,940
Yeah, it's east coast time.

868
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,940
I'm sorry about that.

869
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,940
I know, I know.

870
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,940
It's not Pacific.

871
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,940
I'm sorry.

872
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,940
But it's east coast time.

873
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,240
The human being answers the phone.

874
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,240
That's okay.

875
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,740
So that's like boom.

876
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,820
That's the foundation of Ting.

877
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,240
You can already see they're thinking about this differently.

878
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,620
You can see they're trying to disrupt the crazy ass restrictive mobile industry.

879
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,860
Okay, that's pretty straightforward.

880
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:10,000
Well, what struck me about Ting is when they don't have to, when they don't gotta, they're

881
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,820
going out of their way to make their stance on issues clear.

882
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:17,380
They recently had a blog post about net neutrality that I thought was really well reasoned and

883
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,380
really well put together.

884
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,740
I thought, okay, I feel like my money's going to a good place.

885
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,740
They're coming here.

886
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,940
They're thinking about this rationally.

887
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,260
They're taking a stand.

888
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:30,980
They're articulating that stand really well, and I thought that's really cool.

889
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,420
They're screwing with the mobile industry by offering something totally different.

890
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:39,060
They're about to roll GSM and CDMA out at the same time starting in 2015, which is gonna

891
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,860
be a game changer.

892
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:44,900
I'm loving all of that, but let's be honest.

893
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,260
There's more that could be done, right?

894
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:53,300
Wireless is fundamentally critical to the future of a lot of mobile apps, a lot of mobile

895
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:59,460
web stuff, but at the end of the day, I still got that wired connection.

896
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,320
I cannot believe it.

897
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,680
This is what I love about Ting.

898
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,460
This is why I always preach vote with your wallet.

899
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,420
Ting is going to launch, and now they're starting small.

900
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:13,720
I mean, they have to start within reason, but they're going after residential internet

901
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,720
access now.

902
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,980
See, now this is just the beginning of something.

903
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,980
It's not a big thing.

904
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:20,580
It's only in one area right now because it's just like Google Fiber.

905
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:27,100
They gotta start small, but they're starting to roll out crazy fast fiber access to the

906
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:31,340
home, and they're gonna take the whole Ting model to all of it.

907
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:39,820
I think it's... This could be huge for everyone, like not just users of Ting, but everyone

908
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,860
on the internet.

909
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,460
They seriously care about this stuff, and again, that's why we talk about voting with

910
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,500
your wallet, linux.ting.com.

911
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Go there.

912
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,500
They got it on their blog.

913
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,500
You can read about it, but go to linux.ting.com first.

914
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,020
That way, we get credit for your visit, but then go over to their blog and check this

915
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,020
out.

916
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,020
They're rolling out fiber.

917
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:01,340
Unfortunately, it's like in Virginia right now, yeah, Charlottesville, Charlottesville.

918
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,400
I want it so bad.

919
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,940
This is so cool.

920
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,620
I think this is another example of a great sponsor that I'm really, really happy to have

921
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:13,220
because I really believe in what they're trying to do, and I think that's just so amazing.

922
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,980
I mean, they've already... For the last two years, it's totally changed the way I think

923
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,980
about mobile.

924
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:22,100
It's changed how I look at the whole industry, and now, I'm going to look at what they're

925
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,940
doing at residential ISP service.

926
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,500
This Ting is crazy, and I love it, linux.ting.com.

927
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,660
Go over there and check them out.

928
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,660
See how much you could save.

929
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,860
They have a savings calculator.

930
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:35,900
Check them out, linux.ting.com, and a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged

931
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,900
Show.

932
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,140
Okay, guys, so let's talk about Fedora 21.

933
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,140
Let's get started.

934
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,940
First up, get fedora.org.

935
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,940
It's their new site.

936
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:49,860
They're very proud of it, and you know what I find to be interesting on this site?

937
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:55,220
First sentence, Fedora is now more focused, and isn't that true?

938
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,700
Isn't that exactly what they've addressed in Fedora 21?

939
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,700
You've got your workstation release, your server release, and your cloud release.

940
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:08,940
Now, I think probably not a large leap of assumption here to consider.

941
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,320
We've probably all just been looking at the workstation release.

942
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,060
Not a lot of us looked at the server or cloud, right?

943
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:16,140
Anybody done any of the server or cloud stuff?

944
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,140
I didn't think so.

945
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,140
That's fine.

946
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,140
Maybe we'll do that in the future.

947
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,020
So let's start with Fedora workstation.

948
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:24,240
Go ahead and tag me in the mumble room, anybody that wants to start.

949
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,140
I'll begin with my experience, tell you what I did, and then we'll jump into the mumble

950
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,140
room.

951
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:38,980
So I installed Fedora 21 64-bit on my Bonobo and also on a Dell Sputnik laptop that was

952
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:44,380
sent to me by Colonel Linux in the mumble room, and I also tried it for about a half

953
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:50,900
hour on an Apple MacBook Pro 2013-ish.

954
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,920
I don't really know the model number.

955
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:59,540
So that was the range of hardware that I experimented with Fedora 21 on, all GNOME across the board,

956
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,860
because I decided to go with the environment that I was most comfortable with.

957
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,860
So let's start with Colonel Linux.

958
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:08,300
How was your experience on your laptop?

959
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,940
So I installed it on my Dell E6320, and that worked really great.

960
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:18,380
In fact, that's my new daily operating system now, is 21, and that worked really well.

961
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:23,940
But I had a nook that I used for doing different things, and that was when it first came out,

962
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,060
I wanted to throw it on something, and that was what happened to be laying around, and

963
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:28,060
it sucks.

964
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,840
The lock screen freezes up.

965
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,420
So like if I were to switch over to that computer right now, I have to hit escape like 15 times

966
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,100
and wait like 30 seconds, and it's running on an 840 Pro SSD.

967
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,380
So I shouldn't be waiting for it, but I do wait for it.

968
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:44,980
That doesn't happen in Ubuntu 14.4, so I don't know.

969
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:49,660
You know, I had my first like, oh my God, it's going to happen moment with Fedora 21.

970
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,820
I don't have these very often anymore with computers.

971
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,380
I guess it just doesn't happen a lot.

972
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:59,500
And Matt, it's kind of funny because it made me think of the monkey suit right away.

973
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,500
Of course.

974
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,500
Oh no.

975
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:09,140
I was on the Sputnik that Colonel Linux sent me that I've selfishly held onto.

976
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,380
Thank you, Colonel Linux.

977
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:16,540
And it's an Intel chip in the Sputnik, and I thought, well, so I'm all open source through

978
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,140
and through right now.

979
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,940
And at the GDM login screen, and you hit the little gear button, you have your GNOME desktop,

980
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:27,640
GNOME Classic, and then on there is GNOME and Wayland.

981
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:33,740
And so I chose GNOME Wayland, and I logged in, and then at first I thought, did it not

982
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:36,260
work?

983
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,500
I think it's still using X.

984
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,980
Like, and I launched like Terminal, I launched Chrome, I launched the activities overview.

985
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,180
I'm like, oh, I guess it didn't work.

986
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,100
And then I started to realize like a couple of things weren't working quite right.

987
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,740
Like my trackpad, like I couldn't click on stuff.

988
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:53,540
I could move the mouse with the trackpad, but I couldn't click on anything, and I couldn't

989
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:54,540
scroll.

990
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,960
But if I had a USB mouse, I could use that.

991
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,520
And I started to realize, oh, I actually, I actually, I'm using Wayland right now.

992
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:07,060
I'm using Wayland with GNOME 3 and the Chrome browser right now.

993
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:11,260
And I had this total like, oh my God, I'm using Wayland and it's working flawlessly

994
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,260
moment.

995
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,860
And like, it was amazing.

996
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:19,780
Like here we are, I keep saying this, the end of 2014, but I actually, I actually just

997
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:26,500
had like a essentially trouble-free Wayland desktop, no futzing, except for my trackpad

998
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,500
didn't work.

999
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,780
But it was, it was kind of like Fedora 21 was my first and it was like, oh wow, thank

1000
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,780
you.

1001
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:34,780
That was incredible.

1002
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:39,020
And now I know like it's ex-Wayland doing all the windowing stuff, but it was, it was

1003
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:40,020
kind of amazing.

1004
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:43,340
RA, I know you were here specifically to touch on Wayland.

1005
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,180
Do you have any comments on that?

1006
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,180
RA?

1007
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,180
RA.

1008
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:51,780
Oh, I'm sorry, RA, yeah, I'm sorry, RA.

1009
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:57,940
Yeah, actually I would like to announce that I'm running on Wayland right now.

1010
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:03,820
And I think I'm the first person in the chat room to talk while on Wayland.

1011
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,820
Is that true?

1012
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,820
Yeah, you might be.

1013
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:09,140
I think you are our first Wayland-based mumbler.

1014
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:12,820
And actually I had the same story like you, Chris.

1015
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,380
My trackpad doesn't work.

1016
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,380
And I had the same Wayland surprise.

1017
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:22,900
Like I tried Rebecca Black Linux, which was supposed to work out well.

1018
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:28,940
And also Fedora 20 and all those shenanigans, as Matt would say.

1019
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:33,700
And it didn't work and Fedora, suddenly I realized I was on Wayland and it didn't crash

1020
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,180
and it runs fine.

1021
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,180
Yeah.

1022
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,180
Yeah, it's pretty neat.

1023
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:41,540
I mean, it's not done, but it's pretty neat to see that happen.

1024
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:45,660
And I don't know, I mean, it's been a big discussion piece for a long time.

1025
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:50,220
So RA, I'm sorry, you'll be our Wayland correspondent, okay?

1026
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:53,420
You keep us updated on your Wayland developments, all right?

1027
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,420
Okay.

1028
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,420
All right, very good.

1029
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,420
Thank you.

1030
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,500
So any other comments from the Mumble Room on their Fedora 21 experience?

1031
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,500
I'll end it with this.

1032
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:06,460
And I was, I'm hoping maybe somebody can walk me back from the ledge.

1033
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:13,100
But I'm ready to declare Fedora 21 my next distro if I jump.

1034
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,100
I'm ready.

1035
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,100
Wow.

1036
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:16,100
I've never heard of it before.

1037
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,500
I mean, I'll give people, walk me back, walk me back from it.

1038
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:23,420
But I'm just right now, here's the thing, here's what's limiting, is the software availability

1039
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,240
still sucks.

1040
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,260
And I will, I also, before I go in this, have to acknowledge-

1041
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,580
How do you mean?

1042
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:36,980
Well, like, for example, Heropad, a Markdown editor, does not exist for Fedora.

1043
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:39,580
It's a total impossibility.

1044
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:40,580
It's a nightmare.

1045
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,620
I even tried building it from source and it ran like ass.

1046
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,800
It was a total nightmare.

1047
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,500
But if I'm on Ubuntu, I've got a PPA ready to go.

1048
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:51,780
If I'm on the Arch, well, of course, the AUR has got that ass a decade ago, it had that

1049
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,780
in there.

1050
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,780
200 years ago, it had that in there.

1051
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,380
But when I go to Fedora, I'm like in no man's land, right?

1052
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,380
Okay, Viber.

1053
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,100
Viber is another example.

1054
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,220
I don't like it.

1055
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:04,900
I admit it is a crap application that we should move away from, but I need it to correspond

1056
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,340
with people that are in the field and people that are out and about and, okay, Viber is

1057
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,340
a thing.

1058
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,340
You know what?

1059
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,760
If you're on Fedora, go screw yourself.

1060
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,200
You're on Arch, no problem.

1061
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,700
You're on Ubuntu, no problem.

1062
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,300
You're on Fedora, I hate you.

1063
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,260
That kind of stuff drives me crazy with Fedora.

1064
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:25,980
Whereas with Arch, again, I'm not saying this applies to everybody, but because I install

1065
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:30,060
four to five to six to seven to eight to 10 applications a week, that way I can pick one

1066
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:35,900
of those mother effers on the Linux Action Show, because I reinstall that many applications,

1067
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:41,980
like when I have to go out of my way to find a repo or download an RPM or build it from

1068
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:48,020
source, that adds 10 to 15 minutes, and if I'm doing five to 10 to those a week, that's

1069
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:53,380
stupid because in the AUR, nowadays, I just go packer-s and I just put the name of the

1070
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,060
damn package in there and I've got it.

1071
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:58,340
I don't even look to see if they've got it because they've got it.

1072
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:05,740
Now that's where Fedora falls short, which only probably applies literally maybe to me.

1073
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:09,880
There might not be anybody else in the world that that applies to, and I accept that.

1074
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,780
If that does not apply to you, I feel like Fedora's got most of it because Copper's got

1075
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,100
a lot of stuff.

1076
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:19,300
There's a lot of stuff in the RPM Fusion and additional repos around Fedora, and if we

1077
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:24,120
use scripts like Fedly, F-E-D-L-Y or whatever it is, it'll set up a ton of stuff for you

1078
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,380
under Fedora that makes it a pretty good setup.

1079
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:32,800
For me right now, Fedora 21, it's the longest setup.

1080
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:39,860
It's the most post-installation work, but the process of doing that is fairly automated,

1081
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:41,460
fairly easy.

1082
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:45,180
You can pretty much just do it, sit, click, click, click, and you're done.

1083
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:49,580
It takes a lot of work, but after that work's done, it's ready to go.

1084
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:53,260
If you start with something like Karora, which I don't think has their 21 release out yet,

1085
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:59,700
but Karora Linux, which is Fedora with all the goodies that are evil pre-built in, then

1086
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,900
it's even a quicker go.

1087
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,780
That's what I mean with Fedora 21.

1088
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:08,960
It's great with the exception that it does require a lot of work to get going.

1089
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,500
If you want Steam, you want proprietary drivers, you want Codex, you want Flash, you want Java,

1090
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:18,980
you know Chrome, you know that kind of stuff, it takes a while.

1091
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:19,980
That's fine.

1092
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:25,120
Yeah, I've definitely found that the one area Fedora doesn't quite do it for me is package

1093
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:30,900
availability because I do find myself needing either PPAs or AUR, something that has a little

1094
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:31,900
bit more.

1095
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,060
It's not even about being recent.

1096
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:38,020
It's just about me not having to compile it or dig through an RPM on an old ice or whatever.

1097
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,020
Yeah, I agree with you, Matt.

1098
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,020
I do.

1099
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,020
Rotten Corpse, go ahead.

1100
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:46,420
Yeah, I've actually set up my laptop to be the Fedora, so it's like my second distro

1101
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:52,540
choice now, but mainly because copper is one of the things I'm super excited about.

1102
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:57,260
Yeah, so can you kind of explain a little bit about copper because we've name dropped

1103
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,260
it.

1104
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,700
We talked about it on Sunday's Linux Action Show.

1105
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:05,060
Is it fair to say it's sort of an AUR arch user repository equivalent?

1106
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:14,780
Well, it's more of a PPA equivalent, so you can build different branches kind of thing,

1107
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,780
so the different packages.

1108
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:20,500
The only thing that I see so far that I don't like about copper is that it's restricted

1109
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,940
to open source free software type of stuff.

1110
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:30,940
So the reason you say that is because the building doesn't happen on the Fedora workstation

1111
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,500
when you install the package?

1112
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,500
Right.

1113
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,260
They set up the builds on their servers.

1114
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:37,260
Gotcha.

1115
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:42,220
Now, Dave, you wanted to comment on other desktops besides GNOME?

1116
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:49,060
Yeah, I'm just saying while GNOME is the default offering, it's not the only offering, and

1117
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:53,140
other desktops do work flawlessly on Fedora.

1118
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:58,220
If you're running Cinnamon, KDE, LXDE, whatever, don't expect to have problems.

1119
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:02,420
If not, something like Unity, you can only install that.

1120
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,260
Yeah, very true.

1121
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,940
In fact, Matthew Miller said that KDE is a very important desktop, as well as many of

1122
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:09,940
the others.

1123
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:13,980
Ra, you've been using the OpenSUSE build service with your Fedora installation?

1124
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:18,140
Yeah, and I found that it works really nice.

1125
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:20,880
Sometimes they provide Fedora packages.

1126
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,980
Sometimes the OpenSUSE packages work.

1127
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,820
It's been really smooth, but I agree that it's kind of hard.

1128
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:33,860
For example, I didn't get Eclipse to work until I found out that the dev tool that they

1129
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:37,980
bundle with the workstation actually works perfect for that.

1130
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:41,580
Well, I'll tell you, it is a pretty great service.

1131
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,820
Eric, I know that's something you're familiar with, right?

1132
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:44,820
Correct.

1133
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:51,860
I have used the OpenSUSE build service quite a bit, especially in OpenSUSE, to get stuff

1134
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,260
installed, find packages and whatnot.

1135
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:57,940
The only thing is they don't have Fedora 21 just yet.

1136
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:02,780
They probably will in the soon future, I would imagine, but they don't have the ability to

1137
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:06,140
build packages for Fedora 21 just yet.

1138
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:11,220
I'm looking forward to that because, for instance, the KDE Connect indicator, which has been

1139
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:16,740
our subreddit a couple of times, it can be installed on OpenSUSE.

1140
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:20,520
It's just not very successful, but it's built for Fedora 20.

1141
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,820
It works properly in Fedora 20.

1142
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:25,140
It just needs to be compiled for Fedora 21, and that'd be fine.

1143
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:31,180
You kind of went through the process of trying to submit that to the Copper...

1144
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,180
Is it repository?

1145
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:33,180
I'm not sure what to call it.

1146
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:36,380
Yeah, just Copper, I guess.

1147
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:38,380
I did, but the build failed.

1148
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:42,220
The build failed because it...Well, actually, no, the build succeeded.

1149
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,220
I apologize.

1150
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:44,220
The build succeeded.

1151
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:50,420
When I went to install, it failed to function, so I'm not exactly sure why that is.

1152
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:57,020
It does the same thing in OpenSUSE, so I imagine because they're in the Git sources, I think

1153
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:03,100
it is built more for Debian and Ubuntu than it is for anything else, so it's a matter

1154
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,420
of just making it compatible.

1155
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:08,000
I know there's people working on it in the Git repository.

1156
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:15,340
This is the hurdle that Fedora now has to overcome, is the Linux desktop market has

1157
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:21,740
moved on, and I don't mean to disparage Fedora, but in that sense, it is just simply so much

1158
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:28,260
easier to get some of that software for Ubuntu and for Arch.

1159
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:32,460
Two examples that are very popular, KDE Connect and Herupad.

1160
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:36,740
Herupad is an amazing markdown editor that is really gaining in popularity.

1161
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,620
We talked about it three or four months ago in the Linux action show, and they've just

1162
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,740
been blowing up since then.

1163
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:42,800
It's available for Ubuntu.

1164
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,800
It's available for Arch.

1165
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,860
It's not available for Fedora.

1166
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:50,140
Those are just isolated examples, but I believe that is Fedora's problem now.

1167
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:54,260
What they have done here, I think, has laid the groundwork to address that.

1168
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,260
Fedora workstation.

1169
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:59,520
I had a conversation with Michael Dominic on Monday's Coda Radio, where he's back on

1170
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:03,220
Linux now for his development workstation, and he was asking, if I reload, what should

1171
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,220
I switch to?

1172
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:09,200
And I made a pitch for Fedora, because honestly, they've got dev assist.

1173
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,780
They're really close to upstream.

1174
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,060
That's one of the things I've always said about Arch that I liked a lot, is I felt like

1175
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:14,340
I'm closer to upstream.

1176
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:21,200
Well, Fedora's got that, but it also has that background leadership by Red Hat, which I

1177
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,740
believe, at the end of the day, to have a commercial entity that says, you know what?

1178
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,740
We've got to produce something here.

1179
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,060
We've got stuff we've got to do.

1180
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:31,820
I think that actually is just what it takes to prevent issues like we've just seen with

1181
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:35,940
Debian, but it's not where they're directly pulling all of the strings.

1182
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,340
I think it's just the right mix.

1183
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,680
I like that about Fedora, right?

1184
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,220
From that perspective, I enjoy it.

1185
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:45,860
The fact that they're all in with Gnome, I think that really makes it a great Gnome experience.

1186
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:49,460
The dev assist stuff, all of that, I think, actually makes it a pretty compelling developer's

1187
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,020
workstation, just like they've been pitching it.

1188
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:58,460
So when he asked me, what should I use for my Linux workstation, honestly, I gave a harder

1189
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:08,180
pitch for Ubuntu Mate 14.04, but I said, with that considered, Fedora 21 is a serious, serious

1190
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:09,180
contender.

1191
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:17,780
And if you've watched me over the years, you know how I've felt about Fedora, right?

1192
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:23,260
If you look at some of our shows from five years ago, compared to what I'm saying about

1193
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:26,740
Fedora today, they have turned it around, I think.

1194
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:28,020
Oh, I agree.

1195
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:29,140
I definitely agree with that.

1196
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:34,140
I definitely like the direction they're going with everything, except software availability.

1197
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:36,740
Everything else is honestly blowing everyone else out of the water.

1198
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:37,740
Yeah, nailed it.

1199
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:38,740
You nailed it.

1200
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:39,740
That's exactly it, in a nutshell.

1201
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:40,740
That's exactly the...

1202
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:46,640
And the software availability is slowly improving, and it actually is going in the right direction.

1203
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:47,640
So it's pretty cool.

1204
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,140
And I think that'll probably button up our coverage of...

1205
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,140
Oh, go ahead.

1206
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:55,380
Yeah, I just have a word of clarity that KDE Connect works flawlessly in Fedora under KDE,

1207
01:00:55,380 --> 01:01:00,420
however using the KDE Connect indicator, which is for other desktop environments, it doesn't

1208
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:02,180
work quite so well.

1209
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:09,380
Also the chat room has been asking, and Colonel Linux, you'll be happy to hear.

1210
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:13,380
So I tried out Fedora 21 on a MacBook.

1211
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:17,180
It does not go to graphical environment at all if you have a second monitor hooked up

1212
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:23,500
over the Thunderbolt adapter, but if you are just doing a single monitor, everything except

1213
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:29,540
for...I didn't try the webcam or wireless, but Bluetooth, Thunderbolt, Ethernet works.

1214
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:34,700
But what was really impressive is it not only supports the retina display on the MacBook,

1215
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:39,420
but GNOME looks pretty good.

1216
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:47,860
Chrome and Firefox, the text is really small, but the GNOME UI itself, I don't have a lot

1217
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:54,620
of experience with retina display, but it was amazing.

1218
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:56,620
Look at GNOME on that resolution, it looked great.

1219
01:01:56,620 --> 01:02:00,020
I think you could fix the remainder of your problems just by...I think what the problem

1220
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:03,180
is is it conflicts with the existing Mac OS operating system.

1221
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:09,180
I think if you were to take that off, I think then everything would work fine.

1222
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:13,140
So anyways, I was kind of flabbergasted.

1223
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:17,140
It's the first time I've ever just put a thumb drive into a MacBook Pro, booted it up, and

1224
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:21,260
actually had Linux working on it, and able to use the networking and all of that.

1225
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:22,900
So there you go.

1226
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,740
I am very impressed with Fedora 21.

1227
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:28,620
Ww, why don't you give us your closing thoughts on your experience with Fedora 21?

1228
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:33,860
Well, I'm going to have to preface it with saying I tried it on seven-year-old hardware

1229
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:36,740
and I thought, oh, it's Linux, it should work.

1230
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:44,820
And I ran into issues where I could just not install for the life of me, no matter what.

1231
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:46,140
Oh, really?

1232
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,140
Yeah.

1233
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:50,860
I mean, I'm running it on an AMD.

1234
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:54,780
It's my other laptop, not my main laptop.

1235
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:59,340
It's an AMD 2 gigahertz dual-core with an NVIDIA 6150.

1236
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:05,140
And it just, after like, when it went to format the drive and install, I left it there for

1237
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:07,060
like two hours.

1238
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:11,700
And you were doing text snap at the time, and by the time that was over, I'm still waiting

1239
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,700
for the system to run.

1240
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:13,700
Now that's a long time.

1241
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:14,700
Yeah.

1242
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:15,700
Yeah.

1243
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:23,860
I did want to, for the most part, from what I experienced of the install, it kind of reminded

1244
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:31,380
me of that Windows feel where it had a good level of polish, but I still felt it had some

1245
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:36,700
work to be done, like the warnings could be up higher for when you're trying to install

1246
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,700
something.

1247
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:40,180
Well, actually, pause right there just for a sec.

1248
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:44,260
I was actually kind of impressed with the way that they brought forward the SE Linux

1249
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:49,580
alerts, and would tell you, here's what SE Linux has detected.

1250
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:54,500
Here's like three or four fairly solid options you can do to resolve this problem.

1251
01:03:54,500 --> 01:04:00,940
I thought A, that was impressive, and B, YUM or DNF, like I added the Dropbox repository

1252
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:06,900
for Fedora before it was ready, and what YUM does, when you do a YUM update, and then the

1253
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:13,140
Dropbox repo 404s, because they don't have anything set up for 21 yet, instead of YUM

1254
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:19,380
essing the bed, what it does is it says, hey, bro, I'm having troubles contacting this repo,

1255
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:24,100
you can run this command to disable the repo, or you can run this command and just say,

1256
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:28,340
you know what, ignore it when it 404s, it's no bigs.

1257
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:33,660
It's just enough power, but yet enough hand holding, that when you're new to YUM or DNF,

1258
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,340
you know what to do next.

1259
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:41,560
Having some basic Linux knowledge and system administration knowledge, okay, admittedly

1260
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:46,620
more than basic, but that was enough, the information they provided me, I was able to

1261
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:52,380
take actions based on that and resolve my SC Linux issues, and resolve my YUM repo issues,

1262
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,220
and I thought it was really slick the way they handled it.

1263
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:57,020
So are you talking about that, WW, or are you talking about something else?

1264
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:04,700
No, no, I feel like my issue was more like a hardware incompatibility issue, or maybe

1265
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:10,900
I needed to throw a switch on some setup script, or when it booted off of the USB stick to

1266
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:17,180
do something, but I got no such prompt at all during the process.

1267
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:24,380
I know Poppy felt the same way about a certain issue with how the setup was for partitioning,

1268
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:27,040
and I thought it was confusing, and he did as well.

1269
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,700
I don't know if he had some further thoughts on that.

1270
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:32,060
Thank you for bringing that up too.

1271
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:36,820
I did feel like, while the overall installer, it's growing on me, they've had this essential

1272
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:42,080
one for a little while now, I felt like, so every time I was installing Fedora 21 on every

1273
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:47,380
rig I installed it on, because it's 2014, I already had an operating system installed,

1274
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,380
right?

1275
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:49,380
It wasn't a blank drive.

1276
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:56,120
I don't know in what scenario somebody's installing Fedora on a system that's never had another

1277
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:00,100
operating system, but it probably happens in the server space and stuff, I'll grant

1278
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,100
them that.

1279
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:06,340
But on the desktop, what Fedora tries to do is it's going to hook you up.

1280
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:11,020
It doesn't want to mess with you, so it's going to shrink stuff, and it's going to try

1281
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:14,460
to fit Fedora in some free space for you.

1282
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:15,780
But I don't want it to do that.

1283
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:20,920
I want it to wipe out all the partitions and set up, have at it Haas, go for it Fedora.

1284
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:25,020
In order to get to that, you've got to select the drive, and then you've got to go into

1285
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:30,940
the special reclaim space menu, and then you've got to select the partitions that you're willing

1286
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:38,060
to reclaim space from, and then when you click that, it doesn't actually represent in the

1287
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:40,940
visual that you're now reclaiming that space.

1288
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:45,460
It's not until you click apply that it then represents it, so you don't really get a chance

1289
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:48,740
to visualize what it is you're about to do before you make the action.

1290
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:51,180
And the entire time, you're not even sure that's where you're supposed to be making

1291
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:52,260
that change at.

1292
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:57,980
And so I felt like the partitioning definitely was one of the rougher areas, but once I wrapped

1293
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:02,380
my brain around what they were trying to do, every subsequent Fedora install, I didn't

1294
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:04,380
have a problem.

1295
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:05,380
Yeah.

1296
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:10,820
I did try it on another laptop, and I think it worked better, so I think I might just

1297
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:16,900
try a different USB stick and put some space and give it a better try on another system

1298
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,820
and see how it turns out for me.

1299
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:22,580
Ra, you had some ButterFS experience feedback?

1300
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:23,860
Yeah.

1301
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:31,860
Actually I had a preview set up with OpenSUSE, and there were a couple of ButterFS partitions

1302
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:38,780
on there, and then I decided to go all in on Fedora 21 even before it came out.

1303
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:42,900
And that's not happened since I ditched Windows, let me tell you.

1304
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:48,420
And Fedora, just the partitioning scheme, the editor, messed it up.

1305
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:55,420
Then I had 20 ButterFS partitions, which all were empty sub-volumes, in the partitioning

1306
01:07:55,420 --> 01:08:01,220
editor, and it actually created all those, and I thought, well, let's do it.

1307
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:03,500
Maybe it's just a bug.

1308
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,380
And then it actually created all those.

1309
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:10,500
But that was before the release, and they fixed that, so it should work right now.

1310
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,500
I hope it does.

1311
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:12,500
Yeah.

1312
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,500
All right.

1313
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:16,540
And Dave, you have a better way for the partitioning?

1314
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:19,700
Yeah, there are simpler ways to actually do it.

1315
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:22,460
You just simply delete the partitions.

1316
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:28,580
The thing about Fedora 21, and most Fedora installs since, I think, the new installer,

1317
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:32,820
it doesn't actually write changes to your disk until you begin the installation.

1318
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:34,020
Right, okay.

1319
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:40,860
So you can make changes whichever way you want by just simply adding and deleting disks

1320
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:42,660
and deleting partitions.

1321
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:48,100
When you actually get to the partition menu, which I admit is a little confusing at first,

1322
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:53,340
but you just press the little minus sign on the bottom and your partitions will be gone,

1323
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:57,540
and you can write whatever new configuration that you want, any way you want it.

1324
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:58,780
So there is that.

1325
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:05,180
Secondly, to WWE NSX's point, I would like to ask him which spin he was using, because

1326
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:11,780
if he was installing Gnome Tree or something heavy, it might take a very long time, because

1327
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:18,740
a default Gnome Tree install has, I think, somewhere around 1400 packages to install,

1328
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:25,340
from the core utilities to all of the Gnome stuff, so obviously it would take a while.

1329
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:28,380
The advantage, obviously, is that it doesn't download stuff from the internet, so you can

1330
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:29,380
do it offline.

1331
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:30,380
Right.

1332
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:35,540
I also, before we go any further, I just want to make a caveat that Dave, his audio is a

1333
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:37,220
little crackly.

1334
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:40,660
He's been experiencing some problems under Linux, when he boots into Windows, the crackle

1335
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:41,660
goes away.

1336
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:44,980
So we're troubleshooting that, so we apologize, but you know, it's what happens sometimes

1337
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:45,980
as Linux users.

1338
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:47,980
All right, so WWE, did you have a response to that?

1339
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:55,820
Yeah, I just grabbed a workstation ISO 64-bit off of Fedora's site and just downloaded it,

1340
01:09:55,820 --> 01:10:01,460
put it on the USB drive and just ran it.

1341
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:07,540
What I think happened is the whole system locked up, because my mouse was movable, I

1342
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:12,300
was just letting it sit and just format the partition, and at one point it just became

1343
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:19,500
immovable and I left it until I thought, I'm going to have to hard reboot, and it just

1344
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:25,620
froze on the formatting of the drive, so that's what happened for me.

1345
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:29,420
Then obviously, yeah, that was probably an installer bug, that happens from time to time

1346
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:30,420
to the best of us.

1347
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:31,420
Yeah, is that true?

1348
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:35,380
It happens with every disher out there, you have to be careful about that.

1349
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:39,580
Bugs happen from time to time to the best of us, Raw, you have our closing thought you

1350
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:41,700
wanted to say?

1351
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:43,260
Yes.

1352
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:47,180
Go ahead.

1353
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,340
Go ahead, you have it sir.

1354
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:50,340
No?

1355
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:51,340
All right.

1356
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:56,320
Oh yeah, I'm there, sorry, I didn't push.

1357
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,700
So the Budgie desktop, I'm not sure whether you tried it out, but it's on, it's big on

1358
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:05,700
Google+, they have a great community, and it's actually quite a good desktop, I wouldn't

1359
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:09,540
prefer it over GNOME 3, but that's just because I'm used to it.

1360
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:12,700
Is it Fedora based, or what's it based on?

1361
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:14,500
It's GTK based, it's GNOME based.

1362
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:18,700
Right, yeah, I know that, but what's the underlying distro that it's based on?

1363
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,060
Yes, Fedora, I think.

1364
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:26,740
I don't know what it's based on, but it's at least easily installable on Fedora, just

1365
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:27,980
to add a repo file.

1366
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:28,980
Yeah, very good.

1367
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:31,540
All right, that's another check it out.

1368
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:34,380
Every now and then, as the holidays come up from time to time, some of you have a little

1369
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:37,940
extra time on your hands, some of you don't, if you're like me, especially with the three

1370
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:38,940
kids.

1371
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:42,420
Tell you what, Matt, I want to move to Texas, I'm going to set up the JB Ranch, I'll have

1372
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:47,260
all of the hosts come down, they can live on the ranch, I'll be like George Lucas, and

1373
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:50,060
all of it is just so that way when the family calls up and they're like, hey, are you coming

1374
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:51,060
to Christmas?

1375
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:54,940
I'll be like, oh yeah, you know what, sorry, gosh, I'd love to come to Christmas, but you

1376
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:57,720
know what, I'm in Texas, yeah, I'm in Texas.

1377
01:11:57,720 --> 01:11:58,720
That's what I want to do, Matt.

1378
01:11:58,720 --> 01:11:59,720
What do you think?

1379
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,620
Well, you know what would be cool, is when bacon's ready, you could just ring a bell,

1380
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:02,620
right?

1381
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:03,620
Yeah.

1382
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:06,620
And all the hosts come, like, heads pop up out of the kennel, you know, it's like, come

1383
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:07,620
running in.

1384
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:10,540
And all the hosts, all the producers, that would get some stuff done.

1385
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:11,860
I think that's a great idea.

1386
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,380
Well, maybe we'll work that out in 2016.

1387
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:18,420
In the meantime, go over to Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact and send us your feedback, it's

1388
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,660
a huge part of the Linux Unplugged show.

1389
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:24,260
Also linuxactionshow.reddit.com is where you go to give us your feedback.

1390
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:27,420
If there was something like, God, why didn't these guys talk about this, these idiots?

1391
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:32,700
Well, it's probably because you didn't submit it to our subreddit, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1392
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:35,860
Also go over there to Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1393
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:39,140
We won't have a live show next week, but we will have a new show, but we need your best

1394
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:41,860
of submissions, we're still taking those.

1395
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:43,900
Check it out, we need your help.

1396
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:48,140
Next week we'll have a new episode of sorts, it'll be some of our best of stuff with some

1397
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:50,740
moments from me mixed in there.

1398
01:12:50,740 --> 01:12:54,620
So Matt, have a great Christmas, and I'll see you in two weeks, okay?

1399
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,620
Sounds good, see you then.

1400
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,180
All right everybody, thank you so much for tuning in to this week's episode of Linux

1401
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:59,180
Unplugged.

1402
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:27,620
We'll be right back here in two weeks.

1403
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:41,180
I totally, I totally want to mess with Texas.

1404
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:42,180
Great show.

1405
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:45,140
That was a good show, great end of year, well of course it's not the end of year, we have

1406
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:46,700
one more show in us.

1407
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:49,620
But I feel like this is the last show of the year in a sense.

1408
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:54,140
The next show, it's like a, I don't know what it is, it's like a freebie.

1409
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:55,660
But thanks everybody, it was a great input.

1410
01:13:55,660 --> 01:14:01,060
So JBTitles.com, we gotta go boat, boat, everybody go over there right now.

1411
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:05,500
One thing I'd just like to say, everything you talked about, think about YUM, and YUM

1412
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:11,700
has its flaws, let me tell you that, but think about YUM, think about SELinux, the installer,

1413
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:16,340
everything has worked perfectly fine since Fidelity 18.

1414
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:18,500
Yeah, right, thank you.

1415
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:23,740
I didn't mean to imply that the SELinux alerts and stuff, and the YUM stuff was new to 21.

1416
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:29,620
I didn't, so you know, I sometimes assume people know that, and so I don't disclose

1417
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:34,020
that, and really what I was trying to say is, it's part of the overall experience now

1418
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:37,300
on 21 is you have all of that stuff combined with everything else.

1419
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,300
Yes, so.

1420
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:43,940
No, the thing is YUM sucks, YUM is a god damn, and coming from me that's saying something.

1421
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:44,940
Oh!

1422
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:48,460
I don't know, I mean it didn't seem that bad, of course I was mostly using DNF, it didn't

1423
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:49,460
seem that bad.

1424
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:52,780
Yeah, no, you have to, god damn.

1425
01:14:52,780 --> 01:15:00,660
So I can see it on the internet, that I do not like YUM as much as I like the app.

1426
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:04,620
That being said, there are certain advantages, and these advantages have been there for a

1427
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:05,620
very long time.

1428
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:08,980
I haven't tried using DNF.

1429
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:14,060
I have, I have a couple of times, it's YUM, it's what YUM should have been.

1430
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:18,860
I like Lord Wimpy as one of our title suggestions, that's pretty good considering that Wimpy

1431
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:19,860
is so badass.

1432
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:25,380
Fedora 21 frags, Misconceptions is a little long.

1433
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:26,380
That's not bad though.

1434
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:29,420
It's a little long.

1435
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:30,420
Like my opinion.

1436
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:32,900
I'm sorry, it has a little nod to, is it not?

1437
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,260
Yeah, I do like that aspect of it, I do agree.

1438
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:38,700
Steam's winter is coming, ww, you know where my head's at.

1439
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:43,060
Wifi enabled micro-brew, that's right Token Ring, paying attention.

1440
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:45,060
Chris' bacon farm down in Texas.

1441
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:46,060
Bacon farm?

1442
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:51,460
I had a question for Wimpy as well, does his remote cloud top work with the brewery?

1443
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:52,460
The brewery?

1444
01:15:52,460 --> 01:15:53,460
What is it called?

1445
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:54,460
Sure it does.

1446
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:55,460
Sure it does.

1447
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,460
The brewery?

1448
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:57,460
The brewery, I think it is?

1449
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:58,460
The brewery, yeah.

1450
01:15:58,460 --> 01:15:59,460
I have no idea.

1451
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:00,460
If you buy me one, I'll test it.

1452
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:01,460
Yeah, there you go.

1453
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:02,460
All right, so.

1454
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:03,460
I can see that becoming popular.

1455
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:04,460
Christmas is coming.

1456
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:05,460
Houses.

1457
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:10,620
I don't mean to over-hype this, but I think we are currently experiencing a title crisis.

1458
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:14,020
This is the title crisis of 2014 Winter Vortex Edition.

1459
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:17,060
I don't like any of the titles in the top five ranking right now.

1460
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:19,540
I need everybody to go to JBtitles.com.

1461
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:20,660
This is a crisis.

1462
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:21,660
This is a crisis.

1463
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,940
You are entitled to your wrong opinion.

1464
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:24,940
I'm entitled.

1465
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:25,940
Hey yo.

1466
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:29,780
Hey Wimpy, I like your, what did you call it, cloud top computing, what did you call

1467
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:30,780
that?

1468
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:32,660
Yeah, link bait, that's what that was.

1469
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:33,660
I know, but that was good.

1470
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:34,660
That was good.

1471
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:37,300
Yeah, cloud top computing, yeah.

1472
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:40,580
You know, it reminded me, I was on Tech Talk today, I was telling on the pre-show, I was

1473
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:45,700
telling a story about five or six years ago, I worked at a school district.

1474
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:48,940
And not only did they have abysmally slow internet, but they also had really restrictive

1475
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:51,660
filters, content filters, as you might expect.

1476
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:55,180
But to the point of where it made it hard to even do some IT troubleshooting and things

1477
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:56,180
like that.

1478
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:59,540
Because certain open source projects were flagged, and it was really, even like I think

1479
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:02,380
for a time, Jupiter Broadcasting was flagged.

1480
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:04,100
But this was five or six years ago, right?

1481
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:07,840
This wasn't really in the era of digital ocean droplets anymore.

1482
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:13,900
And so I had a friend who had a data center down in Texas, and he gave me a co-located

1483
01:17:13,900 --> 01:17:14,900
server.

1484
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:15,900
It was like an Optron box.

1485
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:19,340
I think it had two Optron processors in it, and about 16 gigabytes of RAM.

1486
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:24,460
And it was a Red Hat Linux, I think it was Red Hat Enterprise something old.

1487
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:32,300
And it was a full-fledged like real PC server, like it wasn't a VM, it was a full racked

1488
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:39,100
box that I was getting for about $120 to $135 a month, including an NFS-attached storage

1489
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:42,180
array that I had for like big stuff, which was really cool.

1490
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:46,500
And what I did back then, and I know I think we've talked about this before, Wimpy, is

1491
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,060
I didn't use X2GO, which is what you're using.

1492
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:52,460
I use something called No Machine NX or MX.

1493
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:53,460
Do you remember this?

1494
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:54,460
Yeah.

1495
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:58,020
Yeah, well that's what I'm using at work at the moment, and I'm about to replace with

1496
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:59,020
X2GO.

1497
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,020
Yeah.

1498
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:05,260
So from what my experience is with No Machine, again it goes over SSH, it uses pretty good

1499
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:08,260
compression, it can even do like remote sound.

1500
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:12,700
You know, I mean it was amazing for me because I essentially had like a Gnome 2 or XFCE style

1501
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:19,260
desktop, and I could even watch YouTube videos, 20, 30 frames per second maybe if I was lucky,

1502
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:22,780
and the audio would be synced up, and it was extremely, extremely usable.

1503
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:26,940
I would close the window, my session would just remain, I would reconnect, I would resume

1504
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,220
right where I left off.

1505
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:31,220
So what is the main advantage of X2GO over, say, No Machine?

1506
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:34,100
Because No Machine is still a thing too.

1507
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:39,500
Yeah, X2GO is just blitzing quick and lighter weight.

1508
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:47,260
So the core implementation takes about 35 meg of RAM, and when you actually connect

1509
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:53,140
to a full Ubuntu Mate session, you can run it in 125 meg of RAM.

1510
01:18:53,140 --> 01:19:01,220
And doing that over, I use FreeNX currently with Ubuntu 10.04, we're about to ditch that

1511
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:09,980
and update, but that uses about twice the RAM, and that's where FreeNX, which is the

1512
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:13,620
open source implementation of No Machine.

1513
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:17,160
So yeah, but like you say, you've got all of that good stuff like transparent audio

1514
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:24,300
relay, so your audio transparently shifts from the remote instance to your local instance.

1515
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:25,300
Yes, it's very exciting.

1516
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:29,620
And yes, you can watch SD video from YouTube and what have you.

1517
01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:35,860
But where X2GO starts to differentiate itself is you've got this transparent shunting of

1518
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:41,100
your directories from your local machine to the remote machine, which all happens over

1519
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:48,300
SSHFS, and you just right click, share a folder, pick a folder, and then boom, it appears on

1520
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:52,180
the desktop as a mounted drive on the remote instance.

1521
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:55,860
Would you be up for doing a segment with us on last, like in January sometime on that?

1522
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:57,440
Because that is really cool.

1523
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,820
The file system set up like that is definitely very neat.

1524
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:01,820
I'd love to show people.

1525
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:02,820
I can.

1526
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:06,300
I tell you what, maybe we'll want to wait a little bit longer, because since I posted

1527
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:10,920
about that, I've been talking to DigitalOcean, and I'm now working with their editorial team

1528
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:16,460
to turn this into a proper tutorial.

1529
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:20,980
So there's going to be several articles, and I was talking about this in the lobby with

1530
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:25,780
some of the other guys prior to the stream starting.

1531
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:29,140
So we're going to do the initial recreating what I've done.

1532
01:20:29,140 --> 01:20:35,420
So as an individual, you can create a droplet and deploy a desktop into it, and I'll explain

1533
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:38,460
what the potential use cases for that are.

1534
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:44,100
But then taking it full circle, what we're going to be looking at is if you're a small

1535
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:52,220
business and you want to control your distributed workforces computing environment, and you've

1536
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:57,900
got to bring your own device policy, how you can set up centralized authentication for

1537
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:03,180
these multiple instances, and you know what your fixed costs are per employee per month.

1538
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:08,100
It's going to cost you 10 bucks a month for a workstation instance, which they can connect

1539
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:12,220
to from a Mac machine or a Windows machine or a tablet or whatever.

1540
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:16,080
So just to hold on, just to put you on pause, are you telling me that what you're working

1541
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:21,740
on is a way to take somebody, say, that has multiple droplets that are desktop instances

1542
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:26,540
that they connect to where they have a secure place to work, but they would all also have,

1543
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:30,420
maybe like on the private networking side, a centralized login system, like an open

1544
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,900
ELD app or something?

1545
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:36,660
Precisely that on the centralized authentication side, but also building on DigitalOcean's

1546
01:21:36,660 --> 01:21:44,300
private networking, the end game is once you've got central authentication and multiple instances

1547
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:49,780
on a larger droplet, deploying Open Media Vault and using the private networking to

1548
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:52,620
create a virtual distributed office.

1549
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:54,220
Oh my gosh.

1550
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:55,860
That is brilliant.

1551
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:58,300
Yeah, of course.

1552
01:21:58,300 --> 01:21:59,780
Oh wow.

1553
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:01,280
Of course you could do that.

1554
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:04,180
That is so slick.

1555
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:06,300
That is, that is, I want to do that.

1556
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,300
I want to do that.

1557
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:08,300
Nice.

1558
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:09,300
Right, Matt?

1559
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:10,300
You know what I'm saying?

1560
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:13,420
That's like, when you hear that, you're like, wait a minute, okay, hold on, who needs computers

1561
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:14,420
anymore?

1562
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:15,420
I'm just going to build droplets.

1563
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:18,020
I'll have an Open Media Vault rig up there.

1564
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:19,020
Seriously?

1565
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:20,020
I'll have a Plex rig up there.

1566
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:21,340
I'm going to do this.

1567
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:22,340
That is wimpy.

1568
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:23,680
You've got to tell us how that goes.

1569
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:24,680
That's really cool.

1570
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:27,140
It changes the economics of everything, really.

1571
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:28,140
Quite.

1572
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:33,220
And what I've got here, what I've been experimenting with is there are a number of thin client solutions,

1573
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:37,420
and we were talking about some of those earlier, but the one I'm using is I've got a Raspberry

1574
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:42,260
Pi with, in fact, you know about this, Chris, because Q5Sys gave you one, a Raspberry Pi

1575
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:46,340
with an Atrix lap dock, and then a wireless dongle.

1576
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:52,260
The whole thing runs wirelessly off the internal battery for 10 hours, and I've got a minimal

1577
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:58,420
arch instance on that Raspberry Pi, which boots to open box, automatically starts the

1578
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:06,820
X2Go client, and then I log in to my remote Ubuntu MATE droplet, and as far as my workstation

1579
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:13,060
is concerned, I've got a full Ubuntu MATE workstation, far more powerful than the Raspberry

1580
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:15,020
Pi I'm using to connect to.

1581
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:17,860
No kidding.

1582
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:23,900
Talk about taking a Raspberry Pi and just making it, essentially, a transparent shim

1583
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:30,260
between you and the remote system that has potentially a huge connection, super fast

1584
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:31,260
SSD.

1585
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:32,260
That is wimpy.

1586
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:33,260
Geez, that's cool.

1587
01:23:33,260 --> 01:23:37,860
And a Raspberry Pi is like a super cheap version of this, but when you look at these deployments

1588
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:45,100
that are happening where Windows is being replaced with a Linux desktop, it's not being

1589
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:48,620
replaced with a Linux desktop on that Windows machine.

1590
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:54,580
By and large, they are remote terminal services, and that Windows machine is being repurposed

1591
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:56,060
as a thin client.

1592
01:23:56,060 --> 01:24:03,060
So this is how you can bridge that gap and minimize your hardware expenditure.

1593
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:08,780
This pushes so many buttons for me, because remote desktops used to be something that

1594
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:14,500
not only did I... So I took what was once the largest independent bank here in Washington,

1595
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:19,700
which is no longer the case after 2008, but we moved them from DOS to terminal services.

1596
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:23,500
But then I went to school districts and did Linux terminal services project.

1597
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:27,100
And then when I was working for the school district, I did the no machine thing for myself.

1598
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:31,620
And what you're talking about right now is so up my alley.

1599
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:35,700
It is like my bag, so I really want you to keep me updated on this, because I would love

1600
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:38,500
... Not only would I love to just talk to you about this, but I would love to even show

1601
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:43,940
people how to do this, because this could be seriously a way to show people that watch

1602
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:49,980
the Linux action show, a very straightforward, very cost-effective way to build out a remote

1603
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:51,940
Linux-based desktop.

1604
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:56,260
Doesn't matter if all of their employees want to have Macbooks and iPads and iPhones.

1605
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:57,260
That's fine.

1606
01:24:57,260 --> 01:25:01,620
But when you log in to do the work, you log into our secure environment under control,

1607
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:05,980
under our control, up in the cloud, connected over private networking to our internal resources.

1608
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:06,980
Exactly.

1609
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:12,360
And that solves your bring your own device IT governance problem right there, and your

1610
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:16,820
file format compatibility problem with Mac users with one version of Microsoft Office

1611
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:23,300
and Windows users with another Microsoft Office version, and it just solves all of that.

1612
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:24,740
Wow, that's slick.

1613
01:25:24,740 --> 01:25:25,740
Wow.

1614
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:29,660
And the other piece, a little bit further out, because this is in the unstable branch

1615
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:36,100
at the moment, and I mentioned it a few weeks ago, but there's a bolt-on protocol for ExtaGo

1616
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:44,900
called Telekinesis, and that's a general purpose protocol, but it was really developed to facilitate

1617
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:46,820
a mTeleplayer.

1618
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:53,380
So now what you can do is you can have full HD content on the remote instance, and instead

1619
01:25:53,380 --> 01:26:00,540
of using the ExtaGo protocol to send the rendered video, it actually streams the video back

1620
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:05,020
to your remote machine, but in a window, and it looks like it's being rendered on the remote

1621
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:08,500
machine, but it's not, it's actually the video's being streamed.

1622
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:15,580
So I'll just go off and find a little video, there's a video of two full HD screens running

1623
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:18,860
a 4K video over ExtaGo and mTeleplayer.

1624
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:19,860
No, no.

1625
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:23,780
Yeah, I'll just go and find it, it's on YouTube, hang on a sec, I'll be back, I'll be back

1626
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:24,780
in a bit.

1627
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,580
Wow, that is amazing.

1628
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:32,020
This feels like we're getting like ice cream with our pie, and getting like double scoops.

1629
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:35,940
So you guys know I've been trying out this touch screen for a little bit.

1630
01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:41,180
And it's pretty solid, surprising, it's surprisingly good.

1631
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:47,500
I'm happy overall with the picture quality, one thing that I have noticed is, you know,

1632
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:53,560
it's like the things you don't expect, I guess thinking about it, when I got this monitor,

1633
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:59,140
my plan was to fix up one of the old hackintoshes that I used to use as the switcher, it's a

1634
01:26:59,140 --> 01:27:02,420
pretty nice hackintosh, and I thought, alright, I'm going to fix this up, I'm going to make

1635
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:07,340
it an arch box, and then I'll put that under the table, and I'll take the Bonobo home.

1636
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:11,820
Because, you know, I bought it to be able to do quite a heavy video load, so it's still,

1637
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:15,340
even though it was a couple of years ago, it still makes a pretty good, like, just dedicated

1638
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:17,020
GNOME workstation.

1639
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:21,580
And I would just have that hooked up to the Dell monitor and the other mirrored port going

1640
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:24,540
out to the HDMI capture.

1641
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:28,100
But you know, it needs some work, it needs like some data has to be backed up off of

1642
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:33,740
it, and it needs fans replaced, and it just has, like, stuff that has to be done to it.

1643
01:27:33,740 --> 01:27:35,380
It just, I'm not getting to that.

1644
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:39,980
So I realized, well, you know, this Bonobo here, this frickin' Bonobo's got HDMI out,

1645
01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:43,020
display port out, and a built-in screen.

1646
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:47,380
I've always wondered, as long as I've owned the Bonobo, would the Bonobo be down for a

1647
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:48,980
three-way monitor hookup?

1648
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:52,820
I've never, you know, I've always been a little cautious about, I didn't want to approach

1649
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:57,100
the Bonobo and be like, hey, Bonobos, I got this idea, and then the Bonobo would be like,

1650
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:58,620
are you serious?

1651
01:27:58,620 --> 01:28:03,540
When my HDMI port is full, that display port is off, buddy, that is off limits.

1652
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:06,380
But it turns out, it actually works great.

1653
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:11,020
I plugged in both the display port and the HDMI port, they're filled up now, and the

1654
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:17,260
internal screen's also on, and it works magically, I mean, it really works well.

1655
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:23,780
The downside though, and I'm running the latest Nvidia driver here, but from time to time,

1656
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:30,660
you know, about seven, eight days in, the driver just starts crapping itself.

1657
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:34,540
I don't know what exactly is going on, because usually it seems to happen right after I get

1658
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:37,200
done playing a full-screen video.

1659
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:43,820
And then the X session drops, GNOME restarts, well, the X session comes back, GNOME restarts,

1660
01:28:43,820 --> 01:28:47,460
fairly gracefully, everything actually kind of resumes, you know?

1661
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:51,820
All my apps are still running, it's not like a full jump out, it's more like something

1662
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:53,020
just changes.

1663
01:28:53,020 --> 01:28:58,540
And I go back to the default X layout, I no longer am in a three-way, I'm now back to

1664
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:03,300
one monitor, and then two remote displays, well that immediately breaks capture.

1665
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:09,820
And the thing is, if I'm playing a full-screen video, there's like a 98.9% chance that I'm

1666
01:29:09,820 --> 01:29:13,380
actually in the middle of a show, because that's why I'm playing the video.

1667
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:18,220
So that means my whole session takes a crap in the middle of a show, and the only way

1668
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:23,220
to fix it is if I get up and walk away from the microphone, and I walk around the table,

1669
01:29:23,220 --> 01:29:27,060
and I go over to the Bonobo, and I go there and I bring up the NVIDIA control panel on

1670
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:32,860
the Bonobo's display, and I mirror everything again, and then I walk back.

1671
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:35,460
So it's been a bit of a bumpy ride because of that.

1672
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:39,500
So the touchscreen, on its own, has been pretty solid.

1673
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:45,460
The unexpected consequence, though, of forcing my video card into a three-way has been not

1674
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:49,700
so stable drivers that seem to impact me about seven or eight days, just about the time you

1675
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:53,880
forget the problem even exists, and think it's maybe not going to happen again, BOOM!

1676
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:57,640
It gets you right in the middle of a, I don't know, unfilter, and then Rekai has to fix

1677
01:29:57,640 --> 01:29:58,640
it in editing.

1678
01:29:58,640 --> 01:29:59,640
That happened.

1679
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:00,640
Um.

1680
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:03,640
Have you considered using a different desktop environment?

1681
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:04,640
Pfft!

1682
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:05,640
No!

1683
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,640
Cri...

1684
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:17,420
Cri...
