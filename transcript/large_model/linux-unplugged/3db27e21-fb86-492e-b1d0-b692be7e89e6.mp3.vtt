WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.240
Wes's buddy, Leonard Pottering, the creator of Pulse Audio

00:03.240 --> 00:07.720
and SystemD, says that we should popularize image-based OSes

00:07.720 --> 00:11.320
with modern security properties built around immutability,

00:11.320 --> 00:17.040
secure boot, TPM2, adaptability, auto-updating, factory reset,

00:17.040 --> 00:21.600
and uniformity deployed via images.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.680
And they've updated SystemD to help start this.

00:25.680 --> 00:27.700
It's kind of like creating a Chrome OS-like update

00:27.700 --> 00:29.600
or a Silverblue-like update process.

00:29.600 --> 00:33.600
SystemD sysupdate automatically and atomically updates

00:33.600 --> 00:36.800
the host OS, container images, portable service images,

00:36.800 --> 00:37.960
or other sources.

00:37.960 --> 00:41.720
And of course, you get a new config file, sysupdate.d.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.520
I think you might be a fan of this.

00:43.520 --> 00:44.440
You're pro images.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.800
I am pro images.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.280
I know it's funny because I'm going

00:48.280 --> 00:50.680
to be like the devil's advocate guy, I think,

00:50.680 --> 00:51.720
this week on the show.

00:51.720 --> 00:54.320
And so I guess I'm starting early.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.560
I think this is a great idea.

00:55.560 --> 00:57.960
I know it's probably not going to get adopted

00:57.960 --> 01:02.640
by maybe anybody but Fedora and a few enterprise distros.

01:02.640 --> 01:05.800
But the idea is you always have a known good OS partition

01:05.800 --> 01:07.800
available that you can boot into.

01:07.800 --> 01:12.440
And you could have a scenario where perhaps SystemD is taking

01:12.440 --> 01:16.440
care of the A-B image stuff and making sure you've always

01:16.440 --> 01:18.220
got a working base image.

01:18.220 --> 01:20.940
And then your favorite distributions package manager

01:20.940 --> 01:23.700
is taking care of applications and stuff like that.

01:23.700 --> 01:26.380
You could have a world where these two things coexist.

01:26.380 --> 01:27.840
It does seem especially nice.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.880
It's probably going to do a better job than the sort

01:29.880 --> 01:31.640
of sketchy bash script I might write

01:31.640 --> 01:32.800
if I was trying to do this myself,

01:32.800 --> 01:34.000
say, with Arch or something.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.160
So in that sense, I'm for it too.

01:36.160 --> 01:36.800
I could see it.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.720
I mean, look it.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.080
Other OSes are getting these features.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.480
It's about time, right?

01:41.480 --> 01:42.560
It's about time, Linux.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.320
Come on.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.880
Let's not patch this one out.

01:44.880 --> 01:46.200
Let's try it.

01:46.200 --> 01:46.880
Give it a go.

01:46.880 --> 02:00.480
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

02:00.480 --> 02:01.120
My name is Chris.

02:01.120 --> 02:01.920
My name is Wes.

02:01.920 --> 02:03.520
And my name is Brent.

02:03.520 --> 02:04.600
Hello, gentlemen.

02:04.600 --> 02:05.320
Hello.

02:05.320 --> 02:06.480
Nice to see you.

02:06.480 --> 02:07.860
Well, guess what?

02:07.860 --> 02:10.520
Linux just landed support for something

02:10.520 --> 02:15.080
called software-defined silicon, kernel-level support

02:15.080 --> 02:18.800
to enable or disable a built-in CPU feature.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.320
As in, the CPU ships with all the features,

02:21.320 --> 02:23.440
but only certain ones get turned on,

02:23.440 --> 02:27.080
depending on what the user has or hasn't paid for.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.240
Intel can issue a license.

02:29.240 --> 02:31.680
It's coming in the next generation of systems.

02:31.680 --> 02:35.280
And Linux is already getting support for it as of this week.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.720
And as you can imagine, we've got a whole range of thoughts

02:38.720 --> 02:39.240
on this.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.360
So we'll dig into that.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.480
And then we'll round out the show with some boosts, some picks,

02:43.480 --> 02:44.360
and more.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.280
So before we get any further, let's

02:46.280 --> 02:48.480
say time-appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

02:48.480 --> 02:49.920
Hello, Mumble Room.

02:49.920 --> 02:50.560
Hello, Chris.

02:50.560 --> 02:51.440
Hello, Wes.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.080
And hello, Brent.

02:53.080 --> 02:54.080
Hello.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.520
More and more folks showing up in the quiet listening

02:56.520 --> 03:00.880
and just getting a free software version encoded in Opus

03:00.880 --> 03:02.120
straight from our mixer.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.720
We can't hear you, but we see you.

03:03.720 --> 03:04.320
We see you.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.960
And I'm going to give that another mention this week,

03:06.960 --> 03:10.040
because we have a project that I think we're going

03:10.040 --> 03:12.400
to work on after the show.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.680
And I think Mumble could be an option that's

03:14.680 --> 03:17.120
more viable for people who like low-latency versions

03:17.120 --> 03:19.840
of the stream, because we may be changing things up and going

03:19.840 --> 03:21.960
to a peer-to-peer system in the future.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.200
More on that.

03:23.200 --> 03:28.320
So our Mumble is the best way to get absolutely low-latency,

03:28.320 --> 03:30.920
high-quality audio, and you can get in that quiet listening.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.160
And if you want to move into the lobby and chat with us,

03:33.160 --> 03:35.580
or the on-air area, I should say, you totally can.

03:35.580 --> 03:40.200
So you can get the details at linuxunplug.com slash Mumble.

03:40.200 --> 03:43.560
And then we do the show live on Sundays at noon Pacific,

03:43.560 --> 03:46.360
3 PM Eastern over at jblive.tv.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.780
And we'll have more details to share on that kind of stuff

03:48.780 --> 03:50.080
coming up in the future.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.620
This week, though, we wanted to talk

03:51.620 --> 03:53.800
about this software-defined silicon that

03:53.800 --> 03:58.380
is landing the support that's coming in Linux in 5.18

03:58.380 --> 04:00.820
and is probably something that's going

04:00.820 --> 04:03.320
to be a huge topic in tech circles,

04:03.320 --> 04:05.640
I would imagine, within a generation or so of Intel

04:05.640 --> 04:07.160
processors.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.680
We touched on a lot of the details in Linux Action News

04:09.680 --> 04:11.560
this week.

04:11.560 --> 04:14.080
And we got some feedback in our matrix room

04:14.080 --> 04:16.160
that it was probably worth bumping this

04:16.160 --> 04:19.260
to a wider discussion because it seemed that people were not

04:19.260 --> 04:22.160
aware that this was a thing that was even coming.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.760
And we haven't talked a lot about it

04:23.760 --> 04:27.120
because we didn't want to sound like the sky was falling.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.000
We didn't want to sound to the alarm

04:29.000 --> 04:31.600
that the next generation of Intel CPUs

04:31.600 --> 04:34.560
are going to have essentially feature DRM,

04:34.560 --> 04:39.040
and Linux is totally supporting it

04:39.040 --> 04:40.520
because it's the capability to do it.

04:40.520 --> 04:41.360
It's all free software.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.040
It's all GPL.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.040
That's right.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.480
This is a tricky spot.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.480
And so we thought, let's talk about what it is so you guys

04:46.480 --> 04:47.760
have the right context.

04:47.760 --> 04:50.240
We're not going to hype it up or anything like that.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.720
We're just going to talk about what software-defined silicon

04:52.720 --> 04:53.480
is.

04:53.480 --> 04:56.080
And LWN has a good write-up, too, that we'll link to.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.320
But can you give us, I don't know,

04:57.320 --> 04:59.520
the highlights that you think we should probably know, Wes?

04:59.520 --> 05:02.760
Yeah, so software-defined silicon, or SDSI,

05:02.760 --> 05:04.440
if you want to be hip and abbreviate it,

05:04.440 --> 05:08.480
is kind of, as you say, it's a quote unquote feature that

05:08.480 --> 05:11.160
lets Intel ship some hardware capabilities that have to then

05:11.160 --> 05:13.200
later be enabled.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.760
A little more technical, it appears

05:14.760 --> 05:16.920
as a device on your system that offers

05:16.920 --> 05:18.920
a couple of new operations.

05:18.920 --> 05:22.480
One is to install an authentication key certificate

05:22.480 --> 05:25.000
or a capability activation payload.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.540
But basically, you have a certificate

05:26.540 --> 05:28.640
that is then used to verify the requests that

05:28.640 --> 05:30.240
are contained in the payload.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.440
And the idea being here that you've

05:32.440 --> 05:35.200
bought this chip or some piece of hardware,

05:35.200 --> 05:36.600
it has a base set of features.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.060
And then if you want to enable those additional features that

05:39.060 --> 05:41.940
are kind of hidden behind this new SDSI capability,

05:41.940 --> 05:44.240
you have to go talk to Intel in some capacity to pay them

05:44.240 --> 05:44.720
a fee.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.520
Maybe it's a recurring monthly fee.

05:46.520 --> 05:49.280
We don't really have details yet on what exact features this

05:49.280 --> 05:52.200
is going to be used to gate or how you're going to get access

05:52.200 --> 05:53.280
to them process might be.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.760
Yeah, is it going to be like they issue you

05:55.760 --> 05:58.160
a package that writes the files to these places

05:58.160 --> 05:59.960
now that these devices are on your system?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.400
Or is it some service that's calling home

06:01.400 --> 06:02.800
to their cloud service?

06:02.800 --> 06:03.760
I don't know.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.200
The stuff in the kernel is really just the bare bones

06:06.200 --> 06:08.840
stuff so that user space can make it work at all.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.480
That's how the nuts and bolts of it work.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.720
From an implementation standpoint,

06:13.720 --> 06:15.680
it's sort of almost perfectly Linux.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.660
It's you drop a file in a directory

06:17.660 --> 06:21.080
that the file says yes, no, properly licensed,

06:21.080 --> 06:24.120
and then another one that is the actual license.

06:24.120 --> 06:29.160
And then there's code in the CPU that verifies those files,

06:29.160 --> 06:31.380
verifies the functionality request,

06:31.380 --> 06:33.760
and then either turns it on or turns it off.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.880
It's really at this point kind of up in the air

06:35.880 --> 06:37.680
how all of that's going to work.

06:37.680 --> 06:40.440
But of course, the kernel team isn't necessarily

06:40.440 --> 06:43.520
looking to block this kind of stuff.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.120
There's not a whole lot of arguments

06:45.120 --> 06:48.760
that can be made against denying this.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.240
It's GPL software.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.160
It's just adding a couple of devices.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.600
It simply enables another piece of functionality

06:54.600 --> 06:56.680
in the upcoming CPUs.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.220
And the kernel community hasn't made a practice

06:59.220 --> 07:01.200
of rejecting this kind of stuff for other devices

07:01.200 --> 07:03.360
out there that do this that are maybe not CPUs.

07:03.360 --> 07:03.880
Right.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.280
Yeah, I mean, there's all kinds of weird gadgets

07:06.280 --> 07:08.440
or proprietary things that end up running Linux,

07:08.440 --> 07:10.520
even if it's in a data center that I'm never

07:10.520 --> 07:12.640
going to have access to or hardware I'm never going

07:12.640 --> 07:13.940
to be able to purchase outright.

07:13.940 --> 07:15.200
So this is what's coming.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.640
It landed in 5.18.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.280
It's going to be probably a little while

07:18.280 --> 07:20.160
before you get it trickled down to your distribution

07:20.160 --> 07:21.040
for most of you.

07:21.040 --> 07:22.720
I am using it right now, though.

07:22.720 --> 07:23.960
Actually, let me double check.

07:23.960 --> 07:27.880
But I think, yeah, I have 5.18.0 installed on this machine.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.000
You hipster, you.

07:29.000 --> 07:29.720
I love it.

07:29.720 --> 07:30.840
And this is an Ubuntu box.

07:30.840 --> 07:33.280
I'll tell you how I did that later in the show.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.560
So my system hasn't broken.

07:35.560 --> 07:37.640
In fact, when Linus announced this release,

07:37.640 --> 07:39.080
he was pretty low key about it.

07:39.080 --> 07:42.480
And he's like, yeah, pretty minor update.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.200
Nothing really too big in here.

07:44.200 --> 07:48.000
I think his words were, nothing's too surprising.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.880
Maybe not too surprising for you,

07:49.880 --> 07:53.440
but I don't think most of the community realizes that we're

07:53.440 --> 07:56.560
just kind of laying down and letting this stuff land

07:56.560 --> 07:57.520
in the Linux kernel.

07:57.520 --> 07:57.920
Yeah, right.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.760
I suppose his commentary is more on the like,

07:59.760 --> 08:02.260
oh, there's no crazy new subsystem or radical change,

08:02.260 --> 08:04.080
or we didn't suddenly enable Rust everywhere.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.040
Yeah, no wild bug.

08:06.040 --> 08:06.880
Yeah.

08:06.880 --> 08:07.560
Right, yeah.

08:07.560 --> 08:08.800
That kind of stuff.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.920
So it's just sort of unceremoniously went out.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.600
And there was really no red flags,

08:13.600 --> 08:15.080
like because Linus didn't say, hey,

08:15.080 --> 08:16.680
this is the one that includes the Intel.

08:16.680 --> 08:17.880
You may not want to upgrade.

08:17.880 --> 08:19.260
Yeah.

08:19.260 --> 08:21.760
So it was just sort of a low key release.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.520
We'll link to LWN, which has thoughts on this

08:24.520 --> 08:25.760
before it came out.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.800
And we'll also link to the actual original patch

08:27.800 --> 08:29.240
conversation.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.120
I'm also not quite clear on the parties involved here,

08:32.120 --> 08:35.680
because it seems to be that the parties introducing the idea

08:35.680 --> 08:39.320
is a developer from Red Hat working on behalf of Intel,

08:39.320 --> 08:42.400
even though Intel has plenty of kernel engineers on their own.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.960
But so there is some relationship with this

08:44.960 --> 08:45.800
there as well.

08:49.520 --> 08:52.000
Linode.com slash unplugged.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.600
That's where you go to get $100 in 60-day credit

08:54.600 --> 08:55.520
on a new account, and that's where

08:55.520 --> 08:57.080
you go to support the show.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.940
I love getting to talk about Linode.

08:58.940 --> 09:00.840
This is my moment every single week,

09:00.840 --> 09:02.920
and I really appreciate it, because there's always

09:02.920 --> 09:04.040
something to talk about.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.760
How great is that?

09:05.760 --> 09:08.160
And Linode really has been our secret sauce.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.840
I was just thinking about this morning.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.780
There's a project I'm working on.

09:11.780 --> 09:14.880
Of course, I'm going to Linode to deploy this thing, right?

09:14.880 --> 09:18.720
And I realized sometimes it's like I just pop off a server

09:18.720 --> 09:20.520
super quick, and I get up and working,

09:20.520 --> 09:23.720
and I probably have the thing done in two minutes.

09:23.720 --> 09:26.280
And then sometimes, sometimes I sit here,

09:26.280 --> 09:28.520
and I really think, how am I going to build this?

09:28.520 --> 09:29.880
What do I want to do?

09:29.880 --> 09:32.800
What should we use on the back end to deploy it?

09:32.800 --> 09:34.760
Because Linode works with all of that stuff too.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.760
So if you like to just do a one-click deploying, get up,

09:36.760 --> 09:38.580
and running really easy, you can.

09:38.580 --> 09:40.400
But if you want to tie it in with some infrastructure

09:40.400 --> 09:43.560
management, maybe do a little Terraform and some bulk,

09:43.560 --> 09:45.220
yeah, Linode supports all of that.

09:45.220 --> 09:47.160
You see, they've been around for nearly 19 years,

09:47.160 --> 09:49.360
and in that time, they figured out

09:49.360 --> 09:53.280
what features are worth spending energy and effort on,

09:53.280 --> 09:56.240
and which features are just silly platform features

09:56.240 --> 09:57.680
that are checking a box.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.400
And their mission has remained unchanged in that 19 years.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.280
Make cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible

10:03.280 --> 10:04.340
to all.

10:04.340 --> 10:07.400
And that really has led to the best-in-class experience.

10:07.400 --> 10:11.280
Support, performance, flexibility, 11 data centers

10:11.280 --> 10:12.240
around the world.

10:12.240 --> 10:15.280
In that time, they became their own ISP.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.400
You know what I'm saying?

10:16.400 --> 10:18.680
It really pays off over time.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.160
And now, we just get a great experience

10:21.160 --> 10:23.880
as customers with the best support in the business

10:23.880 --> 10:25.140
backing it all up.

10:25.140 --> 10:27.400
And of course, I'm taking advantage of their object

10:27.400 --> 10:31.720
like a maniac these days, powerful DNS manager.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.320
And the bottom line matters, right?

10:34.320 --> 10:37.200
Pricing 30% to 50% cheaper than all the major cloud providers

10:37.200 --> 10:38.600
out there.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.720
And you get Linode's great support, great performance,

10:41.720 --> 10:44.080
and you get a member that's friendly to our community.

10:44.080 --> 10:47.440
Somebody who plays nice, who buys local.

10:47.440 --> 10:49.680
So go try them out, support this show,

10:49.680 --> 10:52.200
and get $100 to really kick the tires.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.480
Go to linode.com slash unplugged.

10:54.480 --> 11:01.640
So let's talk about the moralities of this software

11:01.640 --> 11:02.920
defined silicon.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.200
And really, if the free software community

11:05.200 --> 11:07.520
should be taking a stand here.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.560
Because you could make the argument, perhaps,

11:09.560 --> 11:11.760
that Linux is big enough and relevant enough

11:11.760 --> 11:15.200
for enough market segments, not just the server,

11:15.200 --> 11:18.520
that if we put up a hard stand and said,

11:18.520 --> 11:21.940
no, this is a free software platform.

11:21.940 --> 11:23.600
It's not just the license that's free.

11:23.600 --> 11:28.480
It's about making something for people that is forever, right?

11:28.480 --> 11:30.640
It's about creating something that's

11:30.640 --> 11:32.580
for the general good, for humanity.

11:32.580 --> 11:36.040
It's not a tool for corporations to have successful platforms,

11:36.040 --> 11:37.200
although it can be.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.280
It's free software.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.640
It's GPL software.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.760
It's code for the people.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.080
And it should be commons.

11:43.080 --> 11:46.920
And so when we add things that restrict functionality,

11:46.920 --> 11:48.960
it's sort of inherent to the spirit of what

11:48.960 --> 11:50.200
we're trying to do here.

11:50.200 --> 11:53.160
Maybe it's not against the law of the GPL.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.160
It's definitely against the spirit of the GPL.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.920
That's, I think, the big argument being made.

11:57.920 --> 12:00.000
I think I'll play devil's advocate on this one.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.640
And I'm going to take Intel's side.

12:01.640 --> 12:03.960
Because I think I actually could make an argument for why

12:03.960 --> 12:05.440
it could be a good thing, too.

12:05.440 --> 12:08.360
But I'm curious, Brent, because Wes and I

12:08.360 --> 12:11.760
have dug into this a lot for Linux Action News.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.080
I know you caught that coverage.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.120
And you're coming at this with some information.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.120
But it's newest to you right now.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.240
So I'm curious what your impressions are

12:19.240 --> 12:22.760
on just the moralities around software-defined silicon

12:22.760 --> 12:26.560
being able to turn CPU features on and off through Linux.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.520
I'm looking forward to hearing your perspective

12:28.520 --> 12:32.880
as the Intel spokesperson in this hour.

12:32.880 --> 12:36.200
My initial sort of internal gut reaction

12:36.200 --> 12:40.960
is that it feels like a really slippery slope, or it could be.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.600
Is it going to lead to subscriptions

12:42.600 --> 12:45.240
for all your hardware, you know, like five years down the road

12:45.240 --> 12:48.120
where you're very, very hampered with what

12:48.120 --> 12:50.760
you can do with the stuff you, quote unquote, own?

12:50.760 --> 12:54.000
And thus, you are limited because you're not paying them

12:54.000 --> 12:55.600
on a monthly basis or whatnot.

12:55.600 --> 12:58.000
That is the first thing that comes to mind for me

12:58.000 --> 12:59.960
and is a bit of a scary perspective.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.240
Locking features up behind a monthly subscription.

13:02.240 --> 13:02.840
Well, that's it.

13:02.840 --> 13:07.000
I mean, we're subscriptionifying everything these days, it seems.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.120
And the last sort of thing that we have that's our own

13:11.120 --> 13:13.600
is the hardware that we've purchased or come by.

13:13.600 --> 13:17.160
And it seems to me like it would be a darn shame

13:17.160 --> 13:19.120
to see that go away and to have it

13:19.120 --> 13:21.560
be sort of like the Peloton model,

13:21.560 --> 13:23.520
and they can take it away from you anytime.

13:23.520 --> 13:27.280
That's my initial sort of reaction when I hear this.

13:27.280 --> 13:31.600
I could definitely accept that from a business point of view,

13:31.600 --> 13:33.240
it probably makes a lot of sense.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.840
They're creating the same chips for a whole bunch

13:35.840 --> 13:40.600
of different sort of, as you might say, models of their CPU.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.060
But for them, it's much, much easier

13:42.060 --> 13:43.520
to do the manufacturing and stuff.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.360
So I could see that point of view.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.000
I love that we're talking about this

13:47.000 --> 13:49.560
because it's not an easy answer, is it?

13:49.560 --> 13:53.760
Not as black and white as it might be on Windows

13:53.760 --> 13:55.280
or on the Mac platform.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.940
This might just be par for the course.

13:56.940 --> 14:00.680
But here, we kind of are the beacon of freedom

14:00.680 --> 14:02.880
in the software world, Linux is.

14:02.880 --> 14:06.120
And where does that freedom, where

14:06.120 --> 14:07.620
do we draw the line on that freedom?

14:07.620 --> 14:11.120
And what role does Linux have on protecting that freedom?

14:11.120 --> 14:16.680
Because we've pushed this until the breaking point with Nvidia.

14:16.680 --> 14:19.640
We just kept dogmatic at the issue.

14:19.640 --> 14:22.280
The kernel team is currently pushing this

14:22.280 --> 14:24.080
to the breaking point with ZFS.

14:24.080 --> 14:26.520
They will just not relent on that.

14:26.520 --> 14:31.080
There are some hills they are just willing to die on.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.160
Why not this hill, Wes?

14:32.160 --> 14:34.160
And should they be dying on this hill?

14:34.160 --> 14:35.440
Well, you're the devil's advocate, huh?

14:35.440 --> 14:37.240
I don't think we've heard your position yet.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.360
You've got me to do your work for you over there.

14:39.360 --> 14:44.080
No, my take on why is a little more cynical.

14:44.080 --> 14:47.200
I think it's because Intel is an influential partner,

14:47.200 --> 14:49.560
a major code contributor, and because the code they

14:49.560 --> 14:50.760
are contributing is GPL.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.000
But I'm curious if there's a moral obligation there.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.080
Yeah, I mean, it does make us ask some questions

14:55.080 --> 14:57.760
around the relationship with Intel.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.680
It's not even just some random provider.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.360
This is a company we like to laud

15:01.360 --> 15:03.160
as sort of doing open source and working

15:03.160 --> 15:04.520
with the kernel the right way.

15:04.520 --> 15:08.240
So you can see if the kernel were to take a stand here,

15:08.240 --> 15:10.800
I mean, that could really affect the way Intel

15:10.800 --> 15:11.960
is used to doing business.

15:11.960 --> 15:14.160
It seems like they are willing to do that model.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.520
They've adopted to that model.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.280
So then having to sort of, would they start shipping their own?

15:18.280 --> 15:21.240
Or would we be booting into FreeDOS

15:21.240 --> 15:22.760
to sort of load these certificates

15:22.760 --> 15:24.080
or doing some other, you know?

15:24.080 --> 15:26.080
Would the alternative be that this would still

15:26.080 --> 15:28.280
have to happen until it would keep moving forward?

15:28.280 --> 15:29.840
It would just be a worse interface

15:29.840 --> 15:32.000
to do so because you couldn't do it as easily directly

15:32.000 --> 15:32.760
with the kernel.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.160
Yeah, I guess we don't know.

15:34.160 --> 15:37.160
It seems like with the dominance of the x86 world

15:37.160 --> 15:40.720
and the popularity we see amongst developers

15:40.720 --> 15:43.200
and Hollywood production shops, Intel

15:43.200 --> 15:46.520
would have to be pressured into at least a few workstation

15:46.520 --> 15:48.160
and consumer line Intel chips, too,

15:48.160 --> 15:49.760
that were functional enough.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.440
But here's the devil's advocate's position,

15:52.440 --> 15:53.760
I think, for doing this.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.480
And I don't know if I fully buy it,

15:55.480 --> 15:58.960
but this is where I think Intel's coming from.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.160
And because, Brent, you touched on it,

16:01.160 --> 16:05.640
there are real genuine economies of scale when it comes here.

16:05.640 --> 16:09.720
And we've seen how screwed up chip manufacturing has gotten

16:09.720 --> 16:11.080
in the last couple of years.

16:11.080 --> 16:14.120
And so if there is a way for Intel

16:14.120 --> 16:17.840
to create a chip at one price point

16:17.840 --> 16:21.080
that they can then make millions of,

16:21.080 --> 16:25.000
and that makes it possible to actually meet demand, supply

16:25.000 --> 16:27.760
demand, and that makes it possible to sell at price

16:27.760 --> 16:31.960
points that give us devices that are like Chromebooks in cost

16:31.960 --> 16:34.440
or give us high-end workstation devices,

16:34.440 --> 16:37.040
depending on what people are willing to spend, I get it.

16:37.040 --> 16:39.240
I mean, it also helps Intel maximize revenue.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.800
But having a company that's making good revenue,

16:42.800 --> 16:45.080
there's one of the few American-owned companies.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.840
I'm just going to throw that in, too.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.040
Maybe that's a good thing.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.920
While also, they reduce the amount

16:49.920 --> 16:52.320
of different testing surfaces they have,

16:52.320 --> 16:54.880
so perhaps the products become more reliable.

16:54.880 --> 16:58.140
And it also means that you could buy something today

16:58.140 --> 17:01.800
for a cheaper price, like a $300 laptop or something

17:01.800 --> 17:02.680
like that.

17:02.680 --> 17:05.260
And then later on, you could add another feature,

17:05.260 --> 17:07.880
like maybe you could turn on virtualization for $80

17:07.880 --> 17:09.000
or something like that.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.680
And it means customers who have minimal needs

17:11.680 --> 17:14.160
but are very price-sensitive could technically

17:14.160 --> 17:16.480
get access to something that later on could

17:16.480 --> 17:18.720
become more advanced as their skill set becomes more

17:18.720 --> 17:19.760
advanced.

17:19.760 --> 17:23.960
So it really opens up the world to a whole new price point,

17:23.960 --> 17:26.520
and it gives a whole new stability and production

17:26.520 --> 17:27.900
pipeline for Intel.

17:27.900 --> 17:31.080
And we've seen in the last few years how important that is.

17:31.080 --> 17:31.840
It is just a shame.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.240
It feels like we're going backwards in some ways.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.760
It makes me think of the whole stuff

17:34.760 --> 17:37.780
with getting your Pi codecs in place

17:37.780 --> 17:39.040
and just what a pain.

17:39.040 --> 17:40.000
It's all fine, right?

17:40.000 --> 17:40.640
You can do it.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.320
You can run the right scripts or figure it out.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.800
But just practically, it sucks.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.760
There have been some interesting questions,

17:46.760 --> 17:48.920
like Kenji in our IRC room wondering,

17:48.920 --> 17:50.600
how's this going to work around?

17:50.600 --> 17:53.500
Is it per machine or CPU or person?

17:53.500 --> 17:56.960
So I buy it, and then I give my computer to Brent.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.040
Is that a separate thing?

17:58.040 --> 18:01.440
Does he need to buy a new copy of that from Intel himself?

18:01.440 --> 18:03.920
Or can you transfer it from one machine to the next,

18:03.920 --> 18:06.060
for instance, if you have a personal license

18:06.060 --> 18:08.880
and you have two computers and you change the workload on one

18:08.880 --> 18:10.440
and you decide it's more suited to the other,

18:10.440 --> 18:11.920
can you just move that over?

18:11.920 --> 18:15.280
Yeah, or what happens when you reload your box?

18:15.280 --> 18:18.160
Because these are getting written to this virtual device.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.560
That has to happen somehow.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.720
And if you nuke and pave your system,

18:22.720 --> 18:24.040
what makes that stick around?

18:24.040 --> 18:26.160
Yeah, the administration side will be interesting, too.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.160
What's persisting this, and is it, yeah?

18:28.160 --> 18:31.360
Devil's advocate aside now, this is clearly a step back.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.600
This is absolutely something that I will

18:33.600 --> 18:35.800
be voting with my wallet on.

18:35.800 --> 18:37.680
I made that comment quickly in land,

18:37.680 --> 18:40.880
but just to expand on that, the Ryzen systems

18:40.880 --> 18:42.960
have never looked any better as far as I'm concerned.

18:42.960 --> 18:46.160
And I could live a long, happy life with Ryzen systems

18:46.160 --> 18:48.000
and Apple M-based systems.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.960
And as long as I can run Linux on both,

18:49.960 --> 18:51.880
I may never need Intel again.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.560
You combine that with Raspberry Pi's,

18:53.560 --> 18:55.920
Intel's been less relevant than ever for me.

18:55.920 --> 18:58.160
And I see this kind of stuff, and I

18:58.160 --> 19:00.360
understand that because it's GPL software

19:00.360 --> 19:02.640
and they're just creating a device that you write files to,

19:02.640 --> 19:04.120
it's going to land in the kernel.

19:04.120 --> 19:07.000
Because it's Intel, there's not going to be a lot of pushback.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.520
I wish this stuff got more scrutiny.

19:09.520 --> 19:11.680
I have a ton of love and respect for the kernel team.

19:11.680 --> 19:13.960
I think they get away with this kind of stuff all the time.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.120
The University of Minnesota stuff

19:15.120 --> 19:16.580
should have gotten more scrutiny.

19:16.580 --> 19:18.080
This should be getting more scrutiny.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.440
But because we love these people,

19:19.440 --> 19:22.320
and because they work so hard, I think

19:22.320 --> 19:24.240
we are hesitant to criticize.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.520
I don't know if criticism is the right place, though.

19:26.520 --> 19:27.960
Like, I don't know that insisting

19:27.960 --> 19:30.440
that they take this moral judgment is.

19:30.440 --> 19:33.280
I think I could see you making the opposite argument of wanting

19:33.280 --> 19:39.960
them to remain a useful, neutral tool to be used for whatever

19:39.960 --> 19:43.760
purpose, especially considering that that's so much of what

19:43.760 --> 19:45.080
makes it successful.

19:45.080 --> 19:47.160
We often, on the show, talk about,

19:47.160 --> 19:49.080
yeah, there's the philosophy part, which I think

19:49.080 --> 19:51.360
matters to us, at least the hosts of the show,

19:51.360 --> 19:54.480
a fair amount, but matters seemingly less and less

19:54.480 --> 19:59.040
to the general cloud public who just use it as a tool.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.000
Yeah, I think where I really get concerned

20:01.000 --> 20:05.600
and I feel like where I've kind of landed on this one is,

20:05.600 --> 20:07.600
you're right, it's not their role,

20:07.600 --> 20:10.280
but it's sort of like our last line of defense.

20:10.280 --> 20:13.240
That's where I just go, if anybody was going to stop this,

20:13.240 --> 20:17.560
or if anybody was just going to embarrass Intel for doing this,

20:17.560 --> 20:20.460
it would be these developers with this platform,

20:20.460 --> 20:23.480
even if it just kind of raised awareness in the consumer

20:23.480 --> 20:26.760
population so they could start voting with their wallets.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.480
But instead, it's just been totally quiet.

20:28.480 --> 20:29.600
Yeah, it has been very quiet.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.240
It does make me think it's one of those areas that

20:32.240 --> 20:35.880
seems to come up a lot these days of sort of not

20:35.880 --> 20:38.480
necessarily the letter of the law, but the spirit

20:38.480 --> 20:40.520
and what their behavior will be.

20:40.520 --> 20:42.740
If this is really a thing that's limited to, say,

20:42.740 --> 20:46.000
a feature that's only used by giant data centers

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
when they're training models or doing some specific task that

20:49.000 --> 20:51.880
really is not applicable to my sort of use case,

20:51.880 --> 20:54.880
even as a somewhat odd user of software,

20:54.880 --> 20:57.120
a technological enthusiast, then maybe it's

20:57.120 --> 20:58.080
not that big of a deal.

20:58.080 --> 21:01.960
But if it's something that most Intel buyers start running

21:01.960 --> 21:04.600
into, that'll sour things pretty quick.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.000
I imagine not, right?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.240
I imagine it's the enterprise that's really going to get it.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.880
Well, I mean, they're the ones who are going to shell out

21:09.880 --> 21:11.000
the money anyway, right?

21:11.000 --> 21:11.500
Right.

21:11.500 --> 21:15.240
And there's so many nickel and dimey ways you can do this.

21:15.240 --> 21:18.680
And you could see a CPU that maybe has more cores you

21:18.680 --> 21:19.800
can turn on.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.280
And you've got to license it for that.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.840
And then it's a lot more manageable problem, too,

21:24.840 --> 21:28.040
because then you're making Red Hat, SUSE, and Debian packages.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.640
And you've pretty much covered all of the enterprise

21:30.640 --> 21:31.920
deployments that are going to be using this thing.

21:31.920 --> 21:32.920
I suppose so, right?

21:32.920 --> 21:35.560
You know, but again, I want to just mention LW one more time.

21:35.560 --> 21:39.080
Because there was a bit in here that I think resonated with me.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.440
They're talking about business models in here

21:41.440 --> 21:44.520
and talking about how car manufacturers like Tesla

21:44.520 --> 21:46.960
want to include features that you pay for to turn them on.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.920
And we've kind of just accepted this.

21:48.920 --> 21:51.200
They're calling these rent-based business models.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.400
And they say it's been spreading through the technology

21:53.400 --> 21:54.960
industry for some time.

21:54.960 --> 21:57.480
Many of us have no longer purchased and even run

21:57.480 --> 21:58.120
our own servers.

21:58.120 --> 21:59.920
We run them from a cloud provider.

21:59.920 --> 22:02.320
Companies are still in the proprietary software business.

22:02.320 --> 22:05.480
But they're finding that monthly subscription models are appealing.

22:05.480 --> 22:08.720
Simply, it just works better than regular software licensing.

22:08.720 --> 22:10.360
And of course, there's dodgy websites

22:10.360 --> 22:12.160
out there that handle payments for all kinds

22:12.160 --> 22:13.000
of different content.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.600
He's making a joke about LWN, which is a paid-for content

22:15.600 --> 22:16.760
website there.

22:16.760 --> 22:19.560
But the issue really comes down to free software

22:19.560 --> 22:22.640
is supposed to enable freedom and access to these machines.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.760
But now we're going to find ourselves using it to our free

22:25.760 --> 22:27.880
software is going to ask the hardware for permission

22:27.880 --> 22:29.640
to be available to do things.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.400
Essentially, we're going to a model where free software

22:32.400 --> 22:35.480
enabled us to explore and use these computers, perhaps

22:35.480 --> 22:37.240
in ways that were never intended.

22:37.240 --> 22:40.280
And now we're going to a model where free software is relegated

22:40.280 --> 22:42.240
to the rest of the world asking for permission

22:42.240 --> 22:43.720
to get these features.

22:43.720 --> 22:46.360
If this approach is commercially successful,

22:46.360 --> 22:48.240
we're likely going to see more of it.

22:48.240 --> 22:51.240
And you combine that with kind of like the monthly subscription

22:51.240 --> 22:53.680
thing or something like that that Brent was saying.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.600
And then I think we kind of have a dystopia scenario.

22:55.600 --> 22:58.040
Oh, you can see like a weird, it's

22:58.040 --> 23:00.480
a range of CPUs that are targeting the netbook thing

23:00.480 --> 23:02.240
comes back or whatever right there.

23:02.240 --> 23:05.640
And you can't enroll your own TPM keys or something like that

23:05.640 --> 23:08.200
or the trust secure boot keys anymore

23:08.200 --> 23:11.920
unless you subscribe to the enterprise model.

23:11.920 --> 23:15.000
Is there an opportunity here for some of the reverse engineering

23:15.000 --> 23:18.320
that we're seeing in like the M1, for instance?

23:18.320 --> 23:20.720
Is any of that even possible in this case?

23:20.720 --> 23:23.160
That's a good question, Brent, because some

23:23.160 --> 23:26.080
of what's made the M1 Linux port possible

23:26.080 --> 23:28.800
is a lot of the functionalities at the firmware level.

23:28.800 --> 23:32.280
So the drivers just hand it off and the firmware does it.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.820
We see this with the Nvidia card.

23:33.820 --> 23:36.040
Like this new open source driver is really

23:36.040 --> 23:38.040
being made possible because the firmware is

23:38.040 --> 23:40.200
going to handle a lot of the stuff that Nvidia wanted

23:40.200 --> 23:42.880
the driver to handle in the past, for better or for worse.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.760
But we're definitely seeing this transition

23:45.760 --> 23:48.880
to the software side is a lot simpler

23:48.880 --> 23:50.600
and the complexity is being offloaded

23:50.600 --> 23:52.620
to the individual hardware components.

23:52.620 --> 23:55.240
And these are like little micro operating systems

23:55.240 --> 23:57.160
and microcomputers all in their own.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.640
And it's just becoming more and more common.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.840
Well, just at the same time as we see, yeah, and way

24:01.840 --> 24:04.020
more specialized chips for various roles

24:04.020 --> 24:06.360
instead of just one big old generalized CPU.

24:06.360 --> 24:08.820
Yeah, I think it's a good and bad thing.

24:08.820 --> 24:10.520
I think we're seeing the pros and cons of it.

24:10.520 --> 24:13.200
I think in the example of the M1 stuff,

24:13.200 --> 24:16.360
it's meant the Linux port has gone very, very rapidly

24:16.360 --> 24:17.540
from what I thought it would.

24:17.540 --> 24:20.880
And it seems like there's a nice little halves and gets

24:20.880 --> 24:23.720
that the developers are getting because of the functionality

24:23.720 --> 24:25.600
that the firmware handles.

24:25.600 --> 24:27.000
Same thing with Nvidia.

24:27.000 --> 24:28.960
If you want the functionality of an Nvidia card,

24:28.960 --> 24:31.200
or you want access to CUDA and Nvidia Compute,

24:31.200 --> 24:32.700
but you didn't want to have to hassle

24:32.700 --> 24:36.200
with the proprietary driver, well, they

24:36.200 --> 24:37.440
found a solution around that.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.840
And this is the future we're going into.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.400
And it's built in at the hardware level.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.760
And it's going to be trickier to navigate.

24:44.760 --> 24:45.800
There's going to be different things

24:45.800 --> 24:48.280
to consider for consumers now when we're buying hardware.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.920
It's not just going to be speed and specs.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.320
Yeah, there's more in there because it's

24:52.320 --> 24:54.360
running its own, basically, software as well.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.880
And you're going to have to care about how well that's

24:55.880 --> 24:56.440
implemented.

24:56.440 --> 24:57.520
Yeah, you're going to have to care about,

24:57.520 --> 24:58.940
how does that firmware work?

24:58.940 --> 25:00.440
What kind of driver does it have now?

25:00.440 --> 25:02.760
It's a whole new kind of nuance that we're going

25:02.760 --> 25:04.000
to have to help people navigate.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.400
And a reminder that as far as we've

25:05.400 --> 25:08.240
gotten in some areas with free and open source software,

25:08.240 --> 25:12.760
there's a whole other layer down there.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.920
So Jonathan has a great post at LWN.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.040
Again, I've mentioned that.

25:16.040 --> 25:16.620
We'll link it.

25:16.620 --> 25:19.440
I'd love to hear the audience's reaction to this

25:19.440 --> 25:23.040
because my question to you out there,

25:23.040 --> 25:25.520
where do you personally draw the line?

25:25.520 --> 25:27.360
Is your Android device fine because that

25:27.360 --> 25:29.360
requires a bunch of firmware?

25:29.360 --> 25:31.520
What about a Nintendo Switch?

25:31.520 --> 25:33.880
What about electric cars like the Tesla

25:33.880 --> 25:37.120
that you can buy self-driving or whatever for $10,000

25:37.120 --> 25:39.800
or whatever it is after the fact?

25:39.800 --> 25:41.960
Where do we draw that line?

25:41.960 --> 25:44.020
And are you concerned about the slide

25:44.020 --> 25:46.880
into subscriptions for every little component there?

25:46.880 --> 25:49.040
So send us a boost in with a new podcast app

25:49.040 --> 25:51.680
or use the Breeze app if you don't switch podcast apps.

25:51.680 --> 25:54.000
Or send us an email at linuxunplugged.com

25:54.000 --> 25:56.040
slash contact and let us know what you think.

25:59.040 --> 26:01.860
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

26:01.860 --> 26:04.160
Go get started with a free trial for Teams, Enterprise,

26:04.160 --> 26:07.520
or a personal account at bitwarden.com slash Linux.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.400
As an individual user, I love it.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.920
But of course, as a business owner,

26:10.920 --> 26:13.400
it's been, I think, a big part to what keeps our information

26:13.400 --> 26:14.720
secure and protected.

26:14.720 --> 26:17.200
Bitwarden is the easiest way for an individual or a business

26:17.200 --> 26:20.240
to store, share, and sync sensitive information.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.600
And Bitwarden is open source.

26:21.600 --> 26:24.160
It's trusted by millions of users in their community.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.960
It has a self-hosted component as well.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.520
And it's what Wes and I use to store all of our passwords,

26:28.520 --> 26:29.720
manage our two-factor codes.

26:29.720 --> 26:32.960
We're both customers of Bitwarden Cloud, which is just

26:32.960 --> 26:35.680
an unbelievable great deal.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.280
Man, and you know they keep adding new features too.

26:38.280 --> 26:41.560
Bitwarden has rolled out account switching.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.640
That's great.

26:42.640 --> 26:45.640
But now they've just recently added the ability on Android

26:45.640 --> 26:48.360
to switch accounts while you're at the password fill out.

26:48.360 --> 26:49.840
You know, this is so nice because I

26:49.840 --> 26:52.440
have a business account and a personal account.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.400
And now, right there, when you're at the prompt,

26:54.400 --> 26:57.000
you can tap the avatar bubble and switch

26:57.000 --> 26:59.680
to another account quickly, get the password access,

26:59.680 --> 27:01.740
authenticate, and deploy that one password.

27:01.740 --> 27:03.600
How nice is that?

27:03.600 --> 27:05.160
Account switching has been great.

27:05.160 --> 27:07.080
And one of the features I'm just getting into,

27:07.080 --> 27:10.280
and it just got better, is their username generator.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.760
Now, this makes it easy to create a random username

27:12.760 --> 27:15.300
for a website you're signing up for or a service

27:15.300 --> 27:16.720
and add an extra level of security.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.640
That's just genius.

27:18.640 --> 27:21.120
But now, they're making it even easier to use.

27:21.120 --> 27:23.560
When you generate a new username,

27:23.560 --> 27:27.060
there will now be an option to create an email address

27:27.060 --> 27:28.960
with a subselection for choosing something

27:28.960 --> 27:34.480
like simple login, a non-addy, or my favorite, Firefox Relay.

27:34.480 --> 27:35.040
Yeah.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.440
So you just enter the API key for your individual account

27:37.440 --> 27:39.760
for that service, like Firefox Relay.

27:39.760 --> 27:43.080
And then, upon generation of the username and the password,

27:43.080 --> 27:46.240
it'll also generate that email address that's

27:46.240 --> 27:47.560
just for them and unique.

27:47.560 --> 27:49.760
A new alias is instantly registered to your account.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.300
And it's all saved in Bitwarden and then synced across

27:52.300 --> 27:55.320
your devices automatically.

27:55.320 --> 27:56.920
Using a good password manager is probably

27:56.920 --> 27:59.640
one of the number one things you can do for your security.

27:59.640 --> 28:00.540
You probably already know that.

28:00.540 --> 28:03.040
But if a friend or a family or a colleague or your workplace

28:03.040 --> 28:05.600
hasn't really wrapped their noodle around that,

28:05.600 --> 28:06.760
have them try out Bitwarden.

28:06.760 --> 28:07.960
It's the best way to do this.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.240
And you can support the show and get a free trial

28:10.240 --> 28:12.520
for Teams, Enterprise, or an individual plan

28:12.520 --> 28:14.800
by going to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

28:14.800 --> 28:15.600
That's where you go.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.200
Go right now.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.760
Support the show and try it out.

28:17.760 --> 28:21.240
It's like a low-hanging fruit to protect yourself.

28:21.240 --> 28:23.920
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

28:27.760 --> 28:30.000
As always, we got some great feedback this week.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.320
Chris wrote in.

28:31.320 --> 28:34.000
Last week, you mentioned the new HP laptop running Pop!

28:34.000 --> 28:34.560
OS.

28:34.560 --> 28:37.360
And it did get me wondering about whether devs really

28:37.360 --> 28:39.520
use laptops all that much.

28:39.520 --> 28:40.400
I'm not a dev.

28:40.400 --> 28:43.040
And it would drive me nuts to sit in front of the laptop

28:43.040 --> 28:45.360
all day trying to get anything serious done.

28:45.360 --> 28:49.580
Wouldn't the standard pony for a dev or any other heavy PC user

28:49.580 --> 28:52.080
be the most powerful desktop with the biggest

28:52.080 --> 28:53.760
monitor you could afford?

28:53.760 --> 28:57.280
I seem to only use my laptop when I'm on the road.

28:57.280 --> 28:59.600
Well, Wes, you're a developer by day.

28:59.600 --> 29:00.720
Do you use a laptop?

29:00.720 --> 29:02.000
Yes, I do.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.480
Yeah, you know, I think you probably

29:03.480 --> 29:05.720
would assume it would be a nice big workstation.

29:05.720 --> 29:08.860
I think for folks open source work or at homework,

29:08.860 --> 29:10.440
that probably is often the case.

29:10.440 --> 29:11.680
Maybe this is one of those things

29:11.680 --> 29:15.080
that needs to get caught up for our post-pandemic working

29:15.080 --> 29:16.160
remotely life.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.920
But I think a lot of it comes down

29:17.920 --> 29:20.000
to just sort of the lowest common denominator, right?

29:20.000 --> 29:22.280
Like, your folks need to sometimes go to meetings.

29:22.280 --> 29:23.560
They sometimes travel for work.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.000
They sometimes go to conferences.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.480
And therefore, you're either going to get them two machines

29:27.480 --> 29:29.000
or you just get them one.

29:29.000 --> 29:31.600
And to be clear, no one's really sitting there just

29:31.600 --> 29:33.800
typing on a single laptop unless they have to, right?

29:33.800 --> 29:36.160
Like, these days, you've got sort of hotel stations

29:36.160 --> 29:37.880
where you just plug into a dock at a little

29:37.880 --> 29:40.160
wherever you're sitting down and you've got all the monitors

29:40.160 --> 29:40.640
you need.

29:40.640 --> 29:42.520
I wonder, too, if the work from home trends

29:42.520 --> 29:44.480
have maybe accelerated this a bit so that way you can take

29:44.480 --> 29:45.720
your machine back and forth.

29:45.720 --> 29:49.040
But if you look at the sales numbers,

29:49.040 --> 29:51.720
laptops are selling like gangbusters over desktops.

29:51.720 --> 29:54.400
And if you look specifically at Apple,

29:54.400 --> 29:56.800
they sell way more MacBook Pros than they

29:56.800 --> 29:58.840
do regular desktop machines.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.920
And they target those things hard at developers.

30:01.920 --> 30:03.720
And I think they've done a pretty good job

30:03.720 --> 30:07.760
of balancing dedicated CPU versus integrated CPU or disk

30:07.760 --> 30:10.000
and except for when they didn't with the bad keyboards

30:10.000 --> 30:10.600
and stuff.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.160
And you see Dell adopt the Sputnik model.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.800
You see HP with the Dev1.

30:14.800 --> 30:17.880
And of course, System76 is catering to that audience.

30:17.880 --> 30:21.400
I think there's something nice about having everything in one.

30:21.400 --> 30:22.960
That's why the iMac's popular, too.

30:22.960 --> 30:25.000
I think there's people that like the all-in-one.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.520
But I get where you're coming from,

30:26.520 --> 30:29.260
other Chris, because it's like for me,

30:29.260 --> 30:30.680
I can tell the difference when I'm

30:30.680 --> 30:32.800
using a workstation still versus a laptop.

30:32.800 --> 30:35.480
It's beginning to change, but I still

30:35.480 --> 30:38.240
feel like there's a performance delta

30:38.240 --> 30:39.760
between a laptop and a desktop.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.000
Right, so you'd be the one sort of complaining to IT,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.200
I really need a desktop.

30:44.200 --> 30:47.240
I need one, and a laptop, and a tablet, and a phone,

30:47.240 --> 30:48.800
obviously.

30:48.800 --> 30:51.760
Oh, and a projector, too.

30:51.760 --> 30:55.760
Now, we did get a lot of questions around the Pop OS

30:55.760 --> 30:59.360
and HP sort of project that we touched on last week.

30:59.360 --> 31:03.160
And we got some boosts about that, too.

31:03.160 --> 31:07.240
And now, it is time for Le Boost.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.760
Nick wrote in with some feedback,

31:08.760 --> 31:11.920
and the golden dragon wrote in with a boost six days ago

31:11.920 --> 31:15.280
with two, two, two, two sats, which

31:15.280 --> 31:17.000
apparently is a row of ducks.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.840
I'm a duck, D-U-K, duck, loaded with talent.

31:20.840 --> 31:21.360
It is.

31:21.360 --> 31:25.160
If you type in two, two, two, two into a calculator,

31:25.160 --> 31:27.520
it looks like a row of those yellow duckies.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.840
I think we got a sat amount last week as well.

31:29.840 --> 31:33.640
That was one of those old calculator secrets, which

31:33.640 --> 31:35.560
maybe we'll have to look back on that.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.400
So the golden dragon wrote in.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.680
Now, this sounds promising.

31:39.680 --> 31:44.400
HP plus Pop with AMD seems like a stellar dev system.

31:44.400 --> 31:47.000
The one question I would have is,

31:47.000 --> 31:49.920
what is a killer system like this going to cost?

31:49.920 --> 31:52.320
Well, I think we'd know it's going to start around $1,000.

31:52.320 --> 31:53.400
I thought it was like $1099, something like that, right?

31:53.400 --> 31:54.800
Yeah, something like that.

31:54.800 --> 31:57.000
What we don't know is what the price goes up

31:57.000 --> 31:58.480
to when you tweak the specs.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.160
Because that came with 16 gigs of RAM

32:00.160 --> 32:02.240
and one terabyte of disk space, which is really

32:02.240 --> 32:04.440
not too bad for that price.

32:04.440 --> 32:07.520
And 16 gigs of RAM might be the max,

32:07.520 --> 32:09.760
but you might be able to tweak storage and processor.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.360
We are collecting these questions,

32:11.360 --> 32:14.720
so keep sending them in.

32:14.720 --> 32:15.680
Boost.

32:15.680 --> 32:17.800
Yeah, Nick wrote in about the same lines

32:17.800 --> 32:20.000
with some great questions I think are worth exploring

32:20.000 --> 32:21.640
in the future as well, one of them

32:21.640 --> 32:24.840
being, how long is the laptop going to be supported?

32:24.840 --> 32:26.680
Firmware updates, how are those going to work?

32:26.680 --> 32:30.000
Will it use the existing Pop OS firmware delivery method?

32:30.000 --> 32:31.880
I thought those were all really good questions.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.920
Yeah, you know, I haven't really used an HP machine for a while.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.320
Are they playing nice with some of our fancy new Linux

32:36.320 --> 32:36.920
firmware stuff?

32:36.920 --> 32:39.240
Yeah, I hope it has LVFS support, right?

32:39.240 --> 32:40.720
It needs that LVFS.

32:40.720 --> 32:41.200
Come on.

32:41.200 --> 32:41.800
It needs that.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.040
Yeah, that's a good question.

32:43.040 --> 32:46.040
Magenta Sheep boosts in using Buries no less,

32:46.040 --> 32:50.920
six days ago, with 3,142 SATs.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.720
Is that Pop OS HP system running Core Boot?

32:53.720 --> 32:55.680
That is probably the number one question we got.

32:55.680 --> 32:56.480
Yeah, right there.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.440
Oh, I've written that one down.

32:58.440 --> 33:01.360
I don't know how much can be shared yet or not too,

33:01.360 --> 33:05.000
so I got to get information on the NDAs around this thing.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.160
Keeping secrets from us.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.520
I don't have the info, but I just

33:07.520 --> 33:08.640
know that once I get it, there's going

33:08.640 --> 33:10.400
to be that kind of thing, so.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.680
Core Boot's definitely the number one question though.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.520
We got a double boost from Magenta Sheep

33:14.520 --> 33:19.240
six days ago, 3,142 SATs again.

33:19.240 --> 33:26.600
They write, ZFS's killer feature for me is sending

33:26.600 --> 33:28.360
encrypted raw snapshots.

33:28.360 --> 33:30.360
Nothing else I know of lets me have

33:30.360 --> 33:32.680
better security and integrity.

33:32.680 --> 33:38.080
Not just an encrypted snapshot, but an encrypted raw snapshot.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.720
I hear from the audience all kinds of clever ways

33:40.720 --> 33:42.360
they're using ZFS send and receive.

33:42.360 --> 33:42.920
Totally.

33:42.920 --> 33:45.920
To move things around between data centers and servers.

33:45.920 --> 33:47.280
And that's an awesome feature.

33:47.280 --> 33:50.400
When we get to poking at BcashFS in a real way,

33:50.400 --> 33:52.800
I think we've got to play around with some of these features

33:52.800 --> 33:56.400
that people love about ZFS and ButterFS.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.480
Speaking of BcashFS.

33:58.480 --> 34:03.880
Oh yes, user 7620 boosted in five days ago with 10,000 SATs.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.760
B-O-O-S-T.

34:05.760 --> 34:07.640
Hooray for BcashFS.

34:07.640 --> 34:08.800
I can't wait.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.280
Hey, well, user 6720.

34:11.280 --> 34:11.960
We agree.

34:11.960 --> 34:12.520
We agree.

34:12.520 --> 34:14.040
I still have it on that laptop.

34:14.040 --> 34:15.600
I'll run it for a little bit.

34:15.600 --> 34:19.240
I got to also figure out a good set of benchmarks.

34:19.240 --> 34:21.680
So we'll be chatting about that in the future.

34:21.680 --> 34:22.760
I agree, though.

34:22.760 --> 34:23.440
Very exciting.

34:23.440 --> 34:26.480
You know, I'm curious about those two touch on kind

34:26.480 --> 34:28.960
of the same topic we explored last week.

34:28.960 --> 34:31.440
And I wondered how ButterFS dealt with,

34:31.440 --> 34:33.400
I've been reading tons about it this week,

34:33.400 --> 34:37.520
but I wondered how you mentioned ZFS's encrypted raw snapshots.

34:37.520 --> 34:39.920
Well, how does ButterFS compare in there?

34:39.920 --> 34:42.480
I want to know for my own purposes here.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.120
Sounds like you have some experimenting to do.

34:44.120 --> 34:44.840
I do.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.800
Young master brand.

34:46.800 --> 34:57.960
Michael wrote in with a boost as well one day ago, 30,000 SATs.

34:57.960 --> 35:00.920
He writes, helping you helping others, smiley face.

35:00.920 --> 35:03.280
Supporting open source projects is a great idea.

35:03.280 --> 35:07.280
Ah, this is in reference to sending a 15% split

35:07.280 --> 35:10.280
to OpenSATs, which we're doing this episode as well,

35:10.280 --> 35:13.040
which is a nonprofit charity that

35:13.040 --> 35:16.240
gives 100% of the revenue sent to their general funds

35:16.240 --> 35:18.080
to free software projects.

35:18.080 --> 35:21.560
And so when you boost this here podcast and office hours,

35:21.560 --> 35:23.120
we're doing a little experiment.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.760
15% goes to OpenSATs.

35:25.760 --> 35:29.000
So for this episode, if my rough quick math as we're doing this

35:29.000 --> 35:32.840
is right, we've sent about 3,200 and change to OpenSATs.

35:32.840 --> 35:33.480
Nice.

35:33.480 --> 35:35.200
Yeah, that's pretty great.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.200
So thank you, everybody, for helping us experiment

35:37.200 --> 35:38.120
with that.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.840
You did note in there, we have a couple of folks

35:40.840 --> 35:42.320
that are now boosting in with Breeze.

35:42.320 --> 35:45.920
That's B-R-E-E-Z. I think it's breeze.technology

35:45.920 --> 35:47.160
for the website.

35:47.160 --> 35:50.920
This works on Android or iOS.

35:50.920 --> 35:54.360
And what it essentially does is it gives you a lightning node

35:54.360 --> 35:55.400
in your pocket.

35:55.400 --> 35:59.120
I thought you were just happy to see me.

35:59.120 --> 36:00.040
Well done, sir.

36:00.040 --> 36:01.520
Well done.

36:01.520 --> 36:04.880
Breeze is sort of a front end to different services

36:04.880 --> 36:07.080
on the Lightning Network, including

36:07.080 --> 36:08.800
value for value podcasts.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.200
And so it's a way to send in a boost

36:11.200 --> 36:14.440
without having to switch from your favorite podcast app.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.720
Eventually, there is discussion for folks

36:16.720 --> 36:19.400
like AntennaPod, which AntennaPod supports

36:19.400 --> 36:21.080
a lot of podcasting 2.0 features,

36:21.080 --> 36:24.040
but not value and boost yet, although they

36:24.040 --> 36:26.440
are looking at integrating Breeze to accomplish that.

36:26.440 --> 36:26.960
Oh.

36:26.960 --> 36:27.640
Yeah.

36:27.640 --> 36:29.340
So you get a little head start right now.

36:29.340 --> 36:31.720
It is pretty cool, for better or for worse,

36:31.720 --> 36:33.520
to run a lightning node in your pocket.

36:33.520 --> 36:36.680
You can also grab a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

36:36.680 --> 36:39.080
I'm using Fountain FM these days.

36:39.080 --> 36:40.240
You can follow me on Fountain.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.680
I'm at chrislas.

36:41.680 --> 36:43.840
And I'm clipping the podcasts that I listen to,

36:43.840 --> 36:45.880
including JB shows and others.

36:45.880 --> 36:48.120
So if you're interested in the podcasts I listen to,

36:48.120 --> 36:49.380
you can follow me on Fountain.

36:49.380 --> 36:50.880
I'm just at chrislas.

36:50.880 --> 36:53.480
And it's fountain.fm, I think, for that.

36:53.480 --> 36:56.680
newpodcastapps.com has them all.

36:56.680 --> 36:59.360
And with that, gentlemen, you know what it's time for?

36:59.360 --> 37:00.280
The picks.

37:00.280 --> 37:03.080
It is time for the picks.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.600
And I had a hard time picking one

37:04.600 --> 37:06.400
that I felt was on theme for this week.

37:06.400 --> 37:07.560
So that's the thing I've been trying to do.

37:07.560 --> 37:08.680
Yes, you have.

37:08.680 --> 37:12.240
Not just some random dirty pick, but one that's on theme.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.080
And I think I found it.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.360
I mentioned earlier in the show

37:15.360 --> 37:18.420
that my Ubuntu system was using Linux 5.18 already.

37:18.420 --> 37:21.320
And it's this tool I'm using to do it.

37:21.320 --> 37:24.160
I was suspicious you were compiling these things by hand.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.440
Actually, if you recall, what were we doing, Wes?

37:26.440 --> 37:28.960
You and I were in here recently recording,

37:28.960 --> 37:30.680
and a pop-up as we finished came up and said,

37:30.680 --> 37:31.720
5.18's ready.

37:31.720 --> 37:33.600
It must have been last week's.

37:33.600 --> 37:34.960
It must have been last week's, yeah.

37:34.960 --> 37:36.760
It's really just that.

37:36.760 --> 37:37.960
It's not an app you should use.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.080
Don't do what Chris does.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.040
Don't do this.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.880
To tell you what kind of a lunatic I am

37:41.880 --> 37:43.120
and why you should never do this,

37:43.120 --> 37:45.440
I'm actually doing this on KDE Neon, too.

37:45.440 --> 37:46.280
So it's not even like,

37:46.280 --> 37:48.600
it's already kind of a Frank and Ubuntu setup.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.320
So I got Neon on top of Ubuntu,

37:50.320 --> 37:52.320
and then I'm also on top of that role on my own kernel.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.320
Don't do this.

37:53.320 --> 37:55.880
But if you want to, it's called Ubuntu Mainline,

37:55.880 --> 37:58.480
and it lets you pick your version.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.280
And you can have multiple versions.

38:00.280 --> 38:01.480
You can go way back.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.720
You can do all kinds of stuff.

38:02.720 --> 38:04.440
Or you can be a madman

38:04.440 --> 38:08.040
and literally get a new kernel the day it's posted,

38:08.040 --> 38:09.600
and a little pop-up will come up

38:09.600 --> 38:11.480
if you leave the notifications on,

38:11.480 --> 38:12.600
and it downloads and installs.

38:12.600 --> 38:13.440
It's just a PPA away.

38:13.440 --> 38:16.160
Does the thing have like RC releases, too,

38:16.160 --> 38:17.000
if you wanted to help test out?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.080
I think it does, Wes.

38:18.080 --> 38:18.920
Yes, it does.

38:18.920 --> 38:19.760
In fact, it does.

38:19.760 --> 38:20.720
I just skip them.

38:20.720 --> 38:21.680
Yeah, sure, sure.

38:21.680 --> 38:23.680
Yeah, and you can purge older kernels,

38:23.680 --> 38:25.120
and you can choose some of this stuff.

38:25.120 --> 38:27.840
I should mention, it gives you a GUI to manage all this,

38:27.840 --> 38:29.560
which is handy.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.440
You can also get the header packages

38:31.440 --> 38:34.400
if you need to build stuff and whatnot

38:34.400 --> 38:36.320
for your other modules and stuff.

38:36.320 --> 38:40.800
And honestly, as much as I say don't use this,

38:40.800 --> 38:41.640
Maybe use it.

38:41.640 --> 38:45.480
I've been using it for 10 months on this machine.

38:45.480 --> 38:46.960
You're just telling us about this now?

38:46.960 --> 38:47.800
Yeah.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.040
That's what's been putting that skip in your step.

38:49.040 --> 38:51.400
You know why I did it?

38:51.400 --> 38:53.560
Is initially, I was just a little disappointed

38:53.560 --> 38:54.400
in the performance.

38:54.400 --> 38:55.800
It felt like the machine was getting slow,

38:55.800 --> 38:58.120
and I'm like, I need a little more pep in my step.

38:58.120 --> 38:59.400
Maybe a newer kernel will do it.

38:59.400 --> 39:00.920
And you know what?

39:00.920 --> 39:03.600
It did break my NVIDIA driver, however.

39:03.600 --> 39:06.400
So I'm using the free NVIDIA driver again.

39:06.400 --> 39:08.040
This is why we can't have nice things.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.920
I probably could fix that,

39:09.920 --> 39:12.920
but I just give no crap at all.

39:12.920 --> 39:14.120
You know what I mean?

39:14.120 --> 39:15.360
It's an old NVIDIA card,

39:15.360 --> 39:18.840
and I've spent so many years fighting the NVIDIA driver

39:18.840 --> 39:20.040
on laptops and stuff,

39:20.040 --> 39:22.840
that now that it's the lights at the end of the tunnel,

39:22.840 --> 39:24.000
I just can't be bothered.

39:24.000 --> 39:24.840
You're done.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.000
I'm playing Race the Sun on this thing.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.160
What do I need 3D acceleration for?

39:30.160 --> 39:31.200
So, good enough.

39:31.200 --> 39:32.360
But that might also explain

39:32.360 --> 39:34.120
why the machine's been a little laggy.

39:34.120 --> 39:35.560
If you'd like to give us a pick idea,

39:35.560 --> 39:37.800
you can go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact

39:37.800 --> 39:39.880
and send an idea in.

39:39.880 --> 39:41.680
We'd love to have them over there.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.200
If you want more show,

39:43.200 --> 39:44.680
well, there's a few ways you can do it.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.320
You can become a member.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.400
Linux Unplugged does have a membership program

39:48.400 --> 39:50.320
at unpluggedcore.com.

39:50.320 --> 39:53.080
These members get special access to two different feeds.

39:53.080 --> 39:54.520
One that's an ad-free feed,

39:54.520 --> 39:56.840
nice, tight, full production with all of Drew's editing,

39:56.840 --> 39:58.600
who's our summer editor right now.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.840
Or you can choose the live version.

40:00.840 --> 40:03.080
And then you'd know I just screwed that up right there.

40:03.080 --> 40:05.920
But because editor Drew is so smooth, you don't know.

40:05.920 --> 40:07.000
But if you listen to live version,

40:07.000 --> 40:08.200
you hear all the mess ups,

40:08.200 --> 40:09.600
all the times we stopped the show

40:09.600 --> 40:13.120
because Wes has got to go to the bathroom.

40:13.120 --> 40:14.520
Okay, that doesn't happen very often.

40:14.520 --> 40:15.800
But if it did, you'd know.

40:15.800 --> 40:18.000
Actually, what you really get with the live show

40:18.000 --> 40:19.920
is just more show.

40:19.920 --> 40:22.840
There's like almost an entire additional show

40:22.840 --> 40:24.160
in the pre and post show.

40:24.160 --> 40:26.040
It's just a lot more casual.

40:26.040 --> 40:27.680
And as a thank you,

40:27.680 --> 40:30.520
because you give us runway to decide which sponsors we do

40:30.520 --> 40:31.880
or don't wanna work with.

40:31.880 --> 40:33.360
It's not something we talk a lot about,

40:33.360 --> 40:35.160
but I've just for a little while,

40:35.160 --> 40:37.080
I'm gonna just mention

40:37.080 --> 40:40.760
that we get the most ridiculous pitches on this show.

40:40.760 --> 40:44.400
They get sent in for just all these kinds of crazy products

40:44.400 --> 40:47.000
and services that they want us to pitch to you guys.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.760
And it's so nice that our members give us the option

40:50.760 --> 40:53.760
to just hit the delete button on all of those emails, right?

40:53.760 --> 40:55.000
That's powerful.

40:55.000 --> 40:56.120
It keeps us independent.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.800
It keeps us focused on making content

40:57.800 --> 41:00.200
that's true to our audience and true to our members.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.920
So thank you to our members at unpluggedcore.com.

41:02.920 --> 41:05.120
And if you're missing Linux action news,

41:05.120 --> 41:07.560
well, then you are missing out on not only that Intel news,

41:07.560 --> 41:10.120
but a bunch of other stuff that happens every single week

41:10.120 --> 41:12.120
in the world of Linux and free software.

41:12.120 --> 41:14.360
So go to linuxactionnews.com for that.

41:14.360 --> 41:15.480
Plus you get more Westpain.

41:15.480 --> 41:16.560
Darn right.

41:16.560 --> 41:17.640
Darn right.

41:17.640 --> 41:19.960
Go get more Westpain at linuxactionnews.com.

41:19.960 --> 41:21.600
And last but not least,

41:21.600 --> 41:23.320
we'd love to have you join us live.

41:23.320 --> 41:24.640
See you next week.

41:24.640 --> 41:27.080
Same bad time, same bad station.

41:27.080 --> 41:28.120
Yeah, that's right.

41:28.120 --> 41:29.720
Why don't you come on over?

41:29.720 --> 41:31.400
We do the show on Sundays.

41:31.400 --> 41:34.400
We may be experimenting with some new tools,

41:34.400 --> 41:36.920
maybe experimenting with video streams for this year's show

41:36.920 --> 41:39.960
so you can see us doing the show live from the JB1 studio.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.200
Could have some announcements in that regard.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.600
Perhaps next Sunday would be a good one to join us for

41:45.600 --> 41:49.800
at jblive.tv, 12 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.520
Now links to everything we talked about today,

41:51.520 --> 41:54.760
that's over at linuxunplug.com slash 460.

41:54.760 --> 41:56.840
You can find our RSS feed over there,

41:56.840 --> 41:59.400
contact page, previous episodes,

41:59.400 --> 42:00.560
and then don't forget all the great shows

42:00.560 --> 42:02.800
over at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

42:02.800 --> 42:04.560
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

42:04.560 --> 42:05.920
of the Unplugged program.

42:05.920 --> 42:07.080
See you back here next week.

42:07.080 --> 42:23.920
If you like the show, please subscribe.

42:37.080 --> 42:52.180
The cone of silence.

42:52.180 --> 42:55.960
Do we have any more details on the London meetup?

42:55.960 --> 42:58.560
Because we didn't mention that in the show and I'm wondering we could like record a thing

42:58.560 --> 42:59.560
but is there any updates?

42:59.560 --> 43:03.280
Well, I think is our resident Canadian which is like halfway to England is my understanding

43:03.280 --> 43:04.280
Brent might know.

43:04.280 --> 43:06.080
You got anything new for us, Brent Lee?

43:06.080 --> 43:10.800
Last time we talked about this, which was on office hours last Tuesday.

43:10.800 --> 43:13.080
There were about 40 people signed up to go to the meetup.

43:13.080 --> 43:18.240
And as far as today, this update as this minute, there are 53 people.

43:18.240 --> 43:21.000
So I think the numbers are going up quite considerably.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.720
I think that might end up being a problem in terms of venue, but that's a good problem

43:25.720 --> 43:26.720
to have.

43:26.720 --> 43:30.560
So I feel like there and those are probably 53 really amazing people to go and meet.

43:30.560 --> 43:32.240
I feel kind of jealous.

43:32.240 --> 43:37.160
I see one Martin Wimpress on there, so perhaps Martin Wimpress could do some local advising.

43:37.160 --> 43:38.160
Mm hmm.

43:38.160 --> 43:39.160
All right.

43:39.160 --> 43:42.840
So this is I think this thing's happening, though, on August 6, 2022.

43:42.840 --> 43:44.160
I think this is happening.

43:44.160 --> 43:47.600
So what we'll do is let's we'll just play it cool.

43:47.600 --> 43:50.440
We'll pretend like we planned to do this in the post show the entire time.

43:50.440 --> 43:51.920
So get ready.

43:51.920 --> 43:53.920
The cone of silence.

43:53.920 --> 43:58.520
Hey, everybody, I just want to make sure that you know that London meetup is on.

43:58.520 --> 44:01.520
Go get details at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

44:01.520 --> 44:03.240
Hey, guys, look at this.

44:03.240 --> 44:04.760
Fifty three people attending already.

44:04.760 --> 44:05.760
Can you believe it?

44:05.760 --> 44:06.760
That is wow.

44:06.760 --> 44:09.760
I never expected that at all.

44:09.760 --> 44:32.080
What a surprise.
