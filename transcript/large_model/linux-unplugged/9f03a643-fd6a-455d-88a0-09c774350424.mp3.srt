1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
I don't love this like your discords out of date

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,720
I won't I know that shit is and especially especially why so that hit me on arch

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,480
And here's what happened

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,720
I was I was on air and I asked the discord room a question and then

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,800
Went down to my second desktop realized discord wasn't open which it normally is like oh crap well

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,740
Let me just go launch that really quick. Oh nope. Sorry you must update well, okay

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,800
It can't auto-update because I installed it using pac-man, so let me update it via the packer

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,120
Yeah, and nope can't do because of course dependencies are missing well

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,080
Let me install that dependency real quick nope can't do that because that conflicts is something else you have installed

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:45,120
So here I am on air doing a show trying to get discord installed on arch, and I'm like

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,680
Yeah, I'm gonna install solace hey

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Well speaking about the one on solace

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,840
And we got basically a warning on reddit from someone who's like there's a new discord out the one that you have

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,540
It's just stopped working. We're like wait. Well if you pull the Skype. Yeah, so you just can't get into any words all right

15
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,680
Yeah, we'll go update it this needs libc++. Okay. Oh, we don't have that

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:15,240
Which normally wouldn't be a problem, but libc++ is part of LLVM, and if you know anything about LLVM

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,240
It takes hours to build

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,840
Like it literally takes hours like you the way that we do the build it also has clang it has LLVM

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,680
Now has a libc++ LLDB

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,600
LLD all of that in a single tree, and it's also got to build it to 32-bit as well

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,440
All because I was like yeah, we're gonna use libc++ now

22
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,800
Why so just why the the quick fix on solace these days, which is a sudo snap install discord

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:49,720
Oh, it is a snap. Yeah, very good. I should have done that on arch. We didn't have snap either

24
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:59,040
We were screwed this is Linux unplugged episode 210 for August 15th 2017

25
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,040
Oh

26
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,320
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's literally reloading its Linux right before the show starts

27
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,440
My name is Chris. My name is Wes and hello Beardsley welcome back. Hello guys

28
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,240
We got a really good show lined up today

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,280
We have of course a few things to follow up on from last week, but before I address those

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,400
We've got to talk about a big birthday today. We got a big big birthday in the community

31
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,680
We have not one not two

32
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,760
But three awesome app picks for you guys in this week's episode just some really cool open source projects that need a little attention

33
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:51,280
And then the Internet's buddy I key has stopped by the program today to chat about solace 3

34
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:59,120
snap and flat pack support in solace and I might have a little thing or two to say about it as well

35
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,480
Then we're gonna do a little follow-up on the slack wear challenge. It turns out it turns out

36
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,600
I've been using slack wear a little more since the show and I have a couple of more things to say about it

37
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:16,640
This is probably the point of which we should say this week. We decided we are going to we're gonna punt the gen 2 challenge

38
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,280
Just because neither one of us felt like we spent enough time with it

39
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,960
There's a lot there and I and and part of my part of my problems

40
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,600
I kept using slack wear for a little while and then I'm doing good

41
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,460
I was like, okay, I'm ready to I'm ready to just really get into gen 2 and then that son of a gun I key

42
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:42,560
Hashtag blame. I key goes and releases a brand new version of solace. Oh, which I I immediately I immediately this morning

43
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,080
I'm how down on all of your USB drives automatically. I have it right here on this thumb stick, right?

44
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,920
That's the thumb stick right there and I I loaded it up on my main

45
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,080
Airmaster machine that we use to send every every all the images and play all the clips and stuff out to the stream

46
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,680
So I loaded solace 3 and I'll tell you about it why I decided to go with solace for my arch

47
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,000
Replacement on this machine and all of that

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,240
So I think we just have a ton of really good stuff to get into really excited about the community news the app picks and haven't wimpy

49
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:19,040
Here and I key are both back. I can't wait to chat with those guys. So let's start right there time-appropriate greetings virtual lug

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
greetings

51
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,480
Hello, it's good to see everybody. I guess it's probably pretty well known by now

52
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,480
I sort of snuck up on me. But today is gnomes 20th

53
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,520
birthday

54
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:41,100
Happy frickin 20th birthday gnome. That's impressive. There have been 33 stable releases since gnome 1.0 in

55
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,560
1999 god damn, I am old. Holy crap. You mean I was using Linux. I was using Linux before gnome

56
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,640
I guess that's that's Wow, that really makes me feel old

57
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:56,240
Anyways, 20 years 20 years of gnome is being celebrated right now and a website's been set up

58
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Happy birthday gnome org and they also have a handy donate to gnome button there and they have a timeline where the project really got

59
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:10,120
Started in 1997 which is about when I started become a and they've got that handy-dandy gnome 1.0 virtual machine if you want to relive

60
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,600
Yes, Lori. Look at this screenshot, too

61
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:21,620
You know, I remember I remember thinking how badass it was that the icons and the menus had textures like the gnome foot and the toolbox

62
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,300
They had like textured backgrounds. I thought that was so cool

63
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,140
I

64
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:34,660
Mean I would look just fine on your slack wear red Chris and isn't that isn't that don't they call that that?

65
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,060
That theme on the control bars there. Don't they call that crux? Isn't that called?

66
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,300
I mean, that's where that's what I think of when people say crux

67
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,340
Anyways, they have a nice nice timeline at happy birthday gnome org

68
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,700
So yeah, so what's interesting about that is there are other projects that I use today

69
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,780
That are older than no like wine wine for example is older than gnome

70
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:04,100
Isn't that something and of course Gwadek just wrapped up and you can find all of the videos from Gwadek up on YouTube

71
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,180
there's probably a couple that would be worth watching probably a couple that aren't and I

72
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,060
Don't know. It's just a it's kind of a big milestone. Of course today's the day. I also switched off no

73
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,860
But I'm still using the hell out of GTK so there you go

74
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:28,320
I also I just before we go any further wanted to say next week might be might be just in studio Bearden West

75
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,340
I'm not sure everything should be fine

76
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,740
But I am going down to that to the solar eclipse in Oregon and I'm starting to like a little bit

77
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,440
Get worried about the amount of people that are going to that thing. Yeah, so it could be a different show next week

78
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,240
I may be here

79
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,420
I may not meet up comm slash Jupiter broadcasting if you're gonna get your butt out to the Eclipse in the Oregon area and want

80
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,460
To meet up with us. That's that should be pretty good meet up comm slash Jupiter broadcasting

81
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,460
And then if nothing else, I should make it back in time

82
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,300
To the show, but what I'm worried about is because I'll be traveling

83
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,220
I still might not really get enough time to fully deep dive into gentoo. Okay, so I'm like me

84
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,860
No, I'm like worried that we might need to do a double punt which I feel bad about but at the same time like the audience

85
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,860
Has been asking for a gentoo challenge

86
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,700
So long deserves to be a good one right that's what I figure it's like if I so this week I ended up I ended

87
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,060
Up playing around with slack wear and then jumped over to solace and like well, wait a minute

88
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,980
I was supposed to I didn't really gentoo like I got gentoo started

89
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,100
I got a machine cleared off and I got like that process all started

90
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,300
But I didn't really go much further than just getting started. I'm like, well, I need to run it as a desktop

91
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,980
No long compiles. Yeah, it's okay

92
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,700
It's gonna take you about two weeks to compile Katie. I'm gonna put it

93
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,580
I'm gonna put it on that $10,000 Dell laptop and I'm just gonna let that thing rip through the

94
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,140
If it does half as good as it does as an encoding video, I think I think I'm gonna be fine

95
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:55,220
So anyways, that'll be so that could be maybe we're gonna punt then the gentoo challenge for two weeks

96
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,580
But then I was thinking that's not necessarily a hundred percent bad because that gives people time to try it out, too

97
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,980
Yeah, like what do you think beer you want you want to do it?

98
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:07,180
Yeah, I don't even in a little virtual machine I like using my

99
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,620
I just asked to have a good laugh cuz I knew what you were gonna say

100
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,240
I didn't even need to really ask I knew what the answer was

101
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,200
Anybody in the mumble room want to do a gentoo challenge with us?

102
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,380
Can I claim to be above it

103
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,740
Everybody else is busy getting things done

104
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:34,220
You bastard West you brought this upon us you brought this upon me you dirty dog you dirty dog

105
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:40,380
You called me out it during the outro music of last week's episode. The music was already playing. I mean I had to say yes

106
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,540
actually, it's kind of a good it's kind of a perfect timing to because

107
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,180
it's gonna be in a way going back to my roots and

108
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,400
That's kind of ideal when I'm sort of I'm distro shopping right now and right now

109
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:59,540
I'm seriously considering leaving solace on the air master machine doesn't necessarily mean that's where I want to use like that's that

110
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:04,380
LTS Ubuntu has been working great for that and this just it could work great for OBS. So

111
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,260
Times they are a change. So yeah, happy birthday to gnome

112
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,300
Sorry, you guys know gentoo challenge

113
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,300
But we got plenty of other stuff to talk to with I key here and all of that

114
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,940
Did you also see beard that there is a new release of OBS today OBS 20? I think it is came out today

115
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,860
I just saw the download come. I just saw the update come down

116
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,100
Yeah, it's OBS 20 just come down and one of the things they're adding is like a totally dynamic

117
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,980
Re-shuffable UI

118
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,660
It's just really it's really they're really that is an open source project that is getting it must be huge in the twitch

119
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,900
Yeah, it's just getting huge. Yeah, it's like every point release adds like a bunch of useful new things

120
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,820
yeah, and I was just looking again for a new webcam and

121
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:55,740
Like a Logitech webcam and on the box now, they're listing OBS support. Oh, that's that's really cool

122
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,940
That's big for the OBS project like Logitech's putting that on the box like so congrats to them

123
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,500
So OBS 20 came out today

124
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,540
Lots of new features if you're looking for a way to do a screen cap and live stream it or even just record it to

125
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,540
A file and maybe also attach a mic into a voiceover the lower third

126
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,780
You know if you just want to even produce an instructional video for work

127
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,000
You could do it in real time and OBS

128
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,680
Instead of instead of putting it together slowly in an editor just do it live

129
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,280
Go through the process like say you're you know

130
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,400
You want to you want to convey some to another another co-worker how to do something on a server?

131
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,920
Just screen cap it with OBS and record the whole thing with attach your mic

132
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,800
And then you have an mp4 file and give it to them and you don't have to use it to live stream your podcast network

133
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,240
You can use it for all kinds of things. Yeah, that's a great point be the next big twitch streamer and

134
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,840
And it's it's really gotten to be super competitive as somebody who's followed, you know these applications for years now and pay thousands and thousands

135
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,840
And thousands of dollars into alternative software

136
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,240
Wirecast um, I mean you can remember back when like you

137
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,240
Couldn't quite switch yet. And now oh, yeah come so far and now here there with version 20. Yeah, we've come so far

138
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm so proud of them. So anyways, you can check that out too. So lots of good stuff, but we do have some apps

139
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,080
I thought maybe we get into some of these so let's

140
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:11,680
Let's take a moment to thank Linux Academy for sponsoring the program Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

141
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,800
It's a platform to learn about Linux built by Linux enthusiasts and it's it really shines because it's all they do

142
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,280
It's what they focus on is Linux and everything around it from the low-level stuff up to the big topic stuff

143
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
They have all kinds of different courseware

144
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,160
Depending on what you're going for if you want something that's self-paced and in-depth

145
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,000
This is perfect

146
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,280
If you want something that can automatically nudge you a little bit to meet your goals

147
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,960
They've got that too. If you just want to get some certifications

148
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:40,940
They have courses created specifically for that and check out this thing. They've recently posted. I don't know if you saw this Wes

149
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
build your own

150
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,120
Linux.com. Oh, it's a site that Linux Academy's put up. I don't know exactly when it's new to me

151
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:57,240
so I think it's kind of new and it is a rundown of how to completely build Linux from scratch using just

152
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,780
the tools that come with the operating system and it's just a

153
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,140
Fantastic way to learn what all this stuff does how it's all put together

154
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,260
It's just it's I mean, it's brilliant. You could go, you know, you could go

155
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,780
Do Linux from scratch or got to Gentoo? That's also an extremely really educational process

156
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:23,100
But the nice thing about this is that it's recent. It's up-to-date. It's well formatted. It's well written and it's extensive

157
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,900
Yeah, it's long. It's you'll spend a while doing this

158
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:31,460
Yeah, and they and they have it in they've broken it down into what our major sections

159
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,420
So they have six major sections and then they have individual

160
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:40,540
Like subcategories in there. This is really this is a massive post so you can find it at buildyourownlinux.com

161
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,780
I mean these guys and cows are really really just intensely passionate about Linux

162
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,500

Thank you everybody for visiting there even just go in there and read it more about Linux Academy

165
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,580
You know, let's him know you heard about it here linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

166
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,860
Everybody loves KDE connect even gnome users are cut KDE connect, right?

167
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:15,700
So this is why I was kind of interested to see M connect integration and KDE connect integration for gnome shell V and extension. Ah

168
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,500
Yes, very very good the KDE connect is a

169
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:27,940
Great app met the developer just really smart guy and just a really handy application

170
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,260
We just talked about it recently as a way to dictate text into your into your Linux box

171
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:38,540
Of course, it allows file sharing notification sharing sending of text messages all other kinds of features

172
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,220
like media playback control and whatnot and

173
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:50,060
there is now an extension that takes all those features of KDE connect and builds them in in a real gnome like way and

174
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,340
It it does all the other kind of stuff you'd expect like if you send files

175
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,860
I'll use Nautilus to do the file transfers. It'll mount the share the phone in Nautilus and

176
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:06,900
It can use if you have your online account connected to Google it can use your Google account contacts to autocomplete SMS messages

177
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:12,380
This is so cool. This is a full-fledged KDE connect integration with gnome shell first. No musers

178
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,380
Well, I'm you know musers going to have to try that

179
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,380
I'll have a link in the show notes Wes if you would like to indulge you can check it out

180
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:25,140
And then well now we're getting to some of these app picks here. So that was the first one now

181
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,340
How about one for everybody Windows users?

182
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,500
Well

183
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,940
You gotta wait a little bit, but everybody else Linux and Mac users you're good

184
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,420
You are good. If you would like to try out alacrity

185
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,580
Alacrity Wes. It's got a powerful name alacrity

186
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,700
It is it is the fastest terminal emulator in existence

187
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,540
It uses all claim it uses the GPU for rendering and why wouldn't it Wes?

188
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,820
I mean you're sitting there with your terminal just wasting your GPU away

189
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,780
Why wouldn't it Wes so alacrity is everyone has videos to render Chris?

190
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,900
They just want to use their GPUs for something. It makes sense. Yeah. Yeah, you got me just sitting there doing nothing

191
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,780
It's a cross-platform. I suppose if you have the free stuff to it work. It's a cross-platform

192
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:17,480
Terminal based on simplicity and performance you got all you got a leg out like a thousand lines of text scrolling across your screen

193
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,140
leg no more my friends it

194
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:28,580
It's also available for a solace users and Ubuntu arched fedora. So can I watch a movie in this terminal now?

195
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
Wait now do you want it to be ASCII?

196
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,260
No

197
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,880
It's GPU accelerated. Why can't it paint an image over the terminal?

198
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:45,660
Maybe you could submit a suggestion is a written in rust to kind of looks like yeah

199
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:49,220
I believe in mention, you know what? You're right. I should always mention when it's right

200
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,220
Should everything I don't know if you should but you see by default, but I oh really? Yeah

201
00:15:53,220 --> 00:16:00,460
Yeah, maybe I just love pushing buttons of rust lovers and if you sudo snap install alacrity dash dash edge

202
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,440
You can install it

203
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,420
Look at that fan to waste this thing has solace build instructions. Yeah, that's what I was interested before then

204
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,980
But no tell me more isn't that something right there? Isn't that somehow?

205
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,940
Yeah, they thought I mean, I knew it had to be roast because that first line. Mm-hmm

206
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,580
They maybe maybe they just figure solace users are the type that might want a GPU

207
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,740
Accelerated terminal because you know, that's gonna be triggering some some listeners out there what I'm sorry

208
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:30,060
What a GPU accelerated terminal? What is it written in an electron? No, it's rust. Calm down

209
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,060
Well, I might just have to package it

210
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,620
Reading the the about here. It sounds like they're taking the the gnome approach of

211
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,780
removing

212
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,260
features though

213
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:47,260
Because it says the simple tab goal means that it has no tabs. Yeah, and

214
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,820
It doesn't have such niceties as like a GUI

215
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,820
Configuration editor. Nope. Nope, it doesn't. However, it does have a nice yaml file

216
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,920
It's easy to follow and with good saying defaults once your GPU accelerated

217
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,580
Why would I want a GUI when I just use my super fast terminal to edit my text file configs?

218
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,220
Yeah, I mean it's obvious. This is this is the way I mean

219
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:16,340
Shh, why else this is alacrity and it's up on github if you'd like to check it out. I actually think it's

220
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,240
It's kind of cool. It's kind of it's actually building it. Are you?

221
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,020
Man, it's even available on BSD. Oh

222
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,300
Really?

223
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,100
Well, I mean they are dead west so they kind of put themselves in the crapper

224
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,440
Anyway, I did I didn't know they had 3d acceleration on BSD now

225
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,420
They must be doing that to the Linux emulation layer probably I would imagine I

226
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,620
I was I was I

227
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,620
Was just teasing BSD guys. You don't have to write me

228
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,060
All right

229
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,380
So that's alacrity and we'll have a link to that in the show notes and then are you ready for your third?

230
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,860
Look how fast we're going through these you guys amazing. We are really doing a good clip

231
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,980
You heard in the show out. So I was uh, I was I started a journey. I

232
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:02,340
Mentioned I would mentioned I stuck around on slack where I was trying out trying out the plasma desktop. I was trying out

233
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:08,740
I also tried installing the latest plasma desktop packages on arch before I reloaded air master from arch

234
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,180
so then I've been thinking about

235
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:19,220
What producer Michael has been saying to me for four months now is he talks about how he has a plasma desktop setup

236
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,540
That's it's actually very kind of gnomish, but it it's plasma

237
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,280
And so I was thinking about like toying with that idea

238
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,780
Is that something I could really do is that something I could sit down and get a nice clean minimal plasma desktop

239
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:38,860
But still have you know that the performance of kwin and the the the tools and of like I like ksnapshot a lot

240
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,840
Console is one of my favorite terminals and you know like a lean kind of run and config. Yeah, so

241
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,940
during this process which eventually

242
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,620
Completely backfired on me, but we'll get to that in a moment. But during this process I landed on

243
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,740
Latte doc now I have become a doc denier. I am a doc denier these days. I

244
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:06,580
I I've got my gnome favorites, you know that come up and that's a doc I suppose but I'm just I'm overdocs

245
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,560
They're an awkward use of screen real estate

246
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:16,000
They they often are dumb like they hide even even even though they call them tele hide and stuff like that

247
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,140
They hide when I don't want them to hide and you know

248
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:24,380
They're just dumb and it's like we've kind of half all gravitated to just you could mash the super key and then you know

249
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:30,780
Yeah application. Yeah, you know really these days I all what I wanted what I want is I want something that lists

250
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:37,020
What my running applications are graphically and lets me click between them and I want something that kind of outlines what virtual desktops

251
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:43,980
I have and bonus points if I can tell what applications are in those virtual desktops, and I really just need something that

252
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,180
Stays out of my way because I'm not really using it to launch new applications

253
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:51,620
I'm not even gonna probably except for a core set of applications

254
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,420
I don't need anything even pinned in it because it like you said I searched I you know, just run it

255
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:02,380
So anyways in this process, I came across latte doc and it's a doc based on plasma frameworks

256
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:09,840
That is pretty nice. It is it's it's animated a little heavily for me by default, but you can turn that down and it has

257
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,180
a

258
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:17,260
Pretty good tweak system that lets you set things that you would normally want to set for a doc and a really smart intuitive

259
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,260
Way like what what edge it's on

260
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:25,540
How it behaves how you add separators it it was nice and you can right-click and you can lock things

261
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,220
It it's not one of these docs that prevents you from getting to the action items of a doc

262
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,620
So like if I right-click on Chrome

263
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:35,820
I still see open new instance opening cognito window from the dock you can somehow put applets down there

264
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:42,460
Although I didn't figure that out. It has really kind of a smooth feel to it. I was able to crash it a couple of times

265
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,140
So I inevitably ended up to not to decide not to use it on my machine

266
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,000
It's on the air, but I really felt like if I was gonna go back to a doc

267
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,900
Latte doc would be the one

268
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,100
It really felt like a it felt like a it wasn't like too compromised it but it wasn't

269
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,500
Overly done. It wasn't it wasn't overly built

270
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,060
It was just it was just really kind of smooth and straightforward

271
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:12,260
It has a couple of really nice features in the version that just came out four days ago version 0.7

272
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:16,380
Oh, it has a wayland support preview, which is probably a good direction to go

273
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,200
It has a new layout editor, which I liked quite a bit. There is a new dynamic background

274
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,700
option that dynamically switches when a window is maximized versus

275
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:32,740
Windowed which just makes it look really nice. And that's pretty sounds like yeah, there's there's all little things. They've added that

276
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:39,260
Oh, oh, oh, I should probably mention this because my favorite one an audio streams indicator is now built into the dock

277
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:44,300
Oh, yes, you could increase decrease volume or even mute volume right from the top

278
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,180
Yeah that I really appreciate it. Maybe ducks are making their way back

279
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,140
That's latte doc latte doc for you plasma desktop users. I

280
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,540
Think it's pretty good. And so I

281
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,560
got plasma desktop install and I got it configured and I got a latte doc set up but

282
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,300
You know

283
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,040
It just doesn't it doesn't quite click with me

284
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,400
It doesn't there's something about the cute

285
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,520
applications the complicated aspect of them that a lot of the little tweaking that I was gonna have to do and I was doing this an

286
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,120
hour before the show started

287
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,120
Not in your tweekiest mood. I

288
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,800
Yeah, yeah, I ended up I ended up

289
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,640
deciding to just take the solace plunge and I

290
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:36,320
I went and grabbed the budgie ISO and I etched that to a to a thumb drive put it in the machine installed it

291
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,840
just just cleared out my old partitions and left my data partitions alone and

292
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,920
Just went all-in on budgie right now. So we're set up. I'm on the live stream. I'm on Firefox 55, too

293
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,520
So it's not only that I switched to solace, but I switched to Firefox

294
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,900
Why would you want to stay still that's just no

295
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,200
You know for me it was it was sort of the best of both worlds because I like the GTK applications

296
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,880
I I am very familiar with gnome settings and those settings applets. So they for me

297
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,320
It's just sort of a nice sort of familiarity

298
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,720
I like the new art and and look that we're gonna talk about a little bit in the new version of soul

299
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,320
So that's the other thing. Of course. It's a new release as well came out today

300
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,120
So those all kind of played a role but for me what it finally was is it just seemed like

301
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,200
Well, I'm gonna take a I'm gonna take a little bit of a gnome breather

302
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,880
But this is a good stepping stone because it's it's all of the GTK apps that I know and love

303
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,800
It's all of the themes and icon sets that I know and love comfortable with

304
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:39,520
Yeah, super comfortable with the terminal comfortable with all that stuff. I'm I've even learned to use current Nautilus

305
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,560
files

306
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:47,560
But it's it's things like it's mutter and it seems like the the size of gnome shell and all of these things that I've just added

307
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,140
To it over time. It's not even necessarily all gnomes fault

308
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,320
and so but the budgie desktop was sort of this nice sort of stepping stone to not completely switching away from GTK, but

309
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:03,280
Because sort of stepping away from some of the things have been causing me issues recently to wean you off of it

310
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:08,280
Yeah, and so latte doc doesn't really have a spot on on a GTK desktop so much

311
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,280
But if you were if I was gonna go to a plasma desktop

312
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,840
I think I would I would consider replacing the main panel that the plasma desktop uses

313
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,640
Yeah, but so we do need to talk about solace though. That's the way I think we have

314
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,360
We've talked enough about community updates and app picks

315
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:30,280
but if you want to see any of those things we talked about today, we have links in the show notes latte doc also kind of

316
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,280
cool is one of those

317
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,560
Useful plasma applications that you can actually just install from the from the plasma store quote-unquote

318
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,360
And I and it's kind of sort of distro agnostic

319
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,480
Which is which is pretty cool

320
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,600
So you can just you don't necessarily have to go find the show notes

321
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,440
You could just search around in the plasma desktop or whatever. They call it store and install it there

322
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:57,200
How about that was that so easy? How's your build going? It's still building. Is it? Well, I think I'm installing

323
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,400
I'm still a bunch of rust dependencies now. It's a wild ride

324
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,520
Good good. Well, I'm glad see I got I have installs going in the background right now. You've got installs

325
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,480
This is one of those episodes where we're all users. Damn it. Yeah, we're installing our software while we do the show today

326
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,600
And y'all hey, that's what's part of the fun

327
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,920
That's why we do it fresh open-source software right at our love. We love drunk on the power

328
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,640
We love it

329
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,480
and you know what there's more and more software coming and some of them are getting wrapped up now in these universal package formats and

330
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,820
Aiki and the souls project just announced support for snaps along with flat packs which already existed

331
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,440
But it's not just like baby support. It's full grown-up proper sandboxed support

332
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,680
So we're gonna talk about that with him and we're gonna pick mr

333
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:47,800
Whippers whimpers his brain as well because I believe there was a little cross collab involved to get some of that stuff working

334
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,160
So I want to figure out what all of that was and get the scoop on that

335
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,800
So let's take a moment and thank digital ocean digital ocean comm go over there

336
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,400
Create your account and then use our promo code of ultimate power do unplugged do

337
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,920
Unplugged one word will give you a ten dollar credit over that digital ocean comm now

338
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,040
They got a five dollar rig five dollar rig for five dollars

339
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:12,640
You could run that rig two months for free with our promo code do unplug cuz I got a five dollar rig

340
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:19,600
That's nuts. I can't even get a burger for five dollars. I might be able to get the fish sandwich for five dollars

341
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
But what you know you want to?

342
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,640
Exactly, but you know what that five dollars much better spent over digital ocean premium

343
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:33,120
You can spin up a droplet in less than 55 seconds all SSDs for the hard drives 40 gigabit connections coming to the hypervisor

344
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,280
Linux for the server they have KVM for that hypervisor, which is brilliant

345
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,440
They have a dashboard for days

346
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,200
That's super easy to use they have an API that straightforward brilliant

347
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,040
And it's so well developed that they use it themselves to build their own

348
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,320
Systems on top of digital ocean then they have all kinds of really crazy advanced features like block storage

349
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,760
And they're working on object storage right now

350
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:00,600
They have firewalls that deploy at the network level so the traffic you want to reject never even reaches your system

351
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,560
They have load balancing as a service

352
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:08,320
Monitoring alerting where you get metrics and alerts when things go down and of course they have entire stacks of pre-built

353
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:14,920
Open-source applications ready to go with a single click or you know you just build it from scratch yourself

354
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,320
I was gonna say does that sound too easy. Don't worry. Just install free

355
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,160
What you're doing and you'll have it

356
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,040
Yeah, if you get stuck you just email those BSD now guys

357
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,800
This is the way I go is when I'm just trying out something like either for the show

358
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:36,640
Or I want to play with something or a new release of a distro comes out that I want to throw on a server

359
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:44,800
They have a three cents an hour machine three cents an hour machine easy to justify that is that is and then find some

360
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,720
Spare change in your couch. Yeah, throw it on the floor well deal unplugged

361
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,160
Yeah, you get the $10 credit you could run that three cents an hour you get that for quite a while

362
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,240
And you know you could you could destroy and create a couple of machines in that time. It's great

363
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,880
It's just so much fun to play around with to or to put it in production

364
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,040
They got data centers all over the world so you get something nice and fast wherever you your users are at

365
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,760
DigitalOcean.com use the promo code do unplugged big

366
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,920
Thank you digital ocean also while you're over there go over to their community section and look at the open source projects

367
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,400
Built around digital ocean digital ocean calm use the promo code do unplug

368
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,700
So I key welcome back to the show sir it is really good to talk to you

369
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,440
And I don't think you've been on the show since you've gone full-time either although

370
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,720
We talked right before you did go full-time, but congrats on the transition. It looks like time has been well spent

371
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
Congratulations

372
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,920
Solus 3 is out, and I got it loaded right here on my machine

373
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:45,120
And we look it is looking really great, so I I guess let's start there cuz that's like the big

374
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:51,080
That's like the big story. I noticed that you got Firefox 55 in the sucker and man is that fast, but

375
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,920
I didn't realize this before and I guess last time I tried souls

376
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:01,800
I just maybe didn't notice or I forgot but Solus 3 is using the Linux LTS kernel and

377
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,360
That was actually what pushed me over the edge because I've been thinking more and more about using

378
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,140
LTS core stuff for our production machines

379
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,760
but having faster moving applications like Chrome and OBS and

380
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,840
So when I saw the fact that I could pin it to LTS, which is the default

381
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,040
I could use current, but it was it was pinned to LTS. It's default on the existing ones

382
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,000
So so in the new ones it's so we have two kernel branches

383
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,660
I mean back in the old days pre-clear bit manager

384
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,560
We just had one kernel and it sucked and if you updated you were screwed

385
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,960
And then we spent ages. I mean basically it updated the same way as our trying

386
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,700
We know how that goes. My modules are gone. It was that same story

387
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:51,480
But nowadays we have the next current Linux LTS the next LTS basically follows a great branch

388
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So that's gonna update again in September to 4.14 and then it's gonna stay on that for a long time

389
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,860
Yeah, and then it'll update again

390
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,820
So users can now freely have them both installed and then they can go between them

391
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,140
We've got all the Nvidia drivers for both of them as well. So you can quite happily you don't have to build them

392
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,140
There's no DKMS none of this

393
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:16,100
You know pixie blood crap, dude. You haven't got to go through that so you can just pick every one of them

394
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,260
This new ISO is defaulting to the Linux current branch

395
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,840
Which is basically the stable kernel most of the time, right?

396
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,020
But there might be times when we say and we don't want to update it. So we're not gonna call it Linux

397
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:35,400
So are you saying with clear root manager you made the switch from shipping LTS is default to shipping current is default

398
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,620
No

399
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,020
Yes, I know so the the ISO itself is now using the Linux current package

400
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,900
Which means it's on four point twelve point seven, right?

401
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:50,500
But because we now use clear boot manager you can use either we can have any current

402
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:56,460
What I opted to do which I think is great because and then all the envy of the you have the appropriate Nvidia packages to

403
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,900
Match up. So it was just really easy. Yeah, it was really straightforward

404
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,820
Nice, so okay. So I just that was something I really like okay now, you know what?

405
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,820
I'm gonna do the LTS kernel. I'm gonna go with that

406
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:11,980
So let's talk about some of the stuff that's in that kernel that that made snap packages possible

407
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,500
Let's start there

408
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,620
Maybe because I think didn't you have to make some pretty low-level changes for the sandboxing support must have required at least app armor

409
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:25,360
Yeah, so that basically there are there are app armor patches that have gone up for four point thirteen and four point fourteen

410
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,460
The canonical guys are very diligent in getting all that stuff upstream

411
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:34,340
But you know that that stuff does take time a fair amount of it has gone upstream

412
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:39,220
But it's it's not all there. So for the two kernels, I've back parted from

413
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:46,500
Zesty and artful. I've basically back parted their implementations of app armor, which are the future upstream ones

414
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:53,500
Which means that solace is now using the exact same implementation of app armor that a bunch of is using that's bad

415
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:58,980
Which also means that we're the only over dish at the time of saying this

416
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:06,840
I want to be very specific about that at the time of saying this we're the only non-abundant to the next distribution to have

417
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,900
full snap confinement

418
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:15,620
Like as a like for like with a bun too, right? That's awesome. Well, there'd be a nine has it as well

419
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,420
Well shipped

420
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,620
How did this come about so

421
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:28,820
Um, okay. Well, it's his fault. Well, I thought so but I mean you're also

422
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,900
You have your position has evolved on this but for some people listening to this show though

423
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,900
They'll remember you as the anti flat pack anti snap guy

424
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,260
Yeah, I mean

425
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,660
I'm you know, like a whole thing about having the angel and devil in your ears, right? Sure

426
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:52,420
Wimpy has become the the angel in the air and I've got about four of my own devils in here the whole time, but

427
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,620
When we first decided on it

428
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:54,860
I mean

429
00:32:54,860 --> 00:33:00,700
it was it was a long time ago when the whole debate started coming about and it took a long time for facts to

430
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:06,260
Change and facts have changed, you know, and there's certain things would have accelerated it, you know

431
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,140
But now snap is looking to be the agnostic agnostic platform that everyone

432
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,820
Needs to support now from the solos perspective when we first went for a flat pack

433
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:23,300
It was basically replaced the aging crappy third party, which you had the pleasure of enjoying recently

434
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:30,100
Yeah, that is a bit of a it is a bit of an uncomfortable. It sucks. It sucks. So you want something that you know

435
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:35,580
Something just works for the users, you know, like minimal friction and when we first said, oh, you know

436
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,360
We're gonna go for flat back

437
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:44,540
It was we wanted the least invasive change and I guess it was basically bang for buck at the time with least amount of

438
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,580
You're essentially getting it with GTK to

439
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:54,140
Known world, wasn't it? You know, you bring in OS tree. Well that depends on GLib world

440
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:59,060
We have all this stuff, you know, that would have been easy enough and it's a C known library essentially

441
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:04,420
But I mean since that time and it's got to be six plus months eight months or something like that now

442
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:11,560
It's it's changed a lot and then nowadays flat pack is more about these runtimes very much about these runtimes

443
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:16,260
But as a vendor, I mean, we're effectively an OS V. We have no say

444
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,020
We have no influence there and there are times when we're gonna want to add value

445
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,700
So you can imagine to draw a parallel if you're a Samsung and you're manufacturing Chromebooks

446
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,860
You're gonna want to add value on for your customers, right?

447
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:35,260
You're gonna want that value at not just shipping that we want the opportunity of we're doing things with third-party

448
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,620
applications to actually enhance that and

449
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,820
Do cool things today with the solace room. I want to pause you there. So because I think that

450
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,940
Comparison will probably make a lot of people sort of wretch a little bit because it sounds

451
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,860
Value add right? Yeah, right

452
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,800
What about using discord as an example there because I think discord is an example where a lot of distributions sort of just got

453
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,540
Screwed a little bit. Mm-hmm. And I think I think if you are like this is what I was thinking

454
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:06,300
I key is the thing about solace is you guys are really on top of packaging when you do decide to package something like you

455
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:11,500
Really think it through and it's you commit to it. So discord was pretty quickly fixed and

456
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,780
There was a dependency that discord all of a sudden required

457
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,760
And of course it also required to be running on a current version

458
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,800
This is you know, this is the way these things go

459
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,080
especially new applications, especially for vendors that are still learning how to support Linux and

460
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:31,140
In my experience solace handled that pretty much the best and was able to get the additional dependencies

461
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:36,200
Bundled in there and shipped and pushed down to the end-users and fix the problem pretty quickly, but

462
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:42,200
It does kind of raise the argument for I mean there is the whole thing if you're an application developer

463
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,680
I mean, we all like to give them a lot of problems, you know

464
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:50,320
Like they're not bringing this stuff over to Linux, but there is the whole part of which Linux do you target?

465
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,560
It's like the joke I made about solace. Which arm would we target?

466
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,480
Well, it's kind of the same for which Linux would you go for so?

467
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:03,260
You given them a common target that they can all go for that just happens to run on all the Linux distributions

468
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,180
It makes a lot of sense

469
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:10,420
So I'm not interested in in terms so much of the open-source software because well you can distribute that anyway

470
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:15,300
Sure, but stuff that we can't distribute and to give an example I can now

471
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:22,060
Well bad example, but I can run next cloud on my local box for testing for snap. That's all fully managed

472
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,100
That's not something we're ever gonna package in solace

473
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,380
How would it change in Chrome like if there was an official Google Chrome snap or flat pack?

474
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:31,900
How would that change distributing that for you? So I mean it comes straight from the vendor

475
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:37,440
Which is a great thing and in many ways snap operates a little bit like a package manager

476
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,380
Anyway, in terms of there are indexes and there are updates and there are these blobs that it goes to fetch when we do it

477
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:49,360
Now we've got to go to our third-party repo and effectively mark the new URL for the original deb file

478
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:55,500
And then put the hash in there. That's you know, we basically some said I try to install Chrome it failed

479
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,900
That's how we know that sucks. Yeah, I mean I really really suck. So there's no update

480
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:07,700
There's no automatic update for snap kind of takes that away in the the software vendors can be responsible

481
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:12,060
I mean regardless of the application they can be responsible for when their stuff goes out

482
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:18,420
They can test it themselves before it actually gets to the distributions and there are built-in update mechanisms as well

483
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,740
So being able to swap out the hacky I was tracking it stuff versus

484
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,660
These vendors would want to put out their own software and say well

485
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,300
This is what you're getting then it takes the pressure off of everyone in that circle

486
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:36,460
So what going back to flat pack and snap one of the things that does sort of stand out is it sounds like to do

487
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:41,100
full-fledged proper big boy matching Ubuntu snap support

488
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:47,000
It was a bit more work than flat pack because you just sort of you sort of just got flat pack

489
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,400
Reflecting on that did did snaps

490
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,320
Focus on not just desktop, but also including server software. Was that a motivating factor here?

491
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,280
Because well traditionally that'd be a weaker area for solace, right? So if snap, yeah, we're desktop

492
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,040
yeah, but this could sort of fill in gaps that

493
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,080
Solace has right now that you know

494
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:14,440
If some user wanted to run say sab NZB on their solar system, and there's a snap for that

495
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,440
I

496
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
Mean a lot of it's Martin's fault

497
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,200
I mean there's stuff that we can't distribute but not only that

498
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:31,440
There's stuff that we won't distribute and that was the angle that Martin was taking this like

499
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:37,480
There's gonna be stuff that your inclusion policy is just not gonna go for but some people are gonna need and from the solace

500
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,360
Perspective, it's sometimes it's gonna be a bit like a get out of jail free card instead of just saying to people

501
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:45,520
No, no, we're not putting this in and then everyone's unhappy

502
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,520
it's like however, you know, there is this over approach that you can go that you can go the snap route and

503
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,400
the the other part of it is that basically

504
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,760
the the snap craft and the Ubuntu teams have

505
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:03,220
Very much been there over the last few days and I think we started on something like the Thursday or Friday or something like that

506
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,360
But in the end we wanted the first day I got back from holiday

507
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:13,040
Yeah, and it was like two days later. We got to the point where we actually had the first kernel patched

508
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,440
So it was the next current kernel and we had the full confinement and on the next morning

509
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,520
We then had compatibility with classic confinement as well

510
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,400
What is so without that help?

511
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,520
When be can you explain the difference between confinement and classic confinement?

512
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,600
Okay, so there's three confinement models

513
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:39,760
now there's dev mode which is what you start with when you're creating your snap at the beginning and that tears down much of the

514
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:46,760
Confinement and then when you actually want to publish your snap, you've got two confinement options. There's strict confinement

515
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,840
Which means the application is entirely sandboxed and only has access to the things that you define

516
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:59,880
Via the snap craft yaml. So think of it like a firewall. You've got this application in a sandbox

517
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,360
This application needs access to your webcam

518
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,640
so in the yaml you tell it it can access the webcam and there are

519
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:14,560
Dozens of interfaces to give applications discrete access to different things on the host operating system

520
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,800
usually hardware devices

521
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,840
And so when it's strictly confined it can only access those things that you've prescribed it can access

522
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:31,680
and it can also only access files within its snap or if you add a home interface to a

523
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:38,320
Sandboxed portion of your home directory. So even if you have the home interface enabled you can't see

524
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,080
files and dot folders

525
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:46,840
From the snap and that's to prevent the snap being used to maliciously get it, you know

526
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,240
GPG keys and things of that nature

527
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,760
so so what was so what was required sort of

528
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,920
On a back end. What is missing? What is missing it for Linux distributions to support this?

529
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,120
Well to support what exactly this confinement

530
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,960
Well

531
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,600
That you need a palmer basically. That's sort of the more controversial thing about this

532
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:16,520
Is that some people don't want to roll out so much? I mean openSUSE are using app armor

533
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:21,240
Yeah, I keep us in the position where he hadn't chosen an LSM at this point

534
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,240
So I see Linux

535
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,280
What then I say they make great software

536
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,560
But some part of the problem is that classic confinement is

537
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,760
basically

538
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,480
Allowing a snap to run pretty much without any confinement whatsoever

539
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,980
So there are specific use cases for classic confinement. So for example

540
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:54,380
a liquidity that we mentioned earlier is a classic snap because it's a terminal and it needs to execute

541
00:41:54,780 --> 00:42:00,220
Shell commands from arbitrary locations on your hard drive. So that means no confinement has

542
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,900
So well

543
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:08,040
It has to have no confinement over what it can see on your hard disk because it has to be able to execute arbitrary things

544
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,780
And compilers, you know

545
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:16,740
If you want to snap a language or a compiler that almost certainly has to be classic for the same reasons. So

546
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:21,900
But then the the trick here is the way that snapd works is that

547
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,320
snaps and everything to do with snap sit under

548
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,020
snap in the root of the file system and

549
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,220
some

550
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,920
distros have elected to not follow that

551
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,660
requirement and

552
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:44,820
Relocate snaps elsewhere on the file system and at that point it breaks the opportunity to run classic snaps at all

553
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:53,660
Okay, so this to me to me it seems like it's maybe just a little it's it's a little bit

554
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:58,860
It's a little confusing because there's a lot. There's a lot of parts there, but it sounds like pretty simply

555
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,100
Simply put if it's done if it's done properly

556
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:07,700
You can have you could still have a you can have a system that fully fully supports confined snaps

557
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:12,440
But the snap if set up could not be confined

558
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:18,220
Yes, okay, I think I got it. Okay interesting. So what was behind the scenes?

559
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:22,220
What was the work between say yourself and I key to get this working on solace?

560
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:27,860
Well, I am I've really been a glorified cheerleader in this whole process

561
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:34,780
And a go-between so I think I heard I key say on

562
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:40,360
Late night Linux a few weeks ago that he was open to

563
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,460
Using snaps and my ears pricked up and I thought

564
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,420
So I immediately got on telegram

565
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:57,220
And we started to have a conversation and then I

566
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:05,220
Had a chat with some of the guys at work and we identified a few people who would have some time to assist and

567
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,780
We waited for I key to

568
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:12,460
Make his transition to working on solace as his full-time

569
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:19,880
Endeavor and then I key got busy doing his release business and then last week

570
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:24,220
We made the introductions with I key and the other guys in the team

571
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:30,080
And I was basically just standing on the sidelines applauding and cheering enthusiastically at that point. I

572
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,020
Loved how it came out I key, you know

573
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:39,620
Starts with that it started the Google plus post and I just sit there and I go this this son of a bitch

574
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:47,420
Well, I did drop hints to it on the last time I was sort of dropped hints that it yeah

575
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:53,300
It was sort of in the back of my head. But yeah, well, I've a habit of doing this as an end user now

576
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:58,840
Is there really anything I do? Do I just snap a snap installed on the you have a stop installed already? Yeah

577
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:05,640
Okay. Well, there you go. So you can just do pseudo snap installed brave dash dash beta. Oh brave really?

578
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:12,780
Yeah, so we wasn't really looking forward to packaging brave results. It's another thing. It's electronic

579
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,740
So the syntax is pseudo snap installed

580
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:22,060
Mm-hmm. Yeah, brave brave and then dash beta dash dash. It's a dash. Yeah, that's right

581
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,380
I'm a noob

582
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,060
Sold a couple of snaps, but not many

583
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:33,180
There we go. It's downloading right now. It's a good example because it's fully confined. Oh

584
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:37,020
And it will also use the open GL interface as well

585
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:41,500
Which means that we've actually got a couple of fixes going in at the moment now

586
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:47,180
We're going back and forth from the polar crates but some of the stuff like the way that we have the open gel libraries on

587
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,760
Solos is laid out basically the same as they would be on arts Linux

588
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:54,620
So the stuff that we're doing now because we have the full confinement

589
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:59,260
We're finding books that arts Linux will have by the time it gets full confinement

590
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,260
So we're fixing their books before they happen, which is kind of cool

591
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,020
Yeah, this is another advantage of getting

592
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:13,640
What is probably and I mean this with love I keep the most foreign Linux distribution

593
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:18,500
Yeah running snaps because you're you are trailblazing in many ways

594
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:26,020
It's a very opinionated Linux. Yeah, you're going to bump into things. Yeah, well it will it show up now in my

595
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:31,500
How does that show up in your menu does it now fight, but I do brave. I see nothing. I see nothing

596
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:38,060
I see nothing, but if I can if budgie menu is being an idiot, then you can use another feature of budgie all an f2. Oh

597
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,580
alt

598
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:41,940
f2

599
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:46,980
Aha, I see. Yes. I need to learn that that's gonna be my new favorite feature. I do need that

600
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,500
That's Brian from the solos team told me that I had to tell you that

601
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:56,020
So I've been looking to slip that one in that is really good. I really do like that. All right, so I'm waiting

602
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,700
I'm waiting. I'm not seeing all so it's alt f2. Oh, there we go

603
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:03,780
Yeah, just type in brave and it should be there. Yeah, it just it just it just popped up

604
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,780
Yeah, the first time you launch any snap it takes slightly longer

605
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:12,300
Because it's setting everything up in the back end, you know, like for the next time it runs

606
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:19,180
It's got all these policies and everything. But the next time you run it should basically be instant. Yeah, and that that first run

607
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,740
Latency is something we're addressing as well. So that will go away in time

608
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:29,340
What a perfect way to play with something like brave this is because you just if you have snap support

609
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,980
you can you can do that same command and you can be messing around with it and it's

610
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,940
This is this is probably you know, a browser is a perfect example of an application

611
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,060
That should be you can test the sandbox in though

612
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:45,360
So if you go on right click on something and was to do like a save as to get the file dialog pop up

613
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,920
Try navigating to one of the folders that you're not allowed to go to

614
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:54,600
So like your root folder or back into your real home folder. Sure. So we'll go let's try going to

615
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,280
Other locations computer. Oh

616
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,860
Yeah, no, it's basically this is screw you you can't go there

617
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,560
interesting

618
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,760
Interesting. In fact, yeah now this is this is an interesting

619
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,520
Notion this sandboxing of browsers because if you've ever run s trace whilst

620
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,920
You have what if you've had you got

621
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:26,960
Firefox installed and you start Chrome for the first time and you have s trace on the Chrome process

622
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:34,340
You will see Chrome going grubbing around all over Firefox looking for stuff really and if they

623
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,680
Know if you've got these in set each of them as sandboxed

624
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:44,920
Snaps, then you can't have that happen. So I know if you're that's interesting

625
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,920
Sorry to interrupt. I noticed though. So

626
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,160
What about theming support guys? What is the what is the story there?

627
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,920
I went finish your thought if you were if you're gonna finish something

628
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,960
But just after you do finish it, I'd be curious to know what the what the story is with theming

629
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,780
No, no, I've made my point about you know stopping applications from you know snooping on that is really nice. Yeah

630
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,240
But in terms of theme support that was something so a few weeks ago

631
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:15,080
we had a sprint in London a snap sprint in London and there a number of people from the

632
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,480
community invited to that from you know, KDE and elementary and

633
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,040
gnome and all sorts and one of the

634
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:31,520
Tracks we did there was how we're going to improve the theme support and that's currently being worked on

635
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,680
So we did the design there and that's that's in progress seems like a challenge

636
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:40,680
That seems like a real challenge if it's supposed to be isolated and all of that. I mean that seems yeah

637
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:46,980
There's there's a number of cool new bits of tech coming to make all of this magic happen

638
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,080
But we fleshed out how to handle

639
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,960
themes fonts and icons in a way that you can

640
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,680
Interconnect them and what?

641
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,600
and

642
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:02,560
So something that I can I've discussed and so what you need to know is I key knows things

643
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:09,720
He can't talk about at the moment and I heard him so hard podcast a couple of days ago

644
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:14,720
And I could tell that I key wasn't sure if this thing that he knew he could talk about or not

645
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:19,440
No, as it happens he can so I key was interviewed on oven to fun

646
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:26,780
Podcast which is a German language podcast, but fortunately I key was interviewed in English, which I can just about hope with

647
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:34,180
Yes, and one of the things that I key was alluding to is just talking about how solace could add value to the snap

648
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:35,940
ecosystem

649
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,980
And he wasn't able to articulate what he meant exactly and I'll explain

650
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:48,700
so at the moment when you install a snap for the first time a core snap gets installed and that core snap is a

651
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:56,180
Very thin Ubuntu runtime so a very small shim of user space

652
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,880
Which also has snap D

653
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:07,060
Embedded inside it. So when you're running brave at the moment, you actually have this very thin Ubuntu

654
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:14,500
Layer and then the snap sits on top of that. So effectively it's an Ubuntu runtime that you're using

655
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,500
alongside

656
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,700
solace

657
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:22,680
But what we're doing is we're going to introduce this concept of base snaps

658
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:29,120
So the core snap would just become snap D and the bits that it needs

659
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,980
Not that will be the new core

660
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:36,660
So very very small and then the base snap will be that thin shim of runtime

661
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:41,780
So the default will be the Ubuntu runtime the default the default

662
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:46,500
Yeah, but we're going to add a facility in the yaml to say base

663
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,380
colon

664
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:54,420
solace and if Aiki creates a base snap based on the solace runtime

665
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,140
somebody

666
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:04,540
Somebody could create a snap which is built on top of that solace runtime

667
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:10,660
and when that snap is installed on Ubuntu you would get that solace base underneath and

668
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:16,100
Then the application sitting on top and this will be something that you know

669
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:23,140
Any of the distros can do to create their own base snaps and Aiki can explain why he thinks this will be a useful feature

670
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,580
Optimized optimized libraries. It's gonna be awesome games and stuff. It's gonna be great

671
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,060
Interesting. I just wanted to get that out

672
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:34,780
I mean it could mean you know, we could also mean a lot of Ubuntu users now can have better libraries

673
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,780
Thanks to solace in a way, you know

674
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,860
I mean like doing a reverse, but now I don't need to switch. I don't need to switch to solace. Yeah

675
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,020
It is a reverse team. It's exactly a reverse team

676
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,940
Revengeous suite. Yeah, that's good. I can see I can see it

677
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:49,660
And it could you could also see for the fedora project if there was something

678
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:53,820
It made the most sense to build on top of or you're there's a great angle for this as well. I mean

679
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,700
It's all Travis actually Martin. I'll let you talk about though

680
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,300
Well, what what what do I know about Travis?

681
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:05,700
I'm just saying Travis like tools are say

682
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,380
What's the other one coveralls and things like that?

683
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,900
Invariably you end up with older stuff

684
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,820
But say like at the moment

685
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,100
I'm having to use Docker to build some of my stuff in tree

686
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:21,300
Because I don't want to use some of the online services because they're using like a bunch of maverick and stuff like that

687
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:23,980
So instead of having like a heavyweight Docker image

688
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:28,220
Which is gonna take me about 10 to 15 minutes to build from a tarball of something

689
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:31,580
I would then be able to use my solace devel

690
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:37,100
Kind of snap locally to build budgie and then I could use like the Ubuntu one to build it

691
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:42,700
So I can do all of my local tests without then having to go through VMs and heavyweight Docker and stuff

692
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,340
So yeah, yeah, that's something I'm very much looking forward to

693
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:52,300
Yeah, especially for something like budgie as well where you're using like four or five different GTK versions. It's gonna be a godsend

694
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:58,460
Yeah, and you know, yeah, I've I've I've installed solace on my intro where Apollo

695
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:02,100
And I'm able to do my day job on solace now

696
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:09,220
Because I can snap install Docker and I can snap install snap craft and I can snap install Lex D

697
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:13,120
And although I'm sitting on top of solace now

698
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:20,060
I can use all of the tools that I need from the you know, the Ubuntu world on this solar system

699
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,420
Just fine. Yeah, that's awesome

700
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,420
We're converging. Yeah, and in

701
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,020
and I suppose in some ways at the end and you know

702
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:33,660
When I look what I think about a lot of these applications with some of the exceptions that wimpy just put out there

703
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,780
I a lot of the things that I would be using these for

704
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:42,200
Are applications that never have any interest in being in anybody's repo?

705
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:47,060
They're never gonna be an OBS there then it's just not what they're interested in

706
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:52,940
They they develop in a paradigm that is Windows and Mac and on Windows and Mac you have your base OS

707
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:56,020
And then you just drop your application down on top of it

708
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:01,300
If you needed your own libraries, you just include them screw with the OS ships. Here's your library link to it

709
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,220
You're good to go

710
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,800
It's all in a bundle and you drop it on the file system

711
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,340
and then when you do a new update you just drop new versions of all that crap right over the old crap on the

712
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,620
file system and this is how they've done it for

713
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,100
going on almost 30 years now and

714
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:18,180
And there's some applications that even though that's changing

715
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:21,620
That's that's the culture in which they are created

716
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:28,100
That's where they come from and they're never going to they're never going to work with the solace

717
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,980
Maintainers to package it up, you know

718
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:34,820
Like look at look at just all the applications out there that people are using these days

719
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:39,500
When you look at a desktop with Skype and slack and all these different applications people use

720
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,780
these are just

721
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,960
this

722
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:47,620
This is just what happens when that kind of application starts coming to the Linux desktop

723
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:52,680
They're not going to just change their philosophy and start going to each distribution and say please sir

724
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:57,540
Could you please distribute slack for me? Could you please distribute this to your users this new update?

725
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:03,660
Could you please distribute it soon? Because it's a vulnerability and we need it fixed and we had to fix something on server side

726
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,820
So if you don't get this client code out there, we can't flip the server side

727
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:11,260
So could you please work over the weekend and push that out to all of your users? Mr. Debbie and maintainer?

728
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:14,620
Like that's just that's it's never ever going to happen

729
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:21,020
So I fix that yeah, so that's why you know, I don't think it's I

730
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:25,860
Agree with Ikea. I don't think it's I don't think it's the biggest problem facing Linux right now

731
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:30,180
I really don't but I I do think it's where we are converging

732
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:35,540
It's making it easier for people to use Linux as a platform to get their shit done. And I think that's really important

733
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:40,300
I think that's the important part. There is now an emergent platform something that hasn't happened for a long time

734
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:45,100
Yeah, if you look at any of the over operating systems, I mean you look at the stack that's evolved on Mac OS

735
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,100
There's a very much an emergent platform there

736
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:53,960
Linux hasn't had one you've had all these disconnected targets and toolkits and libraries and the API's and standards

737
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:57,380
And now all of a sudden this thing is just starting to bubble up to the surface

738
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:02,260
it's like a common target a common set of runtimes a common set of expectations and

739
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:09,100
You know like where does the kernel end the word is distro begin? That's becoming very very clearly defined now

740
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:12,420
So it's it's getting to a point now where we could say

741
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:19,140
Okay, if we added more stuff to bring these developers across it's it the deployment issue is basically gone

742
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:24,460
We have something to resolve one problem. Here's what you can target. Here's the world that you can live in

743
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:28,060
You have reasonable expectations or any expectation and I could yeah

744
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:31,860
I mean now we can actually bend over for them, you know bend over backwards for the software

745
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:38,420
Developers because before it's like oh, well, we can't have your application in because then that means we got to go patch QT

746
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:43,260
But that version of Q is needed by that thing. We couldn't possibly do that because our users unit

747
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:48,660
It's like now they can just say well, I'm just gonna do what I do on Windows and ship this patch version to keep with it

748
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:53,140
We were never gonna stop these people from doing up and now they got away doing that

749
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:59,140
Yeah, well and you know what sounds like these proposed changes to sort of separate out the the snap processes versus the base

750
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,780
Runtime area means it's not even it's not even an Ubuntu solution anymore

751
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:09,900
It can just be a Linux solution. And if your Linux is solace or your Linux is SUSE, you're good

752
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:15,280
So that's pretty great too. So before we go before we wrap up I key, you know

753
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,680
I got a you got a because you've just released a new version. My favorite question to always ask

754
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:23,260
Is well now what's next

755
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,680
You know you now that you've just spent all of that time and effort getting that out the door

756
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,340
Next what's next? Come on. Give me what's next?

757
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:38,060
Um, so there's a few things. Okay, so there's an immediate work list to be done after we call it the

758
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,940
It's the meta list the post release blues

759
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:46,300
One of the first things we got to do is slightly improve our

760
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:51,760
Basically our pipeline to make us go more faster. That's one of the primary goals going forward

761
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:59,220
Dropping some standard stuff like the older web kits and rebasing system D, you know the the boring stuff sure

762
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:05,460
But it's now it's the sort of the time where for solace for we're going to be focusing on the OEM enabling

763
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:10,780
We're talking to people already and the installer is going to get split up to support an OEM workflow

764
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,140
Which would be very very good

765
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:17,660
Linux driver manager is actually going back into active development

766
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:22,880
Which doesn't mean the dynamic optimus GPU support will be coming this year. Hurrah

767
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,180
I'm supposed to drop a bombshell aren't I?

768
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:33,660
We're all gonna put weight behind the KD plasma stack this year as well. Really? So that's getting brought up

769
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:40,860
I am willing to permit an out-of-band release for our kitty. Yes that I'm looking forward to seeing that

770
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:44,740
I really am. I mean, I mean lots of stuff coming this year. Not just

771
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:49,940
Yeah, I saw you put you basically put a chart up online that says these are a lot of the things we're working on

772
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:52,460
Right now and there's a lot of core infrastructure stuff you're working on

773
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:56,460
Yeah, I mean one of the things that's kind of been bugging me like as a distribution

774
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:59,540
We say these are the rules for things that can come into our repos, you know

775
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:05,460
And sometimes not everyone has agreed with our reasons for things going into the repos

776
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:10,800
But one of the things that's interested me is building the best-in-class pipeline

777
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:15,140
I am interested in building something that's effectively a source to deployment

778
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:21,000
Pipeline so once that tarball or sources or that stuff goes into the distribution

779
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,320
We're scanning at that level first before it goes anywhere else. So we're gonna be doing static analysis

780
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:35,040
We even like license calculations once it goes in and then that's gonna be tracking those build out our facts all the way through the repositories

781
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:40,640
To the final image so that we can basically track the entire distribution and we can say anywhere, you know

782
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,560
These are the problems

783
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:45,920
These are the things that we have to target so that we can actually say to people using solace, you know

784
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,880
Well, here's a bit of peace of mind, you know

785
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,320
so that's one of the things I personally want to be focusing on but

786
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,360
Yeah

787
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,800
But 11 at some stage, that's what everybody that's what's on everyone's mind

788
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,680
But it sounds like there's a lot of good core stuff getting worked on right now

789
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,920
I mean, that's why I did budget 10.4

790
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,960
But not I there was actually a load of us and a lot of it was a Stefan helping me there

791
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:11,640
Like the new workspaces stuff the new animations window. That was all Stefan

792
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,360
10.4 was kind of

793
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:20,440
At LTS I would say because there was a lot of problems in the existing 10.3 release

794
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,920
Like if you had a bottom panel and you click the budget menu

795
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,640
Sometimes it would appear down the bottom

796
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,160
Sometimes it would start at the top

797
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:34,560
So every row that put new budget popovers in so the idea was to give me more time

798
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:38,740
So that we didn't have to worry about budget lever a little bit longer, you know

799
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:43,520
So the people have a stable desktop to use day to day. Yeah, and I'll put you lovingly start that bit later

800
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:47,400
Yeah, I think that probably played I think I that's kind of what I was like thinking to myself

801
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,160
It's like this is this is getting sort of refined now

802
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,000
I could probably throw this on a production machine and be comfortable for a while. So that's what I did

803
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,360
I would yeah, I mean, it's kind of our goal, you know get to the point where we can say, you know

804
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:04,280
This is a world-class OS that we're shipping and that's why I'm again too. So it's a bit of a journey

805
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:08,600
Lots of things are coming into place with the Software Center improvements

806
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:14,400
And I mean some of the most important things we're doing right now is collaborating with other projects and working outside of solace

807
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,280
And I think that's very very important to us and the rest of the Linux community. Yeah

808
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:23,360
And it sounds like it's all been going pretty good and been kicking some ass. Mr. Wimpy speaking of some of that cross collab

809
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:28,520
Speaking across collab. You're gonna be at odd camp this coming weekend, correct? I

810
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:34,200
Am yes, and you are doing a bit of a mashup show down there, aren't you?

811
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,760
We are yeah

812
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,800
I think

813
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:38,960
so

814
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:47,560
We're gonna do a live show on I think the Saturday evening and Joe Ressington is organizing that so it's a mashup of

815
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,860
Some of the late-night Linux podcasters and some of the Ubuntu podcasters

816
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:59,320
We we're gonna do a live podcast with a Q&A section

817
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:05,840
In fact, I'll have a link in the show notes. Joe's just put a call out for questions for odd camp

818
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:09,680
they have a Google form that you can fill out with your question or

819
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,800
You can go to their late night linux.com slash contact page and probably email it in

820
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:15,480
or

821
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,480
URL is late night linux.com

822
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:23,520
Forward slash ask. Oh, yeah or hashtag ask. Oh, that's a good. I like that

823
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:28,720
Yes, we have we're using hashtag ask error right now for for user error

824
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:32,420
Ask August that's good. We should have asked lup

825
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:35,340
All right. So yeah, there you go

826
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:41,100
So there with that you can find links in the show notes to that stuff. Also check out wimpy on the Ubuntu podcast

827
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:46,780
I'm gonna be looking forward to that episode. Are you guys gonna put a bout out in both of your feeds? How does that work?

828
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:54,180
In the past we have done I think we don't do these sort of cross distro cross podcasting

829
01:03:55,620 --> 01:04:01,380
But yeah, I did one with the guys at ubu con last year and we put that out on the Ubuntu podcast feed

830
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:03,500
So probably yes

831
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:10,980
So long as we don't make her Horlicks off it and it goes well then yeah, we'll publish it. Yeah, I hope it's fun

832
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:15,220
I hope it's fun. Well guys great work. Thank you very much for chatting with us about that

833
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:20,860
I have just a little slack wear follow-up to do and the best bug I've ever seen submitted

834
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:25,580
Simon sent it into the show and we got to talk about it really quickly. I want to thank ting though

835
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:28,640
Just full stop right here. This is one of these sponsors

836
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:33,500
I've been using now for years and it's made a real difference. It's it's so simple

837
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:39,180
I really don't have time to deal with complicated wireless stuff or really pay out the nose for stuff

838
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:45,500
I don't use and that's why I like ting it's six dollars a month for your wireless and then whatever you use you just pay for

839
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,940
So a few minutes and your messages and your megabytes, that's just what I don't use minutes

840
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:53,980
Really? In fact, there's been months where I've not used a minute not a minute now there are months

841
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:58,860
There are months where I use minutes and I may use many of those minutes

842
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:03,900
But I got to tell you it really averages out. I'm saving about two thousand dollars a year every two years

843
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:08,940
So about a thousand dollars a year Wow, you know average ting bills about twenty three dollars per phone

844
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:13,980
but what's what's the reason why it's such a huge savings for me is I had two lines and

845
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:18,420
I was paying I was paying probably after-tax a hundred and forty dollars a month for two phones

846
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:25,100
Um now we have three phones and I'm usually paying around thirty seven forty bucks a month

847
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:27,820
That's crazy. Yeah, it's crazy

848
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:30,740
Linux dot ting comm I love it

849
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:36,900
You pay for what you use nationwide coverage GSM and CDMA and a dashboard that guess what goes for days

850
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:42,620
They also have apps for your device and fantastic customer support Linux dot ting comm

851
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:46,940
You got to go there to support the show and you get twenty five dollars in service credit

852
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:51,420
If you bring a GSM or a CDMA they got yep

853
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:55,020
They got a BYOD page check or if you just want to buy a new one from them

854
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:57,760
They'll give it twenty five dollars off the phone Linux dot ting comm

855
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:05,840
Damn, you know you're excited if you use the service you're excited if you don't use the service Linux dot ting comm so slack wear thoughts

856
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:11,060
You know I I didn't really expect to use it much after the show West to be honest with you

857
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:16,180
But me you know I sat down and it was on the machine that I was gonna load with gen 2 and I thought well

858
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:20,420
You know I never really got all the way like I never felt like I didn't you know

859
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:24,900
I was I just I didn't have I didn't get to that point where I'm just using it to screw around

860
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:26,900
I was always in that mode

861
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:32,420
For like reviewing it for the show yeah, yeah, and you know I thought about it a little bit

862
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:34,420
I thought to myself if

863
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:40,060
If you go into slack wear, and you don't you know you're not expecting it to be a boon to you know

864
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:44,460
You're not expecting it to to be soulless you go in you go in with that kind of mindset

865
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:50,540
It was a lot of fun to get my nostalgia on but after after I got over the nostalgia aspect of it

866
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,540
Which is kind of what I talked about the most last week

867
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,500
I

868
01:06:54,500 --> 01:07:02,780
realized that it reminded me of a of a different time where Linux was simpler in and a lot easier to just

869
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,620
straight up

870
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:09,780
Understand just like I can see it how it's all laid out right here. It makes a lot of sense to me and

871
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:14,580
There's something else about it. It's it's it's not that it's like raw Linux. It's

872
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:20,260
For better or for worse like if you're comfortable with the versions of software that slack where has available

873
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:23,940
And there's like slack scripts and stuff to get newer stuff like you know newer versions of Firefox

874
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:25,700
but like say you wanted like Apache and

875
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:32,700
You know a mail program like post fix and maybe a database, and it just didn't need to be super super current stuff

876
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,900
It's just something you wanted in your house to like serve your favorite links up

877
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:39,780
And you wanted a mysql database for the back end for your photo management program or whatever

878
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:43,820
Slack where is kind of perfect because

879
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:49,500
It's it's an era of Linux where you could install it

880
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:53,740
It's like it's so much like arch except for without nothing like ours

881
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,420
I

882
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,740
Struggled to relate that because you can install it

883
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,020
And then you can literally not come back to it for two years

884
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:05,140
And if in two years after not even touching this box you log in and all of a sudden you want to install a new

885
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:07,020
Package it's fine

886
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:08,580
It's it's totally fine

887
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:12,660
It's not a big deal if you wanted if you even and you maybe maybe

888
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:18,780
Maybe been some updates to slack where like maybe a point release maybe an update to slack where but probably not

889
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:22,220
Like it's it's the it's like it's a kind of computing

890
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:29,300
We no longer have access to because all of our devices either constantly are getting abandoned by the vendor or need to be updated

891
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,700
It's either or

892
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:35,900
My Chromecast I use it so rarely that I swear every damn time I turn it on I have to wait ten minutes while

893
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:42,100
It updates every single time you know my set-top box on my TV updates every single month it is

894
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:44,620
It's just this

895
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:45,980
non-stop

896
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:52,700
Let us improve that experience for you and often the experience is not improved and there really is something to be said

897
01:08:52,700 --> 01:09:00,700
For this time and I remember it in Linux where there was just so much time between releases software moved

898
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,620
slower

899
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:08,580
it just moved slower and and you could install a Debian box and let it just sit in a closet and

900
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:11,380
Nothing had really changed on it

901
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:18,140
And that's what slackware represents that time that we have lost access to in almost all aspects of our life

902
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:24,100
And and I wouldn't necessarily want to live there right, but I could see like if I just had a utility box sitting in the corner

903
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:28,540
Hosting up some websites for my LAN, and I didn't need to be a big deal

904
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:34,060
It's and you didn't want to make it a big old project or like you know like you set it up once you got involved

905
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:37,300
With it you understood how everything worked, and yeah, you come back to it

906
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:43,500
There wasn't a whole lot of extra stuff that will suddenly show up or change or there's a real sense of ownership there

907
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,980
Yeah, exactly so I could I could totally see the long-term

908
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:49,100
But you get the fun of like an arch system where you're piecing it together yourself

909
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,140
But you don't have to that's what it is constantly

910
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:54,580
Yeah, read a blog to make sure that you're not gonna break your system. That is what it is

911
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:59,260
So here's this was sent into the show by Simon, and this is my favorite

912
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:03,980
this is my favorite bug of the week it was submitted to Dimitri by Dimitri and

913
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:11,340
It's over on the Ubuntu mailing list as a bug and he has a question. He says the subject is y2k 100 bug is

914
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:17,300
Is it reasonable to expect the below that the Ubuntu version numbers below will be accurate in?

915
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,340
in April

916
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:23,900
2100 it's going to be Ubuntu 100 dot 04 LTS

917
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,300
but in

918
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:28,300
April of the year 3000

919
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:35,660
It's going to be 1000 dot 04 dot LTS which obviously wouldn't make any sense since it's the year 3000 so you have you know

920
01:10:35,660 --> 01:10:37,860
Obviously there's a there's a numbering problem here

921
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:43,540
a very important problem that Dimitri brings up and so the Ubuntu development team took a

922
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:49,020
Long hard look at this bug and they came back with what I think is a pretty solid answer

923
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:51,540
And I'm imagining they're gonna just go ahead and consider this one resolved

924
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:59,120
The answer from the Ubuntu team is the world will have been obliterated by nuclear war and biochemical warfare by then

925
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:01,140
So no need to worry about it

926
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:06,460
I feel way more assured. You know you sometimes. There's this little things you don't have to worry about

927
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:10,140
Does make you wonder how they know about that ahead of time?

928
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:15,620
I wonder if it's like the Apple stuff where they don't you know at Apple

929
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:20,740
They have like you can't use iTunes we at a nuke base like I wonder if I went to has that in the terms of

930
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:22,740
Service maybe they don't install

931
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:28,820
Anyways, thank you everybody for coming in the moment, but specifically

932
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:32,740
Thank you to wimpy and I key for being there. Thank you to our regulars for making it this week

933
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:37,820
Even though there wasn't a lot of time for everybody. I see you I appreciate you guys making it the mumble room, too

934
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:40,300
I hope you can join us next week. I may or may not be here

935
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:45,780
Depending on how crazy that Eclipse is that could be it could be the at the lost episode for me

936
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:49,660
We'll see but if I do make it why don't you join us?

937
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:52,740
We'll do it live over JB live TV at 2 p.m.. Pacific

938
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:59,860
You can get that converted from JB time to your time at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar Linux unplug dot reddit comm is the sub

939
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:05,620
Reddit Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contacts the way to get us and the network's at Jupiter signal at Jupiter signal. That's where you find it

940
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:22,900
Thanks for joining us

941
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:37,620
You

942
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:46,900
Okay, let's unleash the hounds JB titles comm let's pick our title before we go

943
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:52,660
Did you want to toss anything else development wise going on? We're thinking about having reoccurring development meetings

944
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:58,260
We should maybe mention that so and discord dot is a discord emmy slash Jupiter colony

945
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:01,940
Yeah, that'll be getting set up over there for more developer participation

946
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:04,840
But was there anything else we want to mention development wise, right?

947
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:06,840
So so what is it Beardsley?

948
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:09,420
We have a

949
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:12,180
Jupiter dev channel on the discord now

950
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:20,220
And I was talking with one of the developers that's helped out in JB in the past and he's he's kind of thinking about

951
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,700
leading a

952
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:26,440
We haven't decided how often maybe weekly maybe monthly

953
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:33,500
Like a development meetup for the JB community really to work on on JB projects in in discord

954
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:39,840
uh, yeah, so probably some mix of voice chat and text chat sweet and

955
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:45,400
It was partially spurred on by the fact that we're kind of

956
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,700
Toying with the idea of maybe completely rewriting

957
01:13:52,400 --> 01:14:00,200
Of course every open source project eventually gets to this point. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of inherited crap and

958
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,200
And

959
01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:08,140
We kind of need to just dump all of that to be able to expand what we want JB to do

960
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:16,400
So you're saying it's gonna be rebuilt better than ever yeah, you have the technology I heard we're gonna rebuild it better faster and stronger

961
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,280
What are you gonna build it with?

962
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,440
Probably still gonna be Ruby

963
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:27,800
If you would have said rust, I think you would have had a lot of people excited. Maybe we'll go crazy

964
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:32,480
Maybe we'll do elixir. I was gonna say yeah elixir. I think you should I hear great things

965
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,600
Yeah, there you go. Yeah, I noticed that a new bug was opened

966
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,920
I think it was new bug was open up on the soundboard. We're getting it

967
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:42,080
We're trying to get a few more things fixed on the soundboard. I want to get

968
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,960
basically

969
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:49,280
State saving per action for the sound. Oh, yes. Yes. Yes that way if it crashes

970
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:54,520
You don't lose all your or the machine. Yeah, or the machines were running on crashes. Yeah in the case

971
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:59,220
I love you guys. Thank you guys speaking of the the soundboard

972
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:07,880
Since you have snap on solace now, you can install the soundboard. Oh, yeah, that's right. I might is your soundboard not portable

973
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:22,440
It is an a you are
