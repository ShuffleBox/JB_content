WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.040
Add this to the list of reasons to never run Windows.

00:04.040 --> 00:07.200
Office Depot's name's getting dragged through the dirt

00:07.200 --> 00:11.040
this week when it was revealed that they will be paying out

00:11.040 --> 00:15.000
$35 million in refunds for tricking people

00:15.000 --> 00:16.760
with bogus malware scans.

00:16.760 --> 00:17.600
Yeah, I don't know.

00:17.600 --> 00:21.120
This is just, it's been so long since I've bought computers

00:21.120 --> 00:23.000
this way, it felt so foreign.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
But you gotta feel bad for people who just want to get

00:26.000 --> 00:28.180
a new machine and end up as part of this scam.

00:28.180 --> 00:29.360
Windows users would come in.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.760
They'd say, take a look at my computer, it's running slow.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.120
That's because it runs Windows.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.360
I mean, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.840
I know a lot of people, I'm just having fun.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.120
And so then they would bring it in and Office Depot

00:40.120 --> 00:43.560
would scan it and they had the software rigged

00:43.560 --> 00:47.440
to show false detections, false threats.

00:47.440 --> 00:50.300
And then they'd be like, all right, $300 to fix that.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.100
I mean, how could you not, right?

00:52.100 --> 00:54.380
You don't know, you're bringing your stuff to Office Depot

00:54.380 --> 00:56.440
so you obviously have no idea how computers work.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.360
I know, it's such a shame though because like,

00:58.360 --> 01:01.400
you could grab a great SSD for that price

01:01.400 --> 01:03.520
and that would make the machine way faster

01:03.520 --> 01:05.560
without a doubt, right?

01:05.560 --> 01:06.400
Of course.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.840
Also, maybe put Linux on there.

01:08.840 --> 01:13.840
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 295 for April 2nd, 2019.

01:13.840 --> 01:28.480
Oh, hey y'all, welcome in to your weekly Linux talk show,

01:28.480 --> 01:29.440
Linux Unplugged.

01:29.440 --> 01:32.400
This week, it's a special episode.

01:32.400 --> 01:33.840
We are packed.

01:33.840 --> 01:34.800
My name is Chris.

01:34.800 --> 01:35.720
My name is Wes.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.080
Hello, Mr. Payne.

01:37.080 --> 01:40.680
So aside from a full cast of characters this week,

01:40.680 --> 01:42.920
we have a big batch of community news

01:42.920 --> 01:44.280
that we'll be getting into.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.600
Mozilla is doing quite a few useful things.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.280
We'll tell you about them this week.

01:48.280 --> 01:52.240
NGINX wants to reassure you, everything's gonna be okay.

01:52.240 --> 01:56.040
And Raspberry Pi has new accessories for you to buy

01:56.040 --> 01:58.520
and they got me with one of them.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.560
I'll tell you which new Raspberry Pi accessory

02:00.560 --> 02:02.300
I picked up this week.

02:02.300 --> 02:06.480
And we'll get into some big news for elementary OS

02:06.480 --> 02:10.480
and the slick update the Ubuntu Mate project has

02:10.480 --> 02:12.280
for Raspberry Pi users.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.280
There's something really sweet in there.

02:14.280 --> 02:16.200
I don't know, for me, it's like a game changer.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.720
We'll talk about that in a little bit.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.360
And then towards the end of the show,

02:19.360 --> 02:21.020
assuming we have some time,

02:21.020 --> 02:24.280
we have some deep, deep thought provoking feedback

02:24.280 --> 02:25.320
to get into.

02:25.320 --> 02:26.640
Well, at least some decent feedback.

02:26.640 --> 02:29.560
I don't know if I'd say it's deep and thought provoking.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.680
Stick around and find out.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.240
Yeah, maybe that's the way to put it.

02:33.240 --> 02:36.040
But as we're getting close to episode 300,

02:36.040 --> 02:39.280
I feel like we've got some great stuff lined up,

02:39.280 --> 02:41.360
including, like I mentioned earlier,

02:41.360 --> 02:43.360
a great cast of characters.

02:43.360 --> 02:44.840
In our Mumble Room joining us this week,

02:44.840 --> 02:46.160
we've got Billy, Brandon, Brent,

02:46.160 --> 02:49.320
Cassidy from elementary, Cubicle Mate, Foursquare,

02:49.320 --> 02:53.480
Fundament Utils, Mini-Mech, NE1, Nero Burner,

02:53.480 --> 02:57.400
Skull Leader, Social Happiness, awesome to see you, Emma,

02:57.400 --> 02:59.360
Tech Mav, oh man, great to see you,

02:59.360 --> 03:00.720
and of course, Mr. Wimpress.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.920
Time appropriate, greetings, Mumble Room.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.040
Hello, everybody.

03:04.040 --> 03:06.200
Good evening, how's it going?

03:06.200 --> 03:07.640
Wow.

03:07.640 --> 03:08.920
I'm just looking at the waveform there.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.000
This is incredible.

03:10.000 --> 03:10.840
That was great.

03:10.840 --> 03:11.680
Hello, everybody.

03:11.680 --> 03:14.800
It is really good to have you here today.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.280
Our main duty for this episode this week

03:17.280 --> 03:19.760
was to avoid putting April Fool's stories

03:19.760 --> 03:21.200
in the news lineup.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.480
That was job one.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.560
And this is Tuesday.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.160
April Fool's was yesterday.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.520
We were really close, really close.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.600
So I had to look and had to reject a lot of stories.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.000
We all, we've got a team now.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.840
We've got a team now, including folks

03:37.840 --> 03:40.200
that are just dedicated to researching this stuff.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.040
It's a team, it's pretty great.

03:42.040 --> 03:45.560
And there was one story that, it's fake,

03:45.560 --> 03:48.400
but it really made me chuckle.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.240
Did you see this one?

03:49.240 --> 03:50.080
I did.

03:50.080 --> 03:50.920
You did see this one?

03:50.920 --> 03:53.120
Hackaday had their April Fool's story.

03:53.120 --> 03:58.120
GNU slash Linux distros drop support for Vi.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.200
It's about time.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.760
No more VI, the war is over.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.200
They say the reasons for this move

04:04.200 --> 04:05.840
aren't entirely clear to us,

04:05.840 --> 04:09.680
but from what we can see on the GNU slash Linux mailing list,

04:09.680 --> 04:11.400
the confusing modal interface

04:11.400 --> 04:14.480
and the fact that it's been hard for novice users

04:14.480 --> 04:16.600
was the only cause of the decision.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.160
Well, you can speak to this, Chris.

04:18.160 --> 04:21.760
I thought you would say that.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.120
Actually, before I realized it was,

04:23.120 --> 04:25.240
because I mean, I was reading a bunch of fake stuff

04:25.240 --> 04:26.160
and real stuff, right?

04:26.160 --> 04:27.320
There was still real news that day.

04:27.320 --> 04:28.720
Yeah, which we'll get to.

04:28.720 --> 04:29.840
I thought this might've just been

04:29.840 --> 04:32.760
like deprecating VI compatibility mode or something.

04:32.760 --> 04:34.320
I thought this was a real change.

04:34.320 --> 04:35.360
So they definitely got me.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.640
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.720
Yeah, and of course, the only thing

04:39.720 --> 04:40.560
that would've made the story better

04:40.560 --> 04:42.760
is if everything was switching over to Nano by default.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.520
We were here earlier in the studio

04:44.520 --> 04:46.160
working on a configuration file

04:46.160 --> 04:49.360
and Wes was standing next to me and I had to make a point

04:49.360 --> 04:51.600
of not only do I, when Wes is next to me,

04:51.600 --> 04:54.400
not only do I edit Nano, but I use Nano dash W

04:54.400 --> 04:55.920
because you gotta have the wide Nano.

04:55.920 --> 04:56.840
You gotta go all in.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.000
So that's what I did.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
You're a Nano expert.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.840
All right, well, let's get into the real news this week.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.280
There is actually some news.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.680
Not all of it is fake.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.920
So kicking off, we have an announcement for the Apache

05:07.920 --> 05:09.080
Foundation.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.240
They have hit their 20th anniversary.

05:11.240 --> 05:13.520
So another big happy birthday this week

05:13.520 --> 05:16.400
goes out to what they bill as the world's largest

05:16.400 --> 05:20.080
open source foundation, which provides 20 billion worth

05:20.080 --> 05:23.760
of software for public good at 100%, no cost by now.

05:25.960 --> 05:27.160
Happy birthday, I guess.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.040
Yeah, I mean, we should take some time and appreciate.

05:30.040 --> 05:33.040
There's a lot of really good software under that

05:33.040 --> 05:36.120
and supported by that foundation.

05:36.120 --> 05:39.760
So big thank you to the Apache Foundation and happy birthday.

05:39.760 --> 05:43.120
They were founded in 1999, which makes

05:43.120 --> 05:46.440
me feel like an old man and makes me realize

05:46.440 --> 05:49.440
that that was 20 years ago, which we will just

05:49.440 --> 05:51.400
move right on from that and continue in.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.920
Here's to many more of those years for both of you.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.000
I hope I'm still here.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
I hope I am here talking about their 40th.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.520
Wouldn't that be amazing?

06:00.520 --> 06:01.240
I'll see you there.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.400
And then let's play this clip.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.040
Perfect.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.840
All right, hello future Chris.

06:04.840 --> 06:10.560
Now, let's move on to the Mozilla is useful category.

06:10.560 --> 06:11.840
And I like this.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.600
I like looking at the stuff Mozilla

06:13.600 --> 06:18.480
is doing that is either advancing the web in a good way

06:18.480 --> 06:20.520
or is maybe even a project outside of Firefox

06:20.520 --> 06:22.200
and Thunderbird.

06:22.200 --> 06:25.200
Not really context, we talk a lot about Mozilla.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.360
So first for Firefox users, this is a fascinating one

06:28.360 --> 06:30.080
that I think we're all going to agree

06:30.080 --> 06:33.240
is a very, very good feature they need to just adopt.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.840
Don't even experiment, just go with it immediately.

06:35.840 --> 06:39.600
And that is reducing notifications for permissions

06:39.600 --> 06:42.320
to have notifications on your computer.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.400
Websites, how do I put this because I'm butchering this.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.760
Everyone wants to send you push notifications.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.920
And they want to notify you about their intent

06:49.920 --> 06:51.280
to send you those notifications.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.720
They say, in the interest of protecting our users

06:53.720 --> 06:55.480
and the web platform as a whole, we

06:55.480 --> 06:57.120
plan to experiment with restricting

06:57.120 --> 07:01.800
how and when websites can ask for notification permissions.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.760
You can see a little bit of their motivation

07:03.760 --> 07:07.080
as they write anecdotal evidence, AKA people

07:07.080 --> 07:08.800
complaining, tells us that there is

07:08.800 --> 07:10.920
an issue with notification permission prompts

07:10.920 --> 07:12.240
among our user base.

07:12.240 --> 07:13.920
As we browse the web, we regularly

07:13.920 --> 07:15.120
encounter these prompts.

07:15.120 --> 07:17.480
And more often than not, we become annoyed at them.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.800
Or, and this was true, I remember distinctly

07:19.800 --> 07:21.760
for some reason the first time I saw one of these

07:21.760 --> 07:23.800
because they accidentally clicked allow.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.160
And then suddenly I was getting notifications

07:26.160 --> 07:29.040
showing up on my browser and everywhere that I was signed in.

07:29.040 --> 07:29.960
They're just confusing.

07:29.960 --> 07:32.540
And I don't think, especially people already familiar

07:32.540 --> 07:33.880
with the way the web works, they're

07:33.880 --> 07:36.600
sort of this weird, new, out of band system.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.200
And you never know what they really want to use it for.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.360
So you're asked to make a decision before you even

07:41.360 --> 07:42.960
understand what the content is that you're

07:42.960 --> 07:44.120
going to get delivered.

07:44.120 --> 07:49.040
And then you combine it with the cookie notice policy

07:49.040 --> 07:53.200
and the user data notice policy or the hey,

07:53.200 --> 07:55.760
would you like to sign up for our mailing list policy

07:55.760 --> 07:58.640
thing that comes up or the hey, don't use an ad blocker.

07:58.640 --> 08:02.280
All these things that come up at once now when I load a website

08:02.280 --> 08:04.880
are horrible.

08:04.880 --> 08:08.080
Nothing like when I use the web when it was originally started.

08:08.080 --> 08:08.840
These are awful.

08:08.840 --> 08:10.800
But it's more interactive, Chris.

08:10.800 --> 08:11.320
Yeah.

08:11.320 --> 08:13.760
I've got to have me and my notifications.

08:13.760 --> 08:14.760
That's for sure.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.480
They do have some interesting data here.

08:16.480 --> 08:19.520
So it's not all just anecdotes from people

08:19.520 --> 08:23.600
running the Firefox beta from December 21 from 2018

08:23.600 --> 08:26.760
to January 24, so about a month of data.

08:26.760 --> 08:29.600
There was 18 million prompts shown.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.480
And these are just people on the beta.

08:31.480 --> 08:34.280
And not even 3% were accepted.

08:34.280 --> 08:37.480
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

08:37.480 --> 08:38.920
Not even 3%?

08:38.920 --> 08:39.640
Ouch.

08:39.640 --> 08:40.760
Not even 3%?

08:40.760 --> 08:42.600
I know, right?

08:42.600 --> 08:44.360
That's devastating.

08:44.360 --> 08:48.920
18 million prompts and not even 3% of them were accepted.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.520
It's devastating.

08:50.520 --> 08:52.640
That doesn't work.

08:52.640 --> 08:53.160
Wow.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.840
Well, I mean, there's always architects

08:54.840 --> 08:56.120
in the chat room suggestion.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.880
Break it all, just turn off JavaScript.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.160
And that's one way.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.120
Yeah, there you go.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.920
That'll solve the problem.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.460
Just actually, you know what else you could do?

09:03.460 --> 09:04.840
You could switch everything to AMP.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.120
That'll solve the problem too.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.880
Problem solved with AMP, everybody.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.920
Now, here's something else that Mozilla's doing

09:10.920 --> 09:15.240
that maybe one day could surplant,

09:15.240 --> 09:16.640
although it's probably not likely,

09:16.640 --> 09:19.280
but could become at least a competitive alternative

09:19.280 --> 09:22.400
to Electron if I'm not misreading this.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.880
And Mozilla's bringing up the point

09:23.880 --> 09:26.320
that with WebAssembly now becoming a thing

09:26.320 --> 09:28.240
and all major browsers supporting it,

09:28.240 --> 09:30.800
more and more folks are trying to develop applications

09:30.800 --> 09:32.560
beyond the browser.

09:32.560 --> 09:35.160
They say doing that provides a fast, scalable, and secure way

09:35.160 --> 09:39.600
to run the same code across all your machines.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.640
But we have yet to have a solid foundation

09:41.640 --> 09:42.840
in which to build upon.

09:42.840 --> 09:44.680
Code outside of a browser needs a way

09:44.680 --> 09:47.280
to talk to the system, a system interface.

09:47.280 --> 09:50.160
And the WebAssembly platform doesn't have that yet.

09:50.160 --> 09:53.920
Now, Mozilla has been working on a runtime for the desktop

09:53.920 --> 09:57.520
that allows you to run WebAssembly applications

09:57.520 --> 09:59.720
as a desktop application.

09:59.720 --> 10:02.080
But you needed, I guess, a standard to pull this off.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.920
And that seems to be what they're coming out

10:03.920 --> 10:06.040
with is this WASI standard.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.000
Am I getting that right, Wes, W-A-S-I?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
There you go, W-A-S-I.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.040
Not wasabi, but WASI.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.280
That might taste better.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.760
Yeah, that might.

10:14.760 --> 10:16.600
What are they trying to accomplish here?

10:16.600 --> 10:19.400
They're exploiting the fact that we've made WebAssembly,

10:19.400 --> 10:21.880
and it doesn't run on real hardware, right?

10:21.880 --> 10:24.200
We just described this abstract machine

10:24.200 --> 10:26.400
that we had already worked out how to run

10:26.400 --> 10:29.960
and are actively working out how to run fast in our browsers.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.840
So this is just all the little extra details

10:31.840 --> 10:34.280
you need when you want to think, OK, well,

10:34.280 --> 10:36.880
this could probably run a lot of other places, too.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.400
Yeah, much like we do with Electron,

10:39.400 --> 10:41.400
only using the Chrome runtime, essentially.

10:41.400 --> 10:44.840
Or it's the reverse of Java applets and Java and network.

10:44.840 --> 10:45.360
Yeah.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.880
Yeah, it's nice to see Mozilla doing these kinds of things.

10:47.880 --> 10:50.000
Yeah, let's figure out a way to do this.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.800
They have been actively involved in all kinds

10:51.800 --> 10:53.000
of great WebAssembly stuff.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.720
And actually, they've got some of the best documentation.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.080
If you're getting started with WebAssembly,

10:56.080 --> 10:57.720
you want to learn about some of the concepts.

10:57.720 --> 10:58.240
Yeah.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.560
We did also recently see Lucet, which

11:00.560 --> 11:03.760
is the Fastly Corporation's WebAssembly runtime.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.800
And there's a couple other open source projects.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.640
So there's clearly a lot of stuff going on.

11:07.640 --> 11:10.400
It's nice to have a standard now early in the process

11:10.400 --> 11:12.800
so we don't end up with a whole bunch of divergent runtimes.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.240
WebAssembly is coming.

11:14.240 --> 11:17.160
And it's going to come to your desktop, too.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.640
And maybe that'd be good.

11:18.640 --> 11:22.080
Maybe it'll make a good competitor to Electron

11:22.080 --> 11:25.800
and keep both of them very, I guess,

11:25.800 --> 11:27.640
actively engaged in pushing the boundaries.

11:27.640 --> 11:28.880
I mean, yeah, one thing's for sure.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.680
It's rare that we see things fade away.

11:30.680 --> 11:32.560
We just have more things on our systems.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.040
Yeah.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.480
Yeah, things don't really go away anymore.

11:34.480 --> 11:35.480
No.

11:35.480 --> 11:36.480
Yeah.

11:36.480 --> 11:38.520
They're too big to fail after a certain point.

11:38.520 --> 11:41.640
Now, there's one last thing that Mozilla along with,

11:41.640 --> 11:43.960
I think, the folks behind Vorbis are working on.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.280
It's a Mozilla employee who was involved

11:46.280 --> 11:49.960
with the Speaks codec and also Opus.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.480
So this guy really knows his stuff.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.560
Those are some credentials.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.360
And they're working on LPCnet.

11:55.360 --> 11:58.920
This is a codec in which they can transmit audio

11:58.920 --> 12:03.920
in as little as 1.6 kilobytes.

12:03.920 --> 12:04.840
Wow.

12:04.840 --> 12:08.720
They're doing this with essentially a synthesis.

12:08.720 --> 12:13.880
So instead of actually capturing the entire audio waveform,

12:13.880 --> 12:15.400
it's almost like taking audio.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.280
This is a super rough layman translation.

12:18.280 --> 12:23.640
But it's almost like taking it and making it an SVG.

12:23.640 --> 12:25.520
Yeah, you're trying to capture just enough detail

12:25.520 --> 12:27.920
to recreate it, not perfectly, but be

12:27.920 --> 12:31.280
able to describe it in a way that's good enough.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.120
We have Mr. Bacon here, Mr. Cheese Bacon,

12:33.120 --> 12:34.000
now part of our team.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.880
Cheese, I'm going to butcher this.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.160
So I want you to kind of help explain this to me.

12:40.160 --> 12:44.640
But an SVG, it's a vector graphic which is scalable.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.960
And so it's like the math for the image.

12:47.960 --> 12:49.840
And then it renders the final image.

12:49.840 --> 12:52.400
And you can rescale it to any size you want.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.120
You can transmit a tiny SVG, but you

12:54.120 --> 12:56.400
could have a huge image that you produce from it, correct?

12:56.400 --> 12:56.880
Correct.

12:56.880 --> 12:59.720
So I mean, it's a vector image.

12:59.720 --> 13:03.600
And it stands for scalable vector graphic.

13:03.600 --> 13:08.280
And it'll allow you to support transparencies with it.

13:08.280 --> 13:12.560
Once you've created the SVG, you can open it up in a text editor

13:12.560 --> 13:14.280
and edit it.

13:14.280 --> 13:19.480
You can actually add like early animation type work to it.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.760
SVGs are really cool.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.680
And you can reduce their size.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.640
And since they're vector graphics, of course,

13:25.640 --> 13:27.000
they can be scaled infinitely.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.080
So if you needed to use that same SVG on a billboard

13:32.080 --> 13:34.320
or the side of an 18-wheeler or wherever

13:34.320 --> 13:35.520
you needed to use that image, you

13:35.520 --> 13:38.400
could scale it without losing resolution

13:38.400 --> 13:42.400
or having an issue where it looked

13:42.400 --> 13:45.800
aliased or something pixelated or something like that.

13:45.800 --> 13:46.560
Exactly.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.720
Now, I admit my analogy is weak here.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.880
But now imagine taking that same concept

13:50.880 --> 13:54.760
and applying it to audio, where you take the data

13:54.760 --> 13:56.080
and you vectorize it.

13:56.080 --> 13:59.880
And then you can re-synthesize it later on.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.720
And you can improve the recreation process

14:03.720 --> 14:04.320
down the road.

14:04.320 --> 14:07.160
You can have better and better models and better and better

14:07.160 --> 14:08.480
ways to do speech.

14:08.480 --> 14:09.600
They're getting there now.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.100
They're getting there to the sense

14:11.100 --> 14:13.240
that you almost can recreate speech using,

14:13.240 --> 14:15.160
guess what, machine learning, to have something

14:15.160 --> 14:16.200
that sounds very accurate.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.880
So I'm going to play you a demo here.

14:17.880 --> 14:22.280
Here is the old technology using a great codec.

14:22.280 --> 14:23.820
So it's still really good compression.

14:23.820 --> 14:25.520
But it's old synthesis.

14:25.520 --> 14:29.680
The birch canoe slid on the smooth plex,

14:29.680 --> 14:32.480
glue the sheet to the dark blue background.

14:32.480 --> 14:36.920
Now, it sounds like a speak and spell a little bit.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.520
But the one thing you have to give it

14:38.520 --> 14:41.080
is it's like two kilobits of audio a second.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.840
It sounds like a really bad phone call.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.800
But it is kind of understandable.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.040
And you could use that to get speech

14:48.040 --> 14:50.920
in the worst case connections, which is really impressive.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.760
Because that brings in all kinds of packet radio possibly.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.800
I don't know, all kinds of solutions.

14:55.800 --> 14:59.480
Here is what this LPCNet project that's

14:59.480 --> 15:03.480
getting contributed by Mozilla employee that

15:03.480 --> 15:06.480
is bringing this further using the machine learning I just

15:06.480 --> 15:07.080
talked about.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.160
This is their more current sample now.

15:09.160 --> 15:13.160
Add the sum to the product of these three.

15:13.160 --> 15:16.080
Thieves who rob friends deserve jail.

15:16.080 --> 15:21.640
Now, I don't know what that is about.

15:21.640 --> 15:25.920
But that's just 1.6 kilobits of data.

15:25.920 --> 15:27.920
Wow, that's pretty tiny.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.880
And it sounds really, I mean, it's not bad.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.200
It's totally understandable.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.720
Like, I'm going to play just a second.

15:33.720 --> 15:36.360
Add the sum to the product of these three.

15:36.360 --> 15:37.880
That is much better than.

15:37.880 --> 15:40.760
The birch canoe slid on the smooth plex.

15:40.760 --> 15:42.800
Right, that's a much better.

15:42.800 --> 15:48.080
And you could see where later on the decoder and the thing

15:48.080 --> 15:51.120
that reconstitutes the speech could get much, much better

15:51.120 --> 15:53.280
to the point where it could sound like a podcaster.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.720
Oh, yes.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.920
Honestly, those are pretty good.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.560
Right now, and it's kind of interesting,

15:57.560 --> 15:59.360
they've done a great job of explaining it.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.360
All the stuff that most people are familiar with

16:01.360 --> 16:03.400
are called waveform coders.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.800
And then this is a vocoder.

16:04.800 --> 16:05.320
Yeah.

16:05.320 --> 16:07.360
And waveform coders are stuff like Opus

16:07.360 --> 16:08.960
and all the stuff you might use for music.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.000
Everything we're familiar, right?

16:10.000 --> 16:12.720
And they basically try to take the natural waveform that

16:12.720 --> 16:15.680
is sound and transcribe that as closely as possible

16:15.680 --> 16:17.240
and capture all of that detail.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.680
Now, maybe with MP3, you start throwing some of that away.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.440
But essentially, you're recreating the waveform, right?

16:22.440 --> 16:24.400
Vocoders, on the other hand, as you said,

16:24.400 --> 16:26.200
they're really synthesizers.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.960
They try to, like, in this mode, you have the encoder.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.760
And it tries to grab a bunch of high-level stuff,

16:31.760 --> 16:34.280
like pitch, shape of the vocal tract.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.400
You have this model that you fill parameters for.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.560
So instead of trying to actually track the waveform,

16:39.560 --> 16:41.000
it's more like describing, you could

16:41.000 --> 16:42.720
think of a really high-level version

16:42.720 --> 16:44.760
would be a transcript and then feeding a transcript back.

16:44.760 --> 16:45.160
Yeah.

16:45.160 --> 16:45.360
Right?

16:45.360 --> 16:47.560
But this is a little lower level because it's

16:47.560 --> 16:50.440
trying to recreate it at a more accurate level with tone

16:50.440 --> 16:51.760
and character of voice.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.480
That's basically what they're doing here.

16:53.480 --> 16:56.160
And I think that demo really shows how you can hear it.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.400
The difference is now that machine learning

16:58.400 --> 17:02.400
has built some high-quality synthesis algorithms,

17:02.400 --> 17:03.560
they can apply that here.

17:03.560 --> 17:05.160
Before, all this still worked.

17:05.160 --> 17:06.840
Vocoders had been around since the 70s.

17:06.840 --> 17:07.360
Right.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.240
They just sucked.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.800
Yeah, they sure did.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.160
They were speak and spell.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.080
And now they're getting kind of legitimate.

17:13.080 --> 17:15.440
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

17:15.440 --> 17:19.040
So the folks over at NGINX are protesting a little bit

17:19.040 --> 17:20.320
too much.

17:20.320 --> 17:21.960
But they're getting a lot of heat.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.640
We had a pretty mild reaction to the NGINX purchase.

17:24.640 --> 17:25.960
Yeah, I thought so.

17:25.960 --> 17:28.280
You know, I didn't get Wimpy's hot take on it.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.960
I don't know, Wimpy, did you have any hot take reactions?

17:31.960 --> 17:32.600
First thoughts?

17:32.600 --> 17:35.120
What are other really zippy terms people

17:35.120 --> 17:37.160
use for immediate reactions?

17:37.160 --> 17:40.240
What are your first reactions to NGINX

17:40.240 --> 17:42.120
getting purchased by F5?

17:42.120 --> 17:43.640
Huge controversy, Wimpy?

17:43.640 --> 17:46.360
No, I think it speaks to the success of NGINX

17:46.360 --> 17:49.200
and how it dominates that space now.

17:49.200 --> 17:53.600
So I think congratulations to NGINX for all of the hard work

17:53.600 --> 17:55.320
that a lot of the people there have put in.

17:55.320 --> 17:58.680
And I hope they're going to benefit from that acquisition.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.880
I'm sure some of them will be getting some kickbacks.

18:00.880 --> 18:05.080
And I think it will cement NGINX's position

18:05.080 --> 18:09.200
in the market as the sort of Swiss army knife of proxying,

18:09.200 --> 18:13.520
reverse proxying, and fast serving of assets.

18:13.520 --> 18:14.920
Right, well said.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.800
Unfortunately, apparently you are a completely unreasonable

18:17.800 --> 18:19.840
shill, according to the open source community,

18:19.840 --> 18:20.680
because they are upset.

18:20.680 --> 18:25.920
But NGINX have had the open source

18:25.920 --> 18:28.540
and pro version of NGINX for years already.

18:28.540 --> 18:34.920
So that open core model is being established for some time,

18:34.920 --> 18:36.680
just because it's changed ownership.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.400
I mean, what does that change?

18:38.400 --> 18:39.000
Nothing.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.300
I don't think anyone was really thinking

18:40.300 --> 18:41.760
about the company behind it before.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.240
And suddenly, suddenly we are.

18:43.240 --> 18:44.840
It's the license, stupid.

18:44.840 --> 18:47.240
I mean, that really should be the tagline there.

18:47.240 --> 18:51.880
But NGINX writes on their blog, we've heard it loud and clear.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.320
We need to continue to demonstrate our commitment

18:54.320 --> 18:55.140
to open source.

18:55.140 --> 18:58.880
They go on to say, let me take a moment to be very explicit.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.040
F5 is committed to not only supporting

19:01.040 --> 19:05.360
the development of NGINX, the open source edition,

19:05.360 --> 19:08.200
as well as other NGINX open source projects,

19:08.200 --> 19:10.680
but also increasing our investment over time.

19:10.680 --> 19:14.520
Just to repeat that, F5 is committed

19:14.520 --> 19:17.120
to NGINX's open source technologies, developers,

19:17.120 --> 19:18.120
and community.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.040
I swear.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.580
OK, I might have added that last part.

19:20.580 --> 19:22.500
But they're really hitting this hard.

19:22.500 --> 19:23.000
They are.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.880
And to make an interesting point here,

19:24.880 --> 19:26.840
we're also seeing increased acceptance

19:26.840 --> 19:29.640
of mainstream companies as stewards

19:29.640 --> 19:31.400
of open source technologies.

19:31.400 --> 19:34.280
Microsoft bought GitHub, VMware bought Heptio,

19:34.280 --> 19:35.960
and IBM bought Red Hat.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.120
The assumption that big fish eats little fish

19:38.120 --> 19:41.960
means big fish kills open source project is outdated thinking.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.760
Going back to your point, Wimpy, that's

19:43.760 --> 19:46.160
the result of success to a degree.

19:46.160 --> 19:49.240
As they become more successful, large market players

19:49.240 --> 19:50.260
scoop them up.

19:50.260 --> 19:54.440
And also, before the acquisition, the pro version of NGINX

19:54.440 --> 19:57.840
provided the funding that organization needed,

19:57.840 --> 20:01.240
such that the open core version of NGINX

20:01.240 --> 20:03.680
was available as open source to all of us,

20:03.680 --> 20:07.600
so that your website and my website and millions of others

20:07.600 --> 20:12.920
are able to run with a well-supported, cutting edge

20:12.920 --> 20:16.520
web server and provide all sorts of nifty stuff

20:16.520 --> 20:18.080
like object caching.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.960
And if you are at web scale, you're

20:20.960 --> 20:22.920
obviously going to be making some money.

20:22.920 --> 20:25.240
And those pro features you can buy into

20:25.240 --> 20:28.040
are probably of importance to you

20:28.040 --> 20:30.160
and not so important to the likes of you and I.

20:30.160 --> 20:33.320
So I'm quite happy for these organizations

20:33.320 --> 20:35.360
to be producing open source software

20:35.360 --> 20:38.840
and have a markup on an enterprise version that

20:38.840 --> 20:42.240
means that they can continue to fund the open source stuff.

20:42.240 --> 20:42.820
Yeah.

20:42.820 --> 20:44.820
In fact, this live stream we're doing

20:44.820 --> 20:46.320
as we record the show right now is

20:46.320 --> 20:49.920
being powered by NGINX in multiple different ways.

20:49.920 --> 20:53.480
It is a Swiss Army knife of tools.

20:53.480 --> 20:57.960
And F5 is savvy for scooping it up.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.680
It shows that they're watching the market

20:59.680 --> 21:02.960
and they understand where there's overlap there.

21:02.960 --> 21:08.200
So there are moments where it's a little uncomfortable.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.040
I think that's particularly in open core.

21:11.040 --> 21:15.440
I think it's hard because the test is how engaged are they

21:15.440 --> 21:16.760
with the open source project?

21:16.760 --> 21:18.940
Because if they're just making money off proprietary features

21:18.940 --> 21:20.480
and not developing, then just dropping

21:20.480 --> 21:23.440
like a GZIP or a ZIP file somewhere,

21:23.440 --> 21:27.440
OK, there we've complied with the license has technically

21:27.440 --> 21:28.560
been complied with.

21:28.560 --> 21:30.360
So it can be hard, I think, especially as an outsider.

21:30.360 --> 21:33.320
But I don't think that's ever been the NGINX community.

21:33.320 --> 21:36.320
No, as NGINX were transitioning to their pro model,

21:36.320 --> 21:39.960
it used to be the case that you had to compile your modules

21:39.960 --> 21:43.540
into the NGINX binary at build time.

21:43.540 --> 21:45.520
And they went to great lengths to make

21:45.520 --> 21:49.240
that a modular architecture as they moved to the pro model

21:49.240 --> 21:51.840
so that they could continue to develop

21:51.840 --> 21:56.320
the core of NGINX independently of the modules that make up

21:56.320 --> 21:58.640
the pro enterprise version.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.640
So they've demonstrated in the past

22:00.640 --> 22:02.760
that they're committed to maintaining the open source

22:02.760 --> 22:03.880
roots of the project.

22:03.880 --> 22:06.920
Yeah, I think really the solution here

22:06.920 --> 22:08.920
is for NGINX to have said nothing.

22:08.920 --> 22:12.120
Just look at the absolute outrage

22:12.120 --> 22:13.880
over the GitHub purchase.

22:13.880 --> 22:17.360
And they just, as everybody was doing their mass exodus

22:17.360 --> 22:19.440
to GitLab, they just stayed cool.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.720
They didn't say anything.

22:20.720 --> 22:23.000
While GitLab was doing blog post after blog post

22:23.000 --> 22:25.720
about how to migrate and tweeting like crazy,

22:25.720 --> 22:28.320
they just sat there and didn't say anything.

22:28.320 --> 22:30.080
And now nobody talks about it.

22:30.080 --> 22:31.440
It's like, it's going to happen.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.680
And by the time the deal is finalized,

22:33.680 --> 22:36.100
it'll be like, oh, yeah, right, that, OK.

22:36.100 --> 22:38.180
And the only thing that can really prove their point

22:38.180 --> 22:39.560
is what's going to happen in the future

22:39.560 --> 22:41.060
and their continued involvement.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.120
Yeah, they say that here in the blog post.

22:43.120 --> 22:47.360
And it really, that is, I think, your and my overall opinion

22:47.360 --> 22:50.840
on these big acquisitions is sit back and see what happens.

22:50.840 --> 22:53.520
Just watch what happens, and then make your judgment then.

22:53.520 --> 22:55.120
And the great thing about open source

22:55.120 --> 22:57.160
is it comes back to that license, stupid.

22:57.160 --> 22:58.560
You've got that license.

22:58.560 --> 23:01.560
So if you don't like what they're doing, you're good to go.

23:01.560 --> 23:04.040
So let's talk to Mr. Cassidy, who joins us

23:04.040 --> 23:08.080
from the elementary project, who just had one of those,

23:08.080 --> 23:10.920
like, it had to be a calculated decision, Cassidy, I imagine.

23:10.920 --> 23:13.800
Like, do we do an April Fools announcement or not?

23:13.800 --> 23:16.120
Like, that must have been, right there, a hard call.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.960
Yeah, we've done April Fools in the past, and they've been fun.

23:18.960 --> 23:22.480
But this time we had some actual news,

23:22.480 --> 23:24.800
and we thought, why not just release that on April 1st?

23:24.800 --> 23:25.920
You know, have some fun.

23:25.920 --> 23:27.840
So you guys are announcing that the App Center

23:27.840 --> 23:29.040
will be using Flatpak.

23:29.040 --> 23:32.120
And I think it makes sense, you know, local repository

23:32.120 --> 23:36.000
that you curate yourself and all of that.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.300
I guess my first thought is, why is this an announcement,

23:39.300 --> 23:41.040
in a sense, and not to take away from it,

23:41.040 --> 23:43.040
but why is this an announcement to begin with?

23:43.040 --> 23:44.680
And walk me back from that.

23:44.680 --> 23:46.560
Like, why does this matter?

23:46.560 --> 23:48.920
How will this impact users and all of that?

23:48.920 --> 23:52.320
Yeah, so I mean, ever since these newer packaging formats

23:52.320 --> 23:54.840
started showing up with containerization

23:54.840 --> 23:57.360
and sandboxing, people have been asking elementary,

23:57.360 --> 23:59.200
you know, when are you going to jump on board?

23:59.200 --> 24:01.080
When are you going to jump on this bandwagon?

24:01.080 --> 24:05.820
And we've taken the approach of being, you know, kind of slower,

24:05.820 --> 24:09.480
methodical, intentional about not just jumping

24:09.480 --> 24:10.680
on a bandwagon.

24:10.680 --> 24:14.120
And to your credit, I'd say I've seen the project attend events

24:14.120 --> 24:16.640
from both communities, from the Flatpak and Snap community.

24:16.640 --> 24:19.400
So you've been active in both communities completely.

24:19.400 --> 24:20.020
Exactly, yeah.

24:20.020 --> 24:22.560
We've been kind of surveying the technologies,

24:22.560 --> 24:24.980
watching them really closely and engaging with people,

24:24.980 --> 24:27.720
but not just jumping on a bandwagon.

24:27.720 --> 24:31.080
So the difference now is that we've been, you know,

24:31.080 --> 24:34.900
since about 2015, we've been working on these technologies

24:34.900 --> 24:36.520
and talking to people.

24:36.520 --> 24:39.480
And I think Flatpak is really in a place

24:39.480 --> 24:42.240
now where it's getting more mature.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.320
We understand it a lot better, and we're

24:44.320 --> 24:46.600
starting to see those advantages.

24:46.600 --> 24:49.560
We're also starting to grow with App Center

24:49.560 --> 24:53.200
to a point where the advantages of a format like Flatpak

24:53.200 --> 24:55.720
would benefit both us and our users.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.180
So it really just is the right time

24:57.180 --> 24:59.080
to jump onto one of these new formats.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.260
And after a lot of back and forth and discussion

25:02.260 --> 25:05.360
with both our first party developers and our third party

25:05.360 --> 25:08.080
developers and the people who are making these formats

25:08.080 --> 25:11.480
themselves, we decided that Flatpak was most closely

25:11.480 --> 25:12.760
aligned to our needs.

25:12.760 --> 25:15.440
So why not just do like a little quiet sneaky implementation

25:15.440 --> 25:16.080
on the back end?

25:16.080 --> 25:18.400
Why do the whole announcement about it?

25:18.400 --> 25:20.840
I think we've started to actually do

25:20.840 --> 25:24.760
the sneaky implementation on the back end in a few places.

25:24.760 --> 25:29.740
There's a branch of App Center that supports Flatpak already.

25:29.740 --> 25:32.120
And people are going to start seeing those things

25:32.120 --> 25:32.960
and start talking.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.720
So we might as well get out in front of it

25:34.720 --> 25:38.600
and really be intentional about the message around it.

25:38.600 --> 25:43.440
I was surprised because I wasn't sure how you felt as a project

25:43.440 --> 25:47.080
that it seemed like some of the what would be otherwise

25:47.080 --> 25:50.120
kind of like elementary OS exclusives

25:50.120 --> 25:52.120
were getting Flatpacked up by the community

25:52.120 --> 25:53.480
and spread around other distros.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.120
And it's kind of like at one point,

25:55.120 --> 25:57.480
that's great because it means more open source software.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.040
Native applications on the desktop

25:59.040 --> 26:00.680
are available to everybody.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.800
But in another way, it's not as great

26:02.800 --> 26:05.360
because these applications are designed

26:05.360 --> 26:07.220
to be part of a larger environment.

26:07.220 --> 26:09.600
And they kind of feel out of place on other desktops.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.360
And I feel like it doesn't do a full service

26:11.360 --> 26:14.720
to the complete elementary OS experience.

26:14.720 --> 26:17.480
And not to mention, you get like these probably crazy bug

26:17.480 --> 26:19.680
reports from somebody on Fedora Rawhide

26:19.680 --> 26:20.720
that's trying to get somebody who's

26:20.720 --> 26:22.720
making an elementary OS app to fix their problem.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.720
So I thought maybe as a project, you guys were not

26:25.720 --> 26:27.520
a big fan of that arrangement.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.840
There's kind of three aspects of these newer containerized

26:30.840 --> 26:32.480
formats like Flatpack.

26:32.480 --> 26:36.840
There's the packaging itself, just like Debian packaging

26:36.840 --> 26:38.040
or whatever.

26:38.040 --> 26:40.980
There's the containerization or sandboxing.

26:40.980 --> 26:43.960
And then there's the cross-platform aspect.

26:43.960 --> 26:47.960
We're really adopting that first of three elements to start.

26:47.960 --> 26:51.840
We're just adopting it as a packaging format to start.

26:51.840 --> 26:53.920
And that means it should be really seamless.

26:53.920 --> 26:57.640
Nobody should really notice any differences on elementary OS.

26:57.640 --> 27:01.880
The sandboxing part is the reason we're adopting it.

27:01.880 --> 27:04.600
It's the better security and privacy.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.560
We've been doing a lot of work on that front.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.760
And that's the kind of future we're moving towards,

27:08.760 --> 27:12.560
that A, it'll make app reviews easier on the app center side.

27:12.560 --> 27:17.000
And B, it also just makes users' devices more secure

27:17.000 --> 27:19.880
and respecting their privacy more.

27:19.880 --> 27:22.520
The third aspect, the cross-platform part,

27:22.520 --> 27:26.040
isn't really a concern or a driving factor

27:26.040 --> 27:28.320
at all for us with elementary.

27:28.320 --> 27:29.120
It's neat.

27:29.120 --> 27:29.760
It's cool.

27:29.760 --> 27:31.440
It's a thing that exists there.

27:31.440 --> 27:33.840
But the cross-platform part, while it's

27:33.840 --> 27:36.500
very loudly one of the primary reasons for these formats

27:36.500 --> 27:38.780
to exist, it's not actually one of the reasons

27:38.780 --> 27:41.280
we're adopting it or one of the things we're really

27:41.280 --> 27:42.360
investing time in.

27:42.360 --> 27:42.880
Yeah.

27:42.880 --> 27:43.760
Yeah, I understand.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.640
I think there's probably some advantage, too,

27:45.640 --> 27:50.200
that Flatpack is very closely tracking GNOME features

27:50.200 --> 27:54.480
and GTK features, which elementary OS uses a lot of GTK.

27:54.480 --> 27:56.120
So there's some advantages there, right,

27:56.120 --> 27:59.440
when they make a change that affects the overall GTK

27:59.440 --> 28:03.240
ecosystem that is overall maybe something very nice,

28:03.240 --> 28:06.120
like a new way to access a device or something like that.

28:06.120 --> 28:10.440
You, as a project, automatically get to take advantage of that.

28:10.440 --> 28:10.960
Exactly.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.280
Yeah, it's really closely aligned

28:12.280 --> 28:14.520
with the stack of technologies we use.

28:14.520 --> 28:18.440
As we work more and more with folks that work on GNOME,

28:18.440 --> 28:20.960
we see projects like GTK actually

28:20.960 --> 28:24.640
get better because there's multiple projects using GTK.

28:24.640 --> 28:26.600
If GTK was only used by GNOME, it

28:26.600 --> 28:30.560
might be a little bit restricted in how it can be used.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.680
But because you have XFCE and elementary

28:32.680 --> 28:36.840
and other desktops that are using GTK, it makes GTK better.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.620
We feel the same about Flatpack.

28:38.620 --> 28:40.360
It's not technically a GNOME project,

28:40.360 --> 28:42.880
but a lot of people from GNOME are working on it.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.960
And so by having yet another project

28:44.960 --> 28:48.060
throw their weight behind it, it will

28:48.060 --> 28:50.160
make the technology itself better as well.

28:50.160 --> 28:52.160
So this is going to be something you guys work on probably

28:52.160 --> 28:55.000
for a period of time because it sounds like it may not even

28:55.000 --> 28:57.600
land as the default way to package software for Juno

28:57.600 --> 28:58.160
itself.

28:58.160 --> 28:59.960
So this could be something that takes a little while

28:59.960 --> 29:00.640
to implement.

29:00.640 --> 29:01.280
Right, yeah.

29:01.280 --> 29:02.960
So today, nothing is changing as far

29:02.960 --> 29:05.220
as how apps are being developed and distributed

29:05.220 --> 29:06.120
on elementary OS.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.840
It's still using the App Center dashboard

29:08.840 --> 29:10.560
with the Debian formatting.

29:10.560 --> 29:12.400
But we wanted to get this out there

29:12.400 --> 29:15.560
to kind of let our developer community know what's coming

29:15.560 --> 29:17.120
and start to get feedback from them

29:17.120 --> 29:18.520
as we work through these issues.

29:18.520 --> 29:20.520
So there's two main things we have to do.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.360
We have to implement it in App Center itself, the client side

29:23.360 --> 29:26.960
app, which work is progressing there really well.

29:26.960 --> 29:29.360
And then we also have to implement it on the back end,

29:29.360 --> 29:31.620
what we call App Center dashboard, where developers

29:31.620 --> 29:33.720
actually submit their applications.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.960
That work hasn't started yet, but we're

29:35.960 --> 29:37.880
starting to look at that and kind of investigate

29:37.880 --> 29:39.160
how we're going to do that.

29:39.160 --> 29:40.880
So it's going to be a long process,

29:40.880 --> 29:44.280
and it may not even come to Juno itself as an update.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.720
We're still deciding how that migration will work.

29:46.720 --> 29:50.080
But we wanted to get the news out there for our app developers

29:50.080 --> 29:51.120
to know what's coming.

29:51.120 --> 29:54.240
So I guess my last question would really be with this.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.580
Is there anything in this that really inherently

29:56.580 --> 29:59.580
prevents elementary OS from continuing to just use snaps

29:59.580 --> 30:01.960
if the user wants to install a snap themselves?

30:01.960 --> 30:03.640
No, of course not.

30:03.640 --> 30:07.400
We're deciding to use Flatpak for the out-of-box experience

30:07.400 --> 30:11.120
of App Center and elementary OS.

30:11.120 --> 30:13.200
Developers or users are always free to do whatever

30:13.200 --> 30:14.720
they want on their own systems.

30:14.720 --> 30:17.400
They can install Snap, or they can install Debs,

30:17.400 --> 30:20.280
or they can sideload whatever they can compile from tarballs.

30:20.280 --> 30:23.720
So whatever the user wants to do, it'll still work.

30:23.720 --> 30:27.320
This is just about the supported default experience

30:27.320 --> 30:28.320
for Map Center.

30:28.320 --> 30:30.840
Right, and in a sense, it's an implementation detail, isn't it?

30:30.840 --> 30:33.040
It's really not a user-facing concern.

30:33.040 --> 30:33.720
Exactly, yeah.

30:33.720 --> 30:37.480
If we do our job correctly, then most users

30:37.480 --> 30:40.640
shouldn't even really realize what's going on under the hood.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.440
Yeah, and it makes total sense.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.520
You want your own repo.

30:43.520 --> 30:44.600
You want to curate it yourselves.

30:44.600 --> 30:45.900
You've got your own App Center.

30:45.900 --> 30:47.960
You want to publish applications for that.

30:47.960 --> 30:49.080
It totally makes sense.

30:49.080 --> 30:52.080
And it seems like you guys are thinking a lot about security,

30:52.080 --> 30:54.320
too, which I really appreciate, especially

30:54.320 --> 30:56.960
as this is the distro I recommend to friends and family.

30:56.960 --> 30:59.160
It does seem like a particularly good match in that sense,

30:59.160 --> 31:00.760
the same abstractions that are trying

31:00.760 --> 31:01.880
to fight the same problems.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.000
Yeah, yeah.

31:03.000 --> 31:03.560
Exactly.

31:03.560 --> 31:04.280
Well, thanks, Cassie.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.680
Thanks for joining us and explaining it to us.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.880
And we'll have a link to the entire Medium post, which

31:07.880 --> 31:09.160
goes into a lot more details.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.620
Was there anything else you wanted

31:10.620 --> 31:13.400
to mention to make clear before we continue on, or is that?

31:13.400 --> 31:14.000
Are we good?

31:14.000 --> 31:16.520
I'm probably going to write up a follow-up post about this.

31:16.520 --> 31:20.040
But we've been getting a lot of great feedback on social media,

31:20.040 --> 31:22.640
people having concerns about, oh, I've

31:22.640 --> 31:24.880
had issues with accessing external devices

31:24.880 --> 31:27.800
with Flatpaks, or I've had issues with app sizes being

31:27.800 --> 31:31.560
huge or downloading giant SDKs with Flatpaks.

31:31.560 --> 31:33.920
And I do want to clarify that the way we're

31:33.920 --> 31:38.000
implementing Flatpak will be a very, very specific

31:38.000 --> 31:39.880
and considered implementation.

31:39.880 --> 31:45.080
So to start, we're going to make sure that those permissions can

31:45.080 --> 31:47.960
be very permissive, because we already review and curate

31:47.960 --> 31:50.680
and test all apps that are submitted to App Center.

31:50.680 --> 31:52.780
So we don't have to have the locked down permissions

31:52.780 --> 31:56.200
to start that might break things like external devices.

31:56.200 --> 31:58.720
So to start, there shouldn't be any big difference there

31:58.720 --> 32:01.360
as far as issues that other people have seen

32:01.360 --> 32:04.360
with other Flatpak implementations and things

32:04.360 --> 32:06.560
like app sizes.

32:06.560 --> 32:09.800
Similarly, we'll have a specific SDK

32:09.800 --> 32:12.560
that developers must target when they submit to App Center.

32:12.560 --> 32:15.440
So it's not like you'll download the entire GNOME

32:15.440 --> 32:19.320
3.22 SDK for one app.

32:19.320 --> 32:21.640
It'll use the SDK that's already installed on the system,

32:21.640 --> 32:23.840
so it won't have a 2 gig download or whatever,

32:23.840 --> 32:26.720
like people have seen with a lot of things on Flathub.

32:26.720 --> 32:30.600
So Flatpak is just a technology.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.280
It has lots of different implementations,

32:32.280 --> 32:34.560
and we're being really careful with our implementation

32:34.560 --> 32:36.960
to make sure that it solves these issues.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.440
You're going to get it right, it sounds like.

32:38.440 --> 32:40.840
That's a very good detail, because it's

32:40.840 --> 32:42.520
a totally separate implementation.

32:42.520 --> 32:44.640
So if you might have had a bad experience,

32:44.640 --> 32:46.640
that's no reason to write off all the hard work

32:46.640 --> 32:47.600
you guys are doing.

32:47.600 --> 32:48.560
Yeah, all right.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.280
Well, Cassidy, thank you very much.

32:50.280 --> 32:52.400
Cassidy from the Elementary OS Project,

32:52.400 --> 32:54.440
check out the link in the show notes.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.600
It was good to have you with us.

32:55.600 --> 32:56.040
Thank you, sir.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.960
You're welcome to stick around for the show.

32:57.960 --> 33:00.340
We'll just cover a couple more community news stories

33:00.340 --> 33:02.440
before we get out of here.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.880
First up, the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

33:04.880 --> 33:07.460
They're actually not actually positive,

33:07.460 --> 33:09.160
because there's two different branches.

33:09.160 --> 33:11.120
So I don't know if this is the foundation or not,

33:11.120 --> 33:17.480
but Raspberry Pi folk have an official keyboard and mouse

33:17.480 --> 33:19.120
that is available for sale.

33:19.120 --> 33:21.080
And one of the selling pitches of the keyboard,

33:21.080 --> 33:24.640
besides its small size, is it's integrated with a USB hub.

33:24.640 --> 33:27.000
I mean, you're going to need one of those anyway, right?

33:27.000 --> 33:30.320
There's no way your laptop has anywhere enough ports.

33:30.320 --> 33:32.680
Mine, I mean, actually, this one's pretty good.

33:32.680 --> 33:34.920
Yeah, or Raspberry Pi.

33:34.920 --> 33:36.840
Yeah, I mean, whatever device you're plugging into.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.000
I was just immediately thinking that it looks so nice

33:39.000 --> 33:41.640
that I would probably be using it not just on my Pis,

33:41.640 --> 33:43.000
but on all my systems.

33:43.000 --> 33:43.760
Yeah, you could.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.560
It's just a cute little three-button scroll wheel

33:46.560 --> 33:49.000
optical device with Raspberry Pi logos for the mouse.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.600
It's a little USB cable, but it's white and red,

33:51.600 --> 33:53.640
which is a cute little color scheme.

33:53.640 --> 33:54.820
Yeah, it looks nice.

33:54.820 --> 33:58.640
And then just like a pretty standard 78-key matrix

33:58.640 --> 34:01.280
for the keyboard, which you probably would see on a laptop

34:01.280 --> 34:02.160
keyboard.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.920
What's interesting, though, is they've

34:03.920 --> 34:07.720
worked on some custom firmware so that hopefully,

34:07.720 --> 34:09.760
with a little magic, it can auto-detect

34:09.760 --> 34:11.560
what country the keyboard is configured for

34:11.560 --> 34:12.960
and just sort of work right.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.840
So you'll be able to get a keyboard that's

34:14.840 --> 34:18.360
manufactured in a simple, easy way that will work wherever

34:18.360 --> 34:19.360
you are in the world.

34:19.360 --> 34:22.000
Yeah, it's kind of worth reading the Raspberry Pi blog

34:22.000 --> 34:24.120
post in the show notes, because they

34:24.120 --> 34:27.600
talk about the care they went to to make it a good keyboard

34:27.600 --> 34:28.360
experience.

34:28.360 --> 34:29.160
And they're like, this turned out

34:29.160 --> 34:33.000
to be a little more challenging than we expected, turns out.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.680
The Raspberry Pi official keyboard and mouse

34:35.680 --> 34:38.400
are available now from approved resellers.

34:38.400 --> 34:41.920
And I decided to do it.

34:41.920 --> 34:42.760
I got the keyboard.

34:42.760 --> 34:45.960
The mouse wasn't available from the place I wanted to buy from.

34:45.960 --> 34:46.960
So I got the keyboard.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.120
I ordered it this morning.

34:48.120 --> 34:49.560
I'm going to be curious to try it.

34:49.560 --> 34:50.240
It wasn't bad.

34:50.240 --> 34:54.200
It was like, I think it was like maybe after shipping and tax

34:54.200 --> 34:56.200
and everything, it was like $27.

34:56.200 --> 34:57.240
Yeah, that's not bad.

34:57.240 --> 34:57.920
No.

34:57.920 --> 35:01.600
And the mouse is something like around $20 US.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.400
And maybe I'll pick it up later, but I

35:03.400 --> 35:07.280
was thinking about doing a segment about a cheap Amazon

35:07.280 --> 35:11.480
LCD HDMI screen and using this and just

35:11.480 --> 35:15.200
like the cheap, easy, bare bones Raspberry Pi setup that

35:15.200 --> 35:17.720
makes it easy to just bang out Raspberry Pi projects,

35:17.720 --> 35:18.840
like a segment around that.

35:18.840 --> 35:20.800
And so I thought, you know, I was actually,

35:20.800 --> 35:22.720
literally when I was thinking about that segment,

35:22.720 --> 35:24.400
I was like, I don't have a great keyboard.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.200
And then, I'm not even joking, I woke up

35:26.200 --> 35:27.360
and I saw this announcement.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.560
So I thought, maybe it was a sign I should try this.

35:29.560 --> 35:32.800
That or it's a good excuse to order a $20, $30 keyboard.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.640
So I'll let you know what I think about it.

35:34.640 --> 35:36.640
Also, something that I thought was kind of neat

35:36.640 --> 35:40.480
is I think this might have been sent into the show too.

35:40.480 --> 35:41.800
Make Pro Audio.

35:41.800 --> 35:46.760
This is a DIY kit that you can get for the Raspberry Pi.

35:46.760 --> 35:48.520
And you build modules around it, turn it

35:48.520 --> 35:50.640
into a professional audio.

35:50.640 --> 35:52.020
I'll just leave in the show notes.

35:52.020 --> 35:54.040
We don't need to go into it a lot.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.360
I think the thing that's really cool about it,

35:56.360 --> 35:59.520
it's a company that's well known for make your own audio

35:59.520 --> 36:00.020
gear.

36:00.020 --> 36:02.560
The Make Pro Audio company, that's what they're known for.

36:02.560 --> 36:06.440
And they have all kinds of modules

36:06.440 --> 36:08.240
they've already built for other things.

36:08.240 --> 36:10.560
So they're sort of known for creating these platforms

36:10.560 --> 36:13.160
to build very professional audio kits around.

36:13.160 --> 36:15.040
And they're doing a build your own audio gear

36:15.040 --> 36:17.600
platform for the Raspberry Pi.

36:17.600 --> 36:18.100
Right.

36:18.100 --> 36:19.880
So you already have a huge access

36:19.880 --> 36:21.720
to just a huge number of modules.

36:21.720 --> 36:23.120
And now they have the code needed

36:23.120 --> 36:25.960
to fit the Raspberry Pi into that existing platform.

36:25.960 --> 36:26.600
Yeah.

36:26.600 --> 36:27.560
And it snaps in there.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.560
And then you've got a fancy Linux computer controlling

36:29.560 --> 36:30.880
all that kind of stuff.

36:30.880 --> 36:31.760
It's really cool.

36:31.760 --> 36:32.520
It's really neat.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.040
Well, go check it out.

36:34.040 --> 36:36.160
For those of you who care, go check it out.

36:36.160 --> 36:37.280
It'll be in the show notes.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.520
I already want a little Raspberry Pi mixer

36:39.520 --> 36:40.700
for my home studio closet.

36:40.700 --> 36:41.440
I'm not going to lie.

36:41.440 --> 36:41.920
Yeah.

36:41.920 --> 36:43.920
I know, right?

36:43.920 --> 36:44.400
I know.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.140
You and I geek out on this kind of stuff.

36:46.140 --> 36:49.320
Well, our last bit of community news for this week

36:49.320 --> 36:52.280
is from our own Mr. Martin Wimperis in the mumble room

36:52.280 --> 36:53.080
right now.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.800
And it is Ubuntu Mate 1804 Beta 1.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.880
So it's the LTS for Raspberry Pi.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.600
It's a beta pre-release.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.600
So it's hot off the presses right now.

37:02.600 --> 37:05.140
It's a great opportunity to give Martin your feedback.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.320
And Wimpy, you know what I'm most excited about

37:07.320 --> 37:09.240
is that hardware-accelerated VLC.

37:09.240 --> 37:10.880
That's huge.

37:10.880 --> 37:11.780
You like that, do you?

37:11.780 --> 37:13.280
I like that a lot.

37:13.280 --> 37:17.720
I mean, I thought maybe you would get there.

37:17.720 --> 37:20.880
But when we were kind of chatting off the show,

37:20.880 --> 37:23.480
my expectations had been set for this maybe not

37:23.480 --> 37:24.620
to happen in this release.

37:24.620 --> 37:27.880
And then I see the announcement, and you nailed it.

37:27.880 --> 37:29.640
So I'm curious how we went from, I

37:29.640 --> 37:31.920
don't think it's going to happen, to, oh, by the way,

37:31.920 --> 37:33.200
it's a feature now.

37:33.200 --> 37:37.520
We were rather fortunate in, as I was entering the final stages

37:37.520 --> 37:40.840
of preparing these images, the Raspberry Pi Foundation dropped

37:40.840 --> 37:46.520
patches for current versions of VLC and some other software,

37:46.520 --> 37:49.920
which made it possible for me to enable this.

37:49.920 --> 37:53.060
So all down to the work that they're doing, yeah.

37:53.060 --> 37:54.480
Open source is amazing.

37:54.480 --> 37:54.980
Isn't it?

37:54.980 --> 37:56.520
That is so great.

37:56.520 --> 37:57.320
Jeez.

37:57.320 --> 38:00.120
So not only VLC, but FFmpeg as well.

38:00.120 --> 38:03.120
So kind of the standout here is maybe now the web browser.

38:03.120 --> 38:03.760
Is that right?

38:03.760 --> 38:06.680
So I'm a fair way along in doing that.

38:06.680 --> 38:09.120
I actually have a build of Chromium

38:09.120 --> 38:11.800
that is fully accelerated for the Raspberry Pi,

38:11.800 --> 38:15.960
again, because literally this weekend, the Raspberry Pi

38:15.960 --> 38:21.480
Foundation dropped patches for current versions of Chromium.

38:21.480 --> 38:26.440
Now, the issue that I have is a rather complicated one

38:26.440 --> 38:31.280
in that the builders for ARM in Launchpad are based on ARM64.

38:31.280 --> 38:34.600
And obviously, the Raspberry Pi is a 32-bit ARM.

38:34.600 --> 38:37.320
And the cross-build environment is

38:37.320 --> 38:42.220
leaking a bit of the 64-bit nature of the host underneath.

38:42.220 --> 38:44.560
And I'm running into a few issues

38:44.560 --> 38:48.000
where it's picking up, oh, this should be 64-bit

38:48.000 --> 38:49.280
when actually it's 32-bit.

38:49.280 --> 38:51.800
So I'm just having to patch my way through that.

38:51.800 --> 38:55.720
But the problem is Chromium takes about 26 hours

38:55.720 --> 38:59.840
to build on ARM, even in Launchpad.

38:59.840 --> 39:04.400
So my iteration cycle is currently around 11 hours

39:04.400 --> 39:07.480
to find out whether or not my fixes are working.

39:07.480 --> 39:11.460
So I had a failure condition at about four hours and a half,

39:11.460 --> 39:13.040
and then at seven and a half hours.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.800
And now the current problem I'm fighting

39:15.800 --> 39:18.360
is about 11 and a half hours into the build.

39:18.360 --> 39:19.920
So I'm slowly getting there.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.980
But I hope, maybe not for release,

39:21.980 --> 39:25.560
but it'll certainly be a post-install option,

39:25.560 --> 39:28.560
an accelerated version of Chromium.

39:28.560 --> 39:30.800
I'd like to have it baked in, but we'll just

39:30.800 --> 39:32.360
have to see how it goes.

39:32.360 --> 39:36.960
Like I say, the iteration time is pretty long.

39:36.960 --> 39:37.920
That is brutal.

39:37.920 --> 39:40.900
So even more kudos to you for fighting through that.

39:40.900 --> 39:43.320
I love that ffmpeg and VLC at least got this.

39:43.320 --> 39:46.360
Because if you think about it, this is the 1804 LTS.

39:46.360 --> 39:49.400
So this could be running on some Pi's for a while.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.880
This could stick around for a while.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.600
So it's really nice to see that.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.400
I think the other thing that's really clever

39:54.400 --> 39:57.640
that you've included in this release is Steam Link.

39:57.640 --> 39:58.940
How'd you get that idea?

39:58.940 --> 40:00.400
Well, yeah, so that was obviously

40:00.400 --> 40:02.240
made available for the Raspberry Pi

40:02.240 --> 40:05.320
shortly after Valve discontinued the hardware

40:05.320 --> 40:07.720
devices of Steam Link.

40:07.720 --> 40:11.440
And it just occurred to me that that is a really good use

40:11.440 --> 40:15.000
case for a Raspberry Pi to create a head-end unit

40:15.000 --> 40:17.520
for your Steam streaming.

40:17.520 --> 40:19.120
So yeah, I put a bit of work in there.

40:19.120 --> 40:21.960
This is actually the opposite kind of problem,

40:21.960 --> 40:27.920
where I had to port older libraries to the system

40:27.920 --> 40:32.680
and not have them tread on the newer versions that are in 1804.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.840
So there was a little bit of delicate refactoring

40:35.840 --> 40:38.960
of some packages to provide some older versions of things

40:38.960 --> 40:42.080
that sit alongside current versions of things.

40:42.080 --> 40:44.320
But yeah, I'm pretty happy with that.

40:44.320 --> 40:46.040
Something I would like people to test,

40:46.040 --> 40:48.920
I can't obviously fix Steam Link itself,

40:48.920 --> 40:53.400
because that's all built from upstream binary blobs.

40:53.400 --> 40:56.920
I can't recompile it, but I'd certainly

40:56.920 --> 40:59.200
appreciate some feedback on how it's working.

40:59.200 --> 41:02.120
You know what strikes me about creating a distribution

41:02.120 --> 41:04.000
for the Raspberry Pi?

41:04.000 --> 41:07.840
Most distros have to be compatible with almost all

41:07.840 --> 41:11.240
of the x86 machines in the market, in theory.

41:11.240 --> 41:14.280
You expect that if it's an x86 machine with standard hardware,

41:14.280 --> 41:15.720
a distro will run on it.

41:15.720 --> 41:17.720
But a distribution built for the Raspberry Pi,

41:17.720 --> 41:21.160
there's really only like four or five, maybe three,

41:21.160 --> 41:23.240
devices you should expect it to run really well on

41:23.240 --> 41:24.600
that you have to test on.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.200
I'm not trying to say it's easy.

41:26.200 --> 41:29.920
I'm saying it is an opportunity.

41:29.920 --> 41:32.080
If this was a full-time job, and you

41:32.080 --> 41:34.240
had a team of developers, you could

41:34.240 --> 41:36.920
buy each one of them, the entire range of Raspberry Pis.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.120
They could do all of their quality assurance testing

41:39.120 --> 41:39.440
on that.

41:39.440 --> 41:41.560
They could stamp it with their quality seal of approval

41:41.560 --> 41:44.880
and say, Mr. Wimpy, we have tested on every single Raspberry

41:44.880 --> 41:45.380
Pi.

41:45.380 --> 41:48.480
It is a manageable, scopable problem.

41:48.480 --> 41:49.480
And that's interesting.

41:49.480 --> 41:53.360
I have all four of the Raspberry Pis that this will run on.

41:53.360 --> 41:57.440
And it's not an expensive outlay to buy all four of them.

41:57.440 --> 42:01.600
It's under $100 to own all four of those computers.

42:01.600 --> 42:07.560
But unlike x86, everything about this is extremely bespoke.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.120
It's got its own bootloader.

42:09.120 --> 42:10.840
It's got its own custom kernel.

42:10.840 --> 42:16.400
It's got its own bespoke way of enabling Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

42:16.400 --> 42:20.600
It's got its own considerations regarding GPIO.

42:20.600 --> 42:23.840
Then you've got things like Python module support,

42:23.840 --> 42:27.520
adding things like USB boot support, frame buffer support.

42:27.520 --> 42:28.940
And then we've got all that we've

42:28.940 --> 42:31.920
talked about with hardware acceleration.

42:31.920 --> 42:36.160
And then you have people who have some expectation of what

42:36.160 --> 42:39.160
you do with a Raspberry Pi because of Raspbian

42:39.160 --> 42:41.640
and the tools that exist in Raspbian.

42:41.640 --> 42:44.680
And if those tools are not available in a Raspberry Pi

42:44.680 --> 42:48.520
distro, then that is alien because a lot of the time,

42:48.520 --> 42:51.840
people using the Raspberry Pi don't think of themselves

42:51.840 --> 42:52.760
as Linux users.

42:52.760 --> 42:55.900
They think of themselves as Raspberry Pi users.

42:55.900 --> 42:59.020
So you have to then make sure that those tools are available

42:59.020 --> 43:01.400
and ported because there are, in fact,

43:01.400 --> 43:04.440
considerable differences between Raspbian and Ubuntu.

43:04.440 --> 43:06.680
So there's a tool called RaspiConfig

43:06.680 --> 43:08.920
that a lot of people will be familiar with.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.440
And I've ported that from Raspbian to Ubuntu

43:11.440 --> 43:13.800
and catered for the differences that exist

43:13.800 --> 43:15.200
between the two platforms.

43:15.200 --> 43:18.720
Yeah, it is not as easy as I just made it sound.

43:18.720 --> 43:21.540
But it's a fascinating, it almost,

43:21.540 --> 43:24.620
Billy, doesn't it kind of remind you of the Android versus iOS

43:24.620 --> 43:25.960
development paradigm?

43:25.960 --> 43:27.960
Yeah, exactly.

43:27.960 --> 43:30.520
Maybe a little bit lesser because on Android,

43:30.520 --> 43:33.840
we're working with Java, but definitely.

43:33.840 --> 43:36.080
Yeah, and Billy does a little Android development.

43:36.080 --> 43:38.160
And he says sometimes, he feels a little jealous

43:38.160 --> 43:39.900
when you look over at the iOS side.

43:39.900 --> 43:41.400
There's less devices to target.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.000
Yeah, it's not just a big old mess.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.080
Imagine if the Raspberry Pi was much, much, much, much larger.

43:46.080 --> 43:48.720
And it was maybe much more mainstream.

43:48.720 --> 43:50.560
Maybe that's where the bulk of the users were.

43:50.560 --> 43:52.160
So it wasn't so bespoke.

43:52.160 --> 43:53.820
I don't know if that'd be a great future.

43:53.820 --> 43:56.480
But in a way, it would be less fragmentation.

43:56.480 --> 43:58.440
I think it's a really great device to target.

43:58.440 --> 44:00.600
I mean, I think they announced just recently they've

44:00.600 --> 44:02.840
sold 25 million Raspberry Pi.

44:02.840 --> 44:04.240
Now, I don't know how many of those

44:04.240 --> 44:08.880
are the Raspberry Pi 2, 3, 3 Plus, and 3a Plus.

44:08.880 --> 44:12.760
But I imagine it's probably the lion's share of those.

44:12.760 --> 44:15.800
So it's a large audience to hit.

44:15.800 --> 44:17.360
So it's a great way to do this.

44:17.360 --> 44:19.360
And the one thing I've done this time, of course,

44:19.360 --> 44:23.400
we've got 32-bit ARM and 64-bit ARM images.

44:23.400 --> 44:26.520
Now, there's some caveats with the 64-bit version.

44:26.520 --> 44:30.160
But it does mean that now, on an expensive device,

44:30.160 --> 44:36.080
if you want to create projects to target Ubuntu on ARM,

44:36.080 --> 44:37.920
you've now got a ubiquitous platform

44:37.920 --> 44:41.640
that you can now test your applications on 32-bit ARM

44:41.640 --> 44:42.960
and 64-bit ARM.

44:42.960 --> 44:44.160
They're good enough for that.

44:44.160 --> 44:47.240
The 64-bit systems are missing pretty much all

44:47.240 --> 44:49.680
of this hardware acceleration that we've

44:49.680 --> 44:56.080
discussed because it's simply not available for 64-bit ARM.

44:56.080 --> 44:58.880
It's really, I mean, it's amazing that all of this

44:58.880 --> 45:01.840
works as well as it does on such a different environment.

45:01.840 --> 45:02.720
I know.

45:02.720 --> 45:05.980
It does feel like it's moon computers.

45:05.980 --> 45:07.520
It's a totally different system.

45:07.520 --> 45:09.200
And we're making contact.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.800
And they're building the spaceships

45:10.800 --> 45:12.760
to get us there right now.

45:12.760 --> 45:15.240
Well, I think it's looking like a solid release.

45:15.240 --> 45:16.160
It's in beta right now.

45:16.160 --> 45:17.960
So folks, go give it a try.

45:17.960 --> 45:20.120
And it's just one SD card flash away.

45:20.120 --> 45:21.200
So why not?

45:21.200 --> 45:24.080
That's one of the things I think that makes the Raspberry Pi so

45:24.080 --> 45:27.880
approachable is you can get a fairly reasonably priced SD

45:27.880 --> 45:30.520
card, throw an image on there, and try it and swap it out.

45:30.520 --> 45:32.540
Or use that fancy new USB boot.

45:32.540 --> 45:34.000
You know what it's like?

45:34.000 --> 45:35.760
It's like floppy disk.

45:35.760 --> 45:38.760
Back in the day, I would have my entire operating system

45:38.760 --> 45:39.520
on a floppy disk.

45:39.520 --> 45:42.200
And I would have custom bespoke floppy disk

45:42.200 --> 45:45.320
for different games with optimized environments.

45:45.320 --> 45:47.200
And I would boot from a floppy drive.

45:47.200 --> 45:49.440
And now we're doing it with SD cards and Raspberry Pis.

45:49.440 --> 45:52.120
And I just now made that connection.

45:52.120 --> 45:53.840
Why is it taking me so long to realize

45:53.840 --> 45:56.040
these are floppy disks all over again?

45:56.040 --> 45:57.880
Now, where can we find a floppy disk

45:57.880 --> 45:59.280
reader for the Raspberry Pi?

45:59.280 --> 46:00.240
That's my next question.

46:00.240 --> 46:01.200
Yeah, well, you know what?

46:01.200 --> 46:02.200
It's got to be out there.

46:02.200 --> 46:04.040
There's a floppy disk that has an SD card.

46:04.040 --> 46:06.440
It's like an SD card adapter, like the floppy.

46:06.440 --> 46:07.840
That's got to be a thing.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.400
That has got to be a thing.

46:09.400 --> 46:11.760
I'm not trying to get all the secrets out of System76.

46:11.760 --> 46:17.480
But I'm wondering if Emma would tell us, on a scale of 1 to 10,

46:17.480 --> 46:18.040
maybe.

46:18.040 --> 46:18.960
I don't know.

46:18.960 --> 46:20.600
If there's any kind of hint, maybe,

46:20.600 --> 46:23.220
that System76 has looked at these ARM devices

46:23.220 --> 46:25.800
and thought, maybe there's something here we could ship.

46:25.800 --> 46:28.200
Maybe there's a product out of this.

46:28.200 --> 46:29.560
What can you reveal, Emma?

46:29.560 --> 46:32.120
I really don't think that they have been

46:32.120 --> 46:33.640
looking into that at all.

46:33.640 --> 46:36.280
So no all-pink Raspberry Pi?

46:36.280 --> 46:39.880
No ARM laptop or something like that?

46:39.880 --> 46:41.360
I mean, it's possible.

46:41.360 --> 46:44.200
But I haven't been part of any of the discussions.

46:44.200 --> 46:47.600
I know the ARM server is our biggest performer

46:47.600 --> 46:49.680
with the ARM market.

46:49.680 --> 46:51.600
So you do sell an ARM product, then, I guess,

46:51.600 --> 46:52.800
in the server space.

46:52.800 --> 46:53.440
Yeah.

46:53.440 --> 46:55.160
It's a bit of a beast, too, if I recall.

46:55.160 --> 46:56.600
Yes, the ibex.

46:56.600 --> 46:57.440
Yeah.

46:57.440 --> 46:58.640
Are you looking it up right now?

46:58.640 --> 47:00.560
Yeah, Wes is going over there right now to go check it out.

47:00.560 --> 47:02.520
I'm going to go over to System76 real quick.

47:02.520 --> 47:03.080
Yeah.

47:03.080 --> 47:04.360
As you do, you know.

47:04.360 --> 47:06.240
I don't know what I'd ever use an ARM server for,

47:06.240 --> 47:07.560
but I wish I had a use for it.

47:07.560 --> 47:08.640
It just seems super cool.

47:08.640 --> 47:09.440
I guess a NAS.

47:09.440 --> 47:11.240
I could build a NAS out of an ARM server.

47:11.240 --> 47:12.840
Well, I'm going to hold out.

47:12.840 --> 47:15.320
I see a future one day where there

47:15.320 --> 47:20.200
is a laser-engraved System76 aluminum laptop with an ARM.

47:20.200 --> 47:21.540
I don't know why I care, actually.

47:21.540 --> 47:23.280
I think x86 is doing great.

47:23.280 --> 47:25.120
Long live x86, I say.

47:25.120 --> 47:28.600
Hey, long live x86.

47:28.600 --> 47:29.880
All right, a little housekeeping.

47:29.880 --> 47:33.240
Some big things to talk about, including some awards

47:33.240 --> 47:34.560
and whatnot coming down the pipe.

47:34.560 --> 47:35.160
Award shows.

47:35.160 --> 47:36.440
Did you know that the open source community

47:36.440 --> 47:37.160
has award shows?

47:37.160 --> 47:38.200
I did not.

47:38.200 --> 47:39.240
Not only does it have award shows,

47:39.240 --> 47:40.520
apparently it's had them for years.

47:40.520 --> 47:42.720
I probably even talked about them on the show before.

47:42.720 --> 47:44.360
God, what is the matter with me?

47:44.360 --> 47:47.360
Clearly, you place a very high value on awards.

47:47.360 --> 47:49.440
Yeah.

47:49.440 --> 47:52.360
I really, I really, yeah, OK.

47:52.360 --> 47:53.640
Anyways, but you know, some people do.

47:53.640 --> 47:55.120
Some people do, and it's totally fine.

47:55.120 --> 47:56.760
Are we going to have a viewing party here at the studio?

47:56.760 --> 47:57.500
That's what you're saying?

47:57.500 --> 47:58.000
Oh, yeah.

47:58.000 --> 47:58.560
You know what?

47:58.560 --> 48:00.160
If they live stream it, we should.

48:00.160 --> 48:01.000
I'll tell you what.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.400
If they live stream it, that would actually be pretty cool.

48:03.400 --> 48:05.640
But we do have a couple of big things to talk about.

48:05.640 --> 48:08.040
Wes just got done with an Ansible study group.

48:08.040 --> 48:09.400
Just did one before the show.

48:09.400 --> 48:10.120
Oh, yeah, yeah.

48:10.120 --> 48:11.480
With demos and all.

48:11.480 --> 48:15.400
And he and Elle went through the basics of Ansible,

48:15.400 --> 48:18.160
described a little about use cases of Ansible,

48:18.160 --> 48:19.880
and then you even gave a demonstration.

48:19.880 --> 48:21.040
A nice one, too.

48:21.040 --> 48:23.200
A nice, clear, easy to understand demonstration.

48:23.200 --> 48:24.440
A demo, if you will.

48:24.440 --> 48:25.500
And it's done now.

48:25.500 --> 48:27.000
The live stream has concluded, but we

48:27.000 --> 48:30.820
will release that video in the future on the YouTube channel.

48:30.820 --> 48:32.280
Something to look forward to.

48:32.280 --> 48:34.400
We'll have probably a link next week.

48:34.400 --> 48:35.740
In the meantime, if you missed it

48:35.740 --> 48:37.800
and you just prefer to take it, Elle

48:37.800 --> 48:40.680
has now released the Ansible Quick Start course for free,

48:40.680 --> 48:42.320
along with a bunch of other things,

48:42.320 --> 48:45.320
including using Ansible for configuration management

48:45.320 --> 48:48.480
and deployments, Google App Engine Deep Dive,

48:48.480 --> 48:50.560
DevSecOps Essentials.

48:50.560 --> 48:53.680
See, what's so dangerous here is you start with the Ansible

48:53.680 --> 48:56.120
Quick Start, and you get a whole bunch of servers set up.

48:56.120 --> 48:58.480
And then now, since you can configure them with Ansible,

48:58.480 --> 49:00.440
you take all the rest of that free content,

49:00.440 --> 49:02.680
and suddenly you're hooked on the cloud.

49:02.680 --> 49:03.920
I know, that's true, yeah.

49:03.920 --> 49:06.880
PowerShell Core for Linux admins.

49:06.880 --> 49:10.560
You know, I got to admit, I'm just a tiny bit curious.

49:10.560 --> 49:12.280
Like, I kind of am curious.

49:12.280 --> 49:14.200
So we have this community edition thing,

49:14.200 --> 49:16.400
and that's what Elle and I are in charge of.

49:16.400 --> 49:19.940
We release these courses every month.

49:19.940 --> 49:21.320
There's a whole bunch that are always free,

49:21.320 --> 49:23.640
and then there's new ones that get released every month.

49:23.640 --> 49:25.600
Some get turned back to paid only.

49:25.600 --> 49:27.480
But you can sign up for a community account

49:27.480 --> 49:28.560
and go try them out.

49:28.560 --> 49:29.240
It's pretty good.

49:29.240 --> 49:31.000
I'll have a signed-in link in the show notes

49:31.000 --> 49:31.760
for the Ansible ones.

49:31.760 --> 49:33.000
So if you're logged into the platform

49:33.000 --> 49:34.640
and want to go right to the course,

49:34.640 --> 49:35.640
I'll have a link in the show notes.

49:35.640 --> 49:35.680
That works great.

49:35.680 --> 49:36.320
Yeah.

49:36.320 --> 49:37.360
That'd be pretty cool.

49:37.360 --> 49:39.080
So I just want to let you know about that.

49:39.080 --> 49:41.520
So we'll have that posted up on the YouTube channel, Wes's

49:41.520 --> 49:43.040
study group soon.

49:43.040 --> 49:46.240
It'll be a little bit, because we got to encode it,

49:46.240 --> 49:47.360
and that takes a long time.

49:47.360 --> 49:48.880
Just a little post-processing.

49:48.880 --> 49:50.880
We got rid of all of our video computers,

49:50.880 --> 49:52.680
and then all of a sudden, we decided to do a video thing.

49:52.680 --> 49:54.560
So we got to go back into the garage.

49:54.560 --> 49:55.360
No, I'm kidding.

49:55.360 --> 49:56.160
I'm kidding.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.840
It'll just take a little bit.

49:57.840 --> 50:02.000
Now, we also do have these open source awards, the UK Open

50:02.000 --> 50:07.480
Source Awards 2019 in Edinburgh, June 12, 2019.

50:07.480 --> 50:10.800
70 days, 8 hours, 54 minutes, and 15 seconds

50:10.800 --> 50:12.200
from when we record.

50:12.200 --> 50:16.660
The awards event will be at a university,

50:16.660 --> 50:17.580
and you can go there.

50:17.580 --> 50:19.280
There's going to be, I think, a little drink

50:19.280 --> 50:20.800
section, a little show thing.

50:20.800 --> 50:24.640
It's kind of like a show and an event kind of thing.

50:24.640 --> 50:27.000
So there'll be booths and all that kind of stuff, I think,

50:27.000 --> 50:28.920
and as well as awards.

50:28.920 --> 50:32.520
And the nominations are still open as well in five categories

50:32.520 --> 50:35.240
for individuals and organizations

50:35.240 --> 50:38.400
who have, in the last year, shown exceptional initiative

50:38.400 --> 50:40.160
with free software and open source software.

50:40.160 --> 50:41.840
Well, obviously, Wes Payne, you should

50:41.840 --> 50:44.960
get the individual award, company award,

50:44.960 --> 50:46.480
and public sector award.

50:46.480 --> 50:47.840
Yeah, I'm all right with that.

50:47.840 --> 50:49.380
I assume that comes with a free ticket

50:49.380 --> 50:51.160
to the event, which sounds lovely.

50:51.160 --> 50:53.480
But really, there are so many projects

50:53.480 --> 50:55.720
that can fit that bill, so go out and nominate.

50:55.720 --> 50:57.160
Yeah, OK, maybe not.

50:57.160 --> 51:01.240
But I feel like, you know, maybe you could nominate.

51:01.240 --> 51:02.400
Somebody could go and nominate, Wes,

51:02.400 --> 51:04.000
because the nominations are still open, right?

51:04.000 --> 51:05.680
So somebody should nominate him for something.

51:05.680 --> 51:07.600
You saying I haven't done that for myself already?

51:07.600 --> 51:10.240
You know, we do have some stuff up on that GitHub repo.

51:10.240 --> 51:11.520
We do have some stuff.

51:11.520 --> 51:13.520
You know, cheese, while we're still in housekeeping,

51:13.520 --> 51:17.920
we ought to just, like, tease a little bit is the big look

51:17.920 --> 51:20.720
change that's coming, like, within days,

51:20.720 --> 51:22.640
within days as we record this.

51:22.640 --> 51:27.680
Yeah, we're nearing the first rollout phase.

51:27.680 --> 51:29.520
Which means we're, right now, in crunch time.

51:29.520 --> 51:31.200
Cheese, right now, is in crunch mode.

51:31.200 --> 51:33.920
Yeah, I'm working on stuff as we're in the show

51:33.920 --> 51:35.080
right now, actually.

51:35.080 --> 51:36.880
We've just strapped the microphone to his face.

51:36.880 --> 51:38.800
He's still designing with his hands, it's sad.

51:38.800 --> 51:41.640
You're podcasting and designing at the same time, huh?

51:41.640 --> 51:44.040
Well, there's so many, there's so many.

51:44.040 --> 51:45.200
I wish we had an account.

51:45.200 --> 51:48.240
We don't have time to count, but there's maybe

51:48.240 --> 51:49.640
1,000 art assets in total.

51:49.640 --> 51:51.440
Way more than I expected.

51:51.440 --> 51:53.440
There's a ton of stuff out there.

51:53.440 --> 51:57.240
Plus, you know, we're also getting the swag.

51:57.240 --> 51:59.240
Most of those orders have all been placed,

51:59.240 --> 52:01.240
so I think people are going to be happy with that.

52:01.240 --> 52:03.160
Yeah, Linux Fest Northwest way.

52:03.160 --> 52:05.360
You know, and I've had some people asking me, you know,

52:05.360 --> 52:08.700
if I show up or, you know, do I not get the stickers?

52:08.700 --> 52:10.720
Can I not get them?

52:10.720 --> 52:13.160
We do have some stuff in the works, some things in the work

52:13.160 --> 52:16.360
to make those items available to other individuals.

52:16.360 --> 52:19.440
Yeah, initially, they're just going to be at Linux Fest, but.

52:19.440 --> 52:20.680
Sort of a trial run here.

52:20.680 --> 52:23.200
Yeah, down the road, down the road.

52:23.200 --> 52:24.720
It should be available to more people.

52:24.720 --> 52:26.200
Yeah, that's going to be really cool.

52:26.200 --> 52:29.680
Also, along with all of that, we're probably doing too much.

52:29.680 --> 52:32.680
But it's so exciting to have our own designer now.

52:32.680 --> 52:33.160
It's amazing.

52:33.160 --> 52:34.120
She's just the best.

52:34.120 --> 52:36.040
We kind of went crazy.

52:36.040 --> 52:40.520
We also are working on revamping the website a little bit.

52:40.520 --> 52:42.880
Cleaning it up, trying to make it a little faster,

52:42.880 --> 52:44.000
updating the look.

52:44.000 --> 52:45.440
There will be a couple of features

52:45.440 --> 52:47.700
that get removed initially, and then we'll work them back

52:47.700 --> 52:49.260
in a new way.

52:49.260 --> 52:52.240
Stuff like that is coming soon to the website.

52:52.240 --> 52:53.320
It's definitely evolving.

52:53.320 --> 52:55.880
I think people are going to find it's a lot easier

52:55.880 --> 52:57.680
to identify the shows that they like

52:57.680 --> 52:59.760
and they want to listen to.

52:59.760 --> 53:02.400
I think it's going to be, you know,

53:02.400 --> 53:03.780
people have been asking for it.

53:03.780 --> 53:05.960
We've been listening.

53:05.960 --> 53:09.080
I'm here to try and help this all happen.

53:09.080 --> 53:10.440
We got a new look.

53:10.440 --> 53:13.520
The individual show pages will get updated as well

53:13.520 --> 53:14.960
with the new look.

53:14.960 --> 53:16.520
It's a full spectrum new look.

53:16.520 --> 53:18.880
We may start, just to get it right,

53:18.880 --> 53:20.680
we might roll it out in phases.

53:20.680 --> 53:23.080
So you might see it update in a few places,

53:23.080 --> 53:24.720
and then there'll still be some art assets out there

53:24.720 --> 53:25.480
that we haven't gotten to.

53:25.480 --> 53:27.280
And then in a couple of days, we'll get to those.

53:27.280 --> 53:29.400
In a couple of days after that, we'll get to the rest.

53:29.400 --> 53:31.480
But there's so many.

53:31.480 --> 53:33.160
Just today, I was logging into Twitch,

53:33.160 --> 53:35.240
and I'm like, oh yeah, right, Twitch.

53:35.240 --> 53:36.000
We got Twitch.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.880
We got a Twitch art thing we got to do.

53:37.880 --> 53:40.400
And Ustream's got a background for when we're not

53:40.400 --> 53:41.800
streaming that has to get updated.

53:41.800 --> 53:42.680
There's so much stuff.

53:42.680 --> 53:44.180
Because we're doing the network logo.

53:44.180 --> 53:45.160
We're doing everything.

53:45.160 --> 53:47.600
It's very, very exciting.

53:47.600 --> 53:50.160
And of course, nobody likes a logo change.

53:50.160 --> 53:51.360
So give it a little time.

53:51.360 --> 53:53.000
Let it sink in.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.800
I think everyone will find something to like.

53:54.800 --> 53:55.360
Yeah, I hope so.

53:55.360 --> 53:57.200
I think it'll make a lot of sense to people,

53:57.200 --> 54:00.280
the brand change for JB.

54:00.280 --> 54:03.320
And one of the best benefits of this job

54:03.320 --> 54:06.440
is that after I'm done grinding away on this stuff all day,

54:06.440 --> 54:08.800
I can actually go take Linux Academy courses.

54:08.800 --> 54:09.600
That's true.

54:09.600 --> 54:11.600
Yeah, you did that last night, you maniac.

54:11.600 --> 54:14.060
Another free one out there that I really recommend people check

54:14.060 --> 54:15.880
out is the one that Kenny did.

54:15.880 --> 54:19.080
And I think you mentioned it on a previous show, the Linux

54:19.080 --> 54:20.760
operating system fundamentals.

54:20.760 --> 54:23.400
I'm just starting from the very bottom,

54:23.400 --> 54:25.240
basically all of the community courses.

54:25.240 --> 54:26.920
And I'm going to work through that

54:26.920 --> 54:29.400
and hopefully be able to give you guys some feedback on those

54:29.400 --> 54:29.920
as well.

54:29.920 --> 54:31.040
Right on.

54:31.040 --> 54:33.580
Well, come say hi to Cheese, Wes, and myself,

54:33.580 --> 54:36.760
as well as Wimpy and many others at Linux Fest.

54:36.760 --> 54:38.520
And get the new swag items there.

54:38.520 --> 54:40.960
And then we'll get them up in other ways as well.

54:40.960 --> 54:44.000
But that's the housekeeping.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.120
Thank you, everybody.

54:45.120 --> 54:46.680
Now, let's get to some feedback.

54:46.680 --> 54:48.320
This is something that you hear thrown around

54:48.320 --> 54:49.280
in the community a lot.

54:49.280 --> 54:51.160
So I thought it'd be fun to read on the show.

54:51.160 --> 54:52.720
Sigflup writes, and he says, I find

54:52.720 --> 54:56.320
it's a common misconception that compiling programs

54:56.320 --> 54:58.400
makes them run faster than if you

54:58.400 --> 55:01.800
were to install the same program via a binary package.

55:01.800 --> 55:03.540
I personally don't think this is the case,

55:03.540 --> 55:05.240
because compiling something is often

55:05.240 --> 55:07.720
just a mirror of how the package was built

55:07.720 --> 55:11.800
and you produce the same binary for more or less.

55:11.800 --> 55:12.760
Do you think I'm wrong?

55:12.760 --> 55:13.880
Maybe try to change my mind.

55:13.880 --> 55:16.040
I'd like to hear a discussion about compiling things

55:16.040 --> 55:18.120
from source and its advantages.

55:18.120 --> 55:19.360
Thanks, Sigflup.

55:19.360 --> 55:20.120
So what do you say, Wes?

55:20.120 --> 55:21.640
Let's take a first stab at this.

55:21.640 --> 55:26.240
Is there a difference between pulling down a software package

55:26.240 --> 55:28.800
and building it yourself versus the binary package?

55:28.800 --> 55:31.240
I think it all depends on what options you use.

55:31.240 --> 55:34.160
So perhaps depending on your system,

55:34.160 --> 55:36.180
there may be some tunables that they can't

55:36.180 --> 55:37.260
apply in the general case.

55:37.260 --> 55:40.320
And you could have a little bit of a speed up.

55:40.320 --> 55:42.000
And in many cases, there are not.

55:42.000 --> 55:44.360
But I think, actually, yes, Mr. Martin Wimpress,

55:44.360 --> 55:47.320
who's been stuck over in linked library hell,

55:47.320 --> 55:49.160
probably has a lot of thoughts about this.

55:49.160 --> 55:53.440
Yeah, I think you're dead right that the performance

55:53.440 --> 55:57.760
optimizations that build from source distributions tout

55:57.760 --> 56:00.640
are usually because each of the architectures

56:00.640 --> 56:04.640
that you run those distros on have tuned compiler flags

56:04.640 --> 56:07.200
specifically for that architecture.

56:07.200 --> 56:11.680
And you can get, for clever use of each of the options,

56:11.680 --> 56:14.660
you can get a small gain in performance.

56:14.660 --> 56:17.640
But then by aggregation of small margins,

56:17.640 --> 56:21.820
you can get a measurable improvement in performance.

56:21.820 --> 56:25.000
And this is what something like Clear Linux does.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.080
It's a single architecture-focused distro.

56:28.080 --> 56:30.920
It's x86, 64-bit.

56:30.920 --> 56:34.580
So consequently, they can tune that specifically

56:34.580 --> 56:36.720
to Intel CPUs.

56:36.720 --> 56:40.640
And that's why it runs so well on that architecture.

56:40.640 --> 56:44.640
But when you're making a multi-architecture distro,

56:44.640 --> 56:47.240
then you have to be more conservative in the compiler

56:47.240 --> 56:51.740
directives that you set as defaults to make sure

56:51.740 --> 56:56.240
that stuff works reliably across all of your architectures.

56:56.240 --> 56:58.320
And the gains are modest.

56:58.320 --> 57:02.160
But certainly, the rises of Gen 2 past,

57:02.160 --> 57:04.360
it's not quite like it used to be anymore.

57:04.360 --> 57:09.320
And that's, hey, that's me.

57:09.320 --> 57:13.080
Yeah, when I ran Gen 2, it was really

57:13.080 --> 57:16.760
to get access to things that weren't quite mainstream

57:16.760 --> 57:19.960
yet that now every distro does.

57:19.960 --> 57:21.280
And it's not a big deal.

57:21.280 --> 57:25.160
And there's no reason that I needed to build it myself.

57:25.160 --> 57:27.640
But traditionally for me, I've always

57:27.640 --> 57:30.400
built software because I either needed a version that

57:30.400 --> 57:32.240
was newer than the distro shipped.

57:32.240 --> 57:33.440
Yeah, that's a good reason.

57:33.440 --> 57:35.400
Or it's the only way it's distributed.

57:35.400 --> 57:37.200
Or in the past, and when I say past,

57:37.200 --> 57:40.120
it's like the far distant past now.

57:40.120 --> 57:42.920
Because I needed something that maybe distributions

57:42.920 --> 57:45.160
weren't building by default. Maybe

57:45.160 --> 57:47.400
they weren't optimizing for that particular architecture.

57:47.400 --> 57:50.040
Because back then, people were still

57:50.040 --> 57:53.160
shipping packages that were compatible with i386.

57:53.160 --> 57:55.240
It was a long time ago.

57:55.240 --> 57:58.600
And it just seemed like problem solved as time moved on.

57:58.600 --> 58:00.920
That's been my biggest go-to.

58:00.920 --> 58:05.360
I think there's really no performance advantage inherently

58:05.360 --> 58:08.720
to just grabbing the same exact packages in your repo

58:08.720 --> 58:11.480
versus grabbing something off of GitHub and building it.

58:11.480 --> 58:15.600
If it's the same version, same features,

58:15.600 --> 58:17.280
even if you could come up with a few ways

58:17.280 --> 58:19.120
to optimize it in the build, they're

58:19.120 --> 58:22.540
probably imperceptible in the performance of the application.

58:22.540 --> 58:24.880
So there's really no point from a performance standpoint.

58:24.880 --> 58:26.120
Just save yourself the time.

58:26.120 --> 58:28.240
And don't build it if you don't need to.

58:28.240 --> 58:30.840
One other advantage, I'd say, is

58:30.840 --> 58:33.240
sometimes for whatever reason, there's

58:33.240 --> 58:35.280
some types of software that I like

58:35.280 --> 58:38.720
to have in a bin subfolder in my home directory.

58:38.720 --> 58:42.840
And I like to have just certain programs that are just there.

58:42.840 --> 58:44.920
My package manager isn't aware of them.

58:44.920 --> 58:47.560
It's not trying to update them.

58:47.560 --> 58:49.800
It's not reliant on libraries throughout my system.

58:49.800 --> 58:52.560
It's like it lives in this folder.

58:52.560 --> 58:54.920
And sometimes that might be a reason

58:54.920 --> 58:57.920
why I might build something from source if it's simple enough.

58:57.920 --> 58:58.200
Right.

58:58.200 --> 59:00.120
Yeah, you might want to have a whole separate little thing.

59:00.120 --> 59:03.120
Maybe not necessarily all the way into a container or cheroot,

59:03.120 --> 59:05.120
but just a separate little dependency chain.

59:05.120 --> 59:08.120
How often do you build things from source manually these days?

59:08.120 --> 59:10.480
So not like from the AUR or anything like that,

59:10.480 --> 59:11.520
where you actually think, right, here's

59:11.520 --> 59:13.320
a thing I need to go and download a tarball

59:13.320 --> 59:14.840
and compile it from source.

59:14.840 --> 59:16.800
The last thing I tried to build from source

59:16.800 --> 59:21.840
was but, B-U-T-T, the broadcast utility that does ice cast

59:21.840 --> 59:22.360
streams.

59:22.360 --> 59:23.840
Yeah, I think audio stuff ends up

59:23.840 --> 59:25.200
making us both do it a little bit more than otherwise.

59:25.200 --> 59:27.280
Yeah, didn't you just build something recently too?

59:27.280 --> 59:28.160
Yep, totally.

59:28.160 --> 59:31.440
Yeah, so there's some weird esoteric tools here and there.

59:31.440 --> 59:35.840
But otherwise, I would say since the invention of snaps.

59:35.840 --> 59:36.400
Yes, right.

59:36.400 --> 59:38.120
Yeah, I mean, not for distribution.

59:38.120 --> 59:40.400
It's just gotten a lot better, snaps, PPAs,

59:40.400 --> 59:42.360
people just shipping devs.

59:42.360 --> 59:43.940
Yeah, what about you, Whitby?

59:43.940 --> 59:45.480
I mean, it must be different for you.

59:45.480 --> 59:47.080
No, no.

59:47.080 --> 59:50.920
So I've just upgraded from 18.10 to 19.04 today.

59:50.920 --> 59:54.680
So the first thing I noticed is I only had one PPA on my system.

59:54.680 --> 59:56.760
So there was none of that nonsense

59:56.760 --> 59:58.280
to be dealing with post-install.

59:58.280 --> 01:00:01.600
And also, the PPA in question had a disco release,

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.040
and it automatically transitioned.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.480
I'm sorry, did you say?

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.720
Everybody's too much to take on.

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.880
Sorry, I had to.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:15.040
But I have got one bit of software

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.840
that I compiled from source on my system

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.240
right now that I had to rebuild post-upgrade,

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:25.180
and that is Green with Envy, which I love, by the way.

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:28.520
That is one of my favorite bits of software right now.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.960
It is brilliant.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.720
Remind me what Green with Envy does.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:35.520
For Windows users, this is MSI Afterburner

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.240
for NVIDIA GPUs for Linux.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:42.400
It's so good, and I've used this to really aggressively

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.240
overclock my 2080 Ti.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.520
It's amazing.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.880
And that's distributed as source right now?

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.360
Well, it's available as a flat pack.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.040
They're working on a snap, and it's available as source.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.000
But because I'd, you might remember some months ago,

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.960
talked about writing scripts to do

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.440
all of this overclocking stuff, I

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.960
wanted to poke around inside it.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.620
So I've been having a play, and there's

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:09.240
a feature I'm working on that I want to send back upstream.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.800
OK, Brent, so when's the last time you, or if ever,

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.320
have had to build software on Linux?

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.320
Would that be interesting?

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:17.920
Have you ever been forced to try to give it a go before?

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:18.560
Great question.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.520
So I actually used to do it a lot.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.960
Well, I say a lot compared to some of you.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:28.080
I used to do it sometimes, kind of the same reason as you,

01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:31.760
Chris, whenever I'd find some tool that I really

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.960
felt that I wanted to try but wasn't available,

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.160
either in the repo or something like that.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.760
I thought, wow, this is worth the effort

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:42.440
of jumping down a tunnel or a rabbit hole

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.080
that I don't completely understand to try to make it go.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.920
And I'd say 50% of the time I'd get it going.

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.560
50% of the time I wouldn't, but it'd be many, many hours.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.480
And I was like, ugh.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.080
You never know how that.configure is going to go.

01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:59.120
Yeah, these days I just sort of cringe whenever I see

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.160
I need to do that, and I just look away and try something

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:01.360
else.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.840
But I would say that for the tools

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.040
that I really need most of the time,

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.360
I never have to do it anymore, or even think about it.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:08.800
So we've come a long way.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:11.160
Yeah, I do the math.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:14.000
I'll be honest, I've probably just been like,

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.520
I've noped out now a few times.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.000
I've probably noped out a couple of times in the last year,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.440
but it's only been a couple of times.

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:22.240
I do think sometimes, at least audio stuff stands out,

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.640
but any time you have that thing,

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.040
it's kind of like a superpower.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:28.760
You perform the incantation, and then at the end,

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.600
the software worked.

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:30.840
Well, maybe.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.800
I think that's why people like to build their own kernels.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.880
That's like the ultimate.

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.600
Yeah, you get to customized options,

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.640
and it can be a good way to start learning stuff, right?

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.160
There is that.

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.680
But that's a pretty niche case.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.680
That's not, hmm, no.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.320
It's probably not, not really.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:49.520
Everybody could probably, if you don't do it very often,

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.120
why not try it?

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.440
Why not see it?

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.760
That's probably something we could do more of.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.920
We have such ubiquitous access to all of these great,

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.800
from complex to simple, open source applications,

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.800
and that's such an easy way to learn that we kind of just

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.320
avoid now.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.120
Even if you don't intend to use that as a way

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:09.320
to manage software, why not give it a go and just to learn it?

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:12.280
And our operating systems and the culture behind it

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:13.600
make it easy to do so, right?

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.980
You don't have to go set up some crazy Windows development

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:18.120
environment with proprietary compilers.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.600
It's all there in just a regular package way.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:22.640
I'll tell you, I went from kind of like,

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:25.280
I understood the concept of kernel modules

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.960
and proprietary modules that link to the kernel.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.000
I got that.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.640
But it's nothing like actually building your own kernel

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:35.400
where you're choosing which modules are build versus not

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:39.040
and truly understanding really how this works

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.160
and how you can have stuff just built into the kernel

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.000
because it's free software, so you can just build it right in.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.160
Going through the process of building your own kernel

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.080
and getting it to boot and creating an image out of it

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:51.920
and all of that and updating grub,

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.720
it's a very educational process.

01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.600
And there's so much documentation on how to do it

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:59.360
that it's probably worth doing in a controlled environment,

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:03.200
maybe like in a VM or on a spare system you don't need.

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.040
Yeah, that's the way to do it.

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.840
I used to do it on my main computer.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.480
It's like car maintenance, but where

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.800
you can afford a practice car.

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.400
Yeah, that's probably true.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.160
It probably is probably the same advice

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.800
you could give to maintaining your own vehicle.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.520
All right, well, you know what?

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.320
I think that's probably a good way to leave it right there.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.080
If you want to get your question into the show

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:26.760
and have us discuss it, go to linuxunplug.com slash contact

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:27.920
and send it in.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:28.480
Let us know.

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.360
We'd love to hear it and kick it around

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.120
on a future episode of The Unplugged Program.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.800
That's linuxunplug.com slash contact.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.720
You'll also find links to everything

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.920
we talked about today at slash 295

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.320
as well as in your podcast catcher.

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.960
And you can subscribe to future episodes of The Unplugged

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.760
Program on that page as well.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.200
We've got links all over that site.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.360
Everywhere.

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.440
Well, you know, I got to say, I really

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.080
enjoyed the last TechSnap.

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:52.920
Aw, thank you.

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.040
You guys, killing it.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:55.960
Killing it.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.720
Ways that people could attack you in the supply chain.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.320
Like, things I never even thought about.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.200
Basically everywhere.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.000
Yeah, it was a little hard to sleep that night.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.460
Yeah, don't listen if you're overly scared,

01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:07.960
but do go check it out, TechSnap.systems.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.880
Also, the Ubuntu podcast, rumor has it, may be returning soon.

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.400
Oh, boy.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.160
I don't know.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.520
I don't know, I would just make sure I'm

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.960
subscribed to the Ubuntu podcast right now.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.280
That's what I'm saying.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.080
I'd make sure you do that this week.

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:19.800
Yeah.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.480
Yeah, I'd just say that's a good idea.

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:23.140
Just make sure you're subscribed to Ubuntu podcast.

01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:24.640
Thank you for joining us, Wimpy.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.960
Now, thank you all for making it.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.240
We appreciate it very much.

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.760
I encourage you to join us live over jblive.tv.

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.120
We do it on a Tuesday.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.920
Go to jubilabroadcasting.com slash calendar

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.680
for your time zone.

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.320
See you then.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:06:04.280
And we'll see you next time.

01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:05.240
Next Tuesday!

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.520
I mean, I don't want to disappoint.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.060
All right, now we've got to pick our title, jbtitles.com.

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:15.100
Thank you, guys.

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:15.640
Great show.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:16.680
Really enjoyed chatting with everybody.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.400
Look at that huge Mumble Room still there.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.280
Amazing.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:21.400
You guys even stuck around for the whole show.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.600
And the post-show.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.560
So what should we call this thing?

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.760
jbtitles.com.

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.800
Everybody go vote.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:32.960
In the meantime, Mr. Bacon has a little community news

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.240
to share with the class.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.920
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.000
So let me jump back here.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.160
Mr. Lonnie Webb, one of our community members,

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:47.640
has a Kickstarter going right now called Killing Wryth One.

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:52.000
And I could drop that link in the IRC here shortly,

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.120
or we'll also put it in the show notes.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:59.000
Right now, basically, he's doing a comic.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.120
His goal is $750.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:03.800
He's at 59.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.980
He has 28 days to go.

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:08.460
So if we could go over there and give him some love,

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:09.800
I'm sure he'd appreciate it.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.720
And his stuff is actually really cool, man.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:12.240
I like it.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.440
It's the little image that he has, the video

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:18.000
that he has there.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.800
I don't know, it reminds me of just this Orwellian pre-cyberpunk

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:23.720
kind of look.

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:24.440
It's really cool.

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.360
I think everyone should go take a look at it.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.600
Is he using free software to make this comic?

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:31.760
He does not say.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.080
But I'm sure I could reach out to him and ask him.

01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.880
We're going to assume he does.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:36.960
Let's just pretend he does.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:40.600
I know that a lot of it is done, it

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:44.080
appears to be that he sketches a lot of it out first.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.280
So my guess is that he goes back in and inks it later.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.840
But I mean, I just love his style.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.360
I think it's super cool.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.320
I think a lot of people would enjoy it themselves.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:59.280
So take a look and give him a few bucks if you can.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.240
Boom.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:00.760
Nice.

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.400
Hopefully it works out.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.000
It's nice to see community members working

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.160
on stuff like that.

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.800
All right, we've got to pick this title,

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.840
and then we've got to go.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.300
Yeah, you thought your work was done

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.680
when you suggested a title?

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.080
Oh, no, my friends.

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.840
This is the hardest part, because there are some really

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.920
quality titles today.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.080
This is interesting to see YouTube getting a lot of crap

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.840
today.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.080
A piece over at Bloomberg, YouTube executives

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.880
ignored internal warnings from staff.

01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.840
Concerns that were brought up about toxic videos

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:31.800
were ignored, and proposals to change recommendations

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:36.560
were dismissed in favor of all-out chasing engagement.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.880
And they have documents as recently as 2017,

01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:45.880
it looks like, showing briefings to upper management

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:48.920
in the Alphabet Corporation about how they need to pursue

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.040
the engagement strategy.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.280
It's just not looking good for YouTube these days, is it?

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.000
No.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:54.640
Boy.

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:58.800
Meanwhile, today is the day to uninstall the Google Plus

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:01.240
app from your phone, because we are just hours away

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.760
from Google Plus being taken off the line.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.000
Right, I had a search result that had a Google Plus answer,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.120
and I clicked it, and I got a page that said,

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.600
Google Plus is going away.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:14.120
So I was like, well, remove it from the search result, Google.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.480
You're the one that gave me the link.

01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.520
Like, yeah, I'll take your stuff.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.040
Look, it's hard when you cancel that many products, you know?

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:20.680
I know.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.920
This is, it really is kind of hitting home right now,

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:27.280
that Inbox is going away, which was actually kind of nice.

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:30.880
I'll say, there was one bill I didn't know about that Inbox

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.160
gave me a push notification.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.320
It was like, hey, homes, you better pay this thing.

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.360
I was like, oh, my god.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:37.120
The robots are good at reading your email.

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:37.640
Yeah.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.160
So Inbox just got shut down.

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.400
Google Plus just got shut down.

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.880
Meanwhile, we have multiple ways to listen to music.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.760
You have YouTube Music and Google Play Music.

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.480
You've got multiple ways to do text chatting.

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.080
You've got multiple ways to do video calling.

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.880
Oh, Hangouts is ending later this year, too.

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:54.920
Yeah, it's weird what remains.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.800
And it's weird what they do decide to kill.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:02.280
And it is becoming part of their brand.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:04.600
They launch fast, and they kill fast.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.000
And so you don't know if Stadia is going to go away.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.840
And now you don't know about any of this kind of stuff.

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.800
Well, that's just dumb fresh meat entering the abattoir

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:13.640
right now, isn't it?

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.520
What, Stadia?

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.120
Yeah.

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:15.680
You think so?

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.760
You think it's never going to really stick?

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:18.920
No, I'm being facetious.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.600
I think this is one of those moon shoots that will probably

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:27.800
pay off, I think, when we looked back at how crazy the Chromium

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:32.000
Chromebooks were when they started that initiative.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.800
Everything wasn't aligned for that

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.800
to be successful at the time.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.840
And I think that Stadia, certainly the technologies

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.120
are not aligned right now for that to be a success.

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:46.720
But it will take somebody like Google to make it successful.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:50.520
And I've got mixed feelings about how successful I

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.840
want Stadia to be.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:52.680
Yeah.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:55.640
And I would imagine from a game developer standpoint,

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:58.720
I would really have to really think about,

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.560
how much development time do I want

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:03.920
to spend to customize my game for a platform that

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:08.160
is controlled by Google versus open platforms?

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:11.120
I guess they do that for consoles.

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.400
So I suppose you could look at it.

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.440
It's almost like another console.

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.280
But in this case, it could be.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.640
I mean, you already have a whole bunch of proprietary platforms

01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:20.560
to target.

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:21.400
It will be interesting to see what we have to take.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:22.560
But at least when you make a console,

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.440
it's out there for a while, right?

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.080
This, they can turn off any time.

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.480
But the flip side is, when the new console comes out,

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.760
you can't play the old games.

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.560
But with streaming, in theory, you

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.160
could play everything from DOS games

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:35.440
to the most recent crazy games.

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:36.160
Right.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.360
And what I'm looking forward to seeing

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.480
is those game studios in the past that

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:45.800
have been absolutely ardent, we're never doing Linux,

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:48.640
to see what their position on Stadia is going to be.

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:53.080
Because whether or not you get a desktop Linux

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:57.640
version of a game because you've targeted it at Stadia,

01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:58.720
that's a separate point.

01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:01.000
But you have to target Linux in order

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.320
for it to run within the Stadia infrastructure.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:08.640
So it will be fascinating to see whether anyone, Epic,

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:13.440
for example, changes their opinions about porting to Linux.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:17.440
And in a way, it only has to be somewhat successful, perhaps,

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.040
for that to happen.

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:22.080
Even because it's a whole retooling that has to happen

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.940
on the dev shops part.

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:27.400
So if Stadia is even semi-successful,

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.400
you may see shops begin to retool around Linux, which

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.240
could have long-term.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.520
Well, then they have some pretty good, like Real and Unity

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.800
both have or are getting support.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.040
And you could see others falling in line, which could

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.600
have good long-term ramifications.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.480
It's just so, it could go either way.

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:48.960
It's a fascinating story in that regard.
