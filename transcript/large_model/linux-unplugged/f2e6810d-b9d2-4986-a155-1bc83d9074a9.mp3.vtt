WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.680
What's new with Wimpy and Poppy these days?

00:01.680 --> 00:03.080
Working in the same room.

00:03.080 --> 00:03.920
Oh, really?

00:03.920 --> 00:06.800
Now, are you going to Wimpy's co-located space?

00:06.800 --> 00:07.800
Yes.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.400
It's bizarre.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.560
Very weird.

00:10.560 --> 00:11.600
Very weird place.

00:11.600 --> 00:12.720
Oh, really?

00:12.720 --> 00:14.200
This place has different themes, right?

00:14.200 --> 00:15.440
Yeah.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.760
We sat in the boat theme.

00:17.760 --> 00:21.200
So it was like a pirate ship with distressed wood

00:21.200 --> 00:24.840
and rigging and sails and stuff.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.240
It was very bizarre.

00:27.240 --> 00:30.040
But just across the way was Narnia.

00:30.040 --> 00:33.920
And there was an open space with sofas.

00:33.920 --> 00:35.720
And there were people sat there with their feet up,

00:35.720 --> 00:37.120
with their shoes off, just like they're

00:37.120 --> 00:39.920
lounging around at home on the sofa with a laptop.

00:39.920 --> 00:40.640
It's very chilled.

00:40.640 --> 00:41.360
I like it.

00:41.360 --> 00:42.280
That sounds really cool.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.400
I did see some pictures.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.680
And I thought that was, I think, that Wimpy posted.

00:45.680 --> 00:46.360
Yeah, it's nice.

00:46.360 --> 00:49.760
And it was lovely to have Alan there in person today.

00:49.760 --> 00:50.520
Oh, still.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.240
Oh, I bet you're doing it tomorrow.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.640
Gazing into your beautiful green eyes

00:54.640 --> 00:57.640
across the table of the pirate ship.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.080
When you take that out of context,

00:59.080 --> 01:00.160
it really makes no sense.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.760
That makes no sense at all.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.920
I'm going to speak to HR tomorrow.

01:04.920 --> 01:21.720
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 264 for August 28, 2018.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.560
Hi, everyone, and welcome to Linux Unplugged,

01:23.560 --> 01:26.120
Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly Linux talk show

01:26.120 --> 01:30.360
that this week is optimizing the market for Linux.

01:30.360 --> 01:31.760
I'm not quite sure, but we're going

01:31.760 --> 01:32.980
to figure out what that means.

01:32.980 --> 01:33.840
My name is Chris.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.160
My name is Wes.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.560
We'll be getting into the optimizing of markets

01:37.560 --> 01:40.480
and the new support coming to LVFS,

01:40.480 --> 01:44.000
as well as some big features that landed in Ubuntu Touch,

01:44.000 --> 01:47.240
some nice things coming to KDE, benchmarks

01:47.240 --> 01:49.960
that can't be benchmarked that then got benchmarked.

01:49.960 --> 01:52.720
And then we'll have the big discussion

01:52.720 --> 01:56.400
about what the heck Proton is, what Steam Play is,

01:56.400 --> 01:58.720
what CodeWeaver's involvement with all of that is,

01:58.720 --> 02:01.320
and what shift has actually just happened.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.320
So we'll get all of that into the show as well.

02:03.320 --> 02:04.720
It's going to be a packed episode,

02:04.720 --> 02:07.440
so perhaps there will be some optimizing for market in there.

02:07.440 --> 02:08.760
Well, we're yet to determine.

02:08.760 --> 02:11.240
And like every great episode of the Unplugged program,

02:11.240 --> 02:12.480
we've got that virtual log.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.280
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:14.280 --> 02:14.780
Hello.

02:14.780 --> 02:15.280
Hello.

02:15.280 --> 02:15.780
Thank you.

02:15.780 --> 02:16.640
Greetings.

02:16.640 --> 02:17.680
Hello.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.560
Brent is joining us via the Mumble Room today.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.400
So if you didn't hear his voice specifically,

02:21.400 --> 02:22.840
he is in there.

02:22.840 --> 02:25.160
Guys, it's great to be connected with all of you.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.360
And I'm looking at the news this week.

02:27.360 --> 02:29.360
And the thing I thought maybe we'd start with,

02:29.360 --> 02:31.140
because it didn't really fit with the rest of the theme,

02:31.140 --> 02:32.640
but I think it's a fascinating story,

02:32.640 --> 02:35.760
is this story from Fedora that looks

02:35.760 --> 02:37.880
like they've moved ahead with plans

02:37.880 --> 02:40.520
to start dropping packages that have essentially

02:40.520 --> 02:42.920
bad security practices.

02:42.920 --> 02:44.560
They're drawn a line, and they're

02:44.560 --> 02:46.720
saying this line no farther.

02:46.720 --> 02:50.520
And it appears to be aimed at removing packages

02:50.520 --> 02:52.280
from the Fedora package archive that

02:52.280 --> 02:54.880
have known security issues against them that are not

02:54.880 --> 02:57.080
getting addressed in a timely manner.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.680
Now, you might be thinking, doesn't that already happen?

02:59.680 --> 03:03.280
If it's a critical or important security issue,

03:03.280 --> 03:04.960
and it's currently open against a package,

03:04.960 --> 03:06.560
or a security issue of lower severity

03:06.560 --> 03:08.680
has been open for at least six months,

03:08.680 --> 03:10.240
four weeks before the branch point,

03:10.240 --> 03:13.360
a procedure similar to some longstanding trimming

03:13.360 --> 03:15.320
procedures will be called into effect,

03:15.320 --> 03:19.120
and the package will be removed from the distribution.

03:19.120 --> 03:24.120
Is Cinnamon an official spin of the Fedora project?

03:24.120 --> 03:24.840
I don't know.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.120
That's a good question.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.360
Well, you think this might apply to them?

03:28.360 --> 03:33.120
Well, I'm not one to cast stones, but yeah, totally could.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.120
Well, that's actually where I was going, is I

03:35.120 --> 03:38.880
was thinking of XFCE or other projects that perhaps just

03:38.880 --> 03:42.240
have this really torrentially long lead

03:42.240 --> 03:43.920
time between updates.

03:43.920 --> 03:45.920
They could get caught up in this, couldn't they?

03:45.920 --> 03:49.560
Well, technically, although they've

03:49.560 --> 03:52.880
been in a round of updating their code bases,

03:52.880 --> 03:56.160
so a lot of their stuff is moving to 4.13,

03:56.160 --> 03:58.160
and what isn't has had other updates.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.400
Yeah, them specifically.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.040
Yeah, XFCE specifically.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.640
No, I don't think so.

04:03.640 --> 04:08.560
I think they'll be fine, because what isn't already GTK3

04:08.560 --> 04:14.360
is built on top of GTK2 and its associated technologies

04:14.360 --> 04:15.680
and has stood the test of time.

04:15.680 --> 04:16.760
I think they'll be fine.

04:16.760 --> 04:19.480
It seems like, too, it probably matters

04:19.480 --> 04:21.480
what sort of application, because if you

04:21.480 --> 04:23.760
have to get to the critical or important level of security

04:23.760 --> 04:27.000
issue, there might be some low hanging fruit of minor security

04:27.000 --> 04:29.720
problems for some of our favorite desktop applications

04:29.720 --> 04:31.440
that haven't been updated in a while.

04:31.440 --> 04:34.640
That's much less of a big deal than an obvious flaw

04:34.640 --> 04:36.360
in something that's doing a lot of network

04:36.360 --> 04:38.840
traffic or functioning in a server aspect, right?

04:38.840 --> 04:41.320
So I can see why Fedora wants to make sure

04:41.320 --> 04:44.200
that people can trust stuff coming from their archives.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.720
If it's just an out of date program on your desktop,

04:46.720 --> 04:47.820
well, maybe I care less.

04:47.820 --> 04:50.240
I do feel like this is a big part of the end user being

04:50.240 --> 04:51.960
able to trust what's in that repo.

04:51.960 --> 04:55.480
That's what this is really about is increasing confidence

04:55.480 --> 04:56.920
there and improving security.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.480
And this seems like a pretty easy way

04:58.480 --> 05:00.920
to automate that process that doesn't require a human being

05:00.920 --> 05:03.720
to go through and flag a project and then run a stopwatch

05:03.720 --> 05:05.220
and then come back and check on it.

05:05.220 --> 05:07.160
Like this is something computers can be pretty good at.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.800
It's also good to have clear guidelines

05:08.800 --> 05:11.040
so that downstream projects can be like, well,

05:11.040 --> 05:12.000
why was I removed?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.880
Well, here's our clear policy.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.840
OK, well, speaking of things that are getting better,

05:16.840 --> 05:20.680
LLVFS is having a banner couple of months.

05:20.680 --> 05:24.280
This is becoming more and more irresistible of a project

05:24.280 --> 05:27.180
to be involved with if you are in the hardware business that

05:27.180 --> 05:28.960
sells to Linux users.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.160
Some people still are.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.400
But boy, is it getting harder.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.320
And Realtek couldn't say no.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.900
In fact, it looks like they may have been happy to say yes.

05:36.900 --> 05:40.040
Realtek engineers are adding USB 3.0 hub firmware support

05:40.040 --> 05:42.000
to FW-upd.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.920
A lot of these multi-function USB-C dongles that you see,

05:45.920 --> 05:49.840
like I've got one that's got ethernet and HDMI on it,

05:49.840 --> 05:52.160
as well as a couple of USB-A ports.

05:52.160 --> 05:55.760
And those are actually, in most cases,

05:55.760 --> 05:59.880
connected internally with USB themselves to each other,

05:59.880 --> 06:02.120
like another hub inside your hub.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.840
It's a bit of a hot mess.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.480
So there's different subcomponents

06:05.480 --> 06:06.920
that need to be updated.

06:06.920 --> 06:11.440
And that is what these, so the Realtek chips that

06:11.440 --> 06:14.040
are in there is what LVFS is getting support for.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.000
And they're working on getting also support

06:16.000 --> 06:20.120
to update the HDMI controllers that are Realtek as well.

06:20.120 --> 06:23.260
And in a nice turn of events, some

06:23.260 --> 06:25.680
of the hardware that's getting supported here hasn't even

06:25.680 --> 06:27.600
been released yet.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.760
So we're getting to the point with the project

06:29.760 --> 06:34.440
where, in some cases, vendors have at least enough awareness

06:34.440 --> 06:36.400
of this project, like Realtek did,

06:36.400 --> 06:39.440
to start working with them before the hardware is even out.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.800
And that's really great, because it means when you get

06:41.800 --> 06:44.240
the hardware, it's just going to work out of the box

06:44.240 --> 06:45.240
with your Linux machine.

06:45.240 --> 06:46.020
That's huge.

06:46.020 --> 06:49.920
Yeah, there's quite a lot of momentum around LVFS right now.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.600
And it's really great to see.

06:51.600 --> 06:55.240
It's at a tipping point, I think, and a good year ahead

06:55.240 --> 06:58.960
for the Linux desktop with LVFS.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.760
Yeah, the project really does seem to be picking up steam.

07:01.760 --> 07:05.280
And I wonder if maybe other vendors in the past

07:05.280 --> 07:07.400
have said it's not enough of a priority for us

07:07.400 --> 07:13.440
to fight with upstream ODM or to reinvent our internal process.

07:13.440 --> 07:17.400
Maybe now those decisions will be re-examined.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.160
I don't know.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.920
But we'll wait and see, I suppose.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.200
So the good news for the project,

07:21.200 --> 07:23.080
lots of really great hard work.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.320
And it's really good to see them just

07:25.320 --> 07:27.040
roll this kind of stuff out.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.400
And speaking of really hard work,

07:29.400 --> 07:33.680
the chaps over at Ubiports have been plugging away

07:33.680 --> 07:37.720
like machines and have just released OTA 4.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.400
And Marius joins us from the project

07:39.400 --> 07:40.840
to tell us a little bit about it.

07:40.840 --> 07:43.360
First of all, congratulations on the new release, Marius.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.200
And I noted that you say this is the official starting

07:46.200 --> 07:47.080
point of the project.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.440
That's sort of the messaging here.

07:48.440 --> 07:49.280
What does that mean?

07:49.280 --> 07:52.960
Well, it basically means this is where

07:52.960 --> 07:58.520
we have used the time to catch up and get to our LTS base

07:58.520 --> 08:01.640
and a still supported base.

08:01.640 --> 08:09.360
So now we are on 16.04 LTS base instead of the old vivid of 15.04

08:09.360 --> 08:11.080
as it was before.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.720
And that's what we mean with the starting point

08:13.720 --> 08:17.560
is that we have used so long to both build the infrastructure

08:17.560 --> 08:21.680
and build the build tools and build up a community.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.240
And now we are finally to a point

08:23.240 --> 08:26.600
where we can see everything is going smoothly

08:26.600 --> 08:27.840
in the development process.

08:27.840 --> 08:33.600
And we are at a point where we are on LTS, which is huge.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.400
Congratulations.

08:34.400 --> 08:37.680
And does it feel like it's fully yours now?

08:37.680 --> 08:39.880
Like this is a community project now.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.880
It's an independent thing.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.920
Yeah, I would say that.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.440
But it's still based on Ubuntu.

08:46.440 --> 08:50.080
So we are really, really tied with the Ubuntu ecosystem.

08:50.080 --> 08:55.080
And I really like that, being tied to a strong base.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.600
So I wouldn't say we're independent in that way.

08:57.600 --> 09:02.320
But we're independent in a way that we are doing something

09:02.320 --> 09:06.760
new, which is a community-based mobile operating

09:06.760 --> 09:10.480
system, which is purely community

09:10.480 --> 09:14.280
without any official backing or a company behind it.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.840
It's a project for the rest of us

09:16.840 --> 09:21.240
to perhaps one day have the option to put life into a device

09:21.240 --> 09:23.520
or replace the operating system on a device.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.280
And it's not tied to one individual manufacturer.

09:26.280 --> 09:30.200
It's not tied to one individual strategic partner.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.040
It's making a people's operating system for our mobile devices

09:33.040 --> 09:36.080
like they should be, like you can do with an x86 PC.

09:36.080 --> 09:39.200
And you make a good point that it's still totally based

09:39.200 --> 09:40.920
on that Ubuntu technology.

09:40.920 --> 09:44.680
But it does feel as its own independent organism now,

09:44.680 --> 09:47.280
like its own independent thing that, like you say,

09:47.280 --> 09:48.840
is doing something new.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.640
Speaking of new, I noticed in this new release

09:51.640 --> 09:54.800
there are some new power-saving features and also

09:54.800 --> 09:56.120
a new upgrade wizard.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.880
Let's start with the power-saving stuff.

09:57.880 --> 09:58.800
What's happening there?

09:58.800 --> 10:02.120
Is that savings that you see because of kernel updates?

10:02.120 --> 10:04.040
Are there other tweaks that have taken place?

10:04.040 --> 10:08.680
This is tweaks that we have done to utilize the wake logs

10:08.680 --> 10:12.880
or the Android wake logs, which is the power saving, which

10:12.880 --> 10:16.160
is kernel-based from Android.

10:16.160 --> 10:21.200
And since these kernel patches or these kernel APIs

10:21.200 --> 10:24.320
are really, really optimized for phones,

10:24.320 --> 10:28.680
it was a good idea to use those wake logs in an efficient way

10:28.680 --> 10:30.320
as it was designed to.

10:30.320 --> 10:32.120
So that's what we have done now.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.720
We used those wake logs properly.

10:35.720 --> 10:40.520
And we're really heavily based on the thing when the process

10:40.520 --> 10:43.040
or when the phone is not in use, we

10:43.040 --> 10:47.080
want to enable those wake logs so the processor goes down

10:47.080 --> 10:51.880
to sleep and just keeps one core intact.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.160
That is cool.

10:53.160 --> 10:54.920
And then there's that upgrade wizard,

10:54.920 --> 10:57.720
which I didn't see that one coming.

10:57.720 --> 10:59.160
But I guess it does make sense if you

10:59.160 --> 11:01.960
want to keep the same core install,

11:01.960 --> 11:03.040
you should be able to.

11:03.040 --> 11:03.520
Right.

11:03.520 --> 11:09.240
So we are currently on a rolling release type.

11:09.240 --> 11:12.080
And the problem with that that we saw

11:12.080 --> 11:17.240
is app compatibility or app ABI compatibility

11:17.240 --> 11:21.760
because some of the apps are compiled for Vivid.

11:21.760 --> 11:25.560
And when we update to Senior, we had the issue

11:25.560 --> 11:28.760
where the apps was not compatible because of New York

11:28.760 --> 11:32.040
Qt version, et cetera, et cetera.

11:32.040 --> 11:34.560
So what this wizard does is basically

11:34.560 --> 11:38.640
update all these apps for you once you have upgraded

11:38.640 --> 11:40.320
the system to a new base.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.320
This won't happen on every OTA.

11:42.320 --> 11:49.360
This is just for major, we call it framework change.

11:49.360 --> 11:53.160
So it's not something that comes up on every OTA.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.080
With the switch to a 16.04 base, what

11:56.080 --> 11:59.080
does that unlock in terms of things

11:59.080 --> 12:03.120
you want to achieve that you weren't able to do

12:03.120 --> 12:05.600
whilst you were based on 15.04?

12:05.600 --> 12:08.080
The major thing is definitely being

12:08.080 --> 12:12.080
able to get security patches upstream to still

12:12.080 --> 12:13.180
be on a supported base.

12:13.180 --> 12:16.320
I think that's one of the major thing.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.640
But there is other things like being

12:18.640 --> 12:21.280
able to run Andbox, which was not

12:21.280 --> 12:24.960
able to run on Vivid because of all the version of STL

12:24.960 --> 12:29.200
and all these libraries that they use,

12:29.200 --> 12:33.760
and also newer version of Mesa, a newer version of Mirror,

12:33.760 --> 12:38.280
and all these things that we want to upgrade at some point.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.760
We need a newer version of pretty much everything.

12:41.760 --> 12:46.280
And since Mirror is now targeted at Senior,

12:46.280 --> 12:49.440
we don't have to backport things to Vivid.

12:49.440 --> 12:53.160
The Mirror team will make sure it builds on Senior.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.320
Excellent, thank you.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.760
So let's shift to hardware for a second.

12:56.760 --> 13:00.640
I notice that things seem to be working pretty well on the OnePlus

13:00.640 --> 13:02.840
with maybe the exception of camera zoom.

13:02.840 --> 13:07.120
So are we getting pretty close to another fully supported

13:07.120 --> 13:09.560
hardware device?

13:09.560 --> 13:11.980
Both, yes.

13:11.980 --> 13:15.120
I would say this is the question that

13:15.120 --> 13:17.960
warned me about saying anything.

13:17.960 --> 13:23.840
So the thing with hardware is it's extremely hard.

13:23.840 --> 13:26.120
And we have to do some major changes

13:26.120 --> 13:29.960
to be able to support Haulium, since we

13:29.960 --> 13:36.600
are running many components that are non-standard in a way.

13:36.600 --> 13:43.440
And we want to be closer to the Haulium or slash Mirror

13:43.440 --> 13:44.760
in one way.

13:44.760 --> 13:49.000
And that's quite some components to change out.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.760
For example, the sensors and TPS.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.400
And that's also why we say this is the starting point,

13:54.400 --> 13:58.240
because now we can start doing all the cool things

13:58.240 --> 14:01.120
with Haulium, with the inbox, and all these features

14:01.120 --> 14:05.480
we want to implement, since we have a solid base to do it on

14:05.480 --> 14:09.800
and a solid base to start working on top of.

14:09.800 --> 14:14.200
So yeah, definitely more devices coming.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.760
I have two devices side by me that I

14:16.760 --> 14:21.840
have been porting nonstop after the OTA 4.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.240
Oh, yeah?

14:23.240 --> 14:24.040
Cool.

14:24.040 --> 14:25.240
No tease on what they are, though.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.280
You're just saying there's a couple there.

14:27.280 --> 14:30.240
I can say one of them has the import out.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.360
Oh, OK.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.520
Well, I'm looking forward to seeing where this goes.

14:34.520 --> 14:35.820
We'll have a link in the show notes

14:35.820 --> 14:38.680
where you can get involved, get more information, all of that.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.480
Just go to linuxunplug.com slash 264 to get over there,

14:41.480 --> 14:45.920
or ubports.com to go directly to the project's website.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.420
Well, thank you for joining us today.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.400
You're welcome to stick around as we go on.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.760
I wanted to cover this quick, just really just not really

14:53.760 --> 14:56.640
totally worth covering, but super quick update.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.680
Last week, we mentioned that Intel and Debian

14:58.680 --> 15:01.100
were getting into it over a new license change that

15:01.100 --> 15:05.000
was going to prevent benchmarks that used their microcode,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.160
which would be all executions on your system.

15:07.160 --> 15:11.680
And within about a few days after Linux Unplugged,

15:11.680 --> 15:13.600
there was a change in their policy.

15:13.600 --> 15:16.220
They removed that section and made it clear

15:16.220 --> 15:18.560
that you can still benchmark, which we kind of speculated

15:18.560 --> 15:19.080
would happen.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.880
But I just wanted to kind of close the loop.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.920
It's like so many things that we end up covering.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.400
It seems like, you know, there's lots of drama up front.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.240
And well, in the back room, the parties got it resolved.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.480
And now there's a sane part of the license,

15:30.480 --> 15:31.840
and it makes it much more clear.

15:31.840 --> 15:32.340
Yeah.

15:32.340 --> 15:33.960
By the time we're getting the news

15:33.960 --> 15:36.720
and people are starting to get their pitchforks,

15:36.720 --> 15:39.520
there's often already a response in the works.

15:39.520 --> 15:40.680
It's so true.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.880
Sometimes the hardest part of talking about something

15:42.880 --> 15:44.680
is not talking about it at all.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.720
How about a new feature?

15:46.720 --> 15:50.920
I bet Poppy saw this that's landing in Kmail soon.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.600
And it's very Gmail-esque, and I love it.

15:53.600 --> 15:54.320
It's really cool.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.360
It's called KDE Itinerary.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.800
And it's a couple of components, including one part that's

15:58.800 --> 16:00.440
called Prison, which is great.

16:00.440 --> 16:04.480
It's the part that takes care of barcode reading and rendering.

16:04.480 --> 16:05.920
And then there's also some support

16:05.920 --> 16:08.880
in there mixed in there for Apple Wallet pass files.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.520
I guess it turns out they're really nothing fancy.

16:11.520 --> 16:14.520
They're just a zip archive containing JSON data

16:14.520 --> 16:16.600
with some graphical assets for your logos.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.360
Hey, that's easy.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.520
No big deal, right?

16:18.520 --> 16:20.320
So they're like, well, we can read that.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.880
And they got that going.

16:22.880 --> 16:25.040
And so there's this Kmail plug-in

16:25.040 --> 16:28.120
that they've already got rendering, Apple Wallet pass

16:28.120 --> 16:32.500
file attachments, and flight itineraries in Kmail.

16:32.500 --> 16:35.600
So if you get an email confirming a flight,

16:35.600 --> 16:39.160
you get this Google-like rendering in Kmail

16:39.160 --> 16:41.640
now showing you your flight information.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.720
And you can click on it and add it to your calendar.

16:43.720 --> 16:45.680
Yeah, this is awesome.

16:45.680 --> 16:46.720
This is totally awesome.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.320
I heard about this at Academy.

16:48.320 --> 16:48.880
You saw this?

16:48.880 --> 16:50.760
Yeah, they were talking about it at Academy.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.760
And the whole goal of this is to be

16:53.760 --> 16:55.960
able to print out your boarding card

16:55.960 --> 16:58.160
or have your boarding card on your phone or your laptop

16:58.160 --> 17:02.720
or whatever without having some giant American company reading

17:02.720 --> 17:04.000
all your email, basically.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.240
You want to be able to be in control of your data.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.720
And the whole ethos that runs through a lot of KDE apps

17:09.720 --> 17:13.880
is privacy first, that user's privacy is respected.

17:13.880 --> 17:16.620
And they don't send your data off to third parties,

17:16.620 --> 17:18.520
but analyze your data locally.

17:18.520 --> 17:21.880
And they've worked hard to analyze these emails

17:21.880 --> 17:25.520
that you get from your travel partners or the data

17:25.520 --> 17:27.240
that you get from a travel booking

17:27.240 --> 17:31.460
to be able to render your ticket or your boarding card

17:31.460 --> 17:32.400
or whatever.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.040
And it's hard.

17:33.040 --> 17:34.740
It's a hard problem to solve because most

17:34.740 --> 17:37.080
of these other companies have solved it all on the server

17:37.080 --> 17:39.560
and they don't make anyone aware of what

17:39.560 --> 17:41.560
the format of this data is.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.200
So the KDE teams have worked hard.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.640
I say teams because a lot of people

17:45.640 --> 17:49.080
are involved in this in order to make it possible for you

17:49.080 --> 17:51.240
to board a plane using free software.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.960
Yeah, they're even working on a mobile end of it

17:53.960 --> 17:55.920
where you can pull it up on your mobile device

17:55.920 --> 17:57.560
and render it out so that way you

17:57.560 --> 18:01.280
don't have to hold K-mail up to the boarding scanner, which

18:01.280 --> 18:02.960
I really appreciate that.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.000
It does look really neat.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.920
And that concept you touched on there, they looked at this

18:06.920 --> 18:08.880
and said, well, right now this can

18:08.880 --> 18:11.360
be done by a few large US corporations.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.360
Wouldn't it be great if we could do this locally

18:13.360 --> 18:14.280
on your machine?

18:14.280 --> 18:16.840
I would love to see more of that, more of that.

18:16.840 --> 18:18.800
And it's one of those things where right now you

18:18.800 --> 18:21.480
have to rely on big corporations probably using

18:21.480 --> 18:24.160
a whole bunch of your data and big complicated machine

18:24.160 --> 18:26.380
learning models to try to parse this and make it nice.

18:26.380 --> 18:29.200
It felt very far away from anything open source.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.920
So to have something that seems so close to being workable

18:32.920 --> 18:34.600
right now, I'm impressed.

18:34.600 --> 18:35.840
Yeah, I'm curious.

18:35.840 --> 18:37.520
Wimpy, are you still a MailSpring user?

18:37.520 --> 18:39.400
Is this still what you're using for mail?

18:39.400 --> 18:41.680
Have you had issues with MailSpring on high DPI?

18:41.680 --> 18:43.480
I do use MailSpring.

18:43.480 --> 18:47.720
I use it predominantly for my home email,

18:47.720 --> 18:51.000
and I use it occasionally for my work email.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.920
And that's mostly because I use Wavebox for work,

18:54.920 --> 19:00.280
which sort of consolidates calendars and email and Slack

19:00.280 --> 19:03.560
and various other online collaboration tools

19:03.560 --> 19:05.120
all in one place.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.260
So when I'm working, I tend to use Wavebox.

19:07.260 --> 19:09.360
But I do love MailSpring.

19:09.360 --> 19:13.520
As soon as MailSpring grows deep calendar integration,

19:13.520 --> 19:16.900
then I'll be in there all day, every day.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.920
Yeah, I'm finding that I am hitting

19:18.920 --> 19:21.800
the edges of it in calendar regards

19:21.800 --> 19:26.120
and also in just the UI just keeps falling over on.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.040
I can't run it maximized on high DPI

19:28.040 --> 19:31.440
or else it won't render portions of the UI for me.

19:31.440 --> 19:35.040
So I'm not super thrilled with the state of native email

19:35.040 --> 19:36.440
clients on Linux.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.960
So I might look at this Wavebox, take a look at that.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.720
I assume it's like some sort of service.

19:40.720 --> 19:45.200
No, Wavebox is a wrapper for many.

19:45.200 --> 19:50.160
It used to be called WMail back in the day and has evolved.

19:50.160 --> 19:54.120
And it supports things like Gmail,

19:54.120 --> 19:55.920
well, in fact, the Google Suite.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.400
So when you had a Google account, it adds things

19:58.400 --> 20:01.600
like the calendar and Hangouts and Google+,

20:01.600 --> 20:03.760
and a whole bunch of different services

20:03.760 --> 20:06.480
under a collapsible menu.

20:06.480 --> 20:09.400
But it also supports things like different Slack accounts

20:09.400 --> 20:13.000
and Twitter and just a whole raft of stuff.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.680
And it's just a really elegant way.

20:14.680 --> 20:18.320
It's basically like Pidgin for the 21st century.

20:18.320 --> 20:19.600
Yeah, that's interesting.

20:19.600 --> 20:20.120
You're right.

20:20.120 --> 20:23.500
It's like it's a multi-service central.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.840
And I didn't used to have an appetite for that kind of thing.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.440
But now I do see the use case for it.

20:28.440 --> 20:33.160
And as luck, just sheer luck would have it,

20:33.160 --> 20:37.000
Wavebox is available as a snap.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.040
Who would have guessed?

20:38.040 --> 20:39.040
Who would have guessed it?

20:39.040 --> 20:41.720
It's not like the developer was an early adopter

20:41.720 --> 20:44.440
and has been behind the platform since the very beginning

20:44.440 --> 20:45.160
or anything.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.080
There you go.

20:46.080 --> 20:50.080
So Chris, I'm going to let you into a little secret.

20:50.080 --> 20:54.240
Sometimes I struggle with my grammar and use

20:54.240 --> 20:56.480
of the right words in written English.

20:56.480 --> 20:58.040
No.

20:58.040 --> 20:58.920
Yeah, it's true.

20:58.920 --> 21:01.320
And one of the facilities of Wavebox

21:01.320 --> 21:08.080
is it has sort of whitelisted a selection of Google Chrome

21:08.080 --> 21:13.440
extensions within Wavebox, one of which is Grammarly.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.520
So I now have Grammarly enabled.

21:16.520 --> 21:20.680
And I now have Grammarly persistent across all

21:20.680 --> 21:23.760
of the sessions that I manage in Wavebox

21:23.760 --> 21:27.840
through my single Grammarly instance.

21:27.840 --> 21:33.360
And it has reduced typos and screw ups in the written words

21:33.360 --> 21:34.360
significantly.

21:34.360 --> 21:37.000
So yeah, it's pretty fantastic.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.680
Wavebox is very elegantly.

21:38.680 --> 21:42.000
And it's not like every extension imaginable.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.040
It's just like the really useful stuff

21:44.040 --> 21:46.520
that optimizes your workflows.

21:46.520 --> 21:48.600
And then for an extension like that,

21:48.600 --> 21:50.680
I don't necessarily have to have it in the main browser.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.120
And I could just keep it in Wavebox.

21:52.120 --> 21:52.840
Exactly so.

21:52.840 --> 21:56.600
I'll be checking that out.

21:56.600 --> 22:00.240
Now, there was an article that ran over at linuxjournal.com

22:00.240 --> 22:01.320
by Sarim.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.400
And it was on the 24th of the last week.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.640
And Sarim wrote in here that the year of the Linux desktop

22:07.640 --> 22:10.360
has been a constant call to arms that's

22:10.360 --> 22:14.000
sunken into a joke way past its expiration date.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.120
That's a good line, Sarim.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.920
That's a good line right there.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.680
And so he goes on to make a pretty compelling case.

22:19.680 --> 22:23.040
He says, today, what we have is a distribution-centric model.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.320
Software is distributed by an OSV, which

22:25.320 --> 22:26.840
is an operating system vendor.

22:26.840 --> 22:28.760
And users get their software directly

22:28.760 --> 22:31.440
from there via whatever packaging mechanism

22:31.440 --> 22:33.040
that OSV supports.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.920
This model has evolved because in the early to mid-1990s,

22:35.920 --> 22:39.240
those OSVs extended to existed, I should say,

22:39.240 --> 22:42.840
to compile the kernel and user space into a cohesive product.

22:42.840 --> 22:46.080
He's essentially setting up the role of what the distro package

22:46.080 --> 22:47.440
maintainers had done.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.600
Packaging of applications was the next step

22:49.600 --> 22:51.120
as a convenience factor to save users

22:51.120 --> 22:53.080
from having to compile their own applications.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.400
Yep, I'd say that's pretty much the case.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.440
Ultimately, though, these operating system vendors,

22:57.440 --> 22:59.400
or OSVs, enjoyed being gatekeepers

22:59.400 --> 23:01.480
as part of keeping developers honest and fixing

23:01.480 --> 23:04.680
issues that were unique to their operating system.

23:04.680 --> 23:07.480
OSVs saw themselves as agents representing users

23:07.480 --> 23:09.520
to provide high-quality software.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.360
And there was a feeling that developers

23:11.360 --> 23:14.040
were not to be trusted, as, of course,

23:14.040 --> 23:16.040
nobody knows the state of their operating system

23:16.040 --> 23:18.080
better than they would.

23:18.080 --> 23:21.760
However, this model represented a number of challenges

23:21.760 --> 23:24.080
to both commercial and open source developers.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.840
For commercial developers, the problem

23:25.840 --> 23:27.840
became how to maximize their audience

23:27.840 --> 23:32.240
as the Linux market consisted of a number of major OSVs

23:32.240 --> 23:34.720
and an uncountable number of smaller niche distributions.

23:34.720 --> 23:36.040
Commercial application developers

23:36.040 --> 23:37.720
would have to develop multiple versions

23:37.720 --> 23:39.840
of their own application targeted

23:39.840 --> 23:42.440
at various distributions for fear of missing out

23:42.440 --> 23:43.960
on a subset of users.

23:43.960 --> 23:46.080
Over time, commercial application developers

23:46.080 --> 23:48.560
would settle on using Ubuntu or a compressed tar

23:48.560 --> 23:50.800
file hosted on their website.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.000
Now, he goes on to keep making the case here.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.600
And I'll leave it as an exercise to you

23:54.600 --> 23:55.880
to read the whole article.

23:55.880 --> 23:59.480
But he makes the case that the distrocentric model also

23:59.480 --> 24:00.840
makes it difficult for developers

24:00.840 --> 24:03.040
to have relationships with their users.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.480
There is no way to build a community around an application

24:05.480 --> 24:07.880
if users are getting their software from the distribution

24:07.880 --> 24:09.000
without any thought.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.480
He writes, this model, I believe,

24:10.480 --> 24:13.400
has reached its end of usefulness.

24:13.400 --> 24:16.040
In order to further scale the market for Linux applications,

24:16.040 --> 24:18.000
we need to move to a new model.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.120
Although we can never eliminate the distribution-centric model,

24:21.120 --> 24:23.880
nor should we, to reach scalability,

24:23.880 --> 24:28.640
we need to remove the OSV as the gatekeeper for application

24:28.640 --> 24:30.640
distribution and allow developers

24:30.640 --> 24:34.920
to control how they distribute their applications.

24:34.920 --> 24:39.360
This is a new iteration on a couple of conversations

24:39.360 --> 24:41.200
we've had semi-recently, Wes.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.400
Yeah, I mean, it absolutely is, right?

24:43.400 --> 24:45.160
This has been a continued trend.

24:45.160 --> 24:47.760
We've been driven to alternative OSVs,

24:47.760 --> 24:50.520
even by the facet of we just need the software we need,

24:50.520 --> 24:51.840
especially when you're, you know,

24:51.840 --> 24:54.400
it's one thing if you just want to have a free open source

24:54.400 --> 24:57.280
desktop that you use casually to check some emails.

24:57.280 --> 24:59.040
But once you're doing real work, you

24:59.040 --> 25:00.840
have a much closer relationship with the people

25:00.840 --> 25:03.240
providing the software that lets you do that work.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.360
And you don't need a bunch of middlemen in the way.

25:05.360 --> 25:06.840
And that's been a big problem.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.320
So it's interesting to see it being addressed in so many

25:09.320 --> 25:09.960
ways.

25:09.960 --> 25:11.560
Yeah, yeah, it is.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.800
Sometimes for business software, it's

25:13.800 --> 25:15.120
a one-to-one relationship.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.840
The vendor specifically creates software for the business,

25:17.840 --> 25:19.200
and you're getting it from them.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.680
You know, there's no distribution

25:20.680 --> 25:22.120
required to be in the middle.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.600
And so those typically just be distributed as tar files

25:24.600 --> 25:25.620
or something like that.

25:25.620 --> 25:28.960
And then as we've watched the growth of snaps and flat packs,

25:28.960 --> 25:31.680
the conversation has become more and more often, hey,

25:31.680 --> 25:32.840
we're watching a shift here.

25:32.840 --> 25:35.320
I think something we brought up just recently

25:35.320 --> 25:38.440
is these things, like self-updating flat packs

25:38.440 --> 25:41.200
and self-updating snaps, what that represents

25:41.200 --> 25:45.360
is software developers pushing new software

25:45.360 --> 25:48.400
to a store or a repo, which then gets pushed down

25:48.400 --> 25:49.880
to your machine.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.880
And that's not how it used to work.

25:51.880 --> 25:54.960
It used to work that a Debian maintainer would review a

25:54.960 --> 25:56.400
package and then submit it to the repo.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.280
And then when there was a new version of Debian

25:58.280 --> 26:00.080
that would get cut, the new versions of packages

26:00.080 --> 26:00.640
would get cut.

26:00.640 --> 26:03.240
Like, it was a way different process just even

26:03.240 --> 26:04.720
a couple of years ago.

26:04.720 --> 26:07.200
And there has been this huge shift

26:07.200 --> 26:09.880
with app images and all these other universal installers

26:09.880 --> 26:15.080
that we have just kind of sat back and watched and commented

26:15.080 --> 26:16.360
on now a little bit more.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.440
And I think that's in that context.

26:18.440 --> 26:22.160
That's why I'm pretty curious to see how,

26:22.160 --> 26:25.760
which I think is the first, Libre Application Summit goes.

26:25.760 --> 26:29.000
It's happening next week in Denver, September 6

26:29.000 --> 26:30.040
through the 9th.

26:30.040 --> 26:31.320
And it's hosted by Gnome.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.200
And it bills itself as an application summit

26:33.200 --> 26:35.880
that brings together application writers, distributions,

26:35.880 --> 26:38.880
toolkits, and OS plumbers to build an ecosystem that

26:38.880 --> 26:41.680
encourages building applications on free software operating

26:41.680 --> 26:42.520
systems.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.880
One of the nice things about the Libre Application Summit

26:44.880 --> 26:49.600
is Gnome has reached out to XSE.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.240
I think they tried to reach out to Solace.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.760
And there's going to be a bunch of folks from Plasma

26:53.760 --> 26:54.920
that are going to be there.

26:54.920 --> 26:56.200
So it's not just about GDK.

26:56.200 --> 26:57.680
It's not just about the Gnome desktop.

26:57.680 --> 27:03.600
But it's being grown to reach out to the community at large.

27:03.600 --> 27:07.680
Did they contact anyone from the Electron community?

27:07.680 --> 27:09.080
I was on a conference call today.

27:09.080 --> 27:11.720
And they're reaching out to a few folks from there as well.

27:11.720 --> 27:12.240
Oh, good.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.360
Fantastic.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.960
If they need help with that, can you connect us?

27:15.960 --> 27:18.680
Because I can help with that.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.200
Sure.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.440
Shoot me a telegram, and I'll get you connected.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.120
Right, will do.

27:22.120 --> 27:26.280
Because obviously, Electron on Linux sits on top of GDK,

27:26.280 --> 27:28.760
well, two or three, depending on which version of Electron

27:28.760 --> 27:29.600
you use.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.320
So there's obviously some overlap there.

27:32.320 --> 27:35.520
Might be a bit late in the day, but let's have a go.

27:35.520 --> 27:39.440
All right, so Poby, Wimpy, Wes, you and I,

27:39.440 --> 27:42.480
we've all been to plenty of conferences.

27:42.480 --> 27:44.840
What do you think of this one, about a conference?

27:44.840 --> 27:47.200
And I think we're familiar with the background and all that,

27:47.200 --> 27:51.080
like a conference to kind of get together and encourage

27:51.080 --> 27:54.440
application development on Linux.

27:54.440 --> 27:55.600
Where do we start with this?

27:55.600 --> 27:56.800
I'm curious to know your thoughts, Poby,

27:56.800 --> 27:57.960
because I think you and I learned about it

27:57.960 --> 28:00.040
at the same time on Twitter.

28:00.040 --> 28:01.080
Yeah.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.560
So I would love to have gone, actually.

28:03.560 --> 28:06.560
I really wanted to represent us, but it's

28:06.560 --> 28:09.480
a terrible weekend for people in the UK,

28:09.480 --> 28:11.440
because that's when kids start back at school.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.320
Plus, there's been a whole lot of other events.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.600
So I was actually super keen to go along,

28:15.600 --> 28:18.760
but it's in the wrong continent at the wrong time.

28:18.760 --> 28:21.000
I find it interesting that there's

28:21.000 --> 28:26.840
an event that talks about applications on Linux.

28:26.840 --> 28:30.000
I'm interested to know who the target audience for this is,

28:30.000 --> 28:34.840
whether it's the KDE people, the GTK people, the Electron

28:34.840 --> 28:38.320
people, and Qt and everyone else,

28:38.320 --> 28:40.160
and who they're going to be talking to.

28:40.160 --> 28:41.920
Are they going to be talking to each other and saying,

28:41.920 --> 28:43.360
yeah, we should get all this done,

28:43.360 --> 28:45.960
and what are the outcomes of this going to be?

28:45.960 --> 28:49.160
Or are they trying to pitch this to new developers,

28:49.160 --> 28:51.000
like students who are entering the market

28:51.000 --> 28:52.280
and just starting to develop?

28:52.280 --> 28:54.920
I'm keen to understand who that target is.

28:54.920 --> 28:56.880
And for me, it isn't completely clear who

28:56.880 --> 28:59.160
the target for this event is.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.280
Well, I think that's something that's growing.

29:01.280 --> 29:03.480
I think this is the third year or so

29:03.480 --> 29:05.080
of this particular conference.

29:05.080 --> 29:08.440
There is a couple of talks on making projects

29:08.440 --> 29:10.880
interesting for students.

29:10.880 --> 29:14.280
There's some talks being put on by KDE about how they do things.

29:14.280 --> 29:17.280
There's talks being put on by GNOME about how they do things.

29:17.280 --> 29:21.240
And someone I left out was Elementary OS.

29:21.240 --> 29:23.320
They've got a couple of folks that are coming.

29:23.320 --> 29:26.440
So I think the target audience is application developers

29:26.440 --> 29:30.560
as a whole, be it new developers, old developers.

29:30.560 --> 29:33.880
I think it's trying to set a precedent for development

29:33.880 --> 29:35.680
of applications moving forward.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.000
I would have loved to attended this event, and also Guadec

29:38.000 --> 29:41.280
as well, representing the Marte desktop.

29:41.280 --> 29:45.080
But as Alan has just explained, the timing

29:45.080 --> 29:48.400
doesn't work for me.

29:48.400 --> 29:51.320
And maybe next year, I'll be able to get involved.

29:51.320 --> 29:53.800
If there's anyone who is listening

29:53.800 --> 29:58.880
from the organizing committee, or who is going to be there,

29:58.880 --> 30:00.680
one of the things I learned recently

30:00.680 --> 30:04.840
was when I was at the Electron Maintainers Summit,

30:04.840 --> 30:08.760
an Electron being dependent on GTK2 traditionally,

30:08.760 --> 30:13.480
and more so GTK3 in the recent versions of Electron,

30:13.480 --> 30:17.840
they were shocked to learn at the ABI breakage that

30:17.840 --> 30:24.400
existed through GTK in recent years,

30:24.400 --> 30:26.760
and the fact that they had deliberately

30:26.760 --> 30:29.200
built against old versions of GTK,

30:29.200 --> 30:33.920
thinking they were going to bake in some kind of legacy

30:33.920 --> 30:37.240
forward compatibility, and then horrified

30:37.240 --> 30:40.160
to learn that it segfaults like a bastard,

30:40.160 --> 30:42.800
and it's a big fat mess.

30:42.800 --> 30:46.760
And we need to think beyond what are

30:46.760 --> 30:51.280
the traditional Linux application developers now.

30:51.280 --> 30:54.360
You can think what you like about Electron,

30:54.360 --> 30:57.760
and you can be wrong about that, and that's fine.

30:57.760 --> 31:00.280
But the majority of development that

31:00.280 --> 31:03.000
happens on the Linux desktop right now that

31:03.000 --> 31:05.360
is relevant to the world that we live in

31:05.360 --> 31:08.000
happens in the Electron sphere, and we

31:08.000 --> 31:11.400
need to invite those people into our world

31:11.400 --> 31:16.520
and educate them to the nuances of the way that we do things,

31:16.520 --> 31:19.680
and the peculiarities of our toolkits,

31:19.680 --> 31:23.520
and also seek their feedback on how

31:23.520 --> 31:27.680
we are going to accommodate enterprise class application

31:27.680 --> 31:29.960
developers on our platform.

31:29.960 --> 31:33.320
I also was really hoping to make it this year.

31:33.320 --> 31:35.880
It's a long shot for me because I will

31:35.880 --> 31:38.360
be traveling during that time, but I

31:38.360 --> 31:43.040
will be traveling home because I want to see the kids for school.

31:43.040 --> 31:47.960
So I'm really torn because it seems like an event

31:47.960 --> 31:49.520
that I really support, and that's

31:49.520 --> 31:50.840
why I want to give them some time here on the show

31:50.840 --> 31:51.840
to talk about it a little bit because I

31:51.840 --> 31:52.960
think the idea is good.

31:52.960 --> 31:56.520
How do we get different projects together all

31:56.520 --> 31:59.200
with the same goal of making Linux a better platform

31:59.200 --> 32:00.680
to develop applications for?

32:00.680 --> 32:03.000
Build a network of people that are interested in that

32:03.000 --> 32:05.240
and can provide support and fast feedback,

32:05.240 --> 32:08.600
and I'm excited to see what the second version of this

32:08.600 --> 32:10.680
looks like, if this can get off the ground,

32:10.680 --> 32:12.120
roll in really well.

32:12.120 --> 32:14.360
I'm sure the next one will be even better, more people,

32:14.360 --> 32:16.360
and probably we can tell a little bit more about what

32:16.360 --> 32:17.600
it's all going to be about.

32:17.600 --> 32:20.560
So Eric, the IT guy, if you end up getting to go,

32:20.560 --> 32:22.120
you'll be our reporter on the ground.

32:22.120 --> 32:23.840
You can report back and let us know, OK?

32:23.840 --> 32:26.160
I will definitely be there, and I'm checking up

32:26.160 --> 32:28.320
with one of the folks from System76

32:28.320 --> 32:29.920
offered me a place to sleep, which

32:29.920 --> 32:31.320
made it financially affordable.

32:31.320 --> 32:34.120
So I'll be making the drive next Wednesday morning.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.960
Oh, doing a road trip style.

32:35.960 --> 32:37.040
Good, good.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.320
That's how I like to do it too.

32:38.320 --> 32:39.680
I like to do it that way.

32:39.680 --> 32:40.600
All right, guys.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.400
Well, I think it's going to be a good show.

32:42.400 --> 32:44.440
I don't think I'm going to make it, but if you do make it

32:44.440 --> 32:46.880
and you want to join us too and share your experiences like

32:46.880 --> 32:48.840
Eric will, you are welcome to.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.440
We do this show live on Tuesdays.

32:50.440 --> 32:52.040
You can go to jblive.tv.

32:52.040 --> 32:54.200
Usually starts around 2 PM Pacific,

32:54.200 --> 32:56.440
but it's all converted at jupiterbroadcasting.com

32:56.440 --> 32:58.480
slash calendar to your local time.

32:58.480 --> 32:59.960
And you don't even have to hang out in the mobile.

32:59.960 --> 33:01.960
You can just come watch the show if you want.

33:01.960 --> 33:03.640
In fact, I would encourage you to join us next week

33:03.640 --> 33:05.920
because we have a really great show planned for next week

33:05.920 --> 33:08.680
with some special guests, and I think it'll be a good one.

33:08.680 --> 33:12.400
So join us live next week, jblive.tv on Tuesday.

33:12.400 --> 33:16.120
And if you make it to the Libre application summit,

33:16.120 --> 33:17.880
first of all, tell them to choose a different name

33:17.880 --> 33:20.920
than the last, and then let us know how it went.

33:20.920 --> 33:23.160
Now let's take a moment and thank a few of our sponsors.

33:23.160 --> 33:25.640
I want to get, after the sponsor block here,

33:25.640 --> 33:26.760
I want to get into Proton.

33:26.760 --> 33:28.920
I want to get into Steam Play, and I just want to leave

33:28.920 --> 33:30.960
as much room for it as we want.

33:30.960 --> 33:32.800
If it's a five-minute conversation,

33:32.800 --> 33:34.920
if it's a 55-minute conversation.

33:34.920 --> 33:36.320
I think there's a lot to get into.

33:36.320 --> 33:38.200
We've dug into some of the technicals here,

33:38.200 --> 33:40.400
done some testing, quote unquote, for you, you know,

33:40.400 --> 33:43.880
the hard work, but also I've been talking to people

33:43.880 --> 33:47.200
in the audience that, for some, it's the end of the world,

33:47.200 --> 33:50.200
and for some, it means they can now fundamentally

33:50.200 --> 33:53.040
switch to Linux, and I've gotten a couple of stories

33:53.040 --> 33:55.120
that have gotten me kind of hyped

33:55.120 --> 33:57.240
because I am at a point right now

33:57.240 --> 34:00.120
where Windows applications are just not a thing

34:00.120 --> 34:01.240
I need anymore.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.080
I'm not, you know, I'm not trying to be high and mighty.

34:03.080 --> 34:07.240
It's just I've spent years sort of systematically

34:07.240 --> 34:11.280
avoiding Windows, and so I really haven't built up

34:11.280 --> 34:13.520
a demand of applications that I need,

34:13.520 --> 34:16.360
and that even extends to games.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.560
If the game wasn't available for Linux, that's fine.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.160
I've got plenty of games to play.

34:21.240 --> 34:22.880
So it took me a little bit to get my head around

34:22.880 --> 34:24.600
why I should care about this.

34:24.600 --> 34:27.000
I mean, obviously I care because it's a lot of cool stuff

34:27.000 --> 34:28.520
happening for people that like to use Linux.

34:28.520 --> 34:32.240
That makes me care, but why should I personally

34:32.240 --> 34:33.920
get excited about this?

34:33.920 --> 34:35.680
And when I started hearing some people's stories

34:35.680 --> 34:37.520
and I started digging into what's happening here,

34:37.520 --> 34:39.840
I got excited, and I'm gonna share with you

34:39.840 --> 34:43.400
what I've learned, including I contacted the folks

34:43.400 --> 34:46.480
at CodeWeavers, and I got some official statements

34:46.480 --> 34:48.920
from them on what their involvement with all of this was.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.200
So we can clear up all of that.

34:50.200 --> 34:51.640
So let's start by thanking Ting.

34:51.640 --> 34:54.160
You can start by going to linux.ting.com.

34:54.160 --> 34:57.480
That's how you support the show and get $25 off a device,

34:57.480 --> 35:00.240
or if you bring a device, $25 in service credit.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.400
Your average Ting bill is just 23 bucks,

35:02.400 --> 35:04.760
so that $25 will pay for more than your first month.

35:04.760 --> 35:05.960
It really makes a difference,

35:05.960 --> 35:07.960
and that's because it's smarter than unlimited.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.240
You just pay for what you use.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.360
However much you talk, text, and data you use,

35:11.360 --> 35:12.280
that's what you pay.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.920
If you're visiting the state sometime, grab a Ting line.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.600
You can get a SIM card, pop it in a device

35:16.600 --> 35:18.560
that's compatible, check their BYOD page.

35:18.560 --> 35:21.280
They have CDMA and GSM, which means you've got

35:21.280 --> 35:22.480
a lot of options to choose from.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.440
There's no contract, so when you're ready to go

35:24.440 --> 35:28.120
after you've been visiting, you could disable it if you want.

35:28.120 --> 35:29.000
You could also just keep it.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.880
It's $6 a month for the line.

35:30.880 --> 35:34.800
I mean, it's $6 plus whatever Uncle Sam's gonna cut.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.200
And then your usage.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.320
So if you wanna just keep a Ting line, you can.

35:38.320 --> 35:39.760
It's pretty economical.

35:39.760 --> 35:41.480
They have a great control panel that lets you manage

35:41.480 --> 35:43.920
all of this and set up alerts and usage stuff,

35:43.920 --> 35:46.240
and also great customer service

35:46.240 --> 35:47.800
that's always ready to help you out.

35:47.800 --> 35:50.400
Devices you can buy directly or bring one.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.920
They have a great BYOD page,

35:51.920 --> 35:54.000
and the entire activation process can be done

35:54.000 --> 35:54.840
through their website.

35:54.840 --> 35:58.000
If you wanna do it at 1 a.m. while you just have

35:58.000 --> 36:00.160
a wild hair and you just don't feel like talking

36:00.160 --> 36:01.000
to another human being,

36:01.000 --> 36:03.760
well, that's how I activated my EVO, and it worked.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.000
I couldn't believe it.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
I assumed I'd have to call.

36:07.000 --> 36:12.000
I activated my EVO 4G Y Max edition over four years ago,

36:12.120 --> 36:15.720
popped that sucker in, and I got $25 in service credit.

36:15.720 --> 36:17.320
And when it paid for more than my first month,

36:17.320 --> 36:19.280
I've never, ever gone back.

36:19.280 --> 36:22.480
Canceled Verizon, moved my other phones over.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.320
It was great.

36:23.320 --> 36:25.960
I went from paying 120 before taxes,

36:25.960 --> 36:28.240
so it was more like 145 per month,

36:28.240 --> 36:31.160
to sometimes like maybe 45.

36:31.160 --> 36:34.040
It's just, it was a huge shift, huge shift.

36:34.040 --> 36:37.040
And I just, I'll never forget that experience,

36:37.040 --> 36:38.160
and you can try it out too

36:38.160 --> 36:40.680
by starting going to linux.ting.com.

36:40.680 --> 36:42.240
Now, DigitalOcean.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.480
Now, if you wanna make big podcasts,

36:44.480 --> 36:46.720
you wanna make big projects,

36:46.720 --> 36:49.480
you wanna look like you got a big data center,

36:49.480 --> 36:50.760
I don't know where I'm going with that really,

36:50.760 --> 36:52.280
other than to tell you DigitalOcean's how you do it.

36:52.280 --> 36:54.040
Do.co slash unplugged.

36:54.040 --> 36:55.880
I say that because within 55 seconds,

36:55.880 --> 36:58.000
you can have something on their enterprise grade SSL

36:58.000 --> 37:01.720
these 40 gigabit connections coming into their hypervisors,

37:01.720 --> 37:03.640
data centers all over the world.

37:03.640 --> 37:07.960
Like it's a legitimate setup and you have access to it

37:07.960 --> 37:10.880
and you can get it for a hundred dollars of credit

37:10.880 --> 37:12.600
and just try it out for like 60 days.

37:12.600 --> 37:16.040
And it's yours to like have as a data center infrastructure.

37:16.040 --> 37:17.360
You wrap your head around that concept.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.720
You can just go deploy systems when you want them now.

37:20.720 --> 37:21.840
And it's great.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.360
It's nothing like it used to be.

37:23.360 --> 37:24.920
You know, when I'd have to get a system set up,

37:24.920 --> 37:26.360
it would be a two week lead time

37:26.360 --> 37:28.080
before the vendor would even ship the parts.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.560
And then you got to put it in the rack

37:29.560 --> 37:30.680
and then you got to pay for power.

37:30.680 --> 37:32.320
You got to pay for internet and you know,

37:32.320 --> 37:34.560
T1 lines like a thousand bucks a month.

37:34.560 --> 37:38.400
And now for three cents an hour,

37:38.400 --> 37:41.520
I can have four gigs of RAM, two CPUs,

37:41.520 --> 37:43.840
80 gigabytes of enterprise grade SSD,

37:43.840 --> 37:45.600
three terabytes worth of transfer

37:45.600 --> 37:48.560
and a dashboard that is an industry leading dashboard.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.160
Like nobody does it like this.

37:50.160 --> 37:51.160
They set the bar.

37:52.040 --> 37:54.120
They're trusted by over a million developers

37:54.120 --> 37:57.120
and the pricing is straightforward and predictable.

37:57.120 --> 37:59.520
And when you go to do.co slash unplugged,

37:59.520 --> 38:01.080
you get a $100 credit.

38:01.080 --> 38:02.480
When you sign up with a new account,

38:02.480 --> 38:05.080
you can try them out, see what I've been talking about.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.240
Maybe go get off Dropbox and move over to Nextcloud.

38:07.240 --> 38:09.160
I'm just saying, you know,

38:09.160 --> 38:11.200
they've got some good infrastructure for that.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.600
I've been running the Nextcloud instance up there

38:12.600 --> 38:16.720
for about two years as like a hot test,

38:16.720 --> 38:18.200
you know, like a hot standby.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.040
It's great.

38:19.040 --> 38:19.880
It's great.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.240
I've recently attached 25 gigs worth of additional storage.

38:22.240 --> 38:23.080
Love it.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.560
It's just perfect.

38:24.560 --> 38:28.280
So go check it out, do.co slash unplugged and get started.

38:28.280 --> 38:31.560
And then last but absolutely not least,

38:31.560 --> 38:34.000
a big thank you to Linux Academy.

38:34.000 --> 38:37.120
I would tell you to go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged,

38:37.120 --> 38:38.440
but I'm actually say don't do that.

38:38.440 --> 38:41.080
I mean, do it, but don't do it until September 3rd

38:41.080 --> 38:44.680
because they're doing a huge sale.

38:44.680 --> 38:46.680
You can buy out the whole year for 299.

38:46.680 --> 38:48.600
Just be done for the year.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.560
299, you get access to everything.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.600
And that's a great deal.

38:52.600 --> 38:56.560
That's like phenomenal pricing.

38:56.560 --> 39:00.560
And the value you get from that is mind blowing.

39:00.560 --> 39:04.800
That is an, the books alone back in the day

39:04.800 --> 39:07.640
to take those courses would have been four or $500.

39:07.640 --> 39:09.800
Like I can't even with you right now with this.

39:09.800 --> 39:13.800
So go to Linux Academy, but wait until September 3rd

39:13.800 --> 39:16.160
because on September 3rd, Monday,

39:16.160 --> 39:18.960
they're starting a 299 a year sale.

39:18.960 --> 39:22.440
And I think that's the best deal that they've been doing ads

39:22.440 --> 39:24.600
on this network since 2014.

39:24.600 --> 39:28.040
And I think that's the best deal that we have ever seen.

39:28.040 --> 39:30.920
So go to Linux Academy, but just wait a couple of days

39:30.920 --> 39:32.200
and then sign up.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.080
It's a platform to learn about Linux,

39:34.080 --> 39:36.600
everything that Linux runs or runs on Linux,

39:36.600 --> 39:38.280
including the things that are really gonna make

39:38.280 --> 39:39.400
your resume look good.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.120
And it's stuff that's put together

39:41.120 --> 39:45.680
by full-time training architects who specialize in this stuff.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.120
Like they're from the field.

39:47.120 --> 39:48.920
And they're creating the courseware

39:48.920 --> 39:51.240
and they're answering your questions.

39:51.240 --> 39:53.080
And now they're doing a sale

39:53.080 --> 39:55.800
that is way beyond anything I've ever seen.

39:55.800 --> 39:59.840
So go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged on Monday

39:59.840 --> 40:04.280
and September 3rd, 2018, and look for that 299 a year sale.

40:04.280 --> 40:05.960
Dig around until you get it.

40:05.960 --> 40:07.920
That's the best tip I've had

40:07.920 --> 40:09.080
for Linux Academy for a long time.

40:09.080 --> 40:10.640
Plus they just launched all that new content.

40:10.640 --> 40:13.040
It's all in there, all the new, the labs,

40:13.040 --> 40:16.120
the interactive guides, like it's all in there.

40:16.120 --> 40:19.360
So it's a great deal, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

40:19.360 --> 40:21.000
And a big thank you to Linux Academy

40:21.000 --> 40:22.720
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.280
Thanks to all of our sponsors

40:24.280 --> 40:25.640
for sponsoring this here show.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.040
Okay, so there we go.

40:27.040 --> 40:28.880
Sponsor block is done.

40:28.880 --> 40:30.440
We've done our business for the day.

40:30.440 --> 40:32.240
Now we get to just play around.

40:32.240 --> 40:33.720
So let's talk about Steam Play.

40:33.720 --> 40:34.800
We can have fun.

40:34.800 --> 40:35.840
Oh, I was having fun.

40:35.840 --> 40:37.200
Let me tell you, I was having fun.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.640
But now, now this is a whole new kind of fun.

40:39.640 --> 40:41.000
This is like an emulated fun.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.880
But don't call it an emulator.

40:43.880 --> 40:46.480
All right, so let's talk about Steam Play,

40:46.480 --> 40:49.920
which we were speculating about on Linux Action News.

40:49.920 --> 40:52.920
And then it came out and boom, here we have it.

40:52.920 --> 40:58.240
And the core of Steam Play is really something called Proton.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.320
That's what's sitting underneath the Steam client

41:00.320 --> 41:02.480
is this Proton system.

41:02.480 --> 41:04.600
And I don't know, Wes, I'd say it's probably fair

41:04.600 --> 41:08.720
to describe Proton as something that's made up of many parts.

41:08.720 --> 41:10.960
Well, yeah, I think you're absolutely right about that.

41:10.960 --> 41:14.080
And there's lots of little bits keeping those parts together

41:14.080 --> 41:17.080
in a way that you, the happy, steamed end user,

41:17.080 --> 41:18.840
hopefully doesn't have to care about.

41:18.840 --> 41:21.520
Yeah, there's like the way they've built this thing,

41:21.520 --> 41:23.720
they being the people that have contributed to it,

41:23.720 --> 41:26.640
is like there's different shims in there

41:26.640 --> 41:28.760
for different types of Windows gaming technology.

41:28.760 --> 41:30.600
So there might be a shim in there specifically

41:30.600 --> 41:34.040
for DirectX 12, which is much more Vulkan-like at lower

41:34.040 --> 41:37.000
levels and requires less translation.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
And there's also shims in there for older versions

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
of DirectX, right?

41:41.000 --> 41:45.600
Yeah, there's older ones, DirectX 9, DirectX 11, of course.

41:45.600 --> 41:47.760
Plus, they've had to do some other work just

41:47.760 --> 41:50.200
to make things play nice, like better full screen support,

41:50.200 --> 41:51.040
game set support.

41:51.040 --> 41:53.480
And of course, they have their own things

41:53.480 --> 41:55.920
to integrate, like better things for Steamworks,

41:55.920 --> 41:59.000
targeting native APIs, better open VR support.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.680
There's just a lot in this one title.

42:01.680 --> 42:04.080
So Valve has posted Proton up on GitHub.

42:04.080 --> 42:06.480
And when you look through some of the issues that

42:06.480 --> 42:09.080
have been closed, there is a comment in there

42:09.080 --> 42:11.080
who's a collaborator on the project who's

42:11.080 --> 42:12.440
a CodeWeavers employee.

42:12.440 --> 42:13.720
And I believe his name is Eric.

42:13.720 --> 42:16.360
And he writes, we've been working on Proton

42:16.360 --> 42:17.320
for a long time.

42:17.320 --> 42:19.880
We've needed an internal code name for it.

42:19.880 --> 42:22.600
And we couldn't really tip our hat if it leaked.

42:22.600 --> 42:25.800
So we had to decide how the heck are we going to name Proton?

42:25.800 --> 42:27.960
What do we refer to it as?

42:27.960 --> 42:30.040
He says, we didn't want it to be something

42:30.040 --> 42:32.840
that we'd be embarrassed after using it after release.

42:32.840 --> 42:35.080
So no badger, badger, badger.

42:35.080 --> 42:37.840
And a bunch of ideas that were kicked around the CodeWeavers

42:37.840 --> 42:39.200
office one afternoon.

42:39.200 --> 42:41.440
And it ended up we picked Proton because it's

42:41.440 --> 42:43.240
short, easy to remember, sounds cool,

42:43.240 --> 42:44.760
and it's hard to Google for.

42:44.760 --> 42:47.240
So I was like, interesting.

42:47.240 --> 42:49.200
What did CodeWeavers have to do with this?

42:49.200 --> 42:50.440
Because I've heard about Valve.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.320
I've heard about Valve financing developers.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.320
I've heard about Valve's investment in Linux gaming.

42:54.320 --> 42:55.520
I've heard about SteamOS.

42:55.520 --> 42:57.920
But what did CodeWeavers have to do with this?

42:57.920 --> 43:00.080
CodeWeavers are the folks that make crossover office

43:00.080 --> 43:04.000
for Linux and Mac that lets you run lots of applications.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.480
Including games.

43:05.480 --> 43:08.040
And Jeremy White, their CEO, blogged

43:08.040 --> 43:09.560
the day of the announcement that they've

43:09.560 --> 43:15.080
been working directly with Valve for two years on this effort.

43:15.080 --> 43:17.760
And that got my interest, but it wasn't good enough.

43:17.760 --> 43:21.080
I said to myself, that doesn't make any sense.

43:21.080 --> 43:24.240
Because Valve is technically a competitor in some ways.

43:24.240 --> 43:29.160
Like this makes there be less demand for crossover office.

43:29.160 --> 43:31.880
Because a huge part of it is making Windows games work

43:31.880 --> 43:33.440
that don't normally work very easily.

43:33.440 --> 43:35.400
They don't normally work very easily under Wine.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.880
So I emailed crossover and I said, guys,

43:37.880 --> 43:39.120
could you clear this up for me?

43:39.120 --> 43:41.560
Because it sounds like from what I'm reading,

43:41.560 --> 43:44.640
I'm getting vague implications that CodeWeavers was fairly

43:44.640 --> 43:47.080
involved with Proton.

43:47.080 --> 43:48.480
And it's true.

43:48.480 --> 43:51.120
I asked, did you have dedicated staff to work on Proton?

43:51.120 --> 43:53.840
And they write, yes, we did have dedicated staff.

43:53.840 --> 43:57.440
Was a large portion of the code to Proton

43:57.440 --> 43:59.120
contributed by CodeWeavers?

43:59.120 --> 44:02.120
And they say that we contributed to Wine for this project

44:02.120 --> 44:05.040
and we contributed a great deal of the Proton glue code.

44:05.040 --> 44:07.080
There's a lot of other folks who contributed as well.

44:07.080 --> 44:09.080
And we've been amazed by the amount of energy

44:09.080 --> 44:11.920
that Valve continues to bring into this.

44:11.920 --> 44:15.080
I asked if this was actually started in-house at CodeWeavers.

44:15.080 --> 44:18.800
And the answer I got there was, we

44:18.800 --> 44:22.280
have worked with Valve on this from the beginning.

44:22.280 --> 44:26.920
In other words, to me, that sounds like Valve contacted

44:26.920 --> 44:28.880
them and said, here's something we want to do.

44:28.880 --> 44:30.800
And we think you're the folks to hire to do it.

44:30.800 --> 44:32.600
Because that is something that CodeWeavers

44:32.600 --> 44:34.360
has done before for other folks.

44:34.360 --> 44:37.000
We have worked with Valve on this from the beginning.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.920
To me, sounds like someone from Valve

44:39.920 --> 44:42.080
reached out to them from the very, very beginning

44:42.080 --> 44:44.720
of the project and said, we want to make changes to Wine.

44:44.720 --> 44:46.600
And we want to work with you to do it.

44:46.600 --> 44:50.360
I asked if it was always intended to be used by Valve

44:50.360 --> 44:53.520
or if they started it as an internal project to use it.

44:53.520 --> 44:56.480
And they say their sole intention

44:56.480 --> 44:59.200
was working with Valve to create this for them.

44:59.200 --> 45:01.000
The last follow-up question that I asked

45:01.000 --> 45:03.400
was if we would see some of these improvements

45:03.400 --> 45:06.920
make it into upstream Wine and Crossover Office.

45:06.920 --> 45:09.120
And they said, yes, absolutely.

45:09.120 --> 45:11.200
The Crossover Linux product will contain

45:11.200 --> 45:13.720
all of the Wine goodness that we have contributed upstream.

45:13.720 --> 45:16.600
The Proton bits aren't really necessary for that,

45:16.600 --> 45:19.280
as generally, our product already

45:19.280 --> 45:20.920
has all of the Glue bits that we already

45:20.920 --> 45:22.920
need, like picking the different DirectX levels

45:22.920 --> 45:25.520
and setting up the Wine bottles.

45:25.520 --> 45:28.320
But they are exploring using DXVK.

45:28.320 --> 45:30.520
But it gets tricky, as they also consider

45:30.520 --> 45:33.800
the macOS a part of their customer base.

45:33.800 --> 45:36.040
And it's a different set of applications requirements.

45:36.040 --> 45:37.800
But it does sound like CodeWeavers,

45:37.800 --> 45:40.000
from the very, very beginning of this effort,

45:40.000 --> 45:43.400
was involved and was working with Valve to build this thing

45:43.400 --> 45:46.000
and then contribute those improvements upstream to Wine.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.460
I mean, that kind of makes sense.

45:47.460 --> 45:50.760
We'd seen some movement on the Direct3D12 implementation,

45:50.760 --> 45:53.080
VKD3D.

45:53.080 --> 45:54.880
I think a lot of people have been kind of like, well,

45:54.880 --> 45:55.880
where's this coming from?

45:55.880 --> 45:56.880
Who's funding this?

45:56.880 --> 45:58.280
Why is this a Wine project?

45:58.280 --> 46:01.680
I mean, it made sense that it would fall under that umbrella.

46:01.680 --> 46:04.520
But that's a big undertaking to come out of nowhere.

46:04.520 --> 46:06.640
So I'm sure, knowing that they had the support

46:06.640 --> 46:09.520
that this bigger, hidden undertaking was happening,

46:09.520 --> 46:11.920
that's a lot of confidence, a lot of runway

46:11.920 --> 46:14.120
to build something that takes a long time to get a usable

46:14.120 --> 46:16.040
product.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.400
I feel like they valved up the announcement a little bit.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.860
Sort of a typical thing, it's a pretty solid announcement.

46:20.860 --> 46:23.600
But they managed to do something small that just really

46:23.600 --> 46:25.800
sets the impression.

46:25.800 --> 46:32.080
And they had this initial list of like 15 supported games.

46:32.080 --> 46:36.120
And two or three, four of them are like modern, this year

46:36.120 --> 46:37.240
games.

46:37.240 --> 46:41.040
And the rest are all like old games that nobody cares about,

46:41.040 --> 46:44.000
that nobody is trying to run on Linux.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.120
Stuff that came out years ago, years ago.

46:47.120 --> 46:49.760
And it just reinforces this impression

46:49.760 --> 46:53.080
that you can't get all these games on Linux.

46:53.080 --> 46:57.320
It was this really odd list of games that I felt like

46:57.320 --> 46:59.180
was actually more harmful than good.

46:59.180 --> 47:02.040
Because when you look at the actual list

47:02.040 --> 47:05.720
that the community is maintaining of games that work,

47:05.720 --> 47:07.840
it's astronomically large.

47:07.840 --> 47:09.380
I'll have some links in the show notes.

47:09.380 --> 47:10.880
It is huge.

47:10.880 --> 47:13.080
There are so many well-supported games.

47:13.080 --> 47:15.800
And I'll tell you, when it clicked for me

47:15.800 --> 47:18.600
was when I realized I could play Age of Empires 2 again.

47:18.600 --> 47:21.020
That is, I swear to God, Microsoft is never

47:21.020 --> 47:22.400
going to release that game.

47:22.400 --> 47:25.160
They'll never update Age of Empires 2 or 3 for Linux.

47:25.160 --> 47:26.720
I'm just SOL.

47:26.720 --> 47:28.880
But now with this and the community list

47:28.880 --> 47:31.200
where they tell you what tweaks to make,

47:31.200 --> 47:33.240
I can play those old games again.

47:33.240 --> 47:35.340
And it's pretty exciting.

47:35.340 --> 47:39.280
It represents a significant shift of availability again.

47:39.280 --> 47:41.360
Now, it's not a perfect solution.

47:41.360 --> 47:42.640
Not everything works.

47:42.640 --> 47:45.560
And sometimes you've got to implement some workarounds.

47:45.560 --> 47:47.600
But we just probably got another 1,000 games

47:47.600 --> 47:48.560
that work on Linux.

47:48.560 --> 47:50.400
And some of them are AAA titles.

47:50.400 --> 47:53.480
So with that all said, I feel like I

47:53.480 --> 47:57.140
must defer to the elite gamer of the group, Mr. Martin Wimpress,

47:57.140 --> 47:59.280
and get your impressions on this news.

47:59.280 --> 48:03.360
Well, it's humbling to know that you recognize

48:03.360 --> 48:05.200
my status in this discussion.

48:07.840 --> 48:12.680
Yeah, we talk about this on a recent Ubuntu podcast.

48:12.680 --> 48:17.440
And my take is that I've never, until Steam came to Linux,

48:17.440 --> 48:20.760
I was never a gamer on Linux.

48:20.760 --> 48:23.960
I used consoles as the means by which to consume games.

48:23.960 --> 48:25.800
And as soon as Steam arrived for Linux,

48:25.800 --> 48:28.840
then I was able to game on a platform

48:28.840 --> 48:30.880
that I really believed in.

48:30.880 --> 48:38.480
And this just extends the corpus of gaming catalog

48:38.480 --> 48:41.720
that I have access to now.

48:41.720 --> 48:44.880
And in particular, there's a particular genre of games

48:44.880 --> 48:47.960
that I enjoy most, which is racing games.

48:47.960 --> 48:51.080
And I've installed dozens, in fact,

48:51.080 --> 48:56.120
purchased and installed dozens of these Windows titles

48:56.120 --> 49:02.440
on the new Steam client beta, and had a wonderful time

49:02.440 --> 49:06.400
revisiting some classic racing games

49:06.400 --> 49:09.320
that I've not played for years, and also some new games

49:09.320 --> 49:13.120
that I really wanted to play but didn't have access to.

49:13.120 --> 49:14.800
And I'm now able to.

49:14.800 --> 49:19.320
And I'm sure there are going to be rough edges along the way.

49:19.320 --> 49:21.920
But I think this is a net positive for us.

49:21.920 --> 49:26.400
If you make publishers' lives easy,

49:26.400 --> 49:29.200
that they can see the number of people that

49:29.200 --> 49:33.560
are playing their published titles on Linux

49:33.560 --> 49:38.320
and not experiencing issues outside of what they know

49:38.320 --> 49:42.980
to be the bugs that exist in their existing Windows

49:42.980 --> 49:45.720
platform compatibility, then they're

49:45.720 --> 49:50.280
going to get behind this because it's an almost zero effort

49:50.280 --> 49:51.020
activity.

49:51.020 --> 49:55.880
So yeah, I realize that some people will see Proton

49:55.880 --> 49:59.560
as the electron for gaming on Linux,

49:59.560 --> 50:01.600
and it will be the demon seed, and it

50:01.600 --> 50:05.600
will be berated and chastised in all the usual corners

50:05.600 --> 50:08.920
of the internet that those opinions are expressed.

50:08.920 --> 50:13.120
But for me, this is a positive step forward,

50:13.120 --> 50:15.240
and I'll be really interested to see

50:15.240 --> 50:18.680
how it develops over the next six to nine months

50:18.680 --> 50:21.800
and what other pieces of the Valve jigsaw puzzle

50:21.800 --> 50:23.480
fall into place behind it.

50:23.480 --> 50:25.880
Yeah, this is one of the more interesting pieces.

50:25.880 --> 50:27.680
This is the central piece, right?

50:27.680 --> 50:31.960
This is the pivotal piece to whatever Valve's strategy may

50:31.960 --> 50:36.520
have been at the outset and the various faltering starts.

50:36.520 --> 50:40.200
I think this could be the piece that really propels things

50:40.200 --> 50:40.900
forward.

50:40.900 --> 50:42.640
And it sounds like we get a timeline.

50:42.640 --> 50:44.720
CodeWeavers gives us a two-year timeline.

50:44.720 --> 50:45.560
Yeah.

50:45.560 --> 50:46.560
Well, let's see.

50:46.560 --> 50:49.600
I mean, there's certainly been, obviously, over the last week.

50:49.600 --> 50:51.320
No, I mean, they've been working on it for two years.

50:51.320 --> 50:52.720
It sounds like CodeWeavers may have

50:52.720 --> 50:55.000
been contracted for two years to work on this.

50:55.000 --> 50:58.440
Without realizing it, some of the fun and games

50:58.440 --> 51:00.200
that Poppy and I've had recently,

51:00.200 --> 51:04.440
publishing Windows games inside Snaps,

51:04.440 --> 51:06.400
builds on this very technology.

51:06.400 --> 51:10.040
We just didn't realize we were doing that until these

51:10.040 --> 51:11.900
announcements last week.

51:11.900 --> 51:16.360
So it's already a net positive for the Linux environment.

51:16.360 --> 51:19.880
This is compatibility and funded development

51:19.880 --> 51:26.080
around things that we already have a good productivity

51:26.080 --> 51:28.080
story on the Linux desktop.

51:28.080 --> 51:31.640
We already have an excellent developer story

51:31.640 --> 51:33.000
on the Linux desktop.

51:33.000 --> 51:36.760
And the conversation always comes around to games eventually.

51:36.760 --> 51:40.000
And we've had an OK to good story there.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.520
And we're on the cusp of having an excellent story there.

51:43.520 --> 51:44.720
So well said.

51:44.720 --> 51:46.180
Well done, Valve.

51:46.180 --> 51:49.360
You've put your money where your mouth is.

51:49.360 --> 51:52.200
And you're really making a difference where it counts.

51:52.200 --> 51:53.960
So one thing that I don't understand

51:53.960 --> 51:58.480
is where does negativity come with both Electron

51:58.480 --> 52:00.600
and this Proton?

52:00.600 --> 52:04.440
I don't understand, from my side, I only see positive.

52:04.440 --> 52:08.040
I don't see why anyone would see it negatively.

52:08.040 --> 52:09.040
That's pretty simple.

52:09.040 --> 52:10.720
Some people just don't like the fact

52:10.720 --> 52:14.080
that developers aren't being pushed

52:14.080 --> 52:16.040
towards using native technologies.

52:16.040 --> 52:20.500
It's the same old story that I've got a GTK desktop,

52:20.500 --> 52:22.920
and I hate the fact that there are Qt libraries loaded

52:22.920 --> 52:23.520
on my system.

52:23.520 --> 52:25.680
Or I've got a Qt-based system, and I hate the fact

52:25.680 --> 52:27.240
there are GTK libraries on my system.

52:27.240 --> 52:29.920
Or I've got a Qt, and I hate the fact that there's Electron.

52:29.920 --> 52:31.800
People should build natively, and everything

52:31.800 --> 52:33.420
will be super performant, and it should be written

52:33.420 --> 52:35.240
in native languages, or assembler,

52:35.240 --> 52:40.800
or they're misguided that they can berate developers

52:40.800 --> 52:43.760
into doing things differently to suit them

52:43.760 --> 52:47.240
when they are a tiny, tiny speck of an audience.

52:47.240 --> 52:48.040
You can't do that.

52:48.040 --> 52:50.840
You need to welcome these developers to our platform.

52:50.840 --> 52:52.760
I don't always agree with it, but I think also there's

52:52.760 --> 52:54.840
some amount of, at least for the desktop side,

52:54.840 --> 52:56.240
of people worrying about when you

52:56.240 --> 52:58.080
have a shim layer or a common abstraction,

52:58.080 --> 52:59.160
then you write to that.

52:59.160 --> 53:00.640
And it may not take full advantage

53:00.640 --> 53:02.760
of some of the unique features of various platforms.

53:02.760 --> 53:04.640
But if people aren't going to do that anyway,

53:04.640 --> 53:06.920
if people aren't, for instance, if people aren't making Linux

53:06.920 --> 53:09.280
games for you that you want to play or that the market wants,

53:09.280 --> 53:10.560
well, then you might want that.

53:10.560 --> 53:12.800
But if you're not getting it, what choice do you have?

53:12.800 --> 53:15.880
But Proton is a much stronger story in that regard

53:15.880 --> 53:17.440
to the other solution.

53:17.440 --> 53:20.120
So we've had the likes of virtual programming

53:20.120 --> 53:23.920
in the past, which, grossly oversimplified,

53:23.920 --> 53:27.160
are a wine wrapper around a Windows game.

53:27.160 --> 53:31.040
But it was all single threaded, and at least the Proton

53:31.040 --> 53:35.560
development offers up multi-threaded capability

53:35.560 --> 53:38.000
and a whole heap of other stuff besides.

53:38.000 --> 53:43.840
So you've got to appreciate that Valve are a means to market

53:43.840 --> 53:46.720
for games publishers, and they want games publishers

53:46.720 --> 53:49.960
to be able to exploit the processing capability

53:49.960 --> 53:53.240
of the platform that they're delivering on.

53:53.240 --> 53:57.960
And I think, as a solution, there are obviously

53:57.960 --> 54:00.000
some things about this we should be cautious about,

54:00.000 --> 54:02.200
but I think Valve have done everything possible

54:02.200 --> 54:06.440
to smooth things over for people wanting

54:06.440 --> 54:09.760
to target Linux through a compatibility layer

54:09.760 --> 54:10.960
as best as they can.

54:10.960 --> 54:13.280
And I really feel they should be applauded for this,

54:13.280 --> 54:17.640
because the Valve coming to Linux in the first place

54:17.640 --> 54:21.520
was a massive blooming turning point for adoption

54:21.520 --> 54:23.080
of the Linux desktop.

54:23.080 --> 54:26.760
And this will be even more so, considerably more so.

54:26.760 --> 54:30.080
It is as big a deal as everyone's hyping it up to be.

54:30.080 --> 54:32.200
I've already talked to several people that I'm like, look,

54:32.200 --> 54:33.280
you can play these games now.

54:33.280 --> 54:34.440
I know you were holding off.

54:34.440 --> 54:36.760
You have a Windows installed just for these.

54:36.760 --> 54:38.040
No more, my friend.

54:38.040 --> 54:39.440
I've had those same conversations,

54:39.440 --> 54:41.840
and people are very excited by that.

54:41.840 --> 54:44.000
But I think there's also an aspect of this

54:44.000 --> 54:45.960
that we're maybe not giving enough attention to,

54:45.960 --> 54:47.960
and I think it's on the tip of Minimech's mind,

54:47.960 --> 54:52.560
and that is Vulkan is the wild card in this.

54:52.560 --> 54:55.720
In some cases, we're going from very low-level DirectX 12

54:55.720 --> 54:58.080
calls, which are already quite similar to Vulkan,

54:58.080 --> 55:01.120
and just translating them to native, local Vulkan.

55:01.120 --> 55:03.240
And that's going to be a big piece, right, Minimech?

55:03.240 --> 55:05.280
Yeah, I think that's the whole thing.

55:05.280 --> 55:07.520
I mean, that whole thing is very future-proof,

55:07.520 --> 55:11.480
because as I understand, Windows games supporting Vulkan

55:11.480 --> 55:15.000
only have to translate the Windows game part, not

55:15.000 --> 55:16.360
the graphics rendering part.

55:16.360 --> 55:18.880
That is Vulkan that takes all the stuff.

55:18.880 --> 55:22.720
And the old DirectX thing is encapsulated in Vulkan,

55:22.720 --> 55:25.200
so it is a huge push for Vulkan.

55:25.200 --> 55:28.280
And I would like to have some responses of macOS,

55:28.280 --> 55:30.160
of the Apple people, about that.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.440
Yes, right.

55:31.440 --> 55:32.380
Oh, good point.

55:32.380 --> 55:35.480
There's terrible support for that kind of stuff on macOS.

55:35.480 --> 55:37.440
I mean, the kind of ebb and flow, like OpenGL

55:37.440 --> 55:39.440
is just horrible right now.

55:39.440 --> 55:41.600
But Metal support's fantastic, so I

55:41.600 --> 55:44.920
guess you just need one more shim to convert it to Metal.

55:44.920 --> 55:45.520
Yeah.

55:45.520 --> 55:46.520
Yeah, well, there is.

55:46.520 --> 55:47.000
There is.

55:47.000 --> 55:51.840
There's MoltenVK, which is like the shim

55:51.840 --> 55:57.240
to Metal for Vulkan API calls, which is very decent

55:57.240 --> 56:03.320
and can certainly facilitate those targeting requirements.

56:03.320 --> 56:06.780
But Valve were quite clear that macOS

56:06.780 --> 56:10.640
doesn't feature in this initiative at the moment

56:10.640 --> 56:12.740
or possibly at all.

56:12.740 --> 56:14.240
Well, could you blame them?

56:14.240 --> 56:18.960
Well, are Mac shipping many devices

56:18.960 --> 56:22.480
with significant enough graphics capability

56:22.480 --> 56:25.400
to be a serious gaming platform?

56:25.400 --> 56:28.700
And unless you're prepared to shell out 12 grand,

56:28.700 --> 56:30.360
the answer is no.

56:30.360 --> 56:32.040
So why would?

56:32.040 --> 56:34.640
I mean, that's like super niche.

56:34.640 --> 56:36.200
You think we're a niche audience,

56:36.200 --> 56:42.520
but those people that can afford an iMac Pro with the Vega 64

56:42.520 --> 56:45.800
option and everything else, that is a super niche audience.

56:45.800 --> 56:48.720
So you can probably appreciate why they're not

56:48.720 --> 56:50.480
investing effort there right now.

56:50.480 --> 56:52.240
Yeah, that's a point well made.

56:52.240 --> 56:55.000
I've got one thought at the back of my mind.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.360
OK.

56:56.360 --> 56:58.520
That I'm a little bit like, I wonder

56:58.520 --> 57:01.400
how this is going to play out.

57:01.400 --> 57:03.000
This is all great stuff.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.240
But as far as I'm aware, and I'm very

57:06.240 --> 57:09.640
happy to be proven wrong about this, so if you know better,

57:09.640 --> 57:13.480
do contact Chris, not me, do contact Chris,

57:13.480 --> 57:15.080
and let him know how wrong I was.

57:15.080 --> 57:19.800
He'll bring it to my attention in low bandwidth form.

57:19.800 --> 57:24.360
Wine is X11 exclusively right now.

57:24.360 --> 57:27.440
I wonder how much of this effort is

57:27.440 --> 57:33.960
going to be targeted at bringing Proton, stroke wine,

57:33.960 --> 57:38.360
to talk Wayland natively, or how much of this effort

57:38.360 --> 57:41.760
is purely going to be focused around implementing

57:41.760 --> 57:46.080
the compatibility necessarily on top of the X11 stack

57:46.080 --> 57:49.320
that these games run more reliably?

57:49.320 --> 57:53.000
And will this defer and push back

57:53.000 --> 57:56.560
the general acceptance of Wayland

57:56.560 --> 57:58.840
as a display server technology?

57:58.840 --> 58:03.520
Or will they become some of our most frequent ex-Wayland apps?

58:03.520 --> 58:04.560
That's a good question.

58:04.560 --> 58:07.720
And you have to wonder if it's not a chicken and the egg

58:07.720 --> 58:10.480
problem with graphics drivers.

58:10.480 --> 58:12.120
To really develop that, you would

58:12.120 --> 58:15.680
need a Linux box with full proprietary 3D

58:15.680 --> 58:18.720
graphics to troubleshoot and test.

58:18.720 --> 58:20.080
And you've got to get that first.

58:20.080 --> 58:23.640
Well, you'd do better with the fully open source

58:23.640 --> 58:25.880
drivers for Wayland stuff.

58:25.880 --> 58:26.360
Sure.

58:26.360 --> 58:31.400
So I'm not close enough to the development of these things

58:31.400 --> 58:36.320
to know how prioritized Wayland is in this story.

58:36.320 --> 58:39.800
And if it features at all, or if it features significantly.

58:39.800 --> 58:42.280
But I'll be very interested to see

58:42.280 --> 58:46.440
whether targeting Wayland is something that's

58:46.440 --> 58:50.040
of paramount importance, that it helps deliver Wayland

58:50.040 --> 58:54.040
to the Linux desktop, or if it's something that pushes back

58:54.040 --> 58:57.160
the acceptance of the Wayland desktop

58:57.160 --> 59:00.160
because there is a significant enough performance

59:00.160 --> 59:04.680
impact on these games being run through compatibility layers

59:04.680 --> 59:07.160
that people just aren't prepared to go there yet.

59:07.160 --> 59:08.920
Just as the transition to Wayland

59:08.920 --> 59:14.080
was looking simple and smooth, this has to come along.

59:14.080 --> 59:17.280
I can answer this because I'm working pretty closely

59:17.280 --> 59:19.120
with Wayland and Mir.

59:19.120 --> 59:23.000
And I would say the answer to this is NVIDIA.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.520
NVIDIA, they play proprietary drivers.

59:26.520 --> 59:29.560
They don't work at all with any of the Wayland stuff

59:29.560 --> 59:35.400
without needing to use their L stream APIs.

59:35.400 --> 59:39.840
And without NVIDIA support, most of the graphics

59:39.840 --> 59:42.760
cards that the game must have, which is NVIDIA,

59:42.760 --> 59:44.440
doesn't work on Wayland.

59:44.440 --> 59:45.820
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

59:45.820 --> 59:49.600
That's where I would expect the main cause of angst to be.

59:49.600 --> 59:52.120
And like I said, a bit of a chicken and egg there.

59:52.120 --> 59:54.440
And maybe somebody could reach out to NVIDIA

59:54.440 --> 59:56.560
and encourage them to pick up the pace on that.

59:56.560 --> 59:57.200
Maybe.

59:57.200 --> 59:57.880
We'll see.

59:57.880 --> 59:59.040
Somebody.

59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.800
There is no need to pick up the pace,

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.760
though, on the community's development

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:05.280
around Steam Play and Proton.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:07.440
There's already really cool sites set up.

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:09.800
I'll recommend one called Proton.City.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.160
That's where I learned how to get Age of Empires 2 working.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.580
You just type in the game there.

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:16.240
And then it'll tell you the status, the workarounds.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.040
It's a little slow right now because it's getting slammed.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:21.800
But they've got reviews and all of that stuff.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.400
And it's all dynamically generated.

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.400
So it's Proton.City.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:27.960
And that's how I got Age of Empires working.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.400
And I'm very, very, very happy about it.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.440
There's also some lists.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.720
There's some Google Docs out there

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.440
that have all of the games and their status and notes.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:35.600
And it's staggering.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.680
It's thousands of games.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.900
It's so staggering that it kills your browser trying

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.280
to load the spreadsheet of the list of games.

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.040
That's how massive it is.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.240
And there is just so much energy.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:50.520
There's so much passion.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.120
This is definitely a net positive.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.640
And I have hired people that are concerned that it will

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:56.720
de-incentivize more native games.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.400
Steam was pretty upfront.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.800
And they had a good, you know, they talk right there.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.960
If I'm trying to target Linux natively, just target Vulkan.

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.720
Use that.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.360
And hopefully, maybe less than in the desktop space.

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:08.120
Maybe not.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.160
Games are already somewhat disconnected.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.600
Now, they do need a bunch of stuff

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.360
to do to sound and tied to internet and all that.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.660
But they're already something that's not just another desktop

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:16.200
application.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.360
They're a pretty niche use case that's

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.340
segmented from a regular desktop.

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:26.360
So I think we need a cheering test for Proton.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:31.240
And I think the rules for the cheering test for Proton

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:35.360
are, can it run Fortnite yet?

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:40.600
And until the outcome of that question is an unequivocal yes,

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:42.840
then, you know, we're not there.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.640
But as soon as it runs Fortnite, then we're all sorted.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:46.640
Yeah, we do need to get that.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.640
We do need to get that.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:50.400
That is an embarrassing weak spot.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:51.980
I have not really gotten to Fortnite.

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:53.480
But I have heard people bring it up.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.680
And everybody else, every other platform's got it.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.520
That's a good one.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:57.560
Does it run Fortnite?

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:58.520
We will wait and see.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.640
I bet you it happens sooner than later.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.240
It's not published on Steam.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.240
So Valve have got no skin in the game

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:08.400
on making that one work, right?

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.360
I will include a link in the show notes

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.840
on how to run Proton from the command line.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.600
So it is possible to just point it at an executable and go.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.520
So that might help.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.360
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:21.800
if I can dig it up again.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.440
Also, another link I'll have in there

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.040
is, this also helps if you just want to use it sort of outside

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:29.440
of Steam, is there's Proton tricks, like winetricks,

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.180
that lets you set some of the registry stuff and whatever.

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:35.680
I don't know whatever Windows calls it.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.720
So yeah, there's now Proton tricks

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.680
where you can apply actions and whatnot,

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.080
or apply it even to specific games and things.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.480
So people are developing tools around this, directories.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:49.160
There's just all kinds of stuff coming together.

01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.840
So it's a good time for this kind of thing,

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.440
because it seems like the community was just

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.480
super hungry for it.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.280
And within days, we've seen all of this stuff get set up,

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:00.920
all of these resources, all of these games tested.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.880
It's like people are sitting around just

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.560
waiting to play video games.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.400
Is there anything else anyone wants to chime in

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.080
before we wrap this one up?

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.960
Well, do we think there's going to be another round of Steam

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.320
machine investment here now that it might actually

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.280
be able to play some of the games you want?

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.160
Right.

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:18.840
Yeah.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.360
What is next for Steam OS now?

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.960
And will it be a doubling down?

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:25.160
Will it be integrated into big picture mode and all that?

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:29.400
Or is this a acknowledgment that, you know what?

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.280
You can go get Ubuntu 18.04.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.040
You can load our Steam package on there,

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.520
and everything's good to go.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.520
The kernel improvements are all there.

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.960
The graphics drivers work.

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.680
And with our Steam client, we have all these libraries

01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.800
and Proton now.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.760
Maybe this is a shifting of the landscape,

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:48.920
and Steam machines are just not as necessary,

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:50.600
he says in a questioning voice.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.360
We'll have to wait and see.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.520
Yeah, I guess stay tuned and find out.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.900
That probably won't be what we're talking about next week,

01:03:56.900 --> 01:03:59.080
but we'd love to have you guys join us there.

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.720
If you're all done, then that's good.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.680
We don't have to go get the links at linuxunplug.com

01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.560
slash 264.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.520
That's fine.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:06.600
You don't have to.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:07.920
But if you want a little more, you

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.400
want a little more content, go check out the Ubuntu podcast

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.480
where you can get more poppy and wimpy.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:15.320
And their cohort, Mark, is on the Ubuntu podcast,

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.880
ubuntupodcast.org.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:17.400
Good episode.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.800
I love that episode on Academy.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.520
That was really fascinating.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.320
I thought that was a really well-done take

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.360
on going to an event, too.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.640
Just going to an event and then summarizing it in a show

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.520
is not always super easy, and I thought you nailed it, poppy.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.600
So great episode of Ubuntu podcast.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.400
Thank you.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.360
And go get more Wes Payne over at techsnap.systems.

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.240
He's at Wes Payne on the Twitter.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.080
Do it.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.360
And the whole network is at jupitersignal.

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.160
linuxunplug.com is our site.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.880
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next Tuesday.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:49.000
And we'll see you next time.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:05:16.120
All right, let's name this thing.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.440
Now wimpy, did the title go through

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.240
that you were thinking we were going to see?

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:20.760
Did that make its way through?

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.080
Yeah, that made its way through.

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.640
I went for a super long version and then trimmed it down.

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:28.320
OK, let's go take a look at this thing.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.640
JBtitles.

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.760
It's number one.

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.200
I'm feeling confident in my prediction for this week's

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.000
show title.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.320
Oh, my goodness.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.440
That is pretty good.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.280
It is long, but it is pretty good.

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:41.200
I can give you an even shortened version.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.840
You can just go for proton electron for games.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:45.520
Yeah, that's nice.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.240
That's nice.

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.400
That is good.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.760
All right, that's going to be pretty hard to beat.

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:53.520
I also know that's going to irritate people

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.640
that I know and I'm friends with horribly, but hey-ho.

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:59.720
It's the meme.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:03.920
It's summarizing the meme within the peanut gallery

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:06.160
in four words or less.

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.640
That's all we've ever wanted from a title.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.120
I love it.

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.160
I'm going for it.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.600
I'm going with the slightly shorter version, proton

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.320
electron for games.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.600
Now what did we miss this week, Wes?

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:18.480
Oh, I was just going to say, I was

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:22.400
happy to see that proton counts as Linux for Steam Play.

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.800
So if you're going to get surveyed,

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:25.560
if you're running it through proton,

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:27.000
it counts as Linux, not Windows.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.320
Yeah, that is a good point to make.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.560
Yeah, we should have made that in the show.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.920
It's always been this way, too.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.280
It's the way the Valve system works.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.280
It's whatever system you've played the most on

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:36.080
after two weeks.

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:41.840
Who here has purchased a game as a result of the Steam Play

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:42.960
data?

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.480
I did.

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:43.960
I did.

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.560
I bought Age of Empires.

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.320
Yeah, so did I.

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:49.400
I bought over a dozen.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:50.600
Oh.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:52.400
Well, they were in packs.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.800
They were racing stroke driving games in packs.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.120
So why wouldn't I?

01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.440
Now when the Steam sale is on, I'm

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.160
not going to feel so limited.

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:02.840
I'm going to just go crazy.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.320
And my wallet's going to be empty in no time at all.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:08.080
Yeah.

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:08.840
That's very true.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:12.800
But you do need to check these community-driven,

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.680
does it work?

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:17.320
Because I was looking at those like, is my investment safe?

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.600
You know, if I buy this thing.

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.480
And the curious thing is, the only game that

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:25.920
doesn't work for me is Doom, which is white listed.

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:31.120
And I put my Steam client in give me all the things mode.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:35.720
And everything that I purchased outside of it's tested

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:39.480
and supported worked until I decided

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:41.120
I'm going to purchase Doom.

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:41.600
Nothing.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.040
Black screen and music.

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:43.880
That's all I get.

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.840
I'm not going to do that.

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.120
I'm not going to hold back.

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:49.000
I'm just going to buy it and have the confidence

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
that someone out there will fix this for me.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.120
And because there are going to be plenty of gamers out there.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.440
That is the Linux way, my friend.

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:57.640
Yeah, I'll just rant on Twitter if it doesn't work.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:13.960
That's the way.
