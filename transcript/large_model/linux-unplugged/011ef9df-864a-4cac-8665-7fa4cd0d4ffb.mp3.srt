1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
All right well before we get the show started there is one topic I thought

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,480
this is probably gonna be one of the top news stories in the Linux action show on

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,060
Sunday but maybe we kick it around the virtual lug first did you guys see the

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,480
story that broke this morning that factory for openSUSE is moving to a

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,200
full-fledged rolling release distro full-on rolling distro now what do you

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:30,960
guys think says the canonical guy we're in a year you know Ubuntu is gonna be

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,960
doing the same thing here's what I wonder is you know how they announced

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,560
that this next release was kind of just gonna be a maintenance release while they

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,440
worked on the back end stuff I'm wondering if this was a one-two punch

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,520
all along like well they knew they were gonna do this and so they had a lot of

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,200
replumbing to do and so they were working on this and and the way they're

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,000
gonna do this now is it's kind of an interesting system where there's still

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,440
gonna be some automated testing that goes in before it lands and instead of

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,280
having to do like big release candidates and and stable beta snapshots before a

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,640
big release is essentially they're just gonna firm this thing up as a release

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:12,240
gets closer and then just carve it off and say here you go well only you don't

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,680
make the the daily the rolling version of it like like a sanctioned what would

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,320
you guys call it a respin like I you know like from a yeah we do we do on the

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,160
phone this is exactly what we do right right right I'm interesting will come to

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,080
the desktop in the future so how does it work so on on Ubuntu there's not like on

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,240
Ubuntu phone there's just new builds all the time there's not like this is rc1

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,400
rc2 it's like nope this is just the latest building is every build then QA

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,680
tested yeah automated testing on desktops and devices in the lab like

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,040
physical phones in the lab probably much the same way as openSUSE we're doing it

25
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,920
and and then you you bless one that passes you know 100% clear testing well

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,680
here's what they said in the old development model an army of packages

27
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,560
would shoot new packages and updates to factory with a relatively small team of

28
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,160
factory maintainers taking care of the integration process of all those

29
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,360
packages this took a long time to stabilize and rip for release in the new

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,400
rolling release development model package submissions cannot go to factory

31
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,080
directly first they have to prove to be functional and trustworthy in a staging

32
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,120
project staging projects are projects in our open build service where groups of

33
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,200
submissions are collected reviewed compiled and tested with open QA after

34
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,160
the packages survive the staging project they go directly into factory so they're

35
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,560
using open build service and open QA to bang on it first and then that system

36
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,120
then I guess releases it into factory so when you're doing on your rolling open

37
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,960
SUSE release when you're doing a daily update you're theoretically pulling down

38
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,840
updates that the open QA process has already banged on this to me and what's

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,520
interesting I don't know if you guys have picked this up I got a couple links

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,520
in the show notes like the muck and a few other places are really really

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,080
really pushing as this is a comparison to arch they'll say well in arch they do

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,960
it this way or in a response to arch do you guys think this is really openSUSE

43
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:14,040
it trying to respond to arch no it's just is them responding to the way the

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,760
application developers are doing this if you look at the way that Chrome and

45
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:25,320
Firefox are pushing out updates to their applications they they have a very rapid

46
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:32,400
release cycle and you can you can very quickly get the very latest crack on

47
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,800
your machine by subscribing to a particular particular channel being like

48
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,200
the beta channel or canary or whatever and I don't think arch matters one iota

49
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:52,260
to openSUSE because opens the open build services supported arch packaging for a

50
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,360
good while now so they've embraced the arch community some time ago and I think

51
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,160
arch has claimed a lot of longer term power linux users now but I do wonder

52
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,660
how many of them are simply there because like Popey says they want the

53
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,440
freshest crack but if you could give them super fresh crack without some of

54
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,880
the arch hassle or you know arch intimidation that some people still see

55
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,600
arch hassle well the setup right and not having things pre-configured for you so

56
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,320
like that's only once you only do that once don't you once you've done that you

57
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,640
get the daily crack every day well who you telling you're a winner well you

58
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,400
tell me I know that but I'm just thinking from people outside that you're

59
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,200
kind of lying that you have to go through some magical hoops to get to

60
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:43,440
that goal it's only once yeah yeah I don't think that openSUSE's decision to

61
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,000
do this matters one I don't think arch was a deciding factor to be honest yeah

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,160
probably not I don't suspect it was more to do with fedora spinning off their

63
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,720
core and desktop next and all the rest of it initiatives I mean kind of like

64
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,080
Popey was getting to too though doesn't it just make more sense from a

65
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,800
development standpoint shouldn't this be how yeah oh absolutely but it's kind of

66
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,560
funny because that testing spart spot is the new factory the and factories the

67
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,080
new tumbleweed yeah is the way I see it it does see like I think so and tumble

68
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,640
weed I guess kind of goes into like it's still being used but it's not as

69
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,800
directly involved anymore I am kind of confused on yeah well Greg Crow Hartman

70
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,400
did write something in our it a kind of response to it yeah he at this point

71
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,080
doesn't know what's gonna happen to tumbleweed as a result of this but it's

72
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,200
not like a huge thing for him anymore it's kind of sounds like he just been

73
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,680
nursing it along for the last couple of months he says yeah so yeah that's

74
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,960
that's the gist I got from that if he consolidates them both into one then

75
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,080
less work for everyone and more benefit for everyone else yeah I know you know

76
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,720
soos has a kick-ass system manager and also they've got snapper that better for fs

77
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,600
snapshot tool right into the system manager so they've got a lot of maybe

78
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,800
just got the other PR kind of sucks and you know the other thing that's

79
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,400
interesting on the opposite of they have the evergreen which is essentially their

80
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,720
LTS so now they've got rolling I guess they've got something in the middle the

81
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,560
stable versions that they'll release still which will have which will have

82
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,920
support windows and then they've got the evergreen LTS style releases so now

83
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,920
there's the whole gambit there that they're spanning I really think this is

84
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,720
interesting because we were just talking what does open suits are really have to

85
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,160
offer the Linux community and this I think we're starting to see that come to

86
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,320
fruition manager maybe we need to step up the PR though you know get their

87
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,520
team going and like reporting and shit if they put the name out of open suits a

88
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,920
little bit more so then we're not just talking about it as if it's some you

89
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:51,360
know loner in the corner it might actually be good seems like everybody's

90
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,400
always talking about open system but nobody actually uses it well I wonder if

91
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,000
this isn't sort of isn't this sort of a tuck and roll to make them like to sort

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,800
of adapt to the changing way things are done in Linux and say okay we're where

93
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,280
we want to kind of pivot and become a great distribution for those of you who

94
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,560
want to really be working on the edge of open source software you want a system

95
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,600
that's been well engineered and that some real thought has gone into that has

96
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,320
some tools to make your daily Linux driving use a little bit easier like you

97
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,440
know things like yas and actual graphical update management utilities

98
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,040
because let's remember I mean yes we're up we've been talking about arch but on

99
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,320
arch everything's command line some people don't like that that sometimes

100
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,780
is enough for some people they just want a graphical front end to some of these

101
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,040
tools plus you got a big company behind it which makes some people feel a

102
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,940
little bit better so now you can say okay I'm a developer I'd like to have

103
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,080
cutting-edge software but maybe have it'll be a little more stable and tested

104
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,920
assuming that they can keep things fresh and tested and I want something that's

105
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,560
well designed and that could be people could be looking around going well open

106
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,480
Sousa could be the way to go and I think this is why it is more of a response to

107
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,920
fedora than anything else so then maybe this is really what they're bringing to

108
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,800
the table I think it's a response to the world everybody wants stuff faster they

109
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,880
have to do something to keep the market share up yeah do you think that maybe

110
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,200
the perception about open Sousa and its marketing and its message is regional

111
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,880
because certainly in Europe open Sousa is a big big thing everyone knows that

112
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:21,440
message gets through quite loud and clear yeah yeah I think it is somewhat

113
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,360
regional but then again I mean what we were talking about in the context of

114
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,080
last week is if you wanted not necessarily like in like it's great you

115
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,000
know the open Sousa does really obviously has markets it does really

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,160
well and what we were kind of making the case was is if you were going to sort of

117
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:42,040
introduce a brand new game-changing technology to Linux like systemd or some

118
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,480
standard desktop application container technology across the board or a

119
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,680
universal package format something crazy pie in the sky right if you were going

120
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,560
to do something like that could it be the open Sousa group that would be able

121
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,600
to introduce it and have it take off and I would argue we've seen some things

122
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,000
they've done that are really cool like like OBS or the gallery that you would

123
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,640
think other that were built for other districts distributions to take

124
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,080
advantage of that are you know like they're they're even paying the bill for

125
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,120
it and still it really hasn't gone outside of their ecosystem that's where

126
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,560
we were talking about relevancy before and I don't know if this changes that

127
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,040
position or not the problem with open Sousa is that they have a ton of awesome

128
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,320
ideas and they create like the OBS in the studio all these things are just

129
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,520
like concept wise they're awesome but they never fully finished them and never

130
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,560
polish them so there's a ton of breakage with the OBS I mean it's so much of a

131
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,640
pain to use the OBS that's why people just ignore it hmm I wonder if to by

132
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,560
being rolling and faster and more nimble like this if they introduce a cool

133
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,840
technology that maybe it gets faster adoption because people can get their

134
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,960
hands on it quicker and start playing with it sooner maybe also getting

135
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:03,880
packages into the factory it's a lot easier as well

136
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,440
welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show the rocks of beard and

137
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,240
knows how to use it my name is Chris my name is Matt I just you'll get the

138
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,600
beard reference later on I'm just gonna leave that out there now we got a big

139
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,440
show today because we got back from OS con and we're like well we have a huge

140
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,720
Linux action show and we still have more stuff to play so we have some exclusive

141
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,880
interviews from the floor of OS con coming up as well as our takeaway from

142
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:34,040
the trip some interesting trends we observed and also a plea if you will

143
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,760
plus we'll recap the trip itself and then later on in the show we got a

144
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,260
little stuff that's coming up that we could use the community's input on so if

145
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,160
you are a crux user or have looked at the crux distribution stay tuned towards

146
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,700
the end of the show we got a special call out for you guys Matt big show

147
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,040
today big show so let's bring in the mumble team so that way they can

148
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,720
assemble and join us mumble room prepare your minds for the feedback because last

149
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,600
week we dared to boldly venture into productivity land I had no idea you know

150
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,660
what people use Linux for getting work done turns out that's right not video

151
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:13,160
games no no no silly video games we like to get things done yeah yeah so when we

152
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,680
talked on the topic of productivity we apparently we sparked some feedback so

153
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,200
I'm gonna cover just a couple of them because I don't want to like the people

154
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,760
who don't care about productivity stuff under Linux I don't want them to tune

155
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,120
out so we got two two I wanted to start with our first email this week it came

156
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,080
in in regards to my Thunderbird quest which I didn't get like a great answer

157
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,800
but this one was a really great extension I'm by the way I'm looking if

158
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,960
you have great extensions to make Thunderbird really rock I'd love to hear

159
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,440
about like I got some of the basics like I have one that lets me see the mail

160
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,600
agent that people used to send me emails so I know when they're on Outlook and

161
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,120
I've also got you know like of course the GPG encryption for Thunderbird and

162
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,240
stuff like that but Mark wrote in with an interesting one it's called

163
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,800
conversation threads and he says I highly recommend the Thunderbird

164
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,440
conversations extension it displays email as a chronological thread rather

165
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,680
than a single message even if the emails themselves are spread across folders like

166
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,680
you know between inbox and sent which is pretty cool Matt I seem to remember this

167
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,360
since you said conversation thread I instantly flashed back to my Thunderbird

168
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,160
days yes it is an awesome application I have it does not care where the email is

169
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,640
it works great that's nice I like that it goes across the inbox there I have a

170
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,360
link to it in the show notes if you're a Thunderbird user and watch it I

171
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,320
actually I put this one on there the one thing that it does that I don't like and

172
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,680
you could probably turn this off and I haven't looked into it is it also

173
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,920
changes the way Thunderbird displays your email so it looks like Gmail and

174
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,680
the reason I'm using Thunderbird is to get away from the way Gmail displays

175
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,880
some things so yeah yeah there's a little bit of getting used to if I

176
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,560
remember correctly it does like little mini panes kind of overlapping and you

177
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,880
can collapse and expand and what right I was okay with it I was okay yeah the

178
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,360
benefit is that you can also use Enigmail for like encryption and whatnot

179
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,160
that Gmail can't do yeah so there's plenty of and some people like the way

180
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,480
Gmail does it right so that's then it's a win-win if you do I use it with

181
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,920
Thunderbird when I'm using Thunderbird when I just feel like it and yeah it's

182
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,280
amazing it just organizes it it gets rid of that huge thick header bar yeah

183
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,960
that's true that is nice Matt and I were scratching our heads on

184
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,640
Sunday one of the I think Matt you mentioned Nitro tasks I meant to mention

185
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:29,120
wonder tasks we also mentioned to do dot text for task managers under Linux

186
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,480
Randy writes in with a really great suggestion he says love the show so my

187
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,520
first time commenting on last 323 you had listener asking about a task manager

188
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,960
application as someone who is always searching for the perfect task manager

189
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,000
this caught my attention so I have a suggestion to offer of course here he

190
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,680
says its selection always depends on your particular requirements that's a

191
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,840
standard disclaimer but here's what he wants from a task manager and I think

192
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,840
we'll probably all agree with this cross platform so you can use it on any OS

193
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,280
work or home synchronized across multiple machines specific task

194
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,200
management features I like such as subtasks oh that's nice allows me to

195
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,080
print out my task list and scribble on it during the day oh that's nice too and

196
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,400
accessible from an Android device all right so this is this sounds perfect he

197
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,640
says the solution I found and I'm pretty happy using is task unifier pro task

198
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,440
unifier one word pro as a task manager which is very full feature gives me the

199
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,840
kind of interface I want it syncs with to doodle to doodle which gives me cross

200
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,440
machine syncing access on Android and as a backup I know some of the audience

201
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,520
might find this helpful he says I was able to finally settle down on one task

202
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,080
manager after a long search keep up the great work Randy so there you go it's

203
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,320
called task unifier pro I haven't tried it out yet but that list sounds killer

204
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,080
oh it sounds like because I've been kind of looking for something like that that

205
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,380
might actually scratch my itch yeah yeah and you can find it at task unifier dot

206
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:52,920
com it looks like here's a it looks like maybe it's a Java app actually

207
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,760
potentially yeah I'm looking at it right now I don't yeah it works for Mac

208
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,680
Windows and Linux task unifier yeah it's any operating system supported by Java

209
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,880
so there you go I won't judge it based on the Java thing I'm not a big Java guy

210
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,680
but I would check it out yeah had me until Java yeah I mean there is that but

211
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,760
you know I already I just what I just put job oh I got a new game I got a new

212
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,320
game that requires Java so now I've got Java on my computer so I already got

213
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,360
Java minecraft isn't new no not minecraft it's like a fallen sky I

214
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,720
think is the game have you guys seen this it's on Steam right now you guys

215
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,760
follow gaming on Linux remember we had the one the the main writer from gaming

216
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,640
on Linux on the show a few weeks ago he did let me go find it he did it he did

217
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,880
it he's been doing a really interesting kind of like from time to time he's been

218
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,840
emailing popular Linux game developers and getting them to actually release

219
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,720
their Linux sales numbers to him and yeah yeah and it's really it's not

220
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,920
awesome it's really not awesome usually isn't no he just he just posted part 3

221
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,840
on gaming on linux.com and the game that I picked up after this list that I

222
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,520
realized I didn't have he's got a whole bunch on here and some of them are

223
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:17,720
pretty good Linux like spy chameleon 5% Linux installs rust rust says that 0.4

224
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:25,160
and 0 1% in July so rust sales are 1% in July the fall represents 4.5 sales for

225
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:31,160
Steam and when you and humble if you if you factor all those in flash out to 16.1

226
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,160
percent of Steam sales are Linux well that's not bad 16% almost noticeable

227
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:42,400
quest of dungeons 1% Linux 5% Mac 94% Windows far sky with oh that was the

228
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,520
game I got 0.89% Linux that was that surprised me because far sky is actually

229
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,080
a pretty cool-looking game where you go underwater

230
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:00,000
and you get to explore an underwater world and find like cool stuff and it's

231
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,080
got pretty good graphics too and there's like underwater facilities I don't know

232
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,480
I guess it takes place in the future I just got it but it requires Java but you

233
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:12,920
have to survive underwater find food find items find money you have to grow

234
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,360
stuff in like hibernation chambers under the water obviously there's fish you

235
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,840
have to battle with so for the kid like the boy was like oh yeah I want that

236
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,760
game I was like yeah we could easily he's got less than 1% Linux sales let's

237
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,680
boost that up a little bit I think it would be an obvious game but maybe it's

238
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,560
just the fact that people aren't aware of it enough on the Linux platform that

239
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,600
yeah that's what I was wondering because after I got it I'm like yeah why is this

240
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,080
not more popular to be honest with you because it just gets cooler and cooler

241
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,360
as you play it too so it's called far sky and it's see it's it's maybe this is

242
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,160
why I don't know it's 15 bucks on Steam yeah I guess I might be a little high

243
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,600
for some folks but I feel like we've all gotten a little out of whack and what

244
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,680
our game pricing is it's been out since April so if you want to check it out you

245
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,800
can maybe boosters anyways and then the game go check out gaming on Linux where

246
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,000
they have have more stats for Linux sales it's it's getting better we're not

247
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,600
competitive yet with the Mac and I would say the Mac isn't quite on par with what

248
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,460
the sales need to be at so I continue to buy and I just like to remind folks too

249
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,000
that if you do if you do want to buy steam games you should do it under Linux

250
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,080
because then it counts always always yeah don't don't ever buy under windows

251
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,920
because at that point you're really sending not only mixed messages you're

252
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,040
sending the wrong message yeah exactly I think I think it's pretty so I mean

253
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,240
$15 for a game that's gonna give you hours of entertainment how I don't I

254
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,400
don't get why people aren't willing to fork that over I mean have they gotten

255
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,320
so spoiled by like the humble bundle and all these free-to-plays that they're not

256
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,720
willing to fork out $15 really people I think so and app stores have skewed our

257
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,840
perspective too I think it's app stores and I also think it's a matter of

258
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,600
something that the folks on the Windows platform will do often as they reach out

259
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,600
to be folks that do let's plays if you're a if you're a game developer and

260
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,440
you're not doing that you're an idiot I'm sorry yeah I mean it's like you are

261
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,080
really screwing yourself on that one because at the end of the day that's how

262
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,160
you get your word out for maximum cheap they got to learn how to market to the

263
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,040
Linux community because they've never really had to reach out to us before and

264
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,880
spread the word and you know I also I look I look at it this way too I think

265
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,720
that if if maybe it's one of these things where people start to it's gonna

266
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,520
take a long time to kind of warm over the crowd because it's been it's there's a

267
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,720
culture built up around it now and even when we talk about it on the show people

268
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,680
hate it even though it's like one of the biggest things to happen to Linux

269
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,360
desktop people hate it when we talk about games and we'll see what happens

270
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,940
with it keep watching it I hope their sales improve I really do because I'd

271
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,720
love to see Steam OS really take off and maybe it will once Steam OS itself

272
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,000
actually actually ships in in in more homes maybe like cuz you know you can

273
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,120
get Steam OS now but you have to roll it yourself hey I want to talk about

274
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:50,480
something huge that's happening on the GTK side that we have lambasted them

275
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,040
for right here on this very show because you know Gwadek's going on and so of

276
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,820
course we got to get some gnome news and I think some people are gonna be happy

277
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,760
about this be curious to get wimpy's reaction to first I want to tell you

278
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,200
about an awesome opportunity head over to Linux Academy dot-com slash unplugged

279
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,520
right now go over to Linux Academy dot-com slash

280
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,840
unplugged because they got a special promo going just for you guys it's the

281
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,080
summer of learning and you know there's sunshine out there and you need a good

282
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,600
excuse to avoid that sunshine absolutely right I mean who wants to get stuck

283
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,520
actually out in the nice weather not me my friends Linux Academy dot-com slash

284
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,500
unplugged but on a serious note this is a genuine resource for you to go and

285
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,400
take your Linux skills up to the next level they have so many really awesome

286
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,480
courses and you can see why you'd want to subscribe to this for example you

287
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,560
could just take the basic Linux level 1 exam 101 type stuff but then you can

288
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,520
move up through the stack everything up to introductions to Android developments

289
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,240
they they span the entire gamut plus they have seven plus Linux distributions

290
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,000
you get to choose from and the courseware then is automatically adjusted

291
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,920
based on the distro that you pick and they have downloadable comprehensive

292
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,920
study guides audio and video that you can watch and learn and listen to while

293
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,400
you're say driving or sitting at the computer doing the courseware they have

294
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,960
a ton of self-paced labs which is really cool because then later on you can go

295
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,260
back and quiz yourself and see what you've picked up this is for me I have

296
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,640
found a great resource to kind of see what do I have a into it for what can I

297
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,640
kind of pick up what's in my wheelhouse do I have an interest in this particular

298
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,960
technology do I want to learn Python these kinds of questions are so easy to

299
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,440
be answered just by going to Linux Academy dot-com slash down plugged and

300
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,920
get that 33 percent discount that's only $50 per quarter the other really cool

301
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,280
thing is they're doubling down on AWS infrastructure courses as well so if you

302
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,880
need to do a little Linux and AWS stuff they have scenario based training you

303
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,440
can go through and actually implement something so you walk away with an

304
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,720
actual usable product a skill set you could apply to a job something you could

305
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,100
put on a resume something that you can learn yourself to see how that system

306
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,180
works Linux Academy comm slash unplugged to get that nice deal so let me get the

307
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,000
straight if I'm in a hard place and it's like look I'm looking at gaining some

308
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,440
new skills and I've got three months to kill and I can pop 50 bucks forward I

309
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,520
get three months 50 bucks and I get a new marketable skill that's awesome oh

310
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,800
absolutely and there's a community there that helps like people to go out and get

311
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,600
testing and gives them support and answers and you know it kind of keeps

312
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,600
you going because there's people that genuinely care they're also doing a lot

313
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,960
of live stream events now so you can interact with the folks that are doing

314
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,400
the teaching so there's a good back and forth there it's an amazing resource

315
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,920
mat and what's really cool is it's essentially three Linux advocates are

316
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,960
like you know we need to have we have between all of us here we've got web

317
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,880
development skills we've got years of training experience we can build this

318
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,680
right and we know exactly what other Linux users would want from a service

319
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,520
like this and I think that's really remarkable because what you walk away

320
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:40,040
from is a new understanding of perhaps how a different distribution does

321
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:44,280
something how to deploy something I mean it is genuine tangible benefits that you

322
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,600
get to walk away from with a service like this Linux Academy comm slash

323
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,680
unplugged go take advantage of the summer of learning and you get to keep

324
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,520
all of the courseware the study material all of that stuff they have tests where

325
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,560
you can check yourself how far you've gotten it's such a cool service and I'm

326
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,600
so happy they're a sponsor Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and thanks

327
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,840
everybody who supports the show by visiting our sponsors okay I teased it a

328
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,600
little bit you guys might have saw this it was a blog post blogs.nome.org

329
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,800
client-side decorations is getting a revisit and they've posted some

330
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,360
screenshots now of different scenarios where you can have the GTK software

331
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,960
detect if you are in a client-side decoration environment and automatically

332
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,480
display those big header bars or if you're an environment perhaps it isn't

333
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,920
friendly to client-side decorations it'll drop them now and go back to a

334
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,860
more traditional look kind of on the fly this is sort of them saying all right so

335
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,640
the client-side decorations thing wasn't that well received we still think it's a

336
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,000
good idea we'll implement it in certain scenarios and we'll automatically remove

337
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,600
it in other scenarios and if you're watching the video version I'm showing

338
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,520
you some screenshots right now it kind of it's kind of a kind of like what we've

339
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,000
seen with gnome itself when they make these dramatic changes there's a ton of

340
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,600
blowback and then you start seeing things like classic mode and extensions

341
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,120
that kind of bring back functionality now you're seeing this people were

342
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,160
really responding like whoa whoa whoa whoa if GTK is going off crazy like this

343
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,560
I don't know if I want to be using this this seems like it's something just for

344
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,920
gnome and now this seems to be them coming back and say all right guys well

345
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,800
look no we still want you to use this in other environments wimpy you're you're a

346
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,680
mate guy I'm a tag guy you're using GTK and all kinds of different environments

347
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,920
is this good news in your perspective it is because it's gonna save us a ton of

348
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:32,360
work really how so well at the moment we've had to put some patches in to kind

349
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:36,320
of adapt client-side decorations because there are ways to override them at a

350
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,440
system level but they can still be overridden at the application level so

351
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,360
if you look at the new GA client-side decorations I mean actually it's quite

352
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,680
it's quite nifty the way they've integrated the menus into the title

353
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:54,320
bars there but you can't override those at a system level because it's kind of

354
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,720
intrinsic to the way the application is designed to work now but this approach

355
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,640
it does mute the critics and it does make GTK a platform that anyone can use

356
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:12,440
and and certainly go some way to silence in the critics saying that GTK is sort

357
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:18,200
of becoming a lib no library Popey did we just jump on him too soon were they

358
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,020
gonna do this all along when we just didn't let white out to see the final

359
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:28,280
version maybe maybe they've seen what Apple are doing with Yosemite and

360
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,440
they're following up and very quickly posting what what they've been planning

361
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,400
all along I'm sure you think so so why not come out from the very beginning and

362
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,880
say we're working on this but for non gnome 3 environments we're gonna have an

363
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,200
answer for you soon why not say that from the beginning there under no

364
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,960
obligation to do that it's an open source project you know there's no

365
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,520
there's no reason why you know you stamping your feet and demanding that

366
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,200
they tell you what their future plans are means that they have to do that but

367
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,720
doesn't this doesn't this go to what we have so often see in the community where

368
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,400
there's this abrasive sort of way of presenting the future from the known

369
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,200
project and then the community reaction says oh once again

370
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,760
gnome is shoving something down our throats and doesn't care what we have to

371
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,000
say there's just like this visceral reaction that you see on on reddit and

372
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and and on on on discussion forms all over the web and it's kind of like if

373
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,920
they would just come out and maybe communicate slightly differently and say

374
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,600
our long-term plan is to solve something for everyone I do wonder if maybe those

375
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,280
initial reactions wouldn't be so much oh gnome is once again cramming something

376
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,600
down our throats I think if no spend all their time responding to reddit and the

377
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,400
rest of the gallery then they wouldn't actually get anything done I think I

378
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,520
think they're doing the right thing yeah and they definitely are I mean it sounds

379
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,520
like it's a good change regardless of they're gonna do it all along or if

380
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,640
this isn't about face this seems like a great change it's it's one of these

381
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,400
things to where I look at and go this is perfect because I really genuinely have

382
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,480
some GTK applications that I'm gonna use regardless of what desktop I'm on and

383
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,720
this has been a problem and you we've seen some of those horrible screenshots

384
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,320
of like archiver on cinnamon before cinnamon supported client-side

385
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,320
decorations really much better well they had to start somewhere as well true yeah

386
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,260
I suppose so I suppose they could have done this from the beginning but yeah I

387
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,940
suppose so all right even if it wasn't their idea that I mean like if there if

388
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:24,840
it wasn't their long-term solution and then you know they meant to just do what

389
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,920
they did and then people had backlash isn't it kind of a good sign that the

390
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,760
known project is showing that the listening and they're actually trying

391
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,880
to solve the problem that they are you know being informed about yeah that's a

392
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,520
great point is it does seem like either way they're listening more I have to go

393
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:47,080
ahead I have a house for no sorry to be fair to the name developers they've

394
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,160
communicated quite well what their intentions were with regards to

395
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,800
client-side decorations with the development community through through

396
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,280
their blogs and through their documentation effort and although it

397
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:03,440
wasn't received with open arms let's say through some projects that are dependent

398
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,860
on GTK the the developers that were affected by these decisions didn't throw

399
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,040
their toys out the prime and didn't get too worked up about it it was quite a

400
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:17,640
pragmatic reception and certainly from Marte's point of view in addition to

401
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:24,160
adapting to the system overrides we also abstracted some of the toolkit to change

402
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:30,780
the way that that GTK three works to suit better the style that Marte works

403
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:37,560
with but most of the backlash and vitriol that you see isn't from people

404
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:43,560
that know what they're talking about I think I think I think our favorite K

405
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,280
win developer probably was the most vocal about it and he's very technical

406
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,040
and very experienced in that area I agree that there are technical

407
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:56,480
commentators that have a point of view but the overwhelming feedback comes from

408
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,800
people that will read something that Martin has posted or other people that

409
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:07,240
know what they're talking about and then repeat bites of that about the place as

410
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,520
if they're expert on the subject and don't really know what they're what

411
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,120
they're espousing at all and it comes down to something we were we were kind

412
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,400
of discussing on the live stream on Sunday is there's a bit of sometimes it

413
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,920
happens is drive-by technologists that can come in and kind of fire shots over

414
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:29,080
this but I I kind of looking back at this now there was it was there was

415
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:34,160
certain people in the community that did very bloudly condemn it and what we

416
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:39,800
don't know now is if it was that vocal pushback that maybe for before I get on

417
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,480
Martin for going to the blog and going to Google Plus and sort of ramping up

418
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,640
sort of an anti client-side decoration campaign perhaps it was that very effort

419
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,840
that sort of convinced the known project to make these changes we don't know well

420
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:59,280
when when GTK 3.11 which was one of the development cycle it was one of the

421
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,960
point releases for 3.11 I know that a couple I think three of the developers

422
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,640
from the Marte project we're talking to some of the developers from name and

423
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,720
explaining some of the the difficulties we're seeing and and how it it could be

424
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,920
better implemented yeah and we and we already got a feeling that they were

425
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,080
like yeah okay we're going to address this in a later release somewhere and

426
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,240
we're good we're going to change the way that this is applied so you know from

427
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,840
our point of view we kind of knew that that wasn't a step down as such but a

428
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,680
change of direction to be more accommodating to other projects yeah and

429
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,280
I also I also noted when they originally started talking about the whole

430
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,440
client-side decoration thing it was couched with a lot of this is in

431
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,760
development this is a work in progress this is something we're moving towards

432
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,960
what do you think about us putting the buttons here you know there wasn't like

433
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,360
it wasn't it wasn't an ironclad this is how it will be designed it was this is

434
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,560
what we're thinking about I remember specifically like blog posts or like

435
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,440
here's a mock-up of how we could do it and it was very I actually think it is

436
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,160
an indication of how the gnome project has changed you're not just with

437
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,980
client-side decorations but really starting with about gnome 3.10 the way

438
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,720
they have been communicating their future changes to me is much more open

439
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,560
it's much easier to like sort of grok some of the new stuff coming towards

440
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,840
gnome and I think they're firing a lot better on the communication cylinders

441
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,400
now and I think it's definitely improving yeah I mean I think this is

442
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,360
another another thing another bump in that direction another another trend

443
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,240
bump you could call it definitely been my experience it's good news it's good

444
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,600
news everybody and also it's good news because arch and gnome are gonna take

445
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:37,880
over Linux in a couple of years so I mean what all right hey we have some

446
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:44,000
OSCON stuff to follow up on got some more goodies from OSCON and both that

447
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,080
Eric and Noah went down there with me so I I have a few photos I wanted to show

448
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,160
so if you're watching the video version you can grab you can just watch that or

449
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,080
I will have the link to the photo album in the show notes you don't worry we're

450
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,040
not gonna do like a big slideshow but I just want to talk a little bit about our

451
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,080
trip and say it right off the top a really special thank you to Noah Noah

452
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,600
went all out for this trip not only did he and his family fly out here a week

453
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,400
before they needed to be out here for a wedding they were going to but they also

454
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,880
rented an SUV so that way they could haul our butts around Noah FedExed out

455
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,480
camera gear and microphones like overnight so this is no and I driving

456
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,840
down Noah took me down to the train station where we where Eric and I went

457
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,540
to the yes what is it a Union Station Eric that is King Street Station in

458
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:34,240
Seattle Kings we went down to King Street Station which was really nice

459
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,960
riding the train is so much more chill than riding on the plane because you

460
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,600
just walk up like there's a there's a gal at the front she's like what where

461
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,760
are you going and I tell you where I'm going all right go sit over there and

462
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,640
then they they announced over a horrible speaker when it's time to get on the

463
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,360
train and then you just walk up to the train and get on after like like stamp a

464
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,320
thing and you go past a guy so it's pretty casual because you can just you

465
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,920
know it's like I don't know you just like we just walk right up and get on

466
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:08,280
there the train was nice too I think this is underrated way to travel and

467
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,880
plus you get a nice view the whole way you go Eric got the the seat view both

468
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:18,440
ways both ways okay did you get any good pictures you know I did I should

469
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:23,080
probably post those but I got some great views like the train goes right under

470
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,600
the Tacoma Narrows bridge which is a huge suspension bridge in Washington

471
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,200
State and it's I got some really neat pictures of that I got some pictures

472
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,200
like what Chris is showing on the livestream right now the st. John's

473
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:44,080
bridge in it turns out Eric is like a walking Wikipedia of road trivia highway

474
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,680
and bridge trivia out the wazoo it's ridiculous which makes it when I was

475
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,480
picking you up from the train station what about that what about what about

476
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,280
so here's Eric and I at the train station where we had an opportunity to

477
00:33:54,280 --> 00:34:01,760
spend about an hour and 45 minutes well to be fair it wasn't really Noah's

478
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,960
fault so I mean to give Noah credit so Eric and I we get on a train right and

479
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,200
we're all being super like cash train has Wi-Fi the whole way down there so

480
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,880
that's really nice and easy it's kind of spotty but you get Wi-Fi meanwhile Noah

481
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,760
and the family unbeknownst to us are going through like a special like

482
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,800
welcome to Washington hell trip where like the mall they go to gets evacuated

483
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,840
when all they want to do is just eat and pee so then Noah drives the whole

484
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,760
family from Seattle down to Portland Oregon while Eric and I are on a train

485
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:34,520
then he goes an hour yeah and then he goes to pick us up and Google Maps sends

486
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,480
them like 25 miles in the wrong direction oh no well see that's your

487
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,040
first problem you weren't using ways this is the night before I saw and so

488
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,200
Noah's like Noah finally after a while like I'm like I first I don't want to I

489
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,480
didn't want to bug him because I wasn't sure like you know he's got the whole

490
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,160
family maybe you know like there's some stuff to settle before he leaves you

491
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,120
know so I'm like about 45 minutes go by and I'm like so how's it going and he

492
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,200
like writes me back he's like just so you know man this is nowhere near the

493
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,080
hotel I'm like oh dude it's like seven minutes from the hotel what are you

494
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,200
talking about so then we start like sending each other map screenshots back

495
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:12,640
and forth to compare notes all over vibrate no I got a nice tour of the

496
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,040
Portland Oregon area let's well I think he was driving too fast to see most of

497
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,680
it to be honest with yeah when he got there he came to a screeching halt yeah

498
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:32,760
like when he got there that the vehicle smelled like burned rubber cuz he was

499
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,640
funny that what put us behind the curve to begin with was we wanted Indian food

500
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:44,080
and we went to the Indian food that was probably so we go to this we go to go to

501
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,120
this restaurant and the restaurant is closed so we go down to this mall which

502
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,560
is nothing like ten blocks in in a different direction then yeah somebody

503
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,200
pulled the fire alarm so they evacuated the mall the funny thing was on Sunday

504
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,680
when we got back into Seattle we went back to eat to eat Indian food again and

505
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,320
we found an Indian restaurant literally like three blocks from where that mall

506
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:10,040
was go figure yeah yeah so we stayed at the Red Lion Hotel and which was nice

507
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,920
because it was only it was you know five minutes walking distance from the

508
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,280
convention center not a great hotel you can see here this is my curtain this

509
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,480
looks like something that Sound of Music would make dresses out of they were like

510
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,040
just it was like really distracting but you know what was what was chiefly

511
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,600
important OSCON day one I figure I'm in Linus Torvalds territory it's safe to

512
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:35,160
rock socks and sandals I proudly rock socks and sandals at OSCON it's super

513
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,880
comfortable it's the way to go and then we got some food there's a Noah rocking

514
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,880
his Google glass and Eric taking phone calls there at the food table making

515
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,000
business deals of course yeah and we saw one of the coolest things at OSCON what

516
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,760
was the hardware alley and I got some more of that in a little bit but this

517
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,680
here is Noah do you remember the details of this split keyboard where the guy had

518
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,360
handwritten all of the info and they felt so good yeah so essentially it's a

519
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,440
customizable keyboard so you can take the keys and you can arrange them any

520
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,520
which way you want it you have a picture of the metal one I know that board those

521
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,200
keys those keys what he's showing on the wooden they're not stuck in that pattern

522
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,280
like you can slide those keys any which way you want there's not in the picture

523
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,800
it almost looks like there's their specific spots where they have to go but

524
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,760
they can put them anywhere on the board yeah I'm somehow they work yeah they're

525
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,200
really neat and they feel really good we saw some custom like little arm Game

526
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,240
Boy like machines the guys were super excited about making them aren't we know

527
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,800
yeah yeah we saw the open so I think I had a little bit I have the open source

528
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,640
laptop and of course Erica Noah so there's Noah's camera and there's Eric

529
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,200
they're getting set up because we had an interview with Krista Bona I think that

530
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,400
was one of our highlights of the trip was getting to chat with Krista Bona and

531
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,480
yeah it's funny man because when you walk up to these places the way the

532
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,060
conversation goes is who are you who are you with if they don't recognize you how

533
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,720
many subscribers do you have and then you give them the answer and either you

534
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,640
pass the test or you fail the test and and thankfully we passed the test yeah

535
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,940
and here's a here's a great example like Zen you know the virtualizer they had a

536
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,920
booth and they had well funny enough they had like an iMac mounted in the

537
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,720
booth and then they had like Linux stuff being displayed on the iMac but they had

538
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,800
a pretty cool booth to sit at and Linode was there rocking some cloud hosting

539
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,720
information and then we saw like all kinds of funny like makeshift things

540
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,480
like there was this was a four node cluster that was built out of these

541
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,280
little machines Red Hat had a pretty good booth we stopped we'll have a

542
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,800
we'll have a chat with one of them here in just a minute there's me rocking the

543
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,060
OSCON boy towards the mid bit of the first day I was starting to feel a

544
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:43,240
little ragged because it's a lot of walking around it's hot but then you

545
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,200
know we started to see the fun side of OSCON like this giant chess set that

546
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,600
they have on the floor there there was a ping-pong table and then we got to chat

547
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,040
with Karen from the Software Freedom Conservancy which was exciting because

548
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,100
she's really like she's passionate so that got us all fired up again and then

549
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,440
we walked around we saw the open source laptop this is such a cool I mean I

550
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,440
think no is this maybe your favorite stop that we did which the hardware

551
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,040
laptop yeah the hardware laptop with these stegnographers keyboard that you

552
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:15,080
wanted to switch to over Devora it's really cool I'm not gonna deny that but

553
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,720
I have to say my favorite booth which I don't even think we have pictures of

554
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:24,680
what was the orange of s the blue right the appetize social that that right now

555
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,580
we don't have any shirt we don't have any pictures from that but they're

556
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:32,600
working on a really cool open source post to all social networks at once kind

557
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,000
of like your hootsweets out there but totally open source and free that you

558
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,440
can self host so if you're a company and you you have to manage a social media

559
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,280
account like a lot of distros do and things like that they have essentially

560
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,520
just go to their github repo check it out and you throw it up on your own

561
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,160
server and now you can you can manage multiple social networks with this one

562
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,960
open source suite and they also do other stuff like a parallel file system and

563
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,000
all kinds of other stuff but that was what we were really excited about I'm

564
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,400
gonna look at the file system too it looks actually pretty cool there's

565
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,920
another shot of the open source laptop really neat I just love a wood laptop I

566
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,840
mean it's it's no macbook air or ultra pro but it's you know it's pretty sweet

567
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,720
and the guy was really passionate talking about the different hardware and

568
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,280
stuff Noah got a great interview with Simon St. Lauret we're gonna have that

569
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,280
here in just a minute he is a senior editor at O'Reilly and also one of the

570
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:24,320
chairmen's of OSCON and then Noah drove us back I think this is almost it right

571
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,480
here here's the oh this was cool I really liked this at the Libre office

572
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,720
booth up on the projector they had in a Libre office document projected up on

573
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,320
the screen guess what this morning the UK government announced that they're

574
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:40,040
standardizing on ODF the same more the same format Libre office uses natively

575
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,840
that was a pretty fun thing to be there to see them celebrate that when that was

576
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:49,120
announced so they were so excited about that I cannot tell you I mean we had

577
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,960
like a five-minute conversation before I drug you guys over so we could get an

578
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:57,320
air view of them yeah so it was so excited and why Noah was talking to the

579
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,560
Libre office folks I was talking to one of the guys from the software

580
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,440
conservancy they the one of the developers of PHP my admin and I was

581
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,440
like man I love your project thank you for making it easy for my clients to

582
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,160
back up their sequel databases like you've enabled them to use my SQL thank

583
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,720
you that's kind of neat that's just who you bump into while you're there and we

584
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:23,440
just start chatting up again I love the Linux action show also Michael Dexter

585
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,960
of the Portland Linux Unix group yep he was pointing us in the right

586
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,160
direction for people to be interview I just want to give him props to nice

587
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,400
such a good such a nice guy it's always fun he's always at these events that I

588
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,920
go to and it's so great to bump into him because it's like seeing an old friend

589
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,480
and it was also he also got us to hook up when we did the live stream of the

590
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,940
Linus Torvalds chat at the Portland Linux users group so let's get to we

591
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:51,160
interviewed Ruth I think her name was from Pi Dora and you know this is a

592
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,200
really fascinating project to see Fedora get into the whole arm space get into to

593
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,000
get into making a serious distribution for the Raspberry Pi they're writing

594
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,640
books about it now they're really getting they're getting really serious

595
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:04,080
about it so I want to talk about that but first let's thank our next sponsor

596
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,120
on the Linux unplugged show and that's the awesome folks over at Ting Linux

597
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:13,080
dot ting.com Linux dot ting.com will get you $25 off your first device if you've

598
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,200
already got a device well good news you can bring that over to ting check their

599
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,320
BYOD page and they'll just give you a $25 credit everywhere I went when I was in

600
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,640
Portland I was rocking LTE coverage and even more to the point which is really

601
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,320
unique is while I was on the floor at OSCON I was able to take pictures and

602
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,480
send them back to Angela who was sitting back at jbhq and then posting like the

603
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,200
guys are on the floor interviewing Chris Tabona the guys are on the floor

604
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,000
interviewing Chris Christian Hellman like all of that was happening while I

605
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,880
was on the floor and actually be able to get LTE or sometimes 3G depending on

606
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,360
the because it's just crazy in these conventions I had to give mad props to

607
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:54,000
ting Linux dot ting.com go find out why ting is awesome here the highlights no

608
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,240
contract so no early termination fee and you only pay a flat six dollars per

609
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,720
month no data caps no minutes you have to use up or don't get to take advantage

610
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,920
of it's just what you use every single month add it up six dollars for the line

611
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,160
and then whatever the tax man's got to take to give yourself a little taste go

612
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,000
over to Linux dot ting.com and click on that savings calculator now for purposes

613
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,560
of demonstration enter in exactly what you actually use not what you pay for

614
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:26,280
right because which one of the hardest things about switching to ting is you

615
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,680
have to kind of change the way you think about wireless you don't have to buy like

616
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,800
a certain set amount of minutes that you might use in a certain set amount of

617
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,680
data that you may or may not use or text messages you only pay for what you use

618
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,920
and it it's if you think about the way the mobile industry should have been

619
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,400
structured this is it what ting has done is hit the reset button and it makes so

620
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,920
much more sense once you kind of change the way you think about things so I've

621
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,520
plugged in actual usage here so minutes used per month let's say 400 that's kind

622
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,640
of that'd be very generous for me but let's say it's 400 text messages 500 I

623
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,760
say that's probably about right megabytes use let's say this month I met

624
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,160
you know I'm about three gigs so I'll just put three gigs in there now before

625
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,480
I switch to ting my bill would have easily been a hundred and forty nine

626
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,000
ninety nine before taxes one forty nine ninety nine US if I click calculate

627
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,920
savings I can see that if I would switch to ting over a two-year period I would

628
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:23,680
save $1,919 linux.ting.com go try out the savings calculator put your info in

629
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,720
there and see how much you would save and see why switching to ting might just

630
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,880
make a lot of sense for you plus no old customer service means when you got a

631
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,040
problem they're gonna solve it for you they're awesome dashboard also means that

632
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,920
if you want to take care of it yourself you can because their dashboard makes

633
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,680
sense and yet it's extremely powerful linux.ting.com and a really big thank you

634
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:48,360
to ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged it was it was awesome having LTE down

635
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:52,440
there okay so let's cover some of our first interviews this was this first

636
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,200
one just something fun didn't quite fit into the show but one of my favorite

637
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,160
booths at OSCON was the github booth yeah the github booth because they had

638
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:06,120
an actual DJ and they weren't like crazy with the music it was it wasn't too loud

639
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,840
but it was good like you knew when you were near the github booth because they

640
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,080
had music going so I chatted with one of the guys from github I said okay why

641
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:18,000
github and music so I noticed here that you have a very handsome looking DJ booth

642
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,240
over here is github gonna be rocking music all day all day so tonight during

643
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,000
the booth crawl you'll find us we're basically blowing the place out and

644
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,160
we'll throw out the breaks and whatnot today yeah that's awesome so why github

645
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,080
and music we have a lot of creative people at github you know that's one of

646
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,880
the attributes we hire for so music is one of the parts of our culture we have

647
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,800
a lot of code-based parties around the city and whatnot so yeah and it was it

648
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,960
was pretty cool it was pretty neat to have it's the different take on every

649
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,480
every booth that's major tries to do something interesting so we had to stop

650
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,640
by the red hat booth and Ruth was there and Ruth has talked to Noah in the past

651
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,960
in fact Ruth and Noah are like best buds like they just started catching how you

652
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,200
doing Ruth oh I'm good Noah like they just started catching up like old pals

653
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:07,880
so Noah talked to Ruth about piedora and all those goodies at OSCON we're here

654
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:13,640
walking around at OSCON 2014 here in Portland Oregon and we ran into Ruth

655
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,080
from the red hat project how are you Ruth I'm great how are you doing all

656
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:22,360
right now Ruth I had the opportunity to hear you a couple months ago talk about

657
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,520
the Raspberry Pi and all the interesting things I think you had a you had a suit

658
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,680
that you had you had you had made you know it was all powered by Raspberry Pi

659
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,320
now I understand that there are some major changes that have come out

660
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:37,080
hardware-wise on the Raspberry Pi can you tell me a little bit about that yeah

661
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:41,600
just last week they released the model B plus and the reason it's not model C is

662
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,080
because it's still the same chip the same RAM and all of that but it has

663
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:49,040
some significant improvements there are four USB ports now instead of just two

664
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,440
the corners are rounded you know some easy things like that it's a nicer form

665
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,680
factor the composite jack is gone the option is still there through the audio

666
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:00,560
jack but it just kind of streamlines things the other significant changes

667
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,800
they've switched it from an SD card to a micro SD card and the biggest thing

668
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,280
about that for me is the SD card holder was plastic and if you depending on your

669
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,800
case or what you were doing it had a tendency to break off and so the the new

670
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,320
micro SD card holder is metal which is a really nice improvement that's

671
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,760
outstanding now does that SD card does it still stick out a little bit or with

672
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,840
micro SD is it completely encased it looks like I don't have one yet they've

673
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,560
only been out for about a week and of course they pretty much instantly sold

674
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,520
out they're getting easier to come by now but it looks like it's gonna be

675
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:32,920
flush up in the system and not have that that piece sticking out yeah that's one

676
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,160
thing that always bothered me particularly when you're trying to

677
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,880
deploy a Raspberry Pi as an appliance base you know device where you don't

678
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,840
want it to be so much hackery as you want it to be you know look more

679
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:46,120
professional now on that note I wanted to ask what some people would say that

680
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,200
the Raspberry Pi is really primarily meant as a learning tool and not really

681
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,160
meant for anything remotely related to production even though many people are

682
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,760
says the guy with Google Glass on his face using I think I even saw maybe a

683
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,800
year ago or so somebody was using it in in in biomedical for a biomedical

684
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,520
purpose so what what's your opinion I mean can the Raspberry Pi be used as a

685
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:09,360
serious production tool the Raspberry Pi was designed for education that is its

686
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,520
original intent it was inspired by the BBC micro which was a computer back in

687
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,160
1981 that was designed for educational use but that said the reason we all love

688
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,600
it is because it is so infinitely useful and the new model B plus has 40 GPIO

689
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:27,000
instead of the old 26 you can do so many things with it and on top of that it's

690
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,120
cheap and so it's not the fastest it's not the greatest there's so many other

691
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:35,320
of these small boards but a lot of them are 80 or 90 dollars and the pie is 35

692
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,640
dollars and that makes it infinitely useful and so if it meets the needs of

693
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:42,560
those projects and sure it's perfectly sufficient for all sorts of things as

694
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,280
long as you have the right power as long as you have the right power can you tell

695
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,480
me so you've you've spent a lot of time looking and not only doing your own

696
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,320
projects but looking at what other people have done with Raspberry Pis if I

697
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,320
were to ask you what's the first coolest project that comes to mind what would

698
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:01,560
you say I think my favorite is still the bilingual functional r2d2 that thing is

699
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,560
so awesome and it's it's a year or two old now but it's still one of my

700
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,600
favorite projects and I think part of it is that a guy made it for his

701
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,480
girlfriend he decided to make this life-size functional takes commands in

702
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,600
Japanese and English r2d2 and then she married him so clearly it was a

703
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:21,240
successful project you you obviously you work for Red Hat and I understand that

704
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,680
that Fedora has a distribution that runs on the Raspberry Pi is there anything

705
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,720
you can tell me about Pi Dora specifically my favorite thing about

706
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,120
Pi Dora and and I tell people obviously as I work for Red Hat and I work on

707
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:36,400
Fedora a lot Fedora and Pi Dora are my preferred distributions but when you're

708
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,560
working with the Raspberry Pi you should choose the distro that most suits your

709
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:43,700
needs but my favorite thing about Pi Dora to that end is that so many of the

710
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:48,400
fun hackery projects are headless if they they're too small they don't you

711
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,520
know they run away from you they don't have a monitor attached and so my

712
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:55,200
favorite fun Pi Dora fact is that you never have to connect it to a monitor at

713
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,400
all if you add this little file when you flash the SD card you can have it flash

714
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:02,440
the IP address out the LEDs and then it reads them out the speakers in a

715
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:07,100
delightful British accent voice out the speakers huh yeah I knew about the

716
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,280
lights I knew that the lights flash but I didn't know about the speakers now is

717
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:14,080
that something that's something that that script is specific to Pi Dora I

718
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,940
believe that you can't you can grab the files off of github and I think you

719
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,900
could probably use it I've never tried using a distro why would I why would I

720
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:26,280
use something besides right why why ever straight from Red Hat so people wanted

721
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,560
to find out more about the Raspberry Pi or about your projects with the Raspberry

722
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:36,200
Pi or about Pi Dora where could somebody go for Pi Dora you would go to Pi Dora

723
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,960
PID ORA dot CA that is the site for Pi Dora for Raspberry Pi stuff Raspberry Pi

724
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,840
dot org if you're interested in other Red Hat community projects besides Pi

725
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:50,120
Dora herbicides fedora rather community dot Red Hat comm is our place for all of

726
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,920
the Red Hat upstream community projects well thank you so much for taking time

727
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:59,920
to speak with the truth Oh pi Dora that's cool that was a cool

728
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,200
interview no I'd like to hearing about my door haven't followed that much the

729
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,400
other interview that Noah managed to grab right on our second day right

730
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,160
outside the opening of the Expo Hall and this is a little behind the scenes

731
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:18,880
Simon's who Noah got to interview it was a great big thinker in the community

732
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:25,440
Simon st. laureate he's Simon STL on Twitter he's senior editor at O'Reilly

733
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:31,760
he's one of the chairpersons of OSCON and so Noah being like instinctually the

734
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,480
great interviewer that he is is like I know what I'm gonna do we didn't even

735
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,120
discuss it we were just on the same wavelength like we were just sharing the

736
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:42,800
same brain wavelength Noah's like this is the chairman I'm gonna set this up as

737
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,040
the opening interview we'll roll this as the first interview in the Linux action

738
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:50,160
show it's gonna be great it'll be the setup and you'll hear Noah do a great

739
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,640
job of setting it up as like we're here at OSCON and right outside the Expo Hall

740
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,880
about to go in and right in the interview the guy kind of blows it and

741
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:00,880
what I love is if you watch Noah's face you can see Noah's like god damn it I

742
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,040
worked really hard on that all right so here is Simon st. laureate a great chat

743
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:11,600
and a thinker welcome to OSCON 2014 we're here right outside the Expo Hall

744
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:16,060
where many exciting things are about to happen outside here we have Simon who

745
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:20,300
you are affiliated directly with O'Reilly the company that is putting on

746
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,680
OSCON thank you so much for taking time to be here with us today how are you I'm

747
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,920
great it's the show's about half over everything's going smoothly the pieces

748
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,640
are coming together outstanding so tell me a little bit about what it is that

749
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,840
you do for O'Reilly and what and I know this might be a loaded question but what

750
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,960
exactly took to get OSCON to come together okay so most of what I do

751
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,920
historically has been editorial so I've been an editor I started out bringing in

752
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:49,600
books I focus on a couple of different areas but mostly these days it's web

753
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:55,280
stuff I'm also co-chair of our fluent conference which is the web show I so I

754
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,200
have two shows that fluent I have OSCON and then I'm also helping us figure out

755
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,560
what stories we should be telling about the web whether it's in print or in

756
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:11,360
conferences or online so that yes there are many things there OSCON is special

757
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:16,240
for me and that it goes outside of my usual boundary zones this works really

758
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:21,440
well that I have two co-chairs Sarah and Matthew make that much easier and we

759
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,600
also are trying to connect things to more of the stuff we're doing internally so

760
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:30,720
the web stuff I know really well this stuff beyond that I know less and less

761
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,560
well but there are also pieces that make me really excited so we mix it up so

762
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,760
tell me a little bit how the web connects to to to OSCON I mean I you

763
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,160
know there's it's not it's not it's not necessarily live coverage of OSCON or

764
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,340
anything like that right it's so the web the web is sort of the background in

765
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:50,280
lots of the talks here people are doing you know Python this or PHP this and the

766
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:54,200
result is a web app we have we have a track that does cover front-end stuff

767
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,820
but it's a fairly small part of it because of the historic programming

768
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:03,760
languages and the open source in general is really compatible with the web but

769
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,760
you know a different thing so that it's sort of a piece of it we have a lot of

770
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:12,240
we have a lot of things that are more specifically programming we also are

771
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:17,080
starting to get really into the open hardware stuff and we're also there's a

772
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:20,880
lot there's a lot that you can do at a conference that hasn't been done enough

773
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,680
yet with like what we're calling geek lifestyle right now so you know

774
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,400
combining these different pieces to look at the way we we live in a different way

775
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,540
so I would consider myself in the truest sense the word to be a geek tell me a

776
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:37,200
little bit about this geek like lifestyle it's it's varied year by year

777
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:43,000
and it's a it's a very flexible category we it could be everything from home

778
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,720
automation there was actually a great talk a few years ago on garden

779
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:51,560
automation it involved like making sensors and then the the speaker was a

780
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,200
Linux kernel developer so everything was in C++ and you know using that to

781
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:00,280
control garden hoses you know it's become more normal I mean the nest

782
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,640
obviously is doing a lot of these things and we're seeing these things happen

783
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:11,000
it's still people at OSCON still tend to be a few years ahead of what's normal

784
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,160
out there so we try to bring in as much of that as we can so and as I've walked

785
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,920
around I've certainly seen a couple of those booths I mean they had the open

786
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,200
hacker laptop you know it's absolutely fantastic and projects like that you

787
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,760
know just it really just lights a spark in my eye right but one of the things

788
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,720
that I guess I was a little disappointed with and maybe you can speak on is why

789
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:32,220
at a at a conference that is primarily geared towards open source do we see so

790
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:35,080
many closed source solutions we walk around about you know the operating

791
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,120
systems that some of these people using are not open source operating systems

792
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,800
I'm wondering why do you think that is and what can we do to change that so

793
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:46,760
this is a lot harder of a question to ask than it sounds when Noah asked that

794
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,440
question it almost seems natural but if you think about it this is one of the

795
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,760
chairman of a convention we're saying hey we've noticed a lot of the people

796
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,240
coming here are not necessarily practicing open source themselves in

797
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,780
some regards and I want to touch on this more in a few minutes we have an

798
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,920
interesting conversation I want to get into so listen to his answer and then

799
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,840
keep that in mind as we go forward well there are a couple of different stories

800
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:10,120
on that so one is that you know when Apple was first coming out with OS X it

801
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,920
just it was they had an open source story at the core of it there still is

802
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,480
an open source story at the core of it it's just become less and less of the

803
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:22,080
story and that and the Unix tools gave developers a sense of hey I can do this

804
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:27,320
yeah I'm shifting the other direction these days I'm running Linux at home I'm

805
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:32,080
you know moving moving further and further away from that the other thing

806
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:36,080
that's happened though less with Apple more with Microsoft is that I'm seeing

807
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:41,000
the companies that used to be these completely closed systems opening up

808
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,720
more and more and more of it so like Scott Hanselman gave a talk yesterday on

809
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:49,580
like the Visual Studio ecosystem and how that was changing I was like really

810
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:53,400
happily surprised to see that like Windows is actually like part of their

811
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,320
open source story here not as much as I'd like but they're they're coming down

812
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,720
the road with us finally that's a pretty good answer too and I something I

813
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,960
noticed too is even companies like Microsoft are integrating a lot of open

814
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:10,120
source services now and and making it more maybe it may be the right approach

815
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:14,160
is making it more making their software more accommodating to play in that field

816
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,880
so it was a pretty good answer so we'll continue on so I always look at those

817
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:22,440
things it's like a wolf babysitting your child do we really trust do we really

818
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,640
trust these companies that have been so wrapped up in proprietary closed source

819
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:29,760
software do we really trust them even if they are willing to venture out into

820
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,320
the open source world I mean is that really what we want to see or would we

821
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,240
rather see like you were talking about before you know these these real

822
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:39,280
grassroots hacker type projects where it's it's somebody doing something you

823
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,440
know themselves I'm always gonna be happy with a grassroots hacker project

824
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:48,120
unless it doesn't work but you know right the trust question is hard I mean

825
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:52,880
for me like a lot of the sting I have a natural tendency to cheer for the

826
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:58,440
underdog and when I see companies that are no longer in the powerful positions

827
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:04,680
that they used to be and they're adapting open source I feel it's odd I

828
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:09,880
feel sort of I it's not just that I'm happy that they're changing or happy

829
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,520
that they've fallen it's that they're less powerful right and that makes me

830
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:20,560
feel a little better that it's probably a nice wolf maybe yep once so much of it

831
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:25,360
comes down to you know what people think they can get away with right and even

832
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:30,720
the best companies these things can change suddenly when people change so as

833
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:35,520
power gets a little better distributed in this system I think we're going to

834
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:40,960
see more and more okay we don't have to control everything yeah well let's hope

835
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,840
that the direction moves that way because that that would be a fantastic

836
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:47,640
world I think that we'd all like to see walking around the Expo Hall you've been

837
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,800
in there what what has been your favorite present or not presentation but

838
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,240
what has been your favorite booth exhibit so far I'm really really fond of

839
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:59,400
the hardware showcase I you know I do some soldering I do make some things but

840
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,960
I've never made anything like what they're doing and the combination of

841
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:10,220
open with things you can touch and play with and you know just having the

842
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:15,520
creators there to explain what they're doing has really been the most exciting

843
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:20,180
part easily for me yeah it really is and it's a fantastic conferences is there

844
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:23,840
anyone is there any place that you would point people to or anyone you would

845
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:27,760
point people to directly if they wanted to become involved with OSCON find it

846
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,320
more information about OSCON or maybe a plea for people to join us here next

847
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:35,520
year 2015 OSCON well we're just getting started on what OSCON 2015 will look

848
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:40,480
like it'll be here we know that it'll be similar timing but the program you know

849
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,720
we'd love to get input what did you love about OSCON what didn't you love about

850
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:48,760
OSCON we're starting that conversation not quite tomorrow but pretty close to

851
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:53,160
tomorrow so we're trying to get as much lead time into figuring out what the

852
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:57,320
shape of OSCON should be before we start asking for specific proposals so by all

853
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:03,680
means let us know oscon.com is the easy place to find us but you know to contact

854
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,080
me contact our co-chairs we're just happy to have the conversation about

855
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,760
what's working what more do you want perfect well thank you so much for

856
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:16,000
taking time to speak with us we really appreciate it great thank you very much

857
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
yeah really thank you very much to Simon for joining us it was a great chat and so

858
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,680
I he touched on a lot of stuff there that I want to kind of circle back on I

859
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:29,240
know heavens you had some thoughts on the sort of Microsoft going to all of

860
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,880
these Linux and open source conventions and really trying to have a presence

861
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:36,800
there what do you think it's about well considering Microsoft has been a little

862
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:42,720
bit more they're not so desktop focused anymore and more putting a lot of their

863
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:49,080
development and money into Azure and Azure is generally for the web so node

864
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,720
is one of the big things that they focus on for their Azure platform they've

865
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:57,760
finally tasted node and how the node package manager works and they've got

866
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,640
their own little new get package manager they're starting to build their own

867
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:05,480
software repo went in Windows inside Visual Studio to get all their package

868
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,320
updates library updates all that crap yeah they're tasting open source they're

869
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:13,160
like who I see what the hell they're why everyone's starting to like this it's

870
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:17,280
got good stuff yeah in fact just recently they moved their their

871
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:22,040
TypeScript development from their sort of isolated code plex website to

872
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:26,520
github which is um you know pretty yeah they were talking about that they were

873
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:29,040
talking about how they're how they're gonna be putting more stuff on github

874
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:34,640
now it is interesting we asked them and we said so how many people at Microsoft

875
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:38,560
work in the open site I think they call it the open source division and you know

876
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:42,680
before the Nokia acquisition Microsoft has a headcount I think of around 50,000

877
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:49,600
before the acquisition and she said a hundred a hundred people at Microsoft

878
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:54,480
are working on open source now but she did she did point out she emphasized

879
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,800
that it's because in a lot of ways they're using open source in different

880
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,760
areas throughout Microsoft now so where it used to be contained to a singular

881
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,200
group now more and more of the departments and divisions of Microsoft

882
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:08,040
are looking at how they can use it so it she's like that that hundred number

883
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,760
doesn't really quite equate to anything anymore but that's the group that's like

884
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,920
their core focus is you have a budget to go to these events demo you know

885
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:19,680
interface with communities that's that's what that core group does so it's kind

886
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,880
of it's kind of an interesting deal oh I we had an interview with Krista Bona in

887
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:29,160
the Linux action show last Sunday and he touched on pretty big interview and I

888
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,680
didn't see a lot of response from the community on some of the things that he

889
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:36,360
said so I wanted to pull out a couple of quotes and then bounce it around with

890
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:41,160
our virtual lug to get your opinion on it so the first thing that the bonus

891
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:45,480
said that I thought was it's obviously it's a Google way to look at it but I

892
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,840
want to ask you guys if perhaps the concept isn't potentially worth

893
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:53,840
considering he mentioned that the fragmentation that Android now faces is

894
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:59,240
simply a problem because winners have fragmentation and the reason why we

895
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:03,840
think it's a problem is because open source itself is used to losing here

896
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,440
I'll play it but yeah Android though it's just a whole different world I mean

897
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:11,160
the thing about the billion devices that's under mentioned at Google I own a

898
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,320
during his keynote that a lot of people sort of didn't parse was that he was

899
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,520
just talking about the devices that register with Google you know that's not

900
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:22,280
counting the hundreds of millions of other devices that ship and infractional

901
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,800
shares from China you know Chinese factories you know the Amazon Kindle

902
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:30,400
fire those things are all Android too right and it's like you know this is how

903
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,120
you know that Android is really open source this is how you know that

904
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:37,200
chromium is really open source because other people ship it right and we're not

905
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,680
going oh no you can't ship it you know because we're not that company we really

906
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:44,160
shipped it under a real open source license that people could use and it's

907
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:48,040
kind of cool you know now do you think that that providing that level of

908
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:53,160
freedom also provides the ability for companies to abuse it so for example

909
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:57,160
when I bought my Verizon Samsung phone I have a lot of Verizon apps I have a lot

910
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,440
of stuff I didn't really want on the phone that isn't really part of the

911
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,800
Android experience it just Verizon wanted that stuff on it and the and and

912
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:08,120
and the ability for those OEMs to modify that operating system could be seen as a

913
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:14,360
detraction for some users right yeah I guess I mean I hate to say it but that's

914
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:18,480
a problem winners have you know you know your platforms winning when you have

915
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,160
those kinds of problems fragmentation is a problem winners have and and I think

916
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:27,800
that open source was so used to losing losing the desktop losing this losing

917
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,800
that even though we had you know something done such a great job winning

918
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:37,960
in the server that you know feeling the win in a consumer market felt like

919
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:44,040
betrayal for some people okay so let's take that on is is is the Android

920
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:48,240
fragmentation simply a result of its popularity and is maybe the reason why

921
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:53,320
we react to it as a bad thing is because open source is so used to losing that's

922
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:56,720
a pretty that's a that's a pretty big concept so before we get into that I

923
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:01,360
want to thank our last sponsor this week and that is the awesome folks over a

924
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:05,600
digital ocean a digital ocean is rocking it these days you guys go over to

925
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,960
digital ocean right now because we've got a promo code for the month of July

926
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:11,440
and I would love to represent for Linux unplugged use the promo code unplugged

927
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,760
July when you check out and you'll get a $10 credit now what is digital ocean

928
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,040
digital ocean is simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive

929
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:23,320
and easy way to spin up a cloud server and boy is that not the case they have a

930
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,840
brand new data center in London where some of the folks in our subreddit are

931
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:29,680
getting new cloud servers spun up in 21 seconds now what they're really gonna

932
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,760
say is look you can expect to have a cloud server spun up in 55 seconds

933
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,160
that's amazing and pricing plans start only five dollars a month for 512

934
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:43,480
megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one blazing fast CPU and a terabyte of tier

935
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:47,040
one bandwidth and digital ocean is data center locations in New York San

936
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:52,640
Francisco Singapore Amsterdam and London brand-new London their interface is so

937
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,760
simple and so intuitive the control panel really gives you the ability to

938
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:00,400
deploy a server in under a minute and have complete control over that it

939
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,200
doesn't feel like you have reduced functionality and the best part is they

940
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:08,560
have a straightforward API the power you just can replicate on their own on them

941
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,720
so you could have you could have an interface to the digital ocean droplet

942
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:16,400
system that is all through a bash script using their API deploying servers as you

943
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:19,880
need them scale up scale down using digital ocean infrastructure starting

944
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:23,520
only five dollars per month but when you use unplugged July you get the ten

945
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,160
dollar credit I've been talking to folks this morning about how they're setting

946
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:31,040
up own cloud 7 on a digital ocean droplet running Ubuntu 1404 and I'm

947
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:34,440
thinking I'm gonna do the same thing why not right five dollars I have my

948
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:38,520
dedicated droplet I can move it around I can back it up I can snapshot it I just

949
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:42,080
have it's it's so straightforward and that is so worth five dollars a month

950
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:45,440
for me there's other things you can use digital ocean for two that you might not

951
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,640
have thought of but because digital ocean has seen such incredible growth

952
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,320
specifically in the developer and Linux communities you're starting to see

953
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:56,440
awesome solutions built around digital ocean that are just sort of a result of

954
01:06:56,440 --> 01:07:01,560
their success in fact here's rolling your own CDN build a three continent CDN

955
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:07,060
for $25 in one hour now this isn't necessarily a digital ocean thing but

956
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,840
this is a blog post that shows you by how using digital ocean engine X and

957
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:14,960
Docker you can set up your own CDN that does distribution content all over the

958
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:19,040
world now if you're a podcaster you know if you have a podcast right now and

959
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:23,760
you're serving up your mp3 files from a single web server stop it that's a bad

960
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,640
experience for your users it's bad it's just bad all around because every time

961
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,160
somebody's downloading that mp3 file that's hanging up one of your web server

962
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,480
sessions so it's not responding to serving up a web page and also makes the

963
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,820
download slow it's just inappropriate it makes you look unprofessional but for

964
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:43,040
$25 you could set up a worldwide CDN using digital ocean droplets your end

965
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:47,480
users get their podcast faster your web servers more responsive and during peak

966
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:50,720
download times you don't have that chugga lug that happens on your web

967
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,360
server and everybody's either loading web pages or downloading mp3s for $25

968
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:58,840
and this blog post tells you how to do it you see how when you combine KVM you

969
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,640
combine an amazing interface you combine great data centers SSD drives in tier

970
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:06,620
one bandwidth and incredible value you can really start to create a whole new

971
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:10,880
class of technology digital ocean comm use the promo code unplug July when you

974
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:25,000
check out and a really really big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the

975
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,960
Linux unplugged show okay so let's uh let's kick it around to the mumble room

976
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:35,600
is is Android fragmentation simply a result of it being success I want to

977
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,540
start with you Noah since you were talking to the bone and what was going

978
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:41,600
through your head when he gave you that answer were you agreeing or were you

979
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:48,200
like this kind of sounds a little bit like spin okay so my problem with

980
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:52,600
Android I think it's I think it's one of your gripes too is that Android because

981
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:57,600
it was late to the game had to make compromises in their operating in what

982
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:03,760
they would have liked to have seen as an ideal user experience in order to cave

983
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:08,300
to what the carriers wanted and I think that makes for and yes it makes it much

984
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:12,640
more prolific than I'm sure that he says what does he say 85% or whatever of all

985
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,520
devices are running Android and that's great but it's a crappy Android

986
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:20,440
experience there's a lot of really crappy Android devices out there so I I kind of

987
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:24,080
think it's a crap answer he acknowledged to that it falls down when it comes to

988
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:29,440
the security aspect of it but the way so I want to take particular like I

989
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:34,880
actually kind of agree with it is a problem that winners have in the sense

990
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,840
that when you reach a certain mass adoption there's so many people are

991
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,640
going to start experimenting with your operating system or just going with it

992
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,800
like when I had a chat with Aaron Sigo about challenges of building the

993
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:47,280
Vivaldi tablet one of the thing he's one of the things that really stood out to

994
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:51,620
me that he said was when we talk to these manufacturers if we tell them it

995
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:55,520
needs to be Android compatible it clicks they know they know exactly what we want

996
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,520
to give us all the specs but when we tell them it needs to be Linux

997
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,160
compatible they have no idea what we're talking about right and so part of that

998
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:05,440
so you just see there's this adoption level that's through the entire stack

999
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,960
from people making software all the way down to the people assembling in it on

1000
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,920
the manufacturing line so there's just this mass adoption level where Android

1001
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,840
almost can't help but have all kinds of weird incarnations of it because it's

1002
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:20,320
almost a de facto operating system it's like it has become one of the general

1003
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:24,440
purpose platforms at least for low power devices so that part I agree with the

1004
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:28,800
part that I take issue with is I don't agree that open source is used to losing

1005
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,440
and he gave kind of a mention to well except for in the server but let's be

1006
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:37,160
honest Apache crushes the competition nginx is rock-solid there is so much

1007
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:42,520
open source technology that is winning Android itself is open source

1008
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:47,620
technology that is winning so to say that open source is used to losing I

1009
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:50,980
think that is a mischaracterization I think you could argue perhaps the

1010
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:55,040
desktop is used to losing but to say open open source is not just used to

1011
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:01,660
winning open source has won well yeah here's my perspective on it is when I

1012
01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:04,560
look at this and I've interviewed Chris before so I kind of get where his

1013
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,440
mindsets coming from he's looking at it as if I walk up to Joe blow on the

1014
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:11,160
street and say oh yeah you're really you're using an open source product

1015
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,400
they're gonna look at you with a blank stare they have no idea what you're

1016
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:17,200
talking about if you say Android or something they recognize then in fact

1017
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,360
you've actually made that connection so I think he is talking about the desktop

1018
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:24,760
and I also think he's also expanding on the the branding the recognition do

1019
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:27,880
people understand that they're benefiting from this thing called open

1020
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:34,080
source people don't I understand I agree if we're only talking about Linux

1021
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:38,720
enthusiasts who critique Android but in reality it's not just Linux users who

1022
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,040
critique some of these problems with Android but it's actually the entire

1023
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,640
technology industry who really you know doesn't even follow the Linux desktop

1024
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,200
necessarily so I don't know if that's influencing the way they see it I do

1025
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:51,640
agree that you know maybe we're not used to seeing what success looks like in

1026
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,920
some regards on the desktop I don't I think it's also how we define success I

1027
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,640
mean I think geeks and casual folks definitely when it comes to technology

1028
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:02,800
we just do we define success very differently I use my myself and my

1029
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,240
mother-in-law as an example for her success in technology is when the

1030
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:09,720
button she pushes on the remote works properly and for me it's when I saw this

1031
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:13,920
amazingly complex problem that took a lot of work to do you know so usually I

1032
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,880
think it just differs from person to person all right well I know the mumble

1033
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:19,680
room has a couple other thoughts on that but I want to move on because here was

1034
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:23,520
Chris's response to why fragmentations actually gives Android its edge and he

1035
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,920
thinks yeah okay if we accept there's fragmentation I'm not even sure if it's

1036
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,800
a problem and the thing is if you look at the the Verizon builds if you look at

1037
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,480
the you know it's funny actually I I don't want to sound like I'm betraying

1038
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:38,760
my people but I actually prefer the Moto X build to the stock Nexus build right

1039
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:41,960
now because it has this really cool feature where you can shake it and take

1040
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:45,000
a picture yeah you know so you don't have to worry about unlocking it in

1041
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
other ways so I can whip it out of my pocket while shaking like you know look

1042
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,800
I'm having a seizure but it's fine though and then I can take my picture

1043
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:56,040
really fast and I really like that feature and I really like the the

1044
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,640
Bluetooth trust feature in the Moto X and those are things that Motorola

1045
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,720
brought to it and Motorola is not part of Google anymore so I'm not just

1046
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:07,640
kissing corporate butt here and and I think that it's not wrong to try to

1047
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:11,960
excel by adding new things to an operating system now I would hope I would

1048
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:15,960
love if those are open source and brought back into the platform or they

1049
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:19,320
were available through an app or whatever I can accept that so he's saying

1050
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:22,720
you look sometimes the way you get some of these new innovations is by having

1051
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:26,440
different people try stuff and don't we see that in just Linux distros itself

1052
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:31,800
you know you look at things that have come through like different installers

1053
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,680
where one distribution really lands on a good way to do an install and you see a

1054
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:38,280
lot of other distributions pick that up or things like that so sometimes they're

1055
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:42,840
in the fragmentation there can be sort of this organic slow evolution of a

1056
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:49,080
consensus so that I can buy on to but he goes on to kind of say you know if you

1057
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:55,000
think about it in some sense on he's he calls it open source but I really think

1058
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,240
he means Linux when he's saying this he's like you guys are forking all day

1059
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:01,560
long so you got to check yourself before you come all up on Android's territory

1060
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:06,240
that's why I'm also pretty unimpressed by fragmentation arguments and that kind

1061
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:10,760
of thing and I'm like you know what you know in the open source world everything

1062
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:13,360
is a fork every time you ship a distribution every time you ship a

1063
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:17,900
program you're forking it you're putting a moment in time and you're

1064
01:14:17,900 --> 01:14:21,960
sticking with that moment right until they upgrade again or until they app get

1065
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:27,020
update or you're forking every time you do that so the measure of us as

1066
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:31,560
programmers or as app developers or as carriers or handset manufacturers is how

1067
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:34,840
we keep up with those updates how we keep bringing in the future of software

1068
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:42,520
development to our users and and that's why Android's at 84% boom so he says hey

1069
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:49,240
if you look at it this way when Ubuntu LTS 1404 ships that's a fork yeah I

1070
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,800
think he's splitting hairs on that one I can't defend that one at all I disagree

1071
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:56,680
I think that I see what he's saying but I and he is definitely including software

1072
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:00,480
in addition to Linux distribution so he's kind of using the true open source

1073
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,320
broad term but I disagree with him I think that he's wrong in stating that

1074
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:09,220
merely by putting the open an open source license on a product that you've

1075
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:12,280
instantly forked it because magically someone else is gonna come along and do

1076
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:16,440
something else with it not necessarily hmm yeah he's messing up with

1077
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:20,680
terminology a little bit same with how in programming we say that monads are

1078
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,280
the most evil or they're really weird little named things and no one ever

1079
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:29,200
likes to talk about them I kind of see his point to a sense though I've always

1080
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,120
kind of felt like when you take I've always felt like maybe one of the

1081
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:36,120
reasons rolling distributions make the most sense is because when you carve off

1082
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:40,320
a stable Linux distribution you're introducing sort of a fake structure

1083
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:44,280
where none inherently exists and this is something that just us humans do all the

1084
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,960
time we always have to go in and create structure everywhere gotta set up a

1085
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,720
system gotta gotta make sure we follow a process everywhere we go we got to

1086
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:54,760
organize it and I feel like perhaps it's kind of like trying to set up a dam in a

1087
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:57,320
river like you can hold back the water for a little bit but eventually it's

1088
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:00,480
got to break through and whenever you stable snapshot something essentially

1089
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:04,320
it's a race against time as it deviates further and further away and like if you

1090
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,120
look at what Red Hat Enterprise Linux does is they literally have to back

1091
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:12,080
port stuff from future fixes to the old stuff because they are in a sense

1092
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:16,800
maintaining their own fork of the Linux kernel in Red Hat Linux and then all the

1093
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:21,080
other stuff to Debian as well yeah all of them all of them yeah they really

1094
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:25,320
actually fork but sometimes it's just a snapshot of time instead of a fork

1095
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,720
see I think that's where you can play semantics is it a snapshot in time or is

1096
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:33,000
it a genuine fork that's maintained for like ten years and that's where Red Hat

1097
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,240
just gonna you also fit you also think about this way like for instance you know

1098
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:42,600
he was talking about how fragmentation is a it shows how much success is a

1099
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:48,520
winner Android yeah well one thing I was thinking was that's true to a certain

1100
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:53,200
extent because if you look at Debian it's got to be the most forked yeah

1101
01:16:53,200 --> 01:17:00,040
distribution on the planet yeah and it is the biggest in terms of packages so

1102
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,880
and it's probably the biggest in terms of development as well I mean you've got

1103
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:09,360
Ubuntu it's kind of a quasi fork of it and it's got all sorts of forks of its

1104
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:15,920
own so it's yeah very true right yeah you know it's interesting it didn't it's

1105
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,480
in the full interview but one of the other things he said that jumped out at

1106
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:22,560
me as he said the way I look at all of this the way I look at Android on that

1107
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:25,880
phone the way I look at Android on Noah's Google Glass and the Android

1108
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:30,960
that's gonna be on your watch he this is the bone he says to me I see those as

1109
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:35,120
different distributions those are different distros in my world that's an

1110
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,560
interesting way I don't again I think you could play semantics there you're

1111
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,720
redefining what it means but it's an interesting way to think about it now

1112
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:46,560
the elephant in the room for Noah and I at least there was one there was one

1113
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:51,520
topic of conversation our entire trip at OSCON that really sort of dominated

1114
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,000
basically anytime we stopped to take a breather no and I would kind of turn to

1115
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:03,000
each other and and talk about the unbelievable undescribable amount of

1116
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:09,680
Macintosh laptops we saw at OSCON and yeah yeah and to give you an example

1117
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:14,120
kind of funny when we were walking up to OSCON and there's to this hallway and

1118
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:19,200
this hallway is lined with tables and chairs and every table and every chair

1119
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:23,320
had at least one or two people working on a MacBook all facing us so as we

1120
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:29,240
walked into OSCON we walked down this hallway that was end to end lined up

1121
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:36,040
with Macs and that white glowing Apple logo as we walked into OSCON and I can't

1122
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:40,520
put a I can't underscore this enough literally almost every computer there

1123
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:44,680
was a Mac now there were for sure some PCs but most of those were like at the

1124
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:49,440
registration booths provided by OSCON or like somebody's work Lenovo that they

1125
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:52,760
brought with them to the booth but more often than not I mean Colonel Linux

1126
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:57,640
jump in here with me right I mean it was unbelievable that the ratio right and so

1127
01:18:57,640 --> 01:19:01,680
here's and this is what I've been waiting the entire episode to dig in on

1128
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:07,480
it I'm sure you're this is what this is what bothers me right so we have we went

1129
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:11,340
to a convention that's called OSCON Oh the open source convention the place

1130
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:15,080
where I'm supposed to be able to go as an open source user and feel like I'm at

1131
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:19,440
home I'm at home with open source software and here is what here's what I

1132
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:24,360
took away from the conference and it's a lot like like Linux con their mentality

1133
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:28,960
is that Twitter was there for example Twitter uses I guess because they're at

1134
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:34,720
OSCON they use open source software who cares who cares I don't care what

1135
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,920
Twitter's using on the back end I cared ten years ago because I thought ten

1136
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,960
years ago that if these big companies picked up Linux and adopted it and put a

1137
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,960
bunch of money into it then it would eventually trickle down to the desktop

1138
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:48,480
and as I see that not happening it infuriates well I think you're

1139
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:52,440
conflating two things so let me back up I think think of OSCON a little bit like

1140
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:57,080
this this is something I came to it's as much as for us the community to go see

1141
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:01,720
how business is like the the end product of open source are these companies like

1142
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:04,880
everything we talk about you go there and see the end results of how they

1143
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,240
actually use it I think that's beneficial for the community itself to

1144
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:12,240
see but you can flip that around to Noah like if you noticed when we talked to

1145
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:17,040
some of these folks like we are also it's them reconnecting with the open

1146
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:21,120
source community so I think it's by going to these events like OSCON that

1147
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,920
they kind of connect back to the original roots that everything starts

1148
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,160
from so I think it's a two-way street in that regard and I kind of tip my hat to

1149
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:30,300
the OSCON folks but what I think you're the core thing you're getting at here is

1150
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:35,000
essentially supposedly here's a bunch of people making money off of open source a

1151
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,280
lot of developers were there a lot of people there from their profession and

1152
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:44,240
they're all pretty much at least I would say a ratio of 20 to 1 using max and

1153
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:50,880
probably a ratio of 7 to 10 using iPhones to Android devices and that's

1154
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:56,800
being and that's being generous on the one side but and the thing that really

1155
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:03,080
irks me is that these the companies that that benefit the most from the backs of

1156
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:07,160
the community in open source then those people that are in the community are the

1157
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:11,920
first to get shafted when when the when desktop clients come out for things like

1158
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:17,880
Netflix or Google Drive right I just I feel like you should eat your own dog

1159
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:20,440
food if you're going to come to a conference and talk about how everyone

1160
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:24,640
should use free and open source software and open source is the best use it and

1161
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:29,440
not just not just on your server and on your back end boot into it use it as a

1162
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:33,600
desktop daily here's what I think the problem is is and it comes down to a

1163
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:37,160
little bit of market dynamics so Apple just released their quarter quarterly

1164
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:41,280
results a couple of days ago by Friday or something like that their Mac sales

1165
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:49,000
grew 18% in the last quarter the rest of the entire PC industry is down 2% overall

1166
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:55,760
Apple is up 18% and everybody else on all on average is down 2% they are seen

1167
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:59,960
because honestly they're well-built machines I think they're seeing a huge

1168
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:03,320
adoption curve right now and this is a trend I've noticed over the last seven

1169
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:06,720
years as I've gone to these conferences it's more and more max and it started

1170
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,680
with some max to now it's all max it's all max in the booth it's max and in the

1171
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:16,440
users it's ridiculous and I think part of the problem is a lot of times in

1172
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:21,000
professional uses people are using Linux on the server so all they really need is

1173
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,440
an SSH session to that Linux box so they get a Mac because it's trouble-free it

1174
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:30,120
runs Netflix it runs Photoshop it's got all the commercial software all the it

1175
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,000
honestly has all the open source software too you put brew on a Mac now

1176
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,880
you got a package manager Bob's your uncle you're installing stuff from the

1177
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:39,280
command line then you SSH into your Linux box you do your development all

1178
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:43,000
day long and sublime text yeah you're happy you go home and for them they just

1179
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,840
buy this laptop it's got 10 hours of battery life it's fairly trouble-free

1180
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:50,520
and it gives them SSH right out of the box I know it sounds trivial but I

1181
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:54,800
really think that's what's selling these things and I think as a community what

1182
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,680
we've got to do is nut up and I'm not using that sexually I mean in the terms

1183
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:03,720
of like let's seriously come to a realization that our boat is sinking and

1184
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:07,880
that these people are jumping ship to the Mac like crazy but the reality is

1185
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:12,080
eventually they're gonna get bored they're gonna want something better but

1186
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:16,280
we're not there when they're ready to jump Linux runs like but on these Mac

1187
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:20,140
books these freaking Mac books are selling more than any other PC in the

1188
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:24,120
industry right now and we can't manage to get Linux working on them oh you want

1189
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:28,360
Thunderbolt go F yourself sorry oh you want a high HD a high DPI resolution

1190
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:31,400
hey it kind of works on depending on which desktop you choose oh you want

1191
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:35,040
thermal management sorry Apple has an SMC controller we can't do that we won't

1192
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,720
we won't even bother like trying to reverse engineer it obviously it's not

1193
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:44,440
an ideal solution but the problem is a huge huge number of our community is

1194
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:49,560
buying these machines and we do not as Linux have a solution to make it great

1195
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:53,060
out-of-the-box experience on these Mac books it's it's half-assed you got

1196
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:57,920
trackpad problems after sleep you have no Ethernet support you've got crappy to

1197
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,640
zero thermal management and it's still a pain in the ass to make it work in the

1198
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:05,880
first place so what are we gonna do I think the problem is actually even

1199
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,240
bigger than what you're talking about because that is assuming these people

1200
01:24:09,240 --> 01:24:13,280
want to come to Linux in the first place and the reality is I don't see a lot of

1201
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:17,840
Mac OS users complaining about their Mac OS experience and wanting to come to

1202
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,380
Linux and the the best way to get those people the best way to get those users

1203
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:24,840
is right now while they're on Windows when they're looking for something to

1204
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:28,960
jump off the instability and and and the bugginess of Windows that's the time to

1205
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,720
get these users because once we lose them to the Mac it's gonna be twice as

1206
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:36,160
hard three times as hard five times as hard to get them to come to Linux well

1207
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:40,120
there as somebody who came from Mac as somebody who came from Mac I gotta say

1208
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:44,520
what's going to might be the major driver is when they have to upgrade

1209
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:48,920
their computer every two years just to keep current software I can't I had that

1210
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:53,720
problem I was like I cannot spend that much money on computer hardware I'm

1211
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:57,200
switching to Linux because I know that I'll future-proof my machines would be

1212
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:01,600
you think the targets move right out from underneath us well I just listening

1213
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,280
to your discussion it strikes me that you know a few years ago we might have

1214
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:08,840
been having this discussion about people using Windows machines and now we're

1215
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:14,080
talking about people running Mac OS 10 on Apple hardware so is is now the

1216
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:19,440
principal target for Linux adoption the Apple Mac audience I feel like what Noah

1217
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:24,000
was worried about will apply to probably the majority percentage of people who

1218
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,280
switch however there will be still a large number let's just let's for fun

1219
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:33,960
say 20% of people who switch that are technically inclined switch switch after

1220
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:37,160
a year or two from Mac OS to Linux I don't think this is actually all that

1221
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:40,800
unusual I've seen threads about coming from Mac to Linux because people get

1222
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:45,160
bored after a while and I feel like when that happens and I for a lot of

1223
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:48,800
technically inclined people who are intellectually curious I believe that

1224
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,680
does you arrive to a point in Mac OS 10 without after that long of usage where

1225
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:57,000
you've essentially mastered the operating system and if you realize

1226
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
okay I'm now seeing the walls of the holodeck I would like a better program

1227
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,200
than this and you go look for Linux and maybe you start as a dual boot and then

1228
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:09,000
you could switch over if if we were there and ready to to supply this

1229
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,760
hardware and I think what's at the end of the day what's selling is the Mac

1230
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:17,480
book I think the Mac book air I mean Linus Torvalds use a Mac uses a Mac book

1231
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:21,240
air for God's sakes right I think this is hardware no I think he still has one

1232
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:26,400
yeah no he still uses him yeah he still has it I think he just has he just has

1233
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:30,040
like more than one machine but he also has a pixel right so I mean he's got a

1234
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:34,080
few machines but I guess what the point I'm trying to get at is I feel like the

1235
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:38,880
target like wimpy said the target has moved and we are not responding we need

1236
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:43,640
to be working like on better Thunderbolt support better hide high DPI support we

1237
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:48,320
need to get you know we need to reverse engineer the SMC controller in

1238
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,440
these Macs that way there's thermal management and then the battery life

1239
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:56,600
will be better too and all of this stuff and it definitely set off like the the

1240
01:26:56,600 --> 01:27:01,360
red alert we we have a major problem and nobody's talking about it and I guess I

1241
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:04,560
kind of also feel like until you go to one of these events and you see it for

1242
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:08,200
yourself when you go to an event filled with your peer groups and none of them

1243
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:13,840
are using Linux I mean it really it's one thing to hear about it through a

1244
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:18,600
podcast it is another thing entirely to be standing there and seeing it and

1245
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:25,840
realize oh man we have a huge problem well I would expand I think go ahead

1246
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,800
Matt go ahead oh I was gonna say one thing I would expand on and this is

1247
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:33,080
something with a wife that uses a OS 10 and actually uses a Mac that I

1248
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:36,680
experienced is the number one reason why people use Macs and she and I bet

1249
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:41,080
Angela probably attest to this as well is it's called Apple care it's not an

1250
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:45,600
extended warranty we the logic board pops because Mac logic boards are crap

1251
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:50,480
I'm sorry they are they're garbage and so but the user doesn't care because

1252
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:54,200
they know they can go to the Mac store like we did it's under Apple care she

1253
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:58,000
exchanges it they fixed the logic board didn't cost us anything took three days

1254
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:01,640
and she never missed a beat she didn't the experience was completely seamless

1255
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:05,840
her data was safe she didn't have to care the other that phrase right there

1256
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,680
the other thing especially for folks who are not technically inclined is they

1257
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:13,360
you know they really need a brand that they feel like well at least I know this

1258
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:16,840
brand puts out quality at a certain level and I don't know I don't know

1259
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:21,720
about RAM I don't know about megahertz I don't know about SSD but I know that

1260
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:26,040
Apple is known for a certain kind of machine and if I'm willing to spend the

1261
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:29,000
money I can get that and I think a lot more people are willing to spend the

1262
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,240
money than we realize because a lot of these folks now are buying a machine and

1263
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:36,640
they're using it for like five plus years so it's not a deal I mean I have

1264
01:28:36,640 --> 01:28:39,960
an old I mean I don't use it hardly but I have an old iMac that I'm running off

1265
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,600
an external hard drive the point is as people are buying these things because

1266
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:45,800
they understand the experience they don't give a flying crap if it runs on

1267
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:49,200
hamsters they know what it does they understand it they're able to wrap their

1268
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:53,320
brains around it max have now gained in global market share for 32 of the last

1269
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:57,760
thirty three quarters in a row I'm not saying they're the largest machine but

1270
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,000
I'm saying we're just ignoring them go ahead heavens no it's not even an

1271
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:06,560
experience it's a company that people can blame or sue that is the backing

1272
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:10,200
thing that will make most people or companies decide on what to use they

1273
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:15,360
just want someone to blame no one wants to get like to have the X what the hell

1274
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:21,760
the responsibility to need to own up to your own hardware that's why Apple or

1275
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:26,120
that's why a lot of companies which sell a lot of software or OS's are good that

1276
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:29,880
that's crap the reason they disagree the I completely disagree the point of it is

1277
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:33,160
that people that value their time that aren't willing to are interested in

1278
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:36,760
spending their time doing that maybe they're a chef an artist I don't know

1279
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:39,840
maybe they make music whatever it is the point is is they don't want to geek out

1280
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,080
they don't care they want that experience I've worked closely with

1281
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:46,880
Chris Perillo he'll tell you the same thing he buys these machines because of

1282
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:50,800
their experience he does he knows how the stuff works that he doesn't care you

1283
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:54,560
know Chris Fisher for example runs it because it does certain tasks well I'm

1284
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,520
not a Mac person I freaking hate them with a passion but I'm not I'm not naive

1285
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:02,800
enough to think that it's this you know we look at it from a very technical

1286
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,680
point of view and Joe average doesn't care right just don't give a rat well

1287
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:09,440
what I'm finding though and what I guess struck a chord with me because I I

1288
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:12,880
wholeheartedly agree with your assessment there Matt what what struck a chord with

1289
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:17,640
me is now we're going to OS con and and also by the way I'm coming from like a

1290
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:21,960
multi-year trend to this whole sure sure now we're going to like the geeks like

1291
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:25,760
the people writing software the people that are creating server platforms and

1292
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:29,600
you know like you go to rack space and rack space has the rack space cloud and

1293
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:33,320
they're deploying bare metal servers with core OS and everybody there has a

1294
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:41,360
MacBook yep I really don't see why that is an issue though I mean if they're

1295
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:45,360
developing open source software software I could go out in the world and say even

1296
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:51,840
if it's gpl3 and download and use I don't give two craps what they are using

1297
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:56,480
on they could be developing on Windows 8 I don't think they care either yeah I

1298
01:30:56,480 --> 01:31:01,480
think you nailed it of Apple most of the time it's like what you said before

1299
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:05,400
there because someone is they just want the ecosystem I always explained or

1300
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:10,440
tried to compare Apple to be this metaphor of being a stick or a steak in

1301
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:14,440
the ground on a chain you're on this chain and in this bubble of happiness

1302
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:17,960
that's Apple that's it's a nice environment it's a beautiful little

1303
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:22,320
bubble everything is desired or given to you and you're very happy whenever you

1304
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:27,520
want to get outside that bubble you're screwed you cannot leave that place I

1305
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,760
think why and I like I think the point that hey at least these people are

1306
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:33,680
making open source software is a valid one we should underscore that my point

1307
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:37,480
is what I want to try to begin to push on to the community at least to think

1308
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:42,880
about is if we want these people to someday switch because I would think I

1309
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:47,840
mean I as a desktop Linux user really want more desktop Linux users because

1310
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:51,400
I want more of what I need to do on Linux to be more available to me and I

1311
01:31:51,400 --> 01:31:53,920
want it more available to everybody I know kernel Linux feels the same way

1312
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:58,200
very passionately more people using Linux is better for everybody and I just

1313
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:02,200
want to win these MacBook users who are professionally technical and decide they

1314
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:05,600
do want to try something else wouldn't it be amazing if we could make that

1315
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,320
transition actually work because right now that MacBook in some ways is a

1316
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:13,040
prison they're the only other direction they have that's even kind of halfway

1317
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:18,560
supported is Windows and I think colonel Linux would actually agree with this

1318
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:23,200
assessment and that the direction to get people to begin to use Linux starts with

1319
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:26,960
the PC repair text when they come in with a broken Windows machine send them

1320
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,640
out with a Linux install if give them the option say look you're doing this

1321
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:34,480
this this and this nothing that can't be done on Linux give this a try let me

1322
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:37,000
know how it works I'll go ahead and mirror your drive with it fixed if you

1323
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,880
don't like it we'll put it back on but give this a shot that's where change

1324
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:44,040
happens we could talk about it all day long but unless we're knocking on doors

1325
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:47,800
or something you know and we've seen that way I see that on a daily basis

1326
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:50,360
exactly what you're talking about Matt but what I just posted in the chat and

1327
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:54,040
I'll reiterate it I would rather be running all software like Steam and

1328
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:57,880
Netflix and all this proprietary stuff on my Linux box I would rather have that

1329
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:02,160
flexibility then have the flexibility of running all open source programs but I

1330
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:06,600
have to do it on a Mac right so I do care I do care what those developers are

1331
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:10,880
using I do care what operating system they feel is most valuable and they

1332
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,760
think the market owns if everyone has a Mac they're gonna write software that

1333
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:18,440
works well on a Mac if they all right I think that's a completely closed-minded

1334
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:25,880
mindset to be honest with you it is a good one though if everybody's using a

1335
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:29,120
Mac and they're writing software then it's gonna work better on the Mac than

1336
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:32,600
it does on your Linux desktop and that's a valid concern don't you think

1337
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:37,400
Josh oh I always see them all around the place on most of the conferences I look

1338
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:41,220
at ice watch tons of conferences and they all have Macbooks all over the

1339
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:44,800
place well maybe apparently really good apparently we should be launching the

1340
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:48,760
Macbook action show apparently based on the demographics that I'm saying but

1341
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:55,280
stay tuned for future developments yeah go ahead but absorb on is that you know

1342
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:59,560
let's instead of just talking in circles about it what do we do to fix this and

1343
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:03,320
I was pointing out to know it's like Noah nailed it so it's like okay let's

1344
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:07,000
introduce this to our customers let's introduce this to our family members

1345
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,800
let's introduce this to people that might be interested before they take the

1346
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:15,680
Mac bill you know what I mean yeah all right hey Noah I wanted to tell folks

1347
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:18,640
maybe you could give us a little info there's this great place especially if

1348
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:22,160
you're in the Grand Forks area called AltaSpeed.com where people could find out

1349
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:25,960
all kinds information about Noah and his company in the services they provide so

1350
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:30,200
check out AltaSpeed.com give them a look I've had the pleasure of working with

1351
01:34:30,200 --> 01:34:33,840
Noah out in the field I've seen how he works with his team as somebody who's

1352
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,960
done IT contracting in the past I could tell you that I spotted a good one and

1353
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:41,680
no one his team could definitely handle it AltaSpeed.com check them out they've

1354
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:47,840
also got products available to buy there too all right the plug we go ahead I'm

1355
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:52,400
just gonna say we run every technician that works for a company runs some form

1356
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:55,880
of Linux every software piece every piece of software views runs on Linux

1357
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:59,560
and that is the primary desktop we install for any customer that comes to

1358
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:02,720
us with a PC problem yep and Noah's Noah's even like all right here's your

1359
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:06,840
work machine this is Linux you feel free to break it I don't care if you break it

1360
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:11,600
just have fun and if you break it we'll fix it together I like that yeah yeah

1361
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:16,280
all right well let's wrap it up there I just a couple of a couple of bits and we

1362
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:19,440
can maybe talk about this more in the post show too but on Sunday we're gonna

1363
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:23,640

joining this week's episode of Linux unplugged we'll see you right back here next Tuesday

1394
01:37:41,440 --> 01:38:04,000
the show cannot prosper if people listening don't tell other people about

1395
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:09,880
it I think part of the problem is that people mistake Jupiter broadcasting as

1396
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:15,120
passive entertainment that's incorrect this is active participation you are

1397
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:19,560
encouraged and in some ways like gently encouraged with a poker to get involved

1398
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:24,960
share content ask questions disagree agree share ideas and just yak in

1399
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:28,800
general do something well and I guess I kind of feel like I don't know because

1400
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,640
people see some sponsors they assume oh well they've got plenty of money they

1401
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:34,960
don't need my help and it really was like yes spread the word tell people

1402
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:38,160
about it help us grow I mean I mean I'm not you know at the end of the day we

1403
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:40,840
still make great content that's what matters but I was just a little

1404
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:45,280
disappointed because we do need to help really bad it's not like you know some

1405
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:50,000
PR yeah we need some PR help you know there's the patreon page patreon.com

1406
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,320
slash today there's funding there to help cover costs like this anything

1407
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:56,280
resharing it helps all that kind of stuff being here live you know I

1408
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:59,600
appreciate everybody who shows up live that's really great to get there get the

1409
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:02,560
instant feedback and stuff like that too so and the mumble room you know all this

1410
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:07,360
stuff is incredibly helpful so I'm very very very grateful in so many so many

1411
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:10,800
ways in so many ways I just kind of felt like this last week we went above and

1412
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:13,640
beyond and it kind of fell flat and I felt bad I take it very personally you

1413
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:17,840
know because I follow this stuff very closely what do we think of the new

1414
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:21,960
final Mozilla CEO Chris Beard the man doesn't have a beard but he's got a

1415
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:25,920
great last name he's been the Mozilla project since before what Firefox 1.0

1416
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:29,120
shipped he seems to have worked in almost every aspect of the project it

1417
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:33,560
seems to be a good change right well I think my number one positive on this is

1418
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:38,360
that finally you know your facial hair has gotten a job that's fantastic you

1419
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:41,120
know because I think that's been overdue no I know all seriousness I think I think

1420
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:43,880
he sounds like a good candidate I think he could potentially be a performer

1421
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:47,000
that's why we're the show that has a beard knows how to use it that's right

1422
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:52,740
in a way I'm unhappy that someone even needed to fill in for the CEO Brendan

1423
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:57,200
Ike was fucking awesome he was a really great guy Chris Beard was the interim

1424
01:39:57,200 --> 01:40:02,680
CEO during this whole mix-up too so he he's kind of was already doing the job

1425
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:08,320
yeah as long as someone's took took the helm yeah take take the helm as it is

1426
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:13,760
that's it you know fresh blood yeah all right let's go see what our title is and

1427
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:22,160
then we'll get out of here well we'll get what's the guy's qualifications

1428
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:25,840
compared to Brendan like I mean obviously he didn't invent JavaScript but

1429
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:35,920
yeah I mean like server script and server I think about hex code in my head

1430
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:40,640
you know as in the binary and backtrack doing the bug the debugging that's what

1431
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:45,320
gave him the idea to make a tracing JIT compiler I am backtracking through hex

1432
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:50,120
I am or you know just look through on the cover his qualifications in today's

1433
01:40:50,120 --> 01:40:53,440
tech talk today he does have some good qualifications so that would be one to

1434
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:56,280
watch if you want to
