WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.880
I'm just saying we might have an opportunity here,

00:01.880 --> 00:04.000
because I guess the situation

00:04.000 --> 00:08.460
with the Raspberry Pi availability in stores is so bad

00:08.460 --> 00:13.100
that the Raspberry Pi Locator has been launched.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.160
It's rpilocator.com.

00:15.160 --> 00:16.080
Have you seen this, Wes?

00:16.080 --> 00:17.280
No, I have not.

00:17.280 --> 00:18.720
Yeah, so it's, I mean, it's as current

00:18.720 --> 00:20.360
as of like a few minutes ago.

00:20.360 --> 00:22.040
Oh yeah, last updated two minutes.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.360
What?

00:23.360 --> 00:24.880
Okay, Adafruit, that makes sense.

00:24.880 --> 00:26.520
Yeah, and I guess it's just been so tricky.

00:26.520 --> 00:27.660
It's getting a little bit better now,

00:27.660 --> 00:30.800
but really with the chip shortage and everything,

00:30.800 --> 00:32.580
people are having a hell of a time

00:32.580 --> 00:33.880
finding some of these Raspberry Pis.

00:33.880 --> 00:36.920
I mean, you can see like the Pi Zero sold out,

00:36.920 --> 00:40.360
Raspberry Pi 4 with eight gigs of RAM is totally sold out.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.120
Four gigs of RAM is totally sold out.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.880
Some of these prices are kind of all over the place too.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.760
You know, what's weird is the Raspberry Pi store

00:48.760 --> 00:51.240
like just hit three years old, like a week ago,

00:51.240 --> 00:53.600
and now they're launching three pop-up stores

00:53.600 --> 00:56.280
where they'll be selling the Raspberry Pi 4.

00:56.280 --> 00:57.840
But I'm looking at the inventory tracker here

00:57.840 --> 01:00.120
and it says none are available.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.640
So how did the store get the Raspberry Pis?

01:02.640 --> 01:04.100
Hmm.

01:04.100 --> 01:05.800
But you know what I'm thinking?

01:05.800 --> 01:07.000
It's a business opportunity here for us.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.560
I mean, you've got a few in your own back stock here.

01:09.560 --> 01:10.560
Right?

01:10.560 --> 01:15.160
We'll mark up the price, preload them with some desktop OS.

01:15.160 --> 01:17.000
We'll call it Jupiter OS.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.840
It'll make millions.

01:18.840 --> 01:30.960
Hello friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:30.960 --> 01:31.960
My name is Chris.

01:31.960 --> 01:32.960
My name is Wes.

01:32.960 --> 01:33.960
And my name is Brent.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.680
Hello, you two.

01:35.680 --> 01:36.940
Thanks for joining me today.

01:36.940 --> 01:40.200
We have something a lot of fun coming up, I guess.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.200
I don't know.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.640
I think so.

01:42.640 --> 01:46.560
Linux has really mastered the purpose-built computer.

01:46.560 --> 01:52.440
And this week, we're going to chat with the creator of the $15 Linux box.

01:52.440 --> 01:56.300
And really just kind of celebrate some of our favorite small little Linux computers.

01:56.300 --> 01:59.280
It's an area where Linux is the absolute powerhouse.

01:59.280 --> 02:04.060
And there is a new device in the works that looks so neat.

02:04.060 --> 02:08.640
And then we'll round up the show with some great emails, our picks, and more.

02:08.640 --> 02:11.360
So before we go any further, let's bring in our virtual lug.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.360
Hello, Mumble Room.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.360
Hello.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.360
Hello.

02:14.360 --> 02:15.360
Hello.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.360
Hello, everybody.

02:16.360 --> 02:22.280
You know, I got to say, 16 on Super Bowl Sunday is not bad.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.280
Good work, team.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.280
Am I allowed to say that?

02:24.280 --> 02:25.280
Well, you just did.

02:25.280 --> 02:26.280
So, yeah.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.120
I hope we don't get in trouble for that.

02:28.120 --> 02:29.960
But yeah, thank you guys for being here.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.140
You joined us on a Sunday when we're doing the show live.

02:32.140 --> 02:35.360
We start around noon Pacific.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.360
That's right.

02:36.360 --> 02:37.360
jblive.tv.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.360
I was just trying to think, like, should I do all the math?

02:38.360 --> 02:40.440
Should I try to go through the...

02:40.440 --> 02:44.520
You know, you thought about this in the past, and you actually set up a website that helps

02:44.520 --> 02:45.880
people figure that out for themselves.

02:45.880 --> 02:46.880
A website.

02:46.880 --> 02:47.880
Yeah.

02:47.880 --> 02:49.680
And it does the calculation...

02:49.680 --> 02:50.680
Robots or something.

02:50.680 --> 02:51.680
I don't know.

02:51.680 --> 02:52.680
I don't know how it works.

02:52.680 --> 02:53.680
Huh.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.600
We should set that up at like jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar or something like that.

02:56.600 --> 02:57.600
Yeah.

02:57.600 --> 02:58.600
We'll get Brent to do it after the show.

02:58.600 --> 03:04.200
I'm a little out of sorts because I did like a last minute slam and try on my Raspberry

03:04.200 --> 03:05.200
Pi 400.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.720
That's a technical term we use all the time at the show.

03:07.720 --> 03:15.560
I downloaded the just recently released, get ready for this, Ubuntu Unity Remix for the

03:15.560 --> 03:17.200
Raspberry Pi 4.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.200
Whoa.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.200
2204 edition.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.200
Okay.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.200
Yeah.

03:21.200 --> 03:26.960
So it's basically a beta of 2204, and it's been rebuilt to run on the Pi, and it's the

03:26.960 --> 03:28.700
Unity Remix.

03:28.700 --> 03:34.080
And you'll probably recall, Wes, that Unity actually started life as the Netbook edition.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.080
Ah, yes.

03:35.080 --> 03:39.000
I even tried that Netbook edition way back in the day.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Hell yeah.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah, it was great.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.960
It was just while on those tiny screens.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.400
It does make me curious, though.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.120
I mean, how did it perform?

03:46.120 --> 03:51.000
Well, I have to say, the potential is there, but I don't think it's fully 3D accelerated.

03:51.000 --> 03:58.440
I think it maybe is using some sort of LLVM pipe type acceleration, and that kind of kills

03:58.440 --> 03:59.440
Unity.

03:59.440 --> 04:03.600
So it's not super smooth, but it's as good as any other desktop for the most part that

04:03.600 --> 04:05.840
I have had on there.

04:05.840 --> 04:09.600
And there are aspects about Unity that hold up.

04:09.600 --> 04:14.240
I really like that when I hit the super key and the app launcher comes up, I really like

04:14.240 --> 04:15.600
that it doesn't take up the whole screen.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.600
Oh, yeah.

04:16.600 --> 04:17.600
I forgot about that.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.880
It's just a classy looking window that comes up, and it memorizes which ones you use the

04:20.880 --> 04:21.880
most often.

04:21.880 --> 04:22.880
Yeah.

04:22.880 --> 04:28.160
The other thing is they make it super easy to have the menu, like your file edit view

04:28.160 --> 04:33.960
menu, they make it super easy to either have that be global up in the top bar or to have

04:33.960 --> 04:38.540
it attached to each application if you want it displayed or not.

04:38.540 --> 04:43.720
And what ends up happening with this 2204 Remix is you get some of the latest GNOME

04:43.720 --> 04:49.680
apps from like the 42 release, but they have like menu bars and they just kind of operate

04:49.680 --> 04:54.240
like they did maybe a couple of releases years ago.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.240
That's a trip.

04:55.240 --> 04:59.680
It was a nice mix and I could see it really working well if it had a fully 3D accelerated

04:59.680 --> 05:04.680
experience like right now I hit the super key and the launcher is kind of a pop up.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.680
Yeah.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.680
Yeah.

05:06.680 --> 05:07.680
Isn't that great?

05:07.680 --> 05:14.160
And as you keep going, you've got a nice mix of a really nostalgic retro Linux workflow

05:14.160 --> 05:17.840
that actually like the dock, that Unity dock is great.

05:17.840 --> 05:18.840
I have to say.

05:18.840 --> 05:19.840
Yeah.

05:19.840 --> 05:20.840
I mean, they really got that right.

05:20.840 --> 05:21.840
They did.

05:21.840 --> 05:22.840
Just from the get go.

05:22.840 --> 05:25.640
And you get that kind of stuff, but you get all the latest GNOME apps.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.440
I mean, I kind of liked it.

05:27.440 --> 05:30.160
You're getting weird with things, but I like what's happening.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.560
You know, the other thing that kind of kills the Raspberry Pi is I'm using USB storage.

05:33.560 --> 05:34.560
Yeah, sure.

05:34.560 --> 05:39.600
You know, it's a little bit better on the compute module if you can use MMC.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.680
But the storage is still kind of a pain point for that stuff, too.

05:42.680 --> 05:43.680
But I liked it.

05:43.680 --> 05:44.680
I like it.

05:44.680 --> 05:47.000
I like it enough that I'm leaving it on there for now.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.820
And maybe I can experiment with the 3D acceleration.

05:50.820 --> 05:57.240
But there's a new way coming out for the Raspberry Pi still in beta to flash your storage.

05:57.240 --> 06:03.280
So like traditionally, I don't know how you do it, but traditionally I download an image

06:03.280 --> 06:05.720
and I will use either Etcher or DD.

06:05.720 --> 06:08.120
If even in the past, I would use DD Rescue.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.120
Sure.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.600
And I'll write that image to a USB drive.

06:11.600 --> 06:15.140
Not a SD card, but like a USB 3 SSD.

06:15.140 --> 06:16.740
And then I boot my Pi with that.

06:16.740 --> 06:19.040
But I think most people write it to an SD card or something like that.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.040
Yeah.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.300
Well, I mean, right, there was whole times where the USB boot didn't quite work without

06:22.300 --> 06:23.560
the shim anyway.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.560
Yeah.

06:24.560 --> 06:25.560
Yeah.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.360
Oh, it has gotten so much nicer.

06:27.360 --> 06:31.520
And now they have an official Raspberry Pi image flash.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.000
They've had it for a while.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.660
But they're taking things to the next level.

06:34.660 --> 06:38.440
And if you go get a new beta bootloader, which you have to flash the firmware on your Raspberry

06:38.440 --> 06:43.680
Pi, but you go get this and it's only, I think, for the 4 and 400.

06:43.680 --> 06:48.160
I've not tried this yet, but you get that new firmware installed on the Raspberry Pi

06:48.160 --> 06:51.280
and you connect it to Ethernet in a monitor and power.

06:51.280 --> 06:57.000
And if you press and hold down shift and then space bar at the prompt, that Raspberry Pi

06:57.000 --> 06:59.560
will now do a network boot.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.560
Oh, wow.

07:01.560 --> 07:02.560
Huge dude.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.560
Yeah.

07:03.560 --> 07:04.560
That is a big change.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.520
And I think something a lot of folks who deployed, you know, like yourself, who are deploying

07:07.520 --> 07:10.320
many pies, that's killer.

07:10.320 --> 07:11.320
Huge.

07:11.320 --> 07:16.040
And you can then boot up to a network version of the Pi Imager app.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.040
It'll host that.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.040
Oh.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.760
And then sitting physically at the Raspberry Pi, you can choose the OS you want it to flash

07:21.760 --> 07:25.080
to the storage and you choose the storage medium.

07:25.080 --> 07:28.240
And then it sits there and flashes it and then reboots and you're in the OS.

07:28.240 --> 07:32.240
And depending on the OS you choose, like if you choose their OS, you can set things like

07:32.240 --> 07:34.560
the Wi-Fi network to join to at reboot.

07:34.560 --> 07:38.260
You can set SSH, change the root password before it ever boots up.

07:38.260 --> 07:39.260
That's really nice.

07:39.260 --> 07:43.080
I like too that maybe for like someone, assuming this gets out of beta, that was a little easier

07:43.080 --> 07:44.080
to access.

07:44.080 --> 07:47.640
I like the idea that someone who hasn't purchased a pre-installed setup, you know, just like

07:47.640 --> 07:51.360
plugs in their storage medium, plugs in a, you know, there it gets their network going

07:51.360 --> 07:56.080
and then they get this kind of nice setup to pick an OS and move forward.

07:56.080 --> 07:57.640
I know.

07:57.640 --> 08:02.480
And what I always like to do with these Raspberry Pi stories is do like a little thought experiment

08:02.480 --> 08:08.560
and say, okay, so that's interesting, but what does this mean five years down the road

08:08.560 --> 08:13.200
when the Raspberry Pi is even more powerful and it has even better storage and it's still

08:13.200 --> 08:17.520
around this price point, you know, let's say it's around $60 on average.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.180
What does that mean for a school?

08:19.180 --> 08:26.000
You could have a lab full of these $60 computers and now you could have a TA go around and

08:26.000 --> 08:29.560
reload the OSs or you could probably even automate it.

08:29.560 --> 08:34.760
And so it's not just for guys like me who are doing home server stuff with our Raspberry

08:34.760 --> 08:40.280
Pies, but I will think about like wide scale, like library deployments.

08:40.280 --> 08:43.840
Imagine a computer lab at a library with $60 computers.

08:43.840 --> 08:47.800
Like that doesn't take millions of dollars of funding to accomplish.

08:47.800 --> 08:53.800
And when you make it as easy as, you know, hold down shift and then press the space bar,

08:53.800 --> 08:55.320
like that's pretty amazing.

08:55.320 --> 08:59.160
Like that makes it accessible to even just the library staff if they just had a checklist

08:59.160 --> 09:02.520
of steps to follow and they could reload the machines.

09:02.520 --> 09:03.520
Super exciting.

09:03.520 --> 09:04.520
Yeah.

09:04.520 --> 09:05.520
It does seem like a nice, nice amount of polish.

09:05.520 --> 09:08.040
Do we know if you can customize the Netboot stuff yet?

09:08.040 --> 09:09.040
I don't know the details.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.040
I should try it.

09:10.040 --> 09:15.120
So I think it's doing Netboot, but I don't know if it's just like straight up TFTP and

09:15.120 --> 09:19.360
taking DHCP or if it's only talking to the Raspberry Pi Imager app.

09:19.360 --> 09:20.960
So that would be something I would have to try.

09:20.960 --> 09:21.960
Yeah.

09:21.960 --> 09:22.960
This should be fun to play with.

09:22.960 --> 09:23.960
Yeah.

09:23.960 --> 09:24.960
It could be really great.

09:24.960 --> 09:25.960
Yeah.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.160
And there's a lot of things going forward.

09:27.160 --> 09:32.120
So people out there have tried it, let us know at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

09:32.120 --> 09:37.880
And then last week we saw the Raspberry Pi folks release the 64 bit version of Raspberry

09:37.880 --> 09:38.880
Pi OS.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.200
We talked about a little bit in Linux action news.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.000
I can't effing believe it took this long.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.280
So long, but you know, it happened.

09:47.280 --> 09:51.560
I guess what they had some reasons around, we don't want to confuse the customers, but

09:51.560 --> 09:55.440
also just compatibility, I guess, you know, because some of the older boards didn't, aren't

09:55.440 --> 09:59.680
a 64 bit architecture and such, but all the new stuff, all the pies people are excited

09:59.680 --> 10:00.680
about and talking about.

10:00.680 --> 10:01.680
Yeah.

10:01.680 --> 10:05.480
You remember how like just a little while ago they released a new version of their desktop

10:05.480 --> 10:09.640
where they completely ported it to like a new version of GTK and didn't say anything

10:09.640 --> 10:10.640
to anybody really.

10:10.640 --> 10:11.640
And there's just like surprise.

10:11.640 --> 10:12.640
I do remember that.

10:12.640 --> 10:16.640
They don't operate the way most people playing in the Linux ecosystem operate.

10:16.640 --> 10:17.640
No.

10:17.640 --> 10:18.640
That's a good point.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.600
And they don't move at the speed of open source.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.560
They move at the speed of the Raspberry Pi.

10:22.560 --> 10:23.560
Yeah.

10:23.560 --> 10:24.560
It's a different type of organization.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.040
They have a slightly different type of agenda.

10:26.040 --> 10:31.840
I mean, I'm seriously like two years maybe into running Ubuntu 64 bit.

10:31.840 --> 10:32.840
Yeah.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.080
And they're just now getting their OS out.

10:36.080 --> 10:40.200
It's strange too, because like if you dig around in there now, it no longer shows up

10:40.200 --> 10:43.340
as a Raspberry Pi OS, but it shows up as Debian 11.

10:43.340 --> 10:44.340
It's got Linux 510.

10:44.340 --> 10:45.660
Oh, interesting.

10:45.660 --> 10:52.400
So question, do you suspect that by switching Raspberry Pi OS to 64 bit, the performance

10:52.400 --> 10:55.600
improved on the Raspberry Pi or was degraded?

10:55.600 --> 10:58.800
Because you got to remember only a few even have four gigs of RAM or greater.

10:58.800 --> 10:59.800
Yeah.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.400
It's not like it's the most robust system ever.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.400
Brent, do you have a guess?

11:03.400 --> 11:07.760
Did the Raspberry Pi get faster or slower when they switched the OS to 64 bit?

11:07.760 --> 11:13.680
Well my initial reaction is to say that surely they've run this 32 bit version forever and

11:13.680 --> 11:15.640
optimized it for years.

11:15.640 --> 11:21.480
So I would expect the code for the 64 bit stuff to be a little newer, maybe not optimized

11:21.480 --> 11:22.480
as much.

11:22.480 --> 11:26.440
So I would want to say the 32 bit one for now is a little bit faster.

11:26.440 --> 11:31.320
But I don't know, I hesitate with that because obviously 64 bit is probably going to be way

11:31.320 --> 11:32.760
better and there's a reason they're doing it.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.760
So mixed.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.480
I mean, it's just more numbers.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.000
Doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be faster.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
What do you think Wes?

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
It's just more numbers.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Yeah.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.440
There could be probably some cases where maybe the 32 bit version has an edge.

11:44.440 --> 11:48.680
But I would bet just with the way things have gone in the underlying kernel, you know, for

11:48.680 --> 11:52.720
the past few years that the 64 bit ends up being the winner.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.120
Well you guys are too clever.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.600
So Michael Arbel did the benchmarks.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.560
Ah, very nice.

11:58.560 --> 12:04.680
And you're right Wes, in some small instances the 32 bit version was faster at a few things

12:04.680 --> 12:05.680
like Brent implied.

12:05.680 --> 12:09.200
It's probably because that's where it's been heavily optimized.

12:09.200 --> 12:13.960
But on average, Larbel said 48 percent faster on the 64 bit version.

12:13.960 --> 12:14.960
Wow.

12:14.960 --> 12:15.960
That's huge.

12:15.960 --> 12:16.960
Oh man.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.440
Sort of makes it worse that they've waited so long.

12:18.440 --> 12:19.440
I know.

12:19.440 --> 12:23.720
And it's because, you know, the 64 bit code I think is in better shape.

12:23.720 --> 12:26.840
I think there's some efficiencies that were gained.

12:26.840 --> 12:30.440
I don't know ARM very well but I think there's like a difference and I'm sure somebody's

12:30.440 --> 12:31.480
going to now give us a book.

12:31.480 --> 12:35.680
But I think there's a difference between like they went from ARM 7 to ARM 9 which brings

12:35.680 --> 12:39.880
in like a whole raft of efficiencies but I have no damn idea what I'm talking about.

12:39.880 --> 12:43.120
But I can imagine that plays a little bit in there.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.280
So okay, cards on the table now Brent.

12:45.280 --> 12:49.680
You told us before the show that you had a bit of a Raspberry Pi confession that you wanted

12:49.680 --> 12:51.560
to tell us and we don't know what it is.

12:51.560 --> 12:52.560
No idea.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.560
We've been waiting to find out.

12:53.560 --> 12:56.640
Yeah I specifically didn't tell you because I don't think you're going to believe me.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.720
But here's my confession.

12:58.720 --> 13:05.920
I have never run or booted or played with a Raspberry Pi.

13:05.920 --> 13:06.920
Period.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.920
What?

13:07.920 --> 13:08.920
Like at all?

13:08.920 --> 13:09.920
Not even played with one?

13:09.920 --> 13:10.920
No.

13:10.920 --> 13:11.920
Not at all.

13:11.920 --> 13:12.920
Wow.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.640
I've certainly held a lot and seen you guys playing with them all the time.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.480
You like lived in the RV.

13:16.480 --> 13:17.480
It ran the RV.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.240
Oh I know what they're capable of.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.000
I certainly know what they're capable of.

13:21.000 --> 13:26.080
But in terms of like in my own little home lab, you know, and diving in and seeing what

13:26.080 --> 13:27.080
I can get out of it.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.080
No.

13:28.080 --> 13:31.200
I don't even have one in my place, which seems like I shouldn't even.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.280
Why am I even in this room with you guys talking about this?

13:33.280 --> 13:34.280
It doesn't make any sense.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.280
Right?

13:35.280 --> 13:37.720
Well, I feel like this is just a tremendous opportunity for the show.

13:37.720 --> 13:40.200
We're going to have to capture Brent's first Raspberry Pi experience.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.200
I'm going to think about this.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.080
Can we start them on the one just so we can.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.400
Oh my gosh.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.680
I have one sitting in my home.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.760
Is there still software for the one?

13:47.760 --> 13:49.880
You could probably get at least something running on there.

13:49.880 --> 13:53.960
I do feel like that'd be such a great way to appreciate the growth that this tiny little

13:53.960 --> 13:55.360
$35 computers had.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.520
And Grant, we're about to talk about a $15 computer in a moment.

13:58.520 --> 14:02.240
Do you have any confessions, Wes, that you want to get about Raspberry Pi?

14:02.240 --> 14:03.640
I'm not running one now.

14:03.640 --> 14:04.640
I do.

14:04.640 --> 14:05.640
I have plenty with them.

14:05.640 --> 14:11.000
I have probably three or four sitting around my home in boxes that have been deployed before.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.800
But it's probably been, I don't know, two years since I like really had one that was

14:14.800 --> 14:16.540
actually running anything significant.

14:16.540 --> 14:20.800
I noticed, Wes, you have one sitting in your entrance at your place, just kind of on the

14:20.800 --> 14:21.800
shelf there.

14:21.800 --> 14:22.800
Yeah, that's the one.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.720
At some point I was trying to buy something and I obviously bought this at like two in

14:25.720 --> 14:29.140
the morning or something and bought the one and forgot to return it.

14:29.140 --> 14:31.800
So now it's just, yeah, now it's a display piece and now it has a point.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.280
It turns out it was an investment.

14:33.280 --> 14:36.720
You could sell it for a premium, you just didn't know.

14:36.720 --> 14:37.720
All right.

14:37.720 --> 14:45.240
So that's actually pretty understandable because really it took until the Pi 4 before I changed

14:45.240 --> 14:47.460
the way I view the Raspberry Pi.

14:47.460 --> 14:49.600
Everything until the 4 I just played with.

14:49.600 --> 14:53.160
It was a toy just to see what can you do with something this cheap and this small.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.160
Yeah.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.200
Hey, look, that's the same Linux running over there.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.200
Cool.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.200
Why would I use this?

14:58.200 --> 15:04.500
But as time has gone on and the Pi has gotten better and better, but also at the same time

15:04.500 --> 15:06.460
the network effect has grown.

15:06.460 --> 15:08.240
That's a huge factor for the Pi.

15:08.240 --> 15:13.920
There's so many great small board computers for Linux, but nothing has a network effect

15:13.920 --> 15:15.280
like the Pi.

15:15.280 --> 15:23.520
It almost creates a Macintosh effect for Linux because everybody is targeting a common piece

15:23.520 --> 15:24.520
of hardware.

15:24.520 --> 15:27.600
If I tell you I have a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 gigs of RAM.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.960
You know exactly what that is.

15:28.960 --> 15:32.080
You know what video card it has, you know what network chip it has, you know what GPU

15:32.080 --> 15:33.080
it has.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.240
It's as close as we get.

15:34.240 --> 15:38.080
It's like a defragment to the Linux, micro Linux ecosystem.

15:38.080 --> 15:42.200
And you could see the advantage of that as they get better and better.

15:42.200 --> 15:46.040
What they've done now with the compute module, oh, I meant to bring it into the studio just

15:46.040 --> 15:49.600
so we could look at it while we're talking about it, is so awesome.

15:49.600 --> 15:54.560
It's such an impressive amount of compute on something that's so small.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.600
It's smaller than a credit card.

15:55.600 --> 15:59.000
It's smaller than the Raspberry Pi computer is normally.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.080
And then I can put it on these boards that have all of this IO, including PCI cards and

16:04.080 --> 16:05.880
all kinds of stuff.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.000
I'm testing one right now.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.140
It's dual gigabit NICs on a Pi compute module and it's on the PCI bus.

16:12.140 --> 16:13.920
It's really awesome.

16:13.920 --> 16:22.040
And so what I realized is, number one, most people that are going to use a Raspberry Pi

16:22.040 --> 16:27.040
are going to use it for something practical, a job, a project.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.840
Not many people are going to use it as a desktop, right?

16:28.840 --> 16:29.840
Not yet.

16:29.840 --> 16:30.840
Right.

16:30.840 --> 16:31.840
Because, as you mentioned, the network effect, right?

16:31.840 --> 16:33.720
There's a lot of these pre-built images of stuff.

16:33.720 --> 16:34.720
You want to try some hardware.

16:34.720 --> 16:35.720
They're like, I'll just flash this thing.

16:35.720 --> 16:39.200
Now you've got a purpose-built Pi that's just running whatever you're trying to play with.

16:39.200 --> 16:43.080
And there's so many projects out there that are building self-hosted stuff that just has

16:43.080 --> 16:44.720
a Pi image ready to go.

16:44.720 --> 16:52.120
And that's, it's maybe one of the most important things that happened in Linux ever because

16:52.120 --> 16:53.960
it's so accessible.

16:53.960 --> 16:58.160
The price point is so accessible and it works so well with Linux, both because Linux is

16:58.160 --> 17:03.880
free, but also because of its capabilities, its scalability, its unique design.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.400
It's such a perfect marriage.

17:06.400 --> 17:12.280
It both showcases and makes it a great place for Linux to run, but it also kind of nicely

17:12.280 --> 17:16.560
hides the Linux bits, you know, because some of those other boards, they've gotten better,

17:16.560 --> 17:19.600
but a lot of those are like, okay, we'll go figure out how do you get the software?

17:19.600 --> 17:20.600
Do you have to build something?

17:20.600 --> 17:22.320
Do you have to have the right kernel that works with this?

17:22.320 --> 17:25.880
Or make sure you do this in grub so that it initializes this device correctly and it's

17:25.880 --> 17:26.880
like, what?

17:26.880 --> 17:27.880
I'm doing what?

17:27.880 --> 17:28.880
Okay.

17:28.880 --> 17:29.880
Which is interesting to me.

17:29.880 --> 17:30.880
Yeah.

17:30.880 --> 17:31.880
It's hard to learn on.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.280
And these days it's getting to the point now where a lot of distributions are just releasing

17:34.280 --> 17:39.800
an arm ISO, not an image, not a pre-built image, but an ISO that you just go grab and

17:39.800 --> 17:42.360
do the regular install and it just works on the Raspberry Pi.

17:42.360 --> 17:47.160
Between that, you know, USB boot support, network booting, like these are becoming way

17:47.160 --> 17:50.560
closer to what we're used to thinking of as like an x86 PC.

17:50.560 --> 17:51.560
Exactly.

17:51.560 --> 17:59.040
And I think it makes, at least for most people, just such a perfect home server.

17:59.040 --> 18:04.000
And there's things out there like Home Assistant that will turn it into an application

18:04.000 --> 18:09.560
platform where you have a marketplace of apps, they call it a marketplace, they're all free.

18:09.560 --> 18:15.760
Or projects like Umbral, which turn a Raspberry Pi into a Bitcoin node and has a bunch of

18:15.760 --> 18:18.080
really high quality apps.

18:18.080 --> 18:23.480
And these projects, they're like sound, they're Linux based, they're using containers in a

18:23.480 --> 18:27.800
clever way to manage and update and secure and separate the applications.

18:27.800 --> 18:32.080
The user experience is getting unbelievably good UI wise.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.640
And it's amazing what this little Pi can do.

18:34.640 --> 18:38.620
My Raspberry Pi at home, and I'll link to a couple episodes in Self Hosted where I go

18:38.620 --> 18:43.200
into more detail, specifically Home Network under $200.

18:43.200 --> 18:46.680
And also I would check out Crouching Pi Hidden Server.

18:46.680 --> 18:47.680
Great titles.

18:47.680 --> 18:53.000
Where what I do is, currently I've had more, but currently I have two Raspberry Pi 4s running

18:53.000 --> 18:57.760
in my RV with some USB storage that's all butter FS.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.840
And Home Assistant is probably the number one application.

19:00.840 --> 19:06.520
And there's probably 300 different devices feeding into Home Assistant in this RV.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.000
I mean, we're talking, it's a lot.

19:09.000 --> 19:15.080
And then there's a series of automations that control lighting, heating, propane, things

19:15.080 --> 19:17.760
that are just sort of like outside.

19:17.760 --> 19:23.800
So like lights, noisemakers, these kinds of things, cameras, that kind of motion sensors,

19:23.800 --> 19:28.560
temperature sensors, humidity sensors, vibration sensors, all kinds of stuff, right?

19:28.560 --> 19:31.280
Then the damn thing also runs Plex.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.840
So while it's doing, while it's managing and automating all of that stuff.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.920
While it's running your life, it also.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.940
It streams our Plex videos for us.

19:38.940 --> 19:45.260
The other one, the other Pi is managing cameras and also runs a Pi hole in a container and

19:45.260 --> 19:49.220
does DNS, DHCP, ad blocking for the network.

19:49.220 --> 19:51.000
And I run those on two Pis.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.160
I can run that whole rig off of solar because they just sip the power doing all of that

19:55.160 --> 19:56.160
for me.

19:56.160 --> 20:00.580
And honestly, it would be a little faster, Home Assistant, when I run it on faster hardware,

20:00.580 --> 20:01.580
I notice a difference.

20:01.580 --> 20:02.680
Yeah, sure.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.640
Sometimes I compromise a little bit.

20:04.640 --> 20:09.640
But for me, the appliance nature of it, the low power use of it, and now the horsepower

20:09.640 --> 20:12.600
at the Pi 4, it's a pretty good compromise for me.

20:12.600 --> 20:13.600
It really hits a sweet spot.

20:13.600 --> 20:17.600
And I think most people would be surprised they don't need a huge x86 box in their house.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.520
Yeah, you can get away with a lot on those things.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.640
And that's where I think maybe it would be interesting to see what Brent does because

20:21.640 --> 20:26.960
I mean, you're mobile, you don't always have full access to infrastructure, that's where

20:26.960 --> 20:27.960
these things can shine.

20:27.960 --> 20:32.760
Yeah, I've certainly been using laptops that I've found in the landfill to do very similar

20:32.760 --> 20:33.760
things.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.200
It's surprising what people throw out.

20:35.200 --> 20:40.480
I've always kind of been like, oh, a Pi would be a perfect thing if only I had one, et cetera,

20:40.480 --> 20:41.480
et cetera.

20:41.480 --> 20:45.920
Chris, one thing I'm curious about is what do you hope the Pi 5 has that the 4 doesn't

20:45.920 --> 20:46.920
have currently?

20:46.920 --> 20:52.000
I always would like more CPU power, more GPU power and more RAM always, obviously.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.040
But for me, it's 32 gig by Oh, God, I'd use it.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.040
I would.

20:56.040 --> 20:57.040
Yeah.

20:57.040 --> 20:59.440
But for me, it's definitely at this point, disk IO.

20:59.440 --> 21:00.440
That'd be the killer.

21:00.440 --> 21:04.280
I'd love to not have my entire setup running on USB storage.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.820
It's better with the compute module now.

21:06.820 --> 21:11.620
And with the compute module, you can use built in eMMC storage.

21:11.620 --> 21:14.200
It's only about 112 megabytes a second.

21:14.200 --> 21:18.800
So it's not the fastest storage, but that's pretty usable for your OS disk.

21:18.800 --> 21:23.720
And then I use the USB storage for like home or media content, but I'd love to see some

21:23.720 --> 21:25.640
more options around that.

21:25.640 --> 21:26.640
SATA would be incredible.

21:26.640 --> 21:29.240
Oh, I'd love to know what people have done to address that.

21:29.240 --> 21:36.560
I could see the compute module in a carrier board that has a PCI slot that I then put

21:36.560 --> 21:41.640
a SATA controller into because the beautiful thing is, is once you get that compute module

21:41.640 --> 21:46.480
into one of these carrier boards, and there's several out there, it's not what's compatible

21:46.480 --> 21:48.080
with the Raspberry Pi, really.

21:48.080 --> 21:51.720
It's more of, well, what works with Linux because it's just a Linux box.

21:51.720 --> 21:55.980
And so if there's a kernel driver for it, I can go get a SATA controller now, plug that

21:55.980 --> 21:59.000
in and use it with a Raspberry Pi.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
It's so cool.

22:00.000 --> 22:06.600
I say it's kind of like the Macintosh of Linux boxes, except for you also have all the upsides

22:06.600 --> 22:07.600
that it's Linux.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.080
You can put any distro you want on there.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.400
You're not restricted to one OS.

22:11.400 --> 22:13.720
They don't lock it down to just Raspberry Pi OS.

22:13.720 --> 22:18.220
And you get the power of the Linux kernel, which is tremendously more powerful than MacOS.

22:18.220 --> 22:20.880
It's just such a great solution for our community.

22:20.880 --> 22:25.360
And as it gets more powerful, I could really see people building laptops around these compute

22:25.360 --> 22:29.880
modules and you get something like a framework laptop housing, and then you put your own

22:29.880 --> 22:31.640
compute module into it.

22:31.640 --> 22:32.640
I'd love something like that.

22:32.640 --> 22:33.640
Right.

22:33.640 --> 22:34.640
It makes it super simple to get started.

22:34.640 --> 22:35.640
You just swap it up.

22:35.640 --> 22:36.640
Yeah.

22:36.640 --> 22:41.600
You just import in a laptop with a replaceable compute module, so every couple of years,

22:41.600 --> 22:44.600
even if you can only do it for a little while, but yeah, you pop out the compute module,

22:44.600 --> 22:45.680
you pop in a new one.

22:45.680 --> 22:46.680
That's an attractive idea.

22:46.680 --> 22:48.520
I don't know how practical it is, but boy, that would be cool.

22:48.520 --> 22:52.320
Oh, I totally love it.

22:52.320 --> 22:55.080
linode.com slash unplugged.

22:55.080 --> 22:56.080
Is it unplugged?

22:56.080 --> 22:57.080
Is that right?

22:57.080 --> 22:58.080
Is that right?

22:58.080 --> 22:59.080
Could you check it for me real quick, Wes?

22:59.080 --> 23:00.080
Will you go there?

23:00.080 --> 23:01.080
It's linode.com slash unplugged.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.720
We got to make sure it's working.

23:02.720 --> 23:03.960
Maybe everybody should check it real quick.

23:03.960 --> 23:04.960
You probably should check.

23:04.960 --> 23:05.960
Yeah.

23:05.960 --> 23:06.960
Okay.

23:06.960 --> 23:07.960
Welcome Linux Unplugged listeners.

23:07.960 --> 23:08.960
Hey, that's me.

23:08.960 --> 23:09.960
So that's all you had to do to support the show?

23:09.960 --> 23:10.960
That's it.

23:10.960 --> 23:11.960
Oh.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.600
Well, you know, while you're there, you might want to sign up because you get $100 in 60-day

23:14.600 --> 23:18.440
credit on a new account, and then you can really kick the tires with that.

23:18.440 --> 23:22.520
That's some horsepower, Wes, to really try it for a while and form a genuine opinion

23:22.520 --> 23:23.520
on it.

23:23.520 --> 23:27.720
And you know, they got 11 data centers around the world, so when you become a traveling

23:27.720 --> 23:31.960
man again, you could pick a data center that's going to be near you regardless, really.

23:31.960 --> 23:36.360
Yeah, spin up a little personal VPN setup, get some local infrastructure to back up your

23:36.360 --> 23:37.920
photos while you're traveling.

23:37.920 --> 23:43.480
You know, they take extra care to make sure that they remain VPN-friendly, and that is

23:43.480 --> 23:47.700
such a great use case for Nebula, too, to connect you between your machines or something

23:47.700 --> 23:48.960
like TailScale in there.

23:48.960 --> 23:49.960
Yeah.

23:49.960 --> 23:50.960
Oh, man, it's so nice.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.360
And you know, Linode systems are crazy fast.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.040
Years ago, they became their own ISP.

23:55.040 --> 23:56.040
How do you even do that?

23:56.040 --> 24:00.960
I mean, I know it's a thing companies do, but it's not something like Jupiter Broadcasting

24:00.960 --> 24:01.960
is doing anytime.

24:01.960 --> 24:02.960
No, right?

24:02.960 --> 24:05.920
I mean, that means you have to really know your stuff and have a competent staff who

24:05.920 --> 24:08.040
can manage all that infrastructure.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.040
Yeah.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.880
Early on, we were using Linode pretty typically.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.480
We were spinning up systems.

24:12.480 --> 24:17.240
We were really just doing traditional storage, and that worked really well.

24:17.240 --> 24:18.240
And the pricing's great.

24:18.240 --> 24:19.720
The performance is great.

24:19.720 --> 24:23.080
But then as time went on, we kind of started doing like, okay, well, this is going to be

24:23.080 --> 24:27.200
a compute system, and the backend storage is actually going to be S3 object storage

24:27.200 --> 24:31.720
because they've got S3 compatible object storage, and we started taking advantage of their different

24:31.720 --> 24:36.000
setups, just experimented over time because it's really simple to experiment.

24:36.000 --> 24:41.320
And we really kind of feel like we're Linode pros now, you know, and we just go right to

24:41.320 --> 24:42.320
it.

24:42.320 --> 24:43.320
Everybody knows how to use it.

24:43.320 --> 24:46.720
I mean, part of that is we just like to go root around on the dashboard and see what's

24:46.720 --> 24:48.960
new, see all the stuff that they can do for us, you know.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.320
I mean, there's always something interesting to play with.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.320
Yeah.

24:52.320 --> 24:55.320
I was talking to our friends at Linode just recently, and they're working on a new service

24:55.320 --> 24:57.360
that I will be able to tell you about soon.

24:57.360 --> 24:58.360
Ah, not yet.

24:58.360 --> 25:01.000
But there's just so much good stuff they're working on all the time.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
So what was it again?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
It was linode.com slash unplugged?

25:04.000 --> 25:05.000
Slash unplugged.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
And you just did that real quick?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
Oh, in any browser, actually.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Huh.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Well, how about that?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Even if you're not on Linux.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
We should all do that.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Maybe get $100, too.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
Sign up and go try them out.

25:13.000 --> 25:14.520
And thanks to Linode for sponsoring the program.

25:14.520 --> 25:16.920
It's linode.com slash unplugged.

25:16.920 --> 25:23.520
All right, well, we were just waxing poetic about our love for the Raspberry Pi.

25:23.520 --> 25:27.520
But really, I mean, between the modern Pis, between some of the stuff that's come out

25:27.520 --> 25:33.680
from the Pine folks, there's a huge amount of really neat, powerful, cheap hardware out

25:33.680 --> 25:34.680
there.

25:34.680 --> 25:37.720
I mean, at least as long as you're not trying to buy a GPU or anything.

25:37.720 --> 25:40.680
But this week, something new caught our attention.

25:40.680 --> 25:43.640
The portable, minimum viable computer.

25:43.640 --> 25:47.280
It's a Linux box for $15.

25:47.280 --> 25:51.520
And Chris had a chance to sit down with the creator to find out how it works.

25:51.520 --> 25:56.280
Well, Brian, thank you for coming on, because, you know, when I saw minimum viable computer

25:56.280 --> 25:57.620
that piqued my interest.

25:57.620 --> 26:03.080
But then, like, like some kind of headline title ninja, you managed to throw in there

26:03.080 --> 26:05.680
or a Linux box for $15.

26:05.680 --> 26:08.240
And my mind was just completely scrambled.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.120
I had to stop and read this.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.120
Headlines are an art.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.120
They are, man.

26:12.120 --> 26:13.120
You nailed it.

26:13.120 --> 26:18.480
The New York Post is absolutely awful, but the headlines, right.

26:18.480 --> 26:22.060
So it was a calculated move, but I think you must have gotten a lot of interest because

26:22.060 --> 26:25.440
this showed up in so many different like feeds that I have and whatnot.

26:25.440 --> 26:30.080
I think the idea resonates with people, a $15 usable Linux box.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.900
I mean, yeah, it's not going to be amazing.

26:32.900 --> 26:34.640
Tell me a little bit about your idea here.

26:34.640 --> 26:37.280
As far as the why I can't answer that.

26:37.280 --> 26:40.040
But what is the cheapest thing?

26:40.040 --> 26:42.800
The minimal viable computer.

26:42.800 --> 26:48.000
So I wrote for Hackaday, I know everybody that's doing electronic projects.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.360
What is the minimal computer?

26:49.360 --> 26:50.520
You can run Doom.

26:50.520 --> 26:54.120
You can theoretically run Doom on a bunch of lights.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.120
A smart bulb.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.120
Yeah.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.120
You want memory?

26:57.120 --> 26:58.960
Well, you can make that out of a 555.

26:58.960 --> 27:02.440
Those are really computers like, like, yeah, they compute.

27:02.440 --> 27:06.680
But I mean, nobody's actually doing work on an Apple II now.

27:06.680 --> 27:15.140
So for the entire super set of modern things that we do with computers, what is it?

27:15.140 --> 27:16.140
That's the question.

27:16.140 --> 27:20.000
I came down with the idea, okay, it runs Linux, just command line.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.000
You don't need it.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
You don't need a graphical interface.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000
Right.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000
It's minimum viable.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Yeah.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.320
You can do all the computing that you usually do except for graphics and audio and whatever

27:28.320 --> 27:31.520
in gaming with just command line.

27:31.520 --> 27:32.520
Okay.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.080
We need a keyboard too.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.080
Okay.

27:36.080 --> 27:40.920
And let's see, you need a small screen.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.520
It doesn't need to be high resolution.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.800
There's plenty of screens there.

27:44.800 --> 27:48.280
You can just plug that into a spy port and it's fine.

27:48.280 --> 27:49.280
Okay.

27:49.280 --> 27:50.280
A battery.

27:50.280 --> 27:51.280
That's it.

27:51.280 --> 27:54.920
You know, put a USB port in there so you can plug in a wireless thing.

27:54.920 --> 27:55.920
And you've got Wi-Fi.

27:55.920 --> 27:57.640
You've got ethernet.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.880
You've got a real keyboard.

27:59.880 --> 28:00.880
That's it.

28:00.880 --> 28:01.880
That's all you need.

28:01.880 --> 28:02.880
So that's the question.

28:02.880 --> 28:03.880
How do you design this?

28:03.880 --> 28:08.880
Well, you need a Linux SOC.

28:08.880 --> 28:09.880
Yeah.

28:09.880 --> 28:10.880
All winners got one.

28:10.880 --> 28:11.880
It's like 70 cents.

28:11.880 --> 28:12.880
Yep.

28:12.880 --> 28:13.880
Okay.

28:13.880 --> 28:21.480
So Linux and then keyboard, which is the tripping point in any small computer thing.

28:21.480 --> 28:28.600
Well, I did something with like silicone membrane keyboards, like in a remote control.

28:28.600 --> 28:33.440
As an aside, how they make those, they take the silicone sheet, they CNC, basically a

28:33.440 --> 28:34.880
waffle iron.

28:34.880 --> 28:40.120
They run this silicone sheet through this waffle iron, close it and it vulcanizes or

28:40.120 --> 28:41.120
something.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.720
And you get buttons like a remote control.

28:43.720 --> 28:49.960
So I actually built one of those for an earlier project and it's like, this is actually a

28:49.960 --> 28:56.120
workable keyboard for a handheld thing and you don't need hundreds of tiny little parts

28:56.120 --> 28:58.080
like you would in a BlackBerry keyboard.

28:58.080 --> 29:04.440
It's like, okay, well, you can run that off like some GPIOs off the all-winner chip.

29:04.440 --> 29:10.920
It's got USB already and you just get a spy display and that's it.

29:10.920 --> 29:11.920
That's the hardware.

29:11.920 --> 29:17.040
I mean, yeah, you're talking a 320 by 240 resolution on the display.

29:17.040 --> 29:20.420
You're talking, you know, 533 megahertz CPU.

29:20.420 --> 29:25.000
But again, if you're just doing the command line and using this to connect to devices

29:25.000 --> 29:27.760
or something like that, send out some pings.

29:27.760 --> 29:28.760
Yeah.

29:28.760 --> 29:29.760
You know what?

29:29.760 --> 29:33.080
You've got several versions of Linux to choose from too.

29:33.080 --> 29:39.440
It may even be possible to run like, not mainline, but you know, five point whatever that we're

29:39.440 --> 29:40.440
up to now.

29:40.440 --> 29:41.440
Yeah.

29:41.440 --> 29:45.280
How much pings do you think, you know, you look at the material, 15 bucks, but then there's

29:45.280 --> 29:47.040
also time to put it together.

29:47.040 --> 29:50.320
So maybe it's, how much really do you think it would cost to actually build this?

29:50.320 --> 29:53.680
Break down the bomb would be 15 bucks.

29:53.680 --> 29:55.600
That includes the battery.

29:55.600 --> 29:58.240
That includes basically all the parts.

29:58.240 --> 30:05.120
I don't know if we're doing nickel metal hydride or lithium yet, because if you do the math

30:05.120 --> 30:08.320
on that, it kind of balances out.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.580
In terms of price or capacity?

30:10.580 --> 30:17.040
In terms of price with lithium, you get way better capacity and you're basically trading

30:17.040 --> 30:21.880
ease of shipping for vastly increased battery life.

30:21.880 --> 30:22.880
I see.

30:22.880 --> 30:23.880
Okay.

30:23.880 --> 30:25.040
So that's, that's the entire bomb.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.360
Plus time to assemble.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.360
Well, I would not assemble a thousand of these.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.160
So you're thinking a kit maybe?

30:31.160 --> 30:32.360
Not a kit.

30:32.360 --> 30:33.560
I would have it assembled.

30:33.560 --> 30:39.800
I know a few people, few board houses that would put this together and then after the

30:39.800 --> 30:44.440
board is done, it's just popping two batteries and plugging in the screen and showing it

30:44.440 --> 30:45.680
a case.

30:45.680 --> 30:53.480
So that might be five to $7 to assemble everything.

30:53.480 --> 30:59.120
All the parts, all the boards, you throw those through a machine and that adds like five

30:59.120 --> 31:00.120
to $7.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.120
So, okay.

31:01.120 --> 31:08.060
Now we're up to 20 and you know, you got the margin on that plus shipping.

31:08.060 --> 31:13.800
If you do it in quantity, it could be like 35, 45.

31:13.800 --> 31:19.360
That's that's low, but it is a realistic number for what that could be.

31:19.360 --> 31:23.000
I mean, it sounds like you've gotten a lot of people interested.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
Oh yeah.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Yeah.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.800
There's, there's still people pinging me on Twitter, trying to throw money at me.

31:28.800 --> 31:31.880
What do people, do they suggest what they would use it for when, or you must've heard

31:31.880 --> 31:34.080
some people what they think they would use it for.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.080
That's actually a very good question.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.080
And no, I haven't.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.080
Oh, okay.

31:37.080 --> 31:40.360
Which is really kind of weird.

31:40.360 --> 31:44.160
I look at it and I say, this could be an awesome diagnostics machine.

31:44.160 --> 31:47.920
Like you know, if you're a tech, you bring this on with you to a job site, or I look

31:47.920 --> 31:50.840
at this and think this could be a great way to do network diagnostics because the thing

31:50.840 --> 31:52.600
could just fits in your pocket.

31:52.600 --> 31:53.600
Yeah.

31:53.600 --> 31:55.600
I'd want several, have them all around the house.

31:55.600 --> 31:59.840
What I kind of want to do is like, uh, the, the packaging is always a thing like, do you

31:59.840 --> 32:00.840
do a box?

32:00.840 --> 32:01.840
Do you just throw it in a bag?

32:01.840 --> 32:02.840
Whatever.

32:02.840 --> 32:03.840
I want to do like a blister pack.

32:03.840 --> 32:04.840
There you go.

32:04.840 --> 32:05.840
Yeah.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.640
Like your go bag computer, right?

32:07.640 --> 32:11.200
Like just something that's like emergency computer, good to go, sealed up, ready for

32:11.200 --> 32:12.200
you whenever you need it.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.200
Yeah.

32:13.200 --> 32:17.760
It's something, it's something that you would find on, on just on a wall in the electronics

32:17.760 --> 32:19.200
department on Kmart.

32:19.200 --> 32:23.400
I can totally see it just like in the electronic section, it's up there in some sort of packaging

32:23.400 --> 32:24.400
where it's on the hook.

32:24.400 --> 32:28.520
You pick it up, you pop some batteries in and now you've got yourself a Linux computer

32:28.520 --> 32:29.800
for 30 bucks.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.140
I love it.

32:31.140 --> 32:32.800
So how, how real is this going to be?

32:32.800 --> 32:34.840
Like is this, uh, is this happening?

32:34.840 --> 32:39.120
It's uh, I got some more boards coming from DHL, it should be here.

32:39.120 --> 32:45.720
Well, they just landed in LA, so they might be here tomorrow or the next day, but gotta

32:45.720 --> 32:46.720
get the circuit done.

32:46.720 --> 32:53.640
Then yeah, then you go for funding, which I'm, I'm not sure if I'm going to do a crowdfunding

32:53.640 --> 32:54.640
campaign.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.640
Really?

32:55.640 --> 32:56.640
Yeah.

32:56.640 --> 32:57.640
Pre-sales?

32:57.640 --> 32:58.640
What are you thinking?

32:58.640 --> 33:01.160
My hope is that the next time you hear about this, they're for sale.

33:01.160 --> 33:02.160
Uh-huh.

33:02.160 --> 33:03.160
That would be refreshing.

33:03.160 --> 33:04.160
That sounds hard though.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.160
It's not hard.

33:05.160 --> 33:06.160
It's just expensive.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.160
Oh, okay.

33:07.160 --> 33:10.160
I guess money solves many things, right?

33:10.160 --> 33:11.160
Yeah.

33:11.160 --> 33:15.560
But I mean, with the, with the interest of like, yeah, I can get rid of 5,000 of these

33:15.560 --> 33:16.560
pretty quick.

33:16.560 --> 33:17.560
I bet.

33:17.560 --> 33:18.560
Yeah.

33:18.560 --> 33:19.560
That doesn't surprise me.

33:19.560 --> 33:20.560
Yeah.

33:20.560 --> 33:21.560
Okay.

33:21.560 --> 33:22.560
So you'll have to let me know so then we can put the word out.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.560
Oh yeah.

33:23.560 --> 33:24.560
Yeah.

33:24.560 --> 33:25.560
Well, Brian, it's pretty rad.

33:25.560 --> 33:27.160
We'll have a link in the notes.

33:27.160 --> 33:30.440
So if people are interested in where this goes, just following you on Twitter, one of

33:30.440 --> 33:32.600
the better places to stay in the loop.

33:32.600 --> 33:33.600
Yeah.

33:33.600 --> 33:34.600
Yeah.

33:34.600 --> 33:35.600
Follow me on Twitter.

33:35.600 --> 33:36.600
All right.

33:36.600 --> 33:37.600
Well, we'll send people that way.

33:37.600 --> 33:38.600
Thanks Brian.

33:38.600 --> 33:39.600
All right.

33:39.600 --> 33:40.600
That was great.

33:40.600 --> 33:43.880
A couple of things to clean up around here before we get out of here.

33:43.880 --> 33:45.320
Thank you members.

33:45.320 --> 33:49.360
This is your moment in the show where I say thank you, unpluggedcore.com.

33:49.360 --> 33:54.400
You get some of our best bits in the live stream or you can have a shorter, tighter

33:54.400 --> 33:57.800
Joe produced ad free version of the show.

33:57.800 --> 33:58.800
They're both good.

33:58.800 --> 33:59.800
Yeah.

33:59.800 --> 34:00.800
The Joe one's probably a little better though.

34:00.800 --> 34:01.800
Yeah.

34:01.800 --> 34:02.800
Yeah.

34:02.800 --> 34:03.800
Yeah.

34:03.800 --> 34:04.800
Yeah.

34:04.800 --> 34:05.800
It's you and me screwing around most of the time or you and me and Brent screwing around

34:05.800 --> 34:08.480
in the pre-show and the post-show and chat with the members, but that can be good too.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.400
A lot of things do come up.

34:10.400 --> 34:14.400
You can also support this show and all the shows by going to Jupiter.party.

34:14.400 --> 34:15.400
That's all over there.

34:15.400 --> 34:16.400
You get them in the feeds.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.900
Hey, we like your feedback, your ideas.

34:18.900 --> 34:21.400
We're trying to read them more and more trying to read every single message.

34:21.400 --> 34:25.640
So send them in linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

34:25.640 --> 34:29.640
Also the Luplug goes on Sunday before the show and it's Tuesdays when the show used

34:29.640 --> 34:31.240
to be could, could be used to be.

34:31.240 --> 34:33.800
You can just, just stop in any time.

34:33.800 --> 34:38.160
Check it, you know, get the details at linuxunplugged.com slash mumble.

34:38.160 --> 34:41.600
And for those of you who have been supporting the show with the value for value option in

34:41.600 --> 34:46.560
the new podcast apps at newpodcastapps.com, we're going to do a live stream soon where

34:46.560 --> 34:47.560
we read your boosts.

34:47.560 --> 34:50.780
So if you want to support the show and send us a message you can do with the new value

34:50.780 --> 34:51.780
for value feature.

34:51.780 --> 34:56.320
If you don't know what I'm talking about, go get a new podcast app that supports value

34:56.320 --> 35:01.520
at newpodcastapps.com.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.120
Well we got some great feedback this week.

35:03.120 --> 35:04.120
Thank you everyone.

35:04.120 --> 35:05.120
Um, some was about rats.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.120
Oh boy.

35:06.120 --> 35:07.120
Thanks for that.

35:07.120 --> 35:13.960
And mostly about, um, Ubuntu, which we talked in depth about Linux Unplugged episode number

35:13.960 --> 35:14.960
444.

35:14.960 --> 35:21.440
Um, Jimmy wrote in and said the Linux desktop is just one part of what makes Ubuntu, but

35:21.440 --> 35:22.440
it's solid enough.

35:22.440 --> 35:25.080
It doesn't need to be so edgy to attract users.

35:25.080 --> 35:29.680
My guess is that Ubuntu realized this and puts focused where demand is strong and where

35:29.680 --> 35:33.480
it can better allocate its development resources.

35:33.480 --> 35:37.780
That matches up with my own anecdotes working for a university where I see Ubuntu excelling

35:37.780 --> 35:43.880
in research, robotics, AI, machine learning, and in my own world of systems and networking

35:43.880 --> 35:48.040
engineer where a lot of FOSS projects have strong support for Ubuntu.

35:48.040 --> 35:52.360
Just look at Ubuntu's Twitter feed to get a sense of what they're trying to market.

35:52.360 --> 35:58.080
And so I did have a look at their Twitter feed and guys, it's true.

35:58.080 --> 36:02.680
Post number one was mentioned something about FIPS compliant Ubuntu servers.

36:02.680 --> 36:07.040
Number two was like infrastructure automation with a secure on premises open stack cloud.

36:07.040 --> 36:10.600
Why Ubuntu is the leading choice to replace CentOS for FinServe.

36:10.600 --> 36:13.960
So I think he's sort of suggesting that maybe we missed a little slice of it.

36:13.960 --> 36:14.960
What do you, what do you think?

36:14.960 --> 36:18.320
I don't think what he's saying takes away from what we were saying.

36:18.320 --> 36:19.320
I think it supports.

36:19.320 --> 36:20.320
I think we agree.

36:20.320 --> 36:21.320
Yeah.

36:21.320 --> 36:25.840
It's a secure assessment, but more of that is, I guess the one part is how much they

36:25.840 --> 36:30.040
should or want to be, or we want them to be focusing on the desktop, right?

36:30.040 --> 36:32.200
He's basically saying, oh, there's all this other stuff they're doing.

36:32.200 --> 36:34.400
And we're saying, well, yeah, there's all this other stuff they're doing.

36:34.400 --> 36:35.920
Feels like they've taken their eye off the desktop.

36:35.920 --> 36:36.920
Right.

36:36.920 --> 36:37.920
And here's the results.

36:37.920 --> 36:38.920
Whether or not you care about that.

36:38.920 --> 36:39.920
Yeah.

36:39.920 --> 36:40.920
That's where it, I think it comes down to opinion.

36:40.920 --> 36:43.720
Well, and I think the other thing that I walked away from that episode thinking more about

36:43.720 --> 36:49.080
it and I, I do have the sense that Canonical is doing something about it.

36:49.080 --> 36:53.840
Like documentation, investing in documentation is a very public facing thing.

36:53.840 --> 36:57.680
And it's a very, I think it supports the industries that just listed off.

36:57.680 --> 37:00.480
Well, and especially for something that's, you know, such a dominant product at the moment

37:00.480 --> 37:03.720
and where people are, you know, you already have some of that feeling of like, oh, when

37:03.720 --> 37:06.680
I search for a problem on Linux, I'm going to get like a bunch of help and answers for

37:06.680 --> 37:07.680
it.

37:07.680 --> 37:08.680
And so the docs are also really good.

37:08.680 --> 37:09.680
Yeah.

37:09.680 --> 37:12.320
And this, I think this focus is paying off dividends in some ways too.

37:12.320 --> 37:16.240
Like they have some of the best raspberry PI support of the distros of the desktop distros

37:16.240 --> 37:17.840
out there.

37:17.840 --> 37:22.440
You know, it made that Ubuntu Unity great because they've worked on that.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.160
They've made that a great experience.

37:24.160 --> 37:28.240
I walked away from the episode hoping that maybe we're seeing some signs though, that

37:28.240 --> 37:33.720
they're also going to expand that focus to include making the desktop a little more compelling.

37:33.720 --> 37:36.360
I don't know, but that's my sense of it.

37:36.360 --> 37:40.960
There's like something in the works, but yeah, I think that was actually a very, a very astute

37:40.960 --> 37:41.960
analysis, Jimmy.

37:41.960 --> 37:46.900
I suppose there is also the element of, you know, we see the wider range of what's out

37:46.900 --> 37:47.900
there as well.

37:47.900 --> 37:52.040
So if you just, for those folks that Ubuntu works and you stick with it, I mean, I don't

37:52.040 --> 37:55.120
think what we were trying to say is taking away from that it's not, that it's not a good

37:55.120 --> 37:57.040
experience or like meets those use cases.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.080
It's just that there's a lot of other interesting things going on.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.080
Yeah.

38:00.080 --> 38:03.960
Both Dave and Mike wrote in with similar ideas that maybe might be interesting to us.

38:03.960 --> 38:08.240
Dave writes, the enthusiast base seems to want something akin to the Windows Insider

38:08.240 --> 38:11.600
program or Arch for Ubuntu perhaps.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.200
The latest features as fast as possible.

38:14.200 --> 38:18.800
I know I want that, but I also know that waiting six months for an interim release of Ubuntu

38:18.800 --> 38:20.880
is really what I need.

38:20.880 --> 38:23.040
And so Mike wrote something similar.

38:23.040 --> 38:27.520
He just says maybe canonical spinoffs of fedora like versions of Ubuntu with newer stuff,

38:27.520 --> 38:31.120
perhaps an Ubuntu enterprise and Ubuntu desktop to come down the road.

38:31.120 --> 38:32.640
Well, you kind of have that, right?

38:32.640 --> 38:37.240
You have the interim releases and then you have the LTS releases and Dave touches on

38:37.240 --> 38:38.240
it too.

38:38.240 --> 38:39.240
People like really fresh stuff.

38:39.240 --> 38:46.280
There have been different goes at like rolling Ubuntu based on the dailies, but they don't

38:46.280 --> 38:47.920
really seem to last those projects.

38:47.920 --> 38:48.920
Unless I'm wrong.

38:48.920 --> 38:52.200
I think they've all kind of faded away, but you could in theory go get the latest dev

38:52.200 --> 38:57.240
builds and just install all the updates from the repo.

38:57.240 --> 39:00.480
And then write in and let us know how it goes.

39:00.480 --> 39:02.800
I'll tell you it can't be any worse than rawhide.

39:02.800 --> 39:07.120
Every time I try rawhide, it just blows up in my face.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.300
What are the chances, right?

39:08.300 --> 39:09.300
What are the chances?

39:09.300 --> 39:11.160
I'm sure it works great for everybody else.

39:11.160 --> 39:16.200
And for another last quick one, Advait wrote in and said, I'm a newbie using Ubuntu 2110

39:16.200 --> 39:17.360
and it's great.

39:17.360 --> 39:19.800
It does everything I want my OS to do.

39:19.800 --> 39:22.480
I can easily set up my workflows just the way I want.

39:22.480 --> 39:23.480
What's not to love?

39:23.480 --> 39:25.240
The Ubuntu communities are great.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.400
I get lots of support when I need it.

39:27.400 --> 39:30.800
And unless I'm wrong, Ubuntu has the widest range of quality repos.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.480
That's very important to me.

39:32.480 --> 39:34.560
So clearly a lot of people are really happy.

39:34.560 --> 39:42.720
I think what I got out of the feedback mostly was that some of what we've noticed Ubuntu

39:42.720 --> 39:47.280
doing in the last, I don't know, several years, we could explain in words.

39:47.280 --> 39:53.320
And some of it was just kind of this feeling that Ubuntu is changing a little bit.

39:53.320 --> 39:54.640
Was that the feeling you guys got?

39:54.640 --> 39:58.000
No, I mean, I think I could, I think I could quantify it pretty easily.

39:58.000 --> 40:02.560
I mean, we saw them recently slip behind in the GNOME desktop in GTK when, you know, the

40:02.560 --> 40:05.800
whole thing about going back to GNOME seemed like they were going to be shipping upstream

40:05.800 --> 40:06.800
GNOME.

40:06.800 --> 40:10.400
And I know they had issues getting the theme ready or the community did.

40:10.400 --> 40:13.880
And so that was the reason we were given that there was, he wasn't ready for the Ubuntu

40:13.880 --> 40:16.800
experience, but that's just another way of saying they didn't have enough engineering

40:16.800 --> 40:17.800
time.

40:17.800 --> 40:23.320
And I think we've also seen it just in the way recently the community has begun sort

40:23.320 --> 40:25.320
of talking about everything but Ubuntu.

40:25.320 --> 40:31.120
I think that was the big red flag for me is more and more Ubuntu isn't even a suggestion

40:31.120 --> 40:33.840
for a distro for people to run.

40:33.840 --> 40:38.520
And I can't believe that we have seen a shift to arch-based distros getting recommended

40:38.520 --> 40:39.520
to new users.

40:39.520 --> 40:43.080
I, you know, a year and a half ago sat here and said, nobody's doing that.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.760
And then here we are, people are doing it.

40:44.760 --> 40:50.400
And it's unbelievable how fast things have shifted in the last two years.

40:50.400 --> 40:54.580
It seems to be an accelerating situation.

40:54.580 --> 40:58.520
But also it seems the canonicals putting their foot on the pedal a little more.

40:58.520 --> 41:02.460
I also do want to acknowledge, yeah, it works great still.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.200
We have three Ubuntu systems in this room.

41:05.200 --> 41:06.920
They work great.

41:06.920 --> 41:08.240
Like I acknowledge that.

41:08.240 --> 41:10.840
Yeah, I run Kubuntu every day on my system as well.

41:10.840 --> 41:12.780
And I got to say for the most part, it runs great.

41:12.780 --> 41:15.000
So we are huge fans, I think.

41:15.000 --> 41:19.980
Yeah, I think it's more about the discontent you're seeing around snaps and the way that's

41:19.980 --> 41:20.980
been deployed.

41:20.980 --> 41:25.720
It's more about the adoption stats you're seeing, like for the Linux gamers that we

41:25.720 --> 41:33.080
saw on the Steam stats and on the Proton stats that clearly show that Arch-based distros

41:33.080 --> 41:39.160
are eating away at Ubuntu's market share at a just trend line that is continuing to only

41:39.160 --> 41:41.140
go in one direction.

41:41.140 --> 41:45.600
And then you also see it in our Tuxy stats when people voted, Ubuntu struggled to be

41:45.600 --> 41:53.240
represented in any category where other distributions like Fedora dominated pretty strongly.

41:53.240 --> 41:55.760
And that's a huge flip for our community.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.880
I can't really overstate that point.

41:58.880 --> 42:03.000
This show was even for a time possibly described as anti-Fedora.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.440
I mean, that's kind of putting it harsh.

42:05.440 --> 42:11.800
But early on, it was very critical of things that I felt weren't fully baked, but my opinion

42:11.800 --> 42:12.800
was not static.

42:12.800 --> 42:17.560
I mean, I changed it as the distribution changed.

42:17.560 --> 42:21.020
And I think it's reflected in the community overall.

42:21.020 --> 42:24.880
And I think when you look at who is driving the most important initiatives in the Linux

42:24.880 --> 42:31.320
desktop, specifically from a development standpoint, a lot of that, not all of it, but a lot of

42:31.320 --> 42:35.200
it's coming from Red Hat, especially lately, the past year and a half or whatever.

42:35.200 --> 42:40.280
I mean, we saw a lot of ass kicking when Canonical announced they were switching over to GNOME

42:40.280 --> 42:44.600
and then all of a sudden, boom, Ninja Patch, boom, Ninja Patch, boom, Ninja Patch.

42:44.600 --> 42:48.960
It seems like that period of low hanging fruit or whatever you want to call it has passed.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.920
And that's been very beneficial.

42:50.920 --> 42:53.200
It's really helped GNOME be a much better project.

42:53.200 --> 42:54.200
Yeah, definitely.

42:54.200 --> 42:58.880
But when you're looking at things like PipeWire or other significant innovations that are

42:58.880 --> 43:05.000
enabling things like NVIDIA to use Wayland or HDR support or high resolution, high frame

43:05.000 --> 43:10.560
rate support, like that stuff's coming either from Collabra or from Red Hat or from a few

43:10.560 --> 43:11.560
other outlets.

43:11.560 --> 43:13.480
But Canonical's name isn't on there a lot.

43:13.480 --> 43:14.480
Yeah, that's it, right?

43:14.480 --> 43:20.440
Like, there are exciting developments in the Linux desktop experience and space.

43:20.440 --> 43:23.940
And it feels like maybe Canonical's not necessarily keeping up, you know, so it's not saying an

43:23.940 --> 43:24.940
absolute thing.

43:24.940 --> 43:28.820
It's just like, we're paying attention to rates of change here and noticing Ubuntu seems

43:28.820 --> 43:30.000
to be slowing down a bit.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Right.

43:31.000 --> 43:33.560
But if we shift the conversation to, okay, let's look at the Raspberry Pi.

43:33.560 --> 43:37.480
Well, I would say, well, Fedora's catching up to where Ubuntu is on the Raspberry Pi.

43:37.480 --> 43:38.480
Right.

43:38.480 --> 43:41.220
Or just depending on your focus.

43:41.220 --> 43:45.460
And that is, I think, what we were noting, because it used to be such a strong player

43:45.460 --> 43:46.460
in that space.

43:46.460 --> 43:51.600
There are, as you say, there are things, right, like the hiring about games, the documentation.

43:51.600 --> 43:55.840
I know people have mixed opinions, but I honestly think that their interesting investment

43:55.840 --> 43:59.600
in Flutter is at least a sign of them mixing things up and pursuing a direction.

43:59.600 --> 44:01.080
So there's at least some thought involved.

44:01.080 --> 44:06.840
Yeah, I feel like that's a mixed bag example, though, because it doesn't really benefit

44:06.840 --> 44:07.840
anyone else.

44:07.840 --> 44:12.600
Like if they were like, if they came out and said, we're rewriting our installer, and we're

44:12.600 --> 44:18.360
doing the whole thing in GTK4, it's going to be a Wayland native installer.

44:18.360 --> 44:20.000
How exciting would that be for us?

44:20.000 --> 44:21.560
That'd be very exciting.

44:21.560 --> 44:25.760
And I guess, though, I'm excited about the prospect of them being invested in making

44:25.760 --> 44:26.760
Flutter a better experience.

44:26.760 --> 44:27.760
Yeah.

44:27.760 --> 44:31.360
Because I don't see, I guess I feel like there might be more future interesting apps in that

44:31.360 --> 44:34.280
way than on the GTK4 side.

44:34.280 --> 44:40.240
I would agree with you if a few years down the road, we start seeing a lot of must have

44:40.240 --> 44:41.840
apps that are Flutter based.

44:41.840 --> 44:42.840
Yeah, that's fair.

44:42.840 --> 44:46.440
And if the investments Canonical made in Flutter make it a better experience on the Linux desktop,

44:46.440 --> 44:48.120
then I completely agree with you.

44:48.120 --> 44:52.140
But if we don't see that future, and it's just a few Canonical apps that are Flutter

44:52.140 --> 44:55.800
based, nothing beyond the Ubuntu experience has been gained.

44:55.800 --> 45:00.800
And the problem is, is that we can look back now at a history of Canonical, and we can

45:00.800 --> 45:03.360
see they don't stick with everything forever.

45:03.360 --> 45:04.360
This is true.

45:04.360 --> 45:07.200
They have reasons, reasonable reasons.

45:07.200 --> 45:13.000
But it means that when an innovation is limited to their ecosystem, it's also limited to the

45:13.000 --> 45:17.360
lifetime that Canonical wishes to invest into it.

45:17.360 --> 45:22.280
And that has proved long term not to be the best thing for me to invest into.

45:22.280 --> 45:23.280
You know what I'm saying?

45:23.280 --> 45:26.760
Like, kind of one of the reasons why I've kind of given in and everything's a flat pack

45:26.760 --> 45:29.520
now, even on Ubuntu systems, everything's a flat pack now.

45:29.520 --> 45:33.020
But I guess that to me speaks of a longer term issue.

45:33.020 --> 45:36.400
That's been the story of Canonical over the past decade, not just the past one and a half

45:36.400 --> 45:37.400
years.

45:37.400 --> 45:38.400
Yeah.

45:38.400 --> 45:41.680
So I guess I'm saying there's a return in that activity, but I think maybe the window

45:41.680 --> 45:45.440
where they were really on board with the Canome again, like that was more the exception, perhaps.

45:45.440 --> 45:46.440
Maybe.

45:46.440 --> 45:47.440
I see what you're saying there.

45:47.440 --> 45:50.560
And I could still see Flutter being a pretty smart investment on their standpoint, because

45:50.560 --> 45:52.880
Google is obviously heavily invested in that.

45:52.880 --> 45:53.880
But you're right.

45:53.880 --> 45:54.880
It is kind of a wild card.

45:54.880 --> 45:55.880
Who knows?

45:55.880 --> 45:59.240
It could very well end up being we tried two trial apps and then abandoned them.

45:59.240 --> 46:00.980
Yeah, maybe.

46:00.980 --> 46:04.160
Or they only ever ship on Ubuntu for as long as they're used to ship them.

46:04.160 --> 46:06.120
But anyways, we love the conversation.

46:06.120 --> 46:10.680
Thanks for getting us thinking Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact to send them in for

46:10.680 --> 46:13.180
next week.

46:13.180 --> 46:18.280
This is a pick out there for a lot of the mom and dads or people that are not mom and

46:18.280 --> 46:19.280
dads, I guess.

46:19.280 --> 46:22.480
But this is a way to get Minecraft easily working on Linux.

46:22.480 --> 46:26.760
And I say mom and dads because this is well, Dylan's actually been taking this over from

46:26.760 --> 46:27.760
me.

46:27.760 --> 46:28.760
It's kind of proud.

46:28.760 --> 46:29.760
But this has been my job.

46:29.760 --> 46:30.760
Right.

46:30.760 --> 46:33.360
Dad helps them helps all the kids get Minecraft working on their computers.

46:33.360 --> 46:39.480
And one of the problems with Minecraft is there is this whole world of mods and terms.

46:39.480 --> 46:41.840
And so your kid starts because their friends have them.

46:41.840 --> 46:45.320
So your kid starts asking you and you're like, I don't even know what you're talking about.

46:45.320 --> 46:47.340
This app helps manage all of that for you.

46:47.340 --> 46:49.640
And it's a brand new one because some of the other ones have begun to fade.

46:49.640 --> 46:51.840
It's got kind of a it's not a great name.

46:51.840 --> 46:52.840
It's called RPM Launcher.

46:52.840 --> 46:53.840
Yeah.

46:53.840 --> 46:54.840
I mean, you know what?

46:54.840 --> 46:55.840
I thought this was going to be.

46:55.840 --> 46:56.840
Yeah.

46:56.840 --> 46:57.840
Me too, actually.

46:57.840 --> 47:02.360
But no, it's a better Minecraft launcher that supports the multiple platforms.

47:02.360 --> 47:07.120
Like if you need certain mods and mod packs with certain versions of, you know, whatever

47:07.120 --> 47:09.680
they have all these names, it'll grab all that stuff for you.

47:09.680 --> 47:10.680
You'll get the right version of Java.

47:10.680 --> 47:12.040
It'll get the right version of Minecraft.

47:12.040 --> 47:15.160
It supports your Mojang or Xbox account if you already converted it.

47:15.160 --> 47:18.320
Well, it's all in and it's also available as a flat pack.

47:18.320 --> 47:22.160
So it's pretty easy to get set up on just about any freaking Linux box you want.

47:22.160 --> 47:23.400
And you know what else?

47:23.400 --> 47:24.400
Did you notice?

47:24.400 --> 47:25.400
I just did.

47:25.400 --> 47:26.400
All right.

47:26.400 --> 47:29.200
Tell the people it's written in Flutter.

47:29.200 --> 47:31.080
You see how it all gets tied together?

47:31.080 --> 47:32.080
That is.

47:32.080 --> 47:33.080
There you go.

47:33.080 --> 47:34.200
Isn't that great?

47:34.200 --> 47:38.440
And so as a result, it is also available as an app image, a portable binary.

47:38.440 --> 47:43.320
It's in the AUR and it's available for Windows and Mac and Snaps.

47:43.320 --> 47:44.320
Wow.

47:44.320 --> 47:45.320
This is really.

47:45.320 --> 47:46.320
You can get this thing anywhere.

47:46.320 --> 47:47.320
That's great.

47:47.320 --> 47:48.320
Yeah.

47:48.320 --> 47:49.320
So that is pretty nice.

47:49.320 --> 47:50.320
So there you go.

47:50.320 --> 47:54.240
For any of you out there that are struggling with Minecraft or even like for me, I went

47:54.240 --> 47:57.040
deep and it turns out that that time paid off.

47:57.040 --> 47:58.400
You're like a certified Minecraft administrator now.

47:58.400 --> 47:59.640
Hey, man, I can do mods.

47:59.640 --> 48:01.400
I can even help modify textures.

48:01.400 --> 48:02.400
Yeah.

48:02.400 --> 48:03.400
Oh, yeah.

48:03.400 --> 48:04.400
Yeah.

48:04.400 --> 48:05.400
Yeah.

48:05.400 --> 48:06.400
And you know what?

48:06.400 --> 48:09.040
I've converted multiple Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts now because you got to.

48:09.040 --> 48:10.960
They're like forcing you to do it.

48:10.960 --> 48:12.280
Let me tell you what.

48:12.280 --> 48:16.920
But the one thing that kind of sucks that died off is there was a launcher for Minecraft's

48:16.920 --> 48:18.880
Bedrock, which is like the Windows only.

48:18.880 --> 48:19.880
Right.

48:19.880 --> 48:20.880
The newer one.

48:20.880 --> 48:22.120
And they made it available for Android.

48:22.120 --> 48:28.680
So some some brilliant person out there made this whole Android VM wrapper that downloads.

48:28.680 --> 48:29.680
You have to pay for it.

48:29.680 --> 48:30.680
Legit.

48:30.680 --> 48:36.320
It downloads the Minecraft launcher and runs it in Android VM totally transparently.

48:36.320 --> 48:37.320
Wow.

48:37.320 --> 48:39.720
But the guy burned out or they burned out.

48:39.720 --> 48:43.640
And so if anybody knows of a way to do that, let us know at Linux Unplugged dot com slash

48:43.640 --> 48:44.640
contact.

48:44.640 --> 48:47.880
Because that would that would that's the one thing that's missing now.

48:47.880 --> 48:48.880
Next level.

48:48.880 --> 48:49.880
Yeah.

48:49.880 --> 48:52.120
He's like, Dad, is it OK if I boot into Windows to play Minecraft Bedrock?

48:52.120 --> 48:53.840
My friends are, you know, that story.

48:53.840 --> 48:55.040
My friends are doing it.

48:55.040 --> 48:56.040
They're all playing Bedrock.

48:56.040 --> 49:00.920
And I'm like, oh, all right, it's hard out there.

49:00.920 --> 49:01.920
It's hard out there.

49:01.920 --> 49:05.600
Hey, if you want more show, if you're missing some of the news, if you're in the industry,

We'll break things down for you.

49:23.840 --> 49:24.840
We got you.

49:24.840 --> 49:26.640
So we'll be back on Sunday at noon Pacific.

49:26.640 --> 49:31.700
You can join us then or get it any time you like at Linux Unplugged dot com slash subscribe

49:31.700 --> 49:36.240
links at Linux Unplugged dot com slash four four five and we'll see you right back here

49:36.240 --> 50:00.160
next Sunday.

50:06.240 --> 50:17.280
All right, let's go boat.

50:17.280 --> 50:20.840
Let's go pick a title here for this show, JB titles dot com.

50:20.840 --> 50:25.000
Hey, so what do you guys think about Discord and open source?

50:25.000 --> 50:28.920
I know this is a third rail conversation we've touched on before, but it's come up again

50:28.920 --> 50:33.360
recently in our community that perhaps we should consider consolidating our chat platforms

50:33.360 --> 50:37.480
and maybe Telegram isn't the right platform anymore and something like Discord that has

50:37.480 --> 50:39.520
individual channels is.

50:39.520 --> 50:43.160
And the nice thing about Discord is we could also pretty easily bridge it to our matrix

50:43.160 --> 50:44.160
system.

50:44.160 --> 50:46.240
Just a couple of rooms like the general chat.

50:46.240 --> 50:47.640
It's usually a pretty good experience.

50:47.640 --> 50:49.160
I have heard that is one of the better bridges.

50:49.160 --> 50:51.040
I've not tried it myself.

50:51.040 --> 50:55.640
So a reminder, Chris, that Discord is breaking bridges.

50:55.640 --> 50:57.240
Oh, what?

50:57.240 --> 50:58.680
We discussed this before.

50:58.680 --> 51:01.120
I completely forgot.

51:01.120 --> 51:02.880
Well, that's well, there you go.

51:02.880 --> 51:06.600
You know, this is the problem is there's a lot of there's a lot of community pressure

51:06.600 --> 51:08.800
to use Discord, but then these kinds of things happen.

51:08.800 --> 51:13.200
It's like how many times do we have to go through the lesson of a hosted platform that's

51:13.200 --> 51:14.500
not run by us?

51:14.500 --> 51:16.720
Always inevitably bites us in the butt.

51:16.720 --> 51:20.760
Technically, all bridges are against Discord's terms of service because you're not allowed

51:20.760 --> 51:28.160
to interact or interface with the Discord system through not a Discord client, man.

51:28.160 --> 51:33.720
So it's always been a little bit of a gray area or looking the other way.

51:33.720 --> 51:38.320
Yeah, they basically broke that by saying this API is going away in the beginning of

51:38.320 --> 51:39.320
April.

51:39.320 --> 51:41.840
All of your bridges are going to all your bots are going to break.

51:41.840 --> 51:45.760
I'm surprised to see Discord still going so strong in the open source community.

51:45.760 --> 51:50.480
It really it does seem like it's gained picked up a lot of traction is continuing to pick

51:50.480 --> 51:51.520
up traction.

51:51.520 --> 51:56.520
It depends on the subculture, really, like if they're if they're closer oriented towards

51:56.520 --> 52:01.300
gamers and entertainment and things like that, then, yeah, they tend to use Discord.

52:01.300 --> 52:06.880
But outside of that space, I've generally been seeing a shift towards using Matrix.

52:06.880 --> 52:07.880
Definitely.

52:07.880 --> 52:08.880
Seen more of that.

52:08.880 --> 52:09.880
Yep.

52:09.880 --> 52:11.680
It's frustrating how I mean, this is a problem in many things, right?

52:11.680 --> 52:14.240
Like so many open source projects, at least for a while, that seems to getting a little

52:14.240 --> 52:18.040
better by like using Slack, for instance, and having these closed effects.

52:18.040 --> 52:19.040
It's a network effect, right?

52:19.040 --> 52:22.640
Because you're already in Slack or you're already in Discord, so you can just join one

52:22.640 --> 52:23.800
more so easily.

52:23.800 --> 52:25.720
But boy, for the outsiders, not a great experience.

52:25.720 --> 52:28.920
I know I've seen a couple like I wanted to watch someone who's doing a live podcast recording,

52:28.920 --> 52:30.080
but they're only streaming on Discord.

52:30.080 --> 52:32.240
Like, I'm not I know signing in for that.

52:32.240 --> 52:33.240
Same thing.

52:33.240 --> 52:34.240
Same thing.

52:34.240 --> 52:35.240
I went now.

52:35.240 --> 52:36.240
No, no, no.

52:36.240 --> 52:37.240
Thanks.

52:37.240 --> 52:38.240
Yeah.

52:38.240 --> 52:39.240
I just want to I just want it on a Web page.

52:39.240 --> 52:43.440
Discord has a lot of specific features that make it nice for content creators, especially

52:43.440 --> 52:49.680
around the pivot streaming feature that allows them to do things like attach tooling to do.

52:49.680 --> 52:53.480
You know, when they do live streams to their YouTube or Twitter, even inside of Discord,

52:53.480 --> 52:55.080
they can do the reaction stuff.

52:55.080 --> 53:01.080
They can trigger animations based on speech and other reaction type stuff.

53:01.080 --> 53:04.960
It's they're good, too, about like integrating with things like Patreon and doing perks.

53:04.960 --> 53:05.960
Yeah.

53:05.960 --> 53:06.960
Yeah.

53:06.960 --> 53:09.920
I don't really have any complaints about like the actual once you're in there.

53:09.920 --> 53:10.920
Yeah.

53:10.920 --> 53:11.920
Experience.

53:11.920 --> 53:16.160
There is an open source project that you can put on a Web page where you load the Web

53:16.160 --> 53:18.980
page and you can just start chatting.

53:18.980 --> 53:22.400
Something Wes and I've been talking about off air about something playing with soon.

53:22.400 --> 53:26.160
And that, you know, then it's really going to be what do we do with the IRC room after

53:26.160 --> 53:27.160
that?

53:27.160 --> 53:32.760
Well, the IRC room, if we have people who want our diehard IRC people, if you were to

53:32.760 --> 53:40.500
move that to, you know, Libera chat or somewhere else, then we can bridge that.

53:40.500 --> 53:45.360
And so it wouldn't matter if they're on IRC or if they're on Matrix.

53:45.360 --> 53:56.440
It's for people who like to mess with computers.
