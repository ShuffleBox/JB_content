WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
I present you the perfect pet. It is OpenCat. It's a GPL3 highly programmable and maneuverable

00:09.000 --> 00:16.520
robotic cat that's powered by AI and 3D printing with a Raspberry Pi for extra flavor.

00:16.520 --> 00:17.520
Well isn't that neat?

00:17.520 --> 00:20.600
This is, oh they got a video. Should we roll the, should we roll the live dice?

00:20.600 --> 00:21.600
Oh yeah, let's check it out.

00:21.600 --> 00:22.600
Okay here we go.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.880
Is it creepy or cute? That's what we want to know.

00:23.880 --> 00:33.600
The OpenCat demo. Oh boy. Oh boy. So it's crawling. It looks like a kid's robotic toy.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.920
It does, yeah.

00:34.920 --> 00:39.640
It does have the ability to get itself back up when it gets knocked over.

00:39.640 --> 00:40.640
That'll be useful.

00:40.640 --> 00:45.520
Here's version two. You know I gotta say, version two's looking a lot better. They really,

00:45.520 --> 00:48.520
they're really committed to this thing, Wes. They're really committed to this thing.

00:48.520 --> 00:52.480
I mean it is pretty, pretty impressive. Now I don't know that I want to have it like around

00:52.480 --> 00:55.120
my house if I didn't, didn't build it, but.

00:55.120 --> 00:58.720
Right, or when you're sleeping would you always make sure to turn it off? I mean think about

00:58.720 --> 01:03.160
that for a second. Do you want some robot cat ramp? Because a real cat, they roam around

01:03.160 --> 01:06.520
the house at night. You can respect the project here on this.

01:06.520 --> 01:09.840
Maybe you could turn it into like a robo-cat security droid.

01:09.840 --> 01:12.720
Maybe mount a laser on there?

01:12.720 --> 01:14.320
Oh yeah.

01:14.320 --> 01:31.440
This is Linux Unplugged episode 238 for February 27th, 2018.

01:31.440 --> 01:36.560
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that is covered in barbecue and

01:36.560 --> 01:39.600
been cleaning up dog poo. My name is Chris.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.600
My name is Wes.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.360
It's one of those pre-shows, Wes, good and bad. Good and bad.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.560
We made it. We're here. The show must go on.

01:45.560 --> 01:49.560
We fired up the barbecue pre-show for the first time. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:49.560 --> 01:50.680
The grill.

01:50.680 --> 01:55.680
For the first time and we had to feed ourselves to prepare our bodies to cover all of the

01:55.680 --> 02:00.960
community news that we've got this week. I feel like this should be a nice, calm, relaxing

02:00.960 --> 02:06.680
Linux Unplugged that will wander through before I head off to scale. I need something low-key

02:06.680 --> 02:07.680
because the next week.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.680
Take it easy, recharge.

02:08.680 --> 02:13.240
It's going to be crazy. It's going to be crazy. Going down to Pasadena, California. So we're

02:13.240 --> 02:19.300
going to go through just a few bits, a couple of apps, some nice community news, an update

02:19.300 --> 02:20.300
on XFCE.

02:20.300 --> 02:24.800
Did you know there actually is some progress on the XFCE desktop? Yes. Yes, they're nearly

02:24.800 --> 02:28.980
to GTK3. We'll tell you all about that, their current status. Our buddy Wimpy's here with

02:28.980 --> 02:35.640
a pretty cool option for Ubuntu Mate installers for 1804 coming up. And the crew over at KDMLive

02:35.640 --> 02:41.960
has a killer new release that's in the works that might just give Final Cut a run for its

02:41.960 --> 02:42.960
money.

02:42.960 --> 02:47.320
Then we'll check in on that poll about dropping Discord and switching back to IRC, see what

02:47.320 --> 02:51.680
the results were. And then, Wes, it's time to bring a little freedom to your vehicle.

02:51.680 --> 02:52.680
Finally.

02:52.680 --> 02:56.520
I've been debating this myself. Should I get one of them like, you know, Android auto dashes

02:56.520 --> 03:00.480
because my radio needs to be replaced. It's bad. And I'm like, yeah, maybe I'll do that.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.240
But then I don't want to be locked into like one particular hardware vendor, and they're

03:03.240 --> 03:06.640
probably not going to update it properly, and it's probably going to be underpowered.

03:06.640 --> 03:11.880
So I've never really pulled the trigger on like upgrading my car sound system. But friends,

03:11.880 --> 03:16.560
if you wait long enough, the open source community always provides a solution.

03:16.560 --> 03:21.960
So this week, we're going to talk about Crankshaft, which is a turnkey Linux distribution for

03:21.960 --> 03:29.040
the Raspberry Pi that transforms it into an Android auto headset. All you need is a Raspberry

03:29.040 --> 03:34.860
Pi 3 board and the official Raspberry Pi 7 inch touchscreen, which is like 60 US dollars.

03:34.860 --> 03:39.120
And then you got a turnkey Linux distro. We'll tell you about it. Yeah. Have you heard of

03:39.120 --> 03:40.120
Crankshaft, Wes?

03:40.120 --> 03:41.120
No, I have not.

03:41.120 --> 03:45.480
Well, you will hear more about it coming up. But let's start with some community news.

03:45.480 --> 03:50.140
This has been sort of leaking out in bits and details here and there. Corbin Davenport

03:50.140 --> 03:56.640
over at Android police.com writes that it looks like Chrome OS may soon be able to run

03:56.640 --> 04:00.840
Linux applications in a container. Of course, you're probably thinking, well, why does that

04:00.840 --> 04:05.800
have to do in a container? Chrome OS is based on Linux. Well, I'm sure it's many reasons,

04:05.800 --> 04:09.920
security being one of them. It looks like this is coming from some documentation that's leaked

04:09.920 --> 04:15.680
out. And if you go to Chrome Unboxed, they have a Chrome OS developer who uploaded two

04:15.680 --> 04:19.840
screenshots of the container feature and what it will look like. You should get a pop up

04:19.840 --> 04:23.780
that comes up with a description that says, would you like to develop on your Chromebook?

04:23.780 --> 04:28.080
You can run your favorite Linux apps in command line tools seamlessly and securely. And then

04:28.080 --> 04:30.920
it gives you a couple of prompts to install terminal.

04:30.920 --> 04:35.920
Ooh, yeah, that I like that reminds me of the subsystem for Linux. It's like a freedom

04:35.920 --> 04:41.440
box right there. Doesn't this kind of remind you? Yeah, it's like Google's answer to the

04:41.440 --> 04:45.560
subsystem for Linux on Windows for Chrome OS. Does that make sense? It's like that they're

04:45.560 --> 04:49.240
trying to be competitive with that feature on Windows. Well, I mean, it kind of targets

04:49.240 --> 04:53.440
that splits the difference. You can still have a simple platform for most end users,

04:53.440 --> 04:58.440
but your developers or other people that need a little bit extra, that option is there.

04:58.440 --> 05:02.560
Is it actually usable though? That would really be my question. That's a good question. Are

05:02.560 --> 05:06.360
Chromebooks fast enough? I don't know. Let's ask the Mumble Room. Time appropriate greetings

05:06.360 --> 05:08.160
there, Mumble Room. Welcome to the show, guys.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.160
G'day.

05:09.160 --> 05:10.160
Hello.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.160
Hello.

05:11.160 --> 05:15.960
Snuck it in there. You didn't know when I was going to do it, did you? I surprised you.

05:15.960 --> 05:16.960
Get it out of here.

05:16.960 --> 05:20.080
So Wimpy, what do you think of this? Do you think this would actually make Chromebooks

05:20.080 --> 05:24.880
a viable solution? The thing that crossed my mind is students. Like my son has a Chromebook

05:24.880 --> 05:27.360
provided by his school.

05:27.360 --> 05:33.360
I think anything that enables people to experiment with Linux in an accessible way is a good

05:33.360 --> 05:35.880
thing, particularly for students.

05:35.880 --> 05:40.400
Yeah. And I could see too, like if you've got a limited budget or whatever, or it's

05:40.400 --> 05:44.720
like again, it's provided. It just sort of opens up a whole new range of functionality.

05:44.720 --> 05:49.240
And I wonder what the limits will be. That's really going to be the question. How far will

05:49.240 --> 05:51.760
Google let you take this? What are they going to make available? Is it only just going to

05:51.760 --> 05:55.840
be a couple of things? Terminal is interesting. That makes sense.

05:55.840 --> 05:56.840
That's a big start, yeah.

05:56.840 --> 05:59.160
Yeah. And then if it's all contained, they don't have to worry about you mucking around

05:59.160 --> 06:02.160
with Chrome OS. So check that out. We'll have a link in the show notes. Anybody else in

06:02.160 --> 06:05.600
the Mumbroom if you have anything to add? If you're a Chromebook user, I'd be particularly

06:05.600 --> 06:06.600
interested.

06:06.600 --> 06:15.000
But I'm not a Chrome OS user. I am still reluctantly an Evernote user. And this is, I don't know,

06:15.000 --> 06:21.600
how many different Evernote clients or Evernote alternatives or Evernote killers that we have

06:21.600 --> 06:27.080
covered on this show. But we have one more. One more because the question still comes

06:27.080 --> 06:31.440
in. And if you're like me, you're still stuck with this thing, especially when you travel.

06:31.440 --> 06:36.760
It's called Tusk. It's an Evernote client. And it seems to actually connect to the Evernote

06:36.760 --> 06:43.640
backend. It's also available as a snap. They say they've improved integration with Linux.

06:43.640 --> 06:44.800
That seems like a good thing.

06:44.800 --> 06:45.800
That's great.

06:45.800 --> 06:52.400
It's got some markdown sheet support. I haven't tried it myself because I still haven't decided

06:52.400 --> 06:59.240
if I'm going to just quit Evernote cold turkey or not. But it does look pretty compelling.

06:59.240 --> 07:03.880
And Joey over at OMG Ubuntu wrote a pretty good write up that kind of makes me want to

07:03.880 --> 07:05.080
give it a go again. It looks good.

07:05.080 --> 07:06.080
If you look at the video.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.080
It is sharp looking.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.080
Yeah.

07:08.080 --> 07:13.200
It actually looks better than the official Evernote client. So this is almost Tusk is

07:13.200 --> 07:16.160
almost taken to the point where it's like, I don't even want Evernote. I don't even need

07:16.160 --> 07:20.480
them to. This looks even better than what they're done. I'm good.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.040
And it's just a snap away.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.600
Just a freaking snap away. Have you tried it? Wimpy, it's a snap. Aren't you obligated

07:25.600 --> 07:26.600
to try all snaps?

07:26.600 --> 07:27.600
In the contract.

07:27.600 --> 07:33.800
I actually hope he's been working on that one. So I've not installed that one yet. But

07:33.800 --> 07:37.580
then again, I don't use Evernote. So I've got no real need to.

07:37.580 --> 07:40.920
Good on you for avoiding that trap.

07:40.920 --> 07:47.120
I got into it like poison when mobile was brand new. And I just assumed they'd just

07:47.120 --> 07:51.080
assume they'd eventually get something for Linux. And I was I regret that decision. But

07:51.080 --> 07:54.120
damn, if it doesn't have some of the best OCR features, like when I'm traveling, I can

07:54.120 --> 07:58.600
take pictures of signs of places that I need to note for like show reference or just for

07:58.600 --> 08:02.120
travel purposes. That is extremely valuable for me.

08:02.120 --> 08:06.480
So maybe Tusk will solve that. We'll see. Maybe I'll give it a go once I get back because

08:06.480 --> 08:09.040
I'm probably going to end up using Evernote on my phone while I'm traveling. It almost

08:09.040 --> 08:11.080
always happens, you know, reservation stuff.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.280
It's just easy. It's there. It works.

08:13.280 --> 08:17.520
I tell you what, Wes, tell you what. Let's talk about something else. Something to pick

08:17.520 --> 08:23.120
me back up. Improving laptop battery life. This is some work that the Fedora project

08:23.120 --> 08:27.460
has been putting in. And they've outlined some of the ways that they're trying to enable

08:27.460 --> 08:32.120
various hardware power saving features by default in Fedora. So one of the things that

08:32.120 --> 08:34.880
they're implementing, and maybe we're going to see this in other distributions too, I

08:34.880 --> 08:37.880
would assume, but right now Fedora is the one that's talking about it. They're going

08:37.880 --> 08:44.480
to make a new satellite power management policy, which actually mirrors the Windows defaults.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.240
Surprisingly is often a good way to go when it comes to some of this hardware power management

08:48.240 --> 08:53.640
stuff. Enable Intel HDA codec power saving by default with a one second timeout, which

08:53.640 --> 08:58.640
saves 0.4 watts of power on an idle laptop. That's a huge amount really. And by the way,

08:58.640 --> 09:03.680
the satellite power management could save up to 1.5 watts of power on an idle laptop.

09:03.680 --> 09:04.680
That's a sweet deal.

09:04.680 --> 09:09.600
That's a big deal right there. And then enable USB auto suspend for USB Bluetooth receivers

09:09.600 --> 09:16.360
by default. We'll see how that goes. Which could also save 0.4 watts. And I like that

09:16.360 --> 09:20.020
they actually put numbers on this stuff. When you add all that up though, it could be a

09:20.020 --> 09:23.600
pretty decent battery savings on Fedora, which could really kind of make the distro stand

09:23.600 --> 09:28.600
out. And I like that they're enunciating all of the stuff they're doing over here on the

09:28.600 --> 09:29.600
Wiki.

09:29.600 --> 09:34.160
And that stuff takes tuning, and so it's nice to be explicit about it.

09:34.160 --> 09:39.400
Look at this too. They have this table, I guess, of the SATA power link management policy

09:39.400 --> 09:45.720
changes testing. And so they have Dell laptops, and HP laptops, and Lenovo laptops, and Asus

09:45.720 --> 09:53.040
Zenbooks on here as well. And it's legit. It's pretty legitimate. So they have comparisons

09:53.040 --> 09:58.800
before and after. So I'll just pink out. Let's say the ThinkPad T400, for example, we're

09:58.800 --> 10:05.640
using an SSD. Before their tweaks on idle, it was sitting there taking 13.6 watts of

10:05.640 --> 10:12.000
power. After their tweaks, which will just be enabled by default, idle, it drops to 11.8.

10:12.000 --> 10:18.040
So it goes from 13.6 to 11.8 watts. And that could really translate into more minutes on

10:18.040 --> 10:19.040
a battery.

10:19.040 --> 10:22.380
And some of the changes are less dramatic. Some of them are even more dramatic. Some

10:22.380 --> 10:28.280
of them are barely noticeable. One of them that kind of jumps out at me is the Elite

10:28.280 --> 10:36.920
Book, the HP Elite Book 8540W. It goes from 18.8 to 17.9. You know, a point actually.

10:36.920 --> 10:40.320
It's decent actually. They're all noticeable. None of them are actually anything to scoff

10:40.320 --> 10:41.320
at.

10:41.320 --> 10:43.960
They're all savings all take, that's for sure.

10:43.960 --> 10:50.480
They tried on the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 carbon second gen. They tried to enable some of the

10:50.480 --> 10:53.760
SATA link power management stuff, and it produced data corruption.

10:53.760 --> 10:54.760
Whoopsie.

10:54.760 --> 10:55.760
Whoa.

10:55.760 --> 10:56.920
That's a nice thing to know about ahead of time.

10:56.920 --> 11:01.340
So don't go just playing with this stuff maybe. Don't go just trying that on your own distro

11:01.340 --> 11:02.680
to see if it's going to...

11:02.680 --> 11:04.600
Or at least not with data you care about.

11:04.600 --> 11:09.600
But it'd be really interesting to run Fedora 28 on a laptop and then run 27 and see if

11:09.600 --> 11:14.840
I could actually just perceive a difference, not have to measure, but can I just perceive

11:14.840 --> 11:15.840
it?

11:15.840 --> 11:17.000
Yeah, does it feel different to the end user?

11:17.000 --> 11:21.520
Yeah. And what's nice about this is it doesn't require a bunch of crazy software they have

11:21.520 --> 11:26.360
to pre-install. It's not requiring a whole bunch of new packages on the ISO.

11:26.360 --> 11:27.920
Just some new good defaults.

11:27.920 --> 11:31.640
Yeah. And people will talk about, hey, if you want great battery life, use Fedora for

11:31.640 --> 11:33.600
at least a little while. So that'll be good for them too.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.400
You just said it right there. So now people are seeing it.

11:36.400 --> 11:41.900
It's being said. It's being said. There's some great news too for those of you that

11:41.900 --> 11:47.320
instead of installing Fedora 28 are going to be installing Ubuntu 18.04. But we're just

11:47.320 --> 11:52.240
talking about the future releases here, aren't we? On Ubuntu 18.04, it appears that you will

11:52.240 --> 11:58.280
now be able to switch snap package channels. I'm probably screwing that up a little bit,

11:58.280 --> 12:03.920
but my layman's understanding is one of the features of snap packages is that you can

12:03.920 --> 12:09.920
have like a beta channel and a release channel. And now the GNOME software app, or I think

12:09.920 --> 12:14.340
it's just called software, will let you choose which channel you want to subscribe to.

12:14.340 --> 12:18.080
I think I'm getting that all right. Winby, do you want to errata any of that?

12:18.080 --> 12:23.640
Yeah, yeah, you've got that about right. So by default, there are four channels. There's

12:23.640 --> 12:28.840
stable, which is self explanatory, candidate, which is where developers will put their release

12:28.840 --> 12:34.240
candidates, betas for betas and edge, which is typically what you'd hook up to your CI

12:34.240 --> 12:38.800
system. So after every commit or your daily or nightly builds, they would all land in

12:38.800 --> 12:44.840
edge so you can do your integration testing. And now what you can do in GNOME software

12:44.840 --> 12:52.440
in 1804 is when you look at the details for a snap in software center, it has a label

12:52.440 --> 12:57.540
there for the track or rather the channel that it's currently installed from, which

12:57.540 --> 13:03.800
by and large would be stable. And if you click on that, it will produce a list of the other

13:03.800 --> 13:09.460
channels that are available to you. So if you want to test the current beta or you want

13:09.460 --> 13:16.400
to get the latest crack from edge, then you can switch that and switch those channels.

13:16.400 --> 13:23.720
But what it also enables you to do is some of the people that are publishing in the store

13:23.720 --> 13:31.680
are using tracks, which are in addition to those channels. So for example, JetBrains

13:31.680 --> 13:37.960
have their early access program. So you can access the early access versions of all of

13:37.960 --> 13:46.360
their products through their EAP track. And likewise with Skype, you can access their

13:46.360 --> 13:51.800
insiders builds. So if you want to test out the really, really latest stuff, then you

13:51.800 --> 13:55.520
can also switch to those tracks through GNOME software as well now.

13:55.520 --> 14:01.400
That is really cool that JetBrains is doing that. The aspect that I like about it from

14:01.400 --> 14:07.240
an end user's perspective is it's tidier when I search for an app because instead of getting

14:07.240 --> 14:14.120
three or four entries for Slack or Mumble, it's just one entry. And then I can tack on

14:14.120 --> 14:17.280
which channel I want during installation.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.760
What level of risk you're prepared to take as a user.

14:20.760 --> 14:30.720
And so if I say do an edge release of something, that doesn't necessarily mean it's containerized

14:30.720 --> 14:35.920
or not, it's sandboxed or not. It could be an edge release and still be sandboxed.

14:35.920 --> 14:44.840
Correct. The edge is just the release. They're just labels. So it's whatever the developer

14:44.840 --> 14:48.160
feels comfortable inputting in those channels.

14:48.160 --> 14:53.280
What is the terminology for one that isn't sandboxed? Is it legacy or what's the term

14:53.280 --> 14:54.800
that when you're doing installs?

14:54.800 --> 15:01.480
There's classic, which is it's without any confinement. And then there is also dev mode,

15:01.480 --> 15:08.640
which you can't publish in the stable channel. And dev mode is kind of a reduced confinement

15:08.640 --> 15:14.280
model whilst you're iterating on your snap and scaffolding it together.

15:14.280 --> 15:18.520
Classic I think is what I was thinking of. And so now you don't even have to worry about

15:18.520 --> 15:22.880
what was the syntax or how do I add it to the install command. Now it'll just be exposed

15:22.880 --> 15:25.520
via the GUI for users installing software, which is great.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.120
Yeah, it makes it seem much more first class.

15:27.120 --> 15:30.280
Yeah, so that way when you know it's available like I just did, but I couldn't quite remember

15:30.280 --> 15:35.400
the syntax, that's perfect for that. That's where that kind of stuff is really nice. And

15:35.400 --> 15:40.000
is that, do you know an upstream thing Wimpy or is that unique to Ubuntu?

15:40.000 --> 15:44.640
It's part of the snap plugin for GNOME software.

15:44.640 --> 15:50.600
Ah, of course. So it's implemented at the plugin level. That is. That actually is. You

15:50.600 --> 15:56.400
got to say, GNOME software is actually keeping up. When it was thought up, we weren't talking

15:56.400 --> 16:01.400
about flat packs and snaps, were we? And in the past, I could have seen that having to

16:01.400 --> 16:05.880
be completely revamped. I'm not going to say it's my favorite way to install software or

16:05.880 --> 16:10.600
find software or even look at software, but I got to give them credit for the fact that

16:10.600 --> 16:15.200
they haven't had to throw out the entire thing to support flat packs and snaps.

16:15.200 --> 16:17.000
That's an open source win.

16:17.000 --> 16:23.200
Yay for plugins, I guess. All right, Wes. I know you're not a big XFCE user. Have you

16:23.200 --> 16:24.200
ever been an XFCE user?

16:24.200 --> 16:25.200
Oh yeah, back in the day.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.200
Oh, were you?

16:26.200 --> 16:29.120
Oh, well, that's nice. That's nice. I was, too.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.320
It's been probably five years now.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.640
Yeah, same. Yeah, I'd say it's been about five years. Yeah, I actually used it quite

16:33.640 --> 16:41.080
a bit for a while. It's a meme, in a way, in the Linux community about how long it takes

16:41.080 --> 16:49.520
for XFCE to ship. They've been working on 4.14, I think, for three years. The big part

16:49.520 --> 16:58.760
of 4.14 is the transition to GTK3. Don't think of XFCE as one monolithic thing, either. Think

16:58.760 --> 17:03.720
of it as a set of many different software components. You have Thunar for the file management.

17:03.720 --> 17:07.360
You have the window manager. You have the panels. You have the settings daemon. You

17:07.360 --> 17:13.680
have the power manager, the session initializer itself. Then, of course, you have the XF Desktop,

17:13.680 --> 17:17.200
which is the program that's responsible for managing desktop icons and backgrounds. There's

17:17.200 --> 17:23.240
lots of subcomponents. It goes on, actually. There's lots of other components. 4.14 has

17:23.240 --> 17:31.560
really been a process of porting everything to GTK3 Plus instead of GTK2 and using GDBus

17:31.560 --> 17:36.520
instead of DBus Lib and then using symbolic icons for all the panel plug-ins and removing

17:36.520 --> 17:42.360
depreciated widgets from code, old crap in the code. As they've moved along, they've

17:42.360 --> 17:49.320
made some good progress. They have ported many things to GTK3, including Thunar, the

17:49.320 --> 17:53.000
file manager, and the panel, and the power settings, and the settings manager itself,

17:53.000 --> 18:00.140
and the desktop session manager. But there is some low-hanging fruit that doesn't even

18:00.140 --> 18:06.400
have maintainers, like the calendar application, or the archive manager, or the CD burning

18:06.400 --> 18:12.960
application, or the volume control. So there's a few things that just, they're not even getting

18:12.960 --> 18:21.800
started yet. So that's a bit rough. There's 118 open bugs in XF Desktop, 119 in XFCE4

18:21.800 --> 18:29.200
Session, 206 in XFCE4 Settings, and it goes on. So they're behind here. And I think what

18:29.200 --> 18:36.160
my concern is, is you're dealing with 15 contributors, essentially, who are working on their free

18:36.160 --> 18:41.620
time to port these projects, to get them ready. And there's no real big corporate interest

18:41.620 --> 18:49.600
in XFCE. There's no Red Hat, or Canonical, or SUSE behind XFCE. And there's not any real

18:49.600 --> 18:53.560
big major distro that's even shipping it as its default desktop. So they're kind of

18:53.560 --> 19:00.800
let underdog here. It is just a passion project for these people. And there's no escaping

19:00.800 --> 19:06.880
the elephant in the room that is GTK4. I mean, like, it's getting close. By the time they

19:06.880 --> 19:13.480
get XFCE4.14 out, GTK4 could really be close to stable. And then they have to start again.

19:13.480 --> 19:16.480
I don't know if it's going to be the same amount of work. But that's to say nothing

19:16.480 --> 19:18.000
of Wayland support.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.680
Yeah, I mean, XFCE has a lot, there's a lot going on. It's not, you know, it has a lot

19:23.680 --> 19:28.320
of functionality as a desktop. It's not a bad desktop. I'm sure there's a sizable code

19:28.320 --> 19:30.920
based support.

19:30.920 --> 19:36.800
Yeah, it's hard for a project like that. It really is tough. And I know that we have folks

19:36.800 --> 19:40.620
in the audience that love it. You know, Joe from Linux Action News and Late Night Linux,

19:40.620 --> 19:44.640
it's his number one driver. And I've used it myself.

19:44.640 --> 19:49.440
I mean, the pace is concerning, but it's nice to at least see some details of the process

19:49.440 --> 19:53.200
that it is, it seems like they have at least semi structured way to go about doing it and

19:53.200 --> 19:55.000
to work does progress.

19:55.000 --> 20:02.640
Yeah, yeah. Anybody in the Mumba room an XFCE occasional user or a full time user? I'm betting

20:02.640 --> 20:03.640
no.

20:03.640 --> 20:10.400
Yeah, I don't I don't use the desktop per se. Yeah, but I do. I use XFCE for terminal.

20:10.400 --> 20:16.400
Yeah, it's great for that. Yeah, or like X2GO. But honestly, I think I think Wimpy has played

20:16.400 --> 20:22.080
a big role in making it irrelevant for me, because MATE has gotten so compelling and

20:22.080 --> 20:24.280
especially Ubuntu MATE over the last few years.

20:24.280 --> 20:28.400
And so where I used XFCE in the past, I now use MATE. So it's kind of your fault, Wimpy.

20:28.400 --> 20:33.800
Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the XFCE project for that. But I would like to point out that,

20:33.800 --> 20:43.200
you know, it took MATE an awfully long time to port from GTK 2 to GTK 3. The only reason

20:43.200 --> 20:52.200
it wasn't so obvious is we were maintaining a GTK 2 and GTK 3 code base in parallel during

20:52.200 --> 20:58.560
that transition, which to some extent probably delayed things. But for as long as I've been

20:58.560 --> 21:06.320
involved in MATE, which is getting on for six years now, we were doing that migration

21:06.320 --> 21:13.040
to GTK 3. And I think as a team, we're only satisfied that we've really kind of got there

21:13.040 --> 21:19.320
with the last release, which was last month, in terms of the GTK 3 stuff, in that now every

21:19.320 --> 21:26.800
if def rule in the code for special casing different versions of GTK have been removed

21:26.800 --> 21:35.120
because we're now just coalesced around GTK 3.2.2, which is the last stable release of

21:35.120 --> 21:36.120
GTK 3.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.120
You're right.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.120
You know what that said?

21:38.120 --> 21:39.120
Yeah, go on.

21:39.120 --> 21:42.480
Well, no, I wanted to finish.

21:42.480 --> 21:45.720
You said that, you know, the next thing is GTK 4.

21:45.720 --> 21:46.720
Yeah.

21:46.720 --> 21:55.280
There is no obligation to immediately start, you know, porting to GTK 4. GTK 3, everything's

21:55.280 --> 22:03.480
just landed on GTK 3, even things like Chrome, Firefox, LibreOffice, you know, those things

22:03.480 --> 22:10.040
have only just, you know, within the last, you know, months even, you know, LibreOffice

22:10.040 --> 22:16.840
a bit longer, but, you know, within months have started to properly take their hints

22:16.840 --> 22:17.840
from GTK 3.

22:17.840 --> 22:18.840
Right.

22:18.840 --> 22:20.200
So I think it's going to be some time and there's even, you know, the bigger projects

22:20.200 --> 22:24.100
like GIMP, you know, that have been around forever, they're still GTK 2.

22:24.100 --> 22:28.240
So they still, you know, catch up to be done, you know, all over the place.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.980
Yeah, that's a great point.

22:29.980 --> 22:37.280
That is a GTK 3 will be a stable target for, you know, desktops and application developers

22:37.280 --> 22:39.240
for some time to come.

22:39.240 --> 22:45.160
Even in the world of flat packs and snaps, does it perhaps matter a little bit less if,

22:45.160 --> 22:52.520
you know, you, if you've got an application in theory that needs GTK 3.22, you should

22:52.520 --> 22:56.880
be able to ship that for quite a while as a flat pack or a snap, even if my desktop

22:56.880 --> 22:58.840
is GTK 4 at that point.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.160
Yeah, absolutely.

23:00.160 --> 23:07.600
But I think you'll see GTK 3 and GTK 4 living alongside each other in distros in the future

23:07.600 --> 23:13.960
in the same way that we have GTK 2 and GTK 3 living along side each other, you know,

23:13.960 --> 23:15.640
and have done for many years now.

23:15.640 --> 23:16.800
That makes that makes a lot of sense.

23:16.800 --> 23:17.800
You know what?

23:17.800 --> 23:20.680
I so they're not talking about Wayland.

23:20.680 --> 23:24.240
But I don't see I don't see Monte talking a lot about Wayland.

23:24.240 --> 23:30.040
I've seen you make a few hints that, you know, in a recent 1804 post, I think you said don't

23:30.040 --> 23:32.440
don't get too excited by some of the Wayland work in there.

23:32.440 --> 23:36.280
It's not what you think I think was something similar to that wording.

23:36.280 --> 23:43.080
Yeah, we've been having well, the Wayland, the Wayland references that you may have seen

23:43.080 --> 23:50.760
in the change logs were actually to explicitly turn on x Wayland for some of the applications.

23:50.760 --> 23:57.080
So for people that were installing the Marte applications in a genome session, for example,

23:57.080 --> 24:03.320
which was, you know, Wayland by default on Fedora, and you know, on Ubuntu 1710, it meant

24:03.320 --> 24:07.800
that those applications would actually work.

24:07.800 --> 24:13.080
But they are is not a full, you know, Wayland implementation, it just enables x Wayland

24:13.080 --> 24:15.600
to step in and take over.

24:15.600 --> 24:23.840
But we have had our, our upstream conversations with the core Marte team, just this week about

24:23.840 --> 24:27.360
our road to Wayland.

24:27.360 --> 24:31.920
We've got some more discussions to have there, but we're starting to form a plan about how

24:31.920 --> 24:33.840
we're going to go about that.

24:33.840 --> 24:39.400
Is your sense that it is more work than the port to GTK 3?

24:39.400 --> 24:48.720
Yes, although we may get lucky in terms of how we can go about doing this, in that there

24:48.720 --> 24:54.520
may be some people who can can assist us some do some heavy lifting, as it were, yeah, yeah,

24:54.520 --> 24:55.520
yeah.

24:55.520 --> 25:00.160
So in the future, when when that's all fleshed out, I will, I will come back on and explain

25:00.160 --> 25:02.200
more about that one.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.800
I think that's gonna be extremely interesting to watch, because I think that could be useful

25:05.800 --> 25:07.440
for other projects as well.

25:07.440 --> 25:08.440
All right.

25:08.440 --> 25:09.440
Well, good stuff.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.440
All right.

25:10.440 --> 25:11.440
Well, don't go too far.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.760
I want to keep talking about Marte for just a moment.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.920
But I do want to take a break and think digital ocean.

25:14.920 --> 25:19.080
So standby while we mentioned that I did get I did get this in last week, this great deal

25:19.080 --> 25:21.360
we have digital ocean.com.

25:21.360 --> 25:24.120
You go to do dot co slash unplugged.

25:24.120 --> 25:28.160
That's the world I go to right now, because I am pretty sure that's the best way to get

25:28.160 --> 25:30.420
the special $100 credit offer.

25:30.420 --> 25:33.560
The digital ocean is offering the Jupiter broadcasting audience.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.240
It's a limited time offer.

25:35.240 --> 25:38.080
And I believe it lasts for 60 days once you apply it to your account.

25:38.080 --> 25:43.280
Now, this is incredible, because, honestly, in the past, the traditional and it's gonna

25:43.280 --> 25:49.440
what I'll go back to is the $10 credit, which is legitimately enough to get real work done

25:49.440 --> 25:52.200
for like two months on digital ocean.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.200
It's awesome.

25:53.200 --> 25:57.080
So the $100 credit blows my mind and build anything you want.

25:57.080 --> 26:00.760
Yeah, and I think this is what they're thinking, because it's true infrastructure on demand.

26:00.760 --> 26:04.700
Everything's SSDs, eight data centers all over the world, a killer dashboard to manage

26:04.700 --> 26:07.940
all of it, and then an API to automate it when you're ready to go or just grab some

26:07.940 --> 26:09.640
open source code that does it already.

26:09.640 --> 26:12.840
But here's where I think they're going with the $100 credit is they got a couple of new

26:12.840 --> 26:15.000
types of droplets that are killer.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.160
So they got a $15 a month one where you can mix and match the different resources, which

26:21.160 --> 26:23.840
depend on what you're doing, maybe you don't need just work out.

26:23.840 --> 26:27.880
Yeah, maybe you need more RAM, and you don't necessarily need a lot of local disk, or maybe

26:27.880 --> 26:32.560
you need a ton of CPU for something, and you just mix and match as you need it.

26:32.560 --> 26:36.160
And they also, there are standard droplets, which you can get for $5 a month starting

26:36.160 --> 26:37.280
there.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.680
They just got even more competitive.

26:38.680 --> 26:42.440
They have more everything, more everything, and if you have an existing one, you can upgrade

26:42.440 --> 26:43.440
it for free.

26:43.440 --> 26:44.800
They're crushing it.

26:44.800 --> 26:45.800
It's great.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.480
Digitalocean.com or do.co slash unplugged.

26:48.480 --> 26:52.820
I've been a customer for, I think, four years now, which blows my mind.

26:52.820 --> 26:57.360
We have large parts of the Jupyter Broadcasting infrastructure, which run on DigitalOcean

26:57.360 --> 27:04.240
24-7, and that means I am now down to one server on premise, which is just a large storage

27:04.240 --> 27:06.000
free NAS server now.

27:06.000 --> 27:10.040
When we first started at Jupyter Broadcasting, we brought in an i7 rig with lots of memory

27:10.040 --> 27:16.120
and lots of local disk and an NFS disk, and we ran a bunch of systems in a VM, Proxmox,

27:16.120 --> 27:20.080
I mean, I've told you guys about this all on the show.

27:20.080 --> 27:27.400
And over the years, it is so much simpler, so much faster, and honestly, long term, it's

27:27.400 --> 27:31.360
costing me way less to run on DigitalOcean than having to spend thousands and thousands

27:31.360 --> 27:33.240
of dollars on local infrastructure.

27:33.240 --> 27:36.800
And the nice thing is we can build for what we need today and then easily expand it.

27:36.800 --> 27:37.800
I've said enough.

27:37.800 --> 27:44.320
Really, all you need to know is do.co slash unplugged, $100 credit if you're a new customer.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.200
Hot off the presses right there, Wes.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.200
Limited time offer.

27:47.200 --> 27:51.480
Take advantage of it because I was negligent in telling you about it soon enough.

27:51.480 --> 27:55.640
Also, if you want to get yourself some web mail set up, I'm a fan of the Roundcube.

27:55.640 --> 28:00.640
That's one of my more, I think it's like, I don't know what else you could compare it

28:00.640 --> 28:01.640
to, actually.

28:01.640 --> 28:07.000
It's the closest to something like a Gmail or like a commercial web mail client that

28:07.000 --> 28:08.520
you can run and host yourself.

28:08.520 --> 28:14.280
Roundcube, it just connects to your mail server over IMAP and SMTP, so you don't even necessarily

28:14.280 --> 28:15.620
have to host your own mail server.

28:15.620 --> 28:18.840
You could connect it to just another IMAP server that you have or that you may be already

28:18.840 --> 28:19.840
using.

28:19.840 --> 28:23.880
Roundcube, they have a tutorial on DigitalOcean for how to set it up.

28:23.880 --> 28:25.600
I don't actually know.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.800
Don't tell them I said this, but I don't think there's anything necessarily too DigitalOcean

28:28.800 --> 28:32.920
specific maybe than just the very beginning of installing the computer.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.960
But the rest would work if you just had your own system.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.280
Yeah, it's just great documentation.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.280
Yeah.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.240
Or go spin up a VPS over on DigitalOcean.

28:39.240 --> 28:40.620
They call them droplets.

28:40.620 --> 28:43.260
Put up Roundcube and then point it to an IMAP server that you've been using.

28:43.260 --> 28:46.680
And now you just got yourself a web mail that you're hosting that somebody else isn't slurping

28:46.680 --> 28:47.680
down.

28:47.680 --> 28:48.680
That's pretty great.

28:48.680 --> 28:49.680
do.co.

28:49.680 --> 28:50.680
slash unplugged.

28:50.680 --> 28:51.680
All right.

28:51.680 --> 28:56.800
So, Wimpy, I was talking before the show with you, and you started describing the minimal

28:56.800 --> 29:01.280
installer work that you're doing for Ubuntu MATE, and I thought, okay, yeah, that sounds

29:01.280 --> 29:02.280
decent.

29:02.280 --> 29:06.920
But the more you talked about it, I started thinking, geez, this might be the most popular

29:06.920 --> 29:07.920
implementation.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.040
This is sounding really, really good.

29:09.040 --> 29:14.220
So let's back up a little bit and maybe just a super quick refresher on what the minimal

29:14.220 --> 29:15.220
install is.

29:15.220 --> 29:18.040
And I guess maybe some of the work you had to do to get it into Ubuntu MATE, because

29:18.040 --> 29:21.560
I guess you don't just inherit that, you have to make some choices and implement some decisions.

29:21.560 --> 29:22.560
Yeah.

29:22.560 --> 29:23.560
Tell me a little bit about it.

29:23.560 --> 29:30.880
So this is piggybacking on the work of my colleagues, Didrox and Lainey, who have landed

29:30.880 --> 29:36.480
the minimal install capability in the Ubiquity installer.

29:36.480 --> 29:42.680
So I just happened to be poking around in the Ubiquity code on an unrelated matter yesterday

29:42.680 --> 29:47.640
evening, and I noticed that this feature had landed.

29:47.640 --> 29:52.840
So I contacted Lainey and said, so how do I turn this on for Ubuntu MATE?

29:52.840 --> 29:54.040
And he said, oh, it's easy.

29:54.040 --> 29:58.340
You just create this file and you put the things in it that you want to be removed from

29:58.340 --> 30:00.200
your install.

30:00.200 --> 30:07.420
So I did that work for Ubuntu MATE last night, and then the nightly images ran.

30:07.420 --> 30:10.920
So it's built for the flavors to use as well.

30:10.920 --> 30:12.960
It was purpose built for that.

30:12.960 --> 30:15.240
It's not just unique to just upstream Ubuntu.

30:15.240 --> 30:18.300
No, any of the flavors can take advantage of it.

30:18.300 --> 30:24.520
So I'll just go into some text because I know some of the flavor maintainers listen to the

30:24.520 --> 30:25.920
podcast.

30:25.920 --> 30:36.640
So what you do is you modify your seeds and the seeds are where you list what your distribution

30:36.640 --> 30:37.640
is comprised of.

30:37.640 --> 30:42.980
So the applications that are in the core image, in the base image.

30:42.980 --> 30:49.280
And you add a new file in there and it's simply called desktop.minimal-remove.

30:49.280 --> 30:56.840
And in that file, you basically list all of the packages that you want to be removed from

30:56.840 --> 30:59.020
the default install.

30:59.020 --> 31:07.160
And if that file exists, when Ubiquity runs, it will now present a new option in the installer.

31:07.160 --> 31:11.040
So in the install screens, if you've installed Ubuntu before, you will have seen a screen

31:11.040 --> 31:17.140
where it asks you if you want to install updates while it's installing, and if you want to

31:17.140 --> 31:21.960
install additional codecs on that screen, you'll see a new option, which is do you want

31:21.960 --> 31:23.600
the minimal install?

31:23.600 --> 31:28.720
And it describes the minimal install as the desktop and utilities and browser only.

31:28.720 --> 31:29.720
Oh yeah.

31:29.720 --> 31:35.520
I mean, now when you're combining lightweight Mote with a minimal install, so it's just

31:35.520 --> 31:42.320
Firefox, basic desktop tools, core utilities, no VLC, no Thunderbird, no calculator?

31:42.320 --> 31:50.960
Well, the calculator is part of the core Mote desktop, so you get the file manager and the

31:50.960 --> 31:57.640
text editor and the document viewer and the image viewer, but you don't get LibreOffice,

31:57.640 --> 32:04.600
you don't get Thunderbird, you don't get VLC, you don't get Rhythmbox, all of that extra

32:04.600 --> 32:06.400
stuff, you don't get transmission.

32:06.400 --> 32:13.240
So everything additional to the core desktop is effectively removed.

32:13.240 --> 32:16.960
So you get a very trim, simple system.

32:16.960 --> 32:22.200
And I was thinking to myself, who would use this and why would you use it?

32:22.200 --> 32:29.520
And I've heard a few people say, oh, well, I like to curate my own desktop experience.

32:29.520 --> 32:34.040
I know what applications I want, so they would want that.

32:34.040 --> 32:37.160
But I was thinking to myself, how would I use it?

32:37.160 --> 32:42.120
And I was thinking, well, I've got one machine that I use specifically for gaming now, and

32:42.120 --> 32:45.720
I would choose the minimal option on that machine.

32:45.720 --> 32:51.360
So I just get the base stuff and then I can slap Steam on top of that, and I've just got

32:51.360 --> 32:58.720
a real trim machine for running Steam or you could create your own Kodi boxes in a similar

32:58.720 --> 32:59.720
way as well.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.120
Yeah, I do like that.

33:01.120 --> 33:08.320
I was just thinking, too, you could absolutely see it as a workstation OS, where maybe you

33:08.320 --> 33:13.200
go to work and you install Slack and you have to install Chrome and maybe even Skype and

33:13.200 --> 33:19.280
all of these things that just are kind of, I don't know, they're just applications now

33:19.280 --> 33:21.200
that you can snap install or go get the...

33:21.200 --> 33:22.840
Have a real minimal base.

33:22.840 --> 33:23.840
Or you can get the devs.

33:23.840 --> 33:24.840
Yeah.

33:24.840 --> 33:29.420
The software boutique actually makes some of that easier on MATE, but yeah, I really

33:29.420 --> 33:34.000
like that because I'm generally going to Ubuntu MATE for a minimal lean, lean, mean fighting

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
machine.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.000
Yeah.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.640
But what it retains is all of the underlying hardware support.

33:39.640 --> 33:45.040
So anything you need for your network devices to function, that's all still included.

33:45.040 --> 33:49.160
Anything you need for Bluetooth and audio, that's all still included.

33:49.160 --> 33:56.640
So it's just that layer of applications on the top, but it's down to each flavor maintainer

33:56.640 --> 33:59.140
to choose what they want to remove.

33:59.140 --> 34:02.240
So there's no prescribed list.

34:02.240 --> 34:08.640
The list in Ubuntu MATE is different than the list in Ubuntu, for example.

34:08.640 --> 34:16.200
And so the question that's coming up, before we go too far off that, is how is this different

34:16.200 --> 34:21.640
than an install script that just is like a different set of packages to install?

34:21.640 --> 34:24.240
How is this different than an install script is essentially what the chat room is asking

34:24.240 --> 34:25.880
in IRC.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.900
How it's different from an install, where it's the opposite of an install script.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.760
It's an uninstall script, essentially.

34:30.760 --> 34:31.760
I like that.

34:31.760 --> 34:32.760
Yeah.

34:32.760 --> 34:34.720
Because it's an image that's getting deployed to the hard drive, right?

34:34.720 --> 34:37.080
It's getting based on the live environment.

34:37.080 --> 34:38.080
Yeah.

34:38.080 --> 34:42.640
So the image that's on the ISO, there is a squashFS file system, and that is effectively

34:42.640 --> 34:44.800
put on your hard disk.

34:44.800 --> 34:50.240
And then at the end of that process, there are already some packages that get removed.

34:50.240 --> 34:51.960
The installer itself, for example.

34:51.960 --> 34:59.520
So Ubiquity, the installer, removes itself as part of the cleanup of the installation.

34:59.520 --> 35:06.920
So what this minimal install does is it tags itself on to that piece of the code that's

35:06.920 --> 35:12.680
already there to build out a bigger list of what should be removed.

35:12.680 --> 35:18.420
And then it rattles through that list and removes anything that the maintainer has identified

35:18.420 --> 35:22.160
as, this is stuff you don't need in a minimal install.

35:22.160 --> 35:23.160
Okay.

35:23.160 --> 35:24.160
Interesting.

35:24.160 --> 35:25.160
That makes sense.

35:25.160 --> 35:26.760
So it's the opposite of an install script.

35:26.760 --> 35:29.060
And this will be landing in 1804.

35:29.060 --> 35:31.120
It's already essentially the work's done, right?

35:31.120 --> 35:33.440
It landed in the daily images yesterday.

35:33.440 --> 35:34.440
Oh!

35:34.440 --> 35:35.440
Yeah.

35:35.440 --> 35:36.440
Fantastic.

35:36.440 --> 35:41.400
It's just down to each of the flavors now to create their minimal remove file in their

35:41.400 --> 35:43.040
seeds.

35:43.040 --> 35:47.320
And then they can take advantage of that function as well.

35:47.320 --> 35:49.400
That's really great.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.840
It's funny that we're just getting to it now, don't you think?

35:51.840 --> 35:52.840
In a way?

35:52.840 --> 35:55.660
Like, why haven't we had this for years?

35:55.660 --> 36:01.800
It's interesting because before I worked at Canonical, I did some work with the Xubuntu

36:01.800 --> 36:06.360
team, where we were trying to achieve precisely this.

36:06.360 --> 36:12.600
Because we wanted minimal installations, and in fact, Xubuntu make their own set of, I

36:12.600 --> 36:18.160
think they call them core images available, and have done for a couple of years now, where

36:18.160 --> 36:22.600
they effectively have an ISO, which is the minimal ISO.

36:22.600 --> 36:28.640
So it's, you know, what I've just described, but already packed in an ISO.

36:28.640 --> 36:32.920
And we did some work to try and land that in a way that everyone could have two ISOs.

36:32.920 --> 36:38.480
So you can have an Ubuntu Mate, I think we called them base, an Ubuntu Mate base ISO,

36:38.480 --> 36:41.760
and the full fat ISO.

36:41.760 --> 36:47.160
But for reasons people were busy, that never got any traction.

36:47.160 --> 36:50.820
And now, you know, now we have this, which is, I think, quite an elegant solution because

36:50.820 --> 36:55.160
now there's still one ISO to download, but you can use it in two ways.

36:55.160 --> 36:58.600
So did this ball get rolling from what you probably understand, because I know it's not

36:58.600 --> 37:01.240
directly work that you were involved in?

37:01.240 --> 37:04.440
Did Rock's probably better to ask, but did this get started based on some of the feedback

37:04.440 --> 37:07.440
that people, like people, I like Chrome, or I prefer MPV.

37:07.440 --> 37:10.760
And so is this sort of a middle ground?

37:10.760 --> 37:14.240
I think you're well connected with did Rock's, and you should ask him that question, because

37:14.240 --> 37:17.600
I don't know the origin story of how this came to be.

37:17.600 --> 37:20.480
Because it is funny that it's just showing up now in 1804.

37:20.480 --> 37:23.040
I mean, I'm thankful for it.

37:23.040 --> 37:27.800
But I think this, to a degree, is probably why some people have chosen other distributions.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.480
I'm sure not by a very large percentage.

37:29.480 --> 37:32.880
But I bet there's people in our audience that have decided to go a different route just

37:32.880 --> 37:33.880
because of the package selection.

37:33.880 --> 37:37.360
I mean, that was what drove people to Ubuntu, too, at the same time.

37:37.360 --> 37:38.360
Yeah.

37:38.360 --> 37:39.680
And you've got both options now.

37:39.680 --> 37:46.040
You know, those people that like a very specific desktop experience can do that.

37:46.040 --> 37:50.040
You know, for some people, all you actually need is the minimal install, because you can

37:50.040 --> 37:51.460
do everything in a browser.

37:51.460 --> 37:55.560
You've basically created a Chromebook at that point.

37:55.560 --> 38:00.400
And now you can install containers, or applications in containers, and that's all cyclical, or

38:00.400 --> 38:02.440
whatever it is, circular, what is it?

38:02.440 --> 38:04.120
What am I looking for, Wes?

38:04.120 --> 38:05.120
Cyclical!

38:05.120 --> 38:06.960
Cyclical, that's what it is, cyclical.

38:06.960 --> 38:07.960
You got there yourself.

38:07.960 --> 38:09.800
Well, Wimpy, thank you for telling us all about that.

38:09.800 --> 38:11.000
You know me, I just love hearing about that.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.160
I hope other people do, too, because even if you're not an Ubuntu Monte user, I think

38:14.160 --> 38:15.160
this stuff is fascinating.

38:15.160 --> 38:19.160
Because right here, I'm sitting on a Plasma Neon desktop, but yet, this, I love hearing

38:19.160 --> 38:20.160
about.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.080
I love the thought behind it and all of it, so I really always appreciate when you come

38:22.080 --> 38:23.080
out here and tell us all that stuff.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.080
You're welcome.

38:24.080 --> 38:28.280
I don't know if anybody out there has had a chance to try Cadian Live recently.

38:28.280 --> 38:30.960
A lot of people ask about video editing still.

38:30.960 --> 38:34.400
We get a lot of questions, and I just sort of, I kind of punt, and I punt, and I punt.

38:34.400 --> 38:37.120
But it's getting legitimate with Cadian Live.

38:37.120 --> 38:41.040
I'd like to know if people who are doing actual serious amounts of video editing under Linux,

38:41.040 --> 38:45.680
like, you know, like Ven Stone, who edits, you know, I think he's doing two shows a week

38:45.680 --> 38:51.160
under Linux, but I think he uses OpenShot, like an old version of OpenShot, because he's

38:51.160 --> 38:52.160
a madman, Ven.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.160
You're a madman.

38:53.160 --> 38:54.160
That's crazy.

38:54.160 --> 38:55.160
You're a madman.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.040
So I don't know if, I'd like to know if somebody like Ven, or there's probably not as many

38:57.040 --> 39:00.200
people that do as much editing as he does, but on a regular basis, they're putting out

39:00.200 --> 39:04.480
complex, long content on Linux.

39:04.480 --> 39:09.600
Have you tried the new Cadian Live, because this, to me, is hitting a lot of what draws

39:09.600 --> 39:14.840
me to Final Cut, and this is getting, I don't know, maybe it's also the fact, probably is

39:14.840 --> 39:19.080
a bit of the fact that I've been on a plasma kick recently, too, and this is a cute application,

39:19.080 --> 39:20.600
so it also looks really great on my desktop.

39:20.600 --> 39:26.120
But I downloaded the app image, yes, it's an app image, so you can, it's kind of a convoluted

39:26.120 --> 39:27.120
process.

39:27.120 --> 39:31.720
I will link to the fastest way for you to get the app image, because they don't just

39:31.720 --> 39:33.160
link to it directly.

39:33.160 --> 39:39.220
They make you attend this cafe session, and you can find a link to a text file that has

39:39.220 --> 39:42.880
a list of the mirrors, which will then land you on this page that I have found.

39:42.880 --> 39:46.040
So I will link this to you if you want to try it and give me feedback, because I'm going

39:46.040 --> 39:49.680
to experiment a little bit with it, but I'm honestly just not doing as much video as I

39:49.680 --> 39:52.340
was in the past, so I'm not the best candidate.

39:52.340 --> 39:55.040
But it looks like a super great release.

39:55.040 --> 39:57.880
One of the things that I really like about Cadian Live is they have this really steady

39:57.880 --> 40:05.320
approach, and they've been like on this, we do, like, so for example, 17.12 series has

40:05.320 --> 40:12.680
just been constant, solid, fix this little thing, solve this bug, come up with a solution

40:12.680 --> 40:15.800
for that, minor bug fix stuff.

40:15.800 --> 40:18.720
And so you can just say, well, I'm on this branch, that's what I get, and I really like

40:18.720 --> 40:20.140
that about that, too.

40:20.140 --> 40:25.760
So 18.04 is the next version, which I don't think is necessarily synced up to any Ubuntu

40:25.760 --> 40:28.720
server, but it's sort of that same versioning system.

40:28.720 --> 40:31.480
And they are working out the rough edges right now.

40:31.480 --> 40:35.040
They've published it as a app image, which I'll link to.

40:35.040 --> 40:39.480
And if you're out there and want to give them some feedback, if I was going to bet on a

40:39.480 --> 40:45.280
horse right now for getting really good approachable video editing on desktop Linux, as much as

40:45.280 --> 40:49.920
I respect Jonathan and all of the hard, continuing work he's doing into OpenShot over the years,

40:49.920 --> 40:56.440
the horse I would bet on right now is KDE and Live, not Lightworks, not all of the other

40:56.440 --> 40:57.440
ones that we send in.

40:57.440 --> 40:58.440
It's looking really nice.

40:58.440 --> 40:59.440
It's KDE and Live.

40:59.440 --> 41:00.440
Yeah, there's a lot of different ones.

41:00.440 --> 41:03.400
There's, like, a clip editor one, you know, but it's just, yeah.

41:03.400 --> 41:10.160
So anyways, if you want to help what I think is potentially our best hope for good video

41:10.160 --> 41:11.160
editing.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.160
And we need one.

41:12.160 --> 41:15.600
Yeah, I just, it's called, the link in the show notes will be called KDE Experience Freedom

41:15.600 --> 41:21.000
with an exclamation mark, KDE dash Experience Freedom with an exclamation mark.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.680
That's the link to look for because that's the typical kind of communication you get

41:24.680 --> 41:25.800
from the KDE group out there.

41:25.800 --> 41:31.680
They just, they're not so good with the way they phrase things or the, that kind of, I

41:31.680 --> 41:32.680
love them.

41:32.680 --> 41:34.160
It's like you haven't invested in freedom enough over there.

41:34.160 --> 41:35.160
I know.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.160
I know.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.980
I need to invest in, I need to invest in freedom as their website tells me, and I need to experience

41:39.980 --> 41:42.240
freedom with an exclamation mark.

41:42.240 --> 41:43.320
I'm feeling pretty free right now.

41:43.320 --> 41:44.640
I do appreciate that about it.

41:44.640 --> 41:45.800
I do appreciate that.

41:45.800 --> 41:48.640
That may be the new air freshener, but I don't think so.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.580
I'm feeling pretty, pretty free.

41:50.580 --> 41:53.320
So we'll have that linked in the show notes if you want to check that out.

41:53.320 --> 41:55.920
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

41:55.920 --> 42:02.360
That's where to go to support the show and sign up for a free seven day trial, free seven

42:02.360 --> 42:03.360
day trial.

42:03.360 --> 42:04.920
What's better than free?

42:04.920 --> 42:06.340
Freedom.

42:06.340 --> 42:08.240
And maybe sometimes like a cold drink on a really.

42:08.240 --> 42:09.400
Oh, that's way better.

42:09.400 --> 42:10.720
It's really good.

42:10.720 --> 42:13.640
But free, like that, if that drink was free, it's even better.

42:13.640 --> 42:14.640
You see what I'm saying?

42:14.640 --> 42:15.920
Like it can't get better.

42:15.920 --> 42:18.840
So seven day free trial Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

42:18.840 --> 42:23.820
It's a platform to learn about Linux and all of this stuff around Linux.

42:23.820 --> 42:25.840
And now the kind of stuff that gets you hired.

42:25.840 --> 42:26.840
That's a really good.

42:26.840 --> 42:28.320
That's another really nice thing about Linux Academy.

42:28.320 --> 42:31.680
I would use this for ongoing training as well as getting hired.

42:31.680 --> 42:35.120
Think of it as whatever you need to get done if you need to learn more about a nitty gritty

42:35.120 --> 42:39.800
thing around Linux or if you need to learn about AWS and OpenStack and Azure and all

42:39.800 --> 42:41.080
of these things.

42:41.080 --> 42:43.960
This is also perhaps the best solution for you.

42:43.960 --> 42:49.200
They have some really, really great and they're frequently adding new content to the AWS stuff.

42:49.200 --> 42:52.440
I'm really impressed with like their maniacs over there with the content and the way they

42:52.440 --> 42:57.120
get that is they hire full time instructors, people that are really familiar with this

42:57.120 --> 43:01.600
stuff and they just sit there and they churn out this stuff in a way that I don't know.

43:01.600 --> 43:06.000
They got the system like they build a process where they come up with something that's really

43:06.000 --> 43:09.800
applicable to people, that's really going to add value for something to learn about.

43:09.800 --> 43:11.600
Then they build out the best way to do it.

43:11.600 --> 43:15.480
They build into the system where you can choose the distribution you want to learn from.

43:15.480 --> 43:18.640
They keep testing it out at each point then they start testing it more to get like kind

43:18.640 --> 43:22.080
of feedback and they've reached out to me a few times on this to see if like I want

43:22.080 --> 43:25.980
to try out a new system and then they roll it out and iterate on it in a way that keeps

43:25.980 --> 43:30.760
your subscription valuable and then they add new content and they go back and they keep

43:30.760 --> 43:33.800
the old stuff fresh and then they're ready to help you whenever you get stuck because

43:33.800 --> 43:36.100
those instructors are full time.

43:36.100 --> 43:40.560
Like this is a machine now and it's just been getting them a ton of industry credibility

43:40.560 --> 43:45.040
and you can get hands on scenario based labs, a course scheduler for when you're busy and

43:45.040 --> 43:49.560
they have all kinds of content that really is great for when you're like just want to

43:49.560 --> 43:54.520
hone in on one single thing or you're ready to take on a whole certification course.

43:54.520 --> 43:57.880
And so that means when you've got a really busy life or when you've got time to take

43:57.880 --> 44:01.000
your career to the next level, they've got content to serve you.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.420
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

44:03.420 --> 44:07.640
Go there, sign up for a free seven day trial and a big thank you to Linux Academy.

44:07.640 --> 44:08.640
Seven day trial free.

44:08.640 --> 44:10.440
So great I hit my mic because my hands are dancing around.

44:10.440 --> 44:11.440
You're so excited.

44:11.440 --> 44:12.440
I really was.

44:12.440 --> 44:16.200
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

44:16.200 --> 44:20.640
All right you crazy sons of bitches, I can't be dragged around like this anymore.

44:20.640 --> 44:23.920
Oh we're going to talk about this.

44:23.920 --> 44:27.040
So I asked this really stupid question last week, well actually it started when I asked

44:27.040 --> 44:29.640
the question would you like to switch to Discord and everybody said yes.

44:29.640 --> 44:34.040
And now here we are, what, three, four months into this thing?

44:34.040 --> 44:35.040
Maybe a little more than that?

44:35.040 --> 44:36.040
Six months?

44:36.040 --> 44:37.040
I don't know.

44:37.040 --> 44:38.040
I don't know.

44:38.040 --> 44:39.040
It feels like ages.

44:39.040 --> 44:40.040
It feels like it's been 25 years.

44:40.040 --> 44:42.480
And I actually don't mind Discord.

44:42.480 --> 44:46.920
I've been hanging out in other communities and you know what I like is the communities

44:46.920 --> 44:48.480
that don't have to waffle like this.

44:48.480 --> 44:49.480
That's what I like.

44:49.480 --> 44:53.280
It's just you don't waffle, you don't move it, you just invest and you build.

44:53.280 --> 44:57.600
And every time I feel like we change direction, you spill off some people, you also gain new

44:57.600 --> 44:58.600
people.

44:58.600 --> 45:00.040
So it's got its pros and its cons.

45:00.040 --> 45:06.600
But we went out to a vote and we said should we switch from Discord back to IRC or just

45:06.600 --> 45:09.820
hang tight, stick it out with Discord for the long haul.

45:09.820 --> 45:16.120
And each has its pros and cons, IRC's, well it's like plumbing at this point.

45:16.120 --> 45:21.360
It's pretty universal and it's a classic.

45:21.360 --> 45:24.940
It's just like amongst our community, it's got a bit of a barrier of entry to people

45:24.940 --> 45:29.440
outside the open source community but it's a staple in the open source community.

45:29.440 --> 45:32.180
Now Discord has the advantage of a network effect.

45:32.180 --> 45:37.960
It also has a bunch of other fancy features that are more modern like they just have their

45:37.960 --> 45:43.640
own mobile client and they support emojis and embedded imagery and Twitter previews

45:43.640 --> 45:44.640
and all this stuff.

45:44.640 --> 45:45.640
All the fanciness.

45:45.640 --> 45:46.640
Yeah.

45:46.640 --> 45:51.820
That if you were to say drop down on the planet today in 2018 and try to join a community,

45:51.820 --> 45:55.960
you would just kind of expect that they might just be able to do this.

45:55.960 --> 45:59.300
They might just have this.

45:59.300 --> 46:01.560
So I wasn't really sure what to do.

46:01.560 --> 46:05.920
We were thinking behind the scenes, dramatically, that it would be easier for some of the things

46:05.920 --> 46:10.480
we want to automate if it was IRC because we're still trying to come up with this perfect

46:10.480 --> 46:15.140
cloud OBS setup where we would ingest an IRC stream and automatically generate a video

46:15.140 --> 46:18.580
and send that out on the video stream and all of that.

46:18.580 --> 46:21.320
But it just doesn't seem like that would be super easy to do with Discord.

46:21.320 --> 46:24.100
It would be pretty easy to do with IRC.

46:24.100 --> 46:33.880
So the vote went out and it was pretty clear IRC by a 79% vote and Discord had a 21% vote.

46:33.880 --> 46:39.660
We're not talking hundreds of numbers here, but that's a, you know, usually that's how

46:39.660 --> 46:40.660
it sticks.

46:40.660 --> 46:44.800
Those are usually pretty indicative, representative I believe would be the term.

46:44.800 --> 46:48.360
So that's a 79% win, right?

46:48.360 --> 46:49.360
That's huge.

46:49.360 --> 46:52.720
That's a big margin of win for IRC.

46:52.720 --> 46:53.720
That's big.

46:53.720 --> 46:55.400
People have spoken, I suppose.

46:55.400 --> 46:59.480
The thing is, is we go back to IRC, we go back and we just...

46:59.480 --> 47:01.200
Right, like does Discord just die?

47:01.200 --> 47:02.200
Is it left to wither?

47:02.200 --> 47:03.200
What?

47:03.200 --> 47:04.840
Well, I don't think you got to shut it down.

47:04.840 --> 47:10.500
I mean, the main thing I'm thinking about is like, if you want to, it's like the primary

47:10.500 --> 47:11.500
chat room.

47:11.500 --> 47:13.720
So it's what's on the live stream.

47:13.720 --> 47:18.240
It's where people idle the most or they're having an active conversation.

47:18.240 --> 47:19.240
I don't know.

47:19.240 --> 47:20.240
I don't know.

47:20.240 --> 47:21.240
I don't have answers to that.

47:21.240 --> 47:23.880
I don't like any of this, but I want to do what the audience likes in this regard because

47:23.880 --> 47:26.000
it's a tool for them.

47:26.000 --> 47:33.640
So Virtual Lug, you guys get first say since you're here, you're in the voice chat.

47:33.640 --> 47:34.640
You get first say.

47:34.640 --> 47:38.400
Does anybody have a strong opinion on this one way or the other?

47:38.400 --> 47:42.520
I'd love to hear some input on this because I'm really, I just want to use whatever people

47:42.520 --> 47:43.520
like.

47:43.520 --> 47:56.080
Yeah, well, well, to me, I would see the Discord is like the, I would say the Reddit chat versus

47:56.080 --> 47:58.240
the RC being the live stream.

47:58.240 --> 48:02.640
And also, since there are very few, since there are very few people who go to the live

48:02.640 --> 48:08.080
stream to participate, I mean, there are more people that are coming in a day, we got months

48:08.080 --> 48:11.280
and years to come, such as myself that came in recently.

48:11.280 --> 48:16.520
But it's, I would say IRC would fill that niche pretty well with the live stream.

48:16.520 --> 48:20.960
And plus, there are some clients that do support some of the newer features that you mentioned,

48:20.960 --> 48:21.960
so.

48:21.960 --> 48:22.960
Hmm.

48:22.960 --> 48:23.960
Yeah.

48:23.960 --> 48:24.960
All right.

48:24.960 --> 48:27.480
Well, I'm going to leave the vote up for a little bit longer while I think about it.

48:27.480 --> 48:29.880
I'm not in a huge rush to do anything, and I got to go to scale.

48:29.880 --> 48:30.880
But it's on my mind.

48:30.880 --> 48:32.360
I want to do what people like.

48:32.360 --> 48:35.840
So and you know, meanwhile, the Telegram group's going solid.

48:35.840 --> 48:36.840
So yeah.

48:36.840 --> 48:37.840
They're up in their own universe.

48:37.840 --> 48:39.000
That is good, really.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.000
That's kind of a nice thing.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.800
That's just like, well, we don't care.

48:41.800 --> 48:42.800
Yeah.

48:42.800 --> 48:47.960
If you want to get on that, jupyterbroadcasting.com slash telegram to join our telegram group.

48:47.960 --> 48:50.200
There's my quarterly plug for that.

48:50.200 --> 48:51.200
All right, Wes.

48:51.200 --> 48:52.200
Well, that's not actually what we're.

48:52.200 --> 48:53.200
No, it's not.

48:53.200 --> 48:55.000
I guess that's on my mind.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.000
Like I said, this is a meandering episode.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.960
I think it's on everyone's mind.

48:57.960 --> 48:59.800
Let's talk about Crankshaft.

48:59.800 --> 49:01.880
This is pretty, pretty great.

49:01.880 --> 49:04.120
Now I'm going to, I'll play a little bit of the demo for you.

49:04.120 --> 49:07.040
Just I'm going to do a couple of bits of it because it's a little rough.

49:07.040 --> 49:08.400
But just to give you an idea of what it's like.

49:08.400 --> 49:10.440
So you download this image.

49:10.440 --> 49:12.200
You write it to the SD card.

49:12.200 --> 49:14.040
You toss it in your Raspberry Pi.

49:14.040 --> 49:16.400
You hook up the $60 touch screen.

49:16.400 --> 49:24.280
And okay, so in this video, I just want to talk real quick about the capability of open

49:24.280 --> 49:33.320
auto and how it's working in the alpha version of Crankshaft right now.

49:33.320 --> 49:34.320
And let's start.

49:34.320 --> 49:38.480
This is just a Raspberry Pi 3B.

49:38.480 --> 49:42.080
And so he goes through and demos the functionality of this thing in it.

49:42.080 --> 49:47.560
Once he gets it up and running, it just looks like Android auto completely with your playback

49:47.560 --> 49:50.600
controls, your Google Now cards.

49:50.600 --> 49:54.000
It's communicating with his Android device.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.120
He just makes a phone call through it.

49:56.120 --> 49:58.180
He can see the battery life of his phone.

49:58.180 --> 49:59.680
He can use navigation.

49:59.680 --> 50:01.300
That looks pretty handy.

50:01.300 --> 50:06.320
But actually, there he's using Pocket Cast to listen to Radiolab.

50:06.320 --> 50:07.880
I kind of want to do this in my truck.

50:07.880 --> 50:09.560
You know what I'm talking about because my screen's all screwed up.

50:09.560 --> 50:10.560
Yeah.

50:10.560 --> 50:11.560
I mean, you're a perfect candidate for it.

50:11.560 --> 50:12.560
I know.

50:12.560 --> 50:13.560
I know.

50:13.560 --> 50:15.760
If somebody has any experience with this, you got to let me know because I'm tempted

50:15.760 --> 50:16.760
to do this.

50:16.760 --> 50:17.760
We just need the touch screen.

50:17.760 --> 50:18.760
I need the screen.

50:18.760 --> 50:19.760
Yeah.

50:19.760 --> 50:20.760
I need to pick up the screen.

50:20.760 --> 50:24.840
And then you'd have to figure out a way to install the dash, which is not my strength,

50:24.840 --> 50:25.840
I got to say.

50:25.840 --> 50:26.920
But it's called Crankshaft.

50:26.920 --> 50:29.380
And that was a developer there who you heard in the video.

50:29.380 --> 50:32.240
It's just a project just by him.

50:32.240 --> 50:33.880
It's just his thing.

50:33.880 --> 50:36.920
And it's admittedly alpha.

50:36.920 --> 50:39.440
But come on, it's going to be pretty cool.

50:39.440 --> 50:45.800
I think Android Auto is fairly baked and it's using, I think, Raspbian for the distribution.

50:45.800 --> 50:49.840
And there's a pretty active amount of people on the GitHub talking about it.

50:49.840 --> 50:53.840
It's nice to be able to play in that space at all and maybe even have a system that actually

50:53.840 --> 50:55.480
works and could be useful.

50:55.480 --> 50:59.560
Yeah, and the main thing that I wanted to avoid with something like this was, and I

50:59.560 --> 51:03.680
was thinking like a Carputer, I've been thinking about that for a couple of months.

51:03.680 --> 51:08.960
I haven't really, really, the only reason I didn't go with a Carputer is in the couple

51:08.960 --> 51:14.160
of months that I've been sort of debating what to do, I have found that I am perfectly

51:14.160 --> 51:20.200
happy just doing everything on my phone and having it go through the Bluetooth audio.

51:20.200 --> 51:27.200
And I don't really need my radio because I'm not listening to radio and I don't listen

51:27.200 --> 51:30.520
to anything through the radio other than my phone now.

51:30.520 --> 51:33.120
So I thought, well, could I just get by with the phone?

51:33.120 --> 51:37.600
But the thing that this offers is A, your phone's still usable, but B, it puts it up

51:37.600 --> 51:42.200
on a bigger screen with more limited functionality that's focused for when you're driving and

51:42.200 --> 51:45.000
for like the navigation and the messages and stuff like that.

51:45.000 --> 51:48.120
I think I would prefer that and the ability to do search and stuff.

51:48.120 --> 51:50.360
So hello there.

51:50.360 --> 51:51.360
Who was that?

51:51.360 --> 51:52.360
Who was that?

51:52.360 --> 51:53.360
Dang.

51:53.360 --> 52:01.400
Now, would you prefer a Carputer with a touch screen or would you prefer one of those laptop

52:01.400 --> 52:02.400
mounts?

52:02.400 --> 52:07.000
That would be the way that would be the way Noah would go.

52:07.000 --> 52:10.640
Noah's got one of those in his Jeep, like one of those cop laptop mounts.

52:10.640 --> 52:13.840
Noah is such a gearhead, man.

52:13.840 --> 52:14.840
You know what?

52:14.840 --> 52:15.840
I tell you what, I don't know.

52:15.840 --> 52:16.840
I feel like that's too fiddly.

52:16.840 --> 52:19.520
See, that's what I'm liking about the Android Auto here on the Raspberry Pi.

52:19.520 --> 52:22.400
If you could get it mounted well, it could be out of the way, in the dash.

52:22.400 --> 52:26.120
It's like a distilled user interface that's simplified for while you're driving.

52:26.120 --> 52:27.120
It's less cluttered.

52:27.120 --> 52:31.160
And going to laptops, kind of like the opposite direction of that.

52:31.160 --> 52:32.160
Go ahead.

52:32.160 --> 52:36.800
I mean, you can use the Android Auto app to simulate this in order to get a feel for the

52:36.800 --> 52:38.360
Android Auto interface.

52:38.360 --> 52:39.760
Oh, yeah.

52:39.760 --> 52:40.760
That's another thing.

52:40.760 --> 52:42.760
Really, I already have the Raspberry Pi 3, I think.

52:42.760 --> 52:44.480
Isn't there one around here somewhere?

52:44.480 --> 52:45.480
There is one around here.

52:45.480 --> 52:47.040
Unless I've got to put it into use somewhere.

52:47.040 --> 52:48.040
So I already have that part.

52:48.040 --> 52:51.360
I just need the screen, and then it's sort of a low-cost test.

52:51.360 --> 52:52.880
It's pretty great that this guy is...

52:52.880 --> 52:54.840
Oh, by the way, that is getcrankshaft.com.

52:54.840 --> 52:56.240
I should have said the URL sooner.

52:56.240 --> 52:57.240
Sorry about that.

52:57.240 --> 53:00.400
Getcrankshaft.com is where you go.

53:00.400 --> 53:04.480
If anybody is going to scale, scale 16X, let me know if you've got something like that

53:04.480 --> 53:05.560
down there, because I want to see it.

53:05.560 --> 53:07.880
If you bring your car, let me see it.

53:07.880 --> 53:08.880
I want to see that.

53:08.880 --> 53:09.880
That'd be pretty cool.

53:09.880 --> 53:13.280
I want to give a quick mention, too, speaking of scale, I've been talking about scale in

53:13.280 --> 53:15.920
the new relaunched Tech Talk today, mentioned that last week.

53:15.920 --> 53:20.560
We've now posted two fricking episodes since last week's Linux Unplugged.

53:20.560 --> 53:21.560
What?

53:21.560 --> 53:22.560
Wow.

53:22.560 --> 53:23.560
Yeah.

53:23.560 --> 53:28.120
And there's some nostalgia, goodness, if you're a Linux action show former listener, there's

53:28.120 --> 53:35.580
some nostalgia, goodness, in episode 262, techtalk.today was where you find those, techtalk.today.

53:35.580 --> 53:39.520
And I'll be covering my journey to scale in that crap, up in that S, as they say.

53:39.520 --> 53:42.240
I'm really happy with the way those two episodes have turned out.

53:42.240 --> 53:45.720
It's been a bit of a creative endeavor, but I've enjoyed it.

53:45.720 --> 53:50.280
And it's gotten an itch, I had that rash right there I wanted to scratch, so I've been able

53:50.280 --> 53:51.280
to scratch that.

53:51.280 --> 53:52.280
It always feels good.

53:52.280 --> 53:53.280
Yeah.

53:53.280 --> 53:55.160
And it gives me a spot to put a bunch of content in scale, like the trip there and meeting

53:55.160 --> 53:56.160
people and all that stuff.

53:56.160 --> 53:58.400
And we get Tech Talk back for a brief little minute here.

53:58.400 --> 53:59.400
Yeah.

53:59.400 --> 54:00.400
For at least 10 episodes.

54:00.400 --> 54:04.160
So, season one, and we were two episodes in, so if you haven't gotten on board yet, they're

54:04.160 --> 54:05.160
shorter, too.

54:05.160 --> 54:07.160
They're about 20 minutes, so go to techtalk.today.

54:07.160 --> 54:08.160
Really easy, yeah.

54:08.160 --> 54:09.160
Ride this hype train with us.

54:09.160 --> 54:10.160
Easy peasy.

54:10.160 --> 54:15.240
If you want to catch up on two, it's a 40-minute podcast, and it's nice and tight.

54:15.240 --> 54:16.240
I hope people like it.

54:16.240 --> 54:20.680
I hope people like it, because I'm going to put all I can into it for the 10 episodes

54:20.680 --> 54:23.640
I'm going to do, and then I'm going to take a break, and I'm going to be done, and that's

54:23.640 --> 54:25.480
going to be wonderful.

54:25.480 --> 54:26.480
Wimpy has inspired me.

54:26.480 --> 54:27.480
You've taught me well, Wimpy.

54:27.480 --> 54:28.480
And the value of this is negative.

54:28.480 --> 54:29.480
You're welcome.

54:29.480 --> 54:30.480
No, it's not.

54:30.480 --> 54:31.480
I appreciate it.

54:31.480 --> 54:32.480
I appreciate it.

54:32.480 --> 54:33.480
That's season idea.

54:33.480 --> 54:34.480
Only, I may never come back, I think.

54:34.480 --> 54:35.480
Right, yeah.

54:35.480 --> 54:39.360
That might be the... My twist might be, last time I put the show on hold, it was on hold

54:39.360 --> 54:41.440
for two years, so.

54:41.440 --> 54:42.440
You never can tell.

54:42.440 --> 54:43.440
You never know.

54:43.440 --> 54:44.440
You never know.

54:44.440 --> 54:45.440
All right.

54:45.440 --> 54:46.440
Well, guess what?

54:46.440 --> 54:47.440
We're just about done here.

54:47.440 --> 54:49.800
We've been screwing around here, but this is just our low-key episode before I go to

54:49.800 --> 54:50.800
scale.

54:50.800 --> 54:55.840
So next week, I will be at scale with Noah, and I'm pretty sure we'll just do the show

54:55.840 --> 54:56.840
live from there.

54:56.840 --> 54:58.640
We'll just do a regular episode, but we'll happen to be at scale.

54:58.640 --> 55:01.000
I don't know if we'll... We might have a few interviews or something.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.320
If we get something good, we'll put it in the show.

55:03.320 --> 55:04.320
So you'll be here?

55:04.320 --> 55:05.320
Yeah.

55:05.320 --> 55:08.440
Wes is going to come into studio and try to run all this crap on your own.

55:08.440 --> 55:09.440
Good luck with that.

55:09.440 --> 55:10.440
Jeez, Louise.

55:10.440 --> 55:12.000
We'll probably have an episode.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.000
Let's just say that.

55:13.000 --> 55:15.480
We'll be down there throwing our crap together while you're in here trying to remember how

55:15.480 --> 55:19.720
to turn all this stuff back on, and one way or another, we should end up with a show next

55:19.720 --> 55:20.720
week.

55:20.720 --> 55:21.720
Oh, yeah.

55:21.720 --> 55:24.520
Speaking of shows coming back, rumor has it the Ubuntu podcast is coming back, so go get

55:24.520 --> 55:25.720
more wimpy.

55:25.720 --> 55:26.720
That's exciting.

55:26.720 --> 55:27.720
Yup.

55:27.720 --> 55:28.720
The Ubuntu podcast is on the return.

55:28.720 --> 55:29.720
The rumor is true.

55:29.720 --> 55:30.720
Ah.

55:30.720 --> 55:34.560
And if you want more Wes Payne, why not a little TechSnap?

55:34.560 --> 55:39.160
Dot Systems for the TechSnap program, which is back and better than ever.

55:39.160 --> 55:43.680
If I don't say so myself, TechSnap.Systems, and at Wes Payne on Twitter.

55:43.680 --> 55:45.400
I'm at Chris LAS.

55:45.400 --> 55:47.680
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

55:47.680 --> 55:50.320
Stick around for Ask Noah if you're on the live stream.

55:50.320 --> 55:51.320
Noah's coming up.

55:51.320 --> 55:52.320
Yeah, definitely.

55:52.320 --> 55:53.320
He's got a pretty special guest.

55:53.320 --> 55:54.320
Pretty, pretty special.

55:54.320 --> 55:57.400
I won't say anymore, but that's coming up soon.

55:57.400 --> 56:01.000
You show up on Tuesdays, and you stick around for Linux Unplugged, you join the virtual

56:01.000 --> 56:05.360
plug, hang out in our chat room, and then sit back and enjoy the Ask Noah show.

56:05.360 --> 56:07.120
You could even call in and ask him a question.

56:07.120 --> 56:08.120
That's how that kind of thing works.

56:08.120 --> 56:12.320
It's a Tuesday Linux sandwich, and you can get the times at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash

56:12.320 --> 56:13.320
calendar.

56:13.320 --> 56:14.320
Also, our Reddit's at linuxunpluggedatreddit.com.

56:14.320 --> 56:15.320
Thanks for being here.

56:15.320 --> 56:16.320
See you next week.

56:16.320 --> 56:34.840
I'm Chris LAS, and I'll see you next week.

56:34.840 --> 56:58.920
All right, let's get a title, Noah.

56:58.920 --> 56:59.920
Let's get out of here.

56:59.920 --> 57:00.920
Oh, a title.

57:00.920 --> 57:01.920
Great idea.

57:01.920 --> 57:02.920
Yeah, we got to get a title.

57:02.920 --> 57:03.920
We gots to get some titles.

57:03.920 --> 57:04.920
We got to get a title today, huh?

57:04.920 --> 57:05.920
Good title.

57:05.920 --> 57:06.920
Hello, Eric.

57:06.920 --> 57:07.920
That's awesome.

57:07.920 --> 57:10.160
Is your weed extraction process done over there?

57:10.160 --> 57:11.800
Did it all work out?

57:11.800 --> 57:15.840
Dude, seriously, once you guys started talking about the Carputer stuff, I totally could

57:15.840 --> 57:17.720
jump in because I have one.

57:17.720 --> 57:20.400
I have an Android one, but then a leaf blower came by.

57:20.400 --> 57:21.400
You had a windstorm over there.

57:21.400 --> 57:22.400
Yeah, nice.

57:22.400 --> 57:23.400
Well, you know, that's what happens.

57:23.400 --> 57:24.400
That's what happens.

57:24.400 --> 57:25.400
Oh, the windstorm.

57:25.400 --> 57:26.960
That's my furnace.

57:26.960 --> 57:33.000
The smell of Free Breeze, that's pretty good tech, Mav, but probably a little too esoteric.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.640
What do you got?

57:34.640 --> 57:35.640
Anybody else got a title?

57:35.640 --> 57:36.640
What else do we got?

57:36.640 --> 57:37.640
KDE Freedom?

57:37.640 --> 57:38.640
No.

57:38.640 --> 57:39.640
Scanning.

57:39.640 --> 57:40.640
Indications negative.

57:40.640 --> 57:41.640
Accessing.

57:41.640 --> 57:42.640
Crankshaft.

57:42.640 --> 57:43.640
Accessing.

57:43.640 --> 57:44.640
Scanning.

57:44.640 --> 57:45.640
Scanning.

57:45.640 --> 57:46.640
Crankshaft.

57:46.640 --> 57:51.640
I have a Tech Talk Today question.

57:51.640 --> 57:53.760
Yes, sir.

57:53.760 --> 57:59.520
The feeds that I found in Pocket Cast for Tech Talk Today aren't being updated.

57:59.520 --> 58:00.520
Have you checked them recently?

58:00.520 --> 58:02.960
Because they had a bug on their server side thing with the feed.

58:02.960 --> 58:03.960
Oh, okay.

58:03.960 --> 58:04.960
Let me try again.

58:04.960 --> 58:06.440
Yeah, that would be no good.

58:06.440 --> 58:11.520
I just Googled the... I just Googled for Tech Talk Today and went to the one that's

58:11.520 --> 58:12.520
listed on the website.

58:12.520 --> 58:18.520
Yeah, if you want to just put it in, it's just techtalk.today slash RSS, if you want

58:18.520 --> 58:19.520
to just put it in.

58:19.520 --> 58:21.920
By the way, nice new logo.

58:21.920 --> 58:22.920
With the feet?

58:22.920 --> 58:26.800
Well, I mean, it's different than the one you had last time.

58:26.800 --> 58:27.800
Yeah.

58:27.800 --> 58:28.800
Little tweaked, yeah.

58:28.800 --> 58:29.800
Fascinating.

58:29.800 --> 58:30.800
Mmm.

58:30.800 --> 58:31.800
Yep.

58:31.800 --> 58:33.360
Yay, B-titles, yay, B-titles.

58:33.360 --> 58:35.400
You've got to constantly iterate.

58:35.400 --> 58:36.800
Not much there on J.B. Titles.

58:36.800 --> 58:37.800
Oh, there's a little bore.

58:37.800 --> 58:39.600
There's a little more.

58:39.600 --> 58:41.640
Crank that Foss shaft.

58:41.640 --> 58:43.080
Crankshaft on the move.

58:43.080 --> 58:44.880
Can we GTK all live together?

58:44.880 --> 58:47.520
I have the power.

58:47.520 --> 58:49.300
People are reaching deep this week.

58:49.300 --> 58:50.300
People are reaching deep.

58:50.300 --> 58:51.300
I appreciate it.

58:51.300 --> 58:52.300
Auto freedom.

58:52.300 --> 58:53.300
I appreciate it.

58:53.300 --> 58:54.300
People are reaching deep.

58:54.300 --> 58:55.300
Easy Linux.

58:55.300 --> 58:56.300
Small and cool.

58:56.300 --> 58:57.300
Bad news, Chris.

58:57.300 --> 58:58.300
What's that?

58:58.300 --> 59:03.440
Pocket Cast says it's from September years ago.

59:03.440 --> 59:06.000
I don't know what's going on with that.

59:06.000 --> 59:12.040
Now what if you put in techtalk.today slash RSS?

59:12.040 --> 59:18.880
Does it pull down a new, does the old RSS still show the old logo, Wimpy?

59:18.880 --> 59:20.440
Yeah.

59:20.440 --> 59:22.240
Okay.

59:22.240 --> 59:28.760
Usually Pocket Cast is very up to date when it comes to logos and all that.

59:28.760 --> 59:29.760
Pocket Cast.

59:29.760 --> 59:30.760
I'm going to go get Chris.

59:30.760 --> 59:31.760
Whoa.

59:31.760 --> 59:32.760
Colonel, you have a hot day.

59:32.760 --> 59:33.760
Holy shit.

59:33.760 --> 59:34.760
Maybe that's what he was going for.

59:34.760 --> 59:35.760
Is that Noah?

59:35.760 --> 59:36.760
Is that Noah?

59:36.760 --> 59:37.760
Yeah.

59:37.760 --> 59:38.760
Noah sounds terrible.

59:38.760 --> 59:39.760
Yo, Noah.

59:39.760 --> 59:40.760
Yeah.

59:40.760 --> 59:41.760
I can barely hear you.

59:41.760 --> 59:42.760
I thought my audio was bad.

59:42.760 --> 59:43.760
Yeah.

59:43.760 --> 59:44.760
He's also operating a wood chipper at the moment.

59:44.760 --> 59:45.760
He's probably just got too much for me.

59:45.760 --> 59:46.760
Yeah.

59:46.760 --> 59:58.520
So the updated RSS is just fine, but the old feed in it, I got to talk to him.

59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.520
We actually, we talked, we had it.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.520
So that was an issue.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.520
We talked to him.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.520
I said, okay, we got it fixed now.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:06.200
And then the person that we were working with said it was working, but I don't actually

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.200
use Pocket Cast myself.

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.600
So I'm installing it right now.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:12.200
Although by the way, there's actually a newer app that I would recommend to people who are

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.040
not on Pocket Cast yet.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.740
It's called Cast Box.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:17.740
It seems to be-

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:18.740
Jesus, Noah.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:19.740
I don't know.

01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:20.740
Is this-

01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:21.740
Noah, you stop.

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:22.740
You're ruining my post-show.

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:23.740
Here, let me hit stop on the recording.

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:46.880
You just destroyed my post-show.
