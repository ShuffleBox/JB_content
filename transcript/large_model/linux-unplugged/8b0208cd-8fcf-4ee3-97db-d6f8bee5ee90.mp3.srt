1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's so much better for remote desktops than even something like Budgie, because obviously it's a lot lighter and you haven't got to worry about heavy compositing, heavy shadows and all these gradients and stuff.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And for remote desktop in and to my NUC or server, whichever is running it, it's fantastic.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You know, XFCE stands out for me as there was this workstation when I was at a school district that ran Debian and XFCE and then I came back nearly 10 years later and it was still running Debian and XFCE and it was just like the same rock solid.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
They went to that machine, they opened up a terminal, they SSH into the servers and that's all it did.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So yeah, I know a lot of people that still use XFCE. I think it kind of gets less attention than it probably deserves, but mostly because of its very nature, I think.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Are you not ever tempted to replace it?

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Well, I mean, going forward, I think the thing that's going to play against XFCE is the lack of high DPI for a lot of people.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's starting to become a bit of a problem.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Although maybe that might be the XFCE crowd might be sort of the later adopters of that, right?

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
True. I mean, GTK itself, you know, you need GTK free for that stuff.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So once they start to go that road, then, you know, they kind of solve those problems and they're partially there.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
As far as remote desktop goes, do you think Mate or Mate would also fit the bill?

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I mean, it could. I mean...

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's got this brisk menu you might check out.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah, if it's got brisk menu.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 183 for February 7th, 2017.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that at least half of us can barely breathe.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
My name is Chris.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
My name is Wes.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And I don't think it's you. I think you sound good.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's good.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thank you.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hello, Wes.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You know what, Wes? We've got a great show today.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So we have some open source projects to get into that I'm very excited to cover.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
One of my favorite projects got a huge update this week.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Actually, I shouldn't say one.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
One, two, three that I can see just on this list right here.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm super excited to talk about.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So we'll be digging into that.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Then Google's got something that's going to blow your mind.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's really something.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We've got a big warning for those of you that are using the Ubuntu on Windows environment.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We've covered that in the past if you've been trying that out.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Huge disclaimer coming up in the show for you.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You need to know about it because data is getting lost.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
2011 to find out.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Dun, dun, dun.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And then towards the end of the show, not even the end, but as we get into the final chapters.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
To prepare ourselves for the end.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We will be talking about something that I suspect has been on the minds of a lot of our listeners.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Not all of them.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Those lovely listeners.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Just the ones that are a little cranky.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Now we're going to talk about some things that have been sent into the show as feedback.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And I think are a great opportunity to address them.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And talk about the bigger picture.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What's going on here.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Plus, Wes, on top of all that stuff, you know what else we got?

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We got that tried and true great virtual lug who's here to join us for yet another episode.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hello.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hello.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hello.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So let's start with one of the projects I'm thrilled to announce as an update today.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, we have breaking news here on the show.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is CNN breaking news.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Kodi 17 is out.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The Krypton release is here, which brings its new user interface, better organization settings,

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and lots and lots and lots of under the hood changes on the video player, music library,

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
PVR, audio support, and massive Android things.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And tons and tons and tons and tons of small bug fixes and improvements to stability.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So let's start with the new look.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's got the new skin.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And it's been designed for the 10-foot interface, while touchscreens have their new touchscreens.

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I like that.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And there's some samples here.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I was just kind of surprise updated on my NVIDIA Shield TV.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Oh, really?

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, just one day.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I opened it up.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm like, holy crap, I got 17.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Like I was waiting and waiting and waiting.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Then one day, boom, there it is.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Check out this, Wes.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The video engine is undergoing a multi-phase rewrite, and Kodi 17 delivers the next wave

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
of changes with improvements to stability, audio and video synchronization, refresh rate

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
switching, decoding and encoding to video, which obviously is pretty important.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
They've also got hardware accelerated playback of DVDs, OpenGL dithering, new and improved

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
support for lots of streaming protocols and upgrades and updates to things like RTMP support

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and MPEG dash, which would be-

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Nice.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's useful for us.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Exactly.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And I really like seeing this.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Kodi on Linux can now use some simple color profile stuff to color correct displays on

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Linux.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No way.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's really pushing into the premium stuff.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It is, really.

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah.

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You know, when you get a really nice television or whatever your display is.

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, right.

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If you have it, you might as well use that.

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, yeah.

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Also, the PVR stuff has gotten a lot of new functionality, which includes live TV support.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But like I said, the one that I'm really excited about is with Kodi 17, there's one downside

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
if you're an Android user is there's now a minimum requirement of Android 5.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I think I can handle that.

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yeah.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
However, that with it brings the official audio API for Android, which is probably a

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
really good thing for multiple reasons, which means you also get DTS-HD and DTS-X and Dolby

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
TrueHD and Dolby Atmos pass through.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Boy, when you combine that with the color correction stuff and whatnot, I mean, this

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
is getting to be a seriously premium home theater product.

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Can I admit something?

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah.

111
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I have yet to try Kodi on Android.

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh, it's good.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I know.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Isn't that ridiculous?

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Oh, it's good.

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You know, I wish the Shield, I wish Nvidia could bring the Shield TV down in price because

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I really think it's a pretty great box.

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I think it's almost $200.

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
They just updated it.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But you could probably pick up a used one off of eBay because they first gen.

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And you know, I found one that was a lot cheaper that's pretty great, too.

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
So there's other good ones out there.

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The thing I would have to say about this, and I know I talk about it too much, but the

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
thing I would have to say about the Shield TV is now I'm like six months into it, almost

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
more than that, I think.

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And solid, consistent, really great updates.

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Like every update that lands, I'm like, oh, awesome.

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let me download that.

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And mind you, I'm on a MiFi connection.

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And I got two of these things now.

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So I'm downloading two gigs of updates because each are a gig.

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You need that Steam caching thing we were talking about.

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yeah, really.

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But you know, like recently, one of the updates not only brought the latest monthly Android

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
security updates, which I'm a big fan of, but also turned on Prime Video.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So now you get Hulu, Netflix, you get YouTube, of course.

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's nice, yeah.

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You get Prime Video, Sling TV.

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's really if you're a cord cutter.

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Does it do DLNA?

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Oh, yeah.

142
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, of course.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Nice.

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Well, then you've also got full-fledged Kodi.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's also it.

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The Shield TV itself can be a Plex server.

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And it can also support external storage.

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Okay.

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Wow.

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Or, of course, can be a first class Plex client.

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Right.

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So it's such a good little powerful TV box.

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You combine it with Kodi and it is the most rock solid home theater setup I've ever had.

154
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And I've been like refining this for so many years.

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You know, people have listened to the Linux action shows since the very early days.

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Remember when I was talking to a gentleman who was building a PC where the only thing

157
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
this PC was going to do was this entire multimedia center is going to be home automation and

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
multimedia PVR DVR and you put it in there.

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Everything from this monstrosity to different iterations of myth TV to different iterations

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
of different front end players with back end Linux servers.

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What I've really found now is big centralized storage and beer Plex front ends and then

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Android TV for the front end player.

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And it's such a slick, smooth setup.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Everything is supported.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Anything you'd want to play.

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And it's so trouble free.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
If you if you want something where you just sit down, you wake the device up and you start

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
watching your TV and you don't have to sit there and fiddle with things every now and

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
then.

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This is so that does it trouble you that like maybe your storage is free BSD and then your

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
client is an Android thing.

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, my storage is Linux for this setup.

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You're right here at the studio.

174
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's free.

175
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's free now.

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah.

177
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And the front end being Android.

178
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You know, the thing is, is once Linux has has gotten like if they can get like Ubuntu

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
core something where they have transactional updates where I get monthly images that come

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
down, it flashes my system, it reboots and I'm running the new version has that recovery

181
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
kind of rollback.

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah.

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Then I think then if you're willing to say, all right, well, I'll forfeit Netflix and

184
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Hulu and prime TV and sling TV for a little while.

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
So that way I can use Kodi on Linux.

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If that's really what your goal is, that I think is achievable, either through like through

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
using a sophisticated snapshots or waiting for something like Ubuntu core to come around

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
with Kodi built on top of it, which could be a killer distribution through because then

189
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
you get transactional updates or even Fedora with, you know, with the project atomic something

190
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
that gives you transactional updates because you want when you're sitting down to watch

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
TV, you generally want to relax.

192
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yeah, it's an appliance.

193
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And even if you know how to fix it, like you don't want to roll hell in the SSH and to

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
my TV, I will.

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And you're just like, oh, everyone watch this cool video I found.

196
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I want to show it to you.

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So just give me like 10 minutes.

198
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It'll be fine.

199
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Having tried to pull this off in different iterations now for a decade, I have so many

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
times been gone to show somebody something and it fails and I'm like, oh, let me fix

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
my TV set up first and then I can play this video.

202
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And granted, maybe it's only five times over 10 years.

203
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But each time it bites you.

204
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You never let it go.

205
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And you've completely lost that person as a convert.

206
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Like they're not they're totally not sold on your set up when you go to play video and

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
it fails.

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So I've that's where I've kind of slid to using Android for my television.

209
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I love it.

210
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But you get the apps, you get the reliability.

211
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And if you get a good OEM, you get updates, you get good updates.

212
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's what I think it takes to use to for me to trust to use Android.

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So Cody 17 Krypton release is out.

214
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't see producer Michael in the Mumble Room.

215
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Otherwise, I'd ask him if he had any other.

216
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You have any thoughts on the new Krypton release from an add on perspective or just from a

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
general release perspective?

218
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Not as far as like anything from the beta differences like the it's more polished and it runs a

219
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
lot more streamlined than I expect.

220
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What about from like 16?

221
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Like if that because I didn't really use the beta as much myself.

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I just sort of waited.

223
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Well, as far as like the interface is amazing.

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Like it's such a huge improvement.

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes.

226
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Like this.

227
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It goes from a thing that looked like 10 years ago to something that's modern and stuff like

228
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
that.

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yeah.

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And everything's really quick.

231
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Like you get access to stuff a lot faster with this new layout.

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Once it's up to you can totally grok what everything does.

233
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The navigation is easier.

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's like where the old interface with confluence there was like to do one thing there was like

235
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
four or five different ways and you have to like configure it in different ways to make

236
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
it do it in the like the order you want it to do.

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And now it's just so much better.

238
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Like as far as like the differences between the betas and stuff and the current release

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
is actually not that much.

240
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But the differences between 16 and 17 is just like massively drastic.

241
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Like it's fantastic.

242
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And surprisingly, the new Krypton interface is actually like really fast.

243
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I kind of expected to be an underperformer, but it's not.

244
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Now, am I going to have all of my awesome add ons break?

245
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
No, you might have some add on break depending on if they're paying attention or not.

246
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Like there are certain features that the APIs changed throughout the 16, 17 switch.

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But there was plenty of time and there was a before the betas even came out there was

248
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
a lot of API talk for developers to have a lot of headway so that they have at least

249
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
a year before their release was even out.

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So they had plenty of time to actually make the transition.

251
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So one of the things that's really nice about Kodi is this add on system allows for anybody

252
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
even who's somebody who might be a quasi competitor to come along and develop an add on.

253
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We covered this before, but obviously there's an MB add on that uses your MB database.

254
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh yeah, there is.

255
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
So all your metadata and your watch status are synced across your Kodi machines.

256
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But the Crazy Cats at Plex also released a Plex add on for Kodi and I've had time to

257
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
play with it.

258
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Oh, have you?

259
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh, good.

260
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So it's like a full on new, you go into almost a new UI mode for Kodi.

261
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's a full on application.

262
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh, interesting.

263
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And then you still are using Kodi for the playback because you can still hear Kodi sounds

264
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
like the whoosh, whoosh, like little noises Kodi makes.

265
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's the test of a true Kodi user.

266
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yeah, sweet, sweet.

267
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You hear that still when it's playing and it fast forwards and rewinds better than Plex

268
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
ever does.

269
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Sure.

270
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But it's supporting like Plex's automatic play the next episode features.

271
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's marking them red on the Plex database as you watch them through Kodi.

272
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's nice.

273
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The kids were using it over the weekend and the thing that really pushed it over the edge

274
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
is now you can bark at the Echo and you can say Echo open Plex, Echo play Steven Universe

275
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
season one episode 40.

276
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Wow.

277
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And it plays it on the predefined player that you've chosen already.

278
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That's pretty slick.

279
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It can be the Plex player if you have Plex add-on open in Kodi and you set it up on the

280
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Echo, you can actually have the Echo remotely trigger videos.

281
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Through the Plex API.

282
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah.

283
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Wow.

284
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Okay, that's pretty cool.

285
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's crazy.

286
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Does that add-on support direct play like where the Kodi does all the decoding?

287
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes.

288
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

289
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Nice.

290
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah, yeah.

291
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
In fact, I believe, I don't know for sure because pretty much all my stuff is standardized

292
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
now on x264.

293
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah.

294
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But I think it will play it back anything directly that Kodi supports.

295
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's great.

296
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yeah.

297
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yeah.

298
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And I have not had a chance to try it yet.

299
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Mr. Michael, is there anything else you wanted to add on the Kodi stuff before we move on?

300
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Not really.

301
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Well, there is actually an interesting article out there talking about the reputation of

302
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Kodi having...

303
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Right.

304
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Other than that, that's kind of like...

305
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Kodi is not a piracy app.

306
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah, exactly.

307
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That was the article.

308
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah, exactly.

309
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah.

310
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But it's funny because there's like the Kodi Twitter account is kind of funny to watch.

311
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yeah.

312
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Someone might want to be interested in that.

313
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Like...

314
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That's a good suggestion.

315
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah.

316
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,720
There's people who will send messages to Kodi that are obviously pirating thing and Kodi

317
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,600
will respond with a joke back to them saying, yeah, we don't care.

318
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Yeah.

319
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,500
They're basically probably trying to shame people for doing piracy and they're really

320
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,000
trying to position themselves as we're not a piracy application.

321
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Exactly.

322
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Probably a good thing.

323
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Especially the legal trouble.

324
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
They've been sort of – well, not they, but people that are selling Kodi boxes are

325
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
failing.

326
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,360
And like it would be a shame for that to be its reputation when it's just getting so

327
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
good.

328
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
Right.

329
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,440
And meanwhile, companies like Vizio are legitimately screwing their customers and this is why all

330
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,260
of our hardware, even our televisions really should be open.

331
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,520
They're going to have to pay $2.2 million for what they did but according to a complaint

332
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,400
filed Monday by the FTC here in the US, the internet connected TVs from Vizio contained

333
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,680
ACR which was short for automated content recognition software.

334
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,440
Without asking for permission, the ACR code captured second by second information about

335
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,100
the video the TV displayed.

336
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,720
The software collected other personal information and then transmitted along with the viewing

337
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,400
data to servers controlled by Vizio.

338
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:23,320
Vizio then sold it to unnamed third parties for purposes of audience measurement, analysis

339
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
and tracking.

340
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,640
Of course, you could see Vizio doing this like we've got this great data on Vizio users

341
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,520
and Vizio televisions are featured in Costco with millions of sales and we'll sell this

342
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,520
to you.

343
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,640
And you know, TiVo tried to do this.

344
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,640
They all tried to do this.

345
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
Oh yeah.

346
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,240
And you can totally see why advertisers and marketers want that information.

347
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,960
And I doubt Vizio, very much doubt Vizio is the only smart TV manufacturer doing this.

348
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Certainly not, right?

349
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,960
They just got caught.

350
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,080
So check this out.

351
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,920
For all of these uses, defendants provided highly specific second by second information

352
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
about the television viewing.

353
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,020
This is according to FTC lawyers in Monday's complaint.

354
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,480
Each line of the report provides viewing information about a single television.

355
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,120
In a securities filing, Vizio states that its data analytics program, for example, will

356
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,000
provide highly specific viewing behavior data on a massive scale with great accuracy.

357
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh.

358
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes.

359
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,600
Which can be used to generate intelligent insights for advertisers.

360
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,360
So this is why I don't want podcasts to ever go to like, I don't, if you listen to the

361
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,440
show in, what's that, oh, what's it called?

362
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
Oh, I forget.

363
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,880
It's, it's like this, it's like streams all of the podcasts together.

364
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,040
It's a, it's a, it's a Stitcher, Stitcher, Stitcher, Stitcher.

365
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,200
If you listen in Stitcher, or if you listen to podcasts using the Google Play Store podcast

366
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,880
directory, please consider getting your podcasts from somewhere else.

367
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,520
Because what these companies are doing are trying to do this kind of data analytics to

368
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
podcasting.

369
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,920
So right now, we're going to get into an ad.

370
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,240
And I'm going to say go to linux.ting.com.

371
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,800
That's the only tracking that happens.

372
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,280
If you go to linux.ting.com and you get a device or you get, you sign up, that's where

373
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,280
the tracking starts and ends.

374
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
You know we sent you.

375
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,280
Right.

376
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,480
But what, what Stitcher does and Google Play does is they're trying to do to podcasts what

377
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,920
Vizio is doing to television, where they're trying to figure out where you turned your

378
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,480
volume up or down, when you pause, when you rewind, when you fast forward, they want all

379
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
of that.

380
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,640
And they get that Google Play and Stitcher collect that constantly while you're using

381
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,920
their apps and send those metrics off to the advertisers.

382
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,720
So this is a dirty thing that it's where podcasts are really on the line of this happening to.

383
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,600
And if some of these services start to get more and more popular, I feel like this could

384
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,920
be a, this could be a bad case.

385
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,200
So Vizio also, by the way, not denying this.

386
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,600
They wrote in an official note, they say the ACR program was never paired with viewing

387
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,220
data, was never paired viewing data with personal identified information such as contact information.

388
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,780
But they do admit they were collecting this information to aggregate a summary of reports.

389
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,880
But here's the problem.

390
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:55,160
If you look at the data, well, it turns out the software periodically appended IP addresses

391
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,100
and also appended other data to make it possible to collect other information about the viewer

392
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,880
like your age, your sex, your income, your marital status, household size, education

393
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,280
level, home ownership status and home value, which all could be associated and provided

394
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,400
to the advertiser.

395
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,400
The collection occurred under a setting that was described as a smart interactivity feature

396
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,380
that enables program offers and suggestions.

397
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,960
The menu never informs users that the feature also transmitted viewing habits and other

398
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
personal information.

399
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,280
Now I kind of want to see like a Wireshark log as one of these TVs.

400
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,380
I've wondered because we have a Vizio here in the studio and one day we were just sitting

401
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,040
out there in the living room and a Wi-Fi access point on that Vizio came online for a little

402
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,600
bit and then shut down.

403
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,920
We didn't, we hadn't changed it, we didn't, nothing, just, yeah.

404
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,200
So anyways, under the terms of the settlement, Vizio is going to pay 1.5 million to the FTC

405
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,760
and 700,000 to New Jersey's Division of Consumer Affairs.

406
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,240
The settlement also requires Vizio to delete all of the collected data before March 1,

407
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,240
2016.

408
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,160
There was an aspect to the story though that really made me feel like, God, I do not like

409
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:01,000
this part of it and I really wish like Ubuntu TV had been more successful or something.

410
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,560
Or Firefox, that was a thing.

411
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,400
You know, looking back at it retrospectively too, it feels like, it feels like if Canonical

412
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,560
had really pushed on Ubuntu TV maybe over the phone or tablet, because you know, by

413
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,960
the way, you know the BQ tablet, the Ubuntu tablet, it's over a year old now, it's gone

414
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,860
nowhere, it's gone nowhere.

415
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:24,320
So if they could have solved this television program problem, this host OS you need for

416
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,920
the TV, there's still a hole for this.

417
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:33,200
But here's the part I really didn't like and this is why I really wish we could have gotten

418
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,080
like Ubuntu TV or something.

419
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,120
So for those of us who bought old televisions, like we bought our TVs a while ago, like this

420
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:46,440
one here in the studio, they retroactively sent software updates over the internet to

421
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,320
these smart televisions to add this feature and to turn it on.

422
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,600
So you could have a two-year-old television, they're like, oh well, I checked off all the

423
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,520
bad privacy things when I set it up.

424
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Yeah, yeah.

425
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,000
And then boom, a software update comes along, turns it on and starts sending.

426
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That's like not even the chance for consent.

427
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,080
No, and I just think that's so creepy and of course they're the only ones caught, right?

428
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,240
So, yeah.

429
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,880
Let's get some open source on all the things.

430
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,720
Speaking of Ubuntu phone though, there is an update running out to Ubuntu phone users,

431
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,280
OTA 15, to phones and tablets, primarily a bug fix update.

432
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,600
It's also going to address an issue with loading HTTPS sites on the stock Ubuntu web browser.

433
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,600
I do like me my HTTPS.

434
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,760
Don't worry if you're not seeing your update yet.

435
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,000
This is the start of a phased upgrade procedure that they're going to follow which should

436
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,860
take really less than a day or two for everybody to see the update.

437
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,880
So the other thing I thought was really great about this article that Joey wrote for OMG

438
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,060
Ubuntu is he breaks down the difference between Ubuntu touch and Ubuntu personal because this

439
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:56,800
is how Canonical screws it up every time, is they sort of evolve the language or they

440
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,700
weren't initially clear about it or it's changed as what they're doing has changed and the

441
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,960
internet doesn't catch up.

442
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,320
Where I think Canonical kind of trips up on this is messaging the changes.

443
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:14,200
A lot of times it just gets appended to a completely non-story.

444
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:21,160
So in the story about an update for Ubuntu phone that nobody cares about, I mean in consideration

445
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,400
of the entire audience size, obviously there's people that listen to this show that care

446
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
a lot about it.

447
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:33,480
But looking at the entire mobile industry, that's not even just Ubuntu users, it's not

448
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,480
a big story.

449
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,680
And in this big story is a great explanation of how all of the vernacular works.

450
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:45,040
So Ubuntu touch is technically just Ubuntu, wherever it runs it's just Ubuntu.

451
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,560
And so Canonical says they're trying to evolve their terminology to provide better distinction

452
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,560
between various eras of Ubuntu mobile devices.

453
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,720
Ubuntu touch is the popular term given to the mobile oriented version of Ubuntu based

454
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,160
on Ubuntu 1504 that uses click packages and ships pre-installed on all of the commercial

455
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,800
Ubuntu smartphones.

456
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:09,080
Ubuntu personal is the official name given to the snapified version of Ubuntu that will

457
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,760
form the successor to Ubuntu touch, which is currently based on Ubuntu 1604 and uses

458
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,120
the snap package format.

459
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:22,520
So Ubuntu personal uses the snap package format based on 1604, Ubuntu touch is 1504 that uses

460
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
click packages.

461
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
Clear?

462
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:30,960
Is there a diagram I can see, that's what I would like, I can just print it out, I can

463
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,160
bring it for the show so I don't say the wrong thing.

464
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,160
I know, right?

465
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,880
Hey, while we're talking about mobile, why don't I mention Ting, linux.ting.com.

466
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,160
Go there, sign up and when you go to our website, or our URL I should say, linux.ting.com, they'll

467
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,120
take $25 off a device or if you bring one and they have CDMA and GSM compatibility,

468
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,560
they'll give you $25 in service credit.

469
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,000
No contract, no other termination fee and you only pay for what you use.

470
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,640
It's $6 for the line and then it's just your usage.

471
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,480
When you need help, you talk to a real human being.

472
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,520
No hold, no phone trees, no transfers, it's the kind of level of service that you would

473
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,040
think only like the hugest telco company could afford and of course once you get to that

474
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,040
scale, what do you do?

475
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,040
You outsource it.

476
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,760
Ting is a totally different type of mobile network and this is why they're able to do

477
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,200
things a little differently.

478
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,120
So instead of having to invest in every single cell tower they build and fight with the local

479
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,640
legislation and get all the licensing and figure out all of the clearances that they

480
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,840
need, Ting works on top of other existing established mobile carriers to bring you sort

481
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,080
of a hybrid mobile service so you get to pick between CDMA or GSM and they're able to focus

482
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,920
on things like great customer service, fantastic tools to manage your account and of course

483
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,520
a great selection of devices.

484
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,120
They also just recently announced they'd be bringing on Ring Plus customers.

485
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:53,280
I guess there was a bit of a falling up between Ring Plus and their parent carrier and Ting

486
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,440
is a great company, backed by two cows, really knows how to do this, been around for a while

487
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,160
and so they're stepping up and they're going to offer service to Ring Plus customers.

488
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,080
So if that's you, you're going to have until Friday, February 11th to decide if you want

489
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
to stay with Ting or not.

490
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,040
They're not going to make it hard to leave too, if you don't want to, they're just a

491
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
great company.

492
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,640
They've got a great blog you can follow even if you're not a Ting customer.

493
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,640
When you're ready to get started, go to linux.ting.com.

494
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,720
See how much you would save by using this what would you save button right here.

495
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,280
See the unbelievable prices and then bring a device or grab a device from Google Play

496
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:32,240
or Ting store directly or just a SIM card, if that's what you need, linux.ting.com.

497
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,400
Thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

498
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
They're the best.

499
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,280
I love this update.

500
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,360
This is good, good stuff.

501
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Speaking of the best, I think Plasma 5.9 is the best update to the Plasma desktop ever,

502
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:53,500
ever, ever, ever and the best Plasma desktop release just got better with Plasma 5.9.1.

503
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:59,800
Just some fixes, some breeze fixes, some discover fixes, other little things like that.

504
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,960
I don't have really a lot to say other than I'm just going to check in with my Plasma

505
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,560
usage because typically in the past, what's happened is I've switched to Plasma, I use

506
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,640
it, I use it, I use it, something breaks in production with the audio or with – you

507
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,640
know, after an update, something breaks and I bail quietly.

508
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,120
Now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to kind of check in from time to time, say

509
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,920
yeah, I'm still using it, this is what I'm finding to be the best configuration so far.

510
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,160
I've been really happy with Neon so far.

511
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,160
Oh, that's awesome.

512
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,120
But also had a lot of success with Plasmon Arch too.

513
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:40,680
I still to this day, if you use it on my main workstation, it's just been super rock solid

514
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,680
flawless.

515
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Oh, that's great.

516
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,960
I don't know how – I think we're like week two or three in this.

517
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,840
I think we've been having this update for like three weeks now and I'm still at that

518
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,720
stage where I walk in, the door opens and I set my bag down and I sit my butt in the

519
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,200
chair and my hands on the keyboard and I'm going to work and until I finish working,

520
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
it's completely flawless.

521
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
There's been no issues.

522
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,400
I've been able to produce multiple shows on it.

523
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,940
I did some quick editing on it the other day under KDM Live.

524
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,680
It was nailing it, checking all the boxes.

525
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:14,520
So if you've been considering trying the Plasma Desktop 5.9, really good release.

526
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,560
One of the things I'm really loving is the notification for screenshots is great.

527
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,320
It just feels so good, Wes.

528
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,600
It feels so good.

529
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,080
So 5.9.1 is out.

530
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,960
Mumbleroom, does anybody want to jump in on the whole plasma love thing before I move

531
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
on?

532
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
I just want to give them a quick shout out.

533
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
Would you be willing to try it?

534
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
Yeah.

535
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
Oh, absolutely I would.

536
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Yeah?

537
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
All right.

538
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
I'll get that going this week.

539
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
You should.

540
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,960
Yeah.

541
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,120
Just give it a go and see what you think because I actually – I think in my head, even though

542
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,500
I know better, I think in my head I got the idea that the KDE whole application suite

543
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:52,320
and the Plasma Desktop specifically were slow and bloated and the little test I did this

544
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,360
past weekend for the Linux Action Show, I threw it on a 10-year-old PC and just blown

545
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
away by the performance.

546
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,500
I mean I'm consistently impressed like when we talk about articles about KWin and other

547
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
parts of the stack.

548
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,360
There's a lot of KDE applications I like already.

549
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
Yeah.

550
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
There's a lot to that stack too though.

551
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,360
There is.

552
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
That's true.

553
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,000
I feel like the whole thing is getting to the point where I can just drop it on here.

554
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I feel like it's getting there.

555
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
All right.

556
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Scrapjaw, you want to jump in?

557
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Yeah.

558
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,680
I switched my mom over to Linux about a year ago and I switched her over to Neon.

559
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:26,240
She has it hooked up to an external TV in her family room and she uses it all the time.

560
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,920
She thinks it's actually a lot better.

561
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
She was on –

562
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,920
Oh, cool.

563
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
– elementary.

564
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,680
She was on elementary but then it was too simple.

565
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,880
So because she's used to Windows and it has more of that classic desktop feel, everything's

566
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,800
right where she likes to – or where she can find it.

567
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Yeah.

568
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,800
Producer Michael, you were going to jump in there.

569
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
Go ahead.

570
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Oh, yeah.

571
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,800
Sorry.

572
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:51,040
I was just going to say that KDE's approach to the whole framework and Plasma itself is

573
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,960
changing to a modular style so you don't need the whole stack of KDE in order to use

574
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
certain pieces of it.

575
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,260
So a lot of it's being – like you'll need KWin for Plasma.

576
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,360
You kind of need that.

577
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,680
But the individual apps are no longer needing the full stack to install them.

578
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,680
Yeah.

579
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:13,160
So I think you have – for me on Arch, I have sort of – I've done like a minimal

580
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,640
or smaller Plasma desktop install which I think is sort of kind of what you're talking

581
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,640
about.

582
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
Like I didn't have to install all of it.

583
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,640
Right.

584
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,520
And then when I did Neon, it was – I wouldn't say it was minimal but it was refined.

585
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,880
And one of the other things I really, really appreciate about 5.9 is I'm not spending

586
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,360
all of my time tweaking it anymore.

587
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,440
With past Plasma desktops, especially earlier in the 5 series, I spent a lot of my time

588
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:42,760
screwing around with Plasma plasmoids and just dorking around with settings, trying

589
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,520
to see if I could create a Unity style desktop or a GNOME style desktop.

590
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:52,780
And now I'm just basically using mostly defaults, Kabla, Miner, took 10 minutes to

591
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,160
tweak a few things and I've just left it which is not something I've been able to

592
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,040
successfully do in the past with Plasma desktop.

593
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,120
It would irritate me too much.

594
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:05,400
But now the defaults are really working for me and it's meant that I just get right

595
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,400
to work.

596
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
That's awesome.

597
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,480
There's also another benefit to it, like a lot of people are annoyed when an update

598
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,120
happens and it breaks some of their stuff.

599
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,560
KD does not do that.

600
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:20,040
I've had the same configuration since 5.6.

601
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
I have had an update.

602
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,400
I've had something happen with my config, it went all bad and I had to trash it once

603
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,640
but it was so long ago I can't remember anymore.

604
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,880
Well, I mean it since like I create the settings for the applications and the layouts in my

605
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,600
panels however I want them and then I just save the config files for those and then whenever

606
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,440
I make a new, even if I build my system, maybe I can just drop them in and it's all back

607
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,760
to normal where I wanted it.

608
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
I like that.

609
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,180
And it's actually been 5.5 since I've had the same thing.

610
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,720
So it's like, it's just, it's a lot more seamless when you transition from one version

611
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,440
to the other, especially when even in like an Arch update where if you have like a big

612
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,160
update for most DEs, you're kind of worried that something might break.

613
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,920
With KDE, it's very unlikely that it will break.

614
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
Huh.

615
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
Well, I'll see.

616
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,880
All right, MonkeyConf, you want to jump in, go ahead.

617
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,840
Yeah, just don't mess with transparency or you'll mess up your desktop.

618
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,840
Does it crash?

619
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,840
Why?

620
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
What do you say?

621
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,600
That's a call out to Rod and we were working, he was trying to show me how to do transparency

622
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,680
and within about 15 minutes I had to do a complete nuke.

623
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:29,280
I made a video that expresses it specifically that if you do certain things with the transparency

624
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,040
and you have certain settings, it can make it weird, but I also provided a warning, don't

625
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
do this.

626
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:41,200
And I pointed out that if you do certain things in KDE and KWin, it will go, hey, maybe don't

627
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
do that.

628
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,800
Did you actually drop that level of sugar to the Linux community?

629
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
Are you serious?

630
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,480
We're all going to do it.

631
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,580
My entire point is to say, hey, this is really cool.

632
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,200
You can do this, but you should know what you're doing before you do it because it could

633
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
be weird.

634
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,560
There isn't a feature in KWin where you can say, force this setting.

635
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:04,080
If you force this setting on all of the windows for all of the applications, you could globally

636
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,920
break your system in the visibility of things.

637
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,580
You should learn the KWin structure before you start messing with that.

638
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:17,400
So I made a video that walks people through how to do it more safely.

639
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,640
Good idea.

640
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,440
So that's what he's referring to.

641
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:28,240
It's not as bad as it seems, but if you jump all in with not knowing what you're doing,

642
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,320
it could be weird.

643
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,000
With great power.

644
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,800
So is there a Scrapjaw you want to jump in about OpenGL, it might fit with the KWin discussion?

645
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:44,160
Yeah, when I did the 5.9 update on my mom's computer, she has an older AMD graphics card

646
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,880
on there, and any time a window, it does that little transparent thing when they come up

647
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,860
and go away, it would flicker really bad.

648
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:57,140
So I went into the compositor to see, okay, maybe I can just turn off all of that stuff.

649
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,920
And I noticed that it had the option for OpenGL 2 and 3.

650
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,200
I moved it to 3, and it was fine.

651
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
Oh, good.

652
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,720
So just a little nugget there.

653
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,520
I have not really messed with KWin settings either this time around.

654
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,840
I attempted to go in there and take a look.

655
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,840
Are you installing right now?

656
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,840
Whoa, you've already got it loaded.

657
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,840
Done.

658
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,840
That was quick.

659
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,720
I mean, I did launch it from GDM, so maybe that's heresy, but it worked.

660
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,960
And we're doing that right now, too, upstairs, so.

661
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,240
Wow, so did you do the Plasma meta?

662
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
What did you do?

663
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
Just Plasma desktop?

664
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
I just did the Plasma group.

665
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
I just did Plasma.

666
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
Oh, okay, good.

667
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,240
Good.

668
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,240
Very good.

669
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
Very good.

670
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,880
So hey, we can chat about how it goes next week.

671
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,200
We'll be Plasma buddies next week.

672
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,560
So I want to shift gears and talk about something that runs on Linux that sounds like a Hollywood

673
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,560
trope.

674
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,080
It sounds like, in fact, this video sort of summarizes this old, old Hollywood trope.

675
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,080
You all know.

676
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,080
Whoa, hi there.

677
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,080
That's not the video.

678
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,080
Whoa.

679
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,080
That's a different video.

680
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,080
Bound chicken brown cow.

681
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,760
You all know this Hollywood trope where they've been able to see in the reflection of somebody's

682
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:05,240
eyeball the license plate of a car, or the typical zoom-in-in-hands BS stuff.

683
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,840
Well, it's no longer BS stuff.

684
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:18,440
Okay, now let's get a good look at you.

685
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,440
Hold it.

686
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,440
Run that back.

687
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,440
Wait a minute.

688
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
Go right.

689
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
There.

690
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
Freeze that.

691
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,440
Full screen.

692
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,440
Okay, freeze that.

693
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Tighten up on that wheel.

694
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Vector in on that guy by the back wheel.

695
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,160
Zoom in right here on this spot.

696
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,200
With the right equipment, the image could be enlarged and sharpened.

697
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,200
What's that?

698
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,760
Does it enhance my program?

699
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,320
Can you clear that up any?

700
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,880
I don't know.

701
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,080
Let's enhance it.

702
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,080
Enhance section A-6.

703
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,080
I enhanced the detail, and...

704
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,080
I think there's enough to enhance.

705
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,080
Release it to my screen.

706
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,880
I enhanced the reflection in her eye.

707
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,360
Let's run this through video enhancement.

708
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,360
Edgar, can you enhance this?

709
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,360
Hang on.

710
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,880
I've been working on this reflection.

711
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,880
Someone's reflection.

712
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,880
The reflection.

713
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
There's a reflection of the man's face.

714
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
The reflection.

715
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
There's a reflection.

716
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
Zoom in on the mirror.

717
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,880
You can see a reflection.

718
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
Can you enhance the image from here?

719
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,880
Can you enhance him right here?

720
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
Can you enhance it?

721
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,880
Can you enhance it?

722
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
Can we enhance this?

723
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
Can you enhance it?

724
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,880
Hold on a second.

725
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
I'll enhance.

726
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
Zoom in on the door.

727
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Times 10.

728
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,880
Zoom.

729
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
Move in.

730
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
More.

731
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
Wait.

732
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
Stop.

733
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
Stop.

734
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,880
Pause it.

735
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,880
Rotate us 75 degrees around the vertical, please.

736
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Stop.

737
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,760
And go back to the part about the door again.

738
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,360
Got an image enhancer that can bitmap?

739
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,440
Maybe we can use the Pradeep Sen method to see into the windows.

740
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,000
This software is state of the art.

741
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
The eigenvalue is off with the right combination of algorithms.

742
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,640
He's taken elimination algorithms to the next level, and I can use them to enhance this

743
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,640
photograph.

744
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,640
Lock on and enlarge the Z-axis.

745
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,640
Enhance.

746
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,640
Enhance.

747
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,640
Freeze and enhance.

748
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,640
Freeze and enhance.

749
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:53,840
Yeah, so, pretty much the biggest trope ever in Hollywood and, of course, the cop drama

750
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,840
shows.

751
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,920
And Google's making it a reality.

752
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:01,040
It's called the super resolution Google Brain, and Google Brain has devised some new software

753
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,200
that can create detailed images from tiny pixelated source images.

754
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,880
Google software, in short, basically means zoom in, now enhance is possible.

755
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,640
The first part, the conditioning network, tries to map the 8x8 source image against other

756
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,400
high resolution images.

757
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,320
It downsizes other high resolution images to 8x8 and then tries to make a match.

758
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,400
And they have some examples here.

759
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,880
Then the second part, the prior network uses an implementation of pixel CNN to try and

760
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,120
add realistic high resolution details to the 8x8 source image.

761
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:36,960
Basically the prior network ingests a large number of high res real images of celebrities

762
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,280
in bedrooms, in this case, to match, I guess.

763
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,320
Then when the source image is upscaled, it tries to add new pixels that match what it

764
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,480
knows about the class of image.

765
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,960
To create the final super resolution image, the output from the two neural networks are

766
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,560
then mashed together and the end result usually contains a plausible addition of new details.

767
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,260
Google's Brain super resolution technique was reasonably successful in real world testing.

768
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,880
Now this is going to raise interesting questions and that's why I really hope things like this

769
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,240
are open source because think about this, it's not getting the real image, it's adding

770
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,560
details which are literally called hallucinations in image processing jargon.

771
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,080
They're best guesses, nothing more.

772
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,200
This raises some intriguing issues, especially in the realm of surveillance and forensics.

773
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,720
This technique could take a blurry image of a suspect, add more detail, you zoom and enhance,

774
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,760
but it wouldn't actually be a real photo of the suspect.

775
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,440
Why, that looks like you, Chris.

776
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,440
Right.

777
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,720
Yeah, that is a little disconcerting.

778
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,480
So, for some things it seems possible, but for that exact use case, it's like, no, this

779
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,000
is not the technology that we want.

780
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I agree.

781
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,480
It seems like you would really want, and if you do start to, if this thing would start

782
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,640
to ever end up in like law enforcement, you might want it to be open source.

783
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,640
Oh, yes.

784
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,640
Oh, get out.

785
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,640
Can you imagine that?

786
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,440
Like you're convicted of a crime that you were...

787
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,760
Not actually at the crime scene.

788
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,440
And some software gets to make up the image, you know.

789
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,920
Google at that at this point.

790
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,920
Oh, man.

791
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,960
That's just a scary one.

792
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,960
That is your scary story of the day.

793
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,960
Yeah.

794
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,960
That is pretty freaky.

795
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,960
All right.

796
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,960
Yeah.

797
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,760
Well, obviously, Scrapjaw asks if it would be admissible in court.

798
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,760
No, not now.

799
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,760
This is a future thing.

800
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
Go ahead.

801
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,400
Well, this is the reason I want this to become like a mainstream thing that everybody uses,

802
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
right?

803
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,320
That it gets dismissed as something that can be used in court.

804
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,240
It's something only accessible to some people, then yes, it will be admissible to court because

805
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,600
they will say, well, the software's not really that admissible.

806
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,160
It's only used in this kind of scenarios.

807
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,360
We're taking all precaution about it.

808
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:42,000
If it's in the masses and anybody could fake an image, everybody will be easily contesting

809
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,680
it as validity for evidence, and then it will be much easier to actually dismiss it as not

810
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,680
valid evidence.

811
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,680
Yeah.

812
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,680
Yeah.

813
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,720
I wonder if it would be treated like the polygraph because I've heard a lot of people say the

814
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,720
polygraph is crap.

815
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,080
I don't know if that's true or not.

816
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,080
I mean, who knows?

817
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,080
I don't know.

818
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,760
I've never taken a polygraph, so I can't say.

819
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,480
Polygraphs have taken the polygraph before.

820
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,760
It is good to give you an indication.

821
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:10,600
Now, if the individual is already aware and has done it before multiple times, the more

822
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:15,880
you do it, the less intense is the fact that you're doing the test, the less it actually

823
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,880
can detect.

824
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:21,200
It requires also an expert examiner to actually look at the results of the polygraph, which

825
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,240
is another issue as well.

826
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,680
So you have to see this individual.

827
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,680
It doesn't work at all.

828
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:34,080
It doesn't work because it shows someone's anxiety, their blood pressure, it doesn't

829
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,080
show whether they're lying.

830
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Yeah.

831
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:41,200
If you are super chill, then no matter what you say, it will just say that you're chill.

832
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,840
So that's the other thing, though.

833
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:49,280
However, we have subtle changes that this was supposed to detect, and this is why it

834
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,920
also requires an expert examiner to be able to know those subtle changes.

835
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:59,600
Also, it has to do with the timing, and it has to have precise timing on answer to response

836
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
of the polygraph examination.

837
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,460
There's been decades of research proving that it doesn't work.

838
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,880
So we should pick this up in the post-show, but I think MiniMech points out, going back

839
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,760
to the Google brain thing, MiniMech, you have a great point of why perhaps Google would

840
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,920
want long-term to be in the Google Photos game.

841
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,400
I mean, yeah, you have a huge photo base.

842
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,200
You have all the Android devices that are storing their photos on the cloud.

843
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,640
So you have that Google brain just measure the physiognomy of your face.

844
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,600
And so that would be a good base to recognize future criminals or everything.

845
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Oh, let me go check my upload status real quick.

846
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
Yeah.

847
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,600
Yikes!

848
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,600
That's a...

849
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
Oh, okay.

850
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
All right.

851
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
So let's move on.

852
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
We can pick up the...

853
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:45,560
I wouldn't mind picking up the whole discussion about the lie detector.

854
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,560
Yeah, absolutely.

855
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,560
Because I'm always fascinated by that.

856
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,560
Now, last gripping note, it could also be useful as terms of saving bandwidth and space.

857
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,880
So if you can recreate the image with some base, a smaller image that you're storing,

858
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,880
that could be beneficial.

859
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,960
What about also partial file recovery?

860
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,760
Maybe you recover an image file.

861
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:10,240
I had recently, I formatted an SD card accidentally and lost a day's worth of footage and tried

862
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,240
to do file recovery, but essentially managing the files back, but they were messed up.

863
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,800
So you're kind of like, you're working on your essay, it gets corrupted, then it restores

864
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,440
again, well, it's like, it's probably an okay essay.

865
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,320
This would be great if it could work for text.

866
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
Yeah.

867
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,920
Oh, man, journalism is never going to be the same.

868
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
All right.

869
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,600
Well, before we go any further, let's take a moment and I wanted to mention Linux Academy.

870
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:36,840
Go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged to learn more about their platform with step

871

It comes with your own server.

873
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,920
They spin them up on demand when you need them and you can SSH in.

874
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,960
They've also got a new web console you can check out.

875
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,240
If you go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged, you can sign up for a free seven day trial.

876
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,040
Get in there, try out the different courses, keep track of your progress, get a sense of

877
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,560
what it's like to work in the labs, maybe try out the instructor mentor where you get

878
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,640
full time human instructors that are happy to help a community stacked full of Jupiter

879
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,200
broadcasting members, comprehensive downloadable study guides you can take with you.

880
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,240

893
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,240
Linux ecosystem.

894
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,240
You should too.

895
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,360
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

896
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:15,880
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

897
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,280
Check it out and sign up for a free seven day trial.

898
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,200
Really quickly before we get into the thing that I really want to talk about this week,

899
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,680
there is an update for those of you out there running Windows 10 called the, I guess it's

900
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,240
called the anniversary update.

901
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,240
Is this what we do now?

902
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,240
We don't call it service pack one anymore?

903
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,000
It's an anniversary, Chris.

904
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,680
That's a much more special occasion.

905
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,400
It's not because there's a bunch of things that need to fix.

906
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:41,760
So there is, I guess, a bug that sort of screws you if you're running Ubuntu.

907
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:48,800
The Windows Update 10 anniversary bug updates Windows 10 and wipes out Ubuntu Linux partitions.

908
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,520
So I think what happened is, in this case, this guy was actually running Linux off of

909
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,200
a real partition, possibly.

910
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,000
I've never used this system, so I have no idea what I'm actually talking about when

911
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,960
it comes to running Linux on Windows, but based on his stack exchange, or I'm sorry,

912
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,480
askubuntu.com post, it looks like he was running it off of a real deal partition.

913
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,960
That's genuine Linux.

914
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,680
Yeah, and then this anniversary update just nuked it.

915
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,600
So if you're doing this, consider reading this post we have in the show notes.

916
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,800
We probably don't need to say more than that, right?

917
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,800
That's just kind of a...

918
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,800
I think that's it.

919
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,800
Yeah, that's kind of it.

920
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,640
I also noticed this week, before we go any further, it was an interesting week for...

921
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,120
Oh, well, oh, Scrapjaw, you had it happen to you.

922
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,120
Well then, tell us details.

923
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,120
Give us the deets.

924
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,240
Perhaps you can give us the 411 on the bug.

925
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,240
Scrapjaw?

926
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,560
Oh, sorry, Scrapjaw, I had you muted.

927
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,560
Start again.

928
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,560
That was my bad.

929
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,560
Yeah.

930
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:46,300
My wife uses it most of the time on Windows 10, so I don't normally mess with it.

931
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,920
So it did its little reboot thing, like it likes to do on its own, and then when it came

932
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,200
back up, it skipped the grub.

933
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,300
My grub was gone.

934
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,200
And then when I went in to try to find it, I was like, okay, I'll just put in the USB

935
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,280
boot and I'll redo grub, and then grub was like, hey, all I can see is Windows, there's

936
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,280
nothing else here.

937
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,880
And then it found out that it was a really hard process because my Linux was installed

938
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,640
in one of those extended partitions, because there's only one drive, and you can only have

939
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,920
so many primary partitions.

940
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,380
Right, right, because this is the Dark Ages, right.

941
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:26,080
So an extenuating process of going through live boots with Gparted and using some other

942
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:32,400
command line stuff, and eventually I ended up just having to rebuild the partition tables

943
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,760
where they were, and it was hard.

944
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,840
And I couldn't even begin to...

945
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:42,840
I put it somewhere where some other people had the problem, it's on a forum, I'll try

946
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,400
to dig up the link.

947
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,280
I did document it.

948
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,080
Microsoft loves Linux so much that they couldn't take the time to test this.

949
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,600
Ike, you said it also screws with UEFI?

950
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:56,400
Yeah, we've had a couple of people reporting now on the forums and on Reddit after they've

951
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,320
had the anniversary update.

952
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,960
Not only is the bootloader gone from the ESP, it's also taken out the EFI variables.

953
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,000
So even if they do restore the files, it doesn't matter if the variables have gone.

954
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:12,200
So for most of the people, they're not comfortable doing a true repair, so they're having to

955
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,740
do full reinstallations now because of it.

956
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,480
You know, I don't think Microsoft gets the idea what anniversaries are about.

957
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,480
They're a bad lover.

958
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,800
They do not get this.

959
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,800
They spend time together.

960
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,800
Yeah.

961
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,800
Happy anniversary.

962
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,800
Let me burn down the house.

963
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,800
Yeah.

964
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,800
God.

965
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,080
Before we go any further though, there was a lot of talk this week, surprise, get ready

966
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,840
for this guys, about containers.

967
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:35,640
But the reason why I wanted to mention it is because they're just on such opposite ends

968
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,080
of the spectrum that I just think it's adorable.

969
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:43,960
So this first article over at opensource.com is performance made easy with Linux containers

970
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,560
and goes into different ways to get response time under peak load down, ease of use, getting

971
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,400
it supportable, operational cost, figuring out your CPU needs.

972
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,360
It's a good article for people that are going to be deploying containers in production and

973
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,360
maybe have it.

974
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,360
Yeah, it's high level.

975
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,360
High level.

976
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:00,360
Yeah, it is.

977
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,240
Then there was another article, or actually done an article, it's a site they launched

978
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,720
that I like a lot, containerhardening.org, which is a project that focuses on hardening

979
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,740
Linux containers and is going to contribute patches to the kernel self-protection project.

980
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,520
And they say they're going to help try to benefit all container runtimes by keeping

981
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,560
the focus on improving the kernel and the subsystems used by the containers.

982
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,560
I like this.

983
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,560
I like that as well.

984
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,480
I think there's a lot of people that would argue that probably should have started with

985
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,480
security first.

986
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,480
Yeah, yeah.

987
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,480
And I'm not here to invalidate that.

988
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,240
But hey, this is going to be, if anything comes of it, it's going to be a lot better

989
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,240
than nothing.

990
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,240
Hey, Alan, could you let Wes back?

991
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,240
Yes.

992
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,240
There you go.

993
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,680
And then on the other end of the spectrum, Richard Brown, who hasn't been on the show

994
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,060
for a while but has been on the show in the past, had a talk at Fosdom who warned everybody

995
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:47,440
at Fosdom that containerized applications would be as bad as Windows applications with

996
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,840
DLL hell and everything is going to be ruined.

997
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,960
Containerized application technologies like AppImage, Snacky, and Flatback promise a brave

998
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,040
new world for Linux applications, free from the worries of shared libraries and dependency

999
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,160
issues.

1000
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,880
But there's just one problem.

1001
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,600
This is a road long traveled before, such as in the application dark ages of Win32 applications

1002
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,600
and DLLs.

1003
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,840
And it just worked out so wonderfully there.

1004
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,400
And I will link you to Richard's talk.

1005
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,280
You can listen to the whole thing.

1006
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,280
It's not long.

1007
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,680
It's just a great little talk if you want to catch it.

1008
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,680
Although, spoiler alert, I'm betting OpenSUSE of Build Service fixes everything.

1009
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,680
I bet it does.

1010
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:29,000
So you could probably just skip to the end there and probably just save yourself the

1011
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
long journey.

1012
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I find this whole thing of we now have this gray area of containers that are Docker images

1013
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
and LXD containers.

1014
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,960
And then we have people calling containers that are things like snap packages that install

1015
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:48,080
and cheroot themselves and have a mounted file system or Flatpaks that are kind of containers,

1016
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,720
but they're not really containers.

1017
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,440
This whole thing is like people have barely wrapped their head around it.

1018
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,500
It didn't mean anything before, and now it means even less.

1019
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,040
That's what I'm trying to say.

1020
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,200
That's exactly what I'm trying to say, is it means even less, and now we're getting

1021
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,400
upset to here's how to optimize and make it better.

1022
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,920
And we're not even using the same shared language, which is really kind of odd in the Linux open

1023
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:21,480
source community where they start to have this weird hyperbole abstract language.

1024
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,920
Usually we're very technically focused.

1025
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,920
We call things...

1026
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,920
Maybe overly technical.

1027
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:32,280
I guess maybe what we should start doing is start using the very technical term for these

1028
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,280
things.

1029
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,160
If it's a container, if it's really more like a cheroot, call it a cheroot.

1030
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,980
And if it's more like just all the processes get tagged with a name, well then it's really

1031
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,040
using namespaces.

1032
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,280
It's not really a container.

1033
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,600
Let's start using very specific language here because everybody's telling me all different

1034
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,600
things.

1035
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,820
It's going to solve all of our problems.

1036
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:57,760
It's going to be the only way to scale, or it's going to be win 32 hell.

1037
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,760
It's just a mess.

1038
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,880
It's just a hot mess this week, and I'll link to it all if you want to indulge.

1039
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,960
In the meantime, let's talk about lots of different options, from containers to just

1040
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,000
running it right up on their systems, digitalocean.com.

1041
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,840
Use our promo code over at DigitalOcean to get a $10 credit, SnapOcean.

1042
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,400
It's one word, SnapOcean.

1043
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,600
What?

1044
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,600
That's your promo code.

1045
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,920
I think I'm thinking about TechSnap.

1046
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,360
Did you know, by the way, SnapOcean?

1047
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:22,800
TechSnap, SnapOcean, coming up just a little bit after this show.

1048
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,800
That's right, it is.

1049
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,800
It is coming up a little bit after this show.

1050
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,800
Actually, you could use it.

1051
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,880
The thing about DigitalOcean is they're so great, there's just a ton of promo codes.

1052
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,000
I guess you could use SnapOcean for this week, and then next week-

1053
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Next week.

1054
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,240
If you haven't signed up yet, sign up and then use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1055
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,240
One word, lowercase.

1056
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,240
But maybe this week.

1057
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,240
How about Wes?

1058
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,800
If you're going to spin up a rig this week, SnapOcean.

1059
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:45,580
Create the account, you go over there, you sign up, you create the account, then once

1060
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:50,640
your account's ready, you apply that SnapOcean, or DOUNPLUGGED, to your account, and you get

1061
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,640
the $10 credit.

1062
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,760
Now, they got a $5 a month rig, they also have hourly pricing, so this is a great way

1063
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,680
to experiment with different projects, try different services, or really build back an

1064
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,260
infrastructure that works for you.

1065
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,880
Or just on-demand scaling, too, which is made even easier with a really straightforward

1066
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:07,320
API and very, very, very intuitive control panel.

1067
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,680
They also have an HTML5 console that goes from post all the way up to login, which gives

1068
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,040
you a lot of options.

1069
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,580
They make it easy to integrate teams and add multiple SSH keys and set up the DNS and deploy

1070
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:21,000
multiple rigs at once and take snapshots and revert.

1071
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:27,000
There's so many great community-contributed articles, like I was just looking at one before

1072
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,960
the show, how to set up an Apache virtual host on Debian 8, submitted 23 hours ago.

1073
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,560
Really well-structured guide.

1074
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,120
Not really DigitalOcean-specific, either.

1075
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:39,520
I tried to pick out some of the ones that anybody can use.

1076
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:44,320
If you're foolish enough to use another cloud provider, maybe you still have a dedicated

1077
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:49,760
box somewhere and you haven't gotten on to the revolutions, but hey, those docs are still

1078
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,760
worth a lot.

1079
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,760
Yeah, they are.

1080
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,760
They're so nice.

1081
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,720
There's also complete application stacks ready to go if you want to just deploy those, but

1082
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,720
check it out.

1083
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,280
Go to techsnap.com and help out the new TechSnap program by using the promo code SNAPOCEAN

1084
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:05,280
this week, or keep this show going by using the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1085
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,080
Well, you will get helped out either way.

1086
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:08,080
I know.

1087
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,160
Look at you with the double Tuesday Wes.

1088
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,880
It's a good time to show up live on the show.

1089
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,880
Yes, it is.

1090
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,280
Because you get here, you get to hang out with Unplugged, you can join us in the mumble

1091
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,080
room if you want, and then you wind down with a little Wes and Dan doing TechSnap.

1092
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,080
It's nice.

1093
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,080
That's what I do.

1094
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,080
It's pretty much what I do.

1095
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,600
So this came in from Vladimir, I'm sorry, it's Vermeer.

1096
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,600
It's not Vladimir Putin.

1097
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,600
Vermeer?

1098
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,600
Vladimir Putin?

1099
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,480
It came in to the show, Noah is right, which is always a good way to get my attention.

1100
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,480
Yep.

1101
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,480
And probably Noah's attention too.

1102
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,480
How could you not buy it at that?

1103
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:44,100
Solus will always be a boutique distro, and there is such a thing as finished software.

1104
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:48,660
So he says, I have this laptop, I take it to meetings on site, he says, I tried out

1105
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:53,960
Solus after all the talk on last, because you guys have been going on and on about it,

1106
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,920
and the first thing I thought was, this is pretty good.

1107
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,280
There are packages for Sublime Text, Volde, Steam, and loads of other software that had

1108
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,740
prevented me from taking it seriously in the past.

1109
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:07,160
For the first day, I thought it might be usable for a work distribution.

1110
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:11,000
I even considered installing it at home until I realized there was exactly zero amateur

1111
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,160
radio packages in the repo.

1112
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,000
Then on Thursday, I needed to do real work.

1113
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,240
My preferred serial terminal emulator is Minicom.

1114
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,240
Now guess what?

1115
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,760
Minicom, long story short, not in the repo, so I open up a bug report for your software

1116
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,760
request for Minicom.

1117
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:29,000
It was promptly closed, because I didn't follow the guidelines for the request exactly.

1118
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
My bad.

1119
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,840
I reopened the bug with the required information, built the package for myself, and included

1120
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,200
the patch, hoping this would help with inclusion.

1121
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,040
A few hours later, another user posted to the bug asking why I wouldn't use Bicocom,

1122
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,200
which also isn't packaged.

1123
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:48,160
He says, this morning, the bug was closed with the reason it hasn't been released since

1124
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,760
2013, clearly not maintained, thus not eligible for inclusion.

1125
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,320
Well, for F's sake, is it possible for software to be finished and stable?

1126
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,640
A program for emulating serial terminals has essentially zero attack service, and the protocol

1127
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,880
hasn't changed since the 90s.

1128
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,440
The current release has dependencies on bash and end cursors, and builds fine against the

1129
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,440
latest versions.

1130
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,760
I was planning on submitting some amateur radio packages so I could use Solus on my

1131
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,000
main PC at home, but after this point, I've completely given up.

1132
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,440
There's tons of good amateur radio software that will never be allowed in the repos, because,

1133
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,280
like Minicom, it's feature complete, finished, and stable.

1134
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,320
So instead of wasting energy trying to help, I'm uninstalling.

1135
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:31,400
And then people in the comments timed in, I don't understand the current last obsession

1136
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,640
over Solus.

1137
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,840
It seems to be just because the developer repairs regularly on Linux unplugged.

1138
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,280
I just can't see smaller distributions having the manpower to provide the same long-term

1139
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:47,440
support, software availability, or quality assurance testing as larger distributions.

1140
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,600
So I thought this summed up what probably a lot of people are thinking.

1141
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,520
Why do we talk about it?

1142
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,040
Is finished software such a thing, and why be so strict about how things get included

1143
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,680
in a distribution?

1144
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:05,860
And also, I'd like to talk about the over and over thing, and the reoccurring thing

1145
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,800
that I think we've talked about on the show in the past.

1146
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,840
People when they get into a new project, they sometimes end up at the bug tracker, submit

1147
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:18,040
a bug, and get shut down, and then they rage quit all over the internet about it because

1148
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:22,480
they've been personally violated, their ego has been bruised, and they must take to the

1149
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:28,080
internet and decry this great wrong that has happened to them because they went through

1150
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,360
the official process and the bug tracker did them wrong.

1151
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,840
This is also something that happens in open source a lot.

1152
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:38,420
So there's a lot to sort of chunk up here, and the first thing I want to start with before

1153
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:45,880
we get into all of it is why I think, for me personally, why I think Solus has a lot

1154
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:51,200
of potential over other more, we'll go with his word, boutique distributions.

1155
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,200
Distributions that have a handful of people to one person running them.

1156
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,680
I think a lot of it comes down to some of the same reasons I think Ubuntu Mate has done

1157
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:04,600
so well is because people at the top of the project in both these cases seem to really

1158
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,920
have their head on straight about certain things.

1159
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:12,560
Sometimes they will take a strong stance on something that seems perhaps like a bad choice

1160
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:15,980
and in the long term be proved it was a right choice.

1161
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:21,480
Sometimes they'll be working on something that was one or two years ahead of other distributions.

1162
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,980
In other cases, they're willing to solve problems that the other distributions just seem to

1163
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,400
stop at.

1164
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:32,540
For example, Solus with the Steam integration or Wimpy with the Ubuntu Mate tweak that makes

1165
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:38,240
it very simple to recreate experiences and turn on desktop effects in a way that were

1166
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,680
almost accomplished in the past but then he really brought it all done with the software,

1167
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:49,820
with his, what is he called, the welcome software selector that really kind of, here's how you

1168
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:53,560
configure your look and here's how you get started on your software and it was like wow,

1169
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,480
how come this was the final 10% that nobody else had done?

1170
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,120
There's so many things like that in Solus too and so I think a big part of looking at

1171
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,280
a distribution and how long they're going to be around is what's the leadership look

1172
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,680
like and I think the leadership plays a key role in just like any other factors, user

1173
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,960
base, software that their platform they're adopting, momentum, direction, all these things

1174
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,520
are important factors and I think Solus along with other distributions that I've mentioned

1175
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:21,440
recently have a unique mix of something interesting going on here.

1176
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,200
KDE Neon is another example of this, Ubuntu Mate like I just mentioned, the elementary

1177
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,980
project is another example of this, smaller distributions in their own right but doing

1178
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:33,080
something that the larger distributions are not doing.

1179
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:38,880
Now as to why I talk about it so much because this is a show for enthusiasts and I am an

1180
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,720
enthusiast, I could sit here and do a show about Red Hat 6 but no one would listen to

1181
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:45,720
it.

1182
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,400
I do shows about things that people that follow Linux are interested in, it's a pretty simple

1183
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,860
formula, I've been doing it for a long time, it's the same thing and people in this thread

1184
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:56,800
are going after me for saying, oh Chris is always following the new Shiny.

1185
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,440
We report on the new shit, that's what we do here.

1186
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,680
We talk about this stuff because we're interested in it and you're likely listening to a weekly

1187
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,280
Linux podcast because you're interested in things in Linux, you're an enthusiast.

1188
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,880
So we talk about those things.

1189
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,160
It does sometimes mean maybe we talk more about Solus than I talk about Debian, although

1190
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:19,320
probably not much to be honest but it's close and that does happen.

1191
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:23,560
It also means there's times where we are talking about Debian or Fedora or Ubuntu or Susa or

1192
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,420
whatever.

1193
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:31,200
So that's my opening discussion and rationale but Aiki, I invited you to the show today

1194
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:35,540
because I wanted to kind of get your take on this, it's a boutique distribution, it's

1195
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:40,280
too small to be taken seriously stuff and also perhaps I went and filed a bug, didn't

1196
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,960
get the answer I want, now everything's ruined.

1197
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:48,360
This seems to be like a rinse repeat thing that I see over and over again on the internet

1198
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:51,080
and I'm wondering from where you're sitting in the district, if you see this kind of stuff,

1199
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,480
if you have thoughts on all this stuff, the floor is yours.

1200
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,680
Well I mean I have plenty of thoughts on this but let's start at the most basic level.

1201
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,580
Let's take the title into consideration.

1202
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:05,040
This is a bug report, rant, complaint, whatever it is, against Solus for being a boutique

1203
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:10,520
distribution and the argument here, the premise is it's a boutique distribution because it

1204
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,880
doesn't ship my niche software which isn't applicable to its market.

1205
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,200
So you've already started out in the wrong foot.

1206
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,040
So the bug report was done wrong first because we have over 600 bugs still open on the tracker

1207
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,200
but we're trying to be efficient.

1208
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,320
If something's wrong, it gets closed down.

1209
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,600
You come back with it.

1210
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,760
Now it's come back, it's something that hasn't been maintained since 2013.

1211
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,880
Instantly the defense is, well you know, it's finished, there's nothing wrong with it.

1212
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:37,200
So I'm actually going to give you a link here right now on IRC because I have looked into

1213
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:38,200
it.

1214
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:42,240
Now in the past, this package has had two CVEs, it's got over 17 bugs that have been

1215
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,280
in the distribution and for the most part it's been good because nobody's looking.

1216
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,280
I've looked.

1217
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,560
That's a good point, that is a really good point.

1218
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:59,560
And also I would also point out that there's the other way you could interpret this was

1219
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:04,520
fast and concise communication from the development team because you guys responded pretty quickly

1220
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,660
and were clear as to why it wasn't included.

1221
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:11,000
There's no mystery, it's not like it gets left as an unanswered thing.

1222
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,600
Alright yeah here it is, yeah I see.

1223
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,520
Yeah and I've only had a very very brief look at it.

1224
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:21,960
There was a reason why we have things to be maintained because while it might not have

1225
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:27,240
a security bug now, the nature of security bugs is they happen after the fact.

1226
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,800
That is just how they happen.

1227
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:33,400
It could be something in a dependency that's changed, you know one part of the API it uses

1228
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,200
now behaves differently.

1229
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,860
If nobody else is maintaining it then you're taking on a responsibility that in a year

1230
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,960
or two years from now you're going to have a CVE.

1231
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,520
So you have to think in those terms.

1232
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:48,800
The concept of, so the core concept and I think what he finds to be frustrating is,

1233
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,040
and this is where he says NOAA is right, is that software can be 100% finished.

1234
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,040
Feature complete.

1235
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,040
NOAA uses Thunderbird.

1236
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,040
Clearly it's wrong.

1237
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,560
I tend to agree too because software does not stand alone.

1238
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:05,760
It is surrounded by a collection of libraries and processes that are all potentially vulnerable

1239
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,760
and the whole system, especially Linux, is constantly moving.

1240
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:15,040
And if your application stands still, eventually the platform underneath will just open up

1241
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:19,440
a vulnerability that you're susceptible to, let alone just incompatibility of any other

1242
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:20,440
kind.

1243
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,440
Right.

1244
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,440
Keeping up to date, compatible, yes.

1245
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,440
Right.

1246
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,860
And I mean there is another aspect to this as well.

1247
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:30,880
Now we've had people before, you know like the general policy is if it doesn't meet

1248
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,600
the policy to close it.

1249
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,000
If there is a problem with it, because it's a very generic policy, there might be some

1250
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,720
things that could skip through that policy, right?

1251
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,720
So if there is that case, then you raise it.

1252
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:47,120
You raise it through the appropriate channels, literally the IRC channels or you ping me.

1253
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,720
You know, you communicate with us.

1254
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,520
What you don't do is then go and act the bollocks and then throw a rant on Reddit just because

1255
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:53,920
you didn't get your way.

1256
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:59,800
Now if I'm going to work with people in Solace, I value one single quality above all else

1257
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:03,920
when it comes to working with other people and that is integrity.

1258
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,540
And it's clearly not demonstrated in this case.

1259
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,200
So I don't need to take the patch.

1260
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:12,960
Now what we can do, if they wanted to talk about reviewing the process, then yes we can

1261
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,960
do that.

1262
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,240
Unfortunately, we haven't had time to have that discussion.

1263
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:22,640
Now what we did to cover our own backsides basically said if it's not maintained anymore,

1264
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,520
we just can't afford to take that on because that's just shooting ourselves in the foot

1265
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,800
and asking for trouble down the road.

1266
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,760
Now what we can do to actually address this problem, now if he'd actually come to me

1267
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,800
and said look, we kind of need this thing and there is no alternatives, what can we

1268
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,800
do about it?

1269
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,800
Is there any way we can loosen the policy?

1270
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:43,280
I mean to be honest, it isn't – I mean so you can take argument with how he brought

1271
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:49,640
up the issue but Vermeer's primary issue here is probably on a grander scale, something

1272
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,820
you're going to face consistently.

1273
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:53,760
Everybody has their esoteric thing that they want installed.

1274
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,200
I mean this is the thing.

1275
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,760
So you get people come along, right?

1276
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,680
They've been with it for all of two seconds.

1277
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,640
They assume it needs to be exactly what they say it is.

1278
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:07,300
They ignore what the project actually is and because it doesn't do exactly what they

1279
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,300
have to do.

1280
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:11,920
Like we've had it before, like oh, how dare you not have server software.

1281
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,200
How do you think you're going to get anywhere in the market when you don't cater to servers?

1282
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,000
It's for desktops you jackass.

1283
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Yeah.

1284
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,600
Although I did come as like wait a minute, SabNZB isn't available?

1285
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:23,600
This is crazy.

1286
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,600
Oh right, it's for desktops.

1287
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:30,440
But in this particular case, we have a bit of software which is from what I can now understand

1288
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:34,880
having looked at it afterwards, it is the only thing that does what this particular

1289
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,640
guy needs to do, right?

1290
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:42,080
So fine, we have a review processes and we say, all right, so our policy at the moment

1291
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:43,080
is far too anal.

1292
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,040
We know that and we're honest about that, right?

1293
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,000
But what you do is you talked about this.

1294
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:53,920
Now, what my proposal would be to do there is we say, okay, if we can't use the age rule,

1295
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:58,120
which obviously is a very loose rule, it doesn't always work, then what we can say, if it exists

1296
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:03,580
in free of remain stream distributions, excluding Arch, I'm sorry, but if it exists in Ubuntu

1297
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:09,160
and or Debian, Fedora and openSUSE, then we could just skip that rule because we're then

1298
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,320
sharing the weight among all the distributions.

1299
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:16,360
That's something I would have been willing to discuss with this person, but then just

1300
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:21,280
to go up on Reddit because you've used it for a day, you didn't get your own way and

1301
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,960
then you go scream to the whole internet, I don't want to work with you now.

1302
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,560
We're looking for community maintainers, people to come on board, people who will engage in

1303
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:33,480
a responsible way and demonstrate integrity, a relationship of trust, then we'll onboard

1304
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,360
you and we'd love to work with you.

1305
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:38,020
If you're going to go there and you're going to throw your toys out with a pram, I've no

1306
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:43,440
interest in working with you at all because you're wasting my time and just stressing

1307
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,600
me out for absolutely no reason.

1308
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,480
I don't need to work with people like that.

1309
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:52,120
Now, while I love contributions coming to Solus, that would have taken me all of 14

1310
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:53,540
seconds to package.

1311
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:59,060
I don't need it, but it does help us because those 14 seconds, they all add up, right?

1312
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:02,300
So we can keep adding more and we add value for people, but if you're trying to change

1313
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:06,260
what Solus is, I'm not going to allow you to do that by saying it's a niche when it's

1314
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:11,080
your niche that's not being met.

1315
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,520
You need to understand when you're looking at something, you understand what it is.

1316
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,500
I think that's a great point, is consider the audience.

1317
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:21,000
It's sort of the same problem that people have when they go use elementary OS.

1318
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,800
It's like a very technical user goes to use elementary OS that is expecting more like

1319
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,520
a plasma experience than they get elementary OS, which is much simpler and they think,

1320
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:33,080
this is a distribution for noobs and it's a boutique and it's no good and they denounce

1321
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:35,720
it online and it's just you're not the right audience for it.

1322
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:36,720
Right.

1323
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,720
It's kind of like an interview, right?

1324
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:42,360
Like where it's a fit for both of you and we're not like by talking about Solus or not,

1325
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:45,120
we're not trying to say Solus is the perfect thing for all of your things, right?

1326
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,620
We're saying for this use case, the things that we're using it for, we found it to be

1327
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,840
enjoyable and interesting and worthwhile to check out.

1328
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,840
Exactly.

1329
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,840
If it doesn't fit, then it doesn't fit.

1330
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:58,520
What we want to do in Solus now is we are aware that we have problems in the processes

1331
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:03,600
because they've existed since the beginning, you know, and Solus now is, you know, it's

1332
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,680
establishing itself.

1333
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:10,160
And as I say, we've got over 600 requests on it, 200 of those are package requests.

1334
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,740
So that's one third of the bugs we have are package requests.

1335
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:17,120
So clearly there is a problem with package availability, right?

1336
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,920
I'll hold my hands up to that.

1337
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,760
Solus doesn't have all the packages that everybody needs.

1338
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,080
We want to address that.

1339
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:27,180
So we want to get people on board who can identify these things, but again, can look

1340
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:31,280
at Solus for what it is and say, okay, does this thing really apply to Solus?

1341
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,280
And you know, we can change the process.

1342
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,940
So it's not just, well, this thing hasn't seen a release since 2013.

1343
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,320
Is it in free or distro?

1344
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,320
Yes.

1345
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,320
Can we distribute it?

1346
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,320
Yes.

1347
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:43,440
Is there 84 other things doing the same thing?

1348
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,180
You know, so sensible rules.

1349
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,040
And then we can start to form a team.

1350
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,320
We'll give people get access.

1351
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:51,000
We'll give them publish access so they can get these things on.

1352
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,380
There is a right way to do things and a wrong way.

1353
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:58,240
The way that this reaction has gone on Reddit, they're just, it's the, it's the meme diff

1354
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,800
reaction that you get from people.

1355
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:01,660
So on this one, Solus has no packages.

1356
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,000
They're just a meme distro.

1357
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
They'll get nowhere.

1358
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,040
It's the same as when people rant about elementary OS, you know, they say they're only focused

1359
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:12,980
on design, but what they forget about elementary OS is they actually do focus on software.

1360
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:17,800
You know, if you look behind the scenes, you've got things like, um, wifi portal support.

1361
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,040
They've got their own firewall D front end.

1362
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:22,200
They have that whole, they have that whole templating system.

1363
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,480
We get it set up to create, uh, apps on the desktop environment.

1364
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,480
It's really well done.

1365
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,480
Right.

1366
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:31,320
So people ignore the actual reality of it when it doesn't suit their needs.

1367
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,200
I mean, that's what it comes down to, isn't it?

1368
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,200
Yeah.

1369
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:35,200
You know, you're angry with something.

1370
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,600
So you actually forget the reality of it.

1371
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,600
Yeah.

1372
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,600
Yeah.

1373
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,240
So I think you're saying Solus is only about design.

1374
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,040
Solus is only about design.

1375
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,760
And if it's not purple, I'm sorry, I'm not interested.

1376
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,720
Um, but yeah, I mean this, this thing on Reddit, I'm not annoyed at it.

1377
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,720
I'm not annoyed at him.

1378
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:51,720
Yeah.

1379
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:52,720
I'm kind of disappointed.

1380
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,720
I'm more disappointed with it.

1381
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,720
Yeah.

1382
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,840
So when these kind of feedback pieces come in, you know, I reason I want to cover it

1383
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,400
is Ramir is one case here, but really it's probably something that's been a lot, you

1384
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:06,080
know, you read the rest of the comments, uh, people had go as far as to say that I am damaging

1385
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:11,120
Linux because we're a, we're a large channel that is actively guiding less informed people

1386
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,880
to a niche within a niche.

1387
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,520
And so we are going to cause Linux desktop usage to implode.

1388
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,520
Yeah.

1389
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:22,080
Because we know the inverse to be true because what they're actually doing is stifling innovation

1390
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:26,000
and freedom by forcing people onto the establishment.

1391
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,880
So this is where it does feel a little anti-change, a little, a little a pro establishment, a

1392
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,920
little like why do something different is that there is an element of that.

1393
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:35,920
Yeah.

1394
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,560
I mean the, the, the words you always hear out of people's mouth is why are you reinventing

1395
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,560
the wheel?

1396
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,320
And it never has anything to do with the wheel.

1397
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,080
It's always the friction in the road.

1398
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:49,480
And unfortunately these people are part of that friction in the road.

1399
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:53,200
Maybe Jupiter Broadcasting needs Linux plugged in so that you can only talk about Red Hat,

1400
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,200
Ubuntu and SUSE.

1401
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,200
Yeah.

1402
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:59,160
What we'll do is we'll create an approved licensed Linux distributions that are, that

1403
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:05,240
are mainstream and that are a new approved only approved PR representatives from those

1404
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,000
enterprises here to talk.

1405
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,600
No more, no more Ikea.

1406
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,880
We all know how a monopolized industry with no competition.

1407
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,360
We all know how that goes.

1408
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,360
Right?

1409
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,360
Yeah.

1410
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,360
Right.

1411
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,560
I hope I don't mean to be, I don't mean to be come across as crass, but I was sort of,

1412
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:25,240
I was sort of shocked by the whole thread started three days ago because the, it just

1413
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:29,560
seemed, it seemed a little over the top because really I don't think we ever say drop what

1414
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,560
you're doing.

1415
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,760
And in fact, I mean on this network you've had shows like what's the best beginner distro.

1416
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,400
What's the best distro to introduce to your friends.

1417
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,400
Right.

1418
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,400
So yeah.

1419
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,400
Really have a different take on this.

1420
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,400
Okay.

1421
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,400
Go ahead.

1422
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:45,480
Yeah, I mean, I think with, with the first premise, which it can software be complete

1423
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:49,280
and people saying that now as a developer, when you're developing something, you have

1424
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,640
to set yourself a barrier boundary.

1425
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,360
Otherwise you will end your life and you're not going to finish it.

1426
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:57,280
So there is such feature complete.

1427
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:58,280
I agree.

1428
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,280
Yeah.

1429
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:00,280
Feature complete.

1430
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,280
Yep.

1431
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:04,660
And, and of course if the ecosystem around is changing, but it's intended to support

1432
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:09,560
applications on its top and now open the vulnerability, maybe the fault is that that system on the

1433
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,000
way that it changed.

1434
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,120
Maybe the system recognized that it's no longer important or crucial to maintain that up functioning

1435
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:21,240
of that application, which indeed needs to be considered by those that orchestrate the

1436
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,240
system.

1437
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,880
So in this case, it's on the responsibility of the maintainers of the distribution to

1438
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,960
decide they'd like to take that risk or not.

1439
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,840
I would say too, like in the case of mini-com, it has, it has very small set of dependencies

1440
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:35,240
like bash is really one of its major dependencies.

1441
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,240
But sure.

1442
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:41,480
They'll get into specifics of specific software cause that then it can be very different for

1443
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,840
each independent case.

1444
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:45,720
It needs to be evaluated by the core principles.

1445
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:49,460
Now it goes to the second factor that I like to point out, which is how people tend to

1446
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:50,960
choose distributions.

1447
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:56,480
I've stressed this in this show multiple times and I still think people don't get it.

1448
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,960
It's like stop choosing your distribution by the features or applications that come

1449
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:04,860
from installing on it and change and choose it based on principle.

1450
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:09,800
It's something that it says that I'm going to care for advanced users and I'm going to

1451
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,200
make my primary choices and target for that type of niche, then you're probably going

1452
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,800
to be better served there, so on and so forth.

1453
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,800
So that's actually-

1454
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:18,800
That's so boring.

1455
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:19,800
That's so boring.

1456
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:20,800
How do I distro hub?

1457
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,800
No, yeah.

1458
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:22,800
I think it's actually a good point.

1459
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,800
I have to disagree with part of that.

1460
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,240
Okay, go ahead.

1461
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,960
Once you've completed an application, right?

1462
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,960
So if I'm writing any software, you do have a roadmap, you know, you do have this architectural

1463
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,040
overview of what you're going to do, right?

1464
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:38,320
And yes, there is a point where you are, as you say, you are feature complete, but as

1465
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:43,200
a responsible developer, you still maintain it.

1466
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,200
It enters its twilight years.

1467
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,200
Right.

1468
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:50,320
Well, the fact is if you're going to have something around, you know, like that's not

1469
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,720
going to be maintained anymore, why would you take the risk in the first place?

1470
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:58,120
That's why I said if there's free over distributions that did have that, then sure, because then

1471
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,840
we're all sharing the burden, right?

1472
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,640
But if you've got to set a precedent somewhere, we can't just say, well, this thing, you know,

1473
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:06,640
we'll let this one in.

1474
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:12,080
But the other stuff of the exact same criteria, which also isn't maintained, isn't going in,

1475
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:16,640
you know, you can't do that.

1476
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,960
It's just bad form to take on abandoned software, full stop.

1477
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:24,880
It doesn't seem long term supportable, especially if you do have a smaller team, like you don't

1478
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,480
And we are a rolling release as well.

1479
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,680
It's not like we're a static release, the chances of those things breaking and falling

1480
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:34,800
apart is exponentially more dangerous than the static release because you can drop them

1481
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,960
between the releases.

1482
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,160
However, we've got to keep these things going on.

1483
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,960
So then we adopt technical debt.

1484
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,440
We've got to add that thing to our QA now.

1485
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:46,920
We've got to make sure this thing is working and we've got to keep this working over time.

1486
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:50,720
It's much harder to get rid of something from a rolling system than it is an over.

1487
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:53,880
And then you get to the point where you've gone from having, say, 5000 packages or so

1488
01:11:53,880 --> 01:12:00,680
like we have now, not 10, you know, to the point where you've then got 15, 20, 30,000

1489
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:04,280
packages and 40% of them are abandoned.

1490
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:12,560
And I wonder, too, if it was a popular open source project, maybe we could fantasize about

1491
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:19,000
a situation where somebody takes it on, fixes some of the bugs, maybe starts repackaging

1492
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,400
it and it gets brought back to life.

1493
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:24,880
Maybe you would hope that would happen, but I kind of have to fall down with Ikea on this.

1494
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:30,160
You could package it up and make it work for a while, but you pick up half a dozen of these

1495
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,640
and all of a sudden you've got yourself a nice string of technical debt that you have

1496
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:33,640
to...

1497
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,920
Especially if you're trying to have a standard for packages, you want your packages to work,

1498
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,600
you try to have QA and release cycles and continuous integration cycles where things

1499
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,400
build and if these things are suddenly going to start failing and you're going to have

1500
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:43,400
to investigate it.

1501
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:49,280
I agree that that's real work to take on and given your project doesn't make sense really.

1502
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,280
There is a solution.

1503
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:55,000
If you have little bits of software that they do love, all she would have to do is look

1504
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,520
at it one or two months, take over that project, offer to take it over, every one, two, maybe

1505
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:04,200
three months even, just have a look at it, make sure everything builds all right and

1506
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:06,360
then just bump a new tag.

1507
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:11,600
We need like an incubator where these projects can go, like one, like a real incubator.

1508
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,080
It's not run by Google or something.

1509
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,640
All packages go to heaven.

1510
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,640
Yeah.

1511
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:19,240
Or maybe it's more like Purgatory, I'm not sure, but...

1512
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:24,520
Then we can at least, our favorite things can get updated.

1513
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:30,640
In the meantime, I mean, I guess you could always set up a Docker container, put a Ubuntu

1514
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,480
environment in there and load Minicom in there, maybe.

1515
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,480
I don't know.

1516
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,480
That's impossible.

1517
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:40,160
No, I'll put Minicom in because it's the only one that does the thing and because at least

1518
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:44,760
free over distribution to have it and I'll make that a rule going forward and we could

1519
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:49,360
have saved ourselves all of this heartache, all of this pain by not going on and doing

1520
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:54,600
a big thing up on Reddit, just so everyone else sees how unhappy you are, it was no help

1521
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,600
to us.

1522
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,600
Yeah.

1523
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,600
It was absolutely no help to Solace at all because I've had to take time out of my, obviously

1524
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:04,040
I love coming on and seeing you guys, I'll make that one very clear now, because I've

1525
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,040
had to come on.

1526
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,040
Well, don't fucking come on then.

1527
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,040
Oops, sorry.

1528
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:13,040
But yeah, I've had to take time out of my schedule now to come and deal with a non-issue.

1529
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:19,920
Yeah, I think when people ask why Solace and I say the leadership, I think this conversation

1530
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,040
sort of underscores why I say that.

1531
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:28,000
So I think, hopefully, if you've been wondering why do they talk about Solace so much, maybe

1532
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,440
that sort of sheds a little light on it.

1533
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,520
And if not, maybe we'll get to hear more from you.

1534
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:33,520
Yeah.

1535
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,200
Anyway, thank you for coming on and setting us straight and it sounds like Mr. Vlamer

1536
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:43,320
there, Vermeer, could look forward to freaking MiniCom and Solace in the future.

1537
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,320
Yeah.

1538
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,320
There you go.

1539
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:46,320
Yay.

1540
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,320
Yeah.

1541
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,320
Yeah, everybody wins-ish.

1542
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:52,920
All right, well that right there brings us to the end of this week's Linux Unplugged.

1543
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,920
We're going to skedaddle so that way we can get out of here for the TechSnap guys, which

1544
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,560
are coming up in just a little bit.

1545
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:02,840
If you'd like to join us live and get even more show, go over to jblive.tv on a Tuesday.

1546
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:09,060
Get it converted to your local time zone at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1547
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:13,160
Go check out iKey if you want more iKey on late night Linux over there.

1548
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:14,160
And check out Wes.

1549
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:15,160
What's your Twitter handle, Wes?

1550
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:16,160
Where are people going to follow you?

1551
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:17,160
At Wes Payne.

1552
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,160
Magic.

1553
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,740
I'm at Chris LAS.

1554
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:23,840
You could give us your feedback or news ideas at linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1555
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:24,840
Thanks for being here.

1556
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:52,240
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1557
01:15:54,840 --> 01:16:17,680
All right, everybody.

1558
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:20,100
Thank you very much for being here.

1559
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:22,440
Everybody now, everybody now go to jbtitles.com.

1560
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:26,240
Just pick our title and let's get the studio ready for Wes.

1561
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:29,400
Alexa, turn on JB1.

1562
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:31,280
So now we'll get the lights warmed up for you.

1563
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:37,680
Oh, boy, that's quite a different environment in here.

1564
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:38,680
All right.

1565
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:39,680
Boy, sheesh.

1566
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,160
I didn't realize we were doing lup in a cave.

1567
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:42,160
I know.

1568
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,160
But I like that.

1569
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,160
I mean, it was a wonderful cave.

1570
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,160
It was.

1571
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:46,160
It was very warm.

1572
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,160
There was beer there.

1573
01:16:47,160 --> 01:16:48,160
Now I feel like we're on.

1574
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,160
Now we've got to be on.

1575
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:50,160
Hello, everybody.

1576
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,160
All right.

1577
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:52,160
Let's see here.

1578
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:55,760
Lup Enhanced is for jackasses, you desktop.

1579
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:57,600
It's for desktops, you jackass.

1580
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,320
What about instead of jackass, we did you jerk or something like that?

1581
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:01,320
Yeah.

1582
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,320
Something more palatable.

1583
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:04,000
Still going to piss somebody off.

1584
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,000
Yeah.

1585
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,040
Lup Enhanced is also pretty good.

1586
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,040
Oh, come on.

1587
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:14,920
While you guys vote, let's see if, Wes, you knew the five secret unity features that most

1588
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:16,920
people don't know.

1589
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:17,920
Number one.

1590
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,400
No, let's do it in reverse order.

1591
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,400
You ready to do it in reverse order?

1592
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,400
Yeah, let's do it.

1593
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:22,400
Number two.

1594
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:23,400
Number five.

1595
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,400
Number five.

1596
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:28,000
You can reveal all of the different key bindings for the Unity desktop by holding down their

1597
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
meta key.

1598
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Well, we all knew that.

1599
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Yeah, that one.

1600
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,920
I mean, I feel like that one, you just take a little too long doing anything, and you're

1601
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:34,920
like, oh, what if I stumble?

1602
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:35,920
All right.

1603
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:36,920
Number four.

1604
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:40,960
Using the super key to open the trash super plus T.

1605
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:42,120
I did not know that.

1606
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,120
I didn't.

1607
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,120
Let me try this on Gnome.

1608
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,120
Oh, that's nothing.

1609
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,120
Nothing.

1610
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,120
Okay, I didn't know that.

1611
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,800
You know how you could know that?

1612
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,960
From the quick list that it pops up with the super key.

1613
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:51,960
You don't even.

1614
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,080
You're about to ruin.

1615
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,080
Number three.

1616
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:56,960
Using the super key to launch specific lenses.

1617
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,520
Yeah, lenses are a thing.

1618
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,180
Super A is the app lens.

1619
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:01,740
Super F is the files lens.

1620
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:02,740
Super M is music.

1621
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:05,520
C is photos, and V is videos.

1622
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:10,520
And then number two, which rotten totally just spoiled.

1623
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,200
You can figure out, oh, wait, no, it was this?

1624
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:14,920
Oh, yeah, because it would show you trash.

1625
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:15,920
That was the first one you pointed out.

1626
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:16,920
Yeah, yeah.

1627
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,760
You can launch a program on the launcher, but with the super key.

1628
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:24,520
So super key, and then one through the series of one through nine, and the different icon

1629
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:25,520
positions.

1630
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:29,160
So like number one is files, and this two is Firefox, and you did super key two to launch

1631
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:30,280
Firefox.

1632
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,280
That's actually legit.

1633
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:32,280
Yeah.

1634
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:33,280
That's not bad.

1635
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,280
I'd like that.

1636
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:35,280
I'd like that.

1637
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,760
So if I'm on plasma for a week, maybe you should install Unity on there.

1638
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:37,760
Don't even.

1639
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,520
And then HUD, which is number one, which everybody knows about.

1640
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:45,200
Pressing the Alt key while using any program, Unity reveals a type your command window,

1641
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,760
which is actually kind of a neat feature.

1642
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:47,760
Yeah.

1643
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,960
Where did our title shake out while we did that?

1644
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,320
All right, guys, we're checking in on your work.

1645
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,320
Yay, the titles.

1646
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,320
Oh, really?

1647
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,320
What is it?

1648
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,320
This is the quiz we mentioned.

1649
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,320
Popey says he has one.

1650
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,320
We don't know.

1651
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:01,080
Ladies and gentlemen.

1652
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:02,080
What is it?

1653
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,840
Come on, Popey.

1654
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:13,720
What is it?

1655
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,880
Shift print screen.

1656
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:21,080
That takes a screenshot of your window, specifically.

1657
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,080
All right.

1658
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:23,080
All right.

1659
01:19:23,080 --> 01:19:24,080
There you go.

1660
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,080
Shift print screen, everybody.

1661
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,080
There you go.

1662
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,080
Nice, Popey.

1663
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,080
Nice.

1664
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,080
Crypton infusion.

1665
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,080
Controls print screen is the window.

1666
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,080
That's a region.

1667
01:19:31,080 --> 01:19:32,080
Yeah.

1668
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,080
How about it's for desktops, jerks?

1669
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,880
No, see, but then that guy's going to think we're calling him a jerk in the title.

1670
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:35,880
Right.

1671
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:36,880
When it wasn't actually aimed at him.

1672
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:37,880
Yeah.

1673
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:38,880
It was a previous book.

1674
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:39,880
Yeah.

1675
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:40,880
Yeah.

1676
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:41,880
So that's the only thing about that.

1677
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,880
That's the only thing about that.

1678
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:47,880
Oh, so I have to say one thing to keep Popey happy otherwise he's not going to let it go.

1679
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:52,880
So it's an operating system, not a distro.

1680
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:53,880
There you go.

1681
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,560
Oh, is this a thing of yours?

1682
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:56,560
You don't call it a distro?

1683
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,560
Is that a...

1684
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:03,240
So my ambition is to build an operating system, not just another distro.

1685
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:06,000
Not just a distro, but the whole operating system.

1686
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,600
So apparently I have to say potatoes.

1687
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,600
Oh, you...

1688
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,600
God damn it.

1689
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,600
No.

1690
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,600
I just realized what you've done to me.

1691
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,320
I love it.

1692
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,720
This is why you probably tuned in.

1693
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:18,720
That's amazing.

1694
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:20,720
This is literally why Popey tuned in probably.

1695
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:21,720
Oh.

1696
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:24,680
Or as we say here, spuds.

1697
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:25,680
Spuds.

1698
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,680
Spuds.

1699
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:29,680
With a H.

1700
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,160
Happy football day everybody, by the way.

1701
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,160
It was football here in the United States.

1702
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,160
Football.

1703
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:35,160
Sports.

1704
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,160
Yeah, sports ball.

1705
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:37,160
Sports ball.

1706
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,160
All right.

1707
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,120
So I don't know if we should go with it's for desktops, jerk, because it's for...

1708
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,040
I know.

1709
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,640
My Linux is not your Linux.

1710
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:46,120
It's a little abrasive, so we can't do that.

1711
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:48,840
Enthusiastically enhanced.

1712
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,800
Quantum of Solace played again.

1713
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,280
Solace is your grandpa's Linux.

1714
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:56,040
We're going to have to switch over for a tech snap here in a moment.

1715
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,360
It won't be that rough.

1716
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,400
We won't have to restart the stream or anything.

1717
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,240
There may be a standby screen for a moment or two, but...

1718
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:03,240
Just do what it says.

1719
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:04,240
Standby.

1720
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:05,240
That's right.

1721
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,240
That's all you got to do is just standby.

1722
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:07,240
It's really easy.

1723
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,240
You can even sit by if you'd like.

1724
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,880
Standby, Wes.

1725
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:12,880
Linux nose-plugged.

1726
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,680
Ah, I get it.

1727
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:19,040
Windows 10 anniversary surprise.

1728
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,040
That's true.

1729
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:21,040
That's good, too.

1730
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,040
It's just so long.

1731
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:26,120
I just realized I forgot to comment on the fact that you said that Gedi seemed more responsive

1732
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:29,160
and I was like, oh, that's a myth.

1733
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,160
What's that?

1734
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,160
Oh, yeah.

1735
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:32,160
Boutique.

1736
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,480
Oh, that was my idea of a boutique distro myth.

1737
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,480
Was something like that.

1738
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,480
Something like that was my title.

1739
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,120
It was what I was thinking in the back of my head, but I forgot to suggest it.

1740
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,120
Boutique.

1741
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:41,600
You know the funny part there when he was asking about what a buntumate's thing is called?

1742
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,600
It's the software boutique.

1743
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:43,600
Yeah.

1744
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:44,600
I thought so.

1745
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,600
Yes.

1746
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,600
That's right.

1747
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,600
I thought so, but then we were saying boutique so much.

1748
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:48,600
But that's just the software part.

1749
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:49,600
Yeah.

1750
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,600
I know.

1751
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:53,080
But we were saying it so much that I was like, shit, am I now mixing up my words or

1752
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,080
what?

1753
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,080
Boutique.

1754
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:56,080
The damn word.

1755
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,560
So boutique distro myth.

1756
01:21:58,560 --> 01:21:59,560
The myth.

1757
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:02,480
How about the myth of boutique distros or something like that?

1758
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:03,480
Is that good?

1759
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:04,480
It's not bad.

1760
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,480
Not bad.

1761
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:08,320
I feel like myths played out a lot, but that's fine.

1762
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,320
Yeah.

1763
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,000
That's the server distro myth.

1764
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:15,320
Busting the boutique mistrodith or something like that.

1765
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,320
I don't know.

1766
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:20,920
What do you... The WWE has submitted a boutique distro myth, but I feel like that's not quite

1767
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:24,840
... It feels a little clunky, although I like that it's only three words.

1768
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:25,840
And there are boutique distros.

1769
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:26,840
Yeah.

1770
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:27,840
Yeah, there are.

1771
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:28,840
It's true.

1772
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:29,840
Damn it, Ike.

1773
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:37,120
I feel like people don't take a pause to think about what they post before they post it.

1774
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,400
Well, they get upset, you know?

1775
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:42,480
Well, in that case, that dude had this huge rant, so he had to take a little bit of time

1776
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,480
to reread some stuff.

1777
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:44,480
Well, I mean, maybe he didn't read it.

1778
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,480
Maybe he just wrote it.

1779
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:46,480
The boutique battle.

1780
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:55,680
I wish it would play better orally, but the contender is kind of funny, just with the

1781
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:56,680
K.

1782
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:57,680
Yeah.

1783
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:04,640
It's not a title, but I do like that play on words.

1784
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:06,800
We could have had some communication puns as well.

1785
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,280
We missed out there.

1786
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:09,280
Some communication puns?

1787
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,280
What do you mean?

1788
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,280
Yeah.

1789
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,280
We really lost out there, didn't we?

1790
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:13,280
With a K or something?

1791
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,080
No, because the radio stuff.

1792
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:16,080
Oh.

1793
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,080
Yeah.

1794
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:39,200
We really missed an opportunity there.
