1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
I was gonna go on a whole Rocky Linux rant today,

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,340
but I decided not to put it in the show.

3
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,220
But my thoughts are, and I wish them all the best,

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,800
and I think it's really exciting,

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,860
but it feels like the community has already awarded them

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,780
the crown without really them shipping yet.

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,460
I mean, they just shipped their final version.

8
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,300
They haven't become, they're not going to be

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,420
a truly open, free, charitable organization.

10
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,660
They're gonna be a for-profit organization.

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,180
And they don't necessarily have the experience

12
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,500
that Alma Linux has behind it,

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,780
who's already been building a CentOS clone for a decade,

14
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,540
and has already shipped a stable version,

15
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,220
and has now launched additional products on top of that,

16
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,540
and has a really easy support contract,

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,020
and has a true nonprofit organization behind it.

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,540
And I feel like we look at this,

19
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,460
and I'm like, yeah, Rocky Linux looks really great.

20
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,820
It's got a good, solid team.

21
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,900
It's got an excited community.

22
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,940
But when you look at the rubber meeting the road

23
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,980
as it comes to CentOS, traditional CentOS replacements,

24
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,760
I feel like the community's called it too soon.

25
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,020
They've called it for Rocky Linux

26
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,220
when Alma Linux really has all the best features

27
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,540
and seems to be the most viable contender.

28
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,420
Yeah, it seems like maybe there was a presumption here

29
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,100
that Rocky seemed like it was more of the community effort

30
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,940
at the start, perhaps because Cloud Linux was so involved

31
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,700
in getting Alma Linux off the ground.

32
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,540
But yeah, you're right.

33
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,540
I mean, one, it's just crazy early days

34
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,100
for either of these, regardless.

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,180
But, you know, it takes time to actually figure out

36
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,300
which one is gonna be more of the community-minded distro

37
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,300
at the end of the day.

38
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,100
How many times year after year do they hit their promises?

39
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,380
And Alma Linux is checked every box so far.

40
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,260
And I don't, you know, I don't have a dog in this hunt,

41
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,740
but it seems like the cult of personality has won here.

42
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,700
And because a former co-founder of CentOS

43
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,420
is involved with Rocky Linux,

44
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,060
everyone's just decided, well, that's the winner.

45
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:57,100
Welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show, my name is Chris.

46
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,180
My name is Wes.

47
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,100
Hello, Wes.

48
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,340
Coming up on the show today,

49
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,580
we decided to attempt something they say can't be done.

50
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,140
We want our beer and we want to drink it too.

51
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,340
I'll tell you about that.

52
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,980
But first, this episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru,

53
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,540
the leader in hands-on learning.

54
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,460
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

55
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,380
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs,

56
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,140
cloud Linux servers, and much more.

57
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,620
So get your hands cloudy at acloudguru.com.

58
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,820
Is it possible a workstation with an Ubuntu LTS base,

59
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,220
but maybe with a few select fresh user land native apps,

60
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,580
can you bring Arches coveted AUR to Ubuntu?

61
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,060
Is it possible?

62
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,860
This week I challenged Wes to get the AUR working on Ubuntu.

63
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,380
And to my surprise, he did it.

64
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,220
We'll explain more.

65
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,020
We'll tell you where it falls short and where it's going.

66
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,020
And all of the exciting things you're gonna be able to do with it and

67
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,520
some other ideas a little outside the box that could work on all kinds of

68
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,500
distributions.

69
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,140
But first, before the show goes on,

70
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,700
we've got to say time appropriate greetings to our virtual log.

71
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,740
Hello, Mumble Room.

72
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,220
Hello, Chris and Wes.

73
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,380
Hello, everybody.

74
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,100
Man, is it good to see you.

75
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,940
I've been looking forward to chatting with you all week.

76
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:16,300
And before we get into the news, there is something we have to take care of.

77
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,300
It's been a little while.

78
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:26,460
Wes Payne, are you ready for an Arch server update?

79
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,300
Boy, am I ever ready for these fully?

80
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:29,940
I don't know.

81
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,500
We've got 206 packages today.

82
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,940
That's like three gigs installed, but you know, it's only like a net 50 MB upgrade.

83
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,860
I love that.

84
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,940
So for those of you new to the show, from time to time,

85
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,500
we upgrade our production server live on the air as part of our commitment to you

86
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,220
to do something you should never do, and that is run Arch on your production

87
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,060
server.

88
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,140
And to stay accountable, as long as we run this server, we will update it.

89
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,780
And if it breaks right here on air, we'll have to admit it to you.

90
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,380
Wes, are you ready to pull the trigger?

91
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,340
Standing by.

92
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,100
OK.

93
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,020
Do we have WireGuard in that update list?

94
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,940
WireGuard tools, yes, we do, and a new stable kernel minor version.

95
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,700
I feel like we always have kernel updates,

96
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,340
even though we went with the LTS version.

97
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,100
Yeah, I think they're just smaller updates.

98
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,340
Hopefully that means things break less, but really, I

99
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,300
think what we were hoping for was just like fewer package updates at that level,

100
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,220
and I'm not sure how much we've gotten that.

101
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,180
All right, you want to pull the trigger?

102
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,380
Linux LTS 5.10, here we come.

103
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:41,420
I swear we have all of these dang kernel updates,

104
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,820
even though we went with the LTS.

105
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,940
So we'll check back in.

106
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,380
That's got to download the packages and start installing.

107
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,380
You will holler, Wes, if anything goes sideways.

108
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:48,860
Will do.

109
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,740
Otherwise, we'll find out how it went.

110
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,100
And Wes, I have fantastic news.

111
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,020
I have like best news of the week news that I have been waiting to tell you

112
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,060
until we are live on air.

113
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,980
Are you ready for that?

114
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,820
What do you have today?

115
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,900
Bombshell.

116
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,340
So you remember last week, we announced that we're going to do a road trip

117
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,060
to Salt Lake City and to Denver, and we're going to do a meetup

118
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,780
in both those locations.

119
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,620
We're going to do a team reunion.

120
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,140
That's all still going.

121
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,980
Like nothing changes there.

122
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,700
However, now I'm happy to say that Linode is on board

123
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,020
to help finance the trip and make it possible from a technical standpoint.

124
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,500
And so we're taking it up a notch, and we're going to call it Linode on the road.

125
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,300
It's the great road trip at a scale we've never done before.

126
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,820
Now that Linode is helping us, we're going to create new exclusive road

127
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,780
shows, interviews with the crew, the places we visit,

128
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,580
the stories we'll gather when we get together.

129
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,580
We're going to have independent releases separate of this show that

130
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,900
are made possible by Linode.

131
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,380
We'll have details on that very soon.

132
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,340
I'm really excited to get produced more content

133
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,380
and have something that's unique.

134
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,300
And we'll have some conversations on there that you won't want to miss

135
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,420
and some old friends you haven't heard from in a little while.

136
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,300
We're making plans right now, though, for two meetups in August.

137
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,740
The first meetup will be in Salt Lake City on August 7th.

138
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,220
The second meetup will be in Denver on August 20th.

139
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,780
Not all the details are firm yet.

140
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,060
So if you have any insights on those locations,

141
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,940
if you're a local and you know a great spot to meet up,

142
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,060
totally open to all that feedback right now.

143
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,660
It's all in the planning phases.

144
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,940
But details as we have them are in the meetup pages

145
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,540
at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

146
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,220
And we'll link to each individual meetup in the show notes.

147
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,020
Please sign up and let us know if you're thinking about going

148
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,340
so we can plan accordingly.

149
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,060
New, fresh content, old friends, places we're going to visit.

150
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,740
And my intention is to have the tracker going.

151
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,580
So that way, if we go past your place on the road and it works up,

152
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,380
we can have a spontaneous little meetup, too.

153
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,660
I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

154
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,340
And I am super excited and thrilled

155
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,180
to have Linode helping us make it possible.

156
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,220
Thank you to Linode.

157
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,660
I'll tell you more about all that.

158
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,980
But that just got all figured out in the last couple of days.

159
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,460
And we've been talking to System76

160
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,820
about getting a factory tour while we're there, too,

161
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,140
so we can see how the launch keyboard is made.

162
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,180
That's in the works.

163
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,020
And we're making dinner plans with folks.

164
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,820
I'm very excited after the last event I went to

165
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,300
was Texas Cyber Summit.

166
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,780
And it just really wasn't my thing.

167
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,780
In fact, that event made me more profoundly concerned

168
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,900
about the state of the cybersecurity industry

169
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,020
than anything else.

170
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,260
And it actually sat with me in a really kind of awkward,

171
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,020
negative way for a long time.

172
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,260
Not a good community event to end on.

173
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,460
No, it wasn't, Wes.

174
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,940
And so this is, oh, man, I needed this so bad.

175
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,300
And I think a lot of people, a team reunion,

176
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,140
we haven't seen each other in a long time.

177
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,540
That's going to be incredible.

178
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,100
And then a chance to see the audience.

179
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,180
So details are in the show notes for all of that.

180
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,660
In the meantime, I am just trying

181
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,900
to get Lady Joups back up and running again.

182
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,340
In fact, I could also use anybody's input on this.

183
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,500
So just a real quick version of the story for context purposes.

184
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,220
Stay a while and listen.

185
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,860
On my way to Montana about a month ago,

186
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,660
heading out east from the Seattle area, in Idaho,

187
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,820
my living room slide broke.

188
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,500
So my RV's got a kitchen slide, a living room slide,

189
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,260
and of course, it's got a bedroom slide.

190
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,540
And for those of you that don't know what I'm talking about,

191
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,660
there's a room on a track that stretches out

192
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,660
from the side of the RV.

193
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,780
And it gives you more space.

194
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,100
And so for a family of three kids, two adults and a dog,

195
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,460
you essentially go from having a kitchen and a living room

196
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:33,940
to not.

197
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,140
And it makes it so you can go down the road.

198
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,020
You park, you set up, you got a lot more space.

199
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,780
Wonderful idea.

200
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,980
However, in the time around when, well, really,

201
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,260
still even today, but in 2014 when Lady Joups was built,

202
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,940
the Schwintex slide system was not properly installed.

203
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,820
And so we've been fighting that son of a bitch for years now.

204
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,380
Five years, it's just been a constant struggle.

205
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,060
A money pit.

206
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,980
And it's a real damn shame because, you know,

207
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,380
Joups is decked out with solar.

208
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,580
She's got lithium batteries.

209
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,000
She's got the coolest internet setup I could ever possibly

210
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,660
have.

211
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,660
All these little upgrades, she's our family home

212
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,140
with tons of memories in her.

213
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,420
You don't want to give that up.

214
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,380
I mean, just the work alone, let aside the attachment.

215
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,700
So all the slides were out when we were in Idaho

216
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,380
because we're making room for the family.

217
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:17,300
I bring in the bedroom slide, I bring in the kitchen slide,

218
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,060
everything's fine.

219
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,540
I bring in the living room slide, it stops halfway.

220
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,460
Of course, we're supposed to leave in two hours

221
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,820
and I can't get my slide in and I

222
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,980
can't go down the road with the slide out

223
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,900
because I'll be clipping everybody going down the road.

224
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,020
So I call a tech, he says, yeah, we're two hours out.

225
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,740
And I'm like, yeah, but I got to leave here in two hours.

226
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,260
So I go to the office, they say, yeah, you know what,

227
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,500
Mr. Fisher, we understand.

228
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,660
This stuff happens.

229
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,060
You guys don't worry about it.

230
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,820
You can stay all night if you need to.

231
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,900
Wolf Lodge, by the way, in Idaho, shout out to them.

232
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,820
They really were really great about it.

233
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,620
The tech comes out and we determine that we

234
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,660
can't resolve this in the field.

235
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,740
There's just no real, no solution here.

236
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,020
And the only option is to disengage the motors

237
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,900
because they have a magnetic lock to prevent the slide from just

238
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,020
arbitrarily moving in and out.

239
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,740
Of course.

240
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,580
Disengage the motors and we have to slam it in.

241
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,540
And I hurt myself doing this like an idiot.

242
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,500
I popped a rib out, hurt for weeks,

243
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,220
made the whole trip agonizing.

244
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,780
On our way back, we call up our shop

245
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,500
that we've been going to for years and we say, hey, guys.

246
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,820
And this is where I need the audience's help.

247
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,540
We say, hey, guys, the slide that you just

248
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,380
fixed in March is busted again.

249
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,900
We immediately get the cold shoulder.

250
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,780
Like, I can tell they're done fixing this problem because it's

251
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,460
a pain in the ass to work on.

252
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,620
And they're sick and tired of this and they're busy.

253
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,780
They're packed.

254
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,580
They basically say without saying,

255
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,580
we're kind of done fixing this.

256
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,820
So we kind of decided we got to find somewhere else.

257
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,660
Found a local guy near the studio who's

258
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,180
kind of known for fixing slides.

259
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,780
So it just seems like, what a great opportunity.

260
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,740
15 minutes from the studio, this guy's

261
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,540
built custom slide systems.

262
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,020
This seems like the way to go.

263
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,860
Go to his website, even charges less than our standard shop.

264
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,060
Oh, man, that's great because we just had this fixed in March.

265
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,420
Bring Lady Joops in.

266
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,300
And I pull in and I go, this is a little weird.

267
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,340
He's using storage units as his workshop, which is fine.

268
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:01,140
A little unconventional, but I used to podcast out of a garage.

269
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,420
OK, that's fine.

270
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,700
We get there, we're going through the work order,

271
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
he says to me.

272
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:10,140
Oh, by the way, our rate now, instead of $85, is $125 an hour.

273
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,260
OK.

274
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,180
And you have to pay in cash.

275
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:21,460
OK, I don't generally carry a lot of cash on me, but OK.

276
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,940
He starts doing the work and days go by.

277
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,740
Days go by.

278
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,700
He then gives us a diagnosis, kind of

279
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,620
seems in line with what I expect.

280
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,460
More days, five more days go by.

281
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,940
As days go by here, I mean, that's your home, right?

282
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,500
This is where you're most comfortable,

283
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,380
where you've optimized for your work and enjoyment in life.

284
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,620
Yeah, that was horrible.

285
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,260
That 10 days was horrible.

286
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,300
We get it back yesterday, $4,200 cash out of pocket, right?

287
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,980
I got no cashier's check, had to be cash.

288
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,260
And he's got the RV, right?

289
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,100
So it's not like I can really argue with him,

290
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,820
because he's got it in a locked storage bay behind a gate.

291
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,220
I got to give this guy his money if I want my RV back.

292
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,380
Buddy says he fixed the slide.

293
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,780
Sounds like the beginning of a movie, maybe?

294
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,420
I know, right?

295
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,820
Get in there, slide seems like it's working.

296
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,740
We close it all up, we drive it home, set up.

297
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,300
First thing I do, level out the RV and go put out the slide.

298
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,380
It immediately breaks.

299
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,820
I wasn't even home for 10 minutes before it was broken.

300
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,020
It just clearly wasn't fixed.

301
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,500
$4,200 in cash, too, right?

302
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,580
So it's not like I can just reverse the transaction.

303
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,540
And I guess why I'm putting this out there is,

304
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,260
A, I obviously have a timeline.

305
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,340
I got to get this fixed before the Denver trip.

306
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,700
That's the mission now.

307
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,500
So I'm appealing to anyone in the audience who

308
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,740
might know of a shop or a technician who

309
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,980
has solved these rickety, poorly installed Schwintex slide

310
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,580
systems before.

311
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,220
It's a very specific kind of slide type.

312
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,980
It has to be that particular type.

313
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,340
And I'm just putting that out there

314
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,780
because this is going to become an issue for this trip

315
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,380
to Denver now.

316
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,780
I got to get this fixed.

317
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,540
And I don't have that kind of money.

318
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,140
Like that, $4,200 hurt.

319
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,140
It hurt a lot.

320
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,980
It hurts because it was only yesterday.

321
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,500
It still hurts.

322
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,820
It's really got me wrecked, actually.

323
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,940
I mean, that's other things you can't

324
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,940
do, other upgrades, things for your kids, things for JB,

325
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,260
all kinds of stuff.

326
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,780
Well, the situation is a little more bleak than that even.

327
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,380
I'd like to have my savings account

328
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,300
for medical emergencies or some kind

329
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:23,300
of other unforeseen accident because I'm self-insuring.

330
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,540
And that's what I'm cutting into with that.

331
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,180
And that's why it matters a lot.

332
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,220
And I got to get it fixed again.

333
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,020
I'm going to try to get this guy to get it right.

334
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,020
But I'm not comfortable continuing to dump money

335
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,740
into this hole for multiple reasons.

336
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,500
So if anybody knows somewhere that really does a great job,

337
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,860
I'm looking into the Vroom slide systems.

338
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,420
But I haven't heard any testimonials

339
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,140
of anybody who's ever tried it.

340
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,460
And my goal is to get this fixed, get it fixed right,

341
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,820
and then get on the road and have a hell of a road trip

342
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,820
and meet up with people.

343
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,060
So I'm appealing to anybody out there who might

344
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,340
have some input or some tips.

345
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,560
I know it's kind of off our normal beaten path here.

346
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,340
But man, it's got me down today.

347
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,540
I'm just in a bad way.

348
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,540
And so it's one of those things, I've

349
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,380
been fighting this thing for five years.

350
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,780
And I'm beyond the point of wanting this solved.

351
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,180
So if you could contact me, chris at jupiterbroadcasting.com,

352
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,580
or on Telegram, chrislass, or on Twitter, chrislass,

353
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,940
you'd be really helping us out.

354
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,980
So thank you, and on with the show.

355
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,980
Because we do have some fantastic community news

356
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,820
this week.

357
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,160
I'll give you a little more time for that arch update, Wes.

358
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,020
This is the announcement I have been

359
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,580
waiting to make on the show for 10 years.

360
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,840
Well, on some show for 10 years.

361
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,140
That is that NVIDIA's beta driver that is currently

362
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,140
available to download, the new 470 series,

363
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:43,500
has out of the box Wayland support, including xWayland.

364
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,180
It's here.

365
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,860
The first beta driver that makes it possible

366
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,500
to use your full GPU and Wayland at the same time.

367
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,100
They've released a public beta test

368
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,260
of the proprietary driver, which supports hardware acceleration.

369
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,220
This is being brought to us by folks

370
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,420
that have worked with NVIDIA at Red Hat and Fedora Project.

371
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,380
And the Fedora Project is making this announcement today.

372
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,740
Now, you will probably need Fedora or another up-to-date distro

373
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,460
here, because it requires some changes and fixes in xWayland.

374
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,860
But they're already part of the current build shipped

375
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,740
with Fedora 34, of course.

376
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,200
Yeah, other distributions, you're

377
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,780
just going to need to update that stuff.

378
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,700
They're looking for people to help them test this right now.

379
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,180
There's a lot of work that still needs to be done.

380
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,420
So they're asking for people to participate in this.

381
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,820
You also need to reconfigure your GDM display manager

382
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,180
on Fedora, because right now it's

383
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,020
set to automatically disable Wayland when

384
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,500
the NVIDIA driver is loaded.

385
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,980
So you'll have to solve that.

386
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,100
There's some issues, though, Wes.

387
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,980
We got to be honest.

388
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,460
It's not great at this point.

389
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,940
Yeah, if you happen to like running Chromium-based

390
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,020
browsers, yes, including regular old Chrome,

391
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,740
well, there's an issue with Chromium's GPU sandboxing,

392
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,900
which means you just get a blank window,

393
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,380
unless you tack on tech tech disable tech GPU

394
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,060
to the command line, and you can work around that for now.

395
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,980
Not ideal.

396
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,980
Yeah, it's not ideal, no.

397
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,260
And it's not just Chrome.

398
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,180
Applications such as Blender or Steam

399
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,060
sometimes just show a black window.

400
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,060
That's an issue which should be addressed later.

401
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,460
They know about that.

402
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,220
There's also some problems with GTK4 applications just

403
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,900
showing nothing sometimes.

404
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,060
That's also a known issue.

405
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,340
It's already been reported upstream,

406
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,260
but you need to know about it before you're going to use it.

407
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,620
And there's even some Firefox problems.

408
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,300
Yeah, if you thought, OK, well, Chrome's not working.

409
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:28,780
Great.

410
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,140
What about Firefox?

411
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,580
Now, it turns out there is an issue with EGL here,

412
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,500
and I guess like an ambiguity in the specification.

413
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,380
And Mesa went one way with their interpretation

414
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,060
in this new NVIDIA implementation,

415
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,860
and it goes the other way.

416
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,020
Of course, Firefox web render, it relies on the Mesa version.

417
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,220
So you do have to disable hardware rendering

418
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,580
if you want this to work.

419
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,940
Yeah, it seems like right now there's

420
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,260
going to be a lot of that.

421
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,300
These are just the identified issues.

422
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,900
Yeah, there's even an issue with KDE's Wayland compositor

423
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,980
that also has a problem with full screen GLX applications.

424
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,700
So yeah, it's kind of all over the place.

425
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,620
But this is still a huge improvement,

426
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,100
and these are exactly the kind of issues

427
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,500
that you need to go through this process to get those fixed

428
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,860
and really get it polished.

429
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,860
Yeah, I mean, it's funny, though,

430
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,900
because this has been one of the most anticipated

431
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,740
aspects of Wayland adoption for a really, really long time.

432
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,580
But in the free software world, we

433
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,340
don't get these big onstage splashes

434
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,940
where there's some high-end video

435
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,980
production of some famous executive that comes up

436
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,180
on stage and says, and today we're

437
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,660
enabling Wayland on NVIDIA.

438
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,580
Boom, and a slide drops down.

439
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,780
We don't have that.

440
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,140
We don't have these moments that the tech press then grabs

441
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,180
and says, a fundamental aspect of this transition

442
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,340
has arrived, enabling the future of Wayland.

443
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,140
We don't have that kind of hype cycle

444
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,780
that you'll get when there's something about Windows 11

445
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,860
or something about the Mac.

446
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:00,940
But these little moments where a Fedora contributor posts

447
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,260
on their mailing list of sorts that, hey, all.

448
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,540
Oliver just says, hi, all.

449
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,300
It's here today in video release.

450
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,820
It's just like this.

451
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,100
It's the most nonchalant, low-key milestone ever,

452
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,540
and yet the ramifications are huge.

453
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,340
And I really encourage people to try it.

454
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,620
I've got an NVIDIA box in here, and if we

455
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,220
re-base on Fedora, I'll absolutely try it at some point.

456
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,580
I only have one NVIDIA box anymore,

457
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,260
because I've so sort of either gone Intel or AMD.

458
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,700
And I imagine a lot of people have

459
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,180
made a lot of those transitions.

460
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,380
So if you have the capability of testing this,

461
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,940
you're kind of a few select.

462
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,500
And so we'll link to the beta display driver.

463
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,580
And we get to celebrate the moment here, quiet and low-key.

464
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,580
But we acknowledge that it's happened, and it's here.

465
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,100
Also, in that same vein, the ButterFS train

466
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,980
chugs right along.

467
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,820
A little steam-powered there.

468
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,260
Fedora Cloud, another spin of Fedora, is adopting ButterFS.

469
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,740
And they've been thinking about this.

470
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,340
We haven't really talked about it yet,

471
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,180
because it was just up for consideration, really.

472
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,100
The idea is that Fedora Cloud installs

473
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,180
will provide ButterFS by default. And then you

474
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,180
could take advantage of transparent compression

475
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,460
on VPSs and other places where you might run Fedora Cloud.

476
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,100
And get snapshots, of course.

477
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,500
Well, today, the code to actually make that transition

478
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,540
was committed.

479
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,500
So it is real.

480
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,820
It's actually happening.

481
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,380
Another spin of Fedora is switching to ButterFS.

482
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,140
In some sense, maybe it seems inevitable.

483
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,060
But I don't know.

484
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,100
This must mean the rollout's going pretty darn well, right?

485
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,980
Yeah, I wouldn't expect it to go much further, though.

486
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,860
And I don't think people should take that as any kind of statement

487
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,700
on the ButterFS traction or results.

488
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,500
Fedora Server and Fedora Core OS are not

489
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,500
built like Fedora Cloud and Fedora Workstation.

490
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,180
And are they kind of off on their own thing?

491
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,980
And I think Fedora Server, probably there's

492
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,420
probably a lot more politically around that with Red Hat.

493
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,220
And Red Hat doesn't necessarily have

494
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,300
customers knocking on their door demanding ButterFS.

495
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,300
And that's kind of what I want to talk about here is, what's

496
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,180
the line, people?

497
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,580
I'm talking to you ButterFS skeptics right now.

498
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,780
I'm sure so many of you actually use ButterFS in production, too.

499
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,980
So you actually have informed opinions.

500
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,100
What's the line?

501
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,900
20,000 Facebook servers running ButterFS?

502
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,340
Very popular distributions using ButterFS by default?

503
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,180
Synology shipping ButterFS on their NASes for a decade?

504
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,980
What's the line when you stop becoming a ButterFS skeptic and you go, oh,

505
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,660
maybe there is something here.

506
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,620
Maybe I should re-evaluate my opinion.

507
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,580
Maybe things in the technology space change.

508
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,300
And when you get developers who have an invested interest to improve a file

509
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,300
system for their production environment, it gets better.

510
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,020
Where's that line at?

511
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,860
Because what I saw a lot of was people scoffing at the story.

512
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,900
Well, I bet they'll switch back.

513
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,940
They're going to regret that.

514
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,420
Lol, ButterFS.

515
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,620
Boy, what a joke.

516
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,580
And I don't care what file system you use.

517
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,020
I use XFS and ButterFS and ZFS interchangeably, really.

518
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,260
Well, not interchangeably, but for different jobs.

519
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,300
I don't care.

520
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,620
I'm not getting paid every time I plug ButterFS or something.

521
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,980
I don't have a stake in it.

522
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,100
But I just intellectually am curious for you.

523
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,380
Where's your damn line?

524
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,660
Because how much success does something have before you're

525
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,060
willing to re-evaluate?

526
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,700
And if you don't have an answer for that, maybe you should consider the fact

527
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,860
that you're being a bit of a jackass about this.

528
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:34,700
And I'm sick and tired of when we have something great in our community,

529
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,940
the bias against it, for whatever reason, like canonical experiences

530
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,900
constantly as well.

531
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,060
It's like it doesn't matter how great a technology is, like MIR,

532
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,980
which is still around and kicking.

533
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,340
It just never has a shot because of the canonical bias.

534
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,940
And ButterFS is kind of experiencing that same kind of branding.

535
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,580
It's like they've been typecast as a bad file system.

536
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,220
And they'll never be able to play any other role than that because people

537
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,540
have made up their minds.

538
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,260
And I find that so frustrating in a technology community,

539
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:09,580
in a community specifically of Linux where things are always changing.

540
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,860
Assumptions are always being reversed.

541
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,060
New code and new people with new reasons and new products are always coming

542
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:18,460
into the free software community and contributing code and

543
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,140
changing the direction of things.

544
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,580
We watch it happen over and over again.

545
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,420
And yet, even when it's happening right in front of us,

546
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,460
some of us can't recognize it.

547
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,660
I find that frustrating.

548
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:31,580
And I don't mean to get up on a soapbox, but I honestly would like to open up

549
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,420
that conversation a little bit with some of you out there and go,

550
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,820
so where is that line at?

551
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,260
Where's the I'll reconsider?

552
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:42,780
Lino.com slash unplugged, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account.

553
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,460
And you support this here show.

554
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,620
It's a way of saying, hey, I heard about that ad there on the unplugged podcast.

555
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,580
And I want those guys to keep doing shows.

556
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,740
Lino.com slash unplugged, our hosting provider, full stop.

557
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,860
I know there's a lot out there every time I go with Linode.

558
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,380
It is in part due to the performance, no doubt about it.

559
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,740
That is always a factor for me.

560
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,660
Linode is screaming fast.

561
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,100
And I like that they have 11 data centers that I can choose from so

562
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,660
I can put something close to you guys.

563
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,260
Or I could put something close to me depending on if an internal thing or

564
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,340
an external thing.

565
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,140
That's obvious, that's great.

566
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,180
But I think when you look at all the different options out there,

567
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:19,540
I can't just tell you it's the one thing about Linode that has really made me stick.

568
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,100
My transformation with Linode was just curiosity.

569
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,700
Almost two and a half years ago, I just wanted to try them.

570
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:31,340
Cuz I tried just about everybody else, but I had seen Linode at Linux Fest.

571
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,980
Every year, I had seen Linode at a bunch of events.

572
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,180
They always had a great booth.

573
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,860
They always seemed like really great people.

574
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,660
They always had a smile on their face.

575
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,460
And they were doing this kind of stuff way before anybody else.

576
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,980
They just turned 18 years old this month.

577
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,180
They've been doing this for 18 years.

578
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,300
That's amazing.

579
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,140
And they have used that time to really build the best in virtualized cloud

580
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,900
computing.

581
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,700
And that's why it's not just like, it's like the speed or it's the UI or

582
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,380
the API or the command line client.

583
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,940
It's like everything.

584
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,740
Because when you've been doing something for 18 years, and you focused on that.

585
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,420
They didn't launch all these crazy side businesses and go out and

586
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,220
get a bunch of VC funding and just start dumping on the market.

587
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,940
They built a competitive product.

588
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:18,540
And then, years into doing it, a decade into doing it, Linode had to pivot and

589
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,940
start competing with every DNS provider that wanted to give hosting.

590
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,420
With every VC backed company that wanted to go out there and

591
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,420
get you to buy their servers at pennies on the cost.

592
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,540
Linode had to pivot and compete with that, but stay independent.

593
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:39,540
They managed to step up to the plate and exceed what everybody else is doing.

594
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:43,020
And I can tell you as a long timer now, one of the things I really like about

595
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,460
Linode is just that constant, smooth, improved iteration.

596
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,380
Like in this last year, they rolled out cloud firewalls to everybody.

597
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:56,700
They have deployed Terraform support, Ansible module support, Kubernetes.

598
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,140
They just have stayed current along the way, without screwing up my workflow.

599
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,780
If I don't wanna use any of that stuff, it's not all in my face.

600
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,580
They've managed to keep the UI clean and usable.

601
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,980
They have a ton of great options from $5 a month rigs,

602
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,300
which are totally, totally screamers.

603
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,500
I mean, for 30 to 50% less than what you get at AWS,

604
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,980
you're gonna get something faster and cheaper, right?

605
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,500
I mean, that's a big deal because it's an ongoing cost.

606
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,860
And so if you can get something 30 or 50% cheaper, and

607
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:30,780
it's 30 or 50% cheaper every month, plus you get $100 credit just by supporting

608
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,460
this show, there's a lot of value in that.

609
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,100
And then, yeah, it happens to be super great.

610
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,620
The UI happens to be fantastic.

611
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,260
They have fantastic S3 compatible object storage too, check, check, check, check.

612
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,780
This is why we use Linode every single time for our back end stuff, and

613
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,660
for my personal stuff too.

614
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,940
It's a practical thing, and I think you'd really like it.

615
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,780
So go over to linode.com slash unplugged.

616
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,460
Get $100 for your new account and try this stuff out.

617
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,820
Build something, learn something, deploy something.

618
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,460
There are a lot of ways to host things.

619
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,180
There's a lot of various companies, but

620
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,340
none of them are the complete package like Linode.

621
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:08,300
That's why we choose Linode every single time, linode.com slash unplugged.

622
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:16,860
Okay, Wes, I bought you some time.

623
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,500
Let's check on that arch update.

624
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,620
How's it going over there?

625
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,380
Well, it's going pretty well so far.

626
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,940
We've made it through the regular packages, and we're on to the AUR updates,

627
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:33,860
which not only includes updates for the AUR helpers we've got, but also CFSDKMS,

628
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,500
which is building right now.

629
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,580
And this is where it sometimes gets a bit squirrely for us.

630
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,020
You gotta make sure DKMS figures things out right, and

631
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,980
not only builds the modules for the current kernel, but

632
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,900
also that new kernel we're gonna be rebooting into, hopefully.

633
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,540
Okay, all right, so we're not done yet.

634
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,340
I'll check back in with you.

635
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,420
That is always the thing.

636
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:58,620
So I know it will boot back up, because our root partition is ButterFS, and

637
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,140
then our big data storage with all of our disks is ZFS.

638
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,420
This is an example, by the way, of how you can use the two technologies together.

639
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,500
It doesn't have to be mutually exclusive.

640
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,220
And we know that ButterFS root partition will mount, so it will boot.

641
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,420
We just might not have all of our data, and all of our applications may fail.

642
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:16,060
That's all.

643
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,900
It's just a partial degradation, that's what we'll call it,

644
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,100
once we get one of those status pages anyway.

645
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,500
We will check back in.

646
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:29,580
You're fighting the good fight there, Wes.

647
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,420
Keep it up, keep it up, keep it up.

648
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:35,980
In the meantime, a little spot of housekeeping here.

649
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,420
Just a reminder, you can go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting to get all of

650
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:43,540
our meetups that we may do in the future, including the Salt Lake City and Denver 1.

651
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,260
We love your emails and feedback.

652
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,860
Send us those at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

653
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:54,300
And don't forget about the Love Blog this Sunday, and every Sunday, at noon Pacific,

654
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,340
or whatever that converts to in your local time, we have it on our calendar,

655
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,580
in our Mumble Room, right there in the lobby.

656
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,260
Hang out with like-minded folks, talk Linux, ask questions.

657
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,100
If you've got a project you're working on you'd love to share with the class,

658
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,540
they love that kind of stuff.

659
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:12,540
You can find out details for our Mumble server at linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

660
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,100
You go there, you get it all configured, you join the Love Blog and just hang out.

661
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,940
You participate as much or as little as you choose.

662
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,540
And then, gosh darn it, you know what?

663
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,060
You got your Mumble client set up.

664
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,660
You could join us on a Tuesday if you had a Tuesday off or something.

665
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,860
You wanna come out and hang out with your buddies during the show?

666
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,660
We've got a quiet listening spot where you just get the absolute lowest latency,

667
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,780
high-quality audio feed right there in our Mumble Room,

668
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,780
using a whole free software stack.

669
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,020
Cuz we're on Linux here, Mumble's free software.

670
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,940
You can listen to the show live with almost no latency,

671
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,740
as close as technically possible, in our Mumble Room in the quiet listening.

672
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,180
And then if something piques your interest,

673
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,500
you can pop into the On Air channel and chat with us in the show.

674
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,100
We open it up to anyone in our community as long as you pass the mic check and

675
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,340
stuff like that.

676
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,900
Details at linuxunplug.com slash mumble for that.

677
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,100
And join that Love Blog, it is a great group and

678
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,100
it's every single Sunday, talking Linux.

679
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,060
People just love that kind of stuff.

680
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,860
And I need that personal connection from time to time.

681
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,100
And whenever we can, we pop in there on a Sunday as well.

682
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:17,580
Linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

683
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,500
Arch update, we've finished our AUR packages.

684
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,140
DKMS modules compiled, I think we're ready to reboot.

685
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,580
Let's do it, Wes.

686
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,500
Let's do it, here, while you do that, I'll bring up the ping.

687
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,660
And then when I see that it's come back up or you see it's come back up,

688
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,100
we can check in and see what the status is.

689
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,300
You get your ping going now so you can see it fail.

690
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,140
In the meantime, can you get the AUR on Ubuntu?

691
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,460
And why would you want that?

692
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:50,220
And just really briefly, the idea would be some sort of long term stable LTS base.

693
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,740
You have, and maybe this could work on your Ubuntu, your Kubuntu,

694
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,220
maybe even elementary.

695
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,500
Something where you could get a nice, clean, highly compatible,

696
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,460
well supported base, but then get those nice fresh native packages from the AUR.

697
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,340
Telegram and those kinds of things that you just want.

698
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,820
And it could be, perhaps for some, the perfect setup.

699
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:17,700
We looked out there and found a couple of options for doing this on Ubuntu.

700
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,940
And some of them are actually pretty compelling.

701
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,260
Let's start with Paxtol, Wes, which has maybe got a lot of potential.

702
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,140
It's new, though.

703
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,340
Yeah, it's very new.

704
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,900
This is kind of what started our little journey here,

705
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,700
because it comes with a bold claim.

706
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,900
Paxtol, the AUR for Ubuntu.

707
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,420
And yeah, really, that sounds pretty nice.

708
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,140
Okay, we all love the Ubuntu LTS, super stable.

709
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,340
You know what you're getting.

710
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,340
But sometimes the applications, well, they're not up to date.

711
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,380
Or they're not the latest ones.

712
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,020
Or you have to do something else, like get containers involved, or

713
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,020
virtual machines, or compile stuff yourself.

714
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:54,100
That's where Paxtol might be something you're interested in.

715
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,860
It's very simple, pretty easy to get started with.

716
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:01,700
And it's written by a very intrepid 15-year-old specializing in Bash.

717
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Yes, this is just written in Bash.

718
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,660
Yeah, Bash can do the job.

719
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,700
You can do the job with Bash.

720
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:10,140
And it's got a pretty nice user experience.

721
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,700
It's simple.

722
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,540
And it's kind of limited at the moment,

723
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:19,100
because they're essentially recreating their own AUR repository.

724
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,140
Yeah, I think the thing we were hoping for when we first started playing with this

725
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,340
was direct access to the existing AUR.

726
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,380
Because look, the AUR is great, but it's not exactly sophisticated, right?

727
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,180
I mean, it's a user repository.

728
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,220
They're all independently maintained.

729
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,580
Make package is pretty cool, but it's not crazy sophisticated.

730
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:41,620
This is a whole lot simpler to just some bash scripts that kind of help you out,

731
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,700
install some dependencies through apt for you, and that's why it's for Ubuntu.

732
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,620
And then it's got some steps to figure out and run make for you,

733
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,300
whatever compilation steps.

734
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,940
In that way, I think it is very much inspired by the spirit of make package in

735
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,860
the AUR.

736
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,900
It's just a lot less far along right now.

737
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,620
There's only like 50 packages available.

738
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,060
It's not really mature or tested.

739
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,260
I mean, it's just early days.

740
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,020
I think it was started just by the initial author.

741
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,980
But it does seem like there's a small community forming.

742
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,260
You're already seeing more reviews happening, poll requests,

743
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,780
people keeping packages up to date.

744
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,460
So that part's exciting, but

745
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,900
it's a long way from anything you'd ever want to use in production.

746
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,740
And maybe there could be a way to mirror the actual AUR or

747
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:26,700
say like the top 1,000 packages or top 100 packages from the actual AUR to

748
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,380
their own independent AUR.

749
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,340
And maybe they could do that automatically somehow.

750
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,660
And I would love to see them match their syntax to Pacman syntax.

751
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,460
So it's like the same flags to do package operations and things like that.

752
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,580
But it seems like it's really early, and it's not quite what we were looking for.

753
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,300
But it could have potential for Ubuntu users at some point,

754
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,900
especially if they can shore up some of their security stuff and whatnot.

755
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,340
But we wanted something that is truly using the AUR.

756
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:57,500
Because the damn beautiful thing about the AUR is that it's just so

757
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,940
well supported by the community around it.

758
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,900
Any wild ass idea you could have for installing some random package,

759
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,220
it's probably on there.

760
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:11,100
From Windows applications and games that haven't been around in forever,

761
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,340
to your daily drivers like your telegrams and your discords and

762
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:17,980
your element chats, all in there.

763
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,460
All one package manager, all updated centrally, all native,

764
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:26,500
no weird loopback mounts and theme issues.

765
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,780
All just beautiful packages that sometimes get built right on your system.

766
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,140
Right, and when they do, that means you're getting them built on top of Arch,

767
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,540
which provides you all the latest stuff.

768
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,020
So you get the fanciest options,

769
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,380
you can enable all the flags at compilation time that you might need to.

770
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,180
It's really quite slick once you've got it all set up.

771
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,700
Which is how we got to MakeDev and MPM and

772
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:51,660
another set of tools that actually use the real AUR.

773
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,580
And we had mixed results with this, I would say.

774
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,260
You actually did have some success.

775
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:01,340
Yeah, I got Tilder, which is a Rust implementation of TLDR,

776
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,740
which is a handy program from giving you easy examples that maybe you don't quite

777
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,540
find in the man page, but with a similar spirit.

778
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,980
This was a Rust application,

779
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,940
cuz Chris makes me install Rust applications all the time.

780
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,700
I'm not allowed to install Go apps.

781
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,660
Yeah, that's in your contract, no Go apps, Wes.

782
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:22,420
It's tough, but I try to work around it.

783
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,420
And okay, so it did work.

784
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,620
I was able to use MakeDev to get this going.

785
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,620
Here's the idea.

786
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,820
Takes those package builds, yes, the real ones from the AUR.

787
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,180
It's even got some nice command line stuff to go search and

788
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,820
find them for you, which is pretty slick.

789
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,100
Downloads them.

790
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,380
And then the idea is they've got this component, MakeDevDB,

791
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,020
that's like a dependency translation layer to go figure out like, all right,

792
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,620
well the package build has these depths listed.

793
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,100
But we need to go get apt dependencies on the Ubuntu system, and

794
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,900
that's gonna be different.

795
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,820
And that's kind of the key here that I think is really early days and

796
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,140
isn't quite totally fleshed out.

797
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,660
Because to get Tldr to actually quite compile completely and

798
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,340
get a deb that worked nicely, I basically had to do dependency resolution myself,

799
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,620
install the stuff it needed, delete the dependencies from the package build, and

800
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,860
then run MakeDev.

801
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,580
Yeah. But after that, it did work.

802
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,860
So I think that means like, in theory, if you could get that mapping from

803
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,500
arch to Ubuntu dependencies actually maintained.

804
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,860
You had a community effort to make that work and test out some packages.

805
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,020
This might just work.

806
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:29,180
Yeah, what I liked about it too is you could just check out the packages,

807
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:33,140
pull them down on your local system and build them there, old school style too,

808
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,340
if you wanted to.

809
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:38,620
Where I could see this working is if you had a fleet of Ubuntu systems, but

810
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,580
you needed access to a couple of specific apps or

811
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,020
versions that are only in something like the AUR, you could use this and

812
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,620
you could support it and maintain it yourself, and you could run that.

813
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,700
So like for us, we could potentially switch to Fedora, as an example,

814
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,740
if you could do this, switch to Fedora or Ubuntu base here in the studio,

815
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,260
something like that.

816
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,980
And then you put this on top of it, theoretically, and

817
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,980
just get those one or two applications you need.

818
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:05,060
And you don't have to run Arch on the system itself, on the host system.

819
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,900
However, both of those are early days.

820
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,140
So we thought maybe we could look at something a little more universal

821
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,140
that wasn't just targeted at one distribution.

822
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:15,140
And you can crack this nut with containers.

823
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,060
There are people out there that get X applications running inside a container

824
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,220
and go that route.

825
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,820
And by containers here, we mean like your server side, your docker,

826
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,660
stuff like that.

827
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:29,700
Yeah, and of course, this would be pretty much a non-existent problem if the world

828
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,580
could just agree on a universal packaging format like app images, flat pack, or

829
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,660
snaps, and then everybody just shipped as that,

830
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,980
because that would actually solve this problem.

831
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,860
But I could also wish that it rains quarters.

832
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,580
Right, like if there was a flat pack for every package in the AUR, like, yeah,

833
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,940
okay, we wouldn't be so concerned.

834
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,300
This wouldn't really be the question cuz, of course,

835
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,020
you just go get the flat pack, that would work.

836
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:54,420
But right now, I think the AUR still has got the flat hub beat by a mile.

837
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,380
What I do like about the flat pack and container route is that it's not spewing

838
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,780
stuff all over your file system.

839
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,980
Your host box stays nice and clean and fresh.

840
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:06,540
And that's when we started thinking about, what about Fedora's toolbox,

841
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:10,180
which spins up these disposable pet containers with just a command?

842
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,260
You don't even really know it's happening.

843
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,920
You just run toolbox and you get a command line.

844
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,100
And it brings all of your user accounts and

845
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,540
your permission settings from your host system into that environment.

846
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,900
And it's totally transparent.

847
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,900
You don't even realize that you're making a mess in a container instead of on your

848
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,020
file system.

849
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,900
But would it be possible to use Fedora's toolbox tool

850
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,340
with another distro besides a RHEL or Fedora distro?

851
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:37,060
Could you use toolbox with Debian or maybe Arch?

852
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,140
A bold question.

853
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,660
I mean, I played with toolbox a little bit and it really is pretty neat,

854
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,820
especially if you're trying to build some dependencies.

855
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,500
Maybe you're working on packaging something up or playing with container tech.

856
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,860
And yeah, exactly like you say, Chris,

857
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:51,860
you just don't wanna pollute your actual main desktop system.

858
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,260
But it really is quite optimized for Fedora.

859
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,620
That's all the images that they build for themselves.

860
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:01,260
That's what it asks you if you wanna go download that image when you first set it

861
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,300
up and get going with it.

862
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,380
But of course, turns out it's powered by OCI images and

863
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,580
Podman under the hood, so you can do basically whatever you want.

864
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:17,220
Yeah, including building an Arch or Debian image and using that inside toolbox and

865
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:21,020
just spin up a Debian environment on Fedora or an Arch environment on Fedora.

866
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,500
In just, well, as simple as running a single command.

867
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,540
Did you give it a shot?

868
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,220
Yes, I did.

869
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:31,260
Now actually, they've added some stuff to the toolbox docs over on GitHub,

870
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,420
detailing what needs to exist in the image.

871
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,340
And for most common things, those are basically just taken care of.

872
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:41,100
Which Arch, it's a little bit different because it's Arch, it's super minimal.

873
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,420
It doesn't have everything filled out and installed for

874
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,100
you automatically or configured necessarily in Etsy.

875
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,180
So in the past, I know there's been some bugs around like, well,

876
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:52,580
you needed the local time stuff set up and that's not in the base Arch Docker image.

877
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,420
And there's a few issues like that.

878
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,580
But actually, a lot of that's been resolved.

879
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:01,420
The one thing I had to do was manually touch Etsy machine ID,

880
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,580
just to get that in because toolbox is gonna mount that in from the host.

881
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,260
But after I did that, I was able to just sort of install the Pacman base packages.

882
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,540
I installed a couple other apps, including Nano,

883
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,940
cuz I wanted to get that fresh, hot Nano 5.8.

884
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,820
Who doesn't, right?

885
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,940
Just gotta have it.

886
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:21,860
Built it up with a Docker file, or if you're in the Podman world, a container file.

887
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:28,260
And then yeah, toolbox, when you do toolbox create, it's got a dash image option.

888
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,180
And then you just give it the tag of the name that you built for that image.

889
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:37,260
It'll create it, and then you run toolbox enter that name, and you're in.

890
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,020
It totally worked.

891
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:41,500
Now, I haven't gone all the way and tried out complicated stuff with audio and

892
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,220
graphics yet.

893
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,580
This is still early days, but boy, having an easy little Arch toolbox.

894
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,300
Sure.

895
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,740
Anywhere that you can get toolbox running, which is not just Fedora, by the way.

896
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,980
It's packaged in Arch, for instance.

897
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,340
I mean, that sounds great.

898
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,660
Yeah, I love this idea.

899
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,900
You have this fresh, clean Fedora base, or whatever it might be.

900
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,820
Maybe it's CentOS Stream.

901
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,540
I mean, I'm not totally kidding either.

902
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,940
I'm thinking CentOS Stream 9 might make a decent workstation OS.

903
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,260
We'll see, maybe not, but it might.

904
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,160
And then you take something like toolbox, and you have Arch and

905
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,740
Debian user lands that are just in a terminal.

906
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,980
And what you've done is you've kind of created the WSL experience.

907
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:23,580
The one thing that struck me as a nice thing about WSL

908
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:27,140
is I could have a distro per terminal tab.

909
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,780
I had Ubuntu, Debian, and OpenSUSE all running simultaneously,

910
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,380
each with their own tab.

911
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,260
And you could replicate that with toolbox.

912
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,380
And it's all in its own container, so you mess it all up and

913
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,260
your host system stays clean.

914
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,860
I freaking love this little toolbox tool.

915
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:48,060
I bring it up as often as I can because I think it's such a neat idea and

916
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:53,020
such a nice, practical use of containers in a way that's nearly transparent to

917
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,220
the end user.

918
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,940
And it's a great example of what Linux does that Windows and Mac can't.

919
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,780
And I freaking love that too.

920
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,460
And the fact that it's using Podman underneath is neat cuz that's just cool

921
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,140
technology and all that kind of stuff.

922
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,900
Yeah, that's what's neat about toolbox is really is like we've had all these

923
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,820
primitives kind of like with containers in general, right?

924
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,700
Like we've got all these low flung things, but

925
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:14,580
especially in the Linux open source world, what really makes it shine is that

926
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,780
folks have put in the work to make the UI and the UX appealing.

927
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,500
I could do all this stuff by hand with Docker or Podman, but

928
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,300
to get it actually adopted and be more useful day to day,

929
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,700
it takes that extra layer of polish, I think.

930
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,700
I'd love to see the Fedora project get to the point where maybe they could

931
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,340
integrate toolbox even further into the desktop and work on those kinds of things.

932
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:38,380
And maybe even start maintaining a couple of compatibility images like that.

933
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,460
Because it sure is a neat idea and it's a great example of how we can use this

934
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,820
technology if we just connect a few more of these primitives like you're saying.

935
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,740
And yeah, you could wish for everything to get packaged up as a flat pack or

936
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,620
an app image or a snap, but it's never gonna happen.

937
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,780
I mean, that's one of the brilliant things about the AUR is there's just junk

938
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,100
in there that is not gonna get touched by anybody else.

939
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,380
It's some diehard who loves that freaking piece of software and

940
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,580
wants it available.

941
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,660
So he or she is just doing the hard grunt work to get it in the AUR.

942
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,740
And that's why it's there.

943
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,700
Well, and I think it's hit that right balance too, right?

944
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,020
Where you're right, there's a lot of users who are passionate and

945
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,660
have the time and skill to maintain them.

946
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,860
That shouldn't be taken for granted, but it's also simple enough.

947
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:20,220
There's not a lot of bureaucracy or CLAs to sign or

948
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,660
other hoops to jump through to get it actually packaged and done.

949
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:24,020
So I think it makes it pretty easy.

950
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,780
There's a low barrier to entry if you actually wanna throw something up in there.

951
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,380
Can be bad, of course, but I think it also makes it really easy for

952
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,660
folks to get started and put whatever they want in there.

953
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,500
Yep, and you could mix and match and have it to your preference.

954
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:37,100
And I think this could be a, forgive the pun, but

955
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,260
I think it could be a go-to tool for us.

956
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,620
I could see using this frequently.

957
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,940
It could make it possible to have just one base fedora and

958
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,020
then these pets right there in my terminal.

959
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:54,460
Okay, Wes, I see it's replying to pings.

960
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,420
So the server and the network stack are back up.

961
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:02,900
The question is, did everything mount and are applications running?

962
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,540
We are 100% back online.

963
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,420
Look at you.

964
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:12,100
Nicely done, Wes.

965
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,900
You know, I think, I'm not positive.

966
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,460
We should have been keeping track from the beginning, but

967
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:18,460
I think our success rate is higher than our failure rate.

968
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,740
I think you're right about that.

969
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,740
Maybe we'll have to go back and review the episode sometime.

970
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,340
Now, I will say we did have some issues and

971
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,380
there's still some work we want to do around our existing wire guard stack.

972
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,260
Cuz we're still using subspace.

973
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,300
And last upgrade, two upgrades ago, that kind of bit us.

974
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:38,260
Because the existing subspace was set up to rely on tools on the host file system.

975
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,660
And it just gets a little weird when you've got one OS kind of borrowing tools.

976
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,100
And of course, the arch one got updated on the host and didn't play nicely.

977
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,500
We were able to update that and kind of better containerize that setup.

978
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,940
But you never know, something might break again.

979
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:52,100
Yeah, we've got some ideas.

980
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:56,380
We've been kicking around kind of an update to our wire guard infrastructure and

981
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:59,660
then kind of capturing the work we do there and relaying that back to you guys.

982
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,340
Because I think there's some cool tools that we could share with the class.

983
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,140
So we'll probably do that soon, I think.

984
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,820
I've got a couple of VPN ideas I'd like to do on the show soon,

985
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,100
as a matter of fact.

986
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,020
So stay tuned, that'll be coming up.

987
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:14,620
Thank you to our core contributors at unpluggedcore.com.

988
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,380
This episode, the last couple of episodes,

989
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,220
there's not been a sponsor in this spot right now.

990
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,020
This is traditionally where I might mention a previous sponsor we've had right

991
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:22,540
here.

992
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,300
But there isn't one.

993
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,180
Our members are still making it possible for us to do this show though.

994
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,980

00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:49,260
us to keep going when we don't have an advertiser in this spot right here.

1001
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:54,860
And it's slow growing, but I could see a day where we are just this.

1002
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,620
This is always just the spot of the show.

1003

1009
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:18,820
More access to the limited ad feeds, nice, tight, punchy,

1010
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,780
and still all the great production quality.

1011

Unpluggedcore.com, thank you to everybody who does that.

1012
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,940
We really do appreciate your support, especially right now.

1013
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,100
A couple of emails to get to, maybe actually three emails to get to.

1014
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,860
Frank writes in with our first one.

1015
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,700
Yes, he does.

1016
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,540
Frank's been trying Red Hat 6.2, he writes, hi folks.

1017
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:42,740
For nostalgic reasons, I also try to run Red Hat 6.2 in VirtualBox.

1018
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,860
Although I managed to install it, I couldn't get X11 to work.

1019
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:50,460
Just kind of the essential part of the experience I was looking for.

1020
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,660
How did you actually do it?

1021
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,420
You mentioned both bare metal and virtualization.

1022
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,820
Was there any magic trick involved?

1023
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,140
Thanks, Frank.

1024
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,420
Good question, Frank.

1025
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,980
You know, it's tricky when you go further back.

1026
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:06,300
6.2 is further back than any of the distros Wes and I tried, and

1027
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,540
it's gonna be harder.

1028
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:11,820
But I'm pretty sure I was using just the Visa driver.

1029
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,660
It's gonna depend on your virtualization software and

1030
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:16,660
what it presents to the guest.

1031
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,620
So there's that combo you gotta get right.

1032
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,900
But I'm pretty sure during my setup, I didn't push it.

1033
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:27,180
I recall doing like 1024 by 768 and the Visa driver for each machine.

1034
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,580
Whatever, I remember that I had to fiddle with it a little bit.

1035
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:34,820
And then once I got it working on one of them, I just used that same exact

1036
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:39,700
setup for each one of the distros, and that worked for me.

1037
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,540
Yeah, you might try, I don't know, I do like VirtualBox, but

1038
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,580
it's been a while since I really used it day to day.

1039
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,460
So maybe you also give KVM and QEMU a shot.

1040
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,020
Maybe you'll have different results.

1041
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,340
Joe writes in, and he says, it's always great hearing about the latest

1042
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,220
developments on Wayland and Plasma and PipeWire and so on.

1043
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:59,860
However, I think maybe there is a lack of AMD on the show.

1044
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,060
I've tried KDE, GNOME, MATE, and XFC, and

1045
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:05,380
all have issues on AMD Ryzen 5 3500U devices.

1046
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,620
Hmm, GNOME under X11 has been the most stable thus far, though recently,

1047
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,220
a lot of AMD GPU DRM issues have been causing me grief.

1048
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,740
I've submitted bug reports to Red Hat's Bugzilla and

1049
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,540
GNOME and KDE's different trackers.

1050
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:21,500
And MATE and XFCE issues have also been plaguing me,

1051
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,780
including tearing on the XFCE compositor.

1052
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:28,460
Overall, I think it's worth highlighting that while a lot of updates are forward

1053
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:33,100
looking and they're great, maybe a deeper look at AMD hardware could be needed.

1054
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,700
Love the show, thanks again, Joe.

1055
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:38,580
That's true, Joe, we don't do a lot of AMD hardware just because of,

1056
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,300
we'd have to buy it and costs.

1057
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,620
We don't really have a lot of great options either when it comes to laptops.

1058
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:50,740
I did for a good period of time, recently try out the ASUS ROG 14-inch laptop

1059
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:55,940
that has a Ryzen CPU and an AMD GPU and also an NVIDIA RTX in it.

1060
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,140
That's quite the setup.

1061
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:02,780
And I have AMD graphics cards in my workstations upstairs and

1062
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,940
in some in my machine at home.

1063
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:08,380
So I do have some exposure to it and I actually generally find they work

1064
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:08,940
fantastic.

1065
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:14,620
In fact, it's sort of my baseline, any future system I buy at this point,

1066
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,980
although perhaps today's news changes things, but

1067
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:20,420
any future system I buy is gonna have AMD graphics.

1068
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:23,540
I just don't really have an opportunity to buy a lot of Ryzen systems, but

1069
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:26,580
I always keep an eye out and if there is a system we can get in and

1070
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:31,020
do compatibility testing and whatnot, I will jump at that opportunity.

1071
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:34,500
And then in the meantime, I guess we just have to wait for

1072
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,660
West to build his huge Ryzen box.

1073
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,940
Yeah, maybe as the prices team down, eventually I have been wanting to try

1074
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:45,660
that out because, right, I mean, AMD GPU, we've got this great open source story.

1075
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:49,060
But I think in that it's still kind of early, there's a lot evolving and

1076
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,700
of course, as Joe points out, it evolves with the kernel versions too.

1077
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,860
So I'd be kind of curious to know a little more about Joe's setup,

1078
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:58,340
if there were any tweaks that he did.

1079
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,340
And thank you, Joe, for filing those bugs.

1080
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,620
We need those.

1081
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:05,100
I'd also be curious if anyone else out there has either AMD issues or

1082
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,820
AMD success stories to share.

1083
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:09,180
Neil, it sounds like you might have a note about AMD issues.

1084
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:13,260
It sounded like the person in question had AMD Ryzen 5000 series,

1085
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,940
which is, wow, you're really lucky.

1086
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:19,340
Yep. Because it's been pretty hard to get those, but

1087
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,980
it's actually been so hard that none of the distros had access to it.

1088
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,620
Red Hat desktop engineering didn't have it,

1089
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:28,260
SUSE engineering didn't have it, nobody had it.

1090
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:32,340
Nobody for Ryzen 5000, nobody for Radeon RX 6000.

1091
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:37,260
Consequently, the drivers are in much worse shape than they would be normally,

1092
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,260
because they did not get driver engineering sign off first.

1093
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:46,260
It was a bit of a botched release compared to the previous generations of Ryzen and

1094
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:52,420
Radeon for Linux, where AMD typically sends out hardware samples and

1095
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:55,580
offers engineering resources to Red Hat and

1096
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:59,820
SUSE to make sure that these are all in good shape upstream,

1097
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,780
before they're pulled into the respective distributions.

1098
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:04,580
That didn't happen this last cycle, so

1099
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:07,420
the latest hardware has a lot more teething problems,

1100
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:11,140
which is probably going to afflict everyone for a few more months.

1101
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,500
I think that's gonna kind of wind down and

1102
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:18,660
stop being an issue with the kernels coming out towards the end of this year.

1103
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,060
I mean, I've certainly heard from other folks in the Fedora community that things

1104
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,700
have started settling down with the latest kernels that we pushed out.

1105
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:29,580
So take it for what it's worth, but sorry.

1106
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:36,500
Blame AMD for not actually following the normal process this last cycle.

1107
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,300
I don't know what their reasoning was, but it wasn't good.

1108
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,700
And good to know.

1109
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,900
Thank you, Neil.

1110
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:46,580
Moving right along, Austin wrote in, hey guys, love the show and all the work you do.

1111
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,220
Day to day, I work in a Windows environment, but

1112
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:54,780
I am able to use Linux from time to time for certain tasks.

1113
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:59,780
One task is safely exploring phishing and malicious links that hit our company.

1114
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:04,580
Now, to safely do this, I've created a Docker container, installed Firefox, and

1115
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,660
pasted the links into this Docker Firefox browser.

1116
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:11,700
What are your thoughts on this type of security containerization?

1117
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:15,300
And am I actually as safe as I think I am by doing it this way?

1118
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,900
Have you ever tried something like this before?

1119
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,500
Thanks in advance.

1120
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,540
You're probably fine here, Austin.

1121
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:26,180
I am curious though, this seems like, by default, the job for a VM here.

1122
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,700
I mean, then you really know you've got true isolation there.

1123
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,500
Yeah, I think that's the way I would do it too.

1124
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,860
I mean, there's container security has come a long way.

1125
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:36,700
But I also think the state of the art means you need to be a little more

1126
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,420
involved, using some more tools.

1127
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,980
Do you have stuff like SC Linux or App Armor?

1128
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:44,100
Do you have sec comp style filtering enabled?

1129
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,580
Just using a virtual machine, I think, gets you in a lot better default place.

1130
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,660
And it gives you more easy options for trying different kernels and

1131
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:53,500
operating systems if you need to get into that level of detail.

1132
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,740
Or maybe you wanna spin up some Windows VMs to see how the links perform over

1133
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,940
there.

1134
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:00,580
That's a great point, is if you're using virtual machines,

1135
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,540
you could just go destroy a couple of Windows installs and

1136
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,180
find out what happens and document it.

1137
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,740
Yeah, and you feel better afterwards.

1138
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:07,220
It's like bashing a printer.

1139
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:08,900
Just make sure you don't connect it to your main network.

1140
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,260
Maybe have it on its own private network once you get the malware package

1141
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,180
downloaded.

1142
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,180
I think you're probably fine, but Wes makes a good point.

1143
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:18,340
What Wes is really saying here is, for this type of setup, Austin,

1144
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,380
it's not just one thing.

1145
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:23,100
It's not just you're using Firefox in a container.

1146
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,380
In that case, it's gonna be you're actually securing the entire system.

1147
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,500
You're taking a holistic approach to security on that box,

1148
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,140
including some sort of mandatory access control.

1149
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,060
And you're doing proper permissions provisioning, and

1150
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:36,580
you're not running things like the Docker instances as root.

1151
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:41,820
And you're doing things at a higher level to protect the overall system.

1152
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:44,500
You're likely gonna be totally fine in that scenario.

1153
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,660
I think you could feel a lot more confident if you used virtualization.

1154
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:51,060
And I'm just gonna mention, this is maybe a great opportunity to play around with

1155
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:55,580
something like cubes and see if cubes could help even more.

1156
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:58,780
Could be like a tool set for doing this kind of testing.

1157
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,460
Maybe not, it might be too much.

1158
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,020
But I definitely recommend, it's a great Linux distribution.

1159
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:06,500
Check out cubes to see if maybe that could take your game to the next level.

1160
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,060
And in the meantime, keep doing what you're doing, but

1161
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,900
just make sure you're secure all around.

1162
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:14,620
I think there's probably not nearly the kind of risk as, say,

1163
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:19,020
installing Windows on a physical host and using that as a burner.

1164
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,980
Because my main concern there would be something jumps to the network.

1165
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,620
And that could get dangerous.

1166
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:28,220
Exactly, yeah, regardless of how you do this, you're gonna wanna isolate it.

1167
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,380
Yep, yep, very good, very good.

1168
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:34,660
If you'd like to send us an email, we'd love it, linuxunplugged.com contact.

1169
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:38,860
You could also do the Twitter thing, if that's your jam, at linuxunplugged.

1170
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:43,060
The network is at jupitersignal, and the entire network of fantastic podcasts,

1171
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:47,620
cuz there's a whole lot more, over at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1172
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:52,020
That self-hosted podcast is sneaking up on its 50th episode,

1173
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,460
which is a nice milestone, nice and round milestone.

1174
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,180
Hey. I'm trying to think,

1175
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:59,940
maybe if I wanna do a swag item, I haven't really decided yet.

1176
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:03,060
So I may do that, so check out the self-hosted podcast,

1177
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,860
if you haven't in a while, that's a great podcast.

1178
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,700
And of course, if you're not getting your Linux action news fix,

1179
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,380
then you're missing out on the things going on in the open source world.

1180
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,940
So check out linuxactionnews.com.

1181
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:15,460
And then we'd love to have you back here on a Tuesday, if you'd like to join us for

1182
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:20,060
a live show, we do it every Tuesday at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

1183
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:24,060
See you next week, same bat time, same bat station.

1184
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,220
Go say hi to Wes Payne, he's on Twitter, at Wes Payne.

1185
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,220
Darn right.

1186
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:31,220
I'm on there, it's true, at Chris Lass.

1187
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:35,540
At Jupiter Signal is the whole network, and the podcast is at Linux Unplugged.

1188
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:39,500
Links to everything we talked about today are in the show notes at linuxunplugged.com

1189
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,020
slash 411.

1190
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:45,460
And check out our meetups, we wanna know if you're gonna meet up with us.

1191
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:51,260
It's hot right now, but picture a nice cool beverage hanging out with your Linux buddies.

1192
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:53,660
Go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

1193
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:57,620
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of Your Unplugged Program.

1194
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:26,580
And we will see you right back here next Tuesday!

1195
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:43,900
JBtitles.com, let's go boat.

1196
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:48,180
Bypen, I know you wanted to mention something on the GPU discussion, but we had to move

1197
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,020
on, so I wanted to just give you a chance to follow up before we wrap up.

1198
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:56,340
Yeah, so maybe you heard about China cracking down on the Bitcoin farms and other crypto

1199
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:57,340
farms.

1200
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:02,660
So, what will happen when all those farms shut down and dump their cards on the market?

1201
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,660
I was wondering that too.

1202
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,760
Are we gonna see like the prices drop on the used market?

1203
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:12,880
Because if those prices drop enough, even if they're used, the scalpers also need to

1204
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,300
drop their prices and eventually even shops.

1205
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:20,380
And also, I saw an AMD card already drop prices.

1206
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:24,060
It was also mentioned in the news that some cards are dropping prices.

1207
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:26,160
Oh, that is really good news.

1208
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,580
My only concern there would be that the miners in China were using ASICs or dedicated, but

1209
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,260
I'm sure there's some GPU usage.

1210
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,940
I'm ready for those prices to drop.

1211
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:37,900
The fact that the Yakuza was smuggling GPUs says enough.

1212
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:41,080
Oh my god, really the Yakuza?

1213
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,100
Some of their shipments were caught with boats.

1214
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,100
Wow.

1215
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:56,940
I bet they're big gamers over there.
