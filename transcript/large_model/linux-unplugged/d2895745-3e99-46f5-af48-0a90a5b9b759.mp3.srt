1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,800
have you got any feedback from for the Leonard interview to read out on the

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,480
show you know not really not to read on the show because I was in one of the

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,200
debbie and for I was lurking one of the debbie and fork IRC channels was a guy

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,840
in there who was saying who's ranting a little bit about yeah yeah obviously and

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,320
wanted to come on and you know I said well you know come on the mumble and if

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,120
there's any feedback I'm sure you can you know get involved yeah I mean I I

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,000
know that we must have I wonder too if maybe people just kind of given up that

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,880
are really anti system D because I'm sure there was a whole there's more than

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,280
one debbie and fork yes what you mean it wasn't it doesn't have more than one

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,080
debbie that one is more there's another one there's def one in depth to yeah

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:01:00,360
really I actually didn't really I didn't know that how come I ever heard what's

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,760
it called poppy I let me just go and find it to me anything that's derived

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,880
from debbie and there's a fork of debbie and to me refactor now we refactor

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:22,920
refractor refactor can you link it in the in that there IRC hang on this is

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,480
so this project hasn't been getting as much of attention I wonder why that is

16
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,400
maybe because they didn't use the inflammatory language it's the other one

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,920
the Linux that you get oops I just pasted far too much in the IRC that's

18
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,440
actually the topic from the debbie and fork channel where they link to the

19
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:44,840
other debbie and the various debbie and folks including dead one refractor and

20
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:51,440
also on XE canoe so this is there's two so there's three three there is three

21
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,320
debbie and forks Wow burnout squared brilliant yeah so how is this gonna play

22
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,240
out I mean how can this can they really do they genuinely mean like the full

23
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,120
debbie and project fork when they say this or they just mean like the x86

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,240
derivatives that is there's no way they can for call debbie and there simply is

25
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,680
not enough people out there to go in to do it there's barely enough people to do

26
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,360
debbie it's well and there's three of them people to do one fork it's a three

27
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,960
forks I think it's a bit of overkill guest forking DB and why don't we just

28
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,100
make a diss why don't we guess make something else out even just by

29
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:35,000
removing system the inputting I guess it's not really they just don't want to

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,040
be tied on to a way of doing things that's why they're calling themselves

31
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,440
for for now they're a derived distribution until they get to the point

32
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,640
that okay it seems that Debian is going too far off and we are not tied to it

33
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,960
and so it's better to call it a fork from the beginning not get the flame

34
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,040
later on I yeah I guess it's also a mindset thing but yeah technically right

35
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,960
now what they're gonna copy them they're gonna copy everything and then just

36
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,680
start working to not integrate systems it's okay yeah I mean I mean there's

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,740
things like they need to find a replacement for login D and they need to

38
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:12,200
undo all the packaging that integrates system D into gnome for example and then

39
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,640
and then remove whatever else feature wise that system D does is saying that

40
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,680
they actually will try to maintain compatibility with the main Debian thing

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,000
because it not only will facilitate their work but also if Debian once

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,680
probably be able to reassess that back no so this now I guess is the time

43
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,160
isn't it because you got to do it now before system D has been so fully

44
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,680
integrated into Debian that it would be a huge chore to work it out so now is

45
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:49,320
the time to make your move what about a year ago would have been is everybody

46
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,240
totally freaking out about this Linux Trojan it's it's horrible right have you

47
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,380
guys all read about it it's on like every single news website ever right

48
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,720
now yeah until we know what that vector I'm not really caring it's terrifying

49
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,800
it's horrible it's infecting what I guess something it looks like it's

50
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,920
probably it looks like it's probably been around for a few years I mean it

51
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,480
does it it's also they're calling it an advanced persistent threat it looks like

52
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,200
it's targeted at government embassies pharmaceutical companies maybe even even

53
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,440
the code could even be 14 years old as OMG Ubuntu notes infected hundreds of

54
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,760
PCs on the Windows version across 45 countries something yeah yeah I have a

55
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,480
feeling this even though people are going on now it's not safe but it states

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,960
something I actually think this time it is actually states a state sponsored

57
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:44,960
because you have the money and the time to port a virus to nearly every single

58
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,680
major platform yeah yeah ever and the thing you have to realize is like it's

59
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,000
not just the NSA that does this stuff a lot of different divisions of the US

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,680
military have a cyber arm to them and they have people that work on this stuff

61
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,980
but in the terms of like the NSA what they have that tailored access division

62
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,920
and their entire purpose is to identify the technology that the target is

63
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,200
employing and adapt malware to compromise that system that is a

64
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,640
tailored malware even you think Stuxnet wasn't specifically tailored to go after

65
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,240
those centrifuges give me a break so if the if the system is running Linux or

66
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,360
free BSD or Mac OS 10 or Windows they're gonna take advantage of every zero-day

67
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,320
exploit they could possibly find and they're gonna tailor write something for

68
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,440
it and even here it sounds like it is from some of the speculation it sounds

69
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,640
like it jumps machines like it actually still comes in on a Windows box and then

70
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,000
jumps to up to the Linux box I think this kind of stuff is gonna be really

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,640
common well they're only getting to know it's not like they didn't exist right

72
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,520
not to mention it's like until we know the actual attack factor it doesn't mean

73
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,540
anything like for all that matter you might need a specific software to be

74
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,840
running so you can actually get infected in the first place so it can actually

75
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,360
leverage the permission issue yeah that point yeah and you know there's now see

76
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,200
and the reason why I think we hear about this more is it just makes it makes

77
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,320
better headlines now and the press has learned how to write about it in a way

78
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,540
that generates clicks but also outside of that there's just entire companies

79
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,080
now that were not really so focused on this like a lot of this came from work

80
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,400
from Kaspersky labs right you can find a lot of details on the Kaspersky labs

81
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,220
blog well this has now become a huge huge huge aspect of their business they

82
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,160
spend a lot of time and resources on so they're exposing a lot more of this kind

83
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,080
of stuff kids and kitty you said you had something you wanted to add yeah back in

84
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,420
my day Trojans used to protect you from a virus

85
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,400
welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show from a very windy

86
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Pacific Northwest my name is Chris and my name is Matt hey Matt so is the wind

87
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,440
still blowing up in your area I'm getting some gusts you know I took the

88
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,000
dogs out here earlier they didn't blow away so I think we're doing okay I like

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,440
that you go out there and you get blown around a little bit and I thought so you

90
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,040
send me this message you're like hey so we still have power up here I'm like oh

91
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,920
I guess you're like congratulations you paid your bill it's stormy like oh yeah

92
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:19,400
no I figured you meant it was stormy but then I'm thinking to myself that either means

93
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,440
it's gonna come down here or we could go the other way but no a little bit later

94
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,840
it started blowing down here like crazy it's one of those where it blew over the

95
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,800
trash can so I go out in the front yard I pick up the trash because I don't want

96
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,080
the I don't want the studio to look like we're slumming it right so I got there I

97
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,560
pick up the trash can I come back in the wind trolls me blows the trash can over

98
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,000
again well you don't want the studio to look like it's one of those 24-hour news

99
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,080
networks right you want to have a little class here right looking like CNN up in

100
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,600
this business exactly well coming up in this week's episode fedora 21 ship today

101
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,720
Matthew Miller the fedora project lead joins us he talks about the process they

102
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,520
went to to transition to this new multi spin version of fedora also I asked him

103
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,880
to comment on the rumor that fedora is switching to a tick-tock release cycle

104
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,720
and then we also probing for some details and features coming up in fedora 22 so

105
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,120
that's coming up by a little bit in the show also later in the show

106
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,640
Ubuntu snappy core was released today Ubuntu snapper and I'll tell you right

107
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,440
up front it's not for the desktop but I want it on my desktop we're gonna talk

108
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,720
about what snappy is where you can get it what you need to know about it and

109
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,760
where you can find out more information very soon on your local Jupiter

110
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,520
broadcasting network but Matt yes before we get to all that we got to get to some

111
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,920
of our feedback and get going on some of that good stuff we we have a lot of

112
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,880
stuff to cover we have a really great showing in the mumble room today I'm

113
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,560
gonna bring them in here in just a second but before we do that I think

114
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,120
I'll just give like my last emergency plea we are looking for your best of

115
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,880
submissions for Jupiter broadcasting mace mostly kota radio and Linux

116
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,040
unplugged and tech snap at this point last ones are fine too but we got a

117
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,640
whole bunch of those because we want to give the host of the Christmas week off

118
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,960
so that way they can just sit back and relax but we can still have some new

122
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,920
because it's a lot to go through when you have a back catalog as much as we

123
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,480
do so I have a link in the show notes and it's our Jupiter broadcasting best

124
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,160
of submission form we just need the episode title a link to the episode the

125
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,360
time about when it happens and why you liked it in description any other info

126
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,000
you want to give us to help out the network we have a whole bunch of

127
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,060
hardware stuff and software changes going on during that week so the

128
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,680
downtime is gonna be used really well too and I'll be putting out more

129
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,200
information about that on the tech talk today patreon feed okay Matt well let's

130
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,200
get into feedback but before we do that we should say hello and time appropriate

131
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,680
greetings to our awesome mumble room time appropriate greetings guys

132
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:55,280
well we got a great showing today a lot of you I think there's like 300 people

133
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,440
in there not really no I would I think that would crush our server all right

134
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,040
Ubuntu addicted writes in with our first bit of mail and he says my ancient

135
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,840
original Apple TV runs crystal Ubuntu 2.0 crystal Ubuntu was developed by Sam

136
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,960
Nazarocko the same person who brought who brought the world Razz BMC okay

137
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,200
great crystal Ubuntu is based on Ubuntu 12 before which auto launches XBMC

138
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,360
Gotham so I love the show by the way you inspired me to spread Linux and open

139
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,040
source to the masses and he says keep up the great work so Matt he submitted a

140
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,520
photo here boy look at that zoom holy smokes here it is I'm triangulating now

141
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,360
he's got an old old Apple TV like the first gen oh yeah running this crystal

142
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:44,880
Ubuntu spin that goes right into XBMC this got me thinking though looking at

143
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,120
the setup I remember you and I kind of talking about hacking the Apple TV like

144
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,760
it was something like that you know hey you know you could do this this this is

145
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,200
a decent little device you could put XBMC on that was sort of like at the

146
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,560
beginning of 2014 and I'm curious for you if now here we are at the end of 2014

147
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,680
has the Roku killed the XBMC dream for you have you just gone Roku and and

148
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,640
called it a day well so I guess you gotta back up a little bit and realize

149
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,880
that you know I've others in the house that really don't care about the

150
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,880
geekiness of an XBMC setup so for me you know Roku has just been kind of a

151
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,240
natural fit for us it just does the job that will probably change as we explore

152
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,400
new things coming out but at this time yeah yeah for me it was Roku plus plex

153
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,140
yeah exactly it gave me a couple of gave me like three critical things like you

154
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,520
said it had the spousal approval factor which was very high and that remote is

155
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,840
great it's like it's like on the level of Tivo great it's a really good remote

156
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,320
and if you get the Roku 3 it's got the headphone plug so there was that a

157
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,560
spousal approval factor way high plus the price is good I'm gonna include that

158
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,680
in spousal approval factor the other two things though were that plex integration

159
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,480
which gave me resuming play play out playback and centralized metadata for all

160
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,320
of my content very easily and then the third and very important piece was is my

161
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,400
kids can operate it the Roku and the plex together it's simple enough where

162
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,880
it's very it's just straightforward you get in and they can use it and from three

163
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,340
to five they're able to operate this Roku player with with you know full

164
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,560
fluency whereas I that might be possible it probably would be possible with an

165
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,240
XBMC I feel like the simple nature of the Roku though made it more of a

166
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:31,360
possibility Popey what are your thoughts um I don't know I I would love to have

167
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,320
an XBMC box but actually I've been using a Chromecast a lot and a bit of popcorn

168
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,640
time now and then and I I can't motivate myself to build an XBMC box out of

169
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,400
anything really yeah that might be part of what it is too is like things like

170
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,640
the Chromecast and Roku just make it so easy to essentially get what you want

171
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,600
and you know Keller 78 in the chat room says yeah I've got three Roku's one for

172
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,640
myself and two for the family wimpy what are your thoughts on this well I went

173
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,800
the Roku route as well after having a couple of XBMC boxes and I had a Roku in

174
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:09,720
the bedroom and a Roku in the front room and in the last month or so the Roku's

175
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,920
have been replaced by fire TV yeah that's interesting oh I can see myself

176
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,400
going that way too Roku kills XBMC fire TV kills Roku yeah because the the fire

177
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,640
TV does everything the Roku does just faster and a whole lot more besides so

178
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,800
the fire TV has become my gaming in air quotes console in the front room hmm

179
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,720
yeah and this is all happened just in this year all right daredevil and your

180
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,280
final thoughts on this topic unfortunately for me as much as I loved

181
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:46,640
the projects it's like just my TV cable service provider the box they have

182
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,680
actually just just appears as a network device and I can send it any file to it

183
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,400
and shows me on my TVs and it actually makes me easier to exchange files we

184
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,240
do machines and everything so yeah I end up having that news for it yeah all

185
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,120
right I mean that seems reasonable and you know I was just thinking about it

186
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,040
though here in the studio if I got a really nice high-end display in the

187
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,280
living room that maybe I wanted to showcase content for visitors that visit

188
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,720
the studio and things like that I have a suspicion I'd still probably want to go

189
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,600
XBMC there when I want to really make a showpiece I want to have a you know a

190
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,200
really great Jupiter broadcasting experience you know XBMC has we have a

191
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,120
fantastic app right rotten corpse it's really quite good there's a lot of

192
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,280
really good content on XBMC that's great for showcasing on high resolution

193
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,840
displays same with Roku for sure but I just feel like if it was gonna be a

194
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,160
centerpiece I probably would want to go XBMC still so there's still I think a

195
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,920
pretty reasonable space for it well and I would also touch on that and say while

196
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,560
I love the Roku the UI makes me want to scream yeah it's horrible it's it's

197
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,320
really dated and that's where wimpy is coming in with the fire TV because on

198
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,760
the fire TV you get a you get a great hardware rig but you also get that more

199
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:02,480
full-featured Plex Android app that is really pretty good so and it's much

200
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,440
better than them but you know the thing is the Roku one is at least functional

201
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,760
this is true well and it definitely feels like we're kind of entering a

202
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,840
rock-paper-spock situation yeah and it feels like fire TV could be the Spock

203
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,320
move would be you agree that it's a on the fire TV it's really really nailed

204
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,440
it yeah the UI is terrific so if you're just using the remote control which is

205
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,480
almost identical with the number of buttons and the layout to the Roku

206
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,400
remote so super simple but the fire TV has this voice search facility and it's

207
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,760
not like an afterthought and it's not hidden away somewhere and the thing you

208
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,840
might use to sort of show off what it can do the voice search is fronts and

209
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,280
front and center and it's a principal way that you interact with the device

210
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,560
and it works really well and and it feels like the future has arrived when

211
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,400
you when you talk into the remote and then your stuff appears you are selling

212
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:03,160
me on this you know okay so then I think I would be remiss also to 2014 has been

213
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,360
a pretty big year for Netflix and it was even the year we got Netflix on the

214
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,000
Linux desktop and the fact that there's not a really like one-click you know app

215
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,400
install kind of dead simple way to get Netflix integration to XBMC or it's not

216
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,480
even called XBMC anymore but you know what I mean it's it that's also a factor

217
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,180
but rotten corpse I'll let you chime in as the final defender for our beloved

218
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:29,380
media entertainment UI you love it right I love XBMC but I also my bill I work on

219
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,880
add-ons and stuff like that too but the XBMC runs on anything you want it to and

220
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,280
it has like the UI is great by itself in the default one but you can customize

221
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,880
the UI to like hundreds of different options and like a on Knox for example

222
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,040
is beautiful yeah yeah yeah yeah and you got the Raspberry Pi which is a makes a

223
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,440
great to meet advice like I say there is there's still a great world there's

224
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,800
still a great place for it but for me and I thought maybe for man it sounds

225
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,500
like for quite a few folks in the mumble room this has been a year where we

226
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,280
transition more dedicated devices they've maybe finally got it right

227
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,240
actually you could put XBMC on the on the fire TV so you get back to both

228
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,960
worlds yeah so would that be the Android app then or would that be something else

229
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,920
entirely like a firmware yeah it's an Android the Android app that you

230
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,480
sideload and in the Android app for XBMC is a full XBMC interface and

231
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,040
everything so you can load it in so the fire TV wins that's amazing that's

232
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,920
absolutely amazing well now that fire TV is gonna work in 4k because I swear I

233
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,040
want to get a 4k display one of these days I'm skipping 3d Matt I'm going to

234
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,440
4k one day I don't know how to go fourth dimension yeah I'm just gonna I think I

235
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,640
think they're around that same time I'll also be single and living on the street

236
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,320
and your your living room will look a lot like the original enterprise yes it

237
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,160
will though I at least have that all right Matt well we have some really

238
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,680
great feedback to continue including I need to make a serious correction a

239
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,080
mistake on my part and a couple of you know what we're gonna call even an app

240
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,440
pic in unplugged but first I would be remiss if I didn't stop and thank the

241
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,400
folks over at ting go to linux.ting.com that'll take $25 off your first

242
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,880
ting device or if you got a ting compatible device which stay tuned there

243
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,560
could be a lot more of very soon you get a $25 credit so ting is mobile that

244
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,320
makes sense it's no contract no early termination fee and you only pay for

245
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,000
your usage your minutes your messages your megabytes you want to turn on

246
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,160
hotspot and tethering you don't have to have a special share plan or whatever a

247
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,200
smart plan all the plans are the same you just pay for the data usage the

248
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,920
control panel that you manage it and if you ever have any questions they have a

249
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:36,040
no hold customer support but something really crazy crazy exciting is going on

250
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,360
so I want to tell you about it because I think it's going to seriously change

251
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,280
everything before I tell you that though I should probably mention now has been a

252
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,840
really good time to switch because ting has a crazy great deal to get you out of

253
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,200
your your contract if you have an early termination fee an ETF as they call it

254
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,800
in the biz they're gonna pay up to $150 per termination and that's on top of our

255
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,840
$25 credit so you could get months of ting service by taking advantage of this

256
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,320
ETF relief but here's the great news they just announced it a couple of hours

257
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:14,560
ago in 2015 ting is going to start offering GSM network coverage on top of

258
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:20,840
their existing CDMA coverage it is going to be awesome for users like me who have

259
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:27,280
a Nexus 5 and I'll be able to have CDMA and GSM in my freaking Nexus 5 there

260
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,080
they made a really great video for you audio listeners imagine a tech spec

261
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,400
video where they break apart the product you know like when Apple introduced the

262
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,520
Apple watch only it's for the ting sim it's just so awesome I got to play a

263
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,640
little bit of it it's perfect for the occasion

264
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:55,960
the ting sim

265
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,600
and so as you can as you can imagine they're gonna support a lot more devices

266
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,600
and they have the coverage map up now so you can check to see what the coverage

267
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,680
is gonna be like this is gonna be crazy great you're gonna be able to take

268
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,080
advantage of a lot of GSM coverage and a lot of see to make CDMA coverage back to

269
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,160
back you're gonna be able to bring GSM phones over to ting that's gonna open up

270
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,120
a whole new category of devices and right now ting has that early termination

271
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,960
relief program you could go over there you could get yourself a device with

272
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,000
that ETF you could pay you could just grab a feature phone for now if you

273
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,880
wanted to February 2015 ting is gonna be supporting GSM it's a pretty big deal

274
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,040
they really are on a mission to make mobile make sense linux.ting.com go

275
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,320
there to show your support linux.ting.com also give you that $25 credit that's

276
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,800
gonna stack on top of their ETF relief programs it's a great time to switch to

277
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,280
ting linux.ting.com and congratulations to ting on the announcement for GSM in

278
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,240
2015 that's a big deal that is so cool man that is really cool I just it's

279
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,960
gonna be like when I travel now I'm just gonna have the best of both worlds it's

280
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,240
it's really it's really slick okay so I have a make good I got to talk about I

281
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,040
made a I made a mistake when I was talking about Docker last week Philip

282
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,400
wrote in to correct me says hello Chris and crew I just listened to your

283
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,720
reaction upon the announcement of rocket I want to point out that it is actually

284
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,240
possible to host your very own Docker registry where you can host your own

285
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,240
image without having to use the global Docker hub it's not quite as nice as the

286
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,560
global hub since it's essentially only the back end there's no web interface or

287
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,960
search or anything like that and it cannot be hosted in a subdir because the

288
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,480
Docker image name format I currently maintain the AUR package for it I'm

289
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,520
using it every day at my job at a big telco I know it's marked out of date as

290
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,600
soon as I get some time I'll update it and he also has pull requests and he

291
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,240
links to the the AUR Docker registry page that he set up and I wanted to

292
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,600
thank Philip you know because I've actually made the mistake even just as

293
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,560
recently as yesterday in Kota radio I wanted because one of the differences

294
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:03,040
between rocket is a much more federated approach to the to the namespace for app

295
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,160
containers and where its docker is very much doubling down on the Docker hub

296
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,080
centralizing through the Docker service use the Docker API and that contrast

297
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,960
stuck out to me so dramatically that I didn't really consider the fact that

298
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,840
there is this sort of roll your own not super fancy but would certainly work

299
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:23,240
Docker hub for you for your own network so Philip thank you very much for

300
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,240
pointing that out to me man I got it I got like a chest thing going so oh no

301
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,600
that's not good and I'm gonna sip on my coffee a little bit all right so Jesse

302
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,120
writes in and this is on ours this is almost our last email then we'll get to

303
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,680
our interview with Matthew Miller from Fedora Jesse says hello Chris and Matt I

304
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,720
was just wondering what you guys think about the new desktop environment called

305
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,640
moonlight you can currently only build it on arch right now and it uses qt5

306
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,080
it's a fork of LX DE or I'm sorry Alex cutie and he links us to the home page

307
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,840
which I have linked to the show notes I was running what you thought of this QT

308
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,320
desktop that's just yet another desktop for the Raspberry Pi or PC in a way this

309
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,560
may be a sign that GTK two or three is dying and it is the rise of QT so which

310
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,760
is cool maybe we'll get some more themes now so here it is it's called the

311
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,080
moonlight desktop a project that aims create a desktop environment mainly for

312
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,840
those who run on low performance devices anybody heard of moonlight have we

313
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,200
talked about moonlight I think we've touched on it a little bit I I'm not

314
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,680
uber familiar with it but then I'm pretty happy with what I got now yeah q5

315
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,360
is our Raspberry Pi guy and he's not in here right now but I wonder if he's

316
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,880
heard of moonlight I'll ask him when we get off air so anyways if you're

317
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,360
curious at no canoe org slash moonlight de but wimpy you have are you familiar

318
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,760
with it yeah yeah I've come across it in circles and I did take a look but I

319
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,600
don't think it's had any commit since sort of the end of September so well I

320
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:51,600
know I don't know if it was like a summer project or attention is 2013 on

321
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,920
the bottom of their page that jumped out of me when I saw that yeah nine months

322
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,600
ago looks like three months ago here's a here's a more recent commit three months

323
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,840
ago so I don't know maybe they're looking for help could be could be

324
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,200
there's there's been no recent get activity yeah all right Matt Jim wrote

325
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,000
in I think it was on the just on the live stream I don't remember if it was

326
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,620
actually in a show or not but you and I were sort of grousing that we missed some

327
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,560
of the old nice just simple down-to-business interface elements of

328
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:24,320
Winamp you remember that yes oh my gosh yes so Jay Lim writes in he says I

329
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,800
remember a few weeks ago when you and Matt were wishing for a small Winamp

330
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,040
like player for Linux a few people wrote in but I forgot to mention it's called

331
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,560
audacious it's an awesome music player now at first audacious doesn't look

332
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,800
anything like Winamp but it has everything and more but you can add a

333
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,720
skin with a dockable EQ and playlist manager just like you did back in the

334
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,240
day and Matt's all in the AUR so here for those of you watching the video

335
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,800
version I do have it installed like in if I like if I play I'm playing a little

336
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,080
track right now and it does the visualization and with the timecode with

337
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:57,600
the scrolling track name this is a theme that I installed from the AUR and it is

338
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,000
exactly like Winamp with no like yeah it's it's fun so audacious is a good one

339
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,100
so thank you to who was it let's see go back up here up to a jail J lim for

340
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,040
sending that in audacious and it's a make good it's something I've been

341
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,000
meaning to pick for a while but I just never get around to it I thought we

342
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,600
might have made mention to audacious before but I wanted to give it an

343
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,640
official plug now that yeah I saw this theme and I installed that thought I'd

344
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,600
give you a chance to check it out so it's very cool see audacious sweet

345
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:30,360
audacious music player okay just as good yeah audaciously good that's that's good

346
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,040
Matt I like that you should give that to him what's going on over there kids and

347
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,440
kitty what's going on over there alright so why don't we take a quick break and

348
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,320
then we're gonna we're gonna go talk to Matthew let's uh let's mention right

00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,520
server you can get rolling real easy real quick go check it out users can

354
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,800
create a cloud server in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans start at only

355
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:08,680
five dollars per month for 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a

356
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,400
terabyte of transfer and DigitalOcean has fantastic data centers multiple

357
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,540
data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and London the

358
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:21,080
interface to let you choose between them is super cool too boy I should just like

359
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,240
go through the process of creating a droplet right now because it's that quick

360
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:28,120
and easy and Matt we've always talked about using DigitalOcean to easily

361
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,920
deploy a WordPress droplet absolutely I've been getting a lot of

362
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,680
recommendations to check out ghost which is a newer blogging platform yes and

363
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:42,000
DigitalOcean again one click install you deploy it it's really easy it's really

364
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,120
slick so I think on top of on top of the great interface on top of the

365
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,600
performance on top of the flexibility where you can put the droplets they've

366
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,440
also got an API that lets you get even deeper into that so their interface is

367
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,520
super intuitive their control panel is awesome but there's a lot of tools now

368
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,200
built around the DigitalOcean API like to snap it into puppet to do management

369
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,240
to just write scripts to just restart them remotely from your applet menu bar

370
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,720
a lot of take snapshots before you go do an update like this is really cool like

371
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,840
your SSH 10 you're about to do something crazy just go up to your menu bar

372
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,080
snapshot exactly and I do that all the time because I'm always doing something

373
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,720
crazy oh yeah and they're also they're paying now for tutorials because they

374
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,680
really want to have some of the best tutorials on the web so go over to

375
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:28,640
DigitalOcean.com use our promo code unplug December all one word lowercase

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,960
that's gonna give you a $10 credit you can try out the $5 droplet for two

377
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,040
months for free why not seriously check out ghost a lot of people have

378
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,800
recommended as an awesome blogging platform and there's some really great

379
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,480
free themes that I talked about in yesterday's Koda radio you can go grab

380
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,960
those it's a great way to display photos or just do text only stuff or journals

381
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,320
it looked really cool and you just one click boom you've got it up on

382
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,520
DigitalOcean and since they're paying for those tutorials they've got the best

383
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,360
tutorials and deploying ghost is one of them in fact they're gonna pay up to

384
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,000
$200 we've got a link in the show notes DigitalOcean.com and a big thank you

385
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,480
DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux unplugged all right so we're gonna talk

386
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,600
with Matthew Miller he's the lead of the Fedora project Fedora 21 came out today

387
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,200
to congratulations to them this is a big one a lot of stuff but this was the

388
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,960
first release after they've refactored the way the distribution is done in the

389
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,080
multiple spins and so we brought on Matthew on the Linux action show on

390
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:33,640
Sunday and we pre-recorded this interview with him for today's show okay

391
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,640
yep so it'll be an it'll be not just for a little while all right very good well

392
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,040
here we go and I see two lights we would all right so this is for Linux unplugged

393
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,240
and I'm gonna start in three in two I started by asking him how the team and

394
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,560
how he's doing after such a major release and refactoring yeah first I

395
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:56,400
want to step back and say thank you to everybody who worked on Fedora and the

396
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,920
computers because it really this is an amazing release and so many people put

397
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,640
work into making it so you know I said it's at the top of the project but it

398
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,400
doesn't it's not quite a project where it's top-down I want to make sure

399
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:17,960
everybody gets there right of course yeah lots and especially I mean really

400
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,000
for this release too because this is now the release with them different types of

401
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,400
spins I mean the project in between releases went through a pretty dramatic

402
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,060
change in how it does development right yeah absolutely we've done a really good

403
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:35,240
job I think of spinning up work especially in the cloud and server areas

404
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,760
where we had a little bit lack of direction and focus there so it wasn't

405
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,960
easy for people to plug into it so now we have these new working groups which

406
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,240
kind of sort of an attachment point for people who are interested and those have

407
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,280
really taken off in a positive way yeah so if I'm new to Linux maybe I know we

408
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,960
run some reddit enterprise servers at my work or something like that I'm looking

409
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,400
at Fedora workstation do I need to be a little afraid that it's too complicated

410
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:06,040
for a new user no you do not so one of the things we are really focusing on

411
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:11,000
through our workstation is being targeting software developers as the

412
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,720
focus but software developers are generally human beings as well most of

413
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:25,640
you know I know some they're questionable really they need to have

414
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,760
some access to power user kind of things but the basic desktop needs to be slick

415
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,000
and get out of the way and so we think that the gnome desktop that our

416
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,400
workstation is based on is really great at doing that and it's really easy for

417
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:44,280
new users as well Fedora as a fast-moving distribution with a lot of

418
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:50,080
updates and things like that sometimes you have to be a new user who's really

419
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,160
willing to learn and adjust and figure things out so I think that it's not

420
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:01,320
necessarily something I would put on a new user who's off on an island

421
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,840
somewhere but a new user who's interested in learning and has technical

422
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:10,280
friends well I when I look at Fedora too I think there's a category of users out

423
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,720
there that I don't think we talked about enough in the Linux community and that

424
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,680
is guys like my friend Chase who have been maybe Windows admins for ten years

425
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,920
there you know they have a totally tricked out Windows install with

426
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,800
customizations and you know special drive like they deep dive into Windows

427
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,080
as far as you can deep dive so when when he was switching to Linux he actually

428
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,920
wanted a Linux he could tinker with because that's one of the things he does

429
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,160
and so I think Fedora for the for the users that are very comfortable with

430
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,400
their computers it's like a slam dunk but the one thing that you mentioned to

431
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,080
us on Sunday's Linux action show which really resonated with me because it's

432
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,200
something we've talked about on Linux unplugged a lot is you're also hoping to

433
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,800
reclaim some of those users who've switched over to MacBooks right

434
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,920
even a Linux conference these days and you've got people who are doing cloud

435
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:59,480
development and they've got the MacBook on there on their lab basically they're

436
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:05,080
sitting in the audience not paying attention to the speaker we'd like to

437
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:09,440
get those people back to running Linux as much as now but here's my here's the

438
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,120
one to punch to that is there anything the Fedora project could do to make

439
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,640
Linux not suck so bad on MacBooks like there I hear there's constant Wi-Fi

440
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,240
issues sometimes there's issues starting the eyesight camera no Thunderbolt

441
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,640
DisplayPort the Thunderbolt Ethernet adapter only works if it's connected

442
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,580
when the MacBook boots it's a very clunky experience but it's pretty well

443
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,600
respected hardware is there anything Fedora could do to maybe actually focus

444
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,920
on that so I know that some of our people on our desktop team and and I

445
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:44,960
know also at Red Hat people who are paid to work on the desktop are have some

446
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,680
contacts they're working on that at Apple and I don't know all the details

447
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,480
on that but we do really try to make that work but you know it's hard when

448
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,040
you're working with no documentation no source for any of that stuff that

449
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,480
manages it I know but it seems like we've overcome larger challenges before

450
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,760
but let's let's talk about another challenge that so while Fedora 21 is in

451
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,760
development this started happening before Fedora 21 went into development

452
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,320
but it seems like the container space went red-hot just super hot during the

453
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,280
Fedora 21 development cycle so not only is the team shifting gears for this new

454
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:25,440
spin style release cycle and development model but at the same time a big

455
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,880
underlying piece of Linux technology is really changing you have systemd which

456
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,080
is coming in at the same time you've got containers which is there's a lot of

457
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,880
movement there is is that a lot for a project that's in progress like Fedora

458
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,280
right now to address or was that just was that rolled in during the development

459
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:49,120
cycle was it a challenge talk a little bit about ongoing challenge I think it's

460
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,040
certain it also is it's the future of the operating system sure yeah seems

461
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:59,920
like yeah and so in Fedora one of the things we're doing is we have in the on

462
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,880
the cloud flavor of the new Fedora you'll see a thing called Fedora atomic

463
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,700
and this is basically a host image in the current incarnation meant to run in

464
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:14,360
cloud providers like OpenStack or an Amazon EC2 meant to run Docker

465
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:20,480
containers so it has basically tools for doing that and nothing else it uses a

466
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,680
thing called RPM OS tree so it has a sort of an image based version of the

467
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:31,360
base OS and then you run your Docker containers on top of that and I think

468
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:36,880
we're going to be iterating a lot on that over the next release cycles it's

469
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,840
going to be a big thing and so I think that right now we can have that off in

470
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:46,240
the corner of the cloud space which is where that I think the energy around

471
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,220
that is mostly focused but there's a proposal for Fedora 22 to make it

472
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:56,160
available on bare hardware bare metal as well and kind of expand that out and I

473
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,160
think we'll see that kind of across all the different flavors of Fedora

474
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:05,120
increasingly so I guess is so kind of is what your answer is there is project

475
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,540
atomic which is a very which is a really interesting container management

476
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:13,320
solution is sort of being developed first on Fedora yeah you know it's one

477
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,360
of these things that's moving so fast that it's hard to know where it's all

478
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:23,120
going yeah especially when we're looking at kind of the more forward-reaching

479
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,840
kind of things in you know how is this really going to impact how we put the

480
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,040
whole operating system together we want to look at Fedora as a space we're

481
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:35,360
experimenting with that and so we I know we've also have people who are looking

482
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:42,040
at containerized desktop which is another one so containerized apps are

483
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:46,160
obviously a really nice thing to have if you're having a desktop especially if

484
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,160
third-party apps that may be questionable or you know even first

485
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,520
party apps that you just don't want to I don't know which party I should count

486
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,480
there but you know you don't you don't want to put so much effort into because

487
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,280
it just takes a lot of time to package these things up so you can if you put it

488
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,800
into a container you can feel a little bit better about doing the worst job for

489
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:12,240
kind of edge of the operating system and so there's a lot of appeal to doing that

490
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,440
but containerizing desktop apps is a lot harder than containerizing server apps

491
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,240
which are sort of meant usually communicating over a network port and

492
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,360
that's what they do maybe some other in a process communication whereas desktop

493
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:30,760
apps are kind of used to being able to access you know the hardware access you

494
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,840
dropping files wherever reading files forever and so that's gonna be a lot

495
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,200
more work how how important do you think all of this is the container management

496
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,080
and containers themselves how important do you think that being successful and

497
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:48,640
will implement it is critical to Fedora being considered a production candidate

498
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,000
ready server OS because I think a lot of people right now don't consider Fedora

499
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,240
a server grade OS they'd probably rather go with CentOS scientific Linux

500
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,360
Red Hat Enterprise Linux itself and not necessarily Fedora but it sounds like

501
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,920
these kinds of changes are maybe an attempt to get people to change their

502
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,640
minds so are these a critical part of that well I think we've actually always

503
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:14,640
had a lot of people who have been used used Fedora even in production on large

504
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:21,520
scale server they tend to not talk about it so much I could believe but yeah it's

505
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,720
not on the scale that CentOS and Ural and the big enterprise distributions are

506
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,840
and that that makes sense because it kind of fits into if you look on the

507
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,960
technology adoption curve kind of thing we're you know way over in the

508
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,520
innovators and maybe some the early adopter kind of space and that's just a

509
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:44,560
much smaller segment and you know with CentOS in the long tail there there's

510
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,720
there's gonna be a lot more there and especially if you want to set up a

511
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,600
server and you know not worry about it for ten years right or it's not your

512
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:57,120
best choice for that but we want to make sure that we fit into the ecosystem in

513
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:02,000
places where it makes sense where you have it there's advantages in having the

514
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,080
newest versions of things if you are able if it's no problem to upgrade every

515
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:13,220
year like okay I want to keep the latest so I'm following that it's there and of

516
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:18,720
course people who have been following Fedora and making sure that they run it

517
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,880
in some corner of their infrastructure are not surprised when rel7 comes out

518
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:29,440
yes you know they not everything that goes into Fedora goes into rel it's a

519
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,760
you know downstream relationship that isn't always completely direct like that

520
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,560
but we try to make sure that everything goes into rel right yeah so if we can

521
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,300
get more people who are running rel and CentOS running Fedora it'll be better

522
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:50,080
for them and it also of course benefits our downstream distributions because

523
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:56,760
they get the feedback from Fedora users early and I think you know there's as

524
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:04,600
systemd finally got into rel7 and people were surprised I think that actually you

525
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:09,120
know we've had it in Fedora for several releases and got a lot of polish and a

526
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:14,160
lot of things that were it would have been it right made it much smoother oh

527
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,960
yeah yeah so it really really made it go much smoother there I think we kind of

528
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,960
we're gonna have as the container nation and all these things change the

529
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,640
operating system more and more we're gonna have more of that yeah so yeah

530
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:31,120
well so as I hate to do this to you as we are sitting on the release day I hate

531
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,920
to be the guy to ask what's next but you must be looking forward to Fedora 22 a

532
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,040
little bit and have a few low-hanging fruits that you want to pick and

533
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,400
something that you want to work into Fedora 22 what's what's in front of mind

534
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:50,080
for you yeah so after having a one-year cycle here of going back to the six

535
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,080
month cycle it's already like wow it's gonna be fast because we're looking at a

536
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,560
May release date which means working back you know from the betas and the

537
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,360
alphas and things like that that means that our feature work basically needs to

538
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:14,520
be done at the end of January so I think that there are some things that are

539
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,000
gonna be changes but I don't think that there's gonna be a lot of radical change

540
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,760
in order to it's going to be incremental on some of these things we talked about

541
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,240
I've heard some scuttlebutt of maybe refactoring the release cycle to what

542
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,760
people are calling a tick-tock release cycle to do you have any comments on

543
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,480
that yeah we just started kind of talking about that and that's sort of

544
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,100
the idea that we would one release concentrate on sort of the

545
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:42,240
infrastructure and the QA and release engineering tooling and then the next

546
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,080
release focus on the features that go into it and we're still working out that

547
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:52,040
conversation some people really like it some people feel like it would hold back

548
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,500
I think one of the concerns I saw is somebody said well would that mean maybe

549
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,720
like the talk release wouldn't see the latest version of gnome brought in it

550
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,080
would still have the release from the tick

551
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,240
the desktop people both gnome and KDE which is one of our other alternate

552
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,200
desktops that we consider very important they don't like that at all they want to

553
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,240
make sure their software gets in the hands of users very quickly so I think

554
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,760
even if we went to this kind of model we would do it in a soft sort of way so

555
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,640
where the releases that focus on the infrastructure would still allow new

556
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,920
things to come in as long as they don't get in the way of that and a lot of

557
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,680
those things like a new gnome release probably don't as much get in the way

558
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:40,400
okay right so something to watch and it sounded like an interesting idea and I

559
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,720
could see some some serious benefits to it so yeah so that so might that be

560
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,520
introduced during the fedora 22 release cycle or would that be a post 22 thing

561
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:55,920
I think that the conversation right now it's probably a post 22 thing and one of

562
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,880
the reasons for that actually is that just because as we're seeing running

563
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,960
into the holidays now it would be very advantageous for the feature cycle to be

564
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,520
the spring cycle and the infrastructure cycle to be the fall one

565
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,080
likely to be disruptive so we're kind of on the wrong cadence if that's what we

566
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:18,200
want to do right so having another release to talk about it is probably a

567
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:23,960
good idea especially since it's a big decision yeah before fedora 22 expanded

568
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,200
for atomic and more container stuff is going to be a big theme possibly even

569
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,920
some test containerized stuff for workstation although I don't know how

570
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:39,120
far that's going to go there's some talk of that there's a switch in the

571
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:45,200
package manager level there's a thing called DNF yes it's likely to become the

572
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:52,320
default replacing yum okay so it uses the hockey back end different from a

573
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,360
technical level the depth solver is different and it should be a lot faster

574
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:01,440
as well and more importantly from a development point of view although

575
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,040
users don't necessarily care it has a much cleaner design and a better API so

576
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,720
it will be more maintainable for the future that's exciting awesome yeah all

577
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,080
right well for now everybody can go enjoy fedora 21 it should be out a mirror

578
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:20,320
near you or a torrent near you as well

579
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,880
fedora org and also we'll have links to some of your social profiles in the

580
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:30,000
show notes anything else you want to touch on before we run I think that's

581
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,960
it for now this is gonna be a great release so I think you all enjoy it and

582
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,440
again thanks to everybody who worked on it yeah yeah I'll echo that great work

583
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,920
to everybody on the Fedora team this is this is a solid release and a real

584
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,320
screamer too at least on my rig so I'm pretty happy with it well thanks again

585
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,680
Matthew and congratulations thank you

586
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,480
and if everything goes as planned on Sunday's Linux action show we're gonna

587
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,640
break down the different specific spins and really deep dive into each one of

588
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,960
them individually and talk about talk about that and it should be if

589
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,620
everything goes as planned like I say because it's a live production it should

590
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,920
be a live panel of fedora experts that will be helping us with that I don't

591
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,240
want to say anymore just that way nobody's on the hook but it should be a

592
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,400
really great episode so expanded coverage in Sunday's Linux action show

593
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:23,400
hey mumble room why don't we do a community review of fedora 21 next week

594
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,800
on Linux unplugged so as many of you that are willing give it a spin ideally

595
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,040
on on hardware but a VM if that's what you can do would also be great fedora

596
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:37,120
21 I mean I'm I already have the gnome version installed I'm actually gonna do

597
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,920
a fresh install just to sort of start over clean cuz I was really having some

598
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,120
fun experimenting with all the different repositories and messing around with how

599
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:50,200
far I could push the Nuvu driver but so if you would join us next and also I

600
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,400
this is an open invitation to anybody listening that's not in the mumble room

601
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,040
right now you can join us next Tuesday we start at 2 p.m. Pacific go to Jupiter

602
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:02,160
broadcasting comm slash calendar for the live time in your local area you can

603
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,680
join us in the mumble room it's an open mumble room we'll just do a mic check

604
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,960
make sure you're not crazy or something I don't know and then we'll bring in and

605
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,920
talk about fedora 21 as a group and see what everybody thinks this is this is

606
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,200
supposed to be kind of our bag right fedora workstation that's right supposed

607
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,280
to be kind of be for the power users that's kind of us so let's see what I

608
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:25,800
think and I hope that is I hope as many of you can give it a go and I'll give

609
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,800
you my I'll give you my thoughts too and then on Sunday join us for even more

610
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,320
coverage alright so guys any thoughts on fedora 21 in the mumble room today it's

611
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,360
release day before we move on change topics sounds interesting and appears

612
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:42,560
that everyone is I fortunately everyone is now starting to look on making a good

613
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,640
developer experience which may render in good apps yeah isn't that kind of

614
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,120
exciting like the fact that you know he touched on that really made sure like

615
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,440
that we want to make it good for developers we want to make it you know

616
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,320
attractive to those MacBook switchers which that's a topic that kernel Linux

617
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,360
has brought up a few times on this show when we go to these conferences is that

618
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:05,520
it's a it's a sea of MacBooks and you kind of walk away and you go wow it

619
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,160
feels like everybody's on max what are we all doing am I the only one that's

620
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,480
doing this on the Linux desktop and then you know some of them have it installed

621
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,940
but a lot of them don't if you can make something compelling for them and he

622
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,840
says that they might even be end up talking with Apple that'd be pretty

623
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:23,920
great kits and what do you think so I'm on their website and I noticed that

624
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:29,080
under the workstation link it says user friendly but he's also talking about

625
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:35,160
focusing developers isn't there a little bit of dichotomy between the two I think

626
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,120
he means those are their users so it's friendly to them I think it's I think

627
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,520
what they're actually kind of doing is by saying it's developer focused it's an

628
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:47,000
acknowledgement in a sense that there is a barrier of entry and we're saying

629
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,320
developer because that is a label that we prescribe to something of a certain

630
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,320
level of knowledge but what it really means is if you're competent in some

631
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,560
level of system administration and configuration and doing a little bit of

632
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,880
research really maybe this is another caveat right what it's another way of

633
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,880
saying is if you're kind of good at googling and you know how to figure out

634
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,320
how to fix stuff on your own and figure out their own solution through googling

635
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,280
then this is a good desktop for you and they're not mutually exclusive either

636
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,780
being user friendly doesn't mean developer hostile and being developer

637
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:19,920
friendly doesn't mean user hostile it can be friendly to both right yeah yeah

638
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,760
for sure and that's pretty important if you can't get the developer to feel

639
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:32,400
comfortable it's hard to feel any user yeah that's yes all right so I'll give

640
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,760
you more thoughts on Sunday and on Tuesday 21 is the release I've been

641
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,800
looking forward to for a really long time because I you know I already said

642
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,920
this on Sunday and I know I'm kind of repeating myself I'm sorry but I'm

643
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,040
really excited it is really them trying to address some of the criticism I think

644
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,480
that we've given them over the years not I'm not saying they did it because of us

645
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,280
but I'm just saying it to me it seems to be focusing them more specifically

646
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,280
something we've said they've lacked and they're doing it a really interesting

647
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,560
time and they're going to do it in a really competitive way and I think

648
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:05,120
Matthew Miller is is also a really good leader I mean he's really good at

649
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,000
communicating he also runs the fedora magazine he's extremely good at

650
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,640
publishing relevant information the new get fedora website is really useful and

651
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:17,200
he's he's obviously very well at working with the podcasts and the community to

652
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,800
get the word out there it's exactly what the fedora project is needed so they got

653
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,280
the technology aspect of it right and I think they've got the community aspect

654
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,920
of it right too so they're really I think they're firing all cylinders and I

655
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,960
think I think and I would assume 22 is just gonna be even better but I'll save

656
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:38,680
my thoughts for another show so before we go on to Ubuntu snappy or I guess

657
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:43,520
maybe the technical term is Ubuntu snappy core which boy this is this has

658
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,920
been an interesting couple of weeks in the space I want to tell you about

659
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,840
Linux Academy though Linux Academy is your resource to go better yourself on

660
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:53,480
your own time and on your own rules at your own schedule for your own purposes

661
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,680
maybe it's a challenge yourself to see if you still got it like I like to do

662
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,280
from time to time maybe it's to just check another box off on that yearly

663
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,920
review this is yes I went and I took some education or maybe she gets

664
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,960
certified in something new something to make you even more employable Linux

665
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:13,160
Academy comm slash unplugged go there to get our 33% discount when you get that

666
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,760
discount and I recommend you go there because you're gonna want to keep Linux

667
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,120
Academy service once you get it once you get that discount you get that 33% off

668
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:24,320
you get all all acts you get access to all of the content all of it and all of

669
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,600
the new stuff that they add I got an email here from Linux Academy they say

670
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,320
they just launched their puppet professional certification preparation

671
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:36,600
course this course can take you from zero absolutely no puppet knowledge to

672
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,400
a certified ready-to-go puppet technician they've launched two new

673
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,280
courses one on Docker which is talk about great timing for that and one on

674
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,800
vagrant which is an excellent tool in the past 30 days they have added over a

675
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,400
hundred videos a hundred new practice exams tailored practice exams by people

676
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,960
that genuinely know the content that's the huge differentiator here the entire

677
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,240
site is run by Linux enthusiasts they fundamentally have it from that approach

678
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:05,400
which you know that makes all of the difference they've got video streams

679
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,240
they're doing all the time now too which you can interact and ask questions

680
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,800
directly to the educator step-by-step video courses downloadable comprehensive

681
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,200
study guides you can pick from seven plus Linux distributions and they

682
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:17,440
automatically adjust the courseware they'll spin up virtual servers for you

683
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,080
on-demand give you access over SSH public boom you can put DNS on there you

684
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:25,480
can do scenario based deployments of bind or all kinds of services Amazon AWS

685
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:30,360
it's a fantastic service and it's it's one of these where you can go in there

686
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,480
and say I'm a very busy person I mean I really don't have a lot of time but I I

687
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,200
can take advantage of Linux Academy you can go in there you can say I have this

688
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,760
much time available then the learning plan will create courseware for you

689
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,840
based on that availability and it does a good job keeping you motivated keeping

690
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:51,240
you involved sending you reminders about quizzes it's it's such a great resource

691
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:56,080
Linux Academy comm slash unplugged go save a little bit of money and I'm not

692
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,720
gonna I'm not gonna use the New Year's resolution line but think about it just

693
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:03,000
saying it's probably a pretty good idea to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

694
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,680
and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux unplugged show all

695
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,000
right so a Popey's here but he swears up and down he's gonna he's not going to

696
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,280
talk to me about Ubuntu snappy right Popey not gonna happen

697
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:21,880
about it then yeah maybe I would understand no I actually and Dustin

698
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,640
Kirkland right is that is that his last name yeah yeah he's a canonicals cloud

699
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,760
storage solutions product manager and he's the leading technical product

700
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,720
strategy roadmap and lifecycle for the Ubuntu cloud commercial offerings he's

701
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,120
gonna join us on Sunday's Linux action show cool so that's the horse's mouth so

702
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:41,560
what we get to do right now is tell you what what it is and why I think it's

703
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:45,960
kind of a neat deal assuming I don't lose my voice before the end of the show

704
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,080
so Mark Shuttleworth and a bunch of other people today announced it I

705
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,720
actually have the video you know I'll play it I'll play just a quick just a

706
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,760
quick little bit of it I won't play the whole thing there I'll just jump I'll

707
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,720
jump ahead a little bit where Mark is talking about what it is so he never

708
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:07,840
break the device so what Mark does your applications that are super fresh today

709
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:11,920
he compares how they've developed a firmware like approach for the phone OS

710
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,200
where they can deliver updates to the base OS that are don't break and if it

711
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,380
does break there's a built-in recovery mechanism that don't touch the

712
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,200
application space they don't change the state information the application data

713
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,960
just like Android and iOS updates these applications instantly available to

714
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:30,520
users all over the world and to make sure that updates to the applications

715
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:35,840
are also transactional and bulletproof and you can try that out today take any

716
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,400
of our supported devices put Ubuntu on that device and then watch how

717
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:46,920
incredibly easy it is to update that device it feels like you're on rails so

718
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:50,520
going back okay so this is sort of the basic idea of what they want to deliver

719
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:55,000
with Ubuntu snappy now you might maybe remember Wimpy what was it called

720
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:01,640
Ubuntu juice the that's like super small Ubuntu core yeah right for geos geos

721
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:06,800
yes right now that that was sort of a maybe an early go at this when

722
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,560
virtualization was really you were gonna do all of your scaling through

723
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:15,760
virtualization which still happens but you really wanted the most base tiny

724
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,800
operating system for the host and then you just put all your stuff in the

725
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,480
virtual machines well now there's kind of a new approach where it's you kind of

726
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:27,840
the same idea but with containers and the idea here is you keep a really

727
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,080
minimal base operating system that's actually even as maybe could be read

728
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:36,560
only and then you deliver all of the applications inside Docker containers

729
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:41,280
and and the developers can publish those Docker container updates directly so

730
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,160
we've talked recently about how the own cloud project is a little miffed that

731
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:48,020
when you do apt install own cloud on Debbie and stable it's like a two or

732
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:52,320
three year old version of own cloud and it's not supported as real bad bugs it

733
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:56,160
makes them look bad they don't like that they would be self-publishing these

734
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,020
Docker containers and these would just slide right on top of a Ubuntu snap you

735
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:04,920
release that base OS is more like a firmware update where you use snap in a

736
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:10,040
new version of that base OS and there's a rollback there's a transactional

737
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:13,240
rollback if it doesn't work and the applications you know your own cloud

738
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:16,400
instance your WordPress instance your whatever that are all you know your

739
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,240
database all in these different Docker containers just like your smartphone

740
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,000
apps today don't they don't get really affected by the underlying operating

741
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
system being updated it's kind of like you know what core OS is going for and

742
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,080
it's not a you know it's it's it's a buntus take on it right guys so far

743
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:36,360
anybody want to fact check me I'm kind of getting all this right so you so the

744
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:42,400
the applications can take advantage of new features in updates so the

745
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:48,720
underlying read-only image that you that updates periodically might have new

746
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,720
features landing in it and that's defined by a framework and so an

747
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:58,560
application can say I I can use framework 1.0 or framework 2.0 there's

748
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:03,720
a feature platform aspect exactly that's something that was taken straight from

749
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:07,760
the phone so the phone has the same concept of framework so an application

750
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,800
that says I can only work on 1504 and above will just not be visible in the

751
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:18,480
store to anyone on a previous framework so you could see how this is a really

752
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:24,560
interesting approach to almost solving the rolling problem the applications are

753
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,520
updated maybe by the vendors or by the administrator in their own container the

754
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,340
base operating system you know it could be a nice stable LTS that just gets

755
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:37,920
features added on by the upstream vendor in this case canonical it's a it's a

756
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:44,280
very like a sealed off hypoallergenic like kind of like yeah approach to to a

757
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,680
Linux server any reactions in the mumble room William do you have any thoughts on

758
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:55,160
this I just want to see it happen all right that's one of those things that I

759
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:01,280
feel that they gotta try it kids and kitty what are your thoughts yeah I had

760
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,040
asked actually during the pre-show if this was the end product of all those

761
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,520
rumors that we're going through going rolling if this is the actual

762
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:15,920
manifestation of that well it's kind of it's kind of part of it in on the

763
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,640
server side and on the phone side you know arguably the phone is is somewhat

764
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:27,120
rolling in that we can send out a new system update image and developers can

765
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:31,580
put their new apps in the store for the phone the same thing happens for Ubuntu

766
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:36,560
core in the cloud so in the cloud will deploy a new version of the the read

767
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,160
only snappy image and the developer the own cloud developer in this case or

768
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:46,000
WordPress or Hadoop or whatever it is will update theirs and so it gets close

769
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,600
to rolling I mean it's not because there's still gates on all of those

770
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:55,080
things but it's it's a lot closer to rolling than every six months for

771
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:59,440
example and you end up with a server in the cloud with your deployment on that

772
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,400
you've got to think carefully about which bits you upgrade you know it makes

773
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,040
me think though and wimpy I'd be curious to get your insights on this I like look

774
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:11,960
at the Ubuntu Mate edition wouldn't it if you could start like if this Ubuntu

775
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,320
snappy you know it's been out for a while it's something you could build on

776
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:21,040
top of you think by the way by the way systemd based Ubuntu snappy right it's

777
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:28,000
systemd first server cloud version of Ubuntu that will use systemd heyo if you

778
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,720
could take Ubuntu Mate and and base it on sort of this base system where

779
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:36,440
components of your distribution are containers that ship on top of it and

780
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:41,000
when a new release of Mate comes out you would just ship out a new container to

781
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,480
your end users wimpy are you driving with this is this something you've

782
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,160
thought about it is something I've thought about and not just as a result

783
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:56,280
of this Ubuntu core release but also from Lennox proposal for namespaced

784
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:02,200
sub volumes and shipping a thin OS which you then provide libraries and

785
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:09,520
applications as sub volume overlays and if you think about it as the upstream

786
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:15,720
desktop developers so you could say the Marte development team or the gnome team

787
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:20,880
or KDE or any of the others they are package managers in their own right

788
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:26,000
because all of the components that make up those desktops come with configure

789
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,840
scripts where you can do configure make make install and that is essentially all

790
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:38,240
you need to build these overlay type systems and certainly it would make it

791
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:43,880
much easier for the application developers and much faster for the

792
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:48,960
application developers to ship their desktop environments their applications

793
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:54,040
in that sort of paradigm I mean the snappy is Ubuntu snappy core is

794
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:58,800
premiering on Microsoft Azure why because in their own words Microsoft

795
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:03,560
loves Linux they say but so it's clearly this is targeted for the server but I

796
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,360
I'm like okay that's neat I'll just be sitting over here eating my popcorn

797
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,760
waiting for the desktop implementation of this because this honestly sounds like

798
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,080
how I want my desktop I want a nice really stable core base that gives baby

799
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:17,560
platform features that sound like like Popeye was talking about but I want my

800
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:21,800
apps like I want my core set of applications fresh and rolling right

801
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,560
well we've already said we're going to do that for the we're going to bring the

802
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:31,320
technology that's in the phone to the desktop with unity 8 and siloed

803
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:35,560
applications and app armor and all the kinds of things and the click store and

804
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,120
click packages all the kinds of things are on the phone we'll bring that to the

805
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:42,760
desktop but over the next couple of years this kind of leapfrogs all of that

806
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:47,320
straight to the cloud I think because it's just easier and the time is right

807
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:52,040
for it I mean you mentioned earlier about juice and Ubuntu core from 804 I

808
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:57,160
think they're a bit ahead of the time back then and now it seems the time is

809
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:01,680
right what with core OS and Docker and the popularity of all of that I agree it

810
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,520
does seem like the the right time and I think that's why honestly when Mark was

811
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,440
on the Linux action show a couple of weeks ago I specifically asked him about

812
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,240
core OS because it seemed like it was filling a hole that Ubuntu didn't have a

813
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:18,880
plug for yet and this is sort of their take on it but I wonder if it it to me

814
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,320
seems like it has some clear advantages to start in the cloud number one

815
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,840
canonical has a pretty good track record there now they have already a really

816
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,000
strong deployment so there's a lot of stuff built around that the place you

817
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,920
have a significant portion of canonicals businesses is built around supporting

818
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,640
that so it's important to them so there it's a good bet if you're making from an

819
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:39,440
enterprise standpoint if you're betting on that product but also you have to

820
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,000
figure that there's a lot of users that are going to just easily transition and

821
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,720
I was starting to wonder if maybe Ubuntu was gonna sort of turn into a bit of a

822
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:51,720
runtime that like would be deployed on top of things like core OS you know

823
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,760
it'd be the runtime that the Docker container actually used but now this

824
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:57,720
this sort of prevents that from happening where a shop that would still

825
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,600
be using Ubuntu in the container sort of the Ubuntu runtime could now actually

826
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,440
also be using Ubuntu on the base and I think that's this came out a time before

827
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,920
that bleeding even begun so the timing of it's really good there so anyways I

828
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:13,280
think Ubuntu snap is it's cool for the server I want it for the desktop already

829
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,440
I mean screw right same here just stop just stop it just move it over the

830
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,000
desktop get get a get a gnome container set up get a get a chrome container

831
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:25,760
whatever it takes just get all that and I'll use that make it so right so we'll

832
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,720
get more information about that soon any closing thoughts on that mumble room

833
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:36,320
before we run anybody have any pontificating yes he mentioned

834
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:40,560
something about bringing this to the desktop so are we going to see snappy

835
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:45,840
and proper on the desktop or is this a totally different package manager or

836
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:51,080
what do you have that's great bringing over from the phone to the desktop how's

837
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:55,960
that gonna work with apt yeah so yeah it's not actually even it's more than a

838
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:00,640
package manager right oh yeah so on the on the desktop now if you want to

839
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:05,260
install some some application you go to the other Ubuntu software center or you

840
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:10,800
apt-get install something whereas on the phone we have a click store where there's

841
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:16,200
a siloed click application that you download from the store and install and

842
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:21,760
it's that that we will bring to the desktop there you go all right so we'll

843
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,260
cover more as we have info in the new segment on the Linux action show and you

844
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:29,320
can go play with it now there's like scripts out there to go get it if you

845
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:33,160
want to go play with a systemd powered version of Ubuntu you can have at it

846
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,760
it's an it's a new it's a new era of systemd and Ubuntu starting on the cloud

847
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:43,520
haters commence your hating yeah all right Matt well we have a pretty packed

848
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:47,040
show planned for Sunday I think we're gonna have multiple guests again it's

849
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,880
been really busy I know 24 the end of 2014 we got busy we doubled down it's

850
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,160
really it's thanks to our producers q5 system rotten corpse they've they've

851
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:57,160
really been hauling but Matt have a great week and I'll see you on Sunday

852
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:00,240
okay sounds good see you then all right everybody well thanks for tuning this

853
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,040
week's episode of Linux unplugged we do this show on Tuesdays we'd love to hear

854
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:07,480
your community review Fedora 21 next Tuesday join us over JB live TV don't

855
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:10,680
forget the big show on Sunday for more Fedora coverage all right everybody

856
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:35,080
thanks so much to in this week's episode see you back here next Tuesday

857
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:48,560
oh hi there so I'm playing a little video on the way out so great great show

858
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:53,040
thanks everybody mumble room you guys had a great showing and I wanted to

859
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:57,160
mention you know we talked about the Advent calendar last week and this week

860
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:02,920
there today the Advent calendar image of the day is the Ubuntu core for QMU so if

861
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:07,560
you want to go play with you yeah yeah so here's an interesting thought you

862
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:11,680
know we were talking about upstart versus system D like it seems like years

863
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:17,360
ago but it was not that long ago and I kept I kept saying to everyone you know

864
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:21,080
upstart has way more deployments than system D when you think about it it's

865
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:25,860
like millions of a bunch of users there's math that may mint users there's

866
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:29,680
Chrome OS users there's rail users they're all using upstart right there

867
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:34,080
cumulatively there's way more upstart users than there are system D now with

868
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:39,520
Ubuntu core given how popular Ubuntu is in the cloud it's possible that we could

869
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:46,120
flip that the other way around just with us doing that I'd have to go get my

870
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:50,400
measuring stick though Popey's and to tell but that would be a jolly big

871
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:57,680
measuring stick Wow well it is it is tis of course the new rails the new rail

872
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,840
seven use the system deal there's probably quite a few deployments of

873
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:08,600
that oh wow I was by the way just I was just playing a video I opened it up in

874
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:12,080
the other tab I just recorded a video for the tech talk today patrons if

875
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,920
you're a patron over there just posted a video it's it's me talking about

876
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,400
something very shameful that I have done and I come clean I even have my wife

877
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,520
there as moral support well I make my just one of those things where you stand

878
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:26,680
out in front of a podium and I don't know well it's pretty close to that it's

879
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:34,120
pretty close you're speaking from experience no I know I'm not gonna go

880
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:37,200
to details it's too much shame it's too much shame if you're a patron you can

881
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,840
watch it though don't forget about the best of to everybody alright so blaster

882
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:46,720
last week blaster I said you know I'm thinking about finally breaking down and

883
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:52,440
replacing the radio in my truck because I listened you know I drive about six

884
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:56,000
seven hours a week and I exclusively listen to podcasts during that entire

885
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:01,320
time and right now it's pretty ghetto I have a Bluetooth speaker box that I turn

886
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:05,840
on and I just put on my dashboard while I'm driving and I drive down the road

887
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:09,000
with my Bluetooth connected to that and like okay I'm kind of tired of being an

888
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:15,200
animal I think maybe I'm gonna go get like a and a dash replacement that has

889
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:19,160
Bluetooth and aux in and USB and I'm just gonna finally do it right and it's

890
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:23,160
about a hundred and thirty bucks for a decent one and blaster says to me and I

891
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,200
was like I don't really want to do it because every time I replace the

892
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,600
dashboard unit I'm I'm really unhappy I don't I usually think it doesn't match

893
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,040
the speakers and I feel like I need to replace the speakers and then I need to

894
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:34,320
get an amp and then I need to get a sub and I'm never happy with the way it

895
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:37,200
looks and it's always too bright and it kind of looks tacky compared to what the

896
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,160
what what what Dodge put in there originally so I was like I was telling

897
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,120
blaster I'm like I don't really want to do this but I'm just I'm an animal with

898
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:46,960
this Bluetooth speaker I feel like I'm in the 80s with my boombox and he says

899
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:51,280
well before you rip out your radio on your dashboard try getting an FM

900
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:56,960
transmitter and I said this truck kills all FM transmitters I don't know if it

901
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:02,360
has the world's weakest receiver but I have I have tried three or four solid

902
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:10,320
really well reviewed Bluetooth wired all you know remote antenna where it's up on

903
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:14,120
the dashboard all different kinds of FM transmitters in my truck they've never

904
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:18,000
worked right for me he says well before you go in and you make the big change

905
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,560
try get try getting the go groove flex smart x2 Bluetooth wireless in-car FM

906
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,480
transmitter and it's one of these deals where it's got it's okay it's got like a

907
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:30,480
bendable neck and it plugs into the cigarette adapter okay it's got a

908
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,000
separate power button on the cigarette adapter too so you can just turn off the

909
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,080
power it's got a digital display so you can you can dial in right exactly to the

910
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:40,640
FM station you want it's got call and hang up buttons because it does Bluetooth

911
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:45,000
hands-free dialing too it's got an extra USB port so you can still charge a

912
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,080
device over USB when you have it plugged in and it also has aux in and out audio

913
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:52,440
jacks so that way if you don't want to use Bluetooth you can have it go in over

914
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:56,360
a headphone jack and that's important yeah cuz good quality and he's like so

915
01:07:56,360 --> 01:08:00,600
just give this a shot and you know tell me what you think I'm like okay fine I

916
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,760
mean it's this is way better than you know paying for somebody to install it

917
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,480
and ripping out my dashboard it's an old truck it'll probably get screwed up and

918
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:11,920
I gotta tell you Matt I've been using it for a week and it has been flawless so

919
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,880
it it does an auto scan that's not too new and you know you just it just auto

920
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:20,200
scans and finds the best frequency and you can dial it up and down a little bit

921
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:23,280
if you want it connects over Bluetooth so the phone just stays right in my

922
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:27,160
pocket and it just connects up and it starts broadcasting immediately so I

923
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:31,440
don't have like you don't turn the truck on and then until it connects no it just

924
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,420
immediately is transmitting and then it connects over Bluetooth within a few

925
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:38,320
seconds and then it has play pause and skip the play pause like starts the

926
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:41,800
podcast right up and the skip does 30 second forward so I can jump ahead or

927
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:46,600
jump back if I need to and it's just perfect it was and it was like 35 40

928
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,920
bucks so I have the $10,000 question because that sounds really enticing to

929
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:57,040
me where I live if I want to listen to let's say I like let's let's say I'm

930
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,520
trying to tune into one thing there's a lot of mix-and-match stations between my

931
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:04,960
county and your county mm-hmm it goes from Canadian rock to Marriott Marriott

932
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,960
music pretty quickly so you know so that type of thing so does it like self adjust

933
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,820
the frequency as it goes well you can but then you'd have to change it on the

934
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:17,000
stereo so what blaster recommended I do and this is what I've done although I

935
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,840
actually haven't needed to go to backup is I went to a trouble spot area that I

936
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:25,000
thought I would have some issues by the airport here and I went through on I

937
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,720
turned off all my transmitters and I listened in the truck I just dialed

938
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:33,080
through the dial until I found an empty station in that area and now I know if I

939
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:36,280
need to I can have a preset on the on the preset buttons and I can just turn

940
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:41,000
the FM transmitter to that and switch over to that really quick oh cool okay

941
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,280
yeah oh that's awesome so blaster thank you for the recommendation

942
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:49,320
Chris if you guys on it yeah it's great have you got a cassette player in your

943
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:56,960
truck Chris I don't just the CD yeah yeah yeah cuz in my in my old car I used

944
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:02,360
a cassette adapter that had a Bluetooth receiver in it so you put the cassette

945
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:06,280
in the cassette player and it's a Bluetooth receiver and then you can

946
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:11,080
send your audio over Bluetooth and it plays through the cassette system was

947
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:15,520
that in your car wimpy was that your Ford Anglia yeah no it was it was my

948
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:25,280
Ford pop which one was it you had the go grew flex my x2 yeah go grew flex smart

949
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:29,480
x2 all right now I'll let you go good all right have a good rest of your week

950
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:34,280
Matt I'll see you Sunday bye JB towels come everybody go boat I do believe

951
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:42,560
there's an x3 model I chose the x2 I think for a reason I think I remember

952
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,880
reading some of the reviews on the x3 they say you can still get in time for

953
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:53,880
Christmas it's defragging necessary on a solid state technology actually yes yes

954
01:10:53,880 --> 01:11:01,480
very necessary depending on your solid-state disk spread out across the

955
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:04,920
LBA range in such a way that it's actually mapping to the same die on the

956
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:09,160
SSD and you lose all the parallelism effects of the SSD and your speed drops

957
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:16,120
to crap your bottleneck on the on the IO horribly okay I always thought that

958
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:19,920
defrag would cause wear on the device it does cause wear because you have to

959
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:26,520
rewrite the whole file somewhere else about that now really you could probably

960
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:30,560
write like a petabyte to most MLC SSDs and be fine so you're probably not

961
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:34,480
worried about where in most cases well on SSDs why would you defrag anyway

962
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:38,960
because if all of the blocks get mapped onto LBAs which are on one die then you

963
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,800
lose all the effects of the performance of the SSD because you have to

964
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:44,880
constantly be reading from one die one request at a time and that makes it

965
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:50,080
really slow the more channels you use the better yeah that makes sense

966
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:56,880
Samsung the Samsung SSDs that have a lot of they have a cache mechanism which is

967
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:02,200
sort of a species of RAM when you're defragging actually uses that cache

968
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:07,760
mechanism to avoid writing to and at that point when there's a version of it

969
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:12,680
which is a like about eight gigs or something of cache that is RAM it just

970
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:16,440
increases that so make the process a lot faster on the Samsung disks they have

971
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:21,360
eight gigs of TLC which is that that's actually used in SLC form so you're

972
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:26,240
actually using those three bit by two different process technology as a one

973
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:31,080
bit cell and so you're using all of them as one you're grouping a bunch of cells

974
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:34,920
together as one cell and so they call it fake SLC but you get the durability

975
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:39,760
approximately of SLC in this case and they write to that as a cache it's kind

976
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:43,640
of like an S log in ZFS if you're familiar with that concept they write a

977
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:47,600
journal to that eight gig space and then slowly copy it into the TLC LBA ranges

978
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:51,200
as time goes on and the nice thing is this persists even if you power off

979
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,800
because it's just you know more flash that they're writing to but you get

980
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,360
really good durability durability out of it and you can write in order and then

981
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,680
go ahead and throw stuff off and map them into different LBA ranges later so

982
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:05,680
it's not doing super huge writes right you can get really good performance so

983
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:10,480
if you're if you're if you're writing if you're writing a really large file does

984
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,960
it bypass that and go right to the slower stuff I would imagine it should

985
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:18,320
and that's probably okay for a really large file this is a lot of random

986
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:22,640
drives they pretty much negate that problem altogether it's flatline

987
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:27,400
performance all together at the one terabyte 850 evo drives nowadays no I

988
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:35,360
want that do this loud I have mostly evos
