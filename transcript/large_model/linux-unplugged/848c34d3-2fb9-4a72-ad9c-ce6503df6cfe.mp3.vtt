WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.100
All right, Wes Payne, I want you to take a guess.

00:02.200 --> 00:06.340
What is the average miles per hour in which you exhale air?

00:06.440 --> 00:09.040
So the speed at which it leaves your hot bod?

00:09.140 --> 00:11.180
Fourteen? Fourteen. What do you say, Cheese?

00:11.280 --> 00:13.680
Is it sneeze or is that just regular exhale?

00:13.980 --> 00:17.220
I think a sneeze is probably, like, pedal to the metal.

00:17.320 --> 00:18.320
So I say regular.

00:18.420 --> 00:19.420
That's a special case, yeah.

00:19.520 --> 00:23.160
Okay, so I'm gonna say 27 miles an hour.

00:23.260 --> 00:25.460
Whoa, okay. All right, what about you, Drew?

00:25.560 --> 00:26.660
I'm gonna go way lower.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.960
I'm gonna say, like, three miles per hour.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.360
He's a real slow breather, that's true.

00:30.460 --> 00:31.460
He's a smoker, maybe.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.560
Yeah. Anybody in the Mumble Room have a guess?

00:34.660 --> 00:35.660
Fifteen.

00:35.760 --> 00:36.940
Jill says 15.

00:37.040 --> 00:38.600
All right, are you ready for the big reveal?

00:38.700 --> 00:40.180
Are you ready? Are you ready?

00:40.280 --> 00:41.940
I've never wanted anything more.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.780
It is 15 miles per hour!

00:43.880 --> 00:44.880
Whoo!

00:44.880 --> 01:01.300
Hello, friends, and welcome into a very special edition of 357.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.300
My name is Chris.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.300
My name is Wes.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.940
I don't know how we got into this, Wes,

01:05.040 --> 01:07.700
but we are here on a Sunday with our virtual lug

01:07.800 --> 01:09.980
recording a special edition of the show

01:10.080 --> 01:11.680
while I am on the road.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.140
It's a bake-off, which we don't tend

01:14.140 --> 01:16.940
to get into, but on this episode,

01:17.040 --> 01:20.020
we each went off and took a lightweight Linux distribution

01:20.120 --> 01:23.720
with us, and we're gonna come back and, A,

01:23.820 --> 01:24.960
tell you what we thought about it,

01:25.060 --> 01:27.560
but, B, we created a point system,

01:27.660 --> 01:29.200
which I'll tell you about here in a moment,

01:29.300 --> 01:32.220
in which to score them, and we'll see who walks away

01:32.320 --> 01:34.960
with the ultimate lightweight distribution.

01:35.060 --> 01:37.640
So to help Wes and I do that, of course,

01:37.740 --> 01:39.000
is our two Robins.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.740
It's Drew and Cheese. Hello, gentlemen.

01:40.840 --> 01:41.740
Hello.

01:41.840 --> 01:42.740
Hello.

01:42.740 --> 01:46.740
I think that Drew, you went for the more retro Robin,

01:46.840 --> 01:50.120
and Cheese went for the more modern movie Robin.

01:50.220 --> 01:51.440
Skimpy, that's for sure.

01:51.540 --> 01:52.980
Yeah, Cheese, I'm not sure.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.360
I think that was a Robin costume for ladies.

01:55.460 --> 01:58.520
Hey, you don't be dissin' my cute-ass Robin costume.

01:58.620 --> 01:59.360
It looks good.

01:59.460 --> 02:00.320
It looks good, you know?

02:00.420 --> 02:01.720
I just gotta say, it looks good.

02:01.820 --> 02:03.460
And then, of course, all-wearing costume

02:03.560 --> 02:04.520
is our virtual lug.

02:04.620 --> 02:05.360
Hello, Mumble Room.

02:05.460 --> 02:06.660
Time-appropriate greetings.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.500
Hello.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.960
Happy Linux Tuesday recorded on a Sunday.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.940
Happy Sunday.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.280
Yeah, this is a special one.

02:14.380 --> 02:17.140
We just took over the virtual lug today with no heads up,

02:17.240 --> 02:19.180
because this is the last MINNA idea we had.

02:19.280 --> 02:20.140
Sorry, MINNY.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.340
Sorry, guys.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.940
But we wanted to get you in on this as well.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.120
We thought, why not?

02:24.220 --> 02:26.220
Let's have some fun talking about

02:26.320 --> 02:27.680
lightweight distributions.

02:27.780 --> 02:30.660
I think lightweight distributions hold a special part

02:30.760 --> 02:32.320
in all of our hearts.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.760
I think the first one that I really took seriously

02:34.860 --> 02:38.800
was probably back in the Lubuntu 1010 days, which back then

02:38.800 --> 02:43.940
included LXDE and was really nice for systems

02:44.040 --> 02:48.640
that were single-core processors before the domination

02:48.740 --> 02:51.540
of multi-core and tons and tons of RAM.

02:51.640 --> 02:56.340
I ran it on a system with 128 megabytes of RAM.

02:56.440 --> 02:59.380
And I think it was a Pentium 3.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.580
It was a really old system at the time.

03:01.680 --> 03:04.220
I mean, it just brings back some of that magic of, yeah,

03:04.320 --> 03:07.120
you can make Linux work on that when whatever proprietary OS

03:07.120 --> 03:09.020
came on it is no longer supported.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.360
There's that.

03:10.460 --> 03:13.460
It's like bringing life into a system, which feels incredible.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.000
But it's also a special challenge

03:15.100 --> 03:17.560
that not every distribution decides to take on,

03:17.660 --> 03:20.240
because it's not necessarily an easy goal to fit

03:20.340 --> 03:22.140
within these tiny constraints.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.280
Mind those dependencies.

03:24.380 --> 03:27.240
Especially when you want yourself a modern desktop.

03:27.340 --> 03:31.320
So we set off to define a few rules around the game

03:31.420 --> 03:32.580
and award some points.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.480
Now, because this is a special edition, gentlemen,

03:34.480 --> 03:38.580
the floor is open for you to ask any questions about the rules

03:38.680 --> 03:41.620
or make any suggestions, because we're doing this as we go.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.400
But we had some minimum requirements that will

03:43.500 --> 03:45.500
earn your distribution a point.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.860
So you need to be responsible for tracking your points here.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.540
Do you guys have something?

03:49.640 --> 03:50.840
I got paper right here.

03:50.940 --> 03:53.400
What, are you asking us to tally our own points?

03:53.500 --> 03:55.700
Because I'm going to give myself a winning number, so.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.340
Bring your own tally.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.040
The audience will be keeping count,

03:59.140 --> 04:02.140
and they will hold you accountable.

04:02.140 --> 04:05.380
So you'll get one point if you can run it on a single CPU

04:05.480 --> 04:08.380
core, if you can run it with one gig of RAM,

04:08.480 --> 04:09.880
you get a point for each of these, I think.

04:09.980 --> 04:10.720
What do you think?

04:10.820 --> 04:12.020
You like doing it that way?

04:12.120 --> 04:14.120
Or do you think you should just get one point for all of them?

04:14.220 --> 04:15.560
No, I like splitting them up.

04:15.660 --> 04:17.400
All right, so these are one pointers.

04:17.500 --> 04:21.400
One CPU, one gigabyte of RAM, within a gigabyte

04:21.500 --> 04:26.500
of hard drive space, easy dark mode, and easy to install.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.900
And you must be able to run a web browser that

04:29.900 --> 04:33.840
can play any episode of LUP in the browser.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.240
So that is for one point.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.220
If you get one point for each of those.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.340
All right.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.920
Now, the bonus round, where each one of these

04:41.020 --> 04:44.580
is awarded five points, if you can get a modern GTK

04:44.680 --> 04:47.720
or cute theme on there, and I define that in here as ARK,

04:47.820 --> 04:52.620
YARU, POP, or Breeze, if you can install software that is not

04:52.720 --> 04:55.600
in the distribution's repos, so somehow get software

04:55.700 --> 04:58.360
from outside the repos running on the box,

04:58.360 --> 05:00.640
that is also worth five points.

05:00.740 --> 05:03.740
Another five points if you can play YouTube or Netflix

05:03.840 --> 05:05.340
in your browser.

05:05.440 --> 05:07.980
And if you can boot to the desktop within 20 seconds,

05:08.080 --> 05:09.440
another five points.

05:09.540 --> 05:13.620
And if any video game at all plays, five points.

05:13.720 --> 05:14.620
All right.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.320
Not a lot of points, but some of these

05:16.420 --> 05:17.520
are slightly challenging.

05:17.620 --> 05:19.860
Some of these distros, it may be harder to get ARK or YARU

05:19.960 --> 05:20.660
or POP on there.

05:20.760 --> 05:21.660
Sure.

05:21.760 --> 05:23.820
The modern GTK theme, is that out of the box?

05:23.920 --> 05:26.420
Or is that something that you can install after?

05:26.420 --> 05:28.360
I think it's fair if you can get it after.

05:28.460 --> 05:29.160
I think that's fair.

05:29.260 --> 05:30.160
Do you guys agree with that?

05:30.260 --> 05:30.660
Agreed.

05:30.760 --> 05:31.160
Agreed.

05:31.260 --> 05:31.760
Yeah.

05:31.860 --> 05:32.960
OK, all right.

05:33.060 --> 05:34.160
Because I mean, honestly, at this level,

05:34.260 --> 05:35.800
you're the type of user that's OK doing that.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.540
All right, then we have the illumination round,

05:37.640 --> 05:39.800
which is 10 points for each one of these.

05:39.900 --> 05:43.380
You get 10 points if you can get it to run Visual Studio code.

05:43.480 --> 05:45.240
Just thought that'd be a fun one.

05:45.340 --> 05:47.320
And 10 points if you can get it to install

05:47.420 --> 05:49.920
a different kernel than the one that it shipped with,

05:50.020 --> 05:52.520
and it still boots.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.380
So 10 points for that.

05:54.380 --> 05:56.820
And then we have the will of the people round.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.860
An additional 10 points will be awarded just for one thing.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.560
If you convince a co-host, each co-host

06:02.660 --> 06:04.800
you convince that your distro is the best,

06:04.900 --> 06:06.540
you can be awarded 10 points.

06:06.640 --> 06:07.860
Yeah, OK.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.100
Y'all turncoats.

06:09.200 --> 06:10.440
I mean, this is, I think, a chance

06:10.540 --> 06:12.000
where if your distribution can't meet

06:12.100 --> 06:13.880
some of these other minimums, you

06:13.980 --> 06:15.980
could make it up in the will of the people round.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.740
It's the personality factor.

06:18.840 --> 06:21.180
So we hit the randomize button, and we're

06:21.280 --> 06:23.780
each distributed a distribution, which

06:23.780 --> 06:26.980
I now am, of course, a main advocate for.

06:27.080 --> 06:31.660
Drew was distributed Bunsen Labs, Cheese, Puppy Linux,

06:31.760 --> 06:35.600
Wes, FreeBSD, and what was the other one, Wes?

06:35.700 --> 06:37.860
Well, this was a late contender I added to the race

06:37.960 --> 06:39.160
because it was just too fun.

06:39.260 --> 06:41.700
OK, so FreeBSD is going to be my main contender.

06:41.800 --> 06:45.540
But Calibri OS is written in pure assembly

06:45.640 --> 06:47.940
and needs only something like eight megs of RAM.

06:48.040 --> 06:50.080
So I thought, why not go super tiny?

06:50.180 --> 06:51.540
Now, it's not going to score very well,

06:51.640 --> 06:53.440
but I thought it deserved an amendment.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.140
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to hearing about that,

06:56.240 --> 06:57.480
and FreeBSD.

06:57.580 --> 07:00.880
And then I was assigned Sparky Linux,

07:00.980 --> 07:03.060
which I'm looking forward to telling you about because

07:03.160 --> 07:06.860
obviously, it is the best Linux out of all of these

07:06.960 --> 07:08.500
and should clearly be the winner.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.460
And by the end of this, you'll all want to run it.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.360
So we'll talk about that.

07:12.460 --> 07:13.900
These are the ground rules.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.600
It's a little complicated, but it's essentially

07:16.700 --> 07:20.380
there is a one-point category, a five-point category,

07:20.480 --> 07:22.580
and a 10-point category.

07:22.580 --> 07:24.580
And then there is that final will of the people category

07:24.680 --> 07:26.640
that's also 10 points, just one item.

07:26.740 --> 07:28.880
And that is convince a co-host.

07:28.980 --> 07:31.180
So what do you say we start with Bunsen Labs?

07:31.280 --> 07:33.220
Drew, I'm curious to know about Bunsen Labs

07:33.320 --> 07:35.620
and why we should all be using it.

07:35.720 --> 07:39.960
First of all, it is so Debian that you can switch to it

07:40.060 --> 07:41.520
from a base Debian system.

07:41.620 --> 07:42.520
Oh, wow.

07:42.620 --> 07:43.520
OK.

07:43.620 --> 07:46.360
Bunsen Labs Helium, you can get as a PPA

07:46.460 --> 07:49.640
and convert your current Debian system into Bunsen Labs.

07:49.640 --> 07:52.540
So what does that mean?

07:52.640 --> 07:55.980
First of all, you have the full power of Debian behind you.

07:56.080 --> 07:59.140
So this is going to score very, very, very highly

07:59.240 --> 08:00.080
on this test.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.280
Talk's a big game.

08:01.380 --> 08:02.480
Oh, I do.

08:02.580 --> 08:03.520
And rightly so.

08:03.620 --> 08:05.980
I ran it on one core and one gig of RAM.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.880
No problem whatsoever.

08:07.980 --> 08:10.180
Yeah, but this thing's based on Debian 9.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.360
Snore.

08:11.460 --> 08:12.800
Wah, wah, wah.

08:12.900 --> 08:14.100
Oh, well.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.220
If I'm deploying systems all over left and right,

08:16.320 --> 08:18.260
I want something modern.

08:18.260 --> 08:19.700
I want like Debian 10.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.340
Yeah, but I can still get back ports through PPAs.

08:22.440 --> 08:23.940
OK, all right.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.300
I was not really able to get it to install

08:26.400 --> 08:28.280
with one gigabyte of disk.

08:28.380 --> 08:30.840
Just to get it to properly install and be

08:30.940 --> 08:34.380
able to run updates afterwards, I had to go to five gigabytes.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.340
But I would recommend going to 10 gig

08:36.440 --> 08:37.820
for a fully functional system.

08:37.920 --> 08:39.620
So losing a point there, but.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.880
OK, did anybody else get in within the one gig?

08:43.980 --> 08:45.260
Did anybody get the one gig point?

08:45.360 --> 08:46.160
Not quite.

08:46.160 --> 08:49.120
Not with the GUI, although Calibri OS totally does.

08:49.220 --> 08:52.060
Yeah, I got to admit, I did not quite get there either.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.060
I got really close.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.340
And none of us got the one gig point.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.140
But Drew, did you get the one CPU core?

08:56.240 --> 08:57.240
Oh, absolutely.

08:57.340 --> 08:58.800
All right, so mark yourself a point down for that.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.640
What about how much RAM?

09:00.740 --> 09:01.640
One gig.

09:01.740 --> 09:03.600
All right, so you get a point for that.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.580
How was the install to disk?

09:05.680 --> 09:08.920
Install to disk was fine as soon as I had a big enough disk.

09:09.020 --> 09:10.980
Right, OK, tell us about that.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.980
Super easy.

09:12.980 --> 09:16.660
So it has an install to disk option in the grub menu.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.960
And it launches into a nice, easy installer.

09:19.060 --> 09:21.800
It explains everything as you're going,

09:21.900 --> 09:24.360
and tells you exactly what it's doing,

09:24.460 --> 09:26.600
and asks you simple questions that you

09:26.700 --> 09:28.900
can decide on how to proceed.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.140
It is fine with just the default options.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.500
I didn't change a single thing, and had

09:34.600 --> 09:37.580
zero problems going through the entire installation.

09:37.680 --> 09:42.480
OK, I got to admit, early on, I'm feeling a little concerned.

09:42.480 --> 09:45.020
Are you feeling competitive right now, Cheese?

09:45.120 --> 09:46.380
Nah.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.260
Yeah, OK, all right, OK.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.160
Damn it, Debian.

09:50.260 --> 09:52.220
So what about easy dark mode?

09:52.320 --> 09:55.460
No, there was no dark mode out of the box.

09:55.560 --> 09:58.160
I'm not going to give myself a point for that.

09:58.260 --> 10:00.200
I could get a dark mode going to the repos

10:00.300 --> 10:02.060
and downloading something, but I feel

10:02.160 --> 10:04.440
like the easy dark mode should be out of the box.

10:04.540 --> 10:05.740
So I'm going to say no.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.500
OK, I think we all agree on that.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.800
I am curious, is there any special sauce

10:09.800 --> 10:12.440
you really liked about it to keep things light?

10:12.540 --> 10:14.540
I mean, if you've got the full power of Debian,

10:14.640 --> 10:16.320
are they doing anything different about how

10:16.420 --> 10:19.180
they set up defaults, or just tune things to keep it small?

10:19.280 --> 10:22.860
Aside from just using Openbox as the window manager,

10:22.960 --> 10:26.760
I don't know what special things they're doing on the back end

10:26.860 --> 10:28.600
to make it run so light.

10:28.700 --> 10:31.700
But the default install is literally

10:31.800 --> 10:34.440
it's just Openbox on a Debian-based system

10:34.440 --> 10:39.800
with kernel 4.9 and it has Firefox ESR instead

10:39.900 --> 10:41.700
of the latest stable.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.440
Aside from that, it doesn't appear

10:43.540 --> 10:46.540
that there's any specific kernel tuning or anything

10:46.640 --> 10:51.680
like that that is really making it so light.

10:51.780 --> 10:53.980
I think it's just the fact that Debian

10:54.080 --> 10:55.860
doesn't need much to begin with.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.060
And neither does Openbox.

10:57.160 --> 10:58.520
Really, it doesn't, yeah.

10:58.620 --> 11:01.200
So did you get a rough idea of what you're just sort

11:01.300 --> 11:03.860
of sitting idle RAM usage was?

11:03.860 --> 11:05.300
Very, very low.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.060
I didn't specifically calculate it,

11:07.160 --> 11:09.260
but it wasn't even really showing up

11:09.360 --> 11:12.400
in my virtual machine manager.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.280
I know.

11:13.380 --> 11:14.480
That's what's so funny about this, huh?

11:14.580 --> 11:15.580
These things are so lightweight,

11:15.680 --> 11:17.080
you don't even really notice them.

11:17.180 --> 11:18.940
All right, well, let's get into the bonus round here.

11:19.040 --> 11:20.780
So did it have a modern theme?

11:20.880 --> 11:23.520
Not out of the box, but it's Debian.

11:23.620 --> 11:24.920
So any theme you could, OK.

11:25.020 --> 11:26.480
I think you get five points for that then.

11:26.580 --> 11:27.480
I do.

11:27.580 --> 11:28.760
Were you able to install any software that

11:28.860 --> 11:30.120
wasn't in the repos?

11:30.220 --> 11:32.720
I installed software from PPAs, and I also

11:32.720 --> 11:34.020
compiled from source.

11:34.120 --> 11:34.820
Oh, snap.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.060
All right, total five points.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.860
Were you able to play YouTube or Netflix?

11:38.960 --> 11:43.940
I was able to play YouTube on the live CD version,

11:44.040 --> 11:47.540
and I was able to get into Netflix after installing

11:47.640 --> 11:50.540
the DRM in Firefox.

11:50.640 --> 11:54.080
But unfortunately, it crashed while I

11:54.180 --> 11:55.380
was trying to play Netflix.

11:55.480 --> 11:59.080
However, after I installed it to disk, no problems whatsoever.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.660
Netflix worked without even skipping a beat.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.220
Now, I'm betting, because it is Debian-based,

12:05.320 --> 12:08.560
you probably didn't get to the desktop in under 20 seconds.

12:08.660 --> 12:12.160
Actually, on the very first boot,

12:12.260 --> 12:16.160
I got to the desktop in 26.8 seconds.

12:16.260 --> 12:20.240
However, after that, on any subsequent boot,

12:20.340 --> 12:21.640
seven seconds on the dot.

12:21.740 --> 12:22.640
Whoa.

12:22.740 --> 12:23.840
Really?

12:23.940 --> 12:24.940
All right, I think you get five points for that.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.140
Any video games?

12:26.140 --> 12:29.120
Yeah, I loaded up a few simple games,

12:29.220 --> 12:31.220
because I was running in a virtual machine,

12:31.320 --> 12:34.920
and I didn't have any kind of real DRM

12:35.020 --> 12:37.220
or any kind of access to the video card.

12:37.320 --> 12:39.800
I wasn't going to try anything like super snazzy,

12:39.900 --> 12:43.760
but I was playing Xtron, I'll Riot, Xboard.

12:43.860 --> 12:45.840
Stuff's in Debian, so.

12:45.940 --> 12:47.940
So you got every category.

12:48.040 --> 12:51.340
You got every one of those in the five points category.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.080
All right, now to the elimination round.

12:53.180 --> 12:54.380
Each one of these is 10 points.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.280
Does it run Visual Studio Code?

12:56.380 --> 12:57.280
I'm assuming, yes.

12:57.380 --> 13:00.180
Yes, I did have to pull Flatpak

13:00.280 --> 13:02.620
from the squeeze back ports PPA.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.460
But as soon as I did that, no problems whatsoever,

13:05.560 --> 13:06.460
came right up.

13:06.560 --> 13:07.660
What about installing a different kernel?

13:07.760 --> 13:08.660
Did you go for that one?

13:08.760 --> 13:10.120
I installed the Licorix kernel.

13:10.220 --> 13:11.020
Oh, true.

13:11.120 --> 13:11.820
Whoa.

13:11.920 --> 13:12.860
Oh, no, guys.

13:12.960 --> 13:16.400
Kernel 5.6, and that booted in 8.67.

13:16.500 --> 13:17.840
OK, wow, OK.

13:17.940 --> 13:20.140
So I think we'll hold the convince till the end,

13:20.240 --> 13:24.080
which will be the extra, but you're doing really well there.

13:24.080 --> 13:27.480
Bunsen Lab sounds like a serious contender.

13:27.580 --> 13:29.120
What was the final disk size?

13:29.220 --> 13:30.220
That's what I'm curious about.

13:30.320 --> 13:31.420
Yeah, good question.

13:31.520 --> 13:35.520
I went with 10 gig because Flatpak is a little heavier

13:35.620 --> 13:37.560
as far as disk space.

13:37.660 --> 13:39.160
And that was the only way I was able to really get

13:39.260 --> 13:40.220
VS Code going.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.620
OK, all right, fair enough.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.160
All right, well, standby, Drew, I'll have a few more questions,

13:44.260 --> 13:46.860
but we got to go to cheese now on Puppy

13:46.960 --> 13:49.400
and see how Puppy stacks up and how many points.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.800
Drew, do you have a rough back of the napkin calculation

13:51.900 --> 13:53.540
so far of how many points you got there?

13:53.540 --> 13:56.540
Oh, let's take a look here, 1, 2.

13:56.640 --> 14:09.520
So let's see, I got 5 for that, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 45, so 47.

14:09.620 --> 14:10.720
Ouch.

14:10.820 --> 14:11.820
OK, so cheesy.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.560
Let's see if we can beat 47.

14:14.660 --> 14:16.800
How was Puppy Linux?

14:16.900 --> 14:18.560
Puppy Linux is great.

14:18.660 --> 14:19.560
It's real great.

14:19.660 --> 14:20.400
Convince me now.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.300
You're not really convincing me.

14:22.300 --> 14:23.840
Yeah, I'm definitely not going to win

14:23.940 --> 14:27.240
that portion of the 10 points.

14:27.340 --> 14:30.200
So I did run it on a single core with a single gig of RAM,

14:30.300 --> 14:31.940
as you would expect.

14:32.040 --> 14:36.480
Normally, Puppy's meant to just boot and load into RAM.

14:36.580 --> 14:40.060
I'm using boxes here for this, so I

14:40.160 --> 14:42.160
ran into an issue with boxes where I could only

14:42.260 --> 14:44.760
go down to 10 gigs in size.

14:44.860 --> 14:48.720
Final install size, though, was 1.4 gigabyte.

14:48.820 --> 14:50.620
I definitely hit all of those marks.

14:50.720 --> 14:51.700
That's impressive.

14:51.700 --> 14:57.400
I guess, except for the hard drive, it was 1.4 gigabyte.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.640
I was able to run a browser, their Pale Moon browser,

15:00.740 --> 15:02.900
and play an episode of Love.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.740
There is an easy dark mode, kind of.

15:07.840 --> 15:08.440
How do you figure?

15:08.540 --> 15:08.980
What do you mean?

15:09.080 --> 15:10.580
Yeah, let's get into that.

15:10.680 --> 15:14.320
It's JWM, and there are different themes for JWM,

15:14.420 --> 15:16.180
GTK2-based themes.

15:16.180 --> 15:21.620
So I was able to install, out of the box, Nox, the Nox theme, which

15:21.720 --> 15:24.400
is their version of a dark theme.

15:24.500 --> 15:28.000
While maybe not extremely pretty, it is a dark mode.

15:28.100 --> 15:31.740
So I was able to get a dark mode out of the box.

15:31.840 --> 15:35.340
Easy to install the disk is kind of, I mean, it is.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.940
It's stupid simple to install to disk, but.

15:38.040 --> 15:41.880
You sound a little, I don't know, not confident.

15:41.980 --> 15:44.020
Well, the way the Puppy is kind of set up, right,

15:44.020 --> 15:46.240
is that it's the root user.

15:46.340 --> 15:48.420
Like, everything defaults as root.

15:48.520 --> 15:52.420
Now, you can go through settings to kind of adjust that to,

15:52.520 --> 15:57.420
I think there's three different levels, FIDO being basically

15:57.520 --> 15:59.600
a guest user type of thing.

15:59.700 --> 16:02.060
So it's really a different kind of Linux.

16:02.160 --> 16:06.400
It's not really your typical install.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.800
The prompts are ridiculous.

16:08.900 --> 16:11.200
You're not convincing me at all.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.580
You know, I'm putting it all out there on the table, right?

16:13.580 --> 16:17.180
It's one of those things where there's just a ton of these

16:17.280 --> 16:22.680
prompts that are just lengthy and don't make a ton of sense.

16:22.780 --> 16:26.380
There are three different networking applications

16:26.480 --> 16:27.620
to choose from by default.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.500
How do you want to connect to your network sort of thing?

16:30.600 --> 16:32.900
Like, if this one doesn't work, try this one.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.800
If that one doesn't work, try this one.

16:34.900 --> 16:38.060
If you need a NDIS wrapper or something, try this one.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.340
So it's kind of silly, right?

16:40.440 --> 16:42.640
But you see, this is where you have an advantage.

16:42.640 --> 16:46.780
Because for this, we're scoring it by the rules of the game.

16:46.880 --> 16:50.840
So if you got this thing to play YouTube or any video game at all,

16:50.940 --> 16:52.940
you're getting five points for either one of those things.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.220
I think maybe at the end, we should consider too, like,

16:55.320 --> 16:58.460
which one has the least space, since it sounds like we're all

16:58.560 --> 16:59.760
kind of going over a little bit.

16:59.860 --> 17:01.560
And I would mention too, BiteBitten points out

17:01.660 --> 17:03.620
in the Mumble Room that this is available for some other

17:03.720 --> 17:06.100
platforms where the minimal size really matters.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.260
Right, like the Pi.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.460
If you wanted to run it on the Pi, it'd be great for that.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.660
I don't like running stuff as root,

17:11.660 --> 17:13.940
so it's kind of weird for me, but yeah.

17:14.040 --> 17:17.080
So what about things like VS Code or getting a different kernel

17:17.180 --> 17:18.280
on there, how did that go?

17:18.380 --> 17:20.740
So I kind of combined this two in one.

17:20.840 --> 17:23.920
I installed software, which wasn't in the repos.

17:24.020 --> 17:28.620
I installed VS Code or VS Codeium via an app image.

17:28.720 --> 17:34.020
All right, OK, OK, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.500
We got to have a quorum on this.

17:36.600 --> 17:40.660
See, I was thinking specifically it needs to be VS Code, not VS Codeium,

17:40.660 --> 17:42.860
because VS Codeium is easier.

17:42.960 --> 17:45.140
And I was thinking VS Code makes it actually a little harder

17:45.240 --> 17:47.900
because it's the quote unquote, you know, official version,

17:48.000 --> 17:49.540
which is slightly hard to get your hands on.

17:49.640 --> 17:52.640
But I'm open to what Drew and Wes think on this issue.

17:52.740 --> 17:53.740
Half credit.

17:53.840 --> 17:54.880
All right, I'll agree with that.

17:54.980 --> 17:56.580
Cheese, are you OK with that compromise?

17:56.680 --> 17:57.480
Yes.

17:57.580 --> 17:58.780
All right, all right.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.780
Because there is that element of like, you have to use proprietary X,

18:01.880 --> 18:02.580
can't you?

18:02.680 --> 18:04.280
Yes, that's what that was going for there.

18:04.380 --> 18:05.420
OK, OK.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.660
Because obviously in this situation,

18:06.760 --> 18:07.860
you would just use VS Codeium.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.020
I agree, that's the right way to go.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.320
But OK, we'll do five points.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.120
Continue on.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.020
I'm sorry, I just wanted to clarify that.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.000
I was able to install that app image.

18:15.100 --> 18:20.340
It doesn't have a modern GTK theme, so no five there.

18:20.440 --> 18:24.240
I was able to play YouTube, so a five point there.

18:24.340 --> 18:25.240
OK, good.

18:25.340 --> 18:28.540
It booted in 12 seconds consistently.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.640
Oh.

18:29.740 --> 18:31.280
So not bad.

18:31.380 --> 18:35.380
As far as any video game, they have a section in Puppy called Fun.

18:35.480 --> 18:38.380
And I was able to play a Sudoku clone.

18:38.480 --> 18:39.520
Did you have fun?

18:39.520 --> 18:40.320
Yes.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.120
Good.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.320
I am glad you had fun.

18:42.420 --> 18:44.920
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

18:45.020 --> 18:47.260
Have you tallied up your score yet?

18:47.360 --> 18:49.060
Not quite.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.140
I was not able to install a different kernel

18:51.240 --> 18:55.640
by the default install, to be honest.

18:55.740 --> 18:57.540
I just didn't go down that route.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.740
You can easily switch kernels if you're

18:59.840 --> 19:01.980
booting it off of a flash drive or something like that.

19:02.080 --> 19:05.420
You're not actually installing it to disk.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.980
So yeah, not really on that.

19:07.980 --> 19:12.720
But if I tallied it up, that would be, what is it?

19:12.820 --> 19:22.200
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.000
So I'm looking at 30 points.

19:24.100 --> 19:25.400
All right, 30 points.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.800
All right, 30 points for cheese.

19:26.900 --> 19:27.800
I'm going to write that down.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.040
That's not bad cheese, especially

19:29.140 --> 19:31.880
because Puppy Linux is a longtime contender.

19:31.980 --> 19:34.280
All right, Mr. Payne, we move on to you.

19:34.380 --> 19:37.240
And let's start with your free BSD.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.880
What do you say, let's try to score free BSD

19:39.980 --> 19:41.280
against the board, and then you just

19:41.380 --> 19:43.880
tell us a little bit about your side fling there.

19:43.980 --> 19:45.220
Yeah, all right.

19:45.320 --> 19:47.620
Because I really, that's kind of what I'm most interested in.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.420
But I am interested also in how free BSD is stacked up.

19:50.520 --> 19:51.460
What was the experience?

19:51.560 --> 19:52.600
You know, honestly, nice.

19:52.700 --> 19:54.800
I always enjoy free BSD, but it had been a little bit

19:54.900 --> 19:57.400
since I really tried to shape it into something.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.460
And I thought, how lean is it?

19:59.560 --> 20:02.240
I mean, I've always found it to be just well organized,

20:02.340 --> 20:03.980
not necessarily aimed towards being lean.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.400
But why not give it a shot?

20:06.400 --> 20:09.580
It has some good, I mean, some very good base requirements,

20:09.680 --> 20:12.180
minimum hardware requirements, 96 megs of RAM.

20:12.280 --> 20:15.620
So that was a no brainer at passing a whole gig of RAM.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.520
Yeah, there's a point.

20:17.620 --> 20:21.220
I think when I just installed base, it was under a gig.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.260
But with like everything necessary, it was about 2.5.

20:24.360 --> 20:27.060
That was to get XFCE on the desktop.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.400
Fair enough.

20:28.500 --> 20:30.600
I think we all went over the one gig disk limit.

20:30.700 --> 20:33.060
When we were sitting around dreaming up these requirements,

20:33.060 --> 20:36.800
I think maybe we were being a little over nostalgic.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.200
It's interesting to see.

20:39.300 --> 20:41.180
And I mean, Colibri definitely gets there.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.740
But you're right, at some point, the applications

20:43.840 --> 20:46.480
that we want to use these days, regardless of even just the OS

20:46.580 --> 20:48.580
part of it, there's a lot of dependencies

20:48.680 --> 20:50.420
because we have a lot of expectations

20:50.520 --> 20:51.760
about richly featured software.

20:51.860 --> 20:53.380
You know, it's just funny because I don't know,

20:53.480 --> 20:56.660
does anybody remember making like special DOS

20:56.760 --> 20:59.600
or even Mac boot disk to play video games

20:59.700 --> 21:01.960
where you'd have just a minimal OS and the game

21:01.960 --> 21:03.160
all on one disk?

21:03.260 --> 21:04.060
Oh, absolutely.

21:04.160 --> 21:04.860
Yep.

21:04.960 --> 21:05.700
What a time.

21:05.800 --> 21:06.900
A simpler time.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.840
FreeBSD Handbook is, of course, excellent.

21:08.940 --> 21:10.600
So, you know, walked me basically through like,

21:10.700 --> 21:12.140
all right, how do I get X up and going?

21:12.240 --> 21:13.680
How do I install XFCE?

21:13.780 --> 21:15.580
And then from there, I had it on Firefox.

21:15.680 --> 21:18.340
So listening back to an episode of Linux Unplugged,

21:18.440 --> 21:19.840
that was also pretty easy to do.

21:19.940 --> 21:22.680
You really took the build it up from the ground approach.

21:22.780 --> 21:24.380
And that means things like dark mode and whatnot

21:24.480 --> 21:27.320
are themes that you just install from the package manager

21:27.420 --> 21:28.620
or whatever.

21:28.620 --> 21:32.660
And so in a way, it's sort of easy to get these points

21:32.760 --> 21:34.520
because you built the system towards it.

21:34.620 --> 21:37.460
However, I don't, and I'm totally open to Drew

21:37.560 --> 21:39.460
and Cheez's interpretation to this.

21:39.560 --> 21:42.200
I think it still qualifies because our listeners

21:42.300 --> 21:43.940
could do that if they were so interested.

21:44.040 --> 21:47.300
And it was all very, you know, I mean, the installer

21:47.400 --> 21:48.880
was very helpful to get me started with what did I

21:48.980 --> 21:50.040
want to get set up with.

21:50.140 --> 21:51.840
And then the Handbook gave you lots of options.

21:51.940 --> 21:53.280
It didn't say you had to, but you know,

21:53.380 --> 21:54.540
just like if you want to go down the route

21:54.640 --> 21:56.480
to a graphical interface, here you go.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.720
So the initial install, it's all still in Curses?

21:58.820 --> 22:00.020
Yeah. Wow.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.280
But it's very efficient. You know, it was a pleasant experience.

22:02.380 --> 22:03.780
Yeah. No, it is. All right.

22:03.880 --> 22:07.460
So I think you're probably going to qualify for the one points

22:07.560 --> 22:09.520
except for the one gigabyte hard drive.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.660
But I don't think any of us are getting that.

22:11.760 --> 22:13.500
So you might take that off your list if you have it.

22:13.600 --> 22:17.440
But would you classify that as a pretty easy to install OS

22:17.540 --> 22:19.800
if you were just generally fairly comfortable

22:19.900 --> 22:21.340
using computers and whatnot?

22:21.440 --> 22:23.040
Yeah, I think so. You know what it also had

22:23.140 --> 22:25.340
that most operating systems don't.

22:25.340 --> 22:28.240
Just an easy automatic ZFS installer option.

22:28.340 --> 22:29.240
Oh, really?

22:29.340 --> 22:31.980
So I went with UFS for this little test,

22:32.080 --> 22:34.180
but I mean, it works really nicely.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.860
Okay. I was going to say, I think our buddy Allen Jude

22:35.960 --> 22:36.860
had a hand in that.

22:36.960 --> 22:37.860
Right.

22:37.960 --> 22:39.960
Okay. So let's get to the five point bonus round,

22:40.060 --> 22:43.260
which is modern GTK theme, installing something

22:43.360 --> 22:44.660
that's not in the repos,

22:44.760 --> 22:46.260
which I'm really interested in that one.

22:46.360 --> 22:48.240
And then obviously playing YouTube or Netflix,

22:48.340 --> 22:49.800
booting to the desktop in 20 seconds

22:49.900 --> 22:52.600
or any video game at all.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.380
Did you have challenges with any of those?

22:54.380 --> 22:56.880
Okay, so GTK theme, that was fine.

22:56.980 --> 22:58.680
The Arc theme is in the ports tree,

22:58.780 --> 23:01.840
so that was easy to get, which the ports tree is awesome.

23:01.940 --> 23:03.620
Maybe second only to the AUR.

23:03.720 --> 23:07.580
You know, honestly, configuring FreeBSD up

23:07.680 --> 23:08.820
and getting it all running,

23:08.920 --> 23:12.620
it does, Arch and FreeBSD seem like they are sort of

23:12.720 --> 23:14.620
two sides of the same coin in some respects.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.620
Obviously, there's a ton of philosophical differences

23:16.720 --> 23:19.800
between them, but just from my end user experience of them,

23:19.900 --> 23:20.800
and I like both of them.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.100
I absolutely have felt that way too.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.840
I am interested that you have had that same observation.

23:24.940 --> 23:28.440
I think what happened is FreeBSD users just said,

23:28.540 --> 23:29.840
you know what, I'm gonna go do this on Linux.

23:29.940 --> 23:31.440
Right, exactly.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.740
I really liked what I had, but I want this random piece

23:33.840 --> 23:35.520
of hardware that Linux has support for to work,

23:35.620 --> 23:38.680
so I guess I'll use their bastard kernel.

23:38.780 --> 23:40.780
Okay, so what went less well?

23:40.880 --> 23:43.760
I did get YouTube to work in Firefox, no Netflix.

23:43.860 --> 23:44.920
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's okay.

23:45.020 --> 23:46.520
If you get one of them, you still get the point.

23:46.620 --> 23:47.900
Oh, okay, really?

23:48.000 --> 23:51.360
Yeah, I'm not gonna let DRM hold us back.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.400
I like it.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.140
I feel like, you know, and Firefox is doing

23:55.240 --> 23:57.140
a lot of the heavy lifting there, I suppose.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.900
Feel free to push back, but I mean,

24:00.000 --> 24:01.940
I think to make that work, we should have made Netflix

24:02.040 --> 24:03.240
its own point item.

24:03.340 --> 24:04.780
That's right, there's a slash in there.

24:04.880 --> 24:07.620
Yeah, all right, how about that desktop boot time?

24:07.720 --> 24:10.120
Just under the wire at 18 seconds.

24:10.220 --> 24:12.580
Ha, spoiler alert, that's what mine was too.

24:12.680 --> 24:15.020
Okay, what about any video game at all?

24:15.120 --> 24:16.820
Super Tux Cart was in the ports tree,

24:16.920 --> 24:18.120
so I gave that an install.

24:18.220 --> 24:19.720
Classic.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.720
Okay, now we get to the ten points.

24:21.820 --> 24:24.060
Can you get VS Code going on FreeBSD?

24:24.160 --> 24:26.660
VS Codium, yes, that is, I believe that's what's

24:26.760 --> 24:28.960
in the ports tree, that's what I gave it an install,

24:29.060 --> 24:30.300
that seemed to work.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.600
I didn't edit anything really in it,

24:31.700 --> 24:33.340
but it's the open source version.

24:33.440 --> 24:35.140
So five points, I think, to you for that.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.240
So adjust your accounting.

24:37.340 --> 24:39.380
Oh, I did install some software, not in the repos,

24:39.480 --> 24:41.480
because I didn't even check, I don't know why,

24:41.580 --> 24:44.880
but I just downloaded RIPGrip, that handy,

24:44.980 --> 24:48.580
super fast, Rust-implemented grip alternative

24:48.580 --> 24:51.980
and so it gave the Rust stuff an install on FreeBSD

24:52.080 --> 24:53.080
so I could compile it.

24:53.180 --> 24:55.520
Huh, okay, that counts.

24:55.620 --> 24:59.200
Does the kernel, so we have, this is a tough one.

24:59.300 --> 25:00.400
I was gonna, yeah.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.100
For ten points, we have install a different kernel,

25:02.200 --> 25:04.400
but you kinda could choose your own kernel in a way, right?

25:04.500 --> 25:06.400
I mean, I'm not super familiar with the way FreeBSD works,

25:06.500 --> 25:09.400
but I assume you had some governance.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.480
Well, and I mean, should I at least get half points

25:11.580 --> 25:13.940
just because I'm using a non-Linux kernel for this one?

25:14.040 --> 25:15.540
Yeah, I think maybe you could get five.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.480
You guys okay with that, what do you think?

25:17.480 --> 25:18.580
Yeah, sure.

25:18.680 --> 25:19.980
Giving him points now, come on.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.380
Well, no, I mean, we don't have to, but it seems like.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.820
He's bringing BSD to a Linux challenge.

25:24.920 --> 25:29.320
I mean, we could not.

25:29.420 --> 25:32.300
I think Cheese is just butt-hurt because he scored so low.

25:32.400 --> 25:35.260
Hey, don't you be hatin' on the woof-woof.

25:35.360 --> 25:38.200
Hey, you brought the jalopy, bro, I'm sorry.

25:38.300 --> 25:42.780
Okay, so, Wes, you're looking pretty good there.

25:42.880 --> 25:47.340
Do you have a grand total for FreeBSD on our Linux podcast?

25:47.340 --> 25:49.080
Oh, no, what have we done?

25:49.180 --> 25:50.080
Forty.

25:50.180 --> 25:51.280
Well, he beat Puppy.

25:51.380 --> 25:55.420
That wasn't surprising that that was gonna happen.

25:55.520 --> 25:58.820
So far, though, we got Drew in the lead at 47.

25:58.920 --> 26:01.360
Yeah, well, we'll see.

26:01.460 --> 26:02.960
I'm hoping to convince you all.

26:03.060 --> 26:04.400
I didn't even bother doing the kernel

26:04.500 --> 26:08.200
because I think I'm gonna win the Convince Your Co-Host round here

26:08.300 --> 26:12.940
because Sparky Linux was something special that I came across.

26:13.040 --> 26:16.040
I wasn't expecting to fall in love,

26:16.040 --> 26:17.440
but I definitely have.

26:17.540 --> 26:21.180
It's a Linux distribution that's on top of Debian.

26:21.280 --> 26:25.040
And boy, do I now appreciate what that means.

26:25.140 --> 26:27.980
When you're looking for a minimal Linux distro,

26:28.080 --> 26:32.920
having a Debian base means you have access to everything.

26:33.020 --> 26:36.720
And Sparky is a fast, lightweight, fully customizable OS

26:36.820 --> 26:38.300
that has a couple of different versions

26:38.400 --> 26:40.400
that I'll get into here in a moment.

26:40.500 --> 26:42.100
But something else that I think,

26:42.200 --> 26:44.740
as somebody who has used a distribution on and off

26:44.740 --> 26:47.200
a couple of times, as a guy who has used Linux

26:47.300 --> 26:50.140
every now and then for a couple of years,

26:50.240 --> 26:53.740
one of the things I have learned is a active community

26:53.840 --> 26:55.740
makes the difference between a living distribution

26:55.840 --> 26:57.220
and a dead one.

26:57.320 --> 27:00.680
Sparky Linux has a very healthy Linux community around it

27:00.780 --> 27:04.860
and also very active developers who are laying out

27:04.960 --> 27:07.520
near-term and long-term roadmaps.

27:07.620 --> 27:09.260
This month, I mean, it's not a huge goal,

27:09.360 --> 27:13.160
but this month, they are 210% funded by their community.

27:13.160 --> 27:14.960
That's great. Wow.

27:15.060 --> 27:16.440
This is something special here.

27:16.540 --> 27:18.700
Sparky Linux is something really special.

27:18.800 --> 27:23.000
And I think it's targeted at those of us

27:23.100 --> 27:25.480
who have been around for a little while,

27:25.580 --> 27:29.080
tried a couple of desktops, and we know what we like.

27:29.180 --> 27:32.680
The main features of Sparky, obviously, is that it's Debian.

27:32.780 --> 27:36.380
But it has two branches, stable and semi-rolling,

27:36.480 --> 27:37.860
which is awesome.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.860
And of course, I obviously went with semi-rolling.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.460
Lightweight, fast, simple.

27:43.560 --> 27:45.460
It has lots of desktops to choose from,

27:45.560 --> 27:47.860
and it has a command line edition that has no X,

27:47.960 --> 27:49.860
where you can just build up from the ground up.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.260
Oh, fancy that.

27:51.360 --> 27:54.940
Mm-hmm. This is the FreeBSD guy.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.180
And I really like their three special editions

27:57.280 --> 27:58.880
that they focus on.

27:58.980 --> 28:02.880
So they have a Game Over edition, which is great.

28:02.980 --> 28:04.680
I'll talk more about that in a minute.

28:04.780 --> 28:08.120
They have a multimedia edition for audio and video.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.920
They have a rescue edition for going in

28:11.020 --> 28:12.320
and fixing broken Linux systems.

28:12.420 --> 28:13.720
Oh, I called right out. That's handy.

28:13.820 --> 28:15.820
Yeah. And a minimal command line edition,

28:15.920 --> 28:17.420
which is really nice.

28:17.520 --> 28:22.260
But I chose to go with the rolling LX cute version

28:22.360 --> 28:24.060
of their distribution.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.900
They also offer XFCE and MATE.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.740
But I went LX cute.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.440
And they also have a, I should add,

28:30.540 --> 28:33.140
a minimal GUI version, which is Openbox.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.140
Oh, nice.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.480
Which I also checked out,

28:35.580 --> 28:37.620
because I was really enjoying this distribution.

28:37.620 --> 28:39.680
So I just kind of, I ate it all up.

28:39.780 --> 28:41.320
I just tried out all the different spins

28:41.420 --> 28:43.320
because it was so great.

28:43.420 --> 28:47.520
But for my main testing, I focused on the LX cute version.

28:47.620 --> 28:49.060
Now let's go down the points, because I got an issue

28:49.160 --> 28:51.820
with the starting line, and I got to ask you guys about this.

28:51.920 --> 28:54.660
So it technically fits within a system

28:54.760 --> 28:55.900
within one gigabyte of RAM.

28:56.000 --> 28:56.740
Okay.

28:56.840 --> 28:58.800
With a major caveat.

28:58.900 --> 29:00.440
How much swap are we talking?

29:00.540 --> 29:04.280
Actually, by default, it does not have the swap enabled.

29:04.380 --> 29:06.240
And when you only have one gig of RAM on a system

29:06.240 --> 29:07.780
with no swap, let me tell you

29:07.880 --> 29:09.780
about the careful dance you learned to take.

29:09.880 --> 29:12.480
Yeah, I mean, I turned swap off on the systems I installed.

29:12.580 --> 29:16.020
Yeah, I did not have swap, and it was something.

29:16.120 --> 29:19.220
Firefox was really great until it wasn't, let me tell you.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.960
I think you just got it treated as a single tab browser.

29:22.060 --> 29:23.720
Yes, very much.

29:23.820 --> 29:26.660
So the installer, I think it's a bug,

29:26.760 --> 29:29.000
and that's why I think maybe we should allow this.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.800
So it technically runs on systems

29:30.900 --> 29:34.500
with one gigabyte of free RAM.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.500
But when you boot a live environment...

29:36.600 --> 29:37.840
Well, that takes some RAM.

29:37.940 --> 29:40.140
And then you technically do not have a gigabyte of free RAM.

29:40.240 --> 29:43.420
The installer does a check, is one gigabyte free, yes or no?

29:43.520 --> 29:45.620
And when it's no, it puts up an error message

29:45.720 --> 29:47.120
and does not allow you to continue.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.120
However, if you go with the minimal GUI

29:49.220 --> 29:52.120
or the minimal CLI version, and you do it on the same box,

29:52.220 --> 29:53.960
and it doesn't do that check, or it does the check

29:54.060 --> 29:56.920
and you're using so little RAM, it's okay, it continues.

29:57.020 --> 29:59.000
And then you can use the system just fine.

29:59.100 --> 30:01.360
Right, so if you, right, you can even boost the RAM,

30:01.460 --> 30:02.740
install, and then shrink it down.

30:02.740 --> 30:04.840
And it would work fine, I did exactly that test

30:04.940 --> 30:06.440
for the gaming edition.

30:06.540 --> 30:08.440
Yeah, I think you should get that point then.

30:08.540 --> 30:12.340
So what did it idle around on RAM usage?

30:12.440 --> 30:14.440
So good question, I did take a note of that.

30:14.540 --> 30:17.040
Let me pull up my notes here, cheese.

30:17.140 --> 30:18.940
You know, honestly, that just feels like experiences

30:19.040 --> 30:21.780
I've had installing operating systems on Mac hardware

30:21.880 --> 30:23.580
after they said, no, they won't support this.

30:23.680 --> 30:24.860
But if you edit that P list...

30:24.960 --> 30:26.260
Yes, yeah.

30:26.360 --> 30:28.760
I don't know, I kind of take issue with this.

30:28.860 --> 30:29.900
Okay.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.500
If there's a bug in the installer

30:31.500 --> 30:35.760
that causes you not to be able to install on one gig of RAM,

30:35.860 --> 30:37.100
that is problematic.

30:37.200 --> 30:41.780
However, there is a case to be said for the fact

30:41.880 --> 30:44.540
that you were able to do it on another edition.

30:44.640 --> 30:47.080
So I don't know, I could go either way.

30:47.180 --> 30:48.740
That does seem like a savior right there.

30:48.840 --> 30:50.880
Yeah, it's sort of a tricky one

30:50.980 --> 30:52.580
because you could just do the CLI

30:52.680 --> 30:55.980
and then apt-get install the desktop and you'd be fine.

30:56.080 --> 30:57.620
Sounds like a half point to me.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.360
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, half point.

30:59.360 --> 31:01.460
But then I'm in like a 0.5 situation

31:01.560 --> 31:02.860
because this is only a one pointer.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.860
Yeah, half point, round up to one, give it to you.

31:05.960 --> 31:06.960
All right, all right, okay.

31:07.060 --> 31:08.460
So half a point, I'll take half a point

31:08.560 --> 31:09.460
if you guys are okay with that.

31:09.560 --> 31:12.100
I think that's fair because there is that issue.

31:12.200 --> 31:15.700
So you'd have to, yeah, all right, I think it's fair.

31:15.800 --> 31:18.140
So yeah, so cheese, you asked what was the base run rate?

31:18.240 --> 31:21.740
Just with the LXQt version, which I checked the most,

31:21.840 --> 31:24.720
with it just running and everything kind of like sitting

31:24.720 --> 31:29.320
there for 10 minutes, I was using 398 megabytes of RAM.

31:29.420 --> 31:30.320
Okay.

31:30.420 --> 31:31.620
Not bad.

31:31.720 --> 31:33.220
So I mean, you're still within that threshold of one gig,

31:33.320 --> 31:34.060
right?

31:34.160 --> 31:35.260
Here's what surprised me.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.620
I mean, this is kind of horrible,

31:36.720 --> 31:38.620
but also is not the end of the world.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.960
I, spoiler alert, was able to install third party apps

31:42.060 --> 31:43.100
because it's Debian-based.

31:43.200 --> 31:47.800
Chrome, watching the SpaceX live stream,

31:47.900 --> 31:51.340
750 megabytes of RAM usage, not horrible.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.240
I mean, really close to my limit, right?

31:53.240 --> 31:57.420
So I was able to launch a terminal and do htop.

31:57.520 --> 32:00.680
So that was in that mix, but I don't have much room

32:00.780 --> 32:03.060
for anything else, like another Chrome tab.

32:03.160 --> 32:04.560
What was interesting about this is

32:04.660 --> 32:09.100
Firefox ran really, really well in this one core

32:09.200 --> 32:11.700
limited memory environment until it didn't.

32:11.800 --> 32:15.260
And then it just drug my whole system down,

32:15.360 --> 32:19.440
where Chrome was just consistently slow.

32:19.540 --> 32:20.340
Interesting.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.000
Yeah, I just thought that was one thing.

32:22.000 --> 32:25.340
But just an aside here, guys, as somebody

32:25.440 --> 32:28.340
who has been around and using the Linux desktop

32:28.440 --> 32:31.540
since single core computers were a common thing,

32:31.640 --> 32:36.420
holy crap is single core Linux painfully slow.

32:36.520 --> 32:39.220
I did not fully appreciate or understand

32:39.320 --> 32:42.360
how much my Linux desktop has taken advantage

32:42.460 --> 32:44.700
of multi-core progress because it just

32:44.800 --> 32:45.920
was like the boiling frog thing.

32:46.020 --> 32:49.560
It just sort of happened slowly as the technology built out.

32:49.660 --> 32:51.000
So did the desktop, and the developers

32:51.000 --> 32:52.060
took advantage of it.

32:52.160 --> 32:57.080
I know it sounds silly to say this, but back in my day,

32:57.180 --> 33:00.080
there was a real push to try to convince developers

33:00.180 --> 33:03.440
that multi-core development was worth their time.

33:03.540 --> 33:06.220
I even attended an Intel event where

33:06.320 --> 33:09.220
they tried to make a pitch to open source developers

33:09.320 --> 33:12.020
that it was worth their effort to support multi-core

33:12.120 --> 33:13.180
processors.

33:13.280 --> 33:16.020
And they said that the days of CPU megahertz increasing

33:16.120 --> 33:17.920
year after year were over.

33:18.020 --> 33:18.820
This is an Intel event.

33:18.820 --> 33:22.800
They fed us, they brought us in, they put up this video,

33:22.900 --> 33:25.260
the whole thing about Moore's law and all that,

33:25.360 --> 33:28.600
and they showed like a progression of the Pentium line

33:28.700 --> 33:31.900
from the 286 to the 386 to the 486 to the Pentium

33:32.000 --> 33:34.880
to the Pentium 2 to the Pentium 3 to the Pentium 4

33:34.980 --> 33:38.340
and just this increase, increase, increase of megahertz

33:38.440 --> 33:39.420
that was so impressive.

33:39.520 --> 33:42.520
And you have to understand that for a period of time,

33:42.620 --> 33:45.780
it was just assumed that this was just the law of computing,

33:45.880 --> 33:47.480
that this megahertz increase was just

33:47.480 --> 33:52.560
going to continue at infinitum until we were piling starships.

33:52.660 --> 33:56.500
And Intel sat us all down and said, no, no, no, no.

33:56.600 --> 33:57.700
We're kind of done with that.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.840
The megahertz race is over.

33:59.940 --> 34:02.200
We're going to have some gradual increments,

34:02.300 --> 34:04.700
but what it's all about now is cores.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.680
We're going to have multiple cores.

34:06.780 --> 34:10.080
This is before they did like the core series and all of that.

34:10.180 --> 34:11.740
There was a line of Intel processors

34:11.840 --> 34:13.480
that I actually have in the machine here that

34:13.580 --> 34:16.880
was before the core series, but still multi-core.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.280
And it was right around this time.

34:19.380 --> 34:22.520
And they were trying to make the case to developers

34:22.620 --> 34:25.520
to go with multi-processing and multi-core development.

34:25.620 --> 34:26.320
Yeah, right.

34:26.420 --> 34:27.320
I mean, it is extra work.

34:27.420 --> 34:28.560
You've got to sell them.

34:28.660 --> 34:30.100
If you want to take advantage of the hardware that's

34:30.200 --> 34:32.000
going to be out there in your customer's hands,

34:32.100 --> 34:33.140
this is what you have to do.

34:33.240 --> 34:35.800
Yeah, and so now from an end user's perspective,

34:35.900 --> 34:39.340
I just didn't really appreciate how well the Linux desktop had

34:39.440 --> 34:41.780
adapted to the multi-core CPU world

34:41.880 --> 34:44.440
because it just sort of happened organically over time.

34:44.440 --> 34:47.780
But by doing this challenge and going back in time

34:47.880 --> 34:50.120
and limiting myself to one gigabyte of RAM

34:50.220 --> 34:54.680
and one CPU core, even if it was like a 2.3 gigahertz CPU

34:54.780 --> 34:57.260
core or whatever, is painfully slow.

34:57.360 --> 35:00.220
It's striking how better it is now.

35:00.320 --> 35:01.420
We really have it good.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.120
Well, and I wonder how much of that

35:03.220 --> 35:07.760
is due to you using LXQt because I did not have the same

35:07.860 --> 35:09.900
experience under Openbox.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Everything was snappy and fast for me,

35:12.000 --> 35:15.240
even with one core and one gig of RAM.

35:15.340 --> 35:17.540
I wouldn't say that the desktop was necessarily slow.

35:17.640 --> 35:20.080
It was just if I was installing software

35:20.180 --> 35:23.580
and I was trying to watch the SpaceX video stream,

35:23.680 --> 35:25.380
I definitely was waiting on stuff.

35:25.480 --> 35:26.720
Like, I would click on a new tab,

35:26.820 --> 35:28.220
and it would be a few beats before.

35:28.320 --> 35:31.220
I mean, I was definitely I felt like I was pushing it.

35:31.320 --> 35:35.100
There's also a question of what your backing store was.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.300
I was running on an NVMe.

35:37.400 --> 35:41.260
It's a WD Blue NVMe M.2 drive.

35:41.260 --> 35:45.600
And that could play a big part of it too.

35:45.700 --> 35:47.340
Also, I did have swap.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.840
So yeah, I don't know.

35:50.940 --> 35:53.040
Cheater.

35:53.140 --> 35:56.780
I honestly, I felt like the one thing

35:56.880 --> 35:58.320
that Sparky Linux was missing for me

35:58.420 --> 36:00.520
after all the spins that they have

36:00.620 --> 36:03.780
was this would be so perfect on the Raspberry Pi.

36:03.880 --> 36:06.620
It would have been like the ideal desktop environment.

36:06.720 --> 36:08.260
Because everything else in this list I had,

36:08.260 --> 36:11.120
I had easy access to dark mode.

36:11.220 --> 36:13.760
They just have it right there built in.

36:13.860 --> 36:16.300
That was absolutely no problem.

36:16.400 --> 36:19.560
VS Code, Chrome, fine.

36:19.660 --> 36:20.200
That all worked.

36:20.300 --> 36:21.240
Easy installation.

36:21.340 --> 36:23.140
Yeah, the installer, the GUI installer,

36:23.240 --> 36:25.000
it felt like maybe I'd done it 1,000 times.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.740
It's obviously some installer I've used before.

36:26.840 --> 36:28.280
I just don't know what it's called.

36:28.380 --> 36:29.840
All that worked fine.

36:29.940 --> 36:33.240
I played Extreme Tax Cart Racer flawlessly.

36:33.340 --> 36:34.320
It worked just great.

36:34.420 --> 36:37.320
And if you use their game mode, which

36:37.320 --> 36:39.980
is really cool, it comes loaded with games,

36:40.080 --> 36:42.220
but it also has Steam installed.

36:42.320 --> 36:43.820
It has Steam installed?

36:43.920 --> 36:47.860
Yeah, or it's that, you know, I actually didn't run it.

36:47.960 --> 36:49.000
I just saw it on the menu.

36:49.100 --> 36:51.860
So it's possible it is that script that just downloads

36:51.960 --> 36:52.900
Steam and runs it.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.240
But it's right there in the menu, already set to go.

36:56.340 --> 36:58.180
They call it the Game Over Edition.

36:58.280 --> 37:00.580
And it loads XFCE.

37:00.680 --> 37:01.840
And it's great.

37:01.940 --> 37:04.120
It is really fun.

37:04.120 --> 37:09.120
And the gaming on it is just basically one click

37:09.220 --> 37:11.080
to get things started.

37:11.180 --> 37:13.420
I was really impressed with Sparky.

37:13.520 --> 37:16.660
Their Openbox edition, also really well done.

37:16.760 --> 37:19.400
But I think, ultimately, what I really liked about it

37:19.500 --> 37:21.600
was the way the developers were communicating

37:21.700 --> 37:24.000
with the community.

37:24.100 --> 37:26.300
They have forum posts, which are, I mean,

37:26.400 --> 37:27.500
they're even active today.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.040
I checked it before the show, and there's

37:29.140 --> 37:30.400
topics that are going today.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.040
But they have forum posts about their next milestones

37:33.040 --> 37:35.480
for the distribution and where they see it going.

37:35.580 --> 37:37.120
They're very transparent about the development.

37:37.220 --> 37:38.120
That's really neat.

37:38.220 --> 37:39.440
They're basing it on Debian, which

37:39.540 --> 37:42.960
means you have access to any deb file, so Chrome or VS code.

37:43.060 --> 37:44.860
We're just a deb download away.

37:44.960 --> 37:47.760
A bunch of really smart defaults, so things

37:47.860 --> 37:49.820
that I like to use out of the box, like gdebi,

37:49.920 --> 37:52.120
were already installed and ready to go.

37:52.220 --> 37:54.260
It was simple to install Chrome.

37:54.360 --> 37:57.260
The base installation is tiny.

37:57.360 --> 38:01.840
It's not one gig, but it's just around just a little bit

38:01.840 --> 38:03.040
over two gigs.

38:03.140 --> 38:05.540
Yeah, OK.

38:05.640 --> 38:08.740
And I like that it's a modern Debian, too.

38:08.840 --> 38:11.640
Their, quote unquote, rolling is essentially Debian testing

38:11.740 --> 38:13.280
or whatever.

38:13.380 --> 38:15.320
Or SID, is that what it's called in Debian?

38:15.420 --> 38:17.460
And because I'm old, I don't remember anymore.

38:17.560 --> 38:19.060
It's called Bullseye.

38:19.160 --> 38:22.160
And I think it's totally usable as a desktop.

38:22.260 --> 38:23.560
Everything was simple.

38:23.660 --> 38:24.760
Everything worked.

38:24.860 --> 38:27.160
And the community had a lot of interesting discussions

38:27.260 --> 38:29.160
going on about future directions.

38:29.260 --> 38:31.000
And I felt like, at the end of it,

38:31.000 --> 38:32.200
this is a distribution.

38:32.300 --> 38:34.000
And I don't often say this.

38:34.100 --> 38:36.400
This is something I'm going to keep using.

38:36.500 --> 38:40.040
This is now my go-to clean Debian environment in a VM.

38:40.140 --> 38:41.840
That does sound very minimal and just.

38:41.940 --> 38:43.280
And because they're semi-rolling,

38:43.380 --> 38:46.880
it's an apt update, apt get update, whatever.

38:46.980 --> 38:48.320
Follow along with Debian.

38:48.420 --> 38:49.780
And I'm essentially current.

38:49.880 --> 38:51.320
And because it's so minimal, there's

38:51.420 --> 38:52.680
not a lot that's going to break.

38:52.780 --> 38:55.660
So I can leave this in a VM, park it for months at a time,

38:55.760 --> 39:00.500
fire it back up, do an update upgrade, and I'm good to go.

39:00.500 --> 39:01.900
Really, the only thing I didn't do

39:02.000 --> 39:03.560
was bother installing a different kernel

39:03.660 --> 39:05.860
because everything was working really great.

39:05.960 --> 39:08.600
I think, really, when you look at it,

39:08.700 --> 39:12.300
Sparky Linux is that thing we didn't really

39:12.400 --> 39:15.580
know was possible anymore, is a new community based

39:15.680 --> 39:19.420
around a Debian distro cropping up that really actually kind

39:19.520 --> 39:23.980
of fills a few niches and isn't just barking into the wind.

39:24.080 --> 39:26.020
A community has actually shown up

39:26.120 --> 39:29.760
and is funding this thing at the tune that is,

39:29.760 --> 39:35.300
I'm very happy to say, 210% of the monthly goal, right?

39:35.400 --> 39:37.460
Like, there's a real response here.

39:37.560 --> 39:40.640
Barking into the wind, was that a stab at puppy?

39:40.740 --> 39:43.200
Also, what kind of boot time did you get?

39:43.300 --> 39:44.600
18 seconds.

39:44.700 --> 39:47.640
I got 18 seconds on that there boot time, which just barely

39:47.740 --> 39:48.840
under it.

39:48.940 --> 39:50.080
And I felt like maybe could have been a little better.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.440
I tell you, there's that.

39:51.540 --> 39:52.820
I felt like the boot time could have been slightly faster,

39:52.920 --> 39:54.180
although I'll take it.

39:54.280 --> 39:56.520
I would have loved to have seen the Arc theme installed

39:56.620 --> 39:59.420
by default, obviously, in the repo.

39:59.420 --> 40:01.020
Why not have it by default?

40:01.120 --> 40:04.920
And boy, howdy, would I love an ARM version.

40:05.020 --> 40:07.960
This would be such a solid candidate for a Pi 4 desktop.

40:08.060 --> 40:10.040
Well, you know, Chris, I just looked,

40:10.140 --> 40:14.200
and there actually is on, if you go to sparkylinux.org

40:14.300 --> 40:17.340
slash tag slash Raspberry Pi, they actually

40:17.440 --> 40:20.640
do have builds ready to go.

40:20.640 --> 40:29.720
I think Chris should be minus points for not finding that.

40:29.820 --> 40:32.180
I mean, I don't want to speak here for all of you,

40:32.280 --> 40:33.860
but clearly this is a contender now

40:33.960 --> 40:37.060
because the active community, the Debian rolling base,

40:37.160 --> 40:40.800
or stable, whichever you prefer, the several editions

40:40.900 --> 40:45.660
that scratch different itches, and an ARM edition.

40:45.760 --> 40:48.400
How are you going to beat this in a lightweight distro, guys?

40:48.500 --> 40:49.640
How are you going to beat that?

40:49.640 --> 40:52.040
So I mean, that's why I'm going for that additional 10 points

40:52.140 --> 40:53.480
of convincing your co-hosts.

40:53.580 --> 40:55.380
I didn't even bother with the kernel

40:55.480 --> 40:58.640
because I think if you just look at the facts here,

40:58.740 --> 41:01.720
you add it all up, I have 39.5 points base.

41:01.820 --> 41:05.880
But if you add that 10 point convince a co-host,

41:05.980 --> 41:08.920
if any one of you agree with me that this is a solid

41:09.020 --> 41:11.360
lightweight distro with a great community available

41:11.460 --> 41:14.200
for multiple platforms and different types of uses,

41:14.300 --> 41:16.460
then I get 10 additional points.

41:16.460 --> 41:20.960
And that puts me at 49.5, which is ahead of Drew at 47.

41:21.060 --> 41:22.340
I'm just putting that out there.

41:22.440 --> 41:25.080
I think that your whole display there

41:25.180 --> 41:28.080
was the convincing the co-host.

41:28.180 --> 41:31.140
I think you started with convincing your co-hosts,

41:31.240 --> 41:34.120
and then you went into the specs.

41:34.220 --> 41:37.480
And let's not forget that Chris added the convincing

41:37.580 --> 41:44.460
the co-host 10 point round today, today, hours ago.

41:44.560 --> 41:45.800
Moments before the show.

41:45.800 --> 41:46.900
Yes, that's true.

41:47.000 --> 41:48.500
However, he looked at it.

41:48.600 --> 41:52.000
He saw what I was posting in Slack and said,

41:52.100 --> 41:54.140
oh my god, I'm going to lose this thing.

41:54.240 --> 41:55.140
I need something.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.940
Yep.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.700
No, I just feel like, I just thought, you know what?

41:59.800 --> 42:01.080
At the end of the day, you got to have

42:01.180 --> 42:03.380
an inclusive understanding of a distribution.

42:03.480 --> 42:04.780
It can't just be a by the numbers thing.

42:04.880 --> 42:06.580
It's got to be about the community too.

42:06.680 --> 42:08.340
And we needed a way to factor that.

42:08.440 --> 42:10.880
And I thought if one of us could truly advocate because we

42:10.980 --> 42:12.980
love something, we fell in love with it,

42:13.080 --> 42:14.360
that should be worth something.

42:14.360 --> 42:16.260
Well, let me just tell you, Calibri OS,

42:16.360 --> 42:17.460
I added up the points for it.

42:17.560 --> 42:18.260
Oh, shoot.

42:18.360 --> 42:19.300
And it got 19.

42:19.400 --> 42:20.800
Hold on, hold on, I forgot all about that.

42:20.900 --> 42:22.500
If three of us vote that it's our favorite.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.440
I got so obsessed with Winnie, and I completely

42:24.540 --> 42:25.440
forgot to talk about that.

42:25.540 --> 42:27.100
So give us your thoughts on Calibri OS.

42:27.200 --> 42:29.740
Well, it's a small open source x86 only,

42:29.840 --> 42:30.740
so I'm losing out there.

42:30.840 --> 42:33.140
But hey, FreeBSD runs on all kinds of stuff.

42:33.240 --> 42:35.540
It's forked off a Menuet OS, if you remember that.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.580
And it's just coded completely in assembly.

42:37.680 --> 42:40.020
And all right, if you thought what you were using

42:40.120 --> 42:42.320
was a throwback, this thing is amazing.

42:42.320 --> 42:44.520
Not only does it have primo floppy support,

42:44.620 --> 42:49.520
it's got read-only NTFS, it can do ext2, 3, and 4.

42:49.620 --> 42:51.760
But it comes with a whole bunch of games,

42:51.860 --> 42:53.760
including Doom, let me just say.

42:53.860 --> 42:57.560
And a ton of just handy from all this compile chain,

42:57.660 --> 43:00.900
a lot of nice tools for doing development in assembly.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.140
And then an IRC client that you can use to connect up to,

43:04.240 --> 43:05.980
some other chat stuff, its own web browser.

43:06.080 --> 43:09.140
Now, I wasn't able to play the MP3.

43:09.240 --> 43:11.980
It does include an audio player, and sound does work.

43:11.980 --> 43:14.820
But the web browser didn't want to.

43:14.920 --> 43:17.880
I tried to download it, but our MP3s are hosted on HTTPS,

43:17.980 --> 43:20.320
and I think that's what things went wrong.

43:20.420 --> 43:21.420
Are you serious?

43:21.520 --> 43:22.660
I didn't verify.

43:22.760 --> 43:25.700
It did load the page, so like linuxunplugged.com loaded,

43:25.800 --> 43:27.600
and it got to the download link,

43:27.700 --> 43:29.100
but I tried to use the built-in.

43:29.200 --> 43:30.660
Yeah, HTTPS is hard.

43:30.760 --> 43:33.000
I think if I had done it and pulled up a terminal,

43:33.100 --> 43:34.800
downloaded it that way, and I could have played it back

43:34.900 --> 43:35.800
on the operating system.

43:35.900 --> 43:37.240
Using like WGIT or something, curl or something.

43:37.340 --> 43:40.180
It does have a bunch of Unix built-ins,

43:40.180 --> 43:42.340
and it comes with a compiler tool chain,

43:42.440 --> 43:45.880
so you can install stuff from an outside operating system,

43:45.980 --> 43:49.920
and it boots wicked fast, so it should get extra points there.

43:50.020 --> 43:52.520
I love this, because this is one of those OSs

43:52.620 --> 43:54.020
that you didn't even know existed,

43:54.120 --> 43:55.920
and now you just want to go check it out.

43:56.020 --> 43:57.420
I just searched for this online,

43:57.520 --> 43:59.420
and one of the things that came up was,

43:59.520 --> 44:00.760
my mom tries it out.

44:00.860 --> 44:03.360
But Wikipedia says, Wes,

44:03.460 --> 44:05.060
that they haven't had a release for a year.

44:05.160 --> 44:07.200
For a year, but hey, we were talking about XFCE,

44:07.300 --> 44:08.700
so we all know that that's okay sometimes.

44:08.700 --> 44:10.340
Fair enough, fair enough, fair enough.

44:10.440 --> 44:13.700
You only need an i586 compatible CPU, so.

44:13.800 --> 44:15.940
All right, so I think what we have here

44:16.040 --> 44:17.540
is a bit of a standstill, and we need to bring in

44:17.640 --> 44:20.320
our virtual lug to help us sort this out a little bit.

44:20.420 --> 44:22.880
I know some of you have been listening along

44:22.980 --> 44:24.780
and have your own considerations.

44:24.880 --> 44:27.260
Jill, you've heard the arrangement.

44:27.360 --> 44:28.560
I know that you've been around.

44:28.660 --> 44:29.820
You've seen these distros.

44:29.920 --> 44:31.660
What do you think is the winner here?

44:31.760 --> 44:34.320
Who should get the Convince the Co-host 10 points?

44:34.420 --> 44:37.060
Definitely Sparky Linux. I love it too.

44:37.060 --> 44:39.060
And it's just so flexible.

44:39.160 --> 44:40.960
Hey, really?

44:41.060 --> 44:43.600
That was not planned. That was not planned.

44:43.700 --> 44:46.300
Okay, Jill, please go into detail.

44:46.400 --> 44:47.700
Checks in the mail, Jill.

44:47.800 --> 44:50.680
It's a beautiful-looking desktop and minimal,

44:50.780 --> 44:53.280
and you can run Steam games on it.

44:53.380 --> 44:57.180
So for me, that was, that's huge.

44:57.280 --> 44:59.820
And this is a really, really great challenge.

44:59.920 --> 45:02.960
There's another distro that's kind of similar to Sparky

45:03.060 --> 45:05.560
called AntiX, or Antics.

45:05.560 --> 45:07.100
Oh, yeah.

45:07.200 --> 45:11.460
Yeah, and so that one was based on originally MeePis

45:11.560 --> 45:14.060
with my group, the Linux Checks of Los Angeles.

45:14.160 --> 45:18.040
We used that to install on old Pentium II

45:18.140 --> 45:21.380
and Pentium III laptops that went to third world countries.

45:21.480 --> 45:22.780
Oh, that's great.

45:22.880 --> 45:24.680
And it's still running great on those machines,

45:24.780 --> 45:26.680
and they're still actively updating it.

45:26.780 --> 45:29.880
And it's a wonderful little Debian distro

45:29.980 --> 45:32.020
that does all the things.

45:32.120 --> 45:33.920
That is a bit of what we're talking about here.

45:33.920 --> 45:36.720
And we get so caught up in vulnerabilities

45:36.820 --> 45:38.960
about Intel CPUs and old machines

45:39.060 --> 45:40.460
that are just discarded now.

45:40.560 --> 45:43.260
But the reality is you can put a distribution

45:43.360 --> 45:45.860
on these things, and if it's the right one,

45:45.960 --> 45:47.940
that machine could run until the components fail,

45:48.040 --> 45:50.500
which is a surprisingly long time.

45:50.600 --> 45:53.080
At this rate, it seems to be long after the world ends.

45:53.180 --> 45:54.740
Yeah, definitely.

45:54.840 --> 45:56.780
And another suggestion I had,

45:56.880 --> 45:59.720
and it's one of my favorite distros of all time,

45:59.820 --> 46:02.880
is Tiny Core Linux, which was a spinoff

46:02.880 --> 46:05.680
of damn small Linux.

46:05.780 --> 46:09.660
And it actually runs on my thin clients,

46:09.760 --> 46:13.660
my four megabytes of RAM thin clients.

46:13.760 --> 46:14.860
Wow.

46:14.960 --> 46:18.460
And it'll run in a DOS loopback, on ARM,

46:18.560 --> 46:19.960
you know, on all the things.

46:20.060 --> 46:22.240
Holy smokes. Wow. Yeah.

46:22.340 --> 46:26.340
This wasn't an extensive list of tiny distributions

46:26.440 --> 46:28.440
or like lightweight, but that's what we got.

46:28.540 --> 46:31.080
And MiniMecha, I wanted to get your take

46:31.080 --> 46:33.440
on which distribution here should be assigned

46:33.540 --> 46:35.080
the Convince a Co-Host award.

46:35.180 --> 46:38.860
The thing is, it looks like the Debian-based systems

46:38.960 --> 46:40.860
seem to be the winner because they are really,

46:40.960 --> 46:44.860
really flexible, and you can basically do whatever you want.

46:44.960 --> 46:46.560
You can have a full-fledged system,

46:46.660 --> 46:49.260
you can strict them down to the basics,

46:49.360 --> 46:51.760
but you're really flexible with Flatpak,

46:51.860 --> 46:53.500
Steam, everything you want.

46:53.600 --> 46:55.700
I think that's the takeaway from this episode,

46:55.800 --> 46:58.000
is when you do a lightweight, if you can afford it,

46:58.100 --> 47:00.640
it does require a little bit more disk space,

47:00.640 --> 47:02.580
but go Debian-based if you can,

47:02.680 --> 47:06.180
because that just opens up so, so much more software.

47:06.280 --> 47:08.980
It comes down now, I think, in my estimation,

47:09.080 --> 47:13.220
to Bunsen Labs and Sparky, if we go by the points

47:13.320 --> 47:16.520
and nobody assigns the Convince a Co-Host,

47:16.620 --> 47:20.300
then I think Drew has it at 47, and I'm coming in at 39.5.

47:20.400 --> 47:23.000
Cheese, you got 30 points. Wes, you got 40.

47:23.100 --> 47:26.500
I'm quite compelled, especially by Jill's testimony here today,

47:26.600 --> 47:27.800
about Sparky Linux.

47:27.800 --> 47:31.000
I'll admit, as much as I really have had fun with FreeBSD.

47:31.100 --> 47:32.240
Okay, I like what you're saying.

47:32.340 --> 47:34.300
But I think you've had the pulpit for a while,

47:34.400 --> 47:36.040
and Drew should get to go to bat, maybe,

47:36.140 --> 47:38.780
for some of the community or other aspects around his show.

47:38.880 --> 47:41.080
Yeah, I would like to hear more about the community around Bunsen.

47:41.180 --> 47:43.580
That's actually the thing that's gonna make me say

47:43.680 --> 47:45.960
that my vote actually will go to Sparky.

47:46.060 --> 47:47.460
Oh, no way!

47:47.560 --> 47:48.560
What?

47:48.660 --> 47:49.760
How dare you?

47:49.860 --> 47:51.860
As much as I love Bunsen Labs

47:51.960 --> 47:55.060
and really enjoyed my time with Helium,

47:55.060 --> 48:00.260
the pitch that you gave for the community around Sparky Linux

48:00.360 --> 48:02.800
really makes me appreciate it.

48:02.900 --> 48:05.900
It's not a distro that I had really checked out.

48:06.000 --> 48:09.040
I'm not familiar with Sparky at all,

48:09.140 --> 48:13.620
but I am curious, especially if the community is that driven.

48:13.720 --> 48:16.320
Community is such an important part to me,

48:16.420 --> 48:18.660
especially after everything that I went through

48:18.760 --> 48:22.320
with all of the investigations that I did for Choose Linux.

48:22.420 --> 48:24.020
Community is huge.

48:24.020 --> 48:27.700
And if the Sparky community is that involved,

48:27.800 --> 48:32.640
then it deserves my attention,

48:32.740 --> 48:34.140
just hands down.

48:34.240 --> 48:36.940
Now, I will say that between the two,

48:37.040 --> 48:38.740
Bunsen Labs and Sparky,

48:38.840 --> 48:41.940
do seem like they're on a fairly even playing field.

48:42.040 --> 48:43.980
I think you would have clinched it

48:44.080 --> 48:46.820
without any of the co-host points

48:46.920 --> 48:48.420
if you had installed the kernel.

48:48.520 --> 48:49.420
Yeah.

48:49.520 --> 48:51.120
Because, running Debian,

48:51.120 --> 48:54.020
you could have gotten Liquorix installed in five minutes.

48:54.120 --> 48:55.020
You could have done it.

48:55.120 --> 48:56.520
No, you're right. I should have.

48:56.620 --> 48:58.520
I just, I thought going into it,

48:58.620 --> 49:01.860
I was so impressed by how, because, skeptical Chris,

49:01.960 --> 49:03.060
I went into it thinking, you know,

49:03.160 --> 49:05.140
this must be one of those ego projects

49:05.240 --> 49:06.840
where nobody's paying attention,

49:06.940 --> 49:10.540
and boy, did I have that opinion corrected.

49:10.640 --> 49:13.240
And so I was so, I was so impressed by that

49:13.340 --> 49:14.840
because you just don't see it anymore.

49:14.940 --> 49:16.180
And I really thought to myself,

49:16.280 --> 49:18.780
this seems like something that will stick around for a while.

49:18.880 --> 49:20.280
Okay, now with that all said,

49:20.280 --> 49:22.780
does anyone in the mumble room want to chime in for Puppy?

49:22.880 --> 49:24.780
Because I know we have some advocates in there.

49:24.880 --> 49:26.760
Maybe we could do some convincing.

49:26.860 --> 49:28.360
Cheese could use a solid 10 points

49:28.460 --> 49:30.600
because right now he's at the bottom at 30.

49:30.700 --> 49:33.000
That would bring him up at least two tie with Wes.

49:33.100 --> 49:35.660
That depends on what kernel does Sparky come with.

49:35.760 --> 49:38.160
Puppy comes with 4.7 out of the box

49:38.260 --> 49:40.300
on the Bionic Pup version.

49:40.400 --> 49:41.600
Four seven?

49:41.700 --> 49:42.800
You know what you can say about that.

49:42.900 --> 49:44.040
It's not three.

49:44.140 --> 49:46.840
Mm, I can't even get that to boot on my system, man.

49:46.840 --> 49:50.420
But, you know, I mean, something that we need to consider too,

49:50.520 --> 49:51.840
right, is portability.

49:51.940 --> 49:54.020
So if you wanted to just throw this on a flash drive

49:54.120 --> 49:56.580
and say you had an old netbook kicking around,

49:56.680 --> 49:58.260
it would be a great distro for that.

49:58.360 --> 50:00.460
Dude, it doesn't matter if you can't boot it.

50:00.560 --> 50:06.360
Okay, it's really coming down to it.

50:06.460 --> 50:10.160
So Drew has thrown in behind Sparky Linux.

50:10.260 --> 50:11.640
That adds 10 points to me.

50:11.740 --> 50:13.500
Here's our current point lineup.

50:13.500 --> 50:17.040
I'm in the lead at 49.5 points.

50:17.140 --> 50:21.780
Drew has 47 points, Cheese has 30, Wes has 40.

50:21.880 --> 50:25.020
Mr. Cheese Bacon, which distribution would you like

50:25.120 --> 50:26.720
to consolidate behind?

50:26.820 --> 50:31.120
I'm definitely gonna go with Bunsen.

50:31.220 --> 50:32.320
Oh!

50:32.420 --> 50:34.060
And a lot of the reason behind that

50:34.160 --> 50:36.760
is because I was a huge Crunch Bang fan

50:36.860 --> 50:39.160
and the community around Crunch Bang was awesome

50:39.260 --> 50:43.160
back in the day and evolved into Bunsen.

50:43.160 --> 50:46.100
And I'm a huge fan of Openbox because, look,

50:46.200 --> 50:47.100
you got Openbox.

50:47.200 --> 50:48.440
You are so fired, man.

50:48.540 --> 50:49.900
You are so fired.

50:50.000 --> 50:55.980
You got Openbox, you got Trayer, you got Tint2.

50:56.080 --> 50:58.920
Everything is configurable by just a comp file.

50:59.020 --> 51:01.520
So just restart X and you're back.

51:01.620 --> 51:05.420
It's super easy, super extensible, modifiable.

51:05.520 --> 51:08.420
But I think in the future that we need to add

51:08.520 --> 51:09.660
to this points list.

51:09.760 --> 51:12.600
We need to add community and we also need to add

51:12.600 --> 51:15.260
documentation because there's a lot to be said

51:15.360 --> 51:18.500
about both of those things and how well distros

51:18.600 --> 51:19.500
implement those.

51:19.600 --> 51:20.500
Very true.

51:20.600 --> 51:21.700
Okay, all right.

51:21.800 --> 51:24.940
I think that is completely fair for future versions

51:25.040 --> 51:27.240
if we do this again, if we do the great bake-off.

51:27.340 --> 51:29.580
I think we have to bring pies for the next bake-off also.

51:29.680 --> 51:30.580
Ooh, I like that.

51:30.680 --> 51:31.580
I'll just talk about it.

51:31.680 --> 51:34.980
All right, okay, I need to brace myself.

51:35.080 --> 51:38.120
Westpain, you currently sit at 40 points.

51:38.220 --> 51:40.120
You're not gonna beat this thing.

51:40.120 --> 51:43.220
So you gotta, I think, you just gotta throw in

51:43.320 --> 51:45.500
behind a distribution.

51:45.600 --> 51:48.200
Drew currently sits at 57 points in the lead.

51:48.300 --> 51:51.640
I'm coming in the rear at 49.5.

51:51.740 --> 51:53.800
I thought maybe you were making a good case for

51:53.900 --> 51:59.200
getting behind the old Sparky, but I gotta admit

51:59.300 --> 52:01.540
there's a good case for Bunsen too.

52:01.640 --> 52:04.540
Westpain, where are you throwing your host endorsement?

52:04.640 --> 52:07.580
Well, what I want to do is give it to CalibriOS

52:07.580 --> 52:11.480
to get it to 29 points, so it's a little more respectable.

52:11.580 --> 52:14.360
But, I mean, I think having listened to Jill

52:14.460 --> 52:17.820
and just a ton of stuff I see over there on the IRC,

52:17.920 --> 52:20.700
yeah, all right, I have to go with Sparky.

52:20.800 --> 52:23.700
Oh, my goodness, are you serious right now?

52:23.800 --> 52:24.700
Are you serious?

52:24.800 --> 52:25.940
Is that your final answer there, Westpain?

52:26.040 --> 52:27.240
That is my final support.

52:27.340 --> 52:34.240
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

52:34.240 --> 52:37.580
That barely puts me in the lead at 59.5.

52:37.680 --> 52:40.880
I take the win there, just barely for Sparky Linux.

52:40.980 --> 52:44.080
Not for me, but for the developers of Sparky Linux

52:44.180 --> 52:46.920
who have worked so hard to make a great distribution

52:47.020 --> 52:48.760
with a strong community following.

52:48.860 --> 52:52.860
It is that community, not me, that put it over the edge here.

52:52.960 --> 52:57.000
And I also want to thank my mom and my kids.

52:57.100 --> 52:58.560
You know, I saw you booting it up a little, really.

52:58.660 --> 53:00.900
It's only because it had a nice looking boot animation.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.340
I saw that across the room and I was like,

53:02.340 --> 53:04.200
ah, that's going to have to be.

53:04.300 --> 53:07.680
And also, the dark mode is slick looking, isn't it?

53:07.780 --> 53:08.980
Isn't that nice?

53:09.080 --> 53:10.240
Yeah, they really nailed it.

53:10.340 --> 53:13.180
Now, the only thing that kept us from being a blowout

53:13.280 --> 53:17.180
was that you had a gambit to not do the alternate kernel

53:17.280 --> 53:21.460
and instead rely solely on your last minute

53:21.560 --> 53:26.060
addition of a points entry for convincing your co-host.

53:26.160 --> 53:29.760
You know, the thing is, I am a natural salesman,

53:29.760 --> 53:32.260
so I thought that could be a strength.

53:32.360 --> 53:35.240
But also, I knew you guys, because you all

53:35.340 --> 53:38.440
are long-term Linux users, you know that a strong community

53:38.540 --> 53:40.740
is vital to make a distribution successful.

53:40.840 --> 53:42.540
And I knew I'd get you on that point.

53:42.640 --> 53:43.380
Dammit.

53:43.480 --> 53:45.780
Ah.

53:45.880 --> 53:47.880
If I was a co-host, I would have actually thrown it

53:47.980 --> 53:50.620
towards Bunsen because it's actually

53:50.720 --> 53:53.020
outlasted a distribution now.

53:53.120 --> 53:53.860
That's fair.

53:53.960 --> 53:55.460
You know, longevity does count.

53:55.560 --> 53:57.220
And Cheese did, I think to Cheese's credit,

53:57.320 --> 53:59.360
he did throw in his 10 points.

53:59.360 --> 54:01.220
Drew, you really almost got it at 57.

54:01.320 --> 54:05.400
And I think with the takeaway there is Bunsen or Sparky

54:05.500 --> 54:06.700
is actually really great.

54:06.800 --> 54:08.700
They're both worth giving a try after you listen to this episode.

54:08.800 --> 54:10.340
And they both have great names.

54:10.440 --> 54:11.500
There's that.

54:11.600 --> 54:13.640
And the really thing to take away from it

54:13.740 --> 54:14.940
is that they're Debian-based.

54:15.040 --> 54:16.940
And that really seems to be the winning recipe.

54:17.040 --> 54:19.880
And what a rich ecosystem has spawned from Debian, you know?

54:19.980 --> 54:21.220
I mean, like, it itself is great,

54:21.320 --> 54:23.280
and then you've just got this whole world

54:23.380 --> 54:26.420
of other creative, interesting options that are useful.

54:26.420 --> 54:29.420
Well, let's begin to wrap it up right here.

54:29.520 --> 54:32.220
If you've got any show ideas or feedback or concerns,

54:32.320 --> 54:33.720
considerations, or anything else,

54:33.820 --> 54:36.400
go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

54:36.500 --> 54:38.700
For links to the distributions we talked about and whatnot

54:38.800 --> 54:43.140
today, you can go to linuxunplugged.com slash 357.

54:43.240 --> 54:46.040
The show is at Linux Unplugged on Twitter.

54:46.140 --> 54:48.680
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

54:48.780 --> 54:50.180
Mr. Payne, where can they find you?

54:50.280 --> 54:51.440
At Westpane.

54:51.540 --> 54:52.680
How about that? That's easy.

54:52.780 --> 54:53.580
Easy to remember.

54:53.680 --> 54:55.640
Drew, Cheese, where can they find you guys?

54:55.640 --> 54:59.580
I'm at DrewofDoom on Twitter, at Cheese Bacon.

54:59.680 --> 55:00.960
God, I can't believe that, Cheese Bacon.

55:01.060 --> 55:02.160
That's so good.

55:02.260 --> 55:04.660
You know what, you could build an empire around that name.

55:04.760 --> 55:06.260
All right, we are live on Tuesdays,

55:06.360 --> 55:07.700
except for when I'm on the road.

55:07.800 --> 55:09.360
That calendar is JupiterBroadcasting.com

55:09.460 --> 55:10.460
slash calendar.

55:10.560 --> 55:12.160
We appreciate you joining us live.

55:12.260 --> 55:13.940
Thanks so much for tuning in to this week's episode

55:14.040 --> 55:15.160
of the Unplugged program.

55:15.260 --> 55:18.540
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

55:18.540 --> 55:28.540
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

55:49.540 --> 55:51.140
So this whole challenge was flawed

55:51.240 --> 55:53.740
because there was no Arch involved in this conversation.

55:53.840 --> 55:55.440
And there was no Fedora either.

55:55.540 --> 55:57.640
Yeah, Arch is the smallest.

55:57.740 --> 56:02.140
Well, you know, we just kind of, we had a list of distributions

56:02.240 --> 56:04.240
and we just tumbled them all up and assigned them.

56:04.340 --> 56:07.080
It wasn't like a comprehensive, but you're right.

56:07.180 --> 56:09.720
Something Arch-based would probably do very well.

56:09.820 --> 56:11.920
And I could see something Fedora-based.

56:12.020 --> 56:15.720
I don't think that is, I don't think that's a good idea.

56:15.720 --> 56:19.260
Something Fedora-based, I don't think that is so much

56:19.360 --> 56:22.260
as oversight as it is an opportunity for future content.

56:22.360 --> 56:23.260
More backups.

56:23.260 --> 56:46.260
Yep, yep.
