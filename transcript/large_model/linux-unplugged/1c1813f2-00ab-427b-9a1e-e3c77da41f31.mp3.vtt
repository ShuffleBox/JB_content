WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.980
The internet cannot figure out how to quit them. How do you get out of him? Well friends

00:07.180 --> 00:11.060
How about a simple tool West pain brings us the Vim killer?

00:11.060 --> 00:16.400
I mean I was thinking of you here Chris because as you know, I'd like to alias

00:17.180 --> 00:23.120
Nano-2 Vim on really any system that you're gonna come across. So why not install a hardware kill switch?

00:23.120 --> 00:26.440
You're familiar with the mute pedal you've got down below you for taking a cough

00:26.440 --> 00:31.680
But what about when you run into trouble with your least favorite editor? I can never get out of it

00:31.680 --> 00:35.040
It's just too darn hard. If only there was an easier way

00:35.120 --> 00:40.380
Well Vim killer is a button on top of an Arduino wrapped in a 3d printed enclosure

00:41.440 --> 00:48.120
It's expertly crafted and with one button click you can finally quit them. What could be easier?

00:48.120 --> 00:51.060
I just 3d print a case build a tiny computer

00:51.060 --> 00:56.900
Install software develop that software connect it to my host system and set up software on that side

00:56.900 --> 01:03.860
And then when I'm all done one button press to end Vim, it's easy and yet it's still easier than learning Vim

01:15.260 --> 01:18.140
Hello friends, welcome to Linux unplugged episode

01:18.140 --> 01:23.980
355 my name is Chris. My name is Wes. There's no kill button for this show Wes

01:24.180 --> 01:29.340
This is just too much show. I'm a wounded soldier. I'll tell you my tale of whoa

01:29.340 --> 01:36.380
I'm how I managed to completely bork up my home server last night and Wes discovered a rogue device on his network

01:36.380 --> 01:38.900
We'll tell you how he managed to track that down

01:38.900 --> 01:45.020
We have a bunch of community news and some feedback, but before we get into that we have some pleasantries

01:45.020 --> 01:51.660
I'd like to say hello to mr. Cheese bacon and drew. Hello, gentlemen. Thanks for joining me. Hello internet. Hello. Hello guys

01:51.660 --> 01:56.900
Hello, you know, this is nice you me and Wes here could just have a little picnic while we do this

01:56.900 --> 02:03.380
We should do that sometime a podcast picnic. We'll all order the same meal have it right here snacking, but don't get it on Mike

02:03.540 --> 02:08.880
Yeah, although we'd have to figure out a way to include that virtual log time appropriate greetings bumble room

02:08.880 --> 02:15.200
Hello did a bunch of you sneak in during the intro

02:15.200 --> 02:21.340
I feel like I feel like that's a lot of people that weren't in there before but it's good to see all of you

02:21.760 --> 02:23.760
Welcome into the show. I

02:24.080 --> 02:28.560
Apologize. I'm a little sad today because of a data loss situation that happened last night

02:28.560 --> 02:35.880
And of course, I spent the morning refusing to accept what happened trying to recover the file system data loss. You said data loss

02:35.880 --> 02:42.280
Yeah, I am so sorry before we get there. This actually is really cool. We were joking around in the pre-show

02:42.280 --> 02:47.640
I mean, it's silly but this VIM killer button on top of an Arduino wrapped in a 3d printed enclosure

02:47.640 --> 02:53.700
I kind of like this idea for just a general close the application function if you could expand it beyond VIM

02:53.720 --> 02:58.360
So it supported any application and you just hit that red button and we'll put a link in the show notes

02:58.360 --> 03:02.680
You guys can see this you just hit that red button and it just closes whatever app you're using right there

03:02.680 --> 03:05.960
Maybe it just kills it even how great would that be kill it?

03:05.960 --> 03:12.360
What if I told you that you could easily do that with a few buttons and like an Arduino Pro Micro?

03:12.840 --> 03:16.420
What is it the El Gato that all the streamers use these days? Yeah, right

03:16.420 --> 03:21.500
you can do the same thing with just a little Arduino Pro Micro which can act as a

03:21.780 --> 03:25.600
Hit device and boom that should be kind of a fun segment

03:25.600 --> 03:29.600
You know, what else would be fun is to make a homemade OBS

03:29.600 --> 03:34.700
Streamer rig switcher kind of thing that is way cheaper than that El Gato because that El Gato

03:35.560 --> 03:41.800
OLED or whatever it is panel is like $300 and I don't even think it works with Linux. I might be wrong

03:41.800 --> 03:47.020
I've never tried it because it's so expensive. That's why you got to go with cheese brand products. That's right. I got you fam

03:48.400 --> 03:53.200
Cheese printed and approved. Yeah, I think the El Gato works with Linux under OBS

03:53.200 --> 03:56.980
But I think to program the buttons you need Mac or Windows. I've never really tried it

03:56.980 --> 04:02.840
I'd be curious to know if anybody has this is the streamers life. So anyways, let's talk about a little community news

04:02.840 --> 04:05.760
We really just have one story. We wanted to dig into although

04:06.320 --> 04:08.920
There are many maybe next week

04:08.920 --> 04:15.200
We'll cover what happened with the gnome foundation and their patent suit, but I'm waiting to get a little more details on that

04:15.200 --> 04:19.720
I'm hoping to get more information. So let's talk about this Raspberry Pi firmware update

04:19.720 --> 04:25.280
I got a lot of people telling me about this one people knew I was looking out for this. This is an update

04:25.280 --> 04:27.760
That will be official eventually right now

04:27.760 --> 04:32.800
It's in beta that enables the Raspberry Pi 4 to boot from a USB SSD

04:33.280 --> 04:37.200
No SD card required at all, which we were just recently talking about Wes

04:37.200 --> 04:42.800
Yeah, that's maybe where it's a little bit confusing because I mean you and I have already been talking about using a you know

04:42.800 --> 04:45.240
USB mass storage device for your root file system

04:45.440 --> 04:51.040
But you've still got to have the bootloader and all the requisite files sitting on that SD

04:51.040 --> 04:57.320
But really since launch Raspberry Pi 4, I mean there's been promised functionality around the booting

04:57.800 --> 05:01.800
Directly, you know right off with no SD card required right from USB

05:02.520 --> 05:08.260
Finally as of I think May 15th, there's a firmware out that lets you do just that

05:08.440 --> 05:15.940
Well that is if you can get that firmware installed. So in theory a very simple process you edit a

05:15.940 --> 05:23.140
Raspberry Pi EEPROM update file and there's just one line in there about firmware release status

05:23.140 --> 05:25.140
and you change it from critical to beta and

05:25.860 --> 05:32.620
Then you do an apt-get update and there's a package that gets updated and they're called rpi-eprom and that package

05:32.900 --> 05:35.740
Will pull down the latest firmware and put it on the file system

05:35.740 --> 05:42.540
And then there's a pretty easy rpi-eprom update command where you just point it at that bin file

05:42.540 --> 05:46.860
That's now sitting on your file system and it writes it to the Raspberry Pi's firmware

05:47.180 --> 05:52.480
You reboot and then in theory from that point forward it will boot from a USB device

05:52.740 --> 05:55.600
For us on my test Pi because I've got one

05:55.780 --> 05:59.020
Just on the bench here at the studio that I use for testing these kinds of things now

05:59.020 --> 06:04.940
This is how you know that you're using these pies in production is you've got a whole staging environment set up for your pie

06:04.940 --> 06:10.420
You're dang right Wes. I'm taking this serious here. I'm not gonna deploy beta firmware on my production devices

06:10.420 --> 06:13.380
That's what operating systems are for I admit

06:13.380 --> 06:19.860
I did put it Ubuntu 20.04 on my pies before it was released, but that was different several weeks before

06:20.980 --> 06:25.980
Okay. Yeah, but I'm not doing this firmware, but I will put it on this test device and this is kind of a nice candidate

06:25.980 --> 06:27.780
I got it

06:27.780 --> 06:31.700
Two three weeks ago, and I have a fresh Raspbian

06:32.220 --> 06:35.500
SD card on there and I got a fresh SSD on there

06:35.500 --> 06:39.780
so it's like the perfect candidate to try this firmware and you and I both gave it a go and

06:39.780 --> 06:44.620
No matter what we did it would write the new firmware in theory

06:44.620 --> 06:49.660
It would seem to and then it would say okay reboot for it to take effect and you would reboot or power off power cycle

06:49.660 --> 06:53.740
And it would still be the old firmware. Yeah, I'm not quite sure what's going on

06:53.740 --> 06:55.900
I mean, I think to the best of our knowledge

06:55.900 --> 07:03.540
We followed both the official advice and there's a handy article that sort of summarizes things skip some of the intermediate steps over at Tom's

07:03.540 --> 07:08.260
Hardware and in theory the new firmware includes a bunch of defaults that you know

07:08.260 --> 07:14.580
Sort of do exactly what you want. They try the SD card and then well if there's no SD card boot from USB

07:14.740 --> 07:16.580
so all you have to do is

07:16.580 --> 07:23.080
Install the new firmware and let it use its defaults to overwrite any sort of bootloader customizations. You've got installed

07:23.500 --> 07:25.180
That's one command

07:25.180 --> 07:31.020
But after rebooting we got nothing nada. Yeah, and I'm not

07:31.020 --> 07:38.860
really urgently trying to fix this because for me having just slash boot on the SD card and then the

07:39.100 --> 07:42.060
rest of the file system on a USB SSD is

07:43.140 --> 07:47.000
Perfectly functional, you know, that's one of the things that's using Linux

07:47.000 --> 07:51.820
Like that's that's a behavior that's entirely supported in all of the models we have

07:51.820 --> 07:56.180
So like just having this separate little boot drive is really not a big deal

07:56.180 --> 08:02.940
It's just sort of they mentioned that this support would exist and you know, therefore we want it now

08:02.940 --> 08:08.380
I have a tale of woe about my Raspberry Pi home server last night if you want the full like

08:09.140 --> 08:13.940
Multi-pi setup all of that. It's well documented in the self-hosted podcast. So I'll just make that disclaimer

08:13.940 --> 08:15.940
So some of this is a shortened version. Oh

08:16.580 --> 08:19.060
God, I'm so sad about this is actually still hard to talk about

08:19.500 --> 08:25.640
So some context is soon I'm heading out in Lady Choups my RV to go to Austin

08:25.640 --> 08:30.240
it'll be about a nine-day drive down there because we'll be stopping a bit along the way and

08:30.840 --> 08:33.360
Then I'll be there for about a week and then I'm driving back

08:33.680 --> 08:38.260
And so that's a long time and I'm bringing my three kids with me. You've got a full load. Yeah

08:39.040 --> 08:40.440
seriously and

08:40.440 --> 08:45.400
Including production gear wife and dog and that's food and clothes for all of us

08:45.400 --> 08:50.080
I mean it really is a full load and it's a lot of time on the road and I wanted to

08:50.080 --> 08:57.280
Sort of re-engineer my home storage setup. So that way I could get it ready for this and during the luck lug

08:57.600 --> 08:59.840
Neal convinced me I should try butter fs

08:59.840 --> 09:03.400
I was gonna use merger fs for my cousin and I thought if it worked out well for him

09:03.600 --> 09:06.000
I'd use merger fs at home to accomplish this

09:06.880 --> 09:12.560
Okay, but there's a way to do with butter fs and it seemed like a superior route to go and it probably is I'm going

09:12.560 --> 09:13.280
To still try to do it

09:13.280 --> 09:13.920
I

09:13.920 --> 09:16.560
Come into the situation kind of in a rush

09:16.560 --> 09:21.840
because I'm trying to get everything ready to go and get more storage copied over and trying to just get it done really fast and

09:21.840 --> 09:23.840
So I ended up doing it late at night

09:24.040 --> 09:29.800
But I probably shouldn't have because I had that thought crossed my mind like I'm not feeling my sharpest right now

09:29.800 --> 09:35.520
Been a long day been on you know, some zoom meetings during the workday, and this is probably about 930 at night

09:35.520 --> 09:40.320
So that's late for me. I mean that's the only time you have right where you're just like I'm sitting here

09:40.320 --> 09:46.880
I'm thinking about the problem. I should just fix it right now. I have to drop the RV off for some work before we leave so

09:46.880 --> 09:51.760
I only have it for a couple of more days before we're gone. So I really only have like like last night to do it

09:52.320 --> 09:53.760
Although it's gonna be tonight, too

09:53.760 --> 09:58.400
So I'm doing it later than I should but my idea was is I need to shut down a couple of my raspberry pies

09:58.400 --> 10:04.500
They're producing too much heat and I want to shut down two of them and consolidate the functionality onto one

10:04.800 --> 10:06.360
I'll shut down one of them

10:06.360 --> 10:11.600
I removed the hard drive and on this hard drive contained all of my media for home like

10:11.760 --> 10:16.120
movies and television and all of that and my Docker containers and

10:17.160 --> 10:18.960
You know all their data

10:18.960 --> 10:25.040
All my other like my compose stuff and really there's nothing else installed on the host OS that I have separately

10:25.720 --> 10:29.520
And of course, I have backups going for all of this. I'll make that disclaimer up here

10:30.240 --> 10:34.720
so I disconnect the drive hook it up to the new Raspberry Pi that I'm going to be consolidating to and

10:34.720 --> 10:41.040
I'm doing all of this through an SSH session on my laptop and it's about a

10:41.560 --> 10:43.000
45 to

10:43.000 --> 10:49.120
50-minute conversion process when you run the butter FS convert from extended for so I sit down to run this because I know it's gonna

10:49.120 --> 10:51.120
Be a bit. Oh you're converting

10:51.720 --> 10:55.440
Hmm. I mean that's a feature that is advertised, right?

10:55.520 --> 11:02.400
Yeah, and it in theory is a fairly straightforward process unless you manage to screw it up in the dumbest way possible like I did

11:02.400 --> 11:06.880
Interestingly enough no matter what I did the new USB device

11:06.880 --> 11:11.200
I hooked up would show up as dev SDA and my root now became dev SDB

11:11.200 --> 11:15.200
But because I'm using labels for all my mounts and for my bootloader

11:15.760 --> 11:22.480
Everything was fine. I tried changing different USB ports and I moved the new disk to a hub and

11:23.120 --> 11:27.400
The the main root disk to the still plugged into the back of the Raspberry Pi

11:27.400 --> 11:31.600
So it should be like directly connected to the pie and it still shows up as dev SDB

11:31.600 --> 11:33.600
It's fine

11:33.680 --> 11:38.980
So I had to verify I was working with the right disk and I was it I verified it was dev SDA

11:39.400 --> 11:46.300
So I set off to do the butter fest conversion. Step one is I did a full check disk, you know fsdk, whatever

11:46.840 --> 11:49.340
Made sure that the extended for system was in good shape

11:50.240 --> 11:54.640
Verified everything was right made sure everything was unmounted. This sounds so responsible

11:54.640 --> 12:00.680
I kick off the butter a fast conversion and you know, it's going it's going it's on a Raspberry Pi over USB

12:00.680 --> 12:04.160
So it's gonna take quite a while. So I decide I

12:04.840 --> 12:08.840
Should probably start working on luck, you know, it's gonna be tomorrow morning. I'm gonna need to have a show ready to go

12:08.840 --> 12:12.760
I should probably work on it. I start opening him up the dock

12:12.760 --> 12:17.200
I start working on and things are just they're going real slow with and this is where

12:18.320 --> 12:19.680
impatience and

12:19.680 --> 12:21.320
time crunch and

12:21.320 --> 12:25.080
Sleepiness came together and I made a horrible mistake

12:25.080 --> 12:28.400
Oh, no, and then that was compounded by another failure

12:28.400 --> 12:35.000
so first stupid thing I did is I was trying to load some web pages to do some show research and just the internet was

12:35.000 --> 12:40.240
So throttled up where I'm at at this campsite that I just couldn't even get a web page to load literally could not even load

12:40.240 --> 12:45.440
Web pages so I decided yeah screw this I'm going to tether from my phone

12:45.440 --> 12:50.360
Yeah, you've got this LTE plan you pay for yeah, and the Wi-Fi is running on my phone all the time

12:50.360 --> 12:52.360
So I just jump Wi-Fi networks

12:52.360 --> 12:58.440
Boom pages start loading. I immediately start filling out information in the dock about a minute or two into it

12:58.440 --> 13:00.200
I don't know. I lost track of time

13:00.200 --> 13:03.400
All of a sudden I just stopped. I have this realization. Oh

13:04.040 --> 13:10.780
No, I've just just connected from my SSH session in which I was running a file system conversion

13:11.080 --> 13:16.520
What have I just done the heaviness of that hits me? No screen or team X session in play

13:16.520 --> 13:22.360
No, I have and this is something I'm going to work on now. I have developed a habit of

13:22.840 --> 13:27.920
Always using in the past it was screen and now it's been team X or even teammates sometimes

13:27.920 --> 13:31.920
I think teammates pretty great too for when I'm trying to share whenever I'm in a remote session

13:31.920 --> 13:37.680
I at least have mosh and I'm almost always using screen or team X now

13:37.680 --> 13:38.440
That's just a habit

13:38.440 --> 13:44.000
I've built up anytime I'm remote because I'm on this my fi so often that connections are are unreliable

13:44.000 --> 13:49.160
But for whatever reason when I'm on the LAN and it doesn't matter if it's a box here at the studio or if it's at

13:49.160 --> 13:51.160
lady jupes when I'm on the LAN I

13:51.760 --> 13:58.720
Just don't think to use those tools because I'm on the LAN. It's not going anywhere. It's steady. It's stable, right?

13:58.720 --> 14:01.640
You're not leaving. So your session won't break, right? I

14:02.520 --> 14:08.200
Realized the mistakes that are stacking at the moment. So I switch back over to the local LAN

14:08.760 --> 14:11.360
Bring the terminal up then I just sit there

14:11.360 --> 14:15.400
Does it say anything does anything happen? Do I get dropped back to my local box?

14:15.920 --> 14:19.480
So I hit enter and it returns to the command prompt with no air

14:19.480 --> 14:24.820
But I'm still logged in like it resumed the session. I'm not using mosh. It just resumed the session

14:24.820 --> 14:27.960
I don't know like if it timed out or what because it might it be

14:27.960 --> 14:32.200
I don't know. It's all happened really fast in this point because I was beginning to freak out

14:33.160 --> 14:36.600
You know calmly freak out, but I was really starting to worry. And so I

14:36.600 --> 14:42.720
I immediately thought well, I believe the way the conversion works is it really doesn't do

14:43.080 --> 14:47.520
The final stuff until the end and if I interrupted it mid conversion

14:47.520 --> 14:49.080
It's building that tree

14:49.080 --> 14:55.440
But it hasn't switched over to the butter FS file system yet. And so perhaps the extended file system is still fine

14:55.760 --> 15:01.480
So I run another check. I run an extended for file system check comes back clean

15:01.480 --> 15:06.160
Oh, did you see any processes still running from your previous command Wes?

15:06.160 --> 15:10.800
I was in a fugue state. I was in a fugue state Wes. I was like, oh no, what's happening, right?

15:10.800 --> 15:17.220
And plus it's like 10 o'clock at night now and I'm exhausted because it's been a long day and I it was Memorial Day

15:17.220 --> 15:20.240
And so I was I did a bunch of chores which I felt really awesome about

15:20.400 --> 15:23.680
Reorganized a bunch of our storage to get it road ready felt awesome

15:24.000 --> 15:28.120
Have like a two-hour power hour meeting felt drained as hell from that

15:28.120 --> 15:33.400
like just you know, one of those big days and then I'm working on this after a big big meal, which was

15:33.400 --> 15:38.340
Delicious, but also draining. This is where I should have stopped

15:38.960 --> 15:43.880
Because the extended for check came back clean, but I thought to myself I got to get this done

15:44.400 --> 15:52.760
I'll run butter if s convert again, and I'm sure if something screwed up the tooling will give me some kind of air

15:54.560 --> 15:58.760
This doesn't sound good you can tell I was exhausted so I set it up to go I said

15:58.760 --> 16:03.280
You know caffeine the little gnome extension caffeine I click that so that way my laptop stays awake all night long

16:03.920 --> 16:05.920
You got it running this time

16:06.320 --> 16:07.760
in T mugs

16:07.760 --> 16:13.020
Ready to go Ethernet with into the into the cabinet like I am dialed in man

16:13.020 --> 16:17.880
I am NOT letting anything happen again, right my head enter and it's going and I'm sitting there. I'm

16:19.360 --> 16:23.640
They and it's just sitting there clock just no feedback cuz it's just creating image or whatever

16:23.640 --> 16:27.920
It says and I decided I'm going to bed and I set my alarm for 545 a.m

16:27.920 --> 16:29.400
Because I figure I'll get up

16:29.400 --> 16:32.840
Try to finish the work and then run into the studio for the show because you know

16:32.840 --> 16:35.360
It's quite a bit of a long drive. So I gotta like get up early

16:35.360 --> 16:40.960
So I set the alarm clock I wake up before the alarm goes off a half hour before my alarm goes off

16:40.960 --> 16:42.680
I'm up and I'm working on this thing

16:42.680 --> 16:48.200
I'm sitting there chugging a Red Bull while I'm like one hand on the keyboard the other hand slamming a Red Bull

16:48.200 --> 16:53.840
I'm down to clown like getting this thing going look at the output of the butter FS convert

16:53.840 --> 16:58.360
Completed successfully. It's got all the stuff on there that all the guides say should have

16:58.880 --> 17:03.760
Looks good to go. I'm thinking at this point. Oh my god, it worked

17:04.120 --> 17:09.040
It didn't do it until the very end which I interrupted so that way it just started over from scratch and it took hours

17:09.040 --> 17:13.840
So I you know, I assumed it must have it's gotta be good. So I think okay now it comes down to this

17:14.520 --> 17:17.840
Mount file system. I get an error that it can't be mounted

17:17.840 --> 17:20.520
I checked the logs a bunch of layers are in there

17:20.520 --> 17:27.440
But one of the ones that I've pulled out now after running butter FS repair and check is could not find extended items for root

17:27.800 --> 17:30.800
256 that just keeps coming up every time I do a check

17:31.240 --> 17:37.560
So I brought it into the studio. I ran like all the rescue things against it. I ran all the different stuff

17:37.560 --> 17:41.280
I cannot get this file system back up. It's there. You can see the size of it

17:41.280 --> 17:46.580
You can see how much is used, but you can't get to the data. It's infuriating and it starts to dawn on me

17:46.580 --> 17:53.020
I'm gonna need to recover. All right, let's start that process. I've got backups. Oh, what a mental shift though, right?

17:53.020 --> 17:56.180
You're like, okay. Well this system is lost

17:56.340 --> 18:01.300
What do I have in backups and maybe you know, I still I have all my docker compose files

18:01.300 --> 18:06.660
I've I've got the configuration and backup and the media files. I have other copies of then

18:06.660 --> 18:08.660
These are not my only copies of them

18:08.820 --> 18:12.320
So I can recover so I go to login to Google Drive

18:12.320 --> 18:20.100
Download my last duplicati backup, which happens every night at 3 a.m. So I was just gonna go get the previous night's backup and

18:21.140 --> 18:23.140
I see a red bar

18:23.620 --> 18:26.260
at the bottom of my Google Drive

18:26.940 --> 18:32.700
Where it says I am using eight hundred and eighty six gigabytes of 15 gigabytes allocated

18:33.700 --> 18:36.020
Yeah, you see back in March

18:36.020 --> 18:41.780
My debit card expired and the way Google works is you can go add your new form of payment

18:41.780 --> 18:46.540
Maybe you have a YouTube bread or a YouTube television or Google Play subscription

18:46.540 --> 18:49.180
You can go add it back to one of those services

18:49.180 --> 18:54.340
But it will not add the payment information to all of the services

18:54.340 --> 18:59.980
So my Google Photos, for example like that stuff in there, which I still have those old photos on there

18:59.980 --> 19:02.900
I want I still want them stored on there. That's why that number is so large

19:02.900 --> 19:09.460
My YouTube premium my YouTube TV each one of them. I had to reactivate individually

19:09.460 --> 19:13.660
I guess I just didn't think that I would need to go manually check on Drive

19:13.660 --> 19:16.300
I thought I would get some sort of email saying hey, man

19:16.860 --> 19:19.420
your Google Drive storage subscription is up and

19:20.580 --> 19:27.460
You're using eight hundred and fifty gigabytes or eight hundred and seventy almost gigabytes of space and you're only you're only getting 15 right now

19:27.460 --> 19:30.460
Can we do something about this? None of that. I didn't get none of that

19:30.460 --> 19:36.340
I had no indication that duplicati wasn't saving to drive lesson

19:36.340 --> 19:41.260
What we learned here never using Google Drive again. I was simply using it because I'd already paid for it ages ago

19:41.260 --> 19:45.820
So why pay for something else? I thought so my backups are basically

19:47.340 --> 19:53.540
Beginning of March for all of my configuration my plex history my smoke ping history

19:54.020 --> 19:56.820
Configuration all of it is basically

19:56.820 --> 20:02.580
March because nothing was generating errors neither duplicati nor Google Drive

20:05.060 --> 20:10.460
So I don't have anything current so I'm gonna have to re stand up all the applications and

20:12.100 --> 20:14.100
Recopy over all the media files

20:14.540 --> 20:16.540
while I'm trying to get out of town and

20:16.660 --> 20:23.340
it stinks because it's months and months and months and months of tweaking and perfecting and

20:23.340 --> 20:27.700
Also kind of a blow to this is all of my documentation

20:28.460 --> 20:34.940
Was on that system. Oh, no. Yeah, and I could restore like the March backups, which I will but anything you've done

20:34.940 --> 20:39.220
You know all the helpful hints you've added. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm

20:40.100 --> 20:45.940
Ironically, I needed that documentation this morning and I had written it locally on on my desktop. So I just had it

20:46.660 --> 20:48.300
But it was like here I was this morning

20:48.300 --> 20:52.180
I already needed that documentation because I was installing software on Dylan's laptop remotely

20:52.180 --> 20:55.260
and I you know needed my credentials and all that it's just such a shame because

20:55.980 --> 21:01.340
it was such a dumb mistake ultimately my mistake was not using something like screen and

21:02.020 --> 21:03.780
Then switching networks like that

21:03.780 --> 21:09.980
And then I think you could back it up one level and saying I even had that moment of I'm not really at my best

21:09.980 --> 21:12.500
Right now I can tell I'm a little tired a little punchy

21:12.700 --> 21:18.540
but I had thought this through for days and I had it all written out all the steps that I was going to take and

21:18.540 --> 21:22.220
I had it all just sort of by the numbers at this point that I thought I

21:22.780 --> 21:25.100
Mean all I have to do is just follow my list of procedures

21:25.100 --> 21:29.520
like I'd already kind of gone through and looked at all the commands I was gonna run and how I was gonna structure it on this

21:29.520 --> 21:33.700
New machine and kind of just made notes for myself to follow. So I thought I'm good to go

21:34.300 --> 21:39.760
But what happened was is I was that impatience and being under too much of a time constraint

21:40.260 --> 21:44.900
And the slowness of the internet where I was at because I'm out of my fight. It was way throttled

21:44.900 --> 21:50.180
I thought you know, I'll just switch over. I'll do show prep while this conversion goes for an hour or so

21:50.260 --> 21:58.260
You were trying to optimize. Yeah, and I think the lesson learned there too is when you're doing something at the file system level is

21:58.900 --> 22:03.700
Excruciating as it might be just I got other systems. I could have used I could have used other computers

22:03.700 --> 22:05.940
I just that's a unit asker at that point

22:05.940 --> 22:10.780
I think it's hard because we've done so much to move things off that sort of unit asker model and

22:10.780 --> 22:16.260
Most of the operations you do I'm especially if you have backups, you know, they're not unreplayable

22:16.260 --> 22:20.060
you can go back in time or you've you've got the backups for it, but a

22:20.780 --> 22:28.180
Giant media filled file system is one of those. It's too expensive. You know, so you you have fewer copies of it

22:28.180 --> 22:31.780
Yeah, I think I'm still going to go this route that I was set it out

22:31.780 --> 22:34.260
I'm still gonna go with butter FS on this disk

22:34.260 --> 22:41.820
because as Neil pointed out when I was comparing it to possibly using merger FS is it's pretty straightforward to take a new disc

22:41.820 --> 22:46.520
Add it to the system and then just add that storage to an existing mount point

22:46.940 --> 22:49.020
and you can do that with rate or without and

22:50.340 --> 22:53.780
that to me is a very compelling way to just grow and grow a

22:54.140 --> 22:59.800
Media storage pool by doing this butter fs volume ad or disk ad whatever it is when you look at

22:59.800 --> 23:05.160
What is feasible on an ARM device like a Raspberry Pi or a pine 64?

23:05.640 --> 23:10.040
the overhead of a file system like ZFS doesn't seem very reasonable and

23:10.480 --> 23:14.760
Extended for an XFS are absolutely totally great and usable

23:14.960 --> 23:18.800
But maybe you want something a little more like maybe you want snapshots

23:18.800 --> 23:24.380
Or maybe you want this ability to just add additional disk storage and you want to integrate it at the file system level

23:24.380 --> 23:29.820
Then butter fs becomes a pretty compelling option on something like the Raspberry Pi. And so I think

23:30.940 --> 23:32.300
Even with this experience

23:32.300 --> 23:37.020
I think I would I'm still gonna move forward if there was one thing that I wish butter fs could have done for me

23:37.020 --> 23:39.140
Because this was really all 100% my fault

23:39.220 --> 23:44.660
But if there's one thing is maybe that file system conversion tool could have had some

23:45.620 --> 23:50.620
Checking because the file system was never usable like when it said all done everything good to go

23:50.620 --> 23:56.700
It what it didn't leave me with a usable file system and maybe there could have been some kind of error checking or butter

23:56.700 --> 24:02.940
Fs repair scan that happens in there or something to give the user feedback saying this isn't a functional file system

24:02.940 --> 24:04.980
I just gave you it wouldn't have changed anything

24:05.020 --> 24:09.700
But it seemed like an opportunity for the tooling to be slightly better in that regard right you were left thinking

24:09.700 --> 24:10.420
Oh, yeah

24:10.420 --> 24:14.220
I I have a usable file system that I can just go go work with now

24:14.740 --> 24:19.380
Instead of having some sort of universal way to query like is there still a conversion in progress?

24:19.380 --> 24:22.540
What's happening with my file system and should I touch it yet? Yeah

24:23.140 --> 24:27.020
It's just oh, oh Wes. I'm so sorry, but that's enough

24:27.580 --> 24:30.700
File system talk. Let's do a little housekeeping

24:33.100 --> 24:37.580
Remember we're live every Tuesday although I'll be traveling like I mentioned earlier to Austin

24:37.580 --> 24:42.140
So I there will be some time in there where we are not live, but we'll still have a show for you

24:42.140 --> 24:48.380
In fact, there's a website you can use to find out more. That's right Jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar

24:48.380 --> 24:51.260
Where they'll be robots to convert it in your local time

24:51.260 --> 24:56.900
How about that robots Wes and we didn't make them do what we asked and they said they'd be happy to because they are far

24:56.900 --> 25:04.260
Superior to our limited human minds. Yeah, they've got plenty of time. So they figured why not what else we gonna do and

25:04.860 --> 25:08.380
Little pay it for going on over at a cloud guru. They're giving away

25:08.940 --> 25:13.080
1000 subscriptions, how about that link to that in the show notes go check that out

25:13.080 --> 25:20.000
You can find out more information and I believe it's running until June. So for the end of June

25:20.000 --> 25:25.640
Anyways, details are over there. They're awarding an annual subscription to those applying they'll receive a free ACG subscription

25:26.120 --> 25:33.400
That's pretty awesome. What a great opportunity to skill up and link in the show notes to pay it forward at linux unplug.com slash

25:34.640 --> 25:38.480
355 also a mention for the love plug happens every Sunday

25:38.480 --> 25:45.400
Same bat time at noon Pacific just a different bat day. There's a chat room to on geek shed at IRC geekshed.net

25:45.920 --> 25:47.920
pound love plug and

25:48.320 --> 25:52.320
You can jump in there. We do it every Sunday, and that's when I decided

25:53.360 --> 25:57.400
Well, I was gonna convert my cousin systems butter fest and I'd start with my own before I did his

25:58.120 --> 26:03.720
Now I'm not so sure he'll be down for it, but stay tuned in the love plug for more and that my friends is the housekeeping

26:03.720 --> 26:10.280
So as we had a discussion recently about different network troubleshooting techniques that we had been both recently employing

26:10.840 --> 26:15.440
You've actually had opportunity to go through and fix up the home network and we thought well

26:15.760 --> 26:22.760
What a great opportunity to share our recent experiences here on the show and this is one of those times

26:22.960 --> 26:24.960
Where we get to go with Wes

26:25.640 --> 26:28.240
Into his home on a weekend. I

26:28.240 --> 26:34.400
Imagine it's a rainy evening in Seattle. Am I right? Of course, it is. Yeah, it's just been raining. You've all seen tracer

26:35.440 --> 26:39.680
It's pretty much true. It has been a rainy weekend and Wes discovers

26:40.240 --> 26:43.920
Something strange. I think we've all been there. There's something strange

26:44.520 --> 26:46.520
on my network an

26:47.000 --> 26:49.080
Unknown device, you know, yes

26:49.080 --> 26:54.480
We all have these projects that seem to crop up when you're trying to do something else. You're going about your day

26:54.480 --> 27:00.600
And then you notice something's not quite right. I didn't ask for this really this all started over the weekend

27:00.600 --> 27:03.720
But I noticed I was having some internet problems. I

27:04.560 --> 27:08.840
Was trying to download a new steam game to well let off some steam with some friends

27:08.840 --> 27:13.720
And I was pretty embarrassed when I found I was only getting about two mags down

27:14.360 --> 27:17.240
Now sadly, I'm not on fiber at my current place

27:17.240 --> 27:22.760
But I do have a pretty decent Comcast business connection that I can use to get to my network

27:22.760 --> 27:26.920
But I do have a pretty decent Comcast business connection that reliably performs well above that

27:27.680 --> 27:33.160
Now I should be the first to admit that my network. Well, it's not in the most pristine state

27:33.160 --> 27:40.000
It's ever been I move more than I'd like and unfortunately that means things sometimes get messy

27:40.200 --> 27:45.200
I'm well overdue for some firmware updates. I handed some password rotations

27:45.720 --> 27:49.000
Since I was already over there and giving the modem a reboot. I thought

27:49.000 --> 27:55.440
Well, I won't be playing this game anytime soon. I think it's time for a home network checkup

27:55.440 --> 28:00.720
So he's a little embarrassing when you get all set with friends and then technical issues

28:00.720 --> 28:08.080
Yeah, right like come on. I'm supposed to be a computer person and I can't make this work. Yep, and tip one in Wes's quest is

28:08.880 --> 28:14.160
Check your logs. You may be surprised by what you find as I sat there doing the usual updates. I

28:15.080 --> 28:17.720
Decided well, let's take a look at the log files

28:17.720 --> 28:22.000
That's when I started noticing something wasn't right

28:23.000 --> 28:28.080
They're right in the DHCP leases was a device. I didn't recognize

28:28.840 --> 28:32.280
Now as I said, my network is messy and there's plenty of random

28:32.760 --> 28:37.000
IOT gadgets wireless devices and just general computers plugged in

28:37.720 --> 28:39.120
but this

28:39.120 --> 28:43.120
Well, this was really unknown. And of course, there's only one solution

28:43.120 --> 28:49.200
It's time to break out the networking tools perhaps the king of the networking tools to get a better sense of things

28:49.360 --> 28:52.280
And really because at this point and I was just a little nervous

28:52.280 --> 28:57.160
I thought I'd fire up nmap and take a look at what responded on my network

28:57.880 --> 29:02.020
And yep, there was the same anomalous MAC address

29:03.280 --> 29:09.600
Nmap didn't know what it was and plugging that MAC address in online. No results there either

29:09.600 --> 29:15.160
10 dot 1 dot 10 dot 2 1 2. What are you and

29:16.240 --> 29:17.400
Where?

29:17.400 --> 29:21.840
Your mind must have been racing at this point. Yeah, I mean come on. This is my home network

29:21.840 --> 29:27.740
I've got VPN set up to several the key secure or supposedly secure locations. I can't have that

29:27.760 --> 29:32.480
Did you go through like various ideas on what are my options on how to track this thing down now?

29:32.480 --> 29:35.400
Yeah, you know, I was kind of just thinking like well, what can I find out about it?

29:35.400 --> 29:39.600
what do I have that I can sort of eliminate from the list, but I was

29:39.960 --> 29:45.560
Roving around my house looking at devices thinking like okay. Is there anything else I can unplug to try to discover if that's it

29:46.160 --> 29:50.040
But no if you're in a situation now where maybe you're working from home

29:50.040 --> 29:53.720
I've noticed this with a lot of the meetings that I've been in people that are working from home

29:54.240 --> 29:57.840
Now all of a sudden they're a lot more reliant on that home network than they were before

29:57.880 --> 30:00.600
And so you also wonder about the security of it

30:00.600 --> 30:07.240
So these kinds of things really kind of can kind of nag at you. So I like I like the Westpain drastic action approach

30:07.640 --> 30:10.800
Then map revealed the port 9080 was open

30:10.920 --> 30:15.640
But unfortunately, it didn't respond to HTTP requests or anything over TCP

30:16.200 --> 30:20.300
At this point I was getting desperate. I'd have to do something dramatic

30:21.320 --> 30:22.920
It was time

30:22.920 --> 30:24.920
to change my Wi-Fi

30:24.960 --> 30:26.960
ssid

30:27.080 --> 30:29.020
No going back

30:29.020 --> 30:34.680
Having to manually set up all my connected devices again. It's the real scorched-earth approach there Wes

30:34.720 --> 30:40.040
Yeah, right burn it all down. We'll start fresh and only the things I want will be at it

30:40.040 --> 30:44.880
That's definitely a way to just guarantee that it's a it's a clean setup

30:45.880 --> 30:49.160
Did you ever get a sense of what device it was after you did this?

30:49.160 --> 30:54.640
Did you go around and find that something wasn't working? Oh my gosh. Yes. Okay, so this is also pretty funny here

30:54.640 --> 31:01.560
I was frantically searching my house, you know for IOT devices rogue Google devices plugged in which let me just say

31:01.840 --> 31:08.200
So many ports open. I'm a little disturbed, but I never thought to check the thermostat sitting behind the fridge

31:08.200 --> 31:15.160
I mean, it's not plugged in I didn't plug it in. It's just a little wall ward, but of course it has Wi-Fi

31:16.440 --> 31:23.360
So useful obviously too, you know, I actually I am glad that it supports Wi-Fi and there's a home assistant module for it

31:23.360 --> 31:29.860
So honestly, that is something I will be playing with because well, I'm just curious even if I didn't need it over the winter

31:29.960 --> 31:35.360
Yeah, and now you can put it on the Wi-Fi when you're ready. That is the one nice thing about changing the SSID

31:35.720 --> 31:40.120
I've played around with like trying to do MAC address and matching it to a vendor

31:40.120 --> 31:47.040
But I agree with past West from the weekend. This is his bit of advice. Don't let this happen to you

31:47.120 --> 31:52.080
so there's a couple of tools and whatnot that I think could help in a situation like that a

31:52.080 --> 31:56.880
Tried and true one that I know our friends at the Ubuntu podcast also love is net discover

31:57.400 --> 32:01.160
Which is a really handy tool to take a look around your land and see what's going on

32:01.160 --> 32:05.780
Yeah, that makes it so easy and it's a handy sort of, you know, just a little end curses interface

32:05.780 --> 32:10.800
So it interactively keeps pinging out to your network and then updating with whatever it finds. I like that

32:10.800 --> 32:15.940
So that's a really good one to get a lay of the land also nmap. You heard West use that tool in there

32:16.280 --> 32:21.120
You could read a book on nmap there because there are several and it is totally worth it

32:21.120 --> 32:25.320
but a really simple command is pseudo nmap tack lowercase s

32:25.720 --> 32:31.200
uppercase s and then your IP space slash 24 or whatever your subnet is and

32:31.560 --> 32:36.360
Just let it go to town and discover all the devices and talk to them and a lot of times it can tell you the operating

32:36.360 --> 32:39.700
System and whatnot so that can help you get your arms around what's going on. I

32:40.240 --> 32:45.680
Want to mention if you have Android you owe it to yourself to get Wi-Fi analyzer

32:45.680 --> 32:51.080
It's such a great tool and you can look to see if there's maybe a channel that isn't quite as busy in your neck of

32:51.080 --> 32:56.720
The woods and move your Wi-Fi network over to that if it's not doing that automatically and that may improve your signal

32:56.960 --> 33:03.780
So that's something to consider. There's just maybe basics like that to help improve just Wi-Fi with something like Wi-Fi analyzer

33:03.780 --> 33:05.480
Which is on f-droid?

33:05.480 --> 33:12.120
Then on your Linux laptop take a look at wavemon and then cursors based monitoring applications for wireless devices and your network

33:12.120 --> 33:18.440
Which is really useful and again another beautiful and curses interface. That's right. We love that end curses up in here

33:18.440 --> 33:25.160
I use a W LAN scanner and that one also gives a nice overview of your

33:25.560 --> 33:28.480
2.4 and 5 gigahertz on your Android

33:28.480 --> 33:31.840
I'll also give a recommendation to a tool that Weston I'd love

33:32.160 --> 33:36.840
West may be a little more than I net data which is useful for a lot of reasons

33:36.840 --> 33:44.240
But one of the neat things that net data will do is it will generate errors and alerts if there's something funky going on

33:44.440 --> 33:46.760
Packet-wise on your network. I actually had this happen

33:46.760 --> 33:50.320
Ah, maybe a year or so ago when we first started playing with net data

33:50.320 --> 33:53.360
It was really early into it cuz I didn't even really understand what it was telling me at first

33:53.360 --> 33:58.040
It's just spewing errors and information about how broken your setup is. Yeah, and then I realized oh

33:58.160 --> 34:03.440
It's telling me that there's a whole crap ton of discarded UDP packets on my network

34:03.440 --> 34:10.800
That is way beyond the normal in a one-minute period and that began a journey of troubleshooting that eventually improved

34:10.800 --> 34:18.520
The Wi-Fi network. Thanks so much Vizio. So tools like that even that aren't necessarily for network troubleshooting can help surface interesting information

34:18.720 --> 34:20.720
Boy, that's the story for another time

34:21.600 --> 34:26.440
I think what we're trying to advocate though if we just it could extract away from the individual tools

34:27.000 --> 34:28.720
trying to advocate

34:28.720 --> 34:33.360
being aware of what is on your network and how much resources is consuming and

34:33.880 --> 34:36.640
What that might be from a security posture standpoint?

34:36.640 --> 34:42.080
And I think what we're kind of suggesting you might consider doing is do it West did and just say hey

34:42.080 --> 34:49.000
let's let's do a network checkup and let's go through and check the firmware versions on the Wi-Fi or on the router or on this

34:49.000 --> 34:54.920
IOT device and maybe it means you got to go recover a password so that way you can log into the we things portal or

34:54.920 --> 34:58.280
Whatever the hell they need you to do so that way you can manage your light switch, but do it

34:58.280 --> 35:04.280
you know get those updates done or or maybe take a weekend and see if you can throw a few of those things in home assistant instead and

35:04.280 --> 35:07.240
maybe reduce some of the internet traffic and

35:08.480 --> 35:10.480
Improve your Wi-Fi that way, too

35:10.680 --> 35:18.040
Now as you dug out a few tips from Jim Salter over on ours technica on some simple ideas for reliable Wi-Fi

35:18.120 --> 35:22.360
Yeah, I mean at the end of the day you've got to remember that Wi-Fi is it's a shared spectrum

35:22.360 --> 35:28.800
So your performance is often the same or limited by the worst performing device on your network

35:28.800 --> 35:34.120
So if you've got one AP sitting somewhere and you've got someone trying to stream YouTube across the house

35:34.480 --> 35:41.120
That's gonna be a lot of retries and those are competing for your latency sensitive packets in your zoom call

35:41.120 --> 35:46.960
so you've got to start thinking about things like where are your APs placed and when are you using it the most and

35:47.400 --> 35:50.800
Who else is on your network? And what are they doing, right?

35:50.800 --> 35:58.320
Also things like the layout of your house no more than two rooms and two walls is a pretty good rule of thumb

35:59.320 --> 36:06.800
Also, don't necessarily get too hung up on transmit power too much transmit power can be a bug as a Jim says it and

36:07.120 --> 36:13.600
Make sure you're really taking placement into advisement as much as possible. He suggests above your head height is

36:14.560 --> 36:17.760
Actually the most preferable location, which I got to admit

36:17.760 --> 36:25.080
most of my APs are down near like foot and leg level maybe knee level at best for a couple of them knee level what

36:25.080 --> 36:30.600
Devices do you even have down there extenders that are plugged into outlets? Oh you although I will say, you know

36:31.600 --> 36:36.800
Mesh I think gets maybe a bad name in in our circles here on Linux unplugged

36:36.800 --> 36:44.540
but it can legitimately be useful especially in an environment where you don't want to run a bunch of Ethernet although I will say

36:44.540 --> 36:49.940
If you can have a cabled connection, well, that's just gonna help everything. Okay now

36:50.900 --> 36:56.140
Let's talk about the router. This is one where I think all of us have a lot of thoughts and

36:56.700 --> 36:59.100
Wes and I are constantly debating

37:00.220 --> 37:03.340
appliance versus hardware device versus

37:04.100 --> 37:09.100
Build it yourself Linux box. Yeah. Well, it's a tough question because different people have different needs

37:09.100 --> 37:15.380
How much time do you want to spend babysitting it or having to migrate from backups like you've just experienced Chris?

37:15.500 --> 37:17.060
but at the same time

37:17.060 --> 37:21.980
Do you want to be familiar with how your network works and do you want to know the ins and outs and thankfully?

37:21.980 --> 37:26.420
There's a whole bunch of solutions that range from something like open sense or PF sense

37:26.580 --> 37:34.060
All the way down to just running an IP tables commands yourself, although I'd probably recommend firehole over doing that. Hmm

37:34.060 --> 37:36.740
Okay. Well, let's take inventory here in a moment. See what everybody's using

37:36.740 --> 37:42.420
I had this thought when all of this went down if I had some sort of QoS or

37:42.660 --> 37:49.340
Something that was throttling all of the other devices and maybe I had priority like my my IP or whatever

37:49.620 --> 37:54.060
Maybe I wouldn't have had this issue to begin with maybe I wouldn't have needed to switch Wi-Fi networks

37:54.060 --> 37:57.340
And I wouldn't have disconnected that terminal session and lost the data

37:57.460 --> 38:01.700
Yeah, you know that's a good question and a little bit of quality of service can go a long way

38:02.140 --> 38:05.360
Obviously it can't repair problems that you're gonna have upstream, right?

38:05.360 --> 38:09.500
I mean if you're just hitting a limit with what you can send or receive from your provider

38:09.820 --> 38:14.820
Well, you're kind of stuck but for optimizing what goes in and out of your home network

38:15.180 --> 38:19.140
Yeah, those tools can be really handy, especially if you're an environment where all right

38:19.140 --> 38:20.980
Well, the kids are there streaming a movie

38:20.980 --> 38:26.420
It's okay if they buffer a little bit, but I'd really not like to lose my connection to this conference call

38:26.420 --> 38:28.700
That's pretty important. Yeah, exactly

38:29.300 --> 38:32.380
All right. So just around the horn I've recently talked about mine

38:32.380 --> 38:37.500
So I don't need to go into it too much, but I'm using that GE slate mobile router still love it

38:37.500 --> 38:43.960
I think it's a great little device probably will replace it someday, but I haven't decided what yet. What about you Wes?

38:43.960 --> 38:48.940
Are you replacing your router? Do you have a new one? What's what's that area of your network like right now?

38:48.940 --> 38:56.260
You know, I was just thinking those might make a great little sort of just standalone guest or alternative network Wi-Fi

38:56.260 --> 38:59.860
Where you're not too concerned about performance, but you just want to connect it up with your you know

38:59.860 --> 39:06.020
Whatever whatever you've got upstream and then share it out, especially if maybe whatever you're using for Wi-Fi doesn't support multiple networks

39:06.140 --> 39:07.300
If it does, you know

39:07.300 --> 39:13.340
You've probably got ways to define more than one Wi-Fi network or set up a guest network and those can be useful, too

39:13.820 --> 39:20.020
For me. Well, I'm just still using firehole because it's a great balance of configurability and programmability

39:20.380 --> 39:24.940
but not having to dive into all the complicated mess of IP tables and

39:24.940 --> 39:33.180
The intricate commands to really do a good job of being secure a deny first policy and making sure that you optimize things for performance

39:33.180 --> 39:40.500
What would make that even better though is if it was on a low power low heat kind of quiet or even totally silent device

39:40.540 --> 39:44.340
Yeah, that's true. I am using a not super powerful

39:44.340 --> 39:52.300
But not arm level Celeron chip at the moment which meets my performance needs but does have a big old x86 style case

39:52.300 --> 39:56.620
Well, let's ask drew and cheese. See what see what they're using cheesy

39:56.620 --> 40:00.900
Do you have any particular router or firewall that you've put in or you got the ISP box?

40:00.900 --> 40:05.940
I have a Netgear Nighthawk router that's been flashed with DD WRT

40:06.380 --> 40:09.380
You know when talking about auditing your own network

40:09.700 --> 40:14.620
One thing that a lot of consumer routers do by default is they turn on WPS

40:15.100 --> 40:17.100
by default, which is something you should definitely

40:18.020 --> 40:19.900
disable because

40:19.900 --> 40:27.340
You could possibly have your network breached using WPS. And if you're still using web, there's something wrong with you. So

40:28.180 --> 40:33.000
All right, drew. What about you? What are you rocking for your home router? Well for my router

40:33.000 --> 40:37.900
I am running an edge router light the ER light 3

40:38.100 --> 40:42.420
It's a few years old now at this point actually, I think like five or six

40:42.420 --> 40:46.500
but it's still rocking great still getting support and

40:47.180 --> 40:49.180
firmware updates and

40:49.180 --> 40:51.020
it's

40:51.020 --> 40:55.180
surprisingly versatile for essentially what is a Debian based router and

40:55.580 --> 41:00.060
Then I've got the unify access points and a couple of different spots in my house

41:00.060 --> 41:04.140
I am very impressed that you're sitting around five plus years now with this device

41:04.140 --> 41:06.300
I mean, I think that's the stamp of success right there

41:06.300 --> 41:12.460
I wonder how Bruce feels about this because Bruce you've been rolling a traditional Linux firewall since

41:12.460 --> 41:18.820
1995 yeah, I was the year I graduated high school and one of my friends had gotten me into Linux and I set up a

41:19.220 --> 41:26.100
Free BSD run-of-the-mill bare OS firewall just to do basket rating way back when and I've evolved since then and right now

41:26.100 --> 41:27.820
I'm running PFSense. Okay

41:27.820 --> 41:33.340
So what did you like about running a full Linux box as a firewall and why did you switch to PFSense?

41:33.340 --> 41:39.180
So two questions there really well originally I just didn't like any of the existing, you know

41:39.180 --> 41:42.700
Firewall things that you would get from an ISP provider or something like that

41:42.700 --> 41:44.980
I wanted something I have control of all that kind of stuff

41:44.980 --> 41:50.500
So the normal kind of ideas from you know, our kind of target audience, I guess and switching to PFSense

41:50.660 --> 41:54.860
It was more just you know, generally not having to do IP tables and all that kind of stuff

41:55.260 --> 41:55.860
You know

41:55.860 --> 41:58.300
I have a point-to-point connection for VPN for work

41:58.820 --> 42:03.420
Having all the graphing tools and stuff that it has although I'm seeing in the chat that open sense

42:03.740 --> 42:05.740
Sounds pretty good. So I might be checking that out

42:05.740 --> 42:10.280
Haha, yes, the call of open sense. I've heard that song as well

42:10.420 --> 42:14.820
Well, that's interesting and I I think I kind of align with your thinking

42:15.020 --> 42:17.640
We'll have some links in the show notes to fire hole

42:17.660 --> 42:22.860
Of course other things that you're familiar with you can you can probably send us in a few ideas as well

42:22.860 --> 42:25.780
Because there's probably more that we're missing at Linux unplug comm slash

42:26.180 --> 42:32.180
Contact I'll do something soon. I'll do something I think for me key things. I want are

42:32.180 --> 42:38.460
reliability wire guard at the edge the only place I'd like a gooey to really is just

42:39.180 --> 42:41.500
for setting up simple DNS entries and

42:42.580 --> 42:47.600
Maybe static DHCP mappings. That's what I really like about the piehole UI right now

42:47.600 --> 42:52.140
Is it gives me that kind of stuff now, you know, piehole does a pretty good job and it's you know

42:52.140 --> 42:54.540
It's built on top of their own fork of DNS mask

42:54.540 --> 43:01.340
So if you're already familiar with using that which is super handy, especially for doing like split horizon DNS setups

43:01.340 --> 43:03.340
Or just any sort of DNS customization

43:03.500 --> 43:08.660
Well, you can do all that same stuff on piehole either through the gooey or if you want on the command line

43:08.660 --> 43:10.960
They're a couple other things before we get off Wi-Fi

43:11.780 --> 43:16.920
Consider at least two or three Wi-Fi networks West you kind of touched on this

43:16.920 --> 43:21.740
But maybe consider a kids network and IOT network and a guest network

43:21.740 --> 43:28.660
And then of course the main production network where your your device is and maybe your spouse or whatever your significant others devices

43:28.660 --> 43:34.060
Whoever might be family. I have not done the separate kids network, but after this experience recently

43:34.060 --> 43:37.320
I'm considering it for the QoS X aspect of it

43:37.340 --> 43:42.140
But I have done the guest and IOT network and I like that a lot. So for me

43:42.140 --> 43:47.420
I put all those people on two four and it's a separate SSID with a separate password

43:48.020 --> 43:50.020
It's a separate IP space nice

43:50.060 --> 43:56.580
The IOT network can't talk to the guest network the guest network can't see any of my automation devices or any of my IOT devices

43:56.580 --> 43:59.060
They just get a route out to the internet and that's it

43:59.060 --> 44:05.700
And then I have a production SSID that I connect to that is the LAN that has all the devices that can talk to each

44:05.700 --> 44:11.460
Other and I like that a lot. I think it it's a little additional complexity up front

44:11.540 --> 44:16.220
But if you just do it in a really clear simple way, it's pretty easy to maintain and easy to explain

44:16.820 --> 44:20.900
Alright, so West Payne's hot VPN tips hot VPN tips, you know

44:20.900 --> 44:24.780
One thing I like doing for myself is if you have access to it at the router

44:24.780 --> 44:29.980
You can set some of those things up so that if you've got multiple devices you need to use on the VPN

44:30.340 --> 44:35.260
Well, you can set it up that way right just make sure that you only allow access to the VPN connection

44:35.260 --> 44:41.460
Which you've established on your router from those particular devices and you don't have to fiddle with clients on each of those things

44:42.060 --> 44:44.620
Configuring all of that now this could be a security risk

44:44.620 --> 44:46.860
So make sure you've got your firewall configured correctly

44:46.980 --> 44:52.660
But it can make things pretty nice and simplify a config where you might want to do something like a split horizon

44:52.660 --> 44:59.780
DNS setup where instead of forwarding all your VPN traffic over to work and having everything resolved out that way

45:00.220 --> 45:03.020
Well, just send things that you need over that network

45:03.020 --> 45:06.900
And if you use something like DNS mask or many other solutions

45:07.020 --> 45:13.820
You can have it so that DNS queries that are meant to be resolved on the VPN network go that way and everything else

45:13.820 --> 45:19.260
Just uses your standard resolver that makes for a very slick setup where you don't have to worry that

45:19.260 --> 45:24.900
Everything you do is going through the works network or just you know getting that delay some VPNs

45:24.900 --> 45:32.460
Also, you know, you can you can specifically say just this IP block and only traffic to this very particular IP block goes over the VPN

45:33.260 --> 45:38.260
Not true for all of them though. I think the first couple of times I ever really had a work VPN

45:38.380 --> 45:40.940
It was one of those where there's a client piece

45:40.940 --> 45:45.560
They'd have to install or one of these web things that have to go through like an ActiveX connection

45:45.560 --> 45:49.360
It was the worst and it would just by default do all the traffic

45:49.360 --> 45:53.480
It was just the worst it was always for doctors offices, too. If you are running a VPN

45:54.040 --> 45:57.220
Locally just watch out for IP v6

45:57.720 --> 46:04.640
Sometimes you'll get an IP v6 address, which is just totally fine on its own, but you'll have an IP v4 only tunnel configuration

46:04.640 --> 46:07.120
So you'll think all your traffic is going over the tunnel

46:07.120 --> 46:14.140
But in fact IP v6 is still going through your local gateway now a big plug again for the self-hosted podcast

46:14.140 --> 46:20.900
this is table stakes for that show amongst many other things including running a bunch of services on your LAN and

46:21.740 --> 46:26.420
I talk a little bit about more of my server setup in there. You mean just how many pies you have?

46:27.140 --> 46:30.340
Yes, and I think you'd probably really enjoy it if any of this appeals to you

46:30.340 --> 46:36.320
So check that out at self hosted dot show, but let's let's do a little feedback. You ready Wes lay it on me

46:38.020 --> 46:40.020
Michael writes in he says I wanted to thank you guys

46:40.020 --> 46:46.940
I've been primarily listening to other Linux broadcasts in the end in their telegram groups, but I switched to your telegram group in the last two days

46:48.340 --> 46:52.020
Controversy, what could it be? And this is why we're reading this because

46:52.740 --> 46:58.220
Since our last episode there has been quite a bit of feedback around our discussion regarding Microsoft

46:59.460 --> 47:01.340
and

47:01.340 --> 47:02.180
Michael writes here

47:02.180 --> 47:08.040
It seems that the closer we get to WSL to being released and the more software Microsoft open sources

47:08.040 --> 47:11.920
The more hatred against Microsoft. I saw in other Linux groups

47:12.600 --> 47:17.400
Ironically, it made me feel alienated and pushed me towards trying out Windows 10

47:19.400 --> 47:24.960
You know, I can kind of understand that when like when group thing starts to set in I sometimes have like this rebellious

47:25.720 --> 47:29.420
Nerve that just gets pushed on and then I go I rebel against it

47:29.420 --> 47:33.620
but this is something that I said what happened in the post show last week and

47:33.620 --> 47:41.400
It definitely bared out like I got a lot of people who are not happy about the way we talk about Microsoft

47:41.400 --> 47:42.880
There has even been

47:42.880 --> 47:44.560
clickbait blog

47:44.560 --> 47:50.760
Articles that have been written attacking JB and me for talking about it. I mean, it's pretty intense and

47:51.360 --> 47:55.440
You'll hear so much rhetoric about how this is the worst thing Microsoft has ever done

47:55.440 --> 48:01.720
This is embrace extend and extinguish taken to the next level and it seems to be yet another divide

48:01.720 --> 48:06.920
that is developing in our community and that makes me very sad because I

48:07.440 --> 48:10.060
Think every situation with every company

48:10.640 --> 48:13.400
should be taken on its own individual merits and

48:13.960 --> 48:21.600
Any commercial company from Red Hat to Microsoft that is participating in this space has to be monitored with a certain level of suspicion

48:22.920 --> 48:25.440
Although maybe that's a little extreme, you know

48:25.440 --> 48:32.080
But you have to be aware and paying attention a recognition that they've got their own motives and their you know their own drives

48:32.080 --> 48:32.960
And that's okay

48:32.960 --> 48:40.240
That's part of the design of the whole open source ecosystem is that we all have those but we can agree that some things are better

48:40.240 --> 48:46.040
Done shared and this truth is applicable to any company whose goal is to earn revenue

48:46.600 --> 48:50.400
We kind of individually apply it in the Linux community

48:50.400 --> 48:58.320
There's some groups and companies that get a blank check and really nothing is questioned. And then there's some who

48:59.160 --> 49:02.960
Probably because of past actions. There's just a relentless suspicion now

49:03.680 --> 49:06.760
That of course eventually had to result in

49:07.360 --> 49:10.640
unfortunately division I'm trying to consider how we can

49:11.440 --> 49:13.280
accurately and

49:13.280 --> 49:14.280
level-headedly

49:14.280 --> 49:16.280
cover this stuff without

49:16.280 --> 49:23.000
Exaggerating that situation and causing more division and that's something I've been chewing on that I don't have a

49:23.600 --> 49:27.800
Great answer for Michael continues. He says I've been using Linux since 1997

49:27.800 --> 49:34.500
But when a community becomes all about hatred of something rather than the love of Linux then you push people away even your own community

49:34.500 --> 49:38.740
I'm so glad that you guys have managed to create a healthy community that does not fall into that trap

49:38.740 --> 49:43.460
I mean, I think we're struggling with it too. I wouldn't give us too much credit. We're struggling with it

49:43.460 --> 49:48.160
Yeah, absolutely, and I don't know quite what the right answer is here

49:48.760 --> 49:50.200
some of it

49:50.200 --> 49:55.200
Feels like reasonable suspicion and some of it feels silly

49:55.760 --> 50:02.500
The one that feels sort of silly to me is the embrace and extend an extinguished discussion that has cropped up around

50:02.960 --> 50:04.600
Maui and

50:04.600 --> 50:10.100
Around DirectX being available on the Windows subsystem for Linux. I think the premise is flawed

50:10.100 --> 50:14.340
There's no embrace an extending of something that's never been a success

50:14.340 --> 50:20.300
The Linux desktop is not a success that threatens Microsoft. In fact, it's entirely possible that

50:21.540 --> 50:28.360
The quote-unquote vast success of the Linux desktop is barely even represented on any Microsoft

50:28.580 --> 50:32.120
Market share chart now the server sure mobile. Absolutely

50:32.860 --> 50:37.220
IOT yeah a desktop. I think people need a bit of a reality check

50:37.220 --> 50:45.040
Microsoft is not embracing and extending the Linux desktop with adding DirectX api's to WSL to only on Windows

50:45.440 --> 50:47.440
The entire premise is silly

50:47.440 --> 50:53.600
But yet that doesn't prevent YouTube videos and blogs and people going on Twitter

50:54.340 --> 50:58.480
Going on and on about how this is obviously Microsoft trying to extinguish Linux

50:58.480 --> 51:06.480
It's a silly premise to begin with there is no threat from the Linux desktop. I'm sorry. I love it, too

51:06.880 --> 51:13.540
But it is probably not even statistically measurable by Microsoft on the Windows market share bottom line. Let's be honest

51:14.080 --> 51:16.080
The Mac it's good. Yeah, it gets a few percent

51:16.800 --> 51:18.400
Chromebooks. Yeah, that sucks

51:18.400 --> 51:22.160
Not Linux desktop. We're too busy fighting amongst each other

51:22.160 --> 51:29.520
and they were the last thing they're worried about and WSL is absolutely more about taking on the Mac as a

51:29.680 --> 51:37.040
Development platform than it is about Linux desktop, but people are so trapped in this bubble. They can't see it

51:37.040 --> 51:42.960
They don't see the bigger picture. It's not some grand conspiracy to keep the Linux desktop down. It was never up

51:42.960 --> 51:44.960
I'm sorry. I love it, too

51:45.040 --> 51:47.920
But it never got up and it's going to be fine

51:47.920 --> 51:53.440
This will just result in more Linux users and it's not going to stop the plasma or gnome shell developers

51:53.840 --> 51:58.880
Certainly not and I mean if anything it's aimed at the success of Linux on the server, right?

51:58.880 --> 52:02.800
It's a recognition that people are using Linux not on the desktop

52:02.800 --> 52:09.760
But to deploy their production workloads and that's the world Microsoft wants to cater to yeah, and this isn't a defense of Microsoft

52:10.400 --> 52:12.400
I think this is a defense of

52:12.880 --> 52:14.640
rational thinking

52:14.640 --> 52:18.960
And taking each individual situation on its own merits and evaluating it

52:19.600 --> 52:21.600
That's all I'm advocating for

52:21.760 --> 52:23.840
And I I just I plea

52:24.960 --> 52:28.080
for this not to become a divisive issue in the community it would just

52:29.360 --> 52:33.520
There's so many of them. It would just be so nice to have something that doesn't develop into this

52:34.000 --> 52:36.960
We've got enough and a good time to practice acknowledging that

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
I mean Microsoft has is built up of a

52:40.000 --> 52:45.280
Bunch of people and they've all got their own opinions about open source and there is there is a company line

52:45.280 --> 52:50.240
But I think we've seen how much that has changed even with you know, their president admitting as much

52:51.040 --> 52:53.600
So it's a flexible universe and they are a company

52:53.680 --> 53:00.480
But it's they're made up of people who have different opinions about open source than maybe once they did. What are you?

53:00.720 --> 53:04.240
Yeah, we don't know though, right that it's hard to evaluate how a company change

53:05.040 --> 53:07.040
And over time. Yeah

53:07.120 --> 53:09.120
That is part of it. Here's my pitch

53:09.120 --> 53:12.640
Screw Microsoft. Who cares what Microsoft thinks or feels like?

53:12.720 --> 53:16.240
I don't think that you have to be part of the consideration for the Linux community

53:16.480 --> 53:18.800
It's probably good to do that. But roll with this for a second

53:19.600 --> 53:26.320
Forget Microsoft forget what they're trying forget if they're open or forget any of it what the strategy is. Forget all of it

53:26.800 --> 53:28.480
Here's the truth

53:28.480 --> 53:31.920
They're going to be more people using Linux coming into our community

53:32.400 --> 53:38.560
looking to connect with other individuals either for help for inspiration for guidance for mentorship and we should

53:38.560 --> 53:45.120
Really try not to blow this we shouldn't let our prejudice and our feelings towards Microsoft, whatever they may be

53:45.840 --> 53:47.840
We shouldn't take that out on these new users

53:48.240 --> 53:53.680
We need to be welcoming to new people when they come into this community and show them that it's a collaborative space the true

53:54.640 --> 53:56.160
True open source nature is here

53:56.160 --> 54:01.520
Like you found something that is compelling that maybe draws you in that makes you want to go even further

54:02.080 --> 54:04.080
And if we're just so close to blowing it

54:04.080 --> 54:09.360
I think you've seen that with canonical support for Ubuntu on WSL right there. I mean they recognize it as a supported

54:09.840 --> 54:14.800
Platform for their operating system to run on so we should do the same if people are coming in with you know

54:15.280 --> 54:18.160
Questions about things we can't just disqualify them

54:18.160 --> 54:24.080
Yes, there might be some caveats, but we shouldn't just outright disqualify them just because they happen to be running Linux on Windows

54:24.640 --> 54:27.520
All right. Well, I never meant to talk about this this long. Michael just got us talking

54:27.520 --> 54:34.400
That's what one of the great things about feedback. So my final thoughts on this are and I apologize this turned into such a soapbox. I

54:34.880 --> 54:40.320
Would ask you to see if this all comes from a place of insecurity about Linux's future on the desktop

54:41.120 --> 54:44.640
About the desktop in general about what it has still yet to get to

54:45.600 --> 54:48.080
And if maybe that isn't influencing your reaction

54:48.880 --> 54:52.100
wrapped up in moral superiority or technical advocacy

54:52.880 --> 54:54.880
But the reality the nut of it

54:54.880 --> 54:59.440
Might be insecurity. I know that's a harsh thing to say and a harsh thing to consider about yourself

54:59.440 --> 55:03.600
But I mean people come after me they write articles about me about this stuff

55:04.000 --> 55:09.920
And I think it has to come from someplace deep that is afraid of where this is going and I think that insecurity

55:10.560 --> 55:12.560
while understandable

55:12.560 --> 55:14.160
is misplaced

55:14.160 --> 55:20.480
Windows is still Windows and you can try to run it if you're if you've been a longtime Linux or Mac user

55:20.480 --> 55:24.880
You're still not going to find Windows satisfying. It's not going to destroy the Linux desktop. And I

55:25.600 --> 55:29.200
I would encourage us to maybe consider what's driving this defensiveness

55:30.000 --> 55:35.520
And try not to think about it from what's best for Microsoft or best for Linux or what canonical is doing and try to think

55:35.520 --> 55:40.640
About it from here come the users. How can we make them successful? How can we welcome them to the community?

55:40.640 --> 55:45.360
Yeah, really our goal is to convince them that Linux is a useful technology. They should be excited about learning

55:45.360 --> 55:52.160
Yeah, and there's a community behind it that makes it kind of fun and and maybe something that the windows and commercial platforms

55:52.160 --> 55:55.120
Don't really have in fact, I'd say they're kind of envious of

55:55.920 --> 55:57.920
Come on over the water's fine

55:58.480 --> 56:02.480
Most of the time in the right areas, maybe don't use butter fs

56:03.280 --> 56:04.960
It's too soon less

56:04.960 --> 56:06.400
It's too soon

56:06.400 --> 56:09.360
All right. Well, that is it for this week's episode of the unplug program

56:09.360 --> 56:13.200
We'd love to have you live next week because probably the week after that I'm going to be on the road

56:13.200 --> 56:16.320
So if you want to make it to a live show, it's going to be one of your last chances Tuesday

56:16.880 --> 56:18.880
At noon pacific jupyterbroadcasting.com

56:19.840 --> 56:24.240
Slash calendar to get that converted in your time. Don't forget about the love plug on sunday coming up

56:24.800 --> 56:28.180
We'd love to have you there and links to everything we talked about at linuxunplug.com

56:28.180 --> 56:42.280
Slash 355 the show is at linuxunplugged on twitter at jupyter signal for the network. We'll see you back here next tuesday

56:58.420 --> 57:00.420
So

57:16.980 --> 57:21.140
No computer kid just no live shows while i'm driving to and from texas

57:21.780 --> 57:27.540
No, you we're gonna miss it twice. You said we would never miss anymore. Oh, don't worry

57:27.540 --> 57:32.660
It'll be like we were never gone for the download audience. I'm not the download audience. Well, you will be
