1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,520
Wes's adventures with IP tables. What happened? Oh, no, I just I just had a machine running some old monitoring software

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,520
I need to just it's just terrible. I'd love to kill it, but it's the thing receiving SNMP traps right now

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,200
But it doesn't use I mean like wraps net SNMP, but it doesn't use SNMP trap T

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,320
So it wasn't that I couldn't just have it stop listening or I couldn't set up my own proxy without having to take it down

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,960
for some times, but I was able to use IP tables with the dash dash T, which I'd never used before and

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,760
Then that sense it sends it over to a secondary host which then does a

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,120
pre-routing rule on it to change the

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,200
Where it's addressed to which then sends it off to my actual house where I'm going to capture all these so I know

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,520
You know, hey, what's actually hitting this machine?

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,040
But I was really it was like two commands. It was really yeah, I didn't have to oh, I know it

11
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,520
No, that's Wes. You had me at IP tables

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is Linux unplugged episode

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,880
190 for March 28th

14
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,240
2017

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,680
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's converting file systems in real time. My name is Chris. My name is Wes

16
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,800
Hello, Wes. Keep your hands off my file system. Haha. I know I don't just there's actually a few file system things coming up today, but

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,080
First we're gonna get through some updates

18
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,360
There's a project that's been on the back of my mind for months that we haven't talked about

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,440
Saving it a big huge change up with free NAS this week

20
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,360
We're gonna talk about that kind of kind of fit in with some other topics that we have

21
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,280
Coming up down the road just some overall stuff really kind of like major changes for a few projects. We talked about then

22
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,920
I'm really looking forward to this. I'm very excited about this

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
towards the end of the show

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
We're gonna spend a little bit of Wes's money

25
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:03,200
Yeah, yeah, Wes Wes has entered that wallet at home. Haha, you know, we've all been there like I think it's time for a new laptop

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,520
Yeah, I gotta get a new computer and it this can be like a multi-month search

27
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,240
Sometimes it can be a couple of days search depending on your situation

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,060
And so this week Wes is on the search for the ultimate Linux machine

29
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,240
we're gonna find out what his requirements are and then our

30
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,920
Panel of Linux experts the virtual lug will chime in with their ideas on what might be a fitting machine

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,680
And there happens to be some new Linux hardware releases coming very soon that may fit

32
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,880
We'll talk about those we all of that to go through plus

33
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,840
kind of a

34
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,840
kind of an out there futurist kind of idea about how maybe we could

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,040
Sort of take Linux and mobile Linux to the next level and some really like taking some low-end machines and just giving them huge upgrades

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,280
So we'll talk about that in a little while too. So we got it

37
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,920
I'm got some good hardware stuff got some good file server stuff coming up

38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,560
Got some huge project changes that people need to know about like stuff. That's like relevant to all of our interests

39
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,600
I think it's gonna be I think it's gonna be a great show West

40
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,960
So let's get started by bringing in that virtual log. Hello time appropriate greetings virtual log

41
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,880
Hello, holy that was that was that was I wake you up that was a moment right there

42
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,320
So Wes if we're gonna talk about hardware that might work for you this week

43
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,760
We got to start with the zero terminal a tiny Linux PC that you can build using a Raspberry Pi and a smartphone keyboard

44
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,720
Look at how cute that is. It is super cute called the zero terminal

45
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:32,640
It's an all-in-one handheld computer that features a 3.5 inch screen and it gives you remarkable portability with a Raspberry Pi

46
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,240
Yeah, you got HDMI out. You can put a big old battery in there to run this thing

47
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,960
I don't have a tab key. That's what I want to do. Does it have an escape key? That's what you really want

48
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,760
Yeah, and it's got a video. That's always a win

49
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, you see that? Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's your massage. Yeah

50
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,920
This is the third iteration of the handheld Linux terminal project

51
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,360
I've been working on for a while now

52
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,960
Like the others the aim is to create a small all-in-one computer that is both portable and usable

53
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,160
One of the main problems with the last version was that it took way too long to make and some of the finishing

54
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,700
Wasn't as good as it could have been. I like this idea actually

55
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,060
Node plans to release the files for the 3d printed parts soon. So that's kind of neat but maybe

56
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,080
Maybe that's not really your style West. Maybe you want something more laptop style. So keep this in mind. I

57
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,040
Also saw this week. There is like a laptop like concept where you could snap something like that in

58
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,920
So you take a like a standard laptop?

59
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,280
Maybe in this case the Acer travel mate. Yeah, sure and you cut it open

60
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,480
and so you get it off eBay and you install a

61
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,840
Raspberry Pi into this thing and take advantage of its keyboard its screen you can use HDMI to drive the display

62
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,440
You can hook up keyboards and stuff like that and you put a Raspberry Pi inside a laptop

63
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,960
Okay, I'm just putting these out here as options. I know you're in the early that first one

64
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,880
That actually

65
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,280
Would be you like that because you can put it in the pocket. Yeah, you could put it in the pocket

66
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,460
I like that idea too. Okay, there's a few of these out there right now

67
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,840
There's one we covered on last recently too that's trying to build that in your pocket computer

68
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,120
That one was a more straight-up like we were gonna run Ubuntu and I don't I can't remember if it was arm or not

69
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:16,280
Yeah, a GPD pockets pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah, that's what it was. Do you remember William? Is that arm? It's just an atom

70
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,040
No, it's just like cheap low-end atoms like five watts or something. It's meant for like tablets and phones

71
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,360
Yeah, the GPD is atom and the Gemini is arm and these are all kicking around right now

72
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:34,840
They're both being crowdfunded at the moment. Yeah. Yeah, isn't that funny? Yeah, the GPD is like really funded like 2.5 million raised

73
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,620
Yeah, yeah. Yeah 1200 percent over their goal. Yeah

74
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
You have with these days

75
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,100
All right, so wait, okay, so it's been so funded man because at what point does it become a liability, you know

76
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,280
Like how how can they fulfill all those orders, you know, they were expecting to fulfill a few thousand now

77
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,360
They've got to fill a few tens of thousand. That's just a logistical nightmare

78
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,120
So that's what's kind of put me off the GPD. So here's it looks awesome. So that's a great point Joanne

79
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,000
So here's what I want to do because we have a unique opportunity Todd from purism is joining us right now

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,320
So I want to get to him because I think you could be our resident expert on crowdfunding

81
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,640
But at first before we go to Todd, I wanted I want to ask wimpy. Are you hedging your bets?

82
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:23,000
You're you're backing two different portable hardware devices. Like you sir are crazy. What you must really want this form factor

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,260
I do really want this form factor. And also as I've said before just recently

84
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,680
Bitcoin is

85
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,680
Trending really nicely

86
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:40,440
I'm making a few luxurious purchases around backing. Yeah, I've also bought something old and crusty as well

87
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,040
Which I can talk about later if you're really yeah, I am

88
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:51,800
So I saw the GPD and I thought that looks very interesting and I'm sort of 5050 as to whether or not we'll ever see it

89
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,940
Because there's a lot of renders and maybe they've now they've got you know, loads of backers there. Maybe it'll happen

90
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:04,380
Well, we'll we'll see what happens, but I'm not sure it's a little bit almost shady some of it. Yeah

91
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,540
the actual

92
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,060
prototypes now

93
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:14,580
Yeah, yeah, though they have shipped a product in the past that's very similar and it was on indiegogo and it did ship

94
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:20,580
Yeah, too many hackers. So they do at least have successful products in the past sure that were crowdfunded

95
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,220
It was it was when it was first announced that there was lots of renders and not much substance and it was just a little case

96
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,820
We're indiegogo. Yeah. Anyway, so that's that one's that looks interesting, but then the Gemini

97
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,380
Again, so this is an organization that really has sort of previous in in this area

98
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,020
They've worked in this space a lot before

99
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:47,860
And I bumped into them at MWC as well. So I had the had the opportunity to press the flesh

100
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,540
so

101
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:57,220
Yeah, I I've backed that because I think that that I think that will probably arrive later than they're hoping because they don't have all

102
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,220
of the manufacturing pipeline

103
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,300
Arranged yet unless they get you know, really good at that and that all comes together quickly

104
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,880
But I think when that one ships it will be the better device in terms of the way

105
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,520
It's designed and the ergonomics and things. Yeah, okay. It's interesting to hear how everybody now

106
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,820
I think we've all sort of we've shifted our expectations in what we get from crowdfunding here

107
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,820
Everybody's like well, this is kind of rolling the dice here

108
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,500
But Todd I wanted to toss to you first of all

109
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,380
Welcome to Linux unplugged and to Joe's point when you have phenomenal success

110
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,700
You have almost you've almost gone too far. You can't as a small company

111
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:38,980
Is it difficult to sort of now meet that demand which could start with what could possibly start a whole snowball effect of bad PR

112
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,700
Struggling for a new company. What are your reflections on this story Todd?

113
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,020
Yeah, well, thanks for having me on

114
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,420
So it obviously is a can be a challenge crowdfunding is you know?

115
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,400
Still really relatively new as a way to start a business and a lot of times

116
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,060
What will end up happening is, you know, especially if they're just you know

117
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,740
If we're talking about like a developer who says hey, I always want to do this or they get together with their buddies

118
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:12,540
And they're like, yeah, we think we think our cost is probably around, you know X dollars and what ends up happening is

119
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,820
To operate a business. Of course, it's you know, it's X times four usually

120
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,580
right, so it so that's one of the things that

121
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:28,180
Tends to to underfund you meaning on a per quantity basis. So they might know a lot of

122
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,860
Projects that

123
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:38,660
That they get overfunded and oversubscribed which of course is a great problem initially when you think hey, this is awesome

124
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,660
People are really excited what we're doing

125
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:46,580
but then I think to Wimpy's point was that when you're actually looking at a per

126
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,580
Cost per item that you need to start scaling your operations, right?

127
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,580
You have to start dealing with how you're managing inventory

128
00:09:53,900 --> 00:10:00,380
Right the entire operational side of things which a lot of those types of campaigns don't end up having so it

129
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,620
you

130
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,980
know the sadly a crowdfunding track record is is not as good as

131
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,460
As we'd all like it to be because obviously it's such a great way to you know to get these things

132
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,420
Off the ground and you know see projects and it's sort of a new way to start businesses

133
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,020
really what they tend to do is

134
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:27,140
kind of stay in the hobby area or obviously, you know delivery is I think I think I could safely say that

135
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,340
99% of the projects are delivered late

136
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,140
Because that's just you know, the nature of the beast, especially when you're dealing with hardware

137
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,740
Yeah

138
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,260
Yeah

139
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:41,300
especially it seems to when it's something that's pushing the edge a little bit where you might have to get manufacturers on board with

140
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,660
A new idea or a new way of doing something or shipping in a way

141
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,820
They've never shipped before it seems like the the the difficulty gets exponentially tougher

142
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,340
Do you agree with that assessment Todd? Yes, I think you're exactly right and and so like in our case

143
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,820
We actually I've had a previous company use the same exact supply chain

144
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,820
and

145
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
but that's that

146
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:10,460
You know just made it where I had the contacts to be able to do things that we were trying to do

147
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,180
But but you know, we obviously had a lot of learning curves along the way

148
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,860
Mostly it was around

149
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,820
You know delivery times or what products were actually available

150
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:28,100
And obviously even one of the things Chris that you might remember is that we were originally slated to get 4k screens

151
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,300
So we said yeah, we can do 4k screens because we heard from the supply chain

152
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,060
We can do 4k screens and then that ended up turning into

153
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:41,220
You know constant delays because the the actual source manufacturer of Samsung was getting bought up by

154
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,620
much larger suppliers

155
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,820
Or much larger buyers and so so we kept kind of falling to the back burner

156
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,180
and then at some point we just had to you know, cut our losses and say, you know

157
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,660
what we're gonna have to we're gonna have to ship what we can right now and then

158
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,860
and then

159
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:05,620
Basically place another order with a more reliable supply chain. So it really that supply chain management is an area that is

160
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,980
Really difficult to manage through

161
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:15,620
you know and now we ended up after we've just because we've grown to the point where we can have a really solid supply chain and

162
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,740
Through negotiation and really to some degrees trial and error

163
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,460
But a lot of the new new

164
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,840
Crowdfunded campaigns that that is I think wimpy's point is exactly right when you start to get

165
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:33,820
Oversubscribed then they introduce all sorts of new problems, right? It's not just like a hobby putting this together

166
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,820
They're trying to actually now start to form a business and if they didn't get their pricing, right?

167
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,060
It could end up being

168
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:46,020
That that they won't be able to actually fund the entire process, right if they don't have if they don't have

169
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,620
experience working with manufacturers and

170
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,220
Like to your point which I don't really think a lot of us think about

171
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,180
if they get to a certain size now all of a sudden they have to also have experience with managing inventory and

172
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:04,380
Tracking support issues and support staff that if you don't have the past experience standing those groups up and integrating those employees into your business

173
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,180
You know

174
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,300
It's gonna be a huge learning curve while you're also trying to ship the product that you just promised everybody

175
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,580
It's like zero to medium-sized business today

176
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,620
So I'm glad wimpy is risking the Bitcoin on it because I really want to see both of these be successful because I love the form

177
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,220
Factor idea totally. So thanks with me. Yeah

178
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,340
Yeah, and you know if I end up with two of these then one will be for my daughter. So that'll be fun. That's nice

179
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,580
Yeah, that's that's brilliant. Well Todd. Thanks for being here and I hope you stick with us

180
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,180
We got a whole bunch of stuff coming up

181
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,020
I just want to give a quick heads up to folks that may be using last pass

182
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,380
I've been looking at different password managers recently if that wasn't obvious and

183
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,900
And

184
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:45,220
It's that time again, and I keep coming back when it comes to mobile integration and stuff like that. I keep preferring last pass

185
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,460
So I this applies to me

186
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,640
I don't know if some of you are out there but over the weekend a Google security researcher reported a new client side vulnerability

187
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,900
So this is in the browser side, which could be potentially dangerous

188
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,860
There is an update now last pass is not giving us the details

189
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,420
Maybe those tech snap guys will keep an eye out for the details on what the actual vulnerability was

190
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,900
But right now as of yesterday

191
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,420
The the word from last passes is just update and we'll tell you all the details soon

192
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:17,100
Or maybe Google actually will because a lot of times that Google project zero blog. Yeah sure has that stuff

193
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,060
Speaking of tech snap we should mention more often that you can find more of mr.

194
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:27,380
Wes on the tech snap program was it last week you guys did a deep dive was it or is the week before last week?

195
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,300
Broke from the traditional format and did a deep dive into bacula, which is such a badass

196
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:38,980
Backup system that Dan knows very well. Yes, he does. Yeah, he's a bacula guy and I tell you what?

197
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,780
If you've ever been curious about a really rock-solid backup system, it can do bare metal restores

198
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,180
It can do individual file restores

199
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,060
It can it can really manage a lot of day sets of data

200
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,340
Bacula and check out the last week's episode tech snap about it, which is an open source. I

201
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,940
Used to use bacula. Oh, really? Yeah, I used to use it to back up a company that sold antivirus

202
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,740
Nice yeah, that makes sense and it works great for something like that. Yeah, and it was perfect

203
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,460
It really was so that's a different time. You don't know now I might use it with digital ocean

204
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,180
I could picture it digital ocean comm go over there

205
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,780
In fact do me a favor after you sign up

206
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,900
You can get a $10 credit and support the show by applying the promo code do on a plug to your account

207
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,100
I like the way that this works too because you can you fund the account?

208
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,020
Yeah, so this is just one of the funding methods you can find it with PayPal or credit card or probably pixie dust

209
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,900
But use the promo code. I'm not sure about that last one do unplugged one word you get a $10 credit

210
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,540
You can spin up a linux rig up on their infrastructure all SSDs for the storage

211
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,940
Wes it makes a difference. It sure does you know what also would help with that bacula thing

212
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:42,300
They're private networking dude you mean for like backing up your own droplet stuff

213
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:47,120
Yes, because also that's brilliant a because then your backup server isn't on the public net

214
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,300
But be the transfer all over the private networking doesn't count towards your total data transfer. Oh, that's money right there

215
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,580
That's a good idea yeah check that out

216
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,500
So one of the many great features of digital ocean go over there use our promo code do unplugged and spin up a rig you

217
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,940
Can try out bacula for just a few pennies on the dollar if you want to run it for a few hours?

218
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:07,180
Try out the $5 rig two months for free it's gonna be all SSD

219
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,420
So it's nice and fast and if you want to back up to digital ocean

220
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:15,260
They have block storage which you can add up and add up and add up and just keep growing as you need or even reduce

221
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,300
Or this is brilliant didn't realize this until recently move it to another droplet

222
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:25,540
Freaking mind-blown in the context of backups freaking mind-blown

223
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,780
It's and that's just the beginning to if you're into this kind of stuff

224
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,900
You might also fight you might also favor their new monitoring system coming soon

225
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,620
It's gonna be coming I little birdie tells me very soon

226
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,260
And you can sign up for early access when you go to digital ocean comm go there create an account big

227
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,300
Thank you digital ocean have a great interface for managing all of this an API that really works

228
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:50,780
Hell of a good service at digital ocean comm use our promo code do unplugged and thanks to them for sponsoring the unplugged program

229
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
okay, so I want to talk just briefly about

230
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,820
File servers, I know I know some people's eyes are gonna glaze over

231
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,740
But there's one that we don't talk about very much, and I want to give it a little love right now

232
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,060
And that's rock store. I've mentioned it once before but a couple of days ago. I missed it first

233
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,300
They had a new release and I think it's worth mentioning

234
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:14,140
Because they've put a ton of release a ton of effort into this they have now six contributors coming together

235
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:21,160
To work on bug fixes and performance improvements the code quality is from what people tell me has had a big jump in this one

236
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,340
They've had a lot of improvements to their Python back-end stack

237
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:31,300
They are still and this could be actually I think a feature to some of you all in on butter FS for the NAS file server

238
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,540
File system so if you're a big fan of butter fest which people remain fans

239
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:42,540
This is a great file server for you potentially they also seem to offer some some commercial products or offerings

240
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:47,860
I'm not totally familiar with support available as well. Yeah, maybe we'll make you feel a little more secure. Yeah

241
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,900
But if that's file system underneath so rock store

242
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,980
Just had a had a new release with which sounds like a lot of nice refinements and improvements

243
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,980
Which is pretty much exactly what you want from your NAS yeah now on the other end

244
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,020
there is

245
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,740
Free NAS coral, which is also known as free NAS 10. This is a

246
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,820
Massive release in my opinion for free NAS. It's it's big

247
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:18,260
It's it's sort of in some ways a total revisioning of the way the UI works. It's got a brand new slick UI

248
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,840
it's got a rewritten middleware architecture and

249
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:31,840
The big and probably one that has gotten the most discussion changes. There's they're transitioning from using jails for plugins to

250
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,860
Using Docker can say what Docker containers isn't that a Linux the Docker?

251
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,040
containers with full ZFS integration and a new command line and

252
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,200
There is some caveats if you're migrating from free NAS 9

253
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,600
Your plugins that you have installed via jails. They don't get deleted

254
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,840
They just get deactivated and you'll have to kind of come up with your own solution to maybe converting those into Docker containers

255
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:06,760
Now this is this is interesting because I think this is probably one of the biggest competitors in this sort of rock store sort of Linux

256
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,680
You know the household date. Yeah. Yeah friend free NAS is

257
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,680
Making huge changes and along those are also some of the changes on the back end team

258
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,560
Jordan Hubbard, who I've had the pleasure of meeting and watching a presentation on free NAS 10 at

259
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,400
meet BSD who seemed to me a big part of the project he's

260
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,400
He's moving on

261
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,600
Now he was the main dev. So he's also the CTO of IX systems. So that's a that's a big change

262
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,960
He's sounds like he's you know moving into something that he's gonna be super passionate about so

263
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,240
He's going into I think like that. Yeah, he says the nanotech biomedical field. It's a complete career change

264
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,400
Wow, yeah, yeah, which that's got to be nice from time to time. So really reinvigorate. Yeah

265
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,960
Good for him, but it's got to be a huge change also back in December. They had another long-time

266
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:58,520
Free NAS developer who was with free NAS since version 8 7 years

267
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,440
He's also moving on from free NAS

268
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,440
So some big changes Jonathan says that he will not be or Jordan not Jonathan. Sorry, Jordan Hubbard

269
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:12,360
Jordan says that I don't know Jonathan Jordan Hubbard says that he won't be a developer anymore, but he'll still be part of the community

270
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,120
So Jordan's still gonna be in the you know as a user, right says he'll be filing bugs and yelling at those devs

271
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:24,640
And some people have speculated. Well, is this because of all of the breakage from upgrading from free NAS 9 to 10, but I

272
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,480
Don't buy it. I don't buy it because free NAS free NAS

273
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,560
9.10 is still available for download still supported like you don't have to upgrade

274
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:39,720
Yeah, and you can roll back your upgrade if it goes wrong, so I don't really buy that like Jordan was pushed out

275
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,840
Which is what read it there right at the reddit conspiracy theories right now that the free NAS 10 was such a failure that it pushed

276
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,240
Jordan out which seems a little a little over the top, but if he was just pushed out

277
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,680
He'd probably go to a company with similar interests or do something in a similar vein not change careers completely

278
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,800
Yeah, I agree. I just I don't know

279
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,040
I think what it was is he what he worked on this until it was done

280
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,640
And he got you know something he sort of got it some stuff wrapped up, and now he's a natural type

281
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,120
It's like it's like a nice smooth transition. Yeah

282
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,840
and it I

283
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,560
The but all that is my way of saying there is there is some there is some

284
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,000
Some pushback on this new release this free NAS coral. I'm sure there is yeah

285
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,240
And I wonder if things like unraid or another Linux out-of-the-box file server could step up to fill the gap

286
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,520
I don't know a free NAS is got a pretty big lead at this point and

287
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,280
Like I said version 9 still perfectly good still perfectly usable still perfectly

288
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,120
But you do have to wonder I mean there was even a question to the Texas program about what's that support cycle gonna be which I?

289
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,720
Was I'm sure it's gonna be very reasonable. You know especially since there's a community around it

290
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,840
That's what it seems not that worried

291
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,320
But you do have to think like you know like you've been talking about like if you're planning in the next five years

292
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,240
I mean it would probably still work for that time frame, but ten years

293
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,840
What do you think about Docker? I mean that's an interesting

294
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,520
Interesting the doctor just win right there the doctor just win like I can't see it from their perspective of does that

295
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,160
Much easier like if it's packaged at Docker is it now pretty easy for them to make sure it works in their environment

296
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,360
Versus having to put together plugins with their own custom jail format that kind of thing

297
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:18,000
To me it seems to represent like sort of the industry even even the people on the BSD side of the fence coming to a

298
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
recognition that

299
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,040
Well, if you want to be able to distribute software that runs across multiple platforms

300
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,240
Dockers

301
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,920
Just the container technology we're gonna use and it's not so much that they're like betting on Docker so much as they want to

302
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:38,120
Make all of the stuff that's already in a container available to free nas so they instead of having reaches

303
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,800
Yeah, instead of having to have a plug-in author who creates something specifically for a free nas now

304
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,480
Just exactly Joe free nas using a container

305
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,240
Specifically for a free nas now just exactly Joe free nas user can pull down a Docker container

306
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,680
Do we know yet how they're doing it? Is it using it's probably still using jail. That's what I would others

307
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,960
It's just that the Docker format gives you this like universal format to package the thing up with and then she you know

308
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,080
I wonder I don't look controls that just work

309
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,700
I wonder because the way they say listen to the way they put this

310
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,440
Support for Docker containers its own built-in hypervisor that supports virtualization with full ZFS integration

311
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,120
So to me, it sounds like they're using a hypervisor to run this and they would have like a Linux kernel

312
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,080
It'd be you think they're able to run Linux Docker images. This is where they're going with this. They are Linux dockers

313
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,920
No, they are Linux dock because you're because they're making it available for you to pull down pre-created Docker containers

314
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,560
Then it's probably yeah beehive with Linux running on top of it. Yeah

315
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,200
That's to me is a huge statement. Yeah. Hmm. Don't you think?

316
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,680
That's pretty cool

317
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,560
That's sort of like when Microsoft started shipping Docker support and bash on Windows. It's just sort of like this

318
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,680
Linux is the runtime Linux is the runtime and however you get that runtime on your machine sure

319
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,200
Yeah, and the container technology is the is how you get the runtime right now

320
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,960
But it's really but those half of those containers are running Ubuntu, right?

321
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:03,040
So it's it's really Linux is the platform. Yeah, and in a lot of those cases, it's Ubuntu 70% There you go

322
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
Yeah

323
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:10,000
So it's that's that I think they came up with a way to run Ubuntu on free NAS

324
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,120
Let's look more into this

325
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,360
I'm very curious about it because I wonder if it'll create any pressure for their

326
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,720
Compact layer to implement those primitives, you know

327
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,440
Is they're just using beehive with a Linux kernel, right?

328
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
Didn't have to run a whole hypervisor

329
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,120
Support like OCI or other types of things that suddenly you could have like hey

330
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,160
I want to run for BSD as my you know base platform for Kubernetes or whatever most reliably

331
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,500
Using the hypervisor route is probably the best way

332
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,760
Yeah, don't yeah to start and maybe down the road they allow you to pick whether it's using the ABI or using a hypervisor

333
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,440
Yeah, and I think that's what Microsoft is doing up and at

334
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,800
230 the file system upgrade just finished on the phone

335
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,320
So in from to hot. Yes. There you go. The real the file system in real time is completed

336
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,120
Oh, geez, now I got to sign in. What is this crap just for one point release?

337
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,480
Does this mean if Ubuntu is running on freedom?

338
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,040
Yes, does that mean we can get snaps running as well? Well, if you I wouldn't you if you could run Docker containers on there

339
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,080
Couldn't you just run essentially like a small Ubuntu system?

340
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,320
And that's the stage. Yeah, you could and you could make snaps on it as well if you wanted to

341
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,120
Fascinating that is interesting. I really want to see what the web UI I've looked at the early betas

342
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,400
I would don't know they have supported this do you all right? So it would make sense that they might

343
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,700
Yeah, they have another built-in via they have a section called VMs, right? Exactly. Exactly

344
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,200
It's just that's what I would think it just another built-in VM

345
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,800
So it's something I think I'm gonna play around with now that I can get Linux on my free NAS

346
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
This is a game changer for me

347
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,560
But it's a big controversial feature in the free NAS community right now. Oh, I'm sure

348
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:47,760
All right. Well, there you go. I thought that was oh, oh and by the way, if you are going to upgrade

349
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,760
Let me see I have

350
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:56,440
Somewhere in this mess of show notes. Here we go. I have a migrating from free NAS 9 to free NAS coral

351
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,320
Entry on the free NAS wiki place that covers all of it and like issues you have

352
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,560
Especially for using encryption maybe just give this a read doesn't sound like it's gonna be too complicated

353
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:12,480
But probably stuff you should be aware of so check that out. I have all that go try the new version

354
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,160
I'd love to hear you think about it. Do you have a file server at home?

355
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,280
not anything

356
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,800
pre built like this

357
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:25,400
Hmm. I have a I have a box that has a container that runs my router and that it has a container that you know

358
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,480
Yeah, if you just if you just built a big desktop PC, you could put a bunch of disks in it

359
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,440
I sure could and you could just use that

360
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,600
Like a double duty. Hmm. All right, listen to that. We're gonna talk about your new machine

361
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,320
We're gonna go spend your money here. We're gonna go spend your money here just about now actually

362
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,000
So, uh, I think it's just about time. Let's so let's do that

363
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,760
Let's let's actually let's mention Linux Academy Linux Academy comm slash unplugged then we're gonna go home man

364
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,680
West see my favorite thing to do is to spend other people's money and I'm gonna get you set up much more fun

365
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,600
We're gonna get you hooked up

366
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,280
We're gonna get you hooked up with a good machine and then when you're ready to put that machine to use and you want to

367
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,560
Do more I want you to go to Linux Academy and learn more Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

368
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,280
You land there to support the show and sign up for a free seven-day trial

369
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,280
It's a platform to learn more about

370
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:15,120
The Linux with self-paced in-depth video courses hands-on real-world scenarios that help shake off that test anxiety because you've got actual

371
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,560
Expertise I love it

372
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,400
They spin up the lab server when you need it you SSH into that shenanigans

373
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:25,600
You get a real environment seven plus Linux distros you choose from the servers and the courseware. I'll snap

374
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,960
See what I did there to that distro. I'll snap to that distro

375
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,120
You can also take practice exams to like prepare for a cert test

376
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,960
You can get note cards have been forked by the community improved you get nuggets

377
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,880
Which are just tiny bits of wisdom you just do a little deep dive into a singular topic for five minutes or an hour depending

378
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,960
On the subject which is great when you've got a busy week speaking of busy weeks

379
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,520
They have course schedulers to work with you to help match content to your busy

380
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:56,840
Schedule a community stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members downloadable tools like guides and lesson audio that you can take with you

381
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,440
iOS and Android apps to study on the go damn

382
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,040
Damn, the list just keeps getting longer and longer, and they're always adding more courseware

383
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,960
You can just look at their Twitter feed to see that

384
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,640
It's just it's so awesome that something like this where you sign up once and then they just keep working their butts off to get

385
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:17,160
You more and more stuff Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

386
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:23,660
Linux Academy comm slash unplugged so if we're not gonna do the Raspberry Pi with a keyboard for you Wes

387
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,940
It sounds like you are what can you tell people what you got right now give people a base?

388
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,080
So they know what you're coming from right now. I've got a

389
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,920
core i5

390
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:40,520
Was it second generation third what generation is this one? I think first that might be my first yeah first gen XPS

391
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,040
Yeah, with a I think that was the first gen i5 yeah 13 inch screen 13 inch screen

392
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:52,000
And what's the resolution of the screen 13 whatever yep? Yep, so that's the icing on this horrible cake

393
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,600
Oh my good, which at home. I have external monitors, so it's not that big of a deal

394
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,160
But has the monitor hookup display port yeah, okay, all right, so that'd probably still be the same. Yeah, so that's fine

395
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,040
I'm SSD SSD and four gigs eight gigs four gigs of room. Oh my god. Oh

396
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,640
My god, okay, wow yeah, we really got a talk

397
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,160
So 13 inch now. What do you like most about that form factor? I mean it is very convenient. It's not a heavy machine

398
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,560
It's easy to throw in a bag. I think I could do up to a 15-inch

399
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:27,040
As long as it wasn't you know crazy. I would like to like you don't be able to easily take it to a coffee shop

400
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,520
Or a bar to do some work, okay, okay?

401
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,080
All right, well see I was I was going to recommend. I was gonna recommend something a little bigger

402
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,900
I was gonna recommend you've ever seen this Acer here with the with the 20 inch curved screen

403
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:50,960
Okay, maybe not maybe not it looks like it has a nice keyboard though are those is that like a real keyboard yeah, man

404
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,880
Yeah, yeah, that's legit right there. Not the dumb pad not the dumb. No. It's the rest. It's like a mechanical keyboard

405
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,440
That's also the numpad actually comes out and can be a trackpad. Oh wow it flips over

406
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:08,080
Yeah, isn't that sweet so not that that's too big yeah, so what do you like least about the form factor?

407
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,040
Did you feel constrained on the screen and you must oh yes?

408
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,140
So it's not it's not that bad like I honestly spent a lot of the time

409
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,120
I have like you know a chat program or two

410
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,800
But once at a time a terminal and a web browser, so it's not that bad

411
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,840
But when I'm away from home, and I'm trying to do some development

412
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,400
Which I need you know like a couple terminals and a web browser then suddenly I'm all tabbing over the place

413
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,680
It's you see okay, so on not just because they're friends of the show

414
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,680
But it seems like something like the galago pro

415
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:41,120
Would be a pretty strong contender for you what you have to decide here is do you want to go bigger than 13 inch screen or

416
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,780
Not because I think that's that's the classifier

417
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,300
It sounds like you're leaning 15 inch I mean

418
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:54,620
The 13 inch I like 13 14 even I think I think I would be okay with a 15 inch

419
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,740
That's where it kind of forks the discussion. Maybe a little bit as well

420
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:02,660
Do I also want to consider building a new desktop rig right?

421
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:07,300
Okay, I haven't built a desktop and a desktop or or you know maybe not of the laptop

422
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,060
I guess there's both option. I would still like a new laptop

423
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:17,140
but if I have a nice desktop at home that beats I could have a you know a different yeah, I would probably want a

424
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,260
13 inch or

425
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,820
But how are these options with Thunderbolts e GPUs and I'm gonna be for your laptop

426
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,340
So here's what I think so I think we should I think we should do this

427
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,380
I think we should do this since people at home are probably thinking some of the same stuff

428
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:35,220
I think we should break that particular the desktop into a separate conversation because I think we can quickly get there because I think that might

429
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:41,060
Be the way to go. Although although there are some super nice laptops. Like is it called Kratos?

430
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:46,260
Is that how you pronounce it wimpy the Kratos Kratos? Yes, it's the entroware Kratos

431
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:52,240
That looks like a nice real. Yeah, if you're on this side of the Atlantic so in Europe

432
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,440
They've just released their new updated version of that which

433
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:01,780
Is an i7 and it goes up to 32 gigs of RAM and it's got an Nvidia

434
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:04,780
1050 in it GTX 1050

435
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,900
15 inch display that matters

436
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:14,640
Yeah, 15 inches kind of tasty. I think I think Wes you really deserve dedicated graphics if you can

437
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,660
There's something there's another route you could consider

438
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,140
This is something I know you've been looking at. That's why I bring this up

439
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,820
So audience behind the scenes Wes has been reading up a little bit about using

440
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:30,220
Say like a Thunderbolt cable to hook up an external GPU. You could also go this route

441
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,860
So if we go if we if we keep this in mind, this also opens up your your possibilities

442
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,940
I just don't know how well this kind of thing works with Linux

443
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:42,860
I'd love to know if anybody in the audience or in the Mamba room has any any information about external Thunderbolt

444
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:49,500
GPUs with Linux looks like WWS get something you do www. I got something on the windows side

445
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:57,740
Okay, so from I've only seen one person on YouTube actually test what Thunderbolting an external video card

446
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:04,180
What the performance is actually like and from that one series of like two videos?

447
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,740
It's a 30 to 40 percent decrease from desktop performance

448
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:17,860
For a 4 to 12 percent gain and that is if you're using the monitor hooked up to the external

449
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:24,620
Right right GPU unit. So I mean that's all windows your performance could vary wildly

450
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:31,660
Very you happen to know what what connection interface they're using if it was Thunderbolt 2 or 3 because I mean I think it was

451
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,100
Thunderbolt 3

452
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,660
Wow, I think most of the gear is Thunderbolt 3 driven

453
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:42,420
Thunderbolt 3 those 40 gigabits it is it what's cool is if you get a laptop that has the Thunderbolt 3

454
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,500
But it also has the reverse feed display port

455
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,540
So the graphics card can feed a display port back in and power the screen

456
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:53,100
Because like the Apple I want to say just the MacBook or the MacBook Pro can do that

457
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,980
And I know there are other laptops

458
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:59,340
I think like the razor blade and stuff can do that where you can plug in the external GPU and still use the laptop

459
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:04,300
Monitor with the external GPU feeding it instead a lot of people in the chat room have been suggesting razor blade

460
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:09,580
Have you looked at razor? I have done. I mean, I'm really aware of the price. Aren't they horrible with Linux though?

461
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,580
Are they are they so?

462
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:19,220
see this is this is this is the thing Wes is I I would I would encourage you to really get your head around what screen

463
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,940
size you want and

464
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,700
Really draw the line somewhere for me personally over the years having right next to me

465
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:30,980
I have my Librem right right now and I and I have the Apollo and one is a 13 inch and one is a 15 inch and

466
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,660
It if I want something that I take on the couch

467
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,740
I like the 13 inch if I want something that I'm gonna work from I like the 15 inch

468
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,140
It's just so it's really what you're gonna use it for. What are you gonna?

469
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:44,260
Is it more of a work machine or is it more of a browse the web have fun machine?

470
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,720
Honestly probably more of a work machine

471
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,940
I mean, I will use it in a casual capacity but portability do you take it with you to work?

472
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,980
Not to work, but I like to work out of the house a lot of my own personal projects show work that kind of thing

473
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:03,920
Yeah, that's where this really fails. How much time do you spend looking at the screen when you're doing that sort of stuff?

474
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,740
What do you mean?

475
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:11,620
When you're working on your own stuff and you want to use it, you know for working on your own projects

476
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:15,820
How much time might you be spending at the computer then those those moments?

477
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,220
Uh, I would say anywhere from two to six hours. Whoa

478
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:25,700
Depending okay. Jeez. I can't believe you've put up with that resolution for this long. I would not I would not man

479
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,500
That's gotta be rough. Well, that's how I find myself here today

480
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,340
Good for you. I'm really proud of you for taking so what?

481
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:37,420
So I've effectively got the same machine. I've got a 13 inch and a 15 inch variant

482
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:44,620
so it's the 13 inch XPS and the 15 inch XPS and the 13 inch XPS is what I take out when I'm going

483
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:48,480
Traveling that's the device. I sure because it's small. It's powerful

484
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,300
It's no compromise

485
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:58,900
But for extended periods working on that machine, it's not so great because 13 inch screen

486
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,700
You do find yourself, you know, you can't quite get close enough to it now

487
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,100
That's probably compounded by the fact that that's a high DPI screen

488
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:15,100
That's right. So I've actually been thinking about potentially selling that XPS 13 and getting the version with the

489
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,180
1080p screen

490
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,340
Because I think that would be better to work on

491
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,740
For longer periods. Oh, yeah, that's an interesting point

492
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,580
Yeah, and I'm not like I don't need a touchscreen. I don't have I mean, they're nice

493
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,140
I would maybe occasionally use it but not a deal breaker

494
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:38,500
I says it looks like razors working the razor core which is their external eGPU with a 970 in it hooked up to an XPS

495
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:44,340
13 running on arch looks like it's working to power an external monitor. That's in the XPI, you know interesting

496
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:48,060
I really like these most links for that somewhere. He put in the chat room. I

497
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:54,780
Really like I really like the XPS 13, but if it was my only computer

498
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,180
I would probably opt for the 15. Yeah, and wimpy

499
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,380
What was the battle like to put because this thing only ships with Windows

500
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,980
So what was the what was the process like to put Linux on?

501
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:09,220
Is it just a format nuke pave install Linux or is there some did you replace Wi-Fi and whatnot?

502
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,220
so I got my

503
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:18,260
machines both from Adele reseller and they were able to sell the

504
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:26,460
XPS 15 with a configuration that had the same Wi-Fi chip in it as the XPS 13 developer edition

505
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,700
So I didn't have to do any

506
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:34,860
Monkeying around it obviously arrived with Windows 10 on it, which was actually quite helpful because

507
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,660
Around the time I got mine sort of September last year

508
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:42,740
they were just working out the last of the firmware bugs in the BIOS and

509
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,940
So you did it anyway?

510
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,540
So yeah, I needed to do the updates anyway

511
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:53,060
So it was quite handy to have that do the updates and then it's just been running Ubuntu ever since hmm

512
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:59,160
Hmm. Yeah, I I wonder if even now if the latest model even would have if you'd have to replace the Wi-Fi

513
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:03,420
That may not be an issue anymore. Yeah, and I mean I'm comfortable doing that

514
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:09,660
It'd make me happier if it had a if it had a 10 series card. It has a GTX 960. It's not a hard swap

515
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,700
I've done it. You just take the bottom off and it's right there

516
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:17,860
It's not a hard swap at all and you can just get a replacement card on Amazon for like 35 bucks 60 bucks

517
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,980
But that seems like that seems like a decent way to go. Alright, so that is I so

518
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:26,780
You're so if you go if you go into like the 15 inch range that you know

519
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,540
There's some there's some nice machines there

520
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:34,200
but you said something that I think is probably the more exciting thing to consider because it's something I've gone through myself is

521
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:39,740
What if I do something like an ultrabook or even this is crazy, but even like a chromebook

522
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,420
Yeah

523
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,940
And then I get myself like a six core or more I seven machine

524
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:50,580
32 gigs of RAM lots of storage and you just go all out and plus it's kind of fun if you haven't done it for

525
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,580
A while to build a PC like when's the last time you built a PC?

526
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,980
Ages yeah ages. Yeah, it's like seven years or something. So if you've been on laptops for years now

527
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,660
Okay, so we got to talk about this because I did this

528
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:05,700
There's like a gaming rig kind of thing, but it's not like new has a nice graphics card, but older processor

529
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:10,540
So yeah, it's not where you're working. It's not where I'm working. No. Yeah. Hmm. Okay. All right, so

530
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:16,100
So I I I recently made this transition myself where I was on all laptops for years

531
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,260
Even the machines here at the table, right? Oh, yeah looking back at it seems

532
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,980
Really crazy. Yeah ludicrous. It seems ludicrous

533
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:27,420
Absolutely ludicrous and now cuz now you just it blows my mind

534
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:31,940
Yeah, so let's ludicrous. That could be your new handle Chris ludicrous

535
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,340
Like that

536
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:39,220
That's not bad. That's not bad. You know, what else is ludicrous ting go to linux.ting.com

537
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,340
You'll save twenty five dollars off your first device and support the show

538
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:47,780
If you already have a GSM or CDMA device that works check their BYOD page you get twenty five dollars in service credit

539
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:52,820
That's nice because it's six bucks for the line and then just your usage on top of that for minutes messages megabytes

540
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:57,340
I was having a telegram conversation today with I think it might have been it might have been Cory

541
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:01,840
I can't remember it on telegram. You see Chris is my mom does not want data on her phone

542
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,100
And he says can I use ting anyways?

543
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,900
I said actually thing would be perfect because you can just go in and completely turn data off

544
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,500
I guess I guess his mom like had a bad experience with data

545
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:17,100
Happens but and not Brent Spiner data, but what that one time you get that extra bill. Yeah

546
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:22,140
Hey, that's it. I just want phone calls. And so he goes in there can turn it right off boom

547
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,780
That's the thing team makes it so easy

548
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,780
And if you do want it, it's super easy to set like hey, let me know what I've crossed this boundary

549
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,980
Yeah, or if you just want to turn it back on just go check a box

550
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,540
They got apps for the phone to manage all of it

551
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:36,500
They've also got a great website and customer service that really sets the bar you get to talk to real human beings

552
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,580
So all of that combined with the fact that they're a really cool company with geeks that work there

553
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:43,580
They're really into this stuff and they follow stuff like on their blog all the time

554
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:48,180
They've got the moto g5 plus available now for pre-order that could be kind of quick

555
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,960
That could be kind of a cool device. It's got two. It's got a two gigahertz octa-core processor four gigabytes of RAM

556
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,620
It's like around what I think it's like what 300 bucks for a nice moto smartphone with

557
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:05,500
With damn four gigs of RAM. Damn. I think that's as much as the iPhone's got as much as my laptop

558
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:10,620
Oh, that's so horrible. Oh my god. We got out. We got a talk West. We got a talk

559
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,420
All right. Thank you to Ting for sponsoring the show Linux dot ting.com

560
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:18,420
Oh, yes, I tell you when I made that transition from I know what these are nice laptops, right?

561
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:25,980
Yeah, but no bo's XPS is you have been for laptops now. No, they're good. Yeah, I five I seven processors SSDs

562
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:31,940
This is why I thought and like the bonobos, you know for a while. They were dedicated GTX 510

563
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:36,220
And like the bonobos, you know for a while. They were dedicated GTX graphics cards

564
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,580
What could that in my mind?

565
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:45,020
I understand that some of these things are clock slightly slower and they run slightly slower for for for heat, right?

566
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:51,580
But in them not necessarily in the bonobo, I I don't I couldn't really conceptualize that there would be a

567
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:57,900
noticeable difference in my day-to-day usage couldn't really I even in my main workstation upstairs. I was using a laptop and

568
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:02,780
I'm not just doing that, you know and filter editing show editing. Yeah

569
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:08,540
Try and reviews and then when when it came time like I think I guess it was last year

570
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,580
I can't like was it last year the year before we built new rigs for the last week

571
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:16,340
Yeah, and I one of the things I can if I if it's possible whenever I can I'll buy two of everything

572
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,140
So that way we have a backup because we're live right?

573
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:23,540
I want to have a production machine and a backup machine. And so I bought and so you know what?

574
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:28,300
What if we're gonna build these anyways, I'll buy a third one because I mean I'm like I'm using Bitcoin, right?

575
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,100
It's not like I'm using actual cash here. It's not real money. So it's like

576
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:35,220
Yeah, looking back at it has it been money for ages

577
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:41,260
anyway, so we build a third one slightly nicer configuration because it's my personal workstation and

578
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:47,380
Put it in and I sit down to start working on it and now looking back at it

579
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:55,620
It is it's it's a it's a totally different computing experience. Wow. There is a just a it's something about the just the amount of

580
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:03,460
Sheer work. I can have this one system doing because not only am I doing like things like video encoding and editing and transferring large

581
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,980
Files around the network all at once

582
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:10,380
I've also got YouTube streams telegrams like all this regular desktop my email my web browser like all this huge

583
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:15,980
I've got all this regular desktop stuff going to and then in the back end. I've got usenet. I've got indexers

584
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,780
I've got downloaders extractors. I've got I've got sonar monitoring feeds

585
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:24,540
Like I've got all this other server stuff that this thing's doing that in the past would have been like on its own dedicated machine

586
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:29,900
And it's doing that all of it while I'm doing all this other stuff and it never misses a beat and it's just the sheer

587
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:35,100
Amount of productivity I get out of one machine. I for my main computer. I will never ever

588
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,300
Well, I shouldn't say that I cannot

589
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:44,060
Yeah, I cannot see me going back to laptop for my main work. That's a pretty that's a pretty strong opinion

590
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,580
Plus it takes the pressure off the laptop pick right which is so hard just right

591
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:51,020
Yeah, it doesn't have to be perfect anymore. Just has to yeah fill that niche

592
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,420
So that's anybody in the mumble room have a opposite or similar experience like, you know

593
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:59,320
You switch over to a desktop and it's just a totally different amount of work you get done for me personally

594
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,740
Especially working with video and stuff. I love the fact that I can start an encode job

595
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,600
I get I just gonna run for 15 minutes

596
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,020
I switch over to another desktop and it's like you start even worry about it don't not at all Wow

597
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:15,380
So as someone who's building a lot of software, it's invaluable to have like a dually five machine sitting in a closet somewhere

598
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:20,700
Sort of SSH and for my laptop to be able to build software on 32 threads. Yeah

599
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,900
My my bill I just have to change into everything

600
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:31,540
My build machine is my intro where Athena which is an absolute monster. So that's a laptop

601
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,940
And it's my gaming laptop

602
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:39,780
But when it's not being used for gaming which is infrequently it sits on the desk behind me during the day

603
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,080
And that's the machine that I do all of my builds and what have you on?

604
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,220
See that would be nice because

605
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:50,900
That's a big machine like the one I used to be able to get like a nice ultrabook with a huge battery say like

606
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:56,940
An x270 from Lenovo and be able to go 13 hours without plugging in and you're just SSH ing into your powerful box

607
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,960
So you can get a lot of work done, but still go forever on battery

608
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:05,760
It would be nice as well to have that kind of home base because I don't find this laptop

609
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,240
Especially like when I format it for the show or distro reviews or whatever like it's just not that consistent

610
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,600
So it ends up that I have to promote some like cloud server or droplet or other thing to be my kind of like

611
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,840
That's where I do ansible runs from that's where my main backups from my sink thing are taken or whatever

612
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,840
That might not be a bad strategy

613
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,440
Yeah

614
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,680
But it would be nice for some things to have like a home base that I could that's like me is like I just end up

615
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,480
There's some things. I just want to run on my local machine. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I think you should

616
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,320
I think you should give the idea a serious consideration because if you've made it this long on this machine a

617
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,480
Fairly modest laptop would be a pretty big spec bump so you could do a modest laptop bump and really invest in the desktop

618
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,480
You know it's not it's not all fun though

619
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,320
You know I also I mean you you know we got a stack of dead motherboards right there that right there is a

620
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,000
It's not I don't feel like it's quite as good as it used to be I feel like I get a lot more

621
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,440
Dead-on-arrival parts when I when I custom build now than we used to but you know I guess

622
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,280
It doesn't seem like it's as big as an industry find to me

623
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:07,240
Yeah, so Wes how important is battery life to you um I don't need like

624
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,320
Crazy battery life. I would like you know like five plus

625
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,320
More would more would be nice

626
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:18,800
But I am usually in a position where I could find power or know of you know like my favorite

627
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,280
Establishments to work have a pretty readable power outlets that sort of it

628
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,280
Right so the reason I asked the question is when I got my

629
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:33,280
Entrower Apollo I suddenly walked into a new era of battery endurance that I'd not

630
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:39,640
Experienced before and I got used to having like seven hours plus battery life, and that was pretty great

631
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:45,080
When I got the XPS 13 I was looking for

632
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,880
Touchscreens and high DPI because I wanted to play with all the new toys

633
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:55,840
right and I I'm somewhat jaded because the the trade-off there that you make is

634
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,480
Battery endurance because those high DPI screens and the touchscreen

635
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:09,220
Just arriving in more power. Yeah, so I I will get comfortably four and a half hours on the XPS 13

636
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:17,180
Maybe five at a push, but nothing more than that and that's another reason why I've been considering for the

637
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:22,620
for the XPS 13 perhaps the 1080p model which

638
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:30,100
Doesn't have the touchscreen has a low res screen and the battery life is almost double. Yeah. Yeah, I think I could do

639
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,100
That's my observation as well also

640
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:38,580
You just there's more Linux software that works better at at right regular DPI

641
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,140
You cannot you can definitely make it work

642
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:44,860
Especially if you're working with cute five apps or GTK three apps you really you're gonna have a fine

643
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,740
You're gonna have a fine experience, but almost all of them will screw it up out of the box

644
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,020
So you're gonna you're gonna have to make some tweaks

645
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:55,940
But and I still I still I'm making small refinements to my plasma desktop on the XPS 13

646
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,940
I would I would also agree if you if you don't need it

647
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:04,460
I personally think it's you know, I don't know of any laptops that have the screen resolution, but 2k is perfect

648
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:10,860
Yeah, perfect. Yeah, perfect. It's perfect. Hmm. I really wish we had more 2k screens on laptop

649
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,060
The other thing to consider is on the high DPI

650
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:19,980
laptops most of the 13 inch laptops when you've pixel doubled them are like the equivalent of 1600 by 900 in terms of

651
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:28,020
You know, yeah usable, you know equivalent resolution. Yeah, so you actually have more screen space on a 1080p

652
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,020
hmm when we know it's

653
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:36,060
I'm just I'm just mentioning these things because these are things that I hadn't considered going into my purchasing decision

654
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:38,480
Yeah, I'm now aware of having having made it

655
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,580
I mean I wanted to I in fact, I still want I still want a machine

656
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,780
I can try out high DPI stuff on for review purposes. Yeah, no that makes sense

657
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:46,580
But if you're not doing that, I don't know

658
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,940
Depends like most of my time is at the terminal maybe some like photo editing

659
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,140
But if I had a desktop I could do that there too. Yeah, dude

660
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,940
You can also get a 2k screen for a reasonable price on the desktop

661
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:59,980
That's so I have the new x1 carbon is a 2k screen 14 is it? Oh in case you're curious lick

662
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,300
What now I might have to sell something

663
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:10,740
It's like the infinity display right it's got the thin bezel. Yeah, we were just talking about in the pre-show that pretty cool

664
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,940
Take a look at it. Excellent

665
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,980
See charging on the new ones. Oh, I love that. I'm that would be that would be awesome

666
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:21,820
That would feature the XPS 13 and this that way see charge. Did I take Bitcoin?

667
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,500
Seriously, cuz yeah that oh

668
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,100
70 I'm curious if that also type-c charges off the type-c port on it

669
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,860
So I'm so done with John to type-c me too

670
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:39,740
I was just having a conversation last night with Noah about how I just want everybody to go all in on USB C

671
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,740
Let's just do it. Yeah

672
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:44,140
That's why when I saw the Gallego ultra pro with the new one

673
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,820
See, I was like you guys you better fix this before you ship this

674
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,180
I would really love to see them have USB C on that. Maybe the next rev can do it

675
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:55,700
I'm not sure why they can't do it now, but it is time. It's time for cameras. It's time for everything

676
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:01,380
I want I want to charge my remotes with USB C my phone with USB C my camera my laptop

677
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,940
The thing that did it for me was I bought one of those battery packs

678
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:09,820
But it had one that you could use to jumpstart a car on it and it was chargeable and it used USB C

679
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:15,940
So I was like so in theory if I had my phone I could charge this battery from my phone and then start my car

680
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:21,700
Maybe yeah Wow drain your phone though. Yeah, but whatever I can go drive somewhere. Yeah, exactly

681
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:29,220
Okay, somebody at Chris Ellie asked me a Lenovo reseller that sells the x1 carbon with the end accepts Bitcoin

682
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:34,040
Okay. All right. So there's there's that now wimpy though. You were teasing earlier that you got new hardware

683
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,820
You got something a new device

684
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:40,500
Yes, I have I can't tell you much about it other than what it is, but I have bought a

685
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,060
an old computer

686
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:45,900
I have bought an IBM x200

687
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,860
But this x200 has Libre boot

688
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,560
It's an FSF approved laptop

689
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,740
Now this is a brand new purchase. Oh, you just got you got this old new device

690
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:04,940
This new old arrived it arrived today and other than getting it out of the box and the bubble wrap and turning it on

691
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,460
I haven't done anything with it

692
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:13,580
well hasn't that just isn't that just perfect because Todd's here and I just recently saw news from from purism about

693
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:18,580
Work on Libre boot Todd. Can you bring us up to speed what's going on over with with Libre boot?

694
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,260
Yeah, so

695
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:27,460
Well Libre boot of course is just the port from core boot that removes the binary blobs. So right, right

696
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:32,640
So so which which I guess to I guess can you back up and explain more binary blobs of what?

697
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,360
so

698
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,860
Anything that's built?

699
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:39,820
Pre 2008 you can actually have a core boot

700
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:43,580
Running without any binary blobs, which are of course

701
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:46,320
mystery code that runs at the BIOS level

702
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:53,300
And obviously this is getting more and more attention. Yeah, especially with vault 7 releases where about 90% of those

703
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,140
security based exploits were

704
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,580
EFI or UEFI

705
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,580
exploits so

706
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:07,180
And then obviously so one of the biggest ones and the biggest worry is called the Intel management engine

707
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:11,060
Then there's also something else called Intel AMT

708
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:16,040
That is that actually allows for remote access of your machine when it's even powered off

709
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:20,700
So those are a couple of things that are binaries at the lowest level

710
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:25,700
And the way that I like to describe that is basically from a security standpoint. It's kind of how deep do you go?

711
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,940
and so some people, you know, they'll just like install a

712
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:33,900
You know ad blocker and they think that they're you know happy as it can be

713
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:35,460
And then you know

714
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:38,200
Then you can go deeper down to the operating system where you you know

715
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,740
Do you have binaries that power your wireless card or your graphics, etc?

716
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,400
and then you can go deeper than that which of course gets you to the bootloader and then the

717
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:51,880
Lowest level is the firmware on the machine, which of course is the BIOS or EFI or in our case is core boot

718
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,340
so we actually just

719
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:57,340
ported core boot for the Purism Vibram laptops and

720
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,520
And and then we have also

721
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:05,560
What's called neutralized the management engine which means we've removed the network stack remove the kernel

722
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:12,940
So we have a very small bit of code to reverse engineer or actually just get to the point where we can disable the management

723
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,020
engine and at that point we'd actually qualify for

724
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:20,760
Respects your freedom certification on a brand new i7 6th gen

725
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,740
CPUs. Yeah

726
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:27,780
Yeah, that that's that's how I feel. I just disable the damn thing. Just turn it off. I don't

727
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:32,460
Yeah, that's exactly what's funny about it. Is that I mean, it's one of those things that

728
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:37,580
Initially, I don't think it was like really a nefarious reason why the management engine was initially started

729
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,940
It was part of this sort of business push to

730
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:47,140
To make it where sysadmins and you know remotely control a device at a lower level than the operating system to you know

731
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,860
To reinstall or repair etc

732
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:55,100
And then it turned into this, you know, wow, this can actually be this black box that does a tremendous amount

733
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,140
So that actually now has a separate its own separate core

734
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,620
It's an art core

735
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:05,220
But the thing at the end of the day is that it can be completely removed, right?

736
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:08,580
So we've actually proven it can be completely removed and the machine can operate

737
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:15,180
But it happens to operate for 30 minutes because there's a little watchdog timer that disables the CPU actually powers it off

738
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,460
so now we have

739
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:23,300
Ninety three percent removed the last seven percent is a this watchdog timer

740
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,100
So okay

741
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,460
So you're telling me just to just a pause there

742
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:33,140
In the process of trying to figure out how this damn thing works and how to how to disable it or just bypass it all

743
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:38,120
Together you're getting down the path. Oh my god. I think we got this working high fives all around everybody

744
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:42,460
We did it and then 30 minutes into it. It shuts the system down and it's like then you discover

745
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:48,780
There's a timer in there this that's yeah, that's exactly right. So there is a separate watchdog timer that basically

746
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:54,700
when the machine first powers on there's a signature check against one of the partitions within the

747
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:59,580
Management engines you can think of it like as like a zip file of partitions

748
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:05,500
so but the signature check is only on the very first file or partition of the

749
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:10,900
Management engine so the networking stack and the kernel are in other partitions

750
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:15,600
So we can actually zero out all the partitions except the one that has a signature check

751
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:22,940
And then if the signature check fails, then this watchdog timer triggers for 30 minutes

752
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:29,820
But because we manufacture the motherboard we actually have fusing capabilities that get us a little bit deeper than

753
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,740
Then what would otherwise be there?

754
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:39,500
So we can actually start to really debug and say we can put the CPU in a debug mode or the management engine in a disable

755
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:42,940
Mode, so we're starting to test those features out

756
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:50,660
And obviously the end goal for us is we want to have a device that can operate with completely free software throughout the entire stack

757
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:58,540
From the very first firmware loaded all the way through all the operating system and all the applications that run Todd my my

758
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:03,340
Capitalist sense would tell me that there would be some other

759
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:09,660
Market leader that would seem to want to jump to the call of organizations that want to have more secure

760
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:12,700
Laptops, especially in a post Snowden era

761
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:18,420
It seems like there could be even entire governments that would want computers that are rid of management engine

762
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:25,000
That's controlled by a US corporation. Why in your estimation? Is this something that's not being why is Lenovo not leading this charge?

763
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:31,900
It's yeah, it's such a great question and I don't happen to know the answer because obviously we're focusing on that

764
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:37,140
the the area that I think the only way I can really sort of answer that is that

765
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,740
for us

766
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:43,020
We need it. We we need to have the entire stack and it's really a game of depth

767
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:46,260
So if your operating system if you're gonna be running, you know Windows 10

768
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:50,340
well, then you're exploited at the operating system level, so it's right so it's

769
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:54,380
hmm, so the for us we look at it as

770
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,860
The game of security is a game of depth

771
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:05,560
And so we want to have all of our applications running free software the entire operating system itself the kernel

772
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:11,660
not running any binaries for wireless or for GPU and then of course the bootloader being freed and then the

773
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:14,620
firmware at the lowest level being freed so

774
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:19,180
And obviously the more these documents get leaked. It just really

775
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,340
It seems to me Todd like it's such a

776
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:29,760
Herculean effort to actually do this that by the time you get to completely done

777
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:35,400
there's there's the real honest potential that the market could shift out from underneath you and like

778
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:40,020
AMD's PSP system the system that you know a lot of people are talking about now that risins getting more attention

779
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:45,700
could all of a sudden start showing up in a lot of laptops and now the market demand might start leaning that direction right as

780
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:49,100
We finally get this problem checked off. Is it do you see what I'm saying?

781
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:55,300
Like it feels like as long as we're finding this uphill battle. It's we might never really be on time with the market demand

782
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,300
Do you think it's possible?

783
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:01,980
So I absolutely think it's possible and of course with AMD right now. It's a lot of potential

784
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:07,720
But we're not at the point where even if they were to say tomorrow. Yeah, well, let's go ahead and release this

785
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:11,900
You're talking about 2018 by the time they actually have something that's you know into a product

786
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:14,780
Yeah, and and I also think feel like right now

787
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:20,980
It's a lot more talk than it is actual product and the reason is because now is the time where they can talk about it

788
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,780
And have the you know, the theories start, you know spewing around and at the end of the day

789
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:30,180
It's going to be a business decision and you know and where in their triage list is it going to be to release the source

790
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:34,420
Code for the a Giza binary, right? It's going to be it's going to be way down their triage list

791
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:39,200
You know, but we but we're still we're pushing for AMD to to release it

792
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:43,420
And as well as pushing with Intel to say we want an emulous design

793
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:49,640
The you know the cryptographic bond and the goal for a lot of these corporations to you know

794
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,620
Really lock up a lot that you can start to see

795
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:56,680
especially with the CIA vault 7 release that

796
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:02,060
It's clear that at least the CIA as well as the tools that they were using

797
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:05,820
That they have the philosophy right if you were to ask me

798
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:12,260
Hey, you know, I want to I want to hack all the encrypted communication services on Android phones

799
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,460
How should I do that?

800
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:19,540
I would say go a level lower than the application right target the operating system and you own everything above it or the base

801
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:21,020
man goes more

802
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:23,020
Yeah, so the same way goes for

803
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:28,300
Management engine or obviously phones which with the baseband which were we're working on

804
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:31,940
We actually have all of our hardware specification ready for manufacturing a phone

805
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:37,180
That'll come out in 2018. So these are all things that that we're really concerned about

806
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:43,540
But to answer your question about you know, where's the market demand? Is it going to shift from underneath us?

807
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:46,380
I think where everything is trending right now is

808
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:51,900
That digital rights for users are getting stripped privacy is getting worse

809
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:55,220
and and the

810
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:03,900
Those who want to have access to your data or your devices is growing in number. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think it's a market

811
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,940
I think it's a market that's gonna just get and more and more leaks

812
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:09,900
They're just gonna keep coming out Joe you had a question about working with Intel. Go ahead

813
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:19,340
Yes, so Todd when you originally launched your crowdfunding campaign and everything you were very positive and very optimistic about working with Intel

814
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,340
and trying to get the

815
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:23,620
You know the various binaries freed

816
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:27,820
Presumably you've come up against quite a lot of walls with Intel

817
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,780
You know, I just wanted to ask, you know, is your optimism still there?

818
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:38,260
I mean you've talked about what you want to happen. But I mean what you realistically think can happen and that's really what I'm getting at

819
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,420
here sure, that's a great question, so

820
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:46,080
One of the great things about buying product from Intel is that we're cutting checks to Intel

821
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:50,340
And so therefore we have account managers and we have therefore dollar leverage now

822
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:53,040
Our dollar leverage is obviously a whole lot smaller than Google

823
01:00:53,460 --> 01:01:01,480
but the as we grow then our dollar leverage starts to increase where we can start making demands to Intel and they'll start to

824
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:07,540
Actually listen, so we have submitted, you know a petition. We've talked with Intel about you know, creating an MULS design

825
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:14,680
Actually, that's they came up with the name from us discussing it that there wasn't anybody talking with Intel about having an MULS design

826
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:22,780
So as an example Google once they had core boot running then they were perfectly fine with getting using the MRC bin that they

827
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,860
used from Intel's FSP binary, so

828
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:34,100
Google at that point was, you know, content with core boot running even though they're using that binary and we're just

829
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:36,100
digging levels deeper, so

830
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,660
for us we're looking at

831
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:42,660
Having our solution in parallel

832
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:45,060
There's actually three parallel paths

833
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:52,060
The first is communicating to Intel our intent and what we want and then they in turn actually share documentation

834
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:57,660
You know BIOS writing documentation so that we can start to find

835
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:03,940
Oh, you know, maybe there is something actually within the existing documentation that nobody's been able to really exploit

836
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:10,460
Such an example as the being able to disable the management engine from NVRAM

837
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,180
fuses on the CPU so those are

838
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:18,060
Some things that Intel is helping with

839
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:23,260
Oh, so the fusing tip came from Intel's documentation?

840
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:30,260
That's correct. Oh, okay. Yes. So that's one where by having an account manager and having access to

841
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:34,860
Documentation allows us to have more knowledge than let's say just you know

842
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:38,500
Someone else just trying to you know, plunk away and hack or reverse engineer

843
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:44,380
Yeah, try to trigger things out that way. So and their their documentation Intel's documentation is

844
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:46,980
immense, right so

845
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:51,540
So we have a lot that we can end up doing that way. That's the first Avenue

846
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:57,420
That's basically working with Intel saying hey, you know, you're not the enemy right? We we want to continue to use your hardware

847
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,700
We want to purchase from you

848
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:07,220
But these are the goals that we want then the second option is you know that that we by using the documentation?

849
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:13,760
Find our own way to you know, either modify code or disable the ME

850
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:20,860
one of the nice things here is that since it's not actually hostile towards Intel because we're not trying to reverse engineer and release like

851
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:26,540
A management injury and replacement, right? What we're trying to do is just not use it period so that's

852
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:30,700
Not a hostile relationship with Intel to go down that path

853
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:34,620
And then the third path of course is is looking at alternatives, right?

854
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:39,500
What do we end up wanting to use AMD or do we want to actually scrap it and go to something?

855
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:46,660
It's really low-powered. So with AMD's talk that ends up helping us with the leverage where we could possibly switch to AMD or

856
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:51,220
continue to talk with Intel about you know about switching so

857
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:58,260
So I am very optimistic because you know, I get to read through the documentation on you know

858
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:03,940
The me design for BIOS writing guide. It's a you know, 192 page document

859
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:12,040
So Intel has very deep knowledge and and documentation on on areas that you'd be really surprised about so

860
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:19,340
So that to answer your question is that Intel is I'm very optimistic because Intel has been helpful

861
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:23,460
In providing documentation and the long-term game

862
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:29,380
It might very well be that they don't put out an ME list design and we end up finding it something ourselves through their documentation

863
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:36,020
Or maybe in you know in a much later version that they say that there is a market demand for that and then they then

864
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:42,540
They offer that up. So I guess Todd. Here's what I here's here's the pessimist in me because I see it almost feels like two

865
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:43,540
scenarios

866
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:45,540
scenario one is a

867
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,300
triumphant

868
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:50,780
Arrival at some solution that

869
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:58,500
Essentially gives people the ability to use Libre boot to bypass and disable Intel management engine and and everybody's happy less blobs

870
01:04:58,500 --> 01:04:59,900
Everybody's happy

871
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:05,500
but all of that work will just quickly be snapped up by vendors like system 76 and intro where and so

872
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:10,180
There won't be a there won't be a market advantage that lasts very long. So that's scenario one

873
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:15,820
Oh scenario two though, but scenario two would be that Intel just decides to do this and then everybody gets it and

874
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:22,380
Market advantages also lost there. So what's the what's the upside for purism long-term here, right?

875
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:25,100
So there's a couple pieces. So first of all, you have to be running core boot

876
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:30,660
So if your machines not ported to core boot, then you're then you have to do that port

877
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:37,300
So it's not like by us disabling the ME. Okay, and it's right that you still have that would be within the range of other

878
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:42,740
OEMs or especially those that are getting more serious about their own manufacturing. It seems like they could be within their capability

879
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:47,260
Oh, yeah, absolutely. They would just need to say I'm gonna invest and actually have that ported. So that's that's step one

880
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:51,500
But of course right now you're there. There isn't it. Everybody's using

881
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:57,620
EFI or UFI except except Chromebooks, right? So or you know

882
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:01,700
Pre 2008 machines right lever boot based machines. Yeah

883
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:08,060
So so that is obviously an advantage that we would end up having over others is that we're investing in that space

884
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:15,000
To have a really depth of credibility on the security side. That's true. Yeah, so okay then so that's you know point one. So but

885
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,920
Yes of system 76 or or even you know, let's say Dell decided. Hey, you know what?

886
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:26,760
We we don't like all these threats coming in from vault 7 where all of our machines are gutted because it's an EFI threat

887
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:34,400
That they could end up putting core boot on at that point then they would still be using the default installs from Intel

888
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:40,580
Then they would have to actually go through the fuses that we have and of course we'll publish what you know fuses word targeting

889
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,580
Because it actually helps users so

890
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:45,540
So then it would basically they'll be paying playing catch-up

891
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:52,100
But the question is are they gonna want to have the same depth of credibility that we have if they're installing Windows the depth of

892
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:55,340
Credibility is completely right. Yeah, it seems like you yeah

893
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:57,940
I guess your point there is by by dredging this journey

894
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:02,860
you'll establish the purism brand as sort of being like that not only one of the first on the scene with it, but also

895
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:07,140
Having expertise with it, which is obviously going to give it some credibility

896
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:09,420
So I I guess I guess that is a good point

897
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:14,300
But what about if Intel just decides to play ball? Do you feel like? That's still a net win for purism

898
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:19,180
I do and the reason is because then it actually allows the users to control it

899
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:23,660
Which would be that the ME is going to be on by default. That's just how it's going to be so

900
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:30,820
You know a manufacturer or reseller who has access to being able to fuse the CPU

901
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:38,380
Would be able to so our proposal to Intel is actually to opt to add one of the fuses that we have

902
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:43,940
One of the fuses that we get as a manufacturer because we get the CPUs in manufacturing mode

903
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:48,100
So then we have the capabilities to fuse the CPU and right now

904
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:53,500
we have 14 fuses that we can fuse and I were saying make a 15th fuse that allows us to actually disable the ME and

905
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:58,220
You can ship it where they'll be you know that it can be fused by default

906
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:05,620
But we can we can achieve it'll have the ME by default and then we can fuse the CPU during the fabrication process

907
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:11,140
To disable the ME and then that that's all we need so in that case then you know it it

908
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:13,660
Accomplishes a few things the first is that

909
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:17,140
We would then have a CPU that from Intel

910
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:23,220
It's Intel supported that would allow us to be able to disable at the lowest level a core that we don't need

911
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:28,940
The second piece is then it doesn't change that for any of their other

912
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:37,620
Buyers right because they would they would get what they had to be in and then they would likely would not be all that

913
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:42,340
Encouraged or motivated to make a change like going back to Lenovo or somebody because they are even pushing this if they were

914
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:46,520
Yeah, that's exactly right. Okay. That's a that makes sense all right Wow okay?

915
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:51,700
Well, I'm glad you guys are working on this because you know I go back going back to wimpy

916
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:57,460
I imagine wimpy your goal here is to have something that's sort of a unique fully open source stacked machine, right?

917
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:02,500
Are you gonna put like triskel on this thing, or what's what's your plan wimpy? It was shipped with triskel seven oh?

918
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:08,540
Really? Yeah, yeah, are you gonna get it or is this a mate test machine like what's going on here wimpy?

919
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:14,220
What's your what's your and why why this machine? It's it's a curiosity okay?

920
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:18,820
You know I as we said earlier. You know there's some Bitcoin

921
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:20,980
value at the moment

922
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:24,740
there are some unusual items floating around and this was one of them and

923
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:30,420
I was interested to have one of these and actually have a poke around with it and that yeah retrofitting

924
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:34,900
You know the the core boot Libre boot on these devices is not is non-trivial

925
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:39,420
Oh, so I wanted to have a play and see what it can do and what it's doing the first thing

926
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:44,740
I've noticed boots very fast that that initialization piece is I bet shockingly quick

927
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:51,540
It makes that old machine seem quite pokey. I've heard that yeah, I've heard that I've had the same curiosity as you

928
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:54,100
and so is this

929
01:09:54,100 --> 01:10:00,100
Is that is the end goal here to experiment with just the just the process?

930
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:08,460
Yeah, it's just it's just another interesting bit of technology. I'd like to learn more about and I've had a helping hand in that

931
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:10,460
I haven't had to

932
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:18,700
Wrestle the laptop open and put it under my rather dodgy soldering skills somebody else has done that for me is an SSD

933
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:24,660
Yeah, so it's been refurbished. So they they've fitted it with a qualcomm atheros

934
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:28,340
wireless end card and a Samsung

935
01:10:29,380 --> 01:10:34,540
850 256 gig and it's got eight make eight gigs of RAM in it as well. So it's like a full

936
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:45,260
Yeah, yeah, actually better not your laptop where's I could yeah, I bet you the performance is not that bad

937
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:48,980
It's actually very decent. It's actually very decent. Yeah, and I've got a I've got a

938
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:51,940
An X to a one which I've had for a while

939
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:56,860
So I I know how to compare the performance, you know, because the tour ones a little bit newer

940
01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:58,740
And yeah

941
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:05,900
The thing that surprised me because it's obviously got the SSD in it is just how quick the machine comes on and actually starts

942
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,900
Booting so it comes up fast

943
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:13,300
But it's just not having to sit around and wait around for the BIOS and EFI to happen

944
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,300
It's very quick

945
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:18,060
But it's still a core to do isn't it?

946
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:19,740
Yeah, yeah

947
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:20,860
I mean I've not done much with it

948
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:25,820
Like I say, I've literally turned it on being impressed by the boot speed and done the updates on the box

949
01:11:25,820 --> 01:11:27,820
I've not actually tried to use it for anything

950
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:34,780
Serious. Yeah, I'll get to that. Huh? I kind of want to check back in if I remember I won't be here next week

951
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:39,300
Oh, I won't be yeah, so I'm gonna be on the road next week. I think we're gonna I don't know who's gonna guest

952
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:42,260
I haven't we get to find out. Yeah, I so much going on

953
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:46,540
I haven't it might just be West so everybody show up in the Mamba room. Everybody everybody have a lot of fun

954
01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:47,940
However, I do have this computer set up

955
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:51,300
So if we do have a guest they'll be able to call in and they'll be able to talk to mom

956
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,620
We'll be able to hear them. So we'll see we'll see what happens

957
01:11:53,620 --> 01:11:56,780
We may have a surprise guest host next week, but maybe in a couple weeks

958
01:11:56,780 --> 01:12:00,300
I'll check in wimpy and see what you think. I think that I think I think

959
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:04,780
I think we may talk about it on the Ubuntu podcast. So you can

960
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:12,140
Surprise go find wimpy over there surprise and also poppies on there so you can find poppy also, but he's not here today

961
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:16,020
Oh, yeah, the Ubuntu podcast a one of the one of the podcast

962
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:20,140
I am subscribed to you can also Joe Joe is on Linux late-night Linux

963
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:22,820
I almost call the Linux after dark again, because I keep thinking the screensaver

964
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:28,300
I know I'm sorry. I'm sorry and that's a great show too. So go subscribe to that as well

965
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:32,500
It turns out it turns out despite what might be going on with those guys over at Linux action

966
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:37,020
She can't trust him. Don't trust those guys. The unplugged show is sticking around here. So what will be here?

967
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:41,020
I might not be here, but we'll all be next week. It's a community. That's what makes it

968
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:46,620
You know, I thought about trying to join in mumble, but I was looking at the timing for next week. Yeah, and I

969
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:50,500
Just you'll be driving like a bad man. I think it's gonna be like peak driving

970
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:56,060
I think it's gonna be like an 11-hour day for me driving. Well Dylan's going along right just pop him up at the wheel

971
01:12:56,060 --> 01:13:01,860
Yeah, well Hadid offered like oh I could drive for a bit. Oh, yeah, you know the thing is it's not just driving

972
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:05,620
It's like then you don't know where you're gonna be reception wise either because you're moving so much

973
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:07,900
So I just feel like I would be a board in the past

974
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:13,800
I'm sorry from a car man. That would be unbelievable, wouldn't it? Yeah, somebody no never that would never happen Joe

975
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:18,300
That would never happen. That's I'm heard of somebody joins from a car never crazy. Yeah

976
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:21,740
Hey, by the way mumbles on Android, so we'll see what happens

977
01:13:21,740 --> 01:13:26,000
But I think well something something something will happen next week. Just got to tune and find out

978
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,180
We'll keep it fresh there will be sure there will be a show as long as these guys can figure out how to turn on

979
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:32,380
The studio which I think you've got I think you got it

980
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:37,420
I just stroked the beard the magic beard and everything comes up when I asked the beard about he said yeah

981
01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:41,460
I mean, I think so. I mean the show might just be late. Yeah

982
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:48,620
That's fine, I suppose that really is fine

983
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:51,820
You tune in over JB live TV and you don't have to worry about it

984
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:55,260
You just get to watch the show go down and I know it won't be here to bail you guys out

985
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:58,080
Yeah, cuz he's gonna be flying right? Yeah, we're gonna be in Tejas

986
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:03,980
Meeting up with Dell. I wonder if they'll have any XPS 15s in the lab that I can check out go fine

987
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:07,340
If you see one of the hallway just snag it. Yeah, man. Totally. All right

988
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:10,000
Well that does bring us to the end of this week's episode of the unplugged program

989
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,180
Thank you for joining us. You can go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar to get our live time in your local

990
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:17,820
time of neck of the woods thing

991
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,860
Time zone thing also Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact for feedback

992
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:26,500
Linux action show at our reddit comm for potential updates and projects

993
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:30,480
Yeah, join us live in the mumble room to get information in our chat room. See you next week

994
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:34,240
Well, they will I'm out of here

995
01:14:34,240 --> 01:15:04,040
See you guys

996
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:08,340
And we canonical a lesson

997
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:24,180
Bob it up that Bob it up. Alright, so JB titles calm. Let's go do our title thing now

998
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:28,900
I know that Nick lob who I almost want to call Nick Bob in the show had a question

999
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,920
Regarding the Intel management engine probably for Todd. So Nick go ahead

1000
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,440
Are you I saw you asking you get first go?

1001
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,120
Hello

1002
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:41,360
Thoughts left actually just a second ago. Oh

1003
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,260
He did. Oh, was it for him? Okay. Well, thanks Todd for joining us. Goodbye

1004
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:50,240
Maybe it was our sick tunes drove them away

1005
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:56,000
Jail that whale. What's that a reference to? Oh the docker stuff. That's pretty good. That's pretty good

1006
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,160
Boot free or die trying that was my suggestion

1007
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:01,160
Like it

1008
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:12,580
Who should I have a guest co-host next week, who should I ask because obviously I can't make them do it, right? Who should I invite?

1009
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,280
Takes we won't put my lap on right now

1010
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:29,800
Chase just to throw it as a wild card. I feel like I feel like I could ask Joe

1011
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,720
But I feel like it's a lot asking that's a lot of Joe

1012
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,720
I mean, that's a lot asking a lot of Joe. But yeah, that would be good

1013
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,200
That would be good for people to get to meet Joe. That's a good mix it up. Have my core

1014
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,920
I'd have to not be in my car, but I could work something out

1015
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,080
Yeah, that we don't want to impose too much on you. So I have Skype set up here and Joe could call it

1016
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,080
All right. I like this Joe

1017
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:53,960
The bus I'm gonna go with it Joe if you're down for it boy that shirt so that solves my problem right there and I

1018
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:56,880
Actually probably is a good chance for the JB honest to get to meet you. Yeah

1019
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:04,720
Digital ocean is like and honestly, there you go. Yeah, that helps

1020
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:10,680
I heard the read in the plug for the affiliate in late night Linux in it. Yeah, it's legit

1021
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,160
All right, awesome, well, that's awesome Joe, thank you

1022
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:20,200
Alright, so I'll just you can just be able to Skype to Jupiter broadcasting it in West

1023
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,720
You'll be able to just should I think I'll set it to automatically login

1024
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:32,080
Cool well, that's awesome. Thank you guys. Well, that's that's excellent and wimpy. I'm glad I'm officially Joe's agent now. Yeah, right

1025
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,320
financial attractions

1026
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,320
transactions

1027
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,800
Whoa, there's Skype there's Skype, you know, I'm gonna do I'm gonna log into Skype

1028
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:46,840
I'm gonna turn off all of the notifications for you right now West. I'm gonna hook you up with those. Yeah, I hate those so much

1029
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:50,400
And wimpy I owe you a beer or two. That's for sure

1030
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,640
But yeah beers only redeemable at Linux fest Northwest

1031
01:17:54,640 --> 01:18:10,280
I'm gonna pull my finger out and sort my travel out this weekend at a boy. I'll be in touch
