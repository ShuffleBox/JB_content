1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,460
I have discovered a web based virtual machine x86 virtualization in your browser.

2
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:20,800
It's recompiling x86 to web assembly on the fly and you can spin up distros and of course

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,360
like you just heard Windows 98 in the web browser.

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,580
It's a proof of concept but it's kind of incredible.

5
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,360
You hipster, I'm running Windows 3.1 over here playing some solitaire.

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
Oh yeah?

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,100
Oh, I gotta try that too.

8
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,100
That's pretty great.

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,080
It boots up pretty quick as well.

10
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,520
Taking a look at the GitHub, looks like there's even some rust involved here, Chris.

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,840
But I do have one bit of bad news.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,440
No, Plan 9 doesn't work.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,000
We'll put a link in the show notes.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Oh hey friends, welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
My name is Chris.

16
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,880
My name is Wes.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,840
This episode is brought to you by the all new Cloud Guru.

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,000
They are the leader in cloud for Linux and other modern tech skills.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,560
They have hundreds of courses, thousands of hands on labs.

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,120
So get certified, get hired and get learning at a cloudguru.com.

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:22,120
All right, so this week there's been something that I've been sitting with for a couple of

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
weeks.

23
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,600
Some old friends of mine of longtime Linux users have taken to the web to pronounce that

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,640
Linux is boring.

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,160
Linux isn't going anywhere.

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,840
Maybe you saw some of those posts recently.

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,680
And the funny thing is, I think anybody who's been around for a while, we've seen this commentary

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,920
from time to time, almost on a yearly basis.

29
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,840
It's definitely as long as I've been in the Linux community, I've seen this.

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,820
And I've never really agreed with the sentiment.

31
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:54,040
I've always felt like maybe they were just sort of settling down into Linux and they

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
were getting bored.

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,500
But Linux itself, I think the desktop's been getting more interesting than ever recently.

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,680
If you keep reading all the announcements and the mailing lists and you follow developers

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,400
and you talk to people, you see there's new debates raging, there's new concepts being

36
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
tried.

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,760
And I think when you keep up with that stuff, you learn that that stuff is still going somewhere.

38
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
It's not done.

39
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,760
And maybe because the desktop actually works for getting work done doesn't mean it's boring.

40
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,220
Is that what you're saying, Chris?

41
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,220
That's what I'm saying.

42
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,400
And I think there's some new stuff that's just, some of it just weeks away, it's going

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,780
to make Linux better than ever.

44
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,120
And so your unplugged program today is going to go through some of this, specifically through

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,940
the lens of Fedora 34.

46
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:40,560
Because what I see in Fedora 34 right now, which is in development, I see there the future

47
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,740
of the Linux desktop.

48
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,500
And even if you're not, don't worry, even if you're not a Fedora user or even a GNOME

49
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:52,980
Shell user, I think some of what's landing in 34 is going to find its way into every

50
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,460
Linux distro in the future.

51
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,260
So coming up on the show today, we're going to break down some of those features and tell

52
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,660
you the ones that we think are the most exciting in particular.

53
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,540
This is one of those topics where we have been geeking out and realized we could probably

54
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,540
make a show out of this.

55
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,900
Yeah, I mean, as long as we're re-imaging everything with Fedora and playing with the

56
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,460
latest unreleased GNOME, we better talk about it.

57
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,560
So a lot of this stuff is coming together for Fedora.

58
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,920
It's a lot of work.

59
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,380
Version 33 was great.

60
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,380
It was exciting.

61
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,820
You know, version 33 we talked a lot about because really was bringing ButterFS to the

62
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,860
workstation versions of Fedora.

63
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,420
So we talked a lot about that before, but today we're going to talk about what's coming

64
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,340
not just to 34, but to all the distributions.

65
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,740
So to help us break through that, to help us chew it all and analyze it all, we're going

66
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,140
to bring in a team of experts.

67
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,020
We're going to bring in our virtual lug.

68
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,620
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

69
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,620
Hello, Chris.

70
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,620
Good evening.

71
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,620
Hello.

72
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,620
Namaskara.

73
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,620
Hello.

74
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,620
Hello, everyone.

75
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,620
It's exciting times ahead.

76
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,580
I don't know if any of you have seen some of the sentiments posted online recently that

77
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,020
things are getting a little boring and that GNOME 40 doesn't do anything to change that.

78
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:06,820
I just completely disagree, and I think we have some very exciting times ahead of us.

79
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,500
I want to say, although I feel like people think I'm exaggerating, but I want to say

80
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,880
potentially the most exciting times we've had on the Linux desktop in general.

81
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,020
I know it's a big statement, but it really feels like we are on the precipice of several

82
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,780
technologies coming together.

83
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,780
It's peak Linux desktop, everybody.

84
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,940
So let's talk about some of this groundwork.

85
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,120
So Fedora 34 is in development right now.

86
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,060
It's supposed to be released towards the end of April.

87
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,300
It will represent the culmination of several important efforts that have been developing

88
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,300
over the years, and we'll talk about some of those.

89
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,620
And that's why I say when you look at 34, you kind of see where the future of desktop

90
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,760
Linux is going, even if you don't run GNOME or Fedora.

91
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,860
And I think you'll find something interesting in all of this.

92
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,060
Essentially, this stuff lands here first in Fedora often and then makes its way out.

93
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,980
And there's an ecosystem effect we're going to talk about as well.

94
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,000
And as he has been known to do, senior manager for desktop at Red Hat Christian Schaller wrote

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,300
a detailed blog post about what to look forward to in Fedora Workstation 34, which will have

96
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,740
the first take at a lot of these goodies.

97
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,060
We'll have the full post in the notes if you're curious, and it's definitely worth going through

98
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,740
if you're a Fedora user or a GNOME user or just interested in the future of the desktop.

99
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,260
But we're also going to break down a few things that we think will have the biggest long term

100
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,140
impact on desktop Linux.

101
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,780
Yeah, and I think the number one with a bullet is Wayland.

102
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,680
We've been talking about it for years.

103
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:43,420
And Wayland is production ready for more use cases than not now in Fedora 34 and for other

104
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,180
distributions here in the future.

105
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,500
It took a little while to get there.

106
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,860
Of course, you had to get accelerated ExWayland support working.

107
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,220
It took partnering up with Nvidia to get them to start working on a driver that works with

108
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,660
Wayland, which isn't complete yet.

109
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,440
It took figuring out ways to share screen and do things securely.

110
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,780
There's a lot of engineering work that went into make Wayland actually adoptable by the

111
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,220
wider community.

112
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:12,000
Of course, some of that work was in ExWayland, including some work going on for headless

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,100
display support, which is kind of a critical feature for people who want to run a desktop

114
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,460
instance on a server in the cloud or do some fancy VNC or RDP tasks.

115
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,000
And I think it's exactly that area where that's what we mean with Wayland and that ecosystem

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,420
getting to production ready is that some of those less common or more advanced use cases,

117
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,140
those are finally getting ironed out.

118
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,560
And it required some plumbing be developed to make it all possible.

119
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,420
And that's where Pipewire came together that makes doing things like packaging applications

120
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,020
securely with Flatpak possible while also enabling video and screen sharing on Wayland.

121
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,160
And then bridging the gap between the different audio subsystems too now.

122
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,580
So Pipewire, it's another big ticket item that is shipping in Fedora Workstation 34.

123
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,080
Most of you know it's an engine to handle video streams and it became also an engine

124
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,240
to deal with audio.

125
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,340
In Workstation 34, the plan is for Pipewire to take over that audio role.

126
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,780
That has been kind of more in development phase.

127
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,940
It is something Wes and I have been playing with and I've had a lot of good experiences

128
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,260
so far with it.

129
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,200
Pipewire, it does audio management more like you would be used to using a tool on the Mac

130
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,960
like Audio Hijack Pro.

131
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,900
It's more of the Mac style, but still compatible with Pulse and jack audio and simpler in a

132
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,100
lot of ways.

133
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,700
And it's been seamless in my testing.

134
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,340
What do you mean by Mac style?

135
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:40,060
I think I agree, but for folks who maybe don't ever run a Mac, what does Mac style mean?

136
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,500
So you'd actually probably be better at explaining it.

137
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,820
So it's like the opposite of the way you connect devices in jack, right?

138
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,260
In Pipewire, they're almost on by default, you know what I'm saying?

139
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:56,060
Yeah, I guess once you're using some of the jack tooling that lets you do audio routing,

140
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,560
you can see everything on your system, whether the client is using jack or the client is

141
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,100
using Pulse audio.

142
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:06,660
It's all integrated and you can connect arbitrary applications together without those apps having

143
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,820
to opt into the system.

144
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,780
Whereas right now, you kind of have to be using jack or do some complicated tricks with

145
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,220
Pulse audio bridges.

146
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,620
And either way, it's not intuitive.

147
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,120
And additionally, on top of that, Wes, it makes it just really simpler from just the

148
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,860
way that I think users expect things to work.

149
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,780
Like you launch, say, VLC, VLC shows up in one of these tools and you can just connect

150
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,020
audio in and out the way you would expect to be able to just connect blocks and you're

151
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,580
using established jack tools to do it.

152
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,460
It's really cool how they've, they kind of managed to re-engineer this section of Linux,

153
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,420
but keep it in a way that is compatible with the existing tools.

154
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:47,540
And so with the approach they've taken and it's really down to how they've interacted

155
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,160
with the community, it's come down to how they've managed people and how they've managed

156
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,040
these different, I guess you could call them stakeholders.

157
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,780
They've gotten people excited and participating in the process.

158
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,860
And so even commercial vendors are testing for pipeline compatibility now.

159
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,100
There's been, they've created a momentum because they've worked with people.

160
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,420
It hasn't been hostile, it's been collaborative.

161
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:17,060
And so it's moving really rapidly and it's going to debut in 34, but I would think by

162
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,680
this time next year, distros will be shipping it, just all of them.

163
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,760
It's kind of fascinating.

164
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,540
It's sort of a slow play, right?

165
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,620
It's tough to reintroduce a new sound system, take things over on the Linux desktop.

166
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,860
I mean, look at how difficult pulse audio was and it's kind of still a little controversial,

167
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,860
right?

168
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,780
I mean, we've all got feelings about pulse, but Pipewire seems to be doing it the right

169
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,460
way, getting compatibility in place.

170
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,460
Now of course, a lot of this stuff is still very much a work in progress.

171
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,460
And if you find applications that use some of the niche features of say, pulse audio

172
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,500
or Jack, okay, maybe you run into some edge cases where it doesn't work just yet.

173
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:00,200
But as those get ironed out, I mean, Pipewire seems to be rock solid at the foundations.

174
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,780
That's what's so impressive is even with all the warnings about like, hey, this is new.

175
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,740
Hey, we're just trying it out.

176
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,820
We've been kind of abusing it, Chris, and it just keeps working.

177
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,180
Let's fast forward to Flatpaks, Wes, because it kind of all stacks.

178
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:20,100
You've got Wayland and then Pipewire is a sort of a necessary enabling technology for

179
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,300
the Wayland reality.

180
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,220
And then Flatpaks, they also play a role with the way their security model works.

181
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,620
And Pipewire enables some functionality there as well.

182
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,500
They're all kind of connected together.

183
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,500
And there's been a lot of work behind the scenes for the last year to try to shore up

184
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,260
the RHEL and Fedora infrastructure for Flatpaks and the overall experience.

185
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,500
And Christian writes about how they're moving forward to eventually make Flatpaks the primary

186
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,220
packaging format that Fedora users consume.

187
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,740
I want to come back to that in a moment.

188
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:59,560
But in that effort, they're making a lot of things simpler and easier for maintainers.

189
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,560
And they're working on introducing a really solid incremental update method for Flatpaks,

190
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,340
like you see on Flat Hub, that makes them much faster and quicker to update.

191
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,820
And that, I think, is also going to have wide-ranging benefits.

192
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,460
That Flatpak work they're doing here for the future of Fedora is going to improve the Flatpak

193
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,460
situation for distributions like elementary OS eventually.

194
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,460
Boy, yeah.

195
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,580
I think getting performance right, making a really solid user experience, if you're

196
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:32,580
going to become the next standard of packaging, kind of the low bar right there, right?

197
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,580
All right.

198
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,580
But hold up.

199
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,140
Red alert here on, again, I know I mentioned this on the show once before, but are we just

200
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:44,860
all of a sudden comfortable with the idea that we're going to replace the native packages

201
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,820
on the system and start shipping desktop-level applications as Flatpaks?

202
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,380
Because I seem to recall it was a pretty big issue when the idea was that it might be snaps

203
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,660
on Ubuntu.

204
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,900
So I'm curious where the mumble room stands on this one and why I feel like I'm not seeing

205
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,740
the outcry with Flatpak.

206
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,260
Anybody have thoughts on that?

207
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,260
Yeah.

208
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,900
I think one of the reasons why we tend to see, why we're seeing a little bit of a different

209
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:15,860
attitude here is that the Flatpak ecosystem generally puts the user in control of their

210
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:23,800
workflows and their sources and their management of the software, which I think the broader

211
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:31,300
Linux community prefers over admittedly the simpler user experience, the more continually

212
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,580
updated but slightly out of control model that the snaps offered.

213
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:42,320
And on top of that, there was a lot of specific outreach done in the Flatpak ecosystem to

214
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,260
make sure the technologies that were being leveraged to do sandboxing and things like

215
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,260
that were not distro specific.

216
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:56,140
And that was a misstep that Canonical did early on with Snap where it required Ubuntu

217
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,300
app armor as opposed to the standard app armor that ships in the Linux kernel for all the

218
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,620
other distributions.

219
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,060
That is something I hear a lot.

220
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,020
And again, not every distribution ships a mandatory access control system.

221
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:13,060
A lot of them basically flat out hate mandatory access control systems despite the fact that

222
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,580
they're very valuable.

223
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:21,820
And so if your desktop application sandbox mechanism hard depends on a mandatory access

224
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:27,660
control system, be it SC Linux app armor or Ubuntu app armor, then you're toast.

225
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,740
It's not going to actually serve that purpose so people feel like you're taking away control

226
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,260
without giving any benefit because for the vast majority of people outside of the Ubuntu

227
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,340
sphere, it's actually worse.

228
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,340
Right.

229
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,260
Actually, I want to let Colonel get in on that point.

230
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,260
Colonel, do you sense that the Snap store plays a role in this?

231
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:50,480
Yeah, I think that there was a certain amount of backlash against snaps because the source

232
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,180
for the snaps is controlled by Canonical.

233
00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:00,840
I think that it was twofold, one, similar to what Conan was saying is that it's controlled

234
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
by one person.

235
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:09,060
But I think there was also a certain amount of with snaps, not invented here in reverse

236
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:15,740
almost where people were lashing out against it because it came from Canonical.

237
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,660
And I don't think that's a fair reason to lash out against them.

238
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,660
It's a reality though.

239
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
Yeah, it's a reality.

240
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,780
And I think that Conan actually summed up a lot of what I was going to say.

241
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,660
I think your point is well made that there is a certain amount of pushback that they

242
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,220
get just simply because it is Canonical.

243
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:37,980
Minimac, so you had a listener in the Luplug join and talk about his full Flatpak lifestyle

244
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,580
where he went all in on Flatpaks and there is a bit of a disadvantage.

245
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,580
There is indeed.

246
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,640
So it was like two or three weeks ago, I don't even remember, all of a sudden he was talking

247
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,420
about the size of his system, only the system, not talking about his private data.

248
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,780
And his system grew to over 30 gigabytes.

249
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,780
And I was like, what?

250
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,300
I never had a system like that.

251
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,940
And then he told us that he was a heavy Flatpak user.

252
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,020
So his system grew and grew and grew.

253
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:06,320
So I'm not really a fan to replace the normal package system by that because these Flatpaks

254
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,920
or snaps or two, they come with a lot of data and you don't really need it.

255
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,460
If you have a native package manager, you don't need all these Flatpaks, I think.

256
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,460
True.

257
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,500
You really notice that when you're setting things up, just as I was playing with 34,

258
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,860
I did set up, say, SnapD and I was like, oh yeah, right, I got to install the whole Snap

259
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,860
base world.

260
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,180
Yeah, FlatHub is getting really nice too.

261
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,740
Not that the SnapCraft tools aren't nice on their website, but FlatHub has some clear

262
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:42,500
momentum of packaging applications that are appealing to users, much like Snaps did early

263
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,500
on.

264
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,940
Now that seems to have transitioned over there.

265
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,860
And going back to Fedora 34, one of the things they're going to be doing potentially, and

266
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:54,280
I think it is going to happen, is they're going to add FlatHub as a third party repository

267
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,360
if you enable that as an option.

268
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,420
Sort of like, it reminds me of like, it's almost like another RPM fusion now.

269
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,820
It's just the next generation, yeah.

270
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,640
Yeah, and it's looking really good.

271
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,600
But okay, so let's get back to what's coming.

272
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,980
So also one of the things you're going to see land in 34, which will eventually impact

273
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,900
a lot of distributions, but this one's going to trickle out a little slower, is GNOME Shell

274
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,900
40.

275
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,420
Yeah, of course, with the kind of big revamp of the GNOME 3 user interface.

276
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,140
This was a collaborative effort between a lot of the GNOME 3 stakeholders, with Alan

277
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,980
Day representing Red Hat.

278
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,340
But it was also an effort by the GNOME design community to really up their game.

279
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,780
And interestingly, as part of the development process this time around, the GNOME Foundation

280
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:41,140
paid a professional company to do user testing on the proposed changes and some of the alternatives,

281
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,780
which is why we've been talking about it, which feels like already forever, right?

282
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,740
And it hasn't even been released yet.

283
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,980
The thing is, is this, because I think in part, the team was kind of clever calling

284
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,020
it 40.

285
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:00,260
Because what I am seeing, and we're going to have lots of links in the show notes, is

286
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,060
this almost ecosystem effect.

287
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:09,260
That because the GNOME Shell project is going with this big number, all of these other projects

288
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,180
are sort of stepping up, and we'll cover some of them, they're stepping up to get included

289
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,180
in this release.

290
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:20,300
Because it's kind of a major milestone, and that turns out to be a pretty significant

291
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,060
motivator for some free software developers.

292
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,180
And one of the advantages we're having with Fedora, and that's why we're using the lens

293
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:31,340
of Fedora for this episode, is they just don't do a lot of tweaking to the GNOME user interface.

294
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,900
Which means what you get in 34 is essentially what the main new GNOME experience is, and

295
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,220
that's what we wanted to get hands-on with.

296
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,580
Yeah, just a nice upstream snapshot.

297
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,580
Yeah.

298
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,220
And you know, there was some discussion, like Wes said earlier on the show, specifically

299
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,860
around the multi-monitor stuff, but I think we made some fair points there.

300
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:54,680
And Christian actually says that some early versions did lead to long-term fans of how

301
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,740
multi-monitor support worked in GNOME 3 to be concerned.

302
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,900
Carl, I think he just called you old there.

303
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,860
That is definitely a reference to the conversation we had on the show.

304
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,860
But he said, be assured that multi-monitor is a critical use case, in our opinion, and

305
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,180
something we've been looking at and will keep improving.

306
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:17,420
Another area that's coming that's going to matter a lot is input is going into its own

307
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,020
thread now in GNOME 40.

308
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,260
And that means that you're going to get a smoother input experience with your mouse

309
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,540
and your keyboard when the system is under load.

310
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,180
So you're not going to get mouse stall, which I have complained about before on Wayland.

311
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,060
That's been cleaned up as well.

312
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,460
That stuff will land for all of you eventually.

313
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:43,360
But this rollout of 40 has pushed these app developers and even library developers forward.

314
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,700
You're seeing projects like Lib Handy get a big release for 40.

315
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,940
Mudder has gotten major improvements for 40.

316
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,340
Epiphany has a whole new really, really beautiful tab system that I think should go everywhere

317
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,780
in GNOME Shell that they're rolling out.

318
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,300
And a lot more than I can list are just getting things ready for GNOME 40.

319
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:08,700
So even if your distro won't ship the shell itself, the GTK ecosystem is getting a nice

320
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,040
improvement here.

321
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,120
A lot of these apps are getting ready for GTK 4 as well.

322
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,020
And a lot of them in their blog posts, well, not a lot, but some of them in their blog

323
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,620
posts are even committing to GTK 4 and GNOME 41.

324
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,340
There seems to be a lot of momentum there right now.

325
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:32,060
I will have links to one, two, three, four, five, six different examples of projects that

326
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:39,260
are shoring things up for GNOME 40, including, I'm happy to report, OBS Studio on Wayland

327
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,940
using Pipewire packaged up as a Flatpak, which I tried out this morning.

328
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,740
The future is here.

329
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,980
Yeah, it works.

330
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,620
It does only full screen capture right now.

331
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,500
So you can't on Wayland capture a specific window.

332
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,900
But if you had like a second monitor, whatever you put on that second monitor, you could

333
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,940
then capture with OBS.

334
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,340
It works though, using Pipewire.

335
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,340
Yes.

336
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,240
And it's, I mean, like, think about all the plumbing.

337
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,940
Same thing with a lot of these improvements, right?

338
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,700
Like moving the mouse stuff to a separate thread.

339
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,520
Okay, that sounds like, how is this just happening?

340
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,700
Same with capturing, you know, full screen capture here.

341
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,660
But there's been a lot of internals that had to get reworked, thought out, designed, carefully

342
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,140
constructed and integrated together to make that happen.

343
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,120
That is for sure, Mr. Payne, and it's really cool to see it all coming together.

344
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,900
So what we decided to do, though, is instead of just read about it, we wanted to get hands

345
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,900
on with it.

346
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:33,840
We wanted to try some of this stuff and walk away with some notes for you and give you

347
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,720
some hands on experience and where things are at.

348
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,220
And we'll do all of that in just a moment.

349
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,260
lino.com slash unplugged.

350
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:47,160
Go there to get $100 for 60 days on a new account.

351
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,380
And of course, you support the show, but $100 means you can really try out all the stuff

352
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,680
we talk about.

353
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:57,100
Whenever you hear us have any kind of like project that we've set up on the show for

354
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,960
like a segment or to have the chat room pound on, we always deploy it on the note because

355
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,860
we know it's going to handle the traffic.

356
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,020
And there's nothing like a load of putting several hundred people on a system all at

357
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,020
once.

358
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,940
But personally, I know it's going to hold up because we've done it over and over again.

359
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,980
Linode's infrastructure is legit.

360
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,920
They've been around forever, so they know how to do it really well.

361
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,580
And I have confidence because they're in this for the love of Linux.

362
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,780
And I don't mean that as just like a cheesy thing to say.

363
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,320
That's why they do this.

364
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,420
That's why they started in 2003.

365
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,460
There's other companies out there that do this, but they do it because they've been

366
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,740
VC funded and they've identified a good market to go after and they have a solid go to market

367
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,340
strategy.

368
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,060
And that's fine.

369
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,820
Linode did it because they love Linux, which is the same reason I'm sitting behind this

370
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:54,620
microphone and it gives me a solid trust in my infrastructure running on Linode servers.

371
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,460
And then I see it in subtle ways when I use their cloud manager or when I interact with

372
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,120
anyone at Linode.

373
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,660
That has been a fun experience just personally.

374
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,660
I see it.

375
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,660
I also see it just through the service itself.

376
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,720
And I love that they have all the different distributions that I might want to play with

377
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,860
because part of why I like Linode is I do experiment with stuff.

378
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,260
It's a good learning platform.

379
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,740
It's a good experimentation platform.

380
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,340
It's a good testing platform.

381
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,180
And obviously, I think it's a good production platform.

382
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,980
But I love that they have Alpine, they have Arch, they have Santos, they have Debian,

383
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,620
they have Fedora, they have OpenSeus, they have the Seuses, they have the Ubuntu's.

384
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,740
They have all of that stuff there and they'll even kind of walk you through custom loading

385
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,860
an image onto a box, which I've actually done.

386
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,740
I've taken essentially a virtual machine image and uploaded it there and got it working.

387
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,940
And it's a few steps, but they walk you through it all.

388
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,660
It's incredible they even let you do that.

389
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,460
And they're independently owned too.

390
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,220
I like that as well because so is Jupiter Broadcasting.

391
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,140
We share that in common.

392
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,320
We've been going now for a long time.

393
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,860
We've really kind of honed in on what we do and that's what we just really focus on and

394
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,940
we try to do the hell out of it.

395
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,140
And we started because we love Linux.

396
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,240
And that is, you know what they call that?

397
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,240
They call that synergy.

398
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,100
And I think a lot of you listening can identify with a lot of those key points too.

399
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,820
So that $100 kind of just takes it over, right, makes it just kind of perfect.

400
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,940
Because then you can really try and experiment with this stuff that I've been talking about

401
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,980
for a while.

402
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,860
And I think you'll learn that it's great for any use case, testing, learning and production.

403
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,460
And they have rigs to match at every single price level.

404
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,300
They're 30% to 50% cheaper than any of the major cloud providers.

405
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
It's fantastic.

406
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,100
So go check them out and see what I've been saying and support the show all in one go.

407
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,780
Linode.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linode for sponsoring the unplugged

408
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:46,620
program Linode.com slash unplugged.

409
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:52,500
So we decided to go hands on with all this stuff and Wes, you and I went off to our separate

410
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,140
spaces, didn't share any notes beforehand.

411
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:02,100
And I think maybe both of us ran into a couple of gotchas, but curious to hear what your

412
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,100
thoughts were.

413
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,940
As usual, we should probably mention like, this is still in beta, things are still getting

414
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:11,800
ironed out, you might run into some issues if you go off into the weeds.

415
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,620
But I chose to replace the machine I have been using mostly just sort of like a separate

416
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:21,180
second workstation away from my work stuff that's just for like gaming, hanging out playing

417
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,180
around with Linux.

418
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,940
And I had been running Pop OS 2004.

419
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:31,060
So not, you know, not cutting edge, but, but not old, I've been enjoying Popshell on there.

420
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,260
It's been pretty nice GNOME experience.

421
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:41,180
But wow, I, I was just kind of, I was blown away when I put 34 on there because it just,

422
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,140
it really felt like a different machine.

423
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,300
It was, it was so much faster.

424
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:50,000
And I don't know how much of it was really just like, real speed, but the perception,

425
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,740
the changes in how the animations happen, the interactivity of the system.

426
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,220
Well, you're going from X to Wayland in that transition.

427
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,620
Yeah, that's kind of why I wanted to do it because I have Wayland on other machines around

428
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,620
here.

429
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,660
But that one had been just sort of reserved as the last bastion of X in my house anyway.

430
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,660
Yeah, yeah.

431
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,180
Yeah, it is way faster.

432
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,540
That is something that I want to talk more about.

433
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:15,980
But I think we you had you had success with gestures and my gestures didn't work at all.

434
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,980
Is that right?

435
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,980
Okay, yeah.

436
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,020
I mean, there's maybe controversial, not something I've really traditionally used, but I felt

437
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,940
like I needed to give it a try because that's one of the highlights of the work that's been

438
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,460
going on.

439
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,540
And this is just on a sort of beefy laptop, but nothing special, not a brilliant trackpad

440
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,740
or anything fancy.

441
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,540
They were really nice.

442
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,940
I think I'm going to keep using them.

443
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:42,820
I mean, any system that's running GNOME, you know, GNOME 40 or above, super handy.

444
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:47,860
You can just swipe up or down to sort of go out into the expanded view or not go get a

445
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:52,520
quick overview of everything or if you want to swipe to go easily switch applications,

446
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
that's nice.

447
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,480
And then you've got swiping left to right to go between your workspaces, which is super

448
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
handy.

449
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,220
I don't have to lift my hands up, go find control alt and the arrow key.

450
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,180
It was just it was really smooth to you know, like on a kind of crummy trackpad on Linux,

451
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,020
my expectations were honestly low, definitely low.

452
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,620
I sort of figured it'd be kind of stuttery or laggy.

453
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,180
But no, and I could just swipe back and forth and it felt like using a fancy tablet.

454
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,900
Hey, that's nice.

455
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,900
Yeah.

456
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:25,340
So I'm curious now you got so you're coming from a curated GNOME experience with POP.

457
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,660
You've obviously got a plasma install.

458
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:35,100
And now you're on GNOME Shell 40 with this new overview layout with the gesture support.

459
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,500
Which one are you preferring the most?

460
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,380
Okay, well, on 34 beta, you know, I'd mostly just been playing around with things.

461
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,940
I hadn't got it totally configured yet.

462
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:49,340
So it was, it felt a little Spartan compared to the curated POP experience.

463
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,080
But that's okay, you know, with like a little theming, a little bit of love, installing

464
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,820
a couple plugins, maybe I think it's gonna get there.

465
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:02,140
I do still like a lot of what the POP Shell and the Tiling integrations and I think long

466
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,840
term on a production machine, I might want to add that back.

467
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,780
But I like the changes in 40.

468
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,780
I think it's good.

469
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,700
It felt like a very friendly, easy to use desktop.

470
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,300
I liked, I mean, even just without thinking about it.

471
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,100
You know, I've read through the articles, I've played with it before in a VM, but I

472
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,100
didn't have to worry about that.

473
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,380
I didn't have to walk myself through like, oh, yeah, right, this is what changed.

474
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,900
I just sat down and used it and it felt good.

475
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:31,100
Yeah, in my experience on a laptop, this horizontal layout that they have now and with

476
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,980
gestures when you have them, it's really, really efficient.

477
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,460
Because the gestures, your hands, if you can, obviously you can invoke them with the keyboard

478
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,280
if your hands are on the keyboard.

479
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,500
But it's nice to have an option if your hand is on the mouse.

480
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,900
And on a trackpad, it's sort of just this effortless swipe motion.

481
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,940
It almost feels like you're casting the windows on your screen with the swipe to begin with.

482
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,940
It's natural.

483
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,940
Yes, it's very physical.

484
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,940
Yeah.

485
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,940
And it's nice.

486
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:01,780
And then you can fly through that interface really fast and rearrange windows super quick.

487
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:05,340
My concern is still about having multiple screens and vertical screens still remain.

488
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:11,740
But on the laptop experience, boy, is it nice, it is really, really great.

489
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,620
So I did my deployment on my X1 Carbon.

490
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,500
Felt good to be back on Fedora on the X1 Carbon.

491
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,380
And you've been previously running Arch on there, right?

492
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,740
Yes, with Plasma.

493
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,300
So it's all still all recent software.

494
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,300
Right.

495
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,300
Man, is it tight.

496
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,060
I don't really consider that a fast machine.

497
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,380
But yeah, but it's really the whole package.

498
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,980
WipeWire comes in, it's seamless, it's transparent.

499
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,980
They've nailed it.

500
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:42,620
I think the community is going to be comfortable adopting this.

501
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:45,980
And what I have used in production, like I said earlier, I like it a lot.

502
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,740
Firefox 86 is part of this mix.

503
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,980
86 looks great.

504
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,540
It's super smooth and fast.

505
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,460
The Fedora 34 version runs under Wayland.

506
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,980
And it's great.

507
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,860
It renders even nicer and smoother.

508
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,600
I mean, the bottom line here, what Wes and I are saying is this new technology stuff

509
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,820
is coming together and it's fast.

510
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,780
All these improvements are equaling speed.

511
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:14,980
We've just gotten a bunch of nice new things and it's making stuff faster and more secure.

512
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:19,940
Wayland and all of the hard work that went into making everything work great on it, which

513
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:26,940
has been a Herculean task, is paying off now in major ways.

514
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,300
It's at a stage now, and this is going to be a different benchmark for each of us.

515
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,500
But for me, it's at a stage now where I want to run it.

516
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,460
I prefer to use Wayland.

517
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,020
It's not just your sort of incentive to try all the hot new shiny software regardless

518
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,160
of if it works, but like you want it because of the features, right?

519
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:49,380
It's part of now how I set up my machine to have the best, smoothest experience, to make

520
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,620
it feel like the investment in my X1 Carbon was worth it.

521
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,300
It's not being forced on me.

522
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:59,500
I am electing now to use Wayland and I really don't have stability issues either.

523
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,700
It's a different bar for each of us.

524
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,140
I know some of you NVIDIA users are sitting there going, nice to be you, Chris, but it'll

525
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,140
get there for you too.

526
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,660
It's going to maybe be until the summer, but it's going to get there.

527
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,260
But my bar has been reached and I'm all in on Wayland now.

528
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:16,860
I have no compelling reason not to use it on my personal systems between as long as

529
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,700
I stick with AMD graphics and Intel graphics.

530
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:27,940
But all of that, that whole stack coming together makes my X1 Carbon feel like a super fast

531
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,940
machine.

532
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,060
X4 is just a solid release of Fedora so far.

533
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,100
Wayland has really gotten somewhere and all the work that went into it, all of the performance

534
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,740
improvements that have gone into GNOME 40.

535
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,460
And we should acknowledge there's a lot of great desktops out there.

536
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:47,260
Plasma 5.21 is also looking fantastic, but today we're talking about this stack.

537
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,940
It's really nice.

538
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,820
It's professional grade.

539
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:55,760
And what really put it over the top, because I finally got around to figuring out where

540
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:03,220
it's hidden in the user management UI to enable fingerprint login to the GNOME Shell desktop.

541
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,440
And my ThinkPad X1 Carbon has a fingerprint reader on it.

542
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,660
Super simple to set up.

543
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:16,020
And to my absolute delight, they even lapped Apple and it can be used for pseudo privileges

544
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,020
in the terminal.

545
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,340
Now that is fancy, dang.

546
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,340
Yeah.

547
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,180
So I can fingerprint sensor from...

548
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:34,500
I just, this thing feels so pro, it is lean, mean, fast now in like a perceivable UI way.

549
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,100
And this fingerprint integration into the GNOME experience where I can even use it for

550
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,300
pseudo permissions at the terminal, I just feel like all of this combined makes this

551
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,920
one of the most professional grade setups I have ever used.

552
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:52,320
It's funny how there's all these little tiny pieces of polish, and before on the flip side

553
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,220
of all these changes, those were the little tiny pieces of polish that might keep you

554
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,940
on say like a Mac desktop just because you're making that comparison, you know, like I'm

555
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,940
trying to get work done.

556
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,620
I need a professional workstation that just gets out of my way.

557
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,620
I know it'll work.

558
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,620
It's rock solid.

559
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,940
We're slowly getting there.

560
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,200
I mean, maybe you're already there on plasma, et cetera, but it's coming together, like

561
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,020
you say, and that's just neat to see.

562
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:19,500
And it's neat to see these tiny backend changes over months and years actually have a perceptible

563
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,860
difference day-to-day on the desktop.

564
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,740
It's so cool to see it all coming together.

565
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:29,020
Like a lot of hard work has gone in for many years, but specifically in 2020, that's just

566
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,820
kind of all popping in together now.

567
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:37,340
And like you were saying, Wes, to kind of expand on that, I kind of feel like, and we

568
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:41,460
have this happen from time to time, we hear from like a disillusioned back user, they

569
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,680
get annoyed with, we were just talking with Ben before the show, you know, he gets annoyed

570
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:49,300
with something that Apple's doing or the direction Big Sur is going, or they want to stay on

571
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,700
the x86 platform or, you know, all of these list of reasons, or they just burn out and

572
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,700
they want something that's more fun, they'll look at Linux and you try to figure out, well,

573
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,500
maybe we should recommend elementary OS, maybe, you know, Ubuntu, because, you know, if you're

574
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,380
coming from the Mac, you want something that's widely supported.

575
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,140
I don't know, man, this setup, I think is what I'm going to advise.

576
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:14,620
If somebody's coming with like the low-end MacBook Pro to MacBook, high-end MacBook Air

577
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:20,580
range, and they want a Linux laptop, the X1 Carbon with Fedora 34, when that whole package

578
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,620
comes together, is going to be an easy, safe recommendation.

579
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:30,360
But the best part is, all of that stuff that's making that recommendation great is coming

580
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,780
to a distribution and computer near you.

581
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,820
It's not just exclusive to this X1 Carbon or the ThinkPad lineup, because this isn't

582
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:42,420
the Apple model, this is going to be available to system 76, this is going to be available

583
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:47,500
to Dell, and everybody is going to have this stuff that makes these systems faster and

584
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,020
perform better, and it's free for those vendors.

585
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,020
It's remarkable.

586
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,700
Now, you can get, depending on what avenue you take in the Linux space, you can get access

587
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,660
to it today if you're willing to run beta software, but I think I'm going to stick on

588
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,660
it, Wes.

589
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,520
I don't think I'm going to go back to a stable release, I'm just going to stick with this

590
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,520
and roll with it.

591
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,400
You're just going to see what happens.

592
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,380
And that means you're also moving away from Arch, huh?

593
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,740
Back over in the Fedora world.

594
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,580
Yeah, at least on that system for a bit.

595
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,580
So there's a...

596
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:23,860
I really like Arch, but Arch is a DIY kit, and sometimes I know exactly, exactly what

597
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,860
I want.

598
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,060
And I just want to go build that, and I just want it to work, and I want access to as much

599
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,300
software as possible.

600
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,540
And that is probably maybe even the most common use case for me.

601
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,460
And there's also...

602
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:45,620
You just have to acknowledge Fedora is positioned, for multiple reasons, in a space where these

603
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,300
things sort of land first curated.

604
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,180
I already have Wayland and Pipewire on my Arch box upstairs.

605
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,460
Of course you do.

606
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,460
But it doesn't really...

607
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:02,660
It's not all coming together all in this package like it does with 34, where you get 40, you

608
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:05,700
get Pipewire, you get Wayland, you get ButterFS.

609
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:12,940
Like this whole curated package that is kind of like cutting edge Linux in a thoughtfully

610
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,340
designed way.

611
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:20,460
It's an idea, it's a concept that I find extremely compelling that Arch doesn't necessarily compel

612
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,460
me in that way.

613
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,460
Right.

614
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,360
Here you're kind of in on the zeitgeist, the place where the action's happening, versus

615
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,780
in Arch, you're off on your own pulling together all this software by yourself.

616
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,420
And both can be useful use cases.

617
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,820
That's the beautiful thing about Linux, right?

618
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,580
And many others that aren't even defined by those two.

619
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:41,060
But I think the nice thing is to see all of it, to see the different elements.

620
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,460
Like the teams also spent the last couple of years working on a new logo, and that's

621
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,880
going to land with 34, which is going to land with 40.

622
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,480
It all really comes together as sort of a symphony of open source software development

623
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,780
in this particular release.

624
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,720
And so it is fun to be running it.

625
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,140
And we didn't even get into Toolbox, which you know Christian loves to talk about.

626
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:06,060
But legitimately, Toolbox is a great way to have quick little pet containers.

627
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,740
And now they're making it possible where you can run the RHEL universal base image.

628
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:17,140
So you could just fire up a Toolbox instance that's RHEL based on your Fedora 34 workstation.

629
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,620
And so you can have a development environment that's totally RHEL production while having

630
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,620
a cutting edge desktop experience.

631
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:29,740
Like that, man, it's a sweet combination and you can really see it all coming together.

632
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:34,580
And I love that there is space to talk about this, because it's not just this one thing

633
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,460
that's going to have all these features.

634
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,060
And that's what you get in the Apple world is this one thing and they have these big

635
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:44,460
bursts like at WWDC where they announce all the new things that this one siloed place

636
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,900
is going to have.

637
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,660
And here it's everyone gets it.

638
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,660
It's just so cool.

639
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,020
Yeah, you can take the pieces you want, you get the updated apps.

640
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,740
You don't have to run any or all of it if you don't want to.

641
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,620
Stay on X if you want, but still play with pipeline.

642
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,520
It's all possible.

643
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:06,160
Let's do just a spot of cleaning around here and mention a little housekeeping items.

644
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,160
We are getting close to episode 400.

645
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,800
If you haven't been to a live show in a while, might be worth putting on your calendar.

646
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,380
Just a few weeks out and come hang out with us and celebrate our 400th episode.

647
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,500
And of course, our lifetime.

648
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,540
You can get that at Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar.

649
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,540
It's noon Pacific.

650
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,520
You know, it is actually it's pretty easy.

651
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,900
The telegram group's going as well.

652
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:33,140
Join us at Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash telegram and in the lup lug every Sunday at

653
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,140
noon Pacific.

654
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,120
Again, that's on our calendar.

655
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,120
And that happened.

656
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,780
That just happens in our in our Mumble Room right there in the lobby.

657
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,180
People just hang out talking Linux.

658
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,180
It's pretty nice.

659
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,180
It's pretty cool.

660
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,180
And you can hang out and do it, too.

661
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,420
And then you're all set up for the show when it comes time for you to join.

662
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,540
Maybe on episode 400 and hang out with us.

663
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,540
Huh?

664
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,540
Huh?

665
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,540
We'd like to see you.

666
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,740
That would be pretty great.

667
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,140
So check out the lup lug and get your mumble information.

668
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,660
All of that at Linux unplugged dot com.

669
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,660
And last but not least, I'll just mention we have the all shows feed that I'd love you

670
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,060
to take advantage of.

671
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,860
That way you just get all the shows, all the shows, because there's a lot more going on.

672
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,960
Like we have Linux Action News every Sunday with Wes and I.

673
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,620
We try to break down the biggest news items that you need to know about, kind of with

674
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,940
the mindset that if you're trying to stay current on the industry, these are the trends

675
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,640
we think you should be watching.

676
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,300
And we do that in Linux Action News at Linux Action News dot com.

677
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,980
So go check that out.

678
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,620
And that, my friends, is the housekeeping.

679
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,380
What do you say we do a couple of picks before we go?

680
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,740
Oh, have you have you got something special for us this week?

681
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:42,500
Well, you know, we have we had like a run of different types of top apps.

682
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,500
And that's fun.

683
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,580
I think every single possible one.

684
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,460
Yeah, as far as I know.

685
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,340
But you know, we've never had a kernel top app until now.

686
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,260
Like if you could call it that, I guess.

687
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,660
It's called Kmon.

688
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:59,700
It's the Linux kernel manager and activity monitor.

689
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,540
And it's kind of neat, Wes, to kind of explore what your kernel is doing.

690
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,460
Yeah, it is just a handy little command line app.

691
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,660
You can go download it on GitHub.

692
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,260
And by default, you get just a nice little terminal interface where it lists out all

693
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,260
your modules.

694
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,260
You can scroll through.

695
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,640
You can have that interaction with your keyboard input or also the mouse, it looks like.

696
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,880
And it's got a handy log of all the stuff your kernels been up to.

697
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,540
Even better than that, Chris, it's written in Rust.

698
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:36,300
Oh, no way.

699
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,300
You didn't say anything.

700
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,540
You waited to tell me that.

701
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,820
I know how you like to be surprised.

702
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:48,300
All right, well, I'm going to submit a Linux application that is a Mac favorite, but with

703
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,700
a much cooler Linux twist.

704
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,180
When we do it, we do it right.

705
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:55,820
It's called eBPF snitch.

706
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:01,900
If you're familiar with little snitch on the Mac platform, it would monitor outbound traffic

707
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:07,240
and snitch on an application that is trying to connect to a server without your permission.

708
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:13,660
And you could discover some interesting metrics being collected by using an app like this.

709
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:18,700
Well, eBPF snitch is a Linux application level firewall that's based on eBPF, which we've

710
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:21,420
talked about, and NFQ.

711
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,620
Of course, it's inspired by OpenSnitch, which is also we've mentioned before on the show.

712
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:30,460
But it uses more modern kernel abstractions without the need of a kernel module, which

713
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,460
is great.

714
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,020
The daemon is implemented in C++ 20.

715
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:39,300
And the interface to manage it all is Python 3 with Qt 5 bindings for the UI.

716
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,300
I mean, it works.

717
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,660
It's not the prettiest UI, but I don't know what you want for something like this.

718
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,140
Yeah, what do you expect?

719
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,140
Yeah.

720
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,140
Yeah.

721
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,780
All right, you got to get the features in first to make it actually work, and we'll

722
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,780
pretty it up later.

723
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,780
Yeah.

724
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,420
And yeah, I think that this uses eBPF is super exciting.

725
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:58,260
You know, there's been some issues, I know, in recent Mac releases around little snitch

726
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,500
and having to add modules on the Mac side or similar techniques here.

727
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,320
Any time you're directly messing with the kernel, well, maybe you get a little nervous

728
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,020
or it's a reason not to install it.

729
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,460
But if you have a modern kernel, you have eBPF support, this seems like a no brainer.

730
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,800
Although disclaimer, security of this application has not been audited by a third party, or

731
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,460
even myself from rights the developer.

732
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,060
So hey, there you go.

733
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,300
Westpain cannot guarantee the security nor can the developer.

734
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,280
Don't blame me blame Chris.

735
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,340
Don't you know it's it's blame Alan Jude.

736
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,340
It's always blame Alan Jude.

737
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,340
All right.

738
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,380
Well, hey, Wes.

739
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,120
How about a little bit of feedback before we go?

740
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:39,500
We had somebody write in on the Docker socket security thing that we talked about in a recent

741
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
episode.

742
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:46,740
Frank the Tank writes in again, writing in regards to episode 395 and the misconfiguration

743
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,820
Neil had used to take over the system.

744
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,940
As far as I remember, it was the ability to access the Docker socket.

745
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:59,140
Now, I run Debian 10 on my machine, and that isn't possible as a regular user.

746
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:04,540
Although I didn't configure anything in those regards and Docker can wrap arm or anything.

747
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:10,100
So how come it works on your Debian nine system, the default change from stretch to buster?

748
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,500
I'm afraid my machine also has this vulnerability without me knowing it.

749
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,900
Can you please explain a little bit more about how to avoid it?

750
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,760
Thanks a lot, Frank.

751
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,940
Good question, Frank.

752
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,940
Thank you for writing that in.

753
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,100
So did we tinker with it beyond any defaults?

754
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,220
I remember we had several discussions around it, but I can't remember what we ended up

755
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,220
ultimately doing.

756
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,220
Yeah.

757
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:35,420
So in our case, it was just that that user shouldn't have had access to the Docker socket.

758
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:40,380
So whether that was misconfiguration of the user permissions, adding it to a group, say,

759
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,740
or that was misconfigurations of permissions on the socket itself, either way, the result

760
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,740
was the same.

761
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:50,060
But by default, hopefully your distro doesn't have that and that any users that don't need

762
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,980
access will make sure they don't have it.

763
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,300
Yeah, it was really to demonstrate how risky that is.

764
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:00,000
But I recall the other thing, Frank, I think to keep in mind that we did to just make it

765
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,580
achievable in the time span that we had is we enabled the backup account to have shell

766
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,840
access and then that password got leaked.

767
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:13,700
So that the reason why we did that is because with the exception of leaking, as far as I

768
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:19,820
know, I actually have seen that in production, that that configuration that we we went with.

769
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:24,220
And so it is very common, or at least possible.

770
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:30,300
But it does require at least having, in our case, the backup user in the Docker group.

771
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,300
That's right.

772
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,580
That was kind of the concession we made.

773
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:37,500
But I think it also demonstrates just the risk you do take by having that Docker daemon

774
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,860
run as root.

775
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,180
Yeah, exactly.

776
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:45,020
Think carefully about what you're giving access, what accounts, what users and maybe consider

777
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,940
something like Podman.

778
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:51,380
Or at least don't let Neil on your system.

779
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,180
So yeah, there's that.

780
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,220
We're going to do it again, though.

781
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:58,020
I think we'll give it some time and then we're going to do another one.

782
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,100
So stay tuned, Frank.

783
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:03,620
Alex writes in, I asked about exiting big picture mode because I was playing with that

784
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:08,400
Steam Link application that was recently released by Valve and Collabra that just is essentially

785
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:15,220
a thin client streaming app to connect to another PC running Steam, Windows or Linux.

786
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,500
And you get in big picture mode and every now and then I had confused it and I could

787
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,780
tell there must have been a way to get to the desktop.

788
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,620
I actually got a couple of tips, but I liked Alex's just because it was so simple.

789
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,820
He says it's really easy when you're in big picture mode.

790
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:31,980
Just go to the gear icon in the top right and hit close big picture mode.

791
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,300
Then you're just in a regular remote desktop session.

792
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,020
I do it all the time and it works well.

793
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,020
Thanks for the show, Alex.

794
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,020
How about that?

795
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,860
That sounds really simple.

796
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,860
Just exit it.

797
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:45,500
So you're giving tips about replacing Jack and Pulse with PipeWire and then the audience

798
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,300
is giving you tips about how to exit your app to the desktop.

799
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,300
I guess so.

800
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,660
Hey, you know what?

801
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:56,500
That's fine by me, linuxunplug.com slash contact if you want to suggest an app pick or respond

802
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,100
to something we've talked about on the show or share your thoughts about the future direction

803
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:04,520
of the Linux desktop and why it's more interesting than ever because there's many reasons we

804
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,220
didn't even touch on in this episode and you could give voice to some of them at linuxunplug.com

805
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,220
slash contact.

806
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:14,140
Hey, Wes, did you know they could get more of you at linuxactionnews.com?

807
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,140
Yes they can.

808
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,140
That's true.

809
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:20,100
There's more stuff going on than what we managed to cover in this episode and so we packaged

810
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,860
it all up in an easy to digest format at linuxactionnews.com.

811
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:27,340
If you do the Twitter thing, you can follow this show at linuxunplugged.

812
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,720
I'm at Chris Lass.

813
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:29,780
What about you, Wes?

814
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:31,140
I'm at Wes Payne.

815
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:36,740
Hey, that's easy and today I was even teasing what we're talking about and getting the conversation

816
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:42,640
rolling there and the entire Jupiter Broadcasting Network of fantastic shows, well you can find

817
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,280
that at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

818
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,320
There's more shows.

819
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,500
Did you know that?

820
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,500
Just check that out.

821
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,500
I mean, why not?

822
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,500
JupiterBroadcasting.com.

823
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:52,500
Why not?

824
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:57,180
And while you're there, head to slash calendar to find out when will next be live.

825
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,980
Sure, it's usually the same bad time, but you never know.

826
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,380
See you next week.

827
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,420
Same bad time, same bad station.

828
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,500
As far as we know, it will be, but you never know.

829
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,500
Things could change.

830
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,500
Things could change.

831
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:14,340
I've been tinkering with an idea in my head, so it is worth checking that from time to

832
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,340
time.

833
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,780
Otherwise, join us at 12 PM Pacific, 3 PM Eastern on a Tuesday.

It's all over there.

837
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:34,100
It's all over there, man, at linuxunplugged.com, so go check it out.

838
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:38,860
Thank you so much for joining us on this week's episode of Your Unplugged program.

839
00:46:38,860 --> 00:47:07,980
And with all of that said, future and all, we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

840
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:26,020
Okay, JBtitles.com, let's go pick our title.

841
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:31,500
And then also, I just wanted to mention, because I know a lot of us in the community are Telegram

842
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:37,220
users, it looks like Telegram is in a tough spot.

843
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:42,660
They're looking to basically raise like a billion in debt funds.

844
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:50,300
The messaging service has about $700 million due at the end of April to creditors.

845
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:56,500
And of course, at the same time, as we've all seen, Telegram's usage is exploding right

846
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,500
now.

847
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:02,860
And so the expenses for bandwidth and storage are described as rapidly growing.

848
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:08,100
Are you saying I should stop uploading giant mp4s just to send to myself via Telegram?

849
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,100
Dang it.

850
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,460
Yeah, Telegram is going to have to start raising money.

851
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:16,380
So expect to see ads soon, because if they're going to go raise money and get a bunch of

852
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,600
funds in, they're going to have to promise these investors a return on that money.

853
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,820
And the way they're going to do that is probably through some sort of ad system or subscription,

854
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,820
I don't know.

855
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,820
Would you pay?

856
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:27,820
Would you subscribe?

857
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,820
I think I would.

858
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:35,260
I've heard a lot about it and Telegram so far, I think we all still remain slightly

859
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:40,100
suspicious of their own crypto that they've decided to implement for secret chats.

860
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:46,620
But relatively speaking, it has been unbelievably solid for years now.

861
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:50,420
And it handles crazy scale groups, because I got in some of those Wall Street bet groups

862
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,980
for fun and they were crazy sized.

863
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:56,920
It handles low bandwidth situations really well.

864
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:04,700
And also, the desktop client is really reasonable when you look at the other chat desktop clients

865
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:06,500
out there for chat services.

866
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,300
I think Telegram is like one of the best.

867
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,860
Yeah, they've just kind of continued to be a good chat client.

868
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:15,100
That's always what keeps me there is it's like, okay, you're fast, you're easy, you

869
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:19,180
support me sending all the different, you know, gifts or images or attachments.

870
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:22,260
I mean, I've had my family on there and they haven't complained.

871
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,820
So that's got to be a test too, right?

872
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,660
Yeah, I have my family on there.

873
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,500
It all works for them.

874
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:32,300
And I haven't really noticed the Telegram desktop client for Linux lagging far behind

875
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,140
the commercial platforms versions.

876
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:39,020
And I still really appreciate the fact that they have certain accessibility tools like

877
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:43,140
Zoom and Scale that I like, and they integrate natively with my desktop notifications.

878
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:48,740
I mean, all in all, as far as features go for a desktop chat application that also has

879
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:54,060
a great mobile app, that also has a web client available that has a lot of features, including

880
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:58,140
voice calling and video calling and group chats and channels and private messages and

881
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:02,140
secret chats and self-destructing chats and, you know, on and on and on, right?

882
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,140
It's pretty good.

883
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,140
I'd hate to see it go away.

884
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:10,000
And I would much rather pay $10 a month, I guess, than have ads in my chats.

885
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,300
That I don't really want.

886
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,740
Or maybe ads in the Jupiter broadcasting channel, right?

887
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:15,740
Yeah.

888
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,260
Yeah, I don't like that.

889
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:20,780
How would you say that Telegram stacks up against Matrix?

890
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:24,140
Well, it's way more accessible by regular folks.

891
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:28,660
You know, I can have a family member get on Telegram in 15 minutes just to do a chat session

892
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:29,660
with them.

893
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:34,780
I couldn't have like my aunt or my uncle who I'm thinking of in this scenario, they wouldn't

894
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,780
be able to set up Matrix.

895
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,400
It'd be beyond them for sure.

896
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,820
Even Element, you know, it's just, it's too complicated.

897
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:43,980
I think Telegram is a different use case as well.

898
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:48,440
Because with Matrix, I feel like it's more like the Discord use where you have a server

899
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:54,120
for a community, and then you can have a bunch of rooms on that server for more focused discussions.

900
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:56,100
It's also continuous engagement, right?

901
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,460
Telegram is very ephemeral, in a sense, because it goes by.

902
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,460
Yeah.

903
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,460
And it's also like very one on one.

904
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:05,340
Like there's oh, yeah, yeah, you can tell because like how poor the experiences for

905
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,940
group chats relative to the one on one chats.

906
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:08,940
Exactly.

907
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:13,500
It's definitely came as a direct person to person messenger first, with group chat features

908
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,220
later where Matrix was built with group chat in mind.

909
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,220
So it just depends what goal.

910
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:20,860
So for me, like if I'm just communicating something quickly with people, I think Telegram

911
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,600
may be the better solution if it's just one on one chats.

912
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,540
But if I'm already in Matrix, you know, then just use Element.

913
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:33,260
Anyways, I just think it's a tricky spot they're in to have $700 million due by the end of

914
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,260
April.

915
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:39,100
They kind of went all in on hoping a coin would be their path to revenue, and then got

916
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,060
shut down by the regulators.

917
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,980
And now they're kind of having to figure out a plan B. And it doesn't seem like it's super

918
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:46,500
solid yet.

919
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,620
And so I mean, I'm grateful for options like Matrix kernel because we have a pretty solid

920
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:56,260
plan B. There's obviously other platforms out there like Signal and Wire.

921
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:58,500
And I know a lot of people use WhatsApp and others.

922
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,480
Telegram has just sort of been the one that I've landed on and a lot of my family and

923
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,300
friends and community have landed on.

924
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,300
So who do you think is going to buy them?

925
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,540
That's the question, isn't it?

926
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,540
I don't know.

927
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,020
Leave your prediction below.

928
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:23,740
Maybe it'll be a Tesla jet.
