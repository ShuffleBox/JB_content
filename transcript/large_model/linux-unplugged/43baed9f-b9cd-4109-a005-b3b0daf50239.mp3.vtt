WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
Did you hear? Flight Simulator is back.

00:03.200 --> 00:04.120
Oh, the classic.

00:04.120 --> 00:05.560
Yeah, the Microsoft game.

00:05.560 --> 00:07.240
Hey, what's old is new again?

00:07.240 --> 00:11.160
Well, yeah, because it's powered by AI in the cloud, I guess.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.080
And uses Bing.

00:13.080 --> 00:13.880
What?

00:13.880 --> 00:14.720
How do you-

00:14.720 --> 00:15.540
Like the Bing data.

00:15.540 --> 00:16.380
What?

00:16.380 --> 00:17.880
Oh, for like the mapping and stuff.

00:17.880 --> 00:18.920
Yeah.

00:18.920 --> 00:22.240
Huh, okay, is there any way I can run this on Linux?

00:22.240 --> 00:23.080
I don't know.

00:23.080 --> 00:24.940
Okay, we'll probably come out on the PC and Xbox.

00:24.940 --> 00:27.840
We don't know when yet.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.120
Interestingly though, I mean,

00:29.120 --> 00:30.720
we saw them doing stuff with Age of Empires.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.920
It seems like Microsoft's jumping back into games.

00:32.920 --> 00:34.920
They're saying exactly that, you know,

00:34.920 --> 00:36.400
they want to be a game engine.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.240
Yeah, I doubt they're going to bring it to Linux,

00:38.240 --> 00:41.600
but if there's one gift Proton could give me,

00:41.600 --> 00:42.600
Flight Sim would be it.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.200
That, I'd actually play that.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.400
You might not get your work done.

00:45.400 --> 00:46.400
Hello, friends, and welcome into a very special edition

00:46.400 --> 00:47.400
of Linux Unplugged.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.400
My name is Chris.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.400
My name is Wes.

00:49.400 --> 00:50.400
Hello, Wes.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.400
This is Chris.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.400
Welcome to a very special edition of Linux Unplugged.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.400
Welcome to a very special edition of Linux Unplugged.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.400
Welcome to a very special edition of Linux Unplugged.

00:54.400 --> 00:55.400
Welcome to a very special edition of Linux Unplugged.

00:55.400 --> 00:59.920
Welcome to a very special edition of Linux Unplugged.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.520
It is delightful to be with you today.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.520
Oh, my.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.080
We have a big show today.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.720
What do you do after you got a fresh install?

01:06.720 --> 01:08.920
We're going to chat with our virtual lug and each other

01:08.920 --> 01:12.720
and figure out our perfect post install process.

01:12.720 --> 01:13.720
That was pretty good.

01:13.720 --> 01:14.720
Can you say it again?

01:14.720 --> 01:15.720
No, I have no idea what I just said.

01:15.720 --> 01:16.720
Perfect post install process.

01:16.720 --> 01:17.720
Yeah.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.360
I mean, really, this is actually something that we all have to consider.

01:20.360 --> 01:22.040
It's like, what do you do to make your box perfect

01:22.040 --> 01:24.640
and get back to work after you reload?

01:24.640 --> 01:28.600
I asked this question today both to the live stream and to Twitter,

01:28.600 --> 01:30.240
and I got a surprising amount of people saying

01:30.240 --> 01:33.540
they just had reloaded their boxes today.

01:33.540 --> 01:36.200
So it says, maybe there's something about October.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.200
Even if you don't change distros all the time,

01:38.200 --> 01:41.200
it turns out we enthusiasts, we kind of install things a lot.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.200
Yeah.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.680
And we got the perfect panel to go through all of this.

01:44.680 --> 01:47.820
In fact, if I'm going to keep the alliteration going,

01:47.820 --> 01:52.400
we have the perfect panel to plow through this process.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.880
Hello, cheese and Mr. Alex.

01:54.880 --> 01:55.880
Hello.

01:55.880 --> 01:56.880
Hello.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.080
I don't know how much plowing we'll actually be doing though.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.240
Well, we'll plow through the field of knowledge.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.240
So that's what matters.

02:01.240 --> 02:03.760
I'm on a roll.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.760
Just go with it.

02:04.760 --> 02:08.840
Pedantically, perfectly pedestrian.

02:08.840 --> 02:11.480
I can hold a straight face, but when Wes cracks,

02:11.480 --> 02:13.120
it makes me laugh every single time.

02:13.120 --> 02:17.160
And of course, we have our virtual lug time appropriate greetings, Bumble Room.

02:17.160 --> 02:18.160
Good morning.

02:18.160 --> 02:19.160
Hello.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.160
Howdy, hello.

02:20.160 --> 02:21.160
Happy Linux Tuesday.

02:21.160 --> 02:23.040
Listen to that group.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.040
This look at this.

02:24.040 --> 02:29.480
You got Brent, Byte, Carl's in there, Jill's in there, Jimmy, Minimac, Sean, Tat Tech,

02:29.480 --> 02:33.480
and back after a long travel period, Mr. Martin Wimpers.

02:33.480 --> 02:34.480
Hello, Wimpy.

02:34.480 --> 02:35.480
Hello.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.400
I'm really glad you made it today because Bunta Mate is in the news.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.160
So how about that?

02:41.160 --> 02:42.160
Perfect timing.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.160
We'll get to that.

02:43.160 --> 02:49.360
But let's start with OpenSUSE, which may be called something else soon.

02:49.360 --> 02:53.200
During discussions about the OpenSUSE project logo and name change that started in June,

02:53.200 --> 02:57.400
which we talked about, the election committee received a request from the board to conduct

02:57.400 --> 03:05.040
a vote whereby the OpenSUSE members can indicate whether they are for or against the project

03:05.040 --> 03:06.360
name change.

03:06.360 --> 03:11.040
Voting starts October 10th and runs to the end of the month, so three weeks to vote.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.040
Hmm.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.500
What would you call it, Wes?

03:13.500 --> 03:15.440
If you could name it, what would you name it?

03:15.440 --> 03:16.440
Linux.

03:16.440 --> 03:19.880
Linux S Edition.

03:19.880 --> 03:20.880
What about you, Wimpy?

03:20.880 --> 03:23.600
If you could name OpenSUSE today, what would you name it?

03:23.600 --> 03:25.360
Linux like it used to be.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.360
Yeah.

03:26.360 --> 03:27.360
Yeah.

03:27.360 --> 03:28.360
That's good too.

03:28.360 --> 03:29.360
Yeah.

03:29.360 --> 03:33.660
Or why not call it yet another distro?

03:33.660 --> 03:34.660
We have fun.

03:34.660 --> 03:35.660
Oh, that's good.

03:35.660 --> 03:36.660
Yeah.

03:36.660 --> 03:37.920
We have fun.

03:37.920 --> 03:40.280
I've been using OpenSUSE for so long.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.420
I used OpenSUSE before they called it OpenSUSE.

03:43.420 --> 03:45.840
They called it SUSE back in my day.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.600
It is always interesting just watching the project function, right?

03:48.600 --> 03:52.600
This is a big decision and you need a way to be able to constructively discuss that

03:52.600 --> 03:53.600
as a community.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.900
So, power to them.

03:54.900 --> 03:56.960
This is actually a great opportunity.

03:56.960 --> 04:02.120
And I wonder if we won't see something that's chameleon inspired or something like that.

04:02.120 --> 04:03.120
Yeah.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.120
That makes sense.

04:04.120 --> 04:10.480
And much like I make fun, but I also have love for OpenSUSE.

04:10.480 --> 04:14.680
You know, it's a project that I have a long heritage with and it has been around for a

04:14.680 --> 04:18.960
long time and we will follow the story with interest because it does matter.

04:18.960 --> 04:19.960
Absolutely.

04:19.960 --> 04:26.840
Now, I am supremely elated, I can't think of an alliteration on that, to talk about

04:26.840 --> 04:30.480
Ubuntu Mate 1910's new release notes.

04:30.480 --> 04:39.880
Now this is a beta at this point, but I wouldn't necessarily say that's a bad thing.

04:39.880 --> 04:44.200
I mean, we're all, I think if you're listening to this podcast, you're probably comfortable

04:44.200 --> 04:46.400
trying out a beta at this stage.

04:46.400 --> 04:47.840
And if not, well, stay away.

04:47.840 --> 04:52.400
And maybe you have that particular piece of hardware that they need a bug report on and

04:52.400 --> 04:54.080
this is the perfect time to do it.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.880
A great way to give back.

04:55.880 --> 04:59.600
So I normally would say, you know what, let's skip a beta.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.300
But I'm actually, I'm changing a little.

05:01.300 --> 05:06.360
I think Wimpy, you've convinced me, I listened to the Ubuntu podcast, you convinced me at

05:06.360 --> 05:10.920
this stage, and especially for this particular crowd, I'm not saying for everybody, but for

05:10.920 --> 05:16.040
this crowd, actually give a beta a go because there's a lot in here and maybe you can catch

05:16.040 --> 05:17.040
something.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.040
Yeah.

05:18.040 --> 05:23.520
So I did express this sentiment on the last episode of the Ubuntu podcast.

05:23.520 --> 05:24.520
It's quite frustrating.

05:24.520 --> 05:28.300
And this is not an Ubuntu Mate specific thing.

05:28.300 --> 05:34.080
This applies to insert name of your favorite Linux distribution.

05:34.080 --> 05:40.240
You quite often see the leads of the various distributions post about their, you know,

05:40.240 --> 05:42.960
their betas and their release candidates.

05:42.960 --> 05:47.680
And you will see a series of replies that say, oh, well, it's a beta.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.200
It's a release candidate.

05:50.200 --> 05:55.320
I'll come back and install it when it's stable, when everybody else has done the hard work

05:55.320 --> 05:57.180
to make sure it's okay.

05:57.180 --> 06:03.000
And then you see those very same people whinging when stuff that's important to them doesn't

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
work.

06:04.000 --> 06:08.840
Like maybe random wifi issues that plague one particular user who perhaps could have

06:08.840 --> 06:10.920
caught it earlier in the cycle.

06:10.920 --> 06:11.920
Right.

06:11.920 --> 06:12.920
Exactly so.

06:12.920 --> 06:19.320
So, you know, what you need to do is actually think about, you know, what your social responsibility

06:19.320 --> 06:21.620
is for your favorite distribution.

06:21.620 --> 06:25.400
If you're a distro hopper, I know this doesn't apply because you don't care because you just

06:25.400 --> 06:29.080
hop distros as soon as it gets hard on the distro that you've chosen.

06:29.080 --> 06:35.480
But if you're invested in a particular distro, do test the betas, do test the release candidates

06:35.480 --> 06:42.340
and see if you can find something that's not working for you that can help improve the

06:42.340 --> 06:47.720
final product because it won't magically get better if people don't do that.

06:47.720 --> 06:50.480
First of all, I want to say a fantastic write up.

06:50.480 --> 06:53.120
We'll have linked in the show notes on this new release.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.240
I don't know what you're going to do now for the actual release because you can't top this.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.040
So it's these notes.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.880
In fact, this is a living document.

06:59.880 --> 07:04.320
So as we're fixing things, you'll see that there are this is what we fix since the beta

07:04.320 --> 07:06.880
it already started to appear in this document.

07:06.880 --> 07:07.880
Oh, great.

07:07.880 --> 07:13.360
And then just just tangently, I'm just curious, did you write it with emoticons inline or

07:13.360 --> 07:17.680
did you write it and then go back and enhance it with the emoticons?

07:17.680 --> 07:22.040
Obviously, you put the emoticons in as you type it, because that's what, you know, sensible

07:22.040 --> 07:24.120
human beings do in 2019.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.080
I mean, solid execution, I got to say.

07:26.080 --> 07:31.440
So you call this a paper cut release in this post, but yeah, I'm looking at this and I'm

07:31.440 --> 07:39.520
thinking maybe I mean, this is it's more it's more changes than you'd see in a Mac OS release.

07:39.520 --> 07:45.200
It feels like it's a yes, it's paper cuts, but it's also it's really kind of when you

07:45.200 --> 07:46.280
add it all up.

07:46.280 --> 07:48.080
It's a substantial amount of change.

07:48.080 --> 07:49.080
It is.

07:49.080 --> 07:56.160
There are significant changes, but addressing paper cuts is the undertone to everything

07:56.160 --> 08:02.400
that we addressed in this release, even when it's big stuff like changing the default email

08:02.400 --> 08:03.400
client.

08:03.400 --> 08:07.600
You know, there is a bigger story there about the paper cut that addresses.

08:07.600 --> 08:08.600
All right.

08:08.600 --> 08:09.760
So let's get to that.

08:09.760 --> 08:13.520
But first, I want to talk about a couple of things that I'm impressed with.

08:13.520 --> 08:20.160
It really feels like the pain points that users actually see on a day to day basis is

08:20.160 --> 08:22.880
what was addressed here, like the changes with Marco.

08:22.880 --> 08:23.880
Oh, yeah.

08:23.880 --> 08:29.080
The Marco, like the Marco is where is the Monte window manager and no more tearing high

08:29.080 --> 08:32.520
DPI improvements, things like that that users see.

08:32.520 --> 08:41.360
But there's other smaller things like changing out VLC for celluloid and evolution, replacing

08:41.360 --> 08:42.360
Thunderbird.

08:42.360 --> 08:43.360
Right.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.200
So what is that about?

08:45.200 --> 08:49.480
So there was two things going on with both of those.

08:49.480 --> 08:56.960
The three driving things were this improving the desktop integration.

08:56.960 --> 09:04.880
If you read the post, evolution offers superior desktop integration than Thunderbird does.

09:04.880 --> 09:09.440
You know, evolution will integrate with the desktop environment in a better way.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.040
Like the calendar applet.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.520
And that's a follow on, right?

09:12.520 --> 09:18.400
So once you've once you've made that jump to, well, let's do evolution, then then it's

09:18.400 --> 09:23.280
right, well, let's improve the indicators to actually make that indicator do something

09:23.280 --> 09:24.280
useful.

09:24.280 --> 09:28.120
So rather than just being a static calendar that does nothing.

09:28.120 --> 09:32.440
Now it reflects all of the events that you've got in your calendars.

09:32.440 --> 09:37.840
Is it the evolution data server that is its own separate component that that the other

09:37.840 --> 09:40.120
things can query that makes this possible?

09:40.120 --> 09:44.120
Is that why it's why Thunderbird can't do this necessarily or isn't currently doing

09:44.120 --> 09:45.120
this?

09:45.120 --> 09:46.120
That's exactly why it is.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.400
Evolution has the evolution data server.

09:48.400 --> 09:52.360
So once that's hooked up and you've connected it to, you know, wherever your calendars and

09:52.360 --> 09:57.280
tasks and things exist, then that's automatically reflected in the indicator.

09:57.280 --> 10:01.240
And this has been something that I've wanted to get in the desktop forever because that's

10:01.240 --> 10:05.200
super useful, you know, and then you get notifications from that thing as well.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.200
Yes.

10:06.200 --> 10:11.560
Having it in the actual calendar is game changer for me with all the meetings we have.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.880
And you kind of expected in 2019.

10:13.880 --> 10:17.680
And I think the other thing to note here because you and I have talked off air about this,

10:17.680 --> 10:20.720
but I don't know if we really said much on air is that evolution hasn't necessarily been

10:20.720 --> 10:21.720
standing still.

10:21.720 --> 10:22.820
The project has been developed.

10:22.820 --> 10:23.820
It's been bug fixed.

10:23.820 --> 10:26.480
It's it's in a it's in a pretty good spot now.

10:26.480 --> 10:27.760
Yeah, it is.

10:27.760 --> 10:33.480
You know, I've I've tried evolution on and off over the years, you know, I've I've revisited

10:33.480 --> 10:39.560
it several times just within Ubuntu Marte's lifetime to think, you know, to test.

10:39.560 --> 10:40.560
Is this the right time?

10:40.560 --> 10:42.120
And it never quite has.

10:42.120 --> 10:46.080
But right now, it's a really robust option.

10:46.080 --> 10:53.680
It's a native, you know, mail calendar task memo client, and it's got tight desktop integration

10:53.680 --> 10:56.120
and it's very compelling.

10:56.120 --> 11:01.720
So I you know, I spoke to the rest of the core team and some of the upstream Marte developers

11:01.720 --> 11:06.140
and I was surprised to learn that a number of them were already choosing to install evolution

11:06.140 --> 11:08.880
and it was their default mail client already.

11:08.880 --> 11:13.000
And they, you know, rattled off a number of reasons as to why that was.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.680
So it's now the default.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.200
I know that some people will not want that.

11:17.200 --> 11:20.220
They will continue to want Thunderbird and hey, that's fine.

11:20.220 --> 11:24.840
You know, Thunderbirds in the software boutique or you've got the option to do a minimal install

11:24.840 --> 11:28.160
and then install the apps that you prefer over the top.

11:28.160 --> 11:34.840
But what you know, as a distro maintainer, what you're trying to deliver is the best

11:34.840 --> 11:38.500
outcome that you can deliver to most of the people most of the time.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.160
And I feel that evolution is the tool that does that.

11:41.160 --> 11:45.800
Well, I interestingly enough, this is where I've landed myself.

11:45.800 --> 11:49.080
Having gone back to Thunderbird for some things.

11:49.080 --> 11:53.760
But after trying out mail spring, which I can't remember the name of it before that,

11:53.760 --> 12:00.480
but you know, a so I'm looking for something that treats Google Apps as a first class citizen,

12:00.480 --> 12:03.560
because that's what our company have all your data in there.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.680
And I need to get access to it to do my job.

12:05.680 --> 12:06.680
I don't have a choice.

12:06.680 --> 12:09.160
I don't get to pick what mail service they use.

12:09.160 --> 12:14.800
And mail spring is a real, like, top tier Google Mail support, like really integrated

12:14.800 --> 12:16.600
the Nylas stuff, right?

12:16.600 --> 12:17.600
That's what it was.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.600
That's right.

12:18.600 --> 12:19.600
Yes.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.200
But it's an electron app.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
And I'm not.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.200
No, no, it's fine.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.200
It's fine.

12:25.200 --> 12:30.220
It's just when you have 1000s of emails, I don't it's just what it is.

12:30.220 --> 12:31.400
It really does get slow.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.380
And I tried to work with it in different iterations.

12:34.380 --> 12:37.480
And I ended up going back to evolution.

12:37.480 --> 12:42.240
In part because I was I was noticing that a couple of developers that I was chatting

12:42.240 --> 12:45.320
with because I like to I spy at the headers were using it.

12:45.320 --> 12:48.060
And I thought, Oh, that's interesting, because I know these these particular gentlemen get

12:48.060 --> 12:50.040
a lot of email.

12:50.040 --> 12:56.120
And I thought, well, if these guys who likely get more email than I do are using evolution,

12:56.120 --> 12:57.120
maybe it's worth a go for me.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.400
And then I started I telegrammed wimpy.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.640
And I said, this is a few months ago, I said, wimpy what email client are you using?

13:01.640 --> 13:04.920
And wimpy had switched evolution, because we were kind of on the same page with what

13:04.920 --> 13:07.080
what our requirements are.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.320
And so I gave it a go.

13:08.320 --> 13:12.520
And I found that works pretty well with Google Apps after you change a few defaults, like

13:12.520 --> 13:16.240
where your sent items are stored and things like that.

13:16.240 --> 13:22.520
But my takeaway was from having used it eight years ago, when I was desperate for exchange

13:22.520 --> 13:32.760
integration, what I considered a heavy duty application back then is a tight, native,

13:32.760 --> 13:36.280
low resources application today.

13:36.280 --> 13:42.040
Evolution back then seemed so clunky with its client side and data side that was always

13:42.040 --> 13:45.960
running in the background, and just seemed ridiculous.

13:45.960 --> 13:54.520
Eight years ago, today, it uses a tiny percent of the RAM that mail spring used.

13:54.520 --> 13:59.560
And it provides a data interface for things like wimpy is talking about, like the calendar,

13:59.560 --> 14:01.400
it just has been a much better switch.

14:01.400 --> 14:07.320
And even just setting it up, and having it connect to my calendars means that my applets

14:07.320 --> 14:08.420
are always up to date.

14:08.420 --> 14:13.720
Even if I just use the web version of Google Apps Mail, my calendar on my desktop is still

14:13.720 --> 14:14.720
current.

14:14.720 --> 14:15.720
That is nice.

14:15.720 --> 14:16.800
So that's in there.

14:16.800 --> 14:21.480
And then I think we have to talk about something that's not just going to benefit Ubuntu Mate,

14:21.480 --> 14:28.480
but Ubuntu Xfce, Zubuntu, the Cinnamon versions, the GNOME versions, the KDE versions, all

14:28.480 --> 14:35.100
of them are possibly, if they choose to use it, going to benefit from this Mate Optimus

14:35.100 --> 14:36.100
support that you've added.

14:36.100 --> 14:39.880
Now, it's going to be turned on, I believe, by default on Ubuntu Mate, if you have an

14:39.880 --> 14:46.960
NVIDIA driver, but this is some really nice, easily accessible functionality that before

14:46.960 --> 14:49.280
was pretty complicated for end users to get access to.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.760
So what's happening here with Mate Optimus?

14:51.760 --> 14:59.180
Okay, so this is a mechanism by which you can switch between, you know, the Intel IGP

14:59.180 --> 15:05.720
and the NVIDIA GPU on hybrid graphics systems.

15:05.720 --> 15:11.480
So this has been in Ubuntu Mate for some years, and it just enabled you to switch between

15:11.480 --> 15:18.240
the Intel GPU and the NVIDIA GPU, and it required you to log out in between times.

15:18.240 --> 15:27.720
But with the NVIDIA 435 drivers, they've added a new mode, which is on demand, or, you know,

15:27.720 --> 15:31.160
technically it's called the NVIDIA Prime Renderer.

15:31.160 --> 15:39.760
And if you enable that, the Intel IGP and the NVIDIA GPU are both enabled at the same

15:39.760 --> 15:44.740
time, and the NVIDIA GPU goes into this, you know, power saving state.

15:44.740 --> 15:50.920
So your desktop is rendered using the Intel IGP, but then you can choose to run specific

15:50.920 --> 15:56.760
applications or games on the NVIDIA GPU on demand as you require it.

15:56.760 --> 16:01.280
So we've got a little indicator that enables you to flip between that, and that indicator

16:01.280 --> 16:08.040
will only show up if your system meets all of the necessary hardware and, you know, configuration

16:08.040 --> 16:09.040
requirements.

16:09.040 --> 16:14.280
But once you're in on demand mode, we've got a couple of little utilities called Offload

16:14.280 --> 16:19.680
GLX and Offload Vulkan, which are command line applications, which you can just use

16:19.680 --> 16:25.240
to prepend in front of the command you want to run in order to, you know, run that particular

16:25.240 --> 16:32.360
game or application on the NVIDIA GPU for, you know, GLX acceleration or Vulkan acceleration.

16:32.360 --> 16:33.360
You can work with that.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.480
Without having to log out and log in.

16:34.480 --> 16:35.480
Exactly so.

16:35.480 --> 16:36.480
Yeah, just all dynamic.

16:36.480 --> 16:41.000
So, you know, you can do the same stuff that you can do, you know, with other, you know,

16:41.000 --> 16:46.000
Intel and AMD where you can run one workload on the Intel IGP and another workload on the

16:46.000 --> 16:49.540
NVIDIA GPU, and that can all happen simultaneously now.

16:49.540 --> 16:53.400
So what happens if I do Offload-Vulkan-Steam?

16:53.400 --> 16:57.280
Well, every sub-process that Steam executes, like the game and all of that, will that...

16:57.280 --> 16:58.280
Yeah.

16:58.280 --> 17:07.600
So at the moment, it works, you know, there's some clever machinery behind those two commands

17:07.600 --> 17:10.400
in order to make that happen.

17:10.400 --> 17:14.040
And that was where I got to with the limited time I had available.

17:14.040 --> 17:20.720
But what I'm thinking of doing is embedding into that indicator, maybe just the games

17:20.720 --> 17:27.200
category from the menus, so that you can launch, you know, right click a game and say, launch

17:27.200 --> 17:30.440
this game, you know, on the NVIDIA GPU.

17:30.440 --> 17:35.400
So it's all, you know, integrated rather than you having to know what the terminal incantations

17:35.400 --> 17:36.400
are.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.400
Right.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.400
That'd be really fun.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.680
That'd be a great way for regular old folk to be able to get that running without having

17:40.680 --> 17:41.680
to mess with it.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.760
Martin, may I say, thank you very much.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.600
That sounds absolutely fantastic.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.600
I do have a question.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.600
Sure.

17:47.600 --> 17:52.000
So I have a Lenovo P50, which I got given through work, and I've tried to use that with

17:52.000 --> 17:54.020
GPU pass through.

17:54.020 --> 18:01.220
And the NVIDIA GPU that's in there, the outputs are hardwired to the HDMI ports and whatever.

18:01.220 --> 18:04.080
In that situation, is this going to work for me or not?

18:04.080 --> 18:05.560
Yes, it can do.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.720
So it requires a little bit of setups.

18:07.720 --> 18:08.720
Really?

18:08.720 --> 18:09.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:09.720 --> 18:14.860
So if you've even if you've got one of those, like NVIDIA mining GPUs that have no outputs

18:14.860 --> 18:17.000
at all, you can make this work for you.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
Dude.

18:18.000 --> 18:25.240
So in the in the project's GitHub page, there's a link to an NVIDIA document.

18:25.240 --> 18:30.840
It's part of their installation instructions on how to set up what's called a GPU screen.

18:30.840 --> 18:40.680
And what you basically say is this Intel IGP is providing a screen for this NVIDIA GPU.

18:40.680 --> 18:46.480
And when you're in on demand mode and you tell it to offload to the NVIDIA GPU, it displays

18:46.480 --> 18:50.480
to that that whatever, whatever that Intel IGP is rendering.

18:50.480 --> 18:51.480
So it will work.

18:51.480 --> 18:54.640
So if you've got one of those and you can get these super cheap on eBay now, you know,

18:54.640 --> 18:59.520
if you've got one of these mining cards from NVIDIA that's got no outputs at all, you can

18:59.520 --> 19:03.880
now use it as an accelerated, you know, gaming graphics card.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.640
So this only works with NVIDIA, though, correct?

19:06.640 --> 19:08.520
Doesn't work with AMD GPUs?

19:08.520 --> 19:09.520
Correct.

19:09.520 --> 19:12.800
This is this is currently an NVIDIA Intel only solution.

19:12.800 --> 19:17.480
But, you know, I've I've been experimenting and I've thankfully had a review unit from

19:17.480 --> 19:23.040
Dell for far too long, which has got Intel and AMD.

19:23.040 --> 19:28.680
And I've manually, you know, looked at what's required to do this with Intel and AMD as

19:28.680 --> 19:29.680
well.

19:29.680 --> 19:33.560
So maybe at some point, if I get enough time, I will fold that in as well.

19:33.560 --> 19:40.260
So it will be a more encompassing tool, irrespective of, you know, what your GPU choices are.

19:40.260 --> 19:42.120
But this would work with an eGPU?

19:42.120 --> 19:43.120
Yes.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.120
Yes, it will.

19:44.120 --> 19:49.440
I say yes, it will, providing providing it can present as, you know, an optimus system.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.440
Right.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.440
Yes.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.440
In general, yes.

19:52.440 --> 19:53.440
Right.

19:53.440 --> 19:54.440
Which I think actually my eGPU does.

19:54.440 --> 19:55.440
Yeah.

19:55.440 --> 19:59.200
Most of the Thunderbolt based systems do present as though they're a hybrid system.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.800
So yeah, they tend to work.

20:00.800 --> 20:07.340
How much of an enabler is it to have the NVIDIA driver in the upstream Ubuntu ISO now?

20:07.340 --> 20:12.080
So how much does that now you just can assume that if the user has an NVIDIA card that

20:12.080 --> 20:15.520
they have access to the driver, so now you can build tools like this on top of it?

20:15.520 --> 20:16.520
Right.

20:16.520 --> 20:17.520
Yeah.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.520
So that's definitely part of it.

20:18.520 --> 20:23.680
So the NVIDIA drivers are now present on the ISO image.

20:23.680 --> 20:29.260
And that's really so that if you're installing and you don't have internet access, the drivers

20:29.260 --> 20:34.540
are there on the on the ISO in a local app repository.

20:34.540 --> 20:38.600
So if you tick the box that says give me third party drivers, there's a source to install

20:38.600 --> 20:42.900
those drivers, even if you're not connected to the internet.

20:42.900 --> 20:45.020
So that's where that comes from.

20:45.020 --> 20:51.660
But it does mean to say that if you are an NVIDIA user, you are likely going to come

20:51.660 --> 20:56.760
out the other side of the install with the NVIDIA drivers automatically installed and

20:56.760 --> 20:57.760
enabled.

20:57.760 --> 21:02.920
And what's most important is the way we're delivering the Intel drivers now, they're

21:02.920 --> 21:07.100
in the Ubuntu archive, they're in the main archive, and they are going to continue to

21:07.100 --> 21:14.820
get updates through the same SRU process that we use for things like the Firefox browser.

21:14.820 --> 21:20.460
So as new versions of the drivers become available, no need for PPAs.

21:20.460 --> 21:22.980
They will just appear in the main archive.

21:22.980 --> 21:26.820
And because they're in the main archive, they're also signed.

21:26.820 --> 21:31.540
So that means you can leave secure boot enabled for your NVIDIA drivers now.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.540
Fancy.

21:32.540 --> 21:33.540
That really is a big deal.

21:33.540 --> 21:34.540
That is a big deal.

21:34.540 --> 21:39.900
I think 19.10 Ubuntu Mate is shipping up to be quite a beauty.

21:39.900 --> 21:43.940
So if you'd like to give it a go and send them your feedback, link in the show notes.

21:43.940 --> 21:44.940
I mean, yeah, right?

21:44.940 --> 21:46.620
Look at all the hard work that they've been doing.

21:46.620 --> 21:48.700
They can use a little help testing it out.

21:48.700 --> 21:49.900
I'm loving this GPU work.

21:49.900 --> 21:50.900
How about you, Alex?

21:50.900 --> 21:51.900
But can it run Crysis?

21:51.900 --> 21:52.900
Well, now it can.

21:52.900 --> 21:55.340
Seriously, Martin, that is some amazing stuff.

21:55.340 --> 21:57.220
I am so happy to hear that.

21:57.220 --> 21:58.220
Thank you.

21:58.220 --> 21:59.620
Yeah, that's good.

21:59.620 --> 22:06.540
So let's chat briefly about Fedora Workstation 31 beta, which is now out and Fedora 31 is

22:06.540 --> 22:07.540
around the corner.

22:07.540 --> 22:11.980
They're doing a lot of work on ExWayland on demand.

22:11.980 --> 22:15.900
They say the goal is ExWayland on demand applications.

22:15.900 --> 22:19.780
When you need to run an ExWayland application, it would actually then start all the stack

22:19.780 --> 22:23.780
at that time instead of running it all the time using up resources.

22:23.780 --> 22:28.180
Sounds nice, but it's also a lot of work and this work has been contributed from a lot

22:28.180 --> 22:29.820
of people and companies.

22:29.820 --> 22:34.100
All started off with some work from Ian Lane at Canonical for the system to user session

22:34.100 --> 22:37.620
patches which really needed to happen to make this possible.

22:37.620 --> 22:41.100
Those have been lingering, so Benjamin Berg took those patches on and actually got them

22:41.100 --> 22:44.340
over the finish line, merged upstream.

22:44.340 --> 22:49.420
Now this isn't a hard requirement for Wayland on demand necessarily, but since it makes

22:49.420 --> 22:54.980
a lot of things work nicely between Ex and Wayland, it makes the rest of the process

22:54.980 --> 22:55.980
a lot smoother.

22:55.980 --> 22:56.980
Yeah.

22:56.980 --> 23:01.220
Future work should be simpler to implement, which means future versions of GNOME Shell

23:01.220 --> 23:02.820
will have this work in them.

23:02.820 --> 23:08.980
It also means that you could potentially get a little bit more battery saving and this

23:08.980 --> 23:13.500
work could expand to include other things in your computer like maybe the Bluetooth

23:13.500 --> 23:19.500
stack and other things that don't necessarily need to be on until the desktop session requires

23:19.500 --> 23:20.500
them.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.500
That's some of the work they're doing here.

23:21.500 --> 23:27.780
Well, another piece that you might like, Chris, is Firefox running natively and nicely on

23:27.780 --> 23:28.780
Wayland.

23:28.780 --> 23:29.780
Very much, yeah.

23:29.780 --> 23:31.100
In Fedora 31.

23:31.100 --> 23:32.100
Smooth as butter.

23:32.100 --> 23:33.100
That's what you want.

23:33.100 --> 23:35.220
I really have been appreciating that.

23:35.220 --> 23:38.740
There is some bugs, so they're still working on it right now.

23:38.740 --> 23:44.660
You have both versions that will be available in Fedora 31 and still, if you are using the

23:44.660 --> 23:49.780
NVIDIA binary driver, Fedora Workstation 31 will disable Wayland by default right now.

23:49.780 --> 23:55.060
That's because, well, there's a lack of acceleration under X Wayland, so any application depending

23:55.060 --> 23:59.700
on GLX, like a lot of games, will just get software rendering with the binary NVIDIA

23:59.700 --> 24:00.700
driver for now.

24:00.700 --> 24:01.700
Yeah.

24:01.700 --> 24:02.700
I mean, there's not much anybody can do.

24:02.700 --> 24:03.860
It's really up to NVIDIA.

24:03.860 --> 24:08.820
They have to do that work, which it does seem like some of that is in progress.

24:08.820 --> 24:14.700
I guess they told some folks at Red Hat and on the Fedora project that there is work in

24:14.700 --> 24:15.700
progress on that.

24:15.700 --> 24:20.980
But as they write in this post, which we'll link in the show notes, we don't have a timeline

24:20.980 --> 24:26.260
yet, but it's being actively looked at and hopefully a proper date will be provided soon.

24:26.260 --> 24:28.260
A timeline for a timeline.

24:28.260 --> 24:31.180
I don't know, Les.

24:31.180 --> 24:35.540
Also just of note, if you are a daily Fedora user, you may have noticed some Sketch H.264

24:35.540 --> 24:36.540
support.

24:36.540 --> 24:39.740
Well, that's going to get a lot better in the next version of Fedora as well.

24:39.740 --> 24:40.740
Isn't that nice?

24:40.740 --> 24:42.220
I mean, boy, time's a change.

24:42.220 --> 24:43.220
Yeah, really.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.220
That is a big time changer.

24:44.220 --> 24:49.660
And then also, pipe wires, there are not a lot of changes in Fedora 31, but there will

24:49.660 --> 24:54.820
be what they're planning is major changes in 32.

24:54.820 --> 24:55.820
So take a look at it.

24:55.820 --> 24:56.820
Keep an eye out for that.

24:56.820 --> 24:57.820
Oh, boy.

24:57.820 --> 24:58.820
I guess an ear out.

24:58.820 --> 24:59.820
Keep an ear out.

24:59.820 --> 25:00.820
Yeah.

25:00.820 --> 25:01.820
Yeah.

25:01.820 --> 25:02.820
Promises to revolutionize things, maybe.

25:02.820 --> 25:03.820
Not yet.

25:03.820 --> 25:04.820
Yeah, that's what they say.

25:04.820 --> 25:07.500
Pulse audio, like we've never known it before.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.580
The end goal, like the ultimate goal, though, Les.

25:09.580 --> 25:10.580
You ready for this?

25:10.580 --> 25:13.100
Get ready, ladies and gentlemen.

25:13.100 --> 25:22.420
PipeWire will ship as the default audio handler with a way to switch back to pulse audio in

25:22.420 --> 25:23.420
Fedora 33.

25:23.420 --> 25:24.420
Okay.

25:24.420 --> 25:30.700
So I'm just going to plan to skip 33, go right to 34 on the Fedora side.

25:30.700 --> 25:34.820
Just stick with CentOS Stream if you're a Fedora user during that time, because it's

25:34.820 --> 25:37.100
going to be a bumpy ride.

25:37.100 --> 25:42.340
But a lot of work in general has gone into the performance of Gnome.3.34.

25:42.340 --> 25:47.140
It really stands out right now if you try out Ubuntu 19.10 proper.

25:47.140 --> 25:51.700
Some of that same work, because it's by some of the same folks, will land in Fedora 31.

25:51.700 --> 25:59.340
So I'm very, very, very happy as somebody who is softly trying out Gnome Shell again.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.860
That's another sign of times that have changed, right?

26:01.860 --> 26:04.100
It's a pretty nice desktop environment these days.

26:04.100 --> 26:10.340
I love this moment here towards the end of the post, again, linked in the notes.

26:10.340 --> 26:14.660
They talk about how, read that part about the great performance work there, because

26:14.660 --> 26:15.660
I just love the sentence.

26:15.660 --> 26:16.820
And I'll read the sentence after it.

26:16.820 --> 26:18.620
It's towards the bottom there.

26:18.620 --> 26:24.780
This release features a lot of great performance work by our friend Daniel von Vogt from Canonical

26:24.780 --> 26:27.820
and Georges Stravakis from Endless.

26:27.820 --> 26:30.140
Part of that was really, I just didn't want to say those names.

26:30.140 --> 26:33.220
Okay, so I like this because it's awkward for them.

26:33.220 --> 26:36.620
Because here they are, the shepherds of Gnome Shell after all this time.

26:36.620 --> 26:42.500
But the awkward situation is Canonical's come along and busted out some serious performance

26:42.500 --> 26:43.500
work.

26:43.500 --> 26:46.220
They try to often give a lot of credit to Endless, too, which they're doing some good

26:46.220 --> 26:47.220
work.

26:47.220 --> 26:48.220
But let's be honest here.

26:48.220 --> 26:49.900
A lot of it's coming from Canonical.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.860
And I love their take on it.

26:51.860 --> 26:52.860
God bless them.

26:52.860 --> 26:58.820
They write, quote, the Red Hat team has focused on providing patch review and feedback and

26:58.820 --> 27:02.700
working on bigger long term challenges and enablers.

27:02.700 --> 27:03.700
Oh, boy.

27:03.700 --> 27:04.700
Wow.

27:04.700 --> 27:06.260
I mean, that's important, too.

27:06.260 --> 27:07.420
Yeah, it is.

27:07.420 --> 27:14.700
It also sounds like they are not leading a lot of the most important and aggressive development

27:14.700 --> 27:15.980
in performance.

27:15.980 --> 27:20.020
And instead, they're just sort of sitting back and enabling.

27:20.020 --> 27:24.740
And I think you could argue, I think the definition of enabling could be argued.

27:24.740 --> 27:27.740
But it's good to see all of the collaborative work on it.

27:27.740 --> 27:32.820
And the results of that, which feels like it's been the story now for a Gnome release

27:32.820 --> 27:37.740
or a few in a row, the results of which will materialize in Gnome 3.34.

27:37.740 --> 27:38.740
Oh, boy.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.500
Get ready for that.

27:40.500 --> 27:44.300
And then last but not least, in the community news today, we have something that we need

27:44.300 --> 27:49.700
to keep on the DL, because everybody knows security through obscurity is always the best

27:49.700 --> 27:50.700
practice.

27:50.700 --> 27:51.700
That's the only way to do it.

27:51.700 --> 27:52.700
So you know what we've got to do, Wes?

27:52.700 --> 27:53.900
We've got to bust out the cone.

27:53.900 --> 27:56.900
The cone of silence.

27:56.900 --> 27:59.860
OK, just between you and me.

27:59.860 --> 28:00.860
Oh, yeah, super secret.

28:00.860 --> 28:03.300
We're going to have a big change to WireGuard.

28:03.300 --> 28:06.480
So the long and short of it is WireGuard's incredible.

28:06.480 --> 28:08.180
We're using it all the time.

28:08.180 --> 28:09.820
But it hasn't been mainlined yet.

28:09.820 --> 28:10.820
No.

28:10.820 --> 28:14.180
And it's because not enough zinc is in the Linux kernel.

28:14.180 --> 28:15.180
No.

28:15.180 --> 28:16.180
In fact, there's no zinc.

28:16.180 --> 28:17.180
No zinc at all.

28:17.180 --> 28:18.180
There's no zinc.

28:18.180 --> 28:19.180
Zinc-free kernel since.

28:19.180 --> 28:20.180
Yeah.

28:20.180 --> 28:22.180
And that is essentially the crypto that WireGuard uses.

28:22.180 --> 28:28.940
And the problem is that the upstream Linux kernel maintainers are not super keen on implementing

28:28.940 --> 28:30.780
a new kernel level crypto.

28:30.780 --> 28:34.820
They're just, I mean, especially adding it a whole bunch at once, right?

28:34.820 --> 28:39.660
And this, even though it has been audited by a third party, this has been a pain point

28:39.660 --> 28:43.060
that has prevented WireGuard from getting mainlined for multiple releases now.

28:43.060 --> 28:45.140
It's almost become a meme on this show.

28:45.140 --> 28:54.980
Well, all of this shifted on September 25, 2019, when Jason A. Dunfield, sorry, Jason.

28:54.980 --> 28:57.100
Jason, the WireGuard creator.

28:57.100 --> 29:01.600
And Jason writes, hi, folks, I'm at the Kernel Recipes conference now and got a chance to

29:01.600 --> 29:06.080
talk with Dave M., a bit about WireGuard upstreaming.

29:06.080 --> 29:08.180
His viewpoint has recently solidified.

29:08.180 --> 29:15.100
In order to go upstream, WireGuard must port to the existing crypto API and handle zinc

29:15.100 --> 29:16.980
separately.

29:16.980 --> 29:21.340
He goes on to say, I've long resisted the idea of porting to the existing crypto API

29:21.340 --> 29:26.300
because I think there are serious problems with it in terms of primitives, API performance,

29:26.300 --> 29:27.580
and overall safety.

29:27.580 --> 29:31.580
I didn't want to ship WireGuard in a form that I thought was suboptimal from a security

29:31.580 --> 29:35.580
perspective since WireGuard is a security focused project.

29:35.580 --> 29:41.880
But it seems that with us or without us, WireGuard will get ported to the existing crypto API.

29:41.880 --> 29:47.140
So it's probably better we just fully embrace it and afterwards work evolutionarily to get

29:47.140 --> 29:49.240
zinc into Linux piecemeal.

29:49.240 --> 29:54.100
He goes on to say, I've ported WireGuard already several times as a proof of concept to the

29:54.100 --> 29:59.380
API and I have a decent idea of the ways it can go wrong and generally how to do it the

29:59.380 --> 30:01.140
least bad way.

30:01.140 --> 30:02.140
All right.

30:02.140 --> 30:03.140
So let's pause here.

30:03.140 --> 30:06.060
We'll continue on for a moment because with all things Linux kernel development, there's

30:06.060 --> 30:07.060
drama with this.

30:07.060 --> 30:12.620
But before we get to the drama, let's talk about this.

30:12.620 --> 30:14.600
Holy crap.

30:14.600 --> 30:17.000
This is a huge change.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.580
Zinc is sort of part of the secret sauce of WireGuard that makes it so damn fast.

30:21.580 --> 30:27.240
And it seems to be a pretty purpose built, pretty good crypto that has been audited by

30:27.240 --> 30:28.580
a third party.

30:28.580 --> 30:34.300
So it kind of feels like we are settling for a substandard tech here just so that way we

30:34.300 --> 30:35.860
don't upset the norm.

30:35.860 --> 30:42.100
I grant that when you're dealing with security and crypto, it's a little bit different.

30:42.100 --> 30:44.820
But I'm curious to know what you think, Wes, because you and I follow this pretty closely

30:44.820 --> 30:46.300
for a little while now.

30:46.300 --> 30:51.460
Yeah, I mean, I guess one way could be to merge Zinc and then adopt change kernel features.

30:51.460 --> 30:55.740
But I think maybe a silver lining here is moving and adopting WireGuard.

30:55.740 --> 31:00.260
I imagine that there'll be a number of comments about the problems in these patch sets as

31:00.260 --> 31:05.540
they shift over and start using the existing APIs and presumably WireGuard contributors

31:05.540 --> 31:08.300
complain about the problems with those APIs.

31:08.300 --> 31:12.780
So that might see some improvements or at least help us decide how to properly bridge

31:12.780 --> 31:18.740
between what exists and Zinc because Zinc did, while it seems to be great, did have

31:18.740 --> 31:19.740
some overlap, right?

31:19.740 --> 31:24.020
It is kind of confusing to have two crypto subsystems just existence in the kernel.

31:24.020 --> 31:28.180
So I can understand some of the kernel developers reticence to just take this giant blob of

31:28.180 --> 31:30.860
code, which isn't normally really how it goes, right?

31:30.860 --> 31:32.980
They like to evolve the kernel over time.

31:32.980 --> 31:38.340
Yeah, it makes sense when you're trying to keep stability and security.

31:38.340 --> 31:40.740
I do appreciate the challenge there.

31:40.740 --> 31:44.820
Where the drama comes in is David Miller or Dave M., which in the previous post, he's

31:44.820 --> 31:47.620
the upstream maintainer of WireGuard for the Linux kernel.

31:47.620 --> 31:52.580
And he writes, whoa, quote, I didn't say, quote, must anything.

31:52.580 --> 31:57.020
I suggested this as more of a efficient way forward.

31:57.020 --> 32:01.620
I'm a bit disappointed that you felt the need to so quickly make such an explosive posting

32:01.620 --> 32:06.780
to the mailing list when we've just spoken about this amongst ourselves only 20 minutes

32:06.780 --> 32:07.780
ago.

32:07.780 --> 32:10.980
So, I mean, maybe this will or won't happen.

32:10.980 --> 32:15.140
But if that's the maintainer's view, it does sound like it might be the easiest way forward.

32:15.140 --> 32:18.420
And yeah, security is important, but at this point, I'm just tired of having to compile

32:18.420 --> 32:21.580
the module every time I update my kernel, Chris.

32:21.580 --> 32:23.500
I'm ready for a mainline WireGuard.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.460
Even with DKMS, it's not enough.

32:25.460 --> 32:31.340
Before you press send on any email and you're feeling emotional, just take five, you know?

32:31.340 --> 32:37.660
Yeah, in fact, Jason, the WireGuard developer writes back and says, explosive?

32:37.660 --> 32:38.900
That's certainly not the intent here.

32:38.900 --> 32:42.340
The project is changing direction in a big way.

32:42.340 --> 32:45.860
Collaborating with others on the crypto API will be an important part of that.

32:45.860 --> 32:50.820
Announcing that change in direction, those intentions and rationale and why will be okay.

32:50.820 --> 32:56.060
And then inviting collaboration is a responsible thing to do in the earliest opportunity.

32:56.060 --> 33:01.980
Better to announce intent early rather than surprise people or deter potential collaborators

33:01.980 --> 33:03.460
by keeping plans secret.

33:03.460 --> 33:04.820
I kind of agree in this case.

33:04.820 --> 33:07.820
I wonder, is this just a, you know, communication breakdown?

33:07.820 --> 33:11.460
People normally speak over email and there is a kind of a, you know, it's difficult to

33:11.460 --> 33:14.100
get the kernel to accept your, accept your work.

33:14.100 --> 33:17.700
Seems like maybe Dave was having a conversation and Jason took that as a little more final

33:17.700 --> 33:19.420
than Dave really meant it to be.

33:19.420 --> 33:22.940
Well, and if you're going to rip out one of the, if you're going to just yank out zinc,

33:22.940 --> 33:26.100
which is a key differentiator of that product, you probably want to give people a heads up

33:26.100 --> 33:27.700
as fast as possible.

33:27.700 --> 33:31.060
There's that too.

33:31.060 --> 33:32.160
That's the community news.

33:32.160 --> 33:35.860
So let's do a little housekeeping because we have some big things coming up.

33:35.860 --> 33:38.660
AugCamp 19, just around the corner.

33:38.660 --> 33:40.340
Mr. Wimpress will be there, won't you Wimpy?

33:40.340 --> 33:41.520
I certainly will.

33:41.520 --> 33:44.100
I'm looking forward to hearing everything that happens.

33:44.100 --> 33:45.100
I am very jelly.

33:45.100 --> 33:50.700
I'm not going, but Mr. Joe Resington will be there and there will be a panel, a podcast

33:50.700 --> 33:51.700
panel.

33:51.700 --> 33:53.340
That sounds like something we might like.

33:53.340 --> 33:56.180
We got a theme going this episode with the alliteration.

33:56.180 --> 34:01.420
It includes several of your internet favorites out there and they need your questions.

34:01.420 --> 34:04.140
So we'll have a link about that in the show notes if you're in the area and you want to

34:04.140 --> 34:05.140
hear several of your favorites.

34:05.140 --> 34:06.140
Yeah.

34:06.140 --> 34:07.140
You got questions for them.

34:07.140 --> 34:08.140
Things you've always been dying to know.

34:08.140 --> 34:09.140
Whatever they are.

34:09.140 --> 34:10.140
Now's the time.

34:10.140 --> 34:11.140
Let's get started.

34:11.140 --> 34:12.140
Hosted by the internet's own Joe Resington.

34:12.140 --> 34:13.140
Yeah.

34:13.140 --> 34:15.900
See, that's the problem is he's not going to be answering the questions and that's,

34:15.900 --> 34:17.260
that's what I want to ask.

34:17.260 --> 34:18.260
That's true.

34:18.260 --> 34:19.900
He is good at asking the questions though.

34:19.900 --> 34:20.900
Oh, very good.

34:20.900 --> 34:21.900
Hey, guess what?

34:21.900 --> 34:23.380
New month, new free courses.

34:23.380 --> 34:26.580
Elle just released a whole new batch of community courses.

34:26.580 --> 34:28.980
The October free courses are here.

34:28.980 --> 34:31.620
The big post is up over on the Linux Academy blog.

34:31.620 --> 34:35.040
We have Alinkskies as always, but you can find it there as well.

34:35.040 --> 34:39.060
There is a bunch of good stuff to get in there, including database administration and SQL

34:39.060 --> 34:40.900
language basics.

34:40.900 --> 34:44.500
If that's something you've struggled with before, Ansible playbook, deep dive.

34:44.500 --> 34:48.980
If you need to learn Ansible and if you're wrapping your head around databases for the

34:48.980 --> 34:52.500
first time, database essentials would be perfect for you.

34:52.500 --> 34:55.860
There's also some stuff in there for Azure, Azure command line essentials and other free

34:55.860 --> 34:56.860
courses.

34:56.860 --> 34:59.500
And of course the community account is free as well.

34:59.500 --> 35:02.220
Elle goes through and curates those every single month.

35:02.220 --> 35:04.860
There's some that are persistent and some that are brand new every month.

35:04.860 --> 35:05.860
I love that.

35:05.860 --> 35:08.640
You know, it's kind of, we kind of get to sneak in there and take this content normally

35:08.640 --> 35:12.020
costs money and boom, boom, free.

35:12.020 --> 35:14.100
Wes and I are traveling next week.

35:14.100 --> 35:17.940
We're going down to Texas cyber summit where we'll meet up with Al and Cheezy.

35:17.940 --> 35:18.940
Oh yeah.

35:18.940 --> 35:19.940
Oh yeah.

35:19.940 --> 35:20.940
It's going to be a good show.

35:20.940 --> 35:22.260
Texas cyber summit 2019.

35:22.260 --> 35:24.460
You can win tickets.

35:24.460 --> 35:25.820
We have a new winner, don't we?

35:25.820 --> 35:28.360
Enrique is our latest winner.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.620
We have two tickets left.

35:30.620 --> 35:34.540
I think Al plans on giving out one of those tickets tomorrow.

35:34.540 --> 35:38.620
Not sure exactly what time, but to enter, all you have to do is join the telegram.

35:38.620 --> 35:46.660
Group, which is TCS2019.ellopunk.com link in the notes, join us and, uh, you'll be entered

35:46.660 --> 35:47.660
to win.

35:47.660 --> 35:51.140
And if you don't, if you can't come, you know, but, uh, we pick your name and we're going

35:51.140 --> 35:53.180
to send out a little swag pack to you.

35:53.180 --> 35:57.740
Um, so looking forward to seeing everybody there and it's, it seems to be stacking up.

35:57.740 --> 36:05.220
I mean, I've, I've seen, uh, five or six people now from just the Texas, uh, Linux fest crew

36:05.220 --> 36:06.220
that are showing up.

36:06.220 --> 36:10.180
So it ought to be a really, uh, really interesting turnout and could be a good way to get a swag

36:10.180 --> 36:11.180
back.

36:11.180 --> 36:12.180
Absolutely.

36:12.180 --> 36:17.420
And then of course, uh, there'll be the hacker family dinner and L and Allie's un-birthday

36:17.420 --> 36:20.040
party at two brothers barbecue.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.040
So join us for that.

36:21.040 --> 36:25.300
We'll all sit down and have some barbecue and hang out, you know, do what we do in Texas,

36:25.300 --> 36:26.300
right?

36:26.300 --> 36:30.780
West and I land like the bosses that we are kind of late.

36:30.780 --> 36:33.700
So if you want to come and see West and I angle towards the end of the dinner, we're

36:33.700 --> 36:35.820
going to roll straight from the airport to the dinner.

36:35.820 --> 36:36.820
We are.

36:36.820 --> 36:37.820
Indeed.

36:37.820 --> 36:38.820
We're going to be hungry.

36:38.820 --> 36:39.820
You know?

36:39.820 --> 36:40.820
Yeah.

36:40.820 --> 36:41.820
We're going to want to eat the crap out of that barbecues.

36:41.820 --> 36:42.820
We'll be on the plane all day long.

36:42.820 --> 36:43.820
Okay.

36:43.820 --> 36:46.780
Or you go early, we'll meet you there and then just make sure there's a lot of barbecue

36:46.780 --> 36:47.780
already there.

36:47.780 --> 36:48.780
Yeah.

36:48.780 --> 36:49.780
Well, and then Carl, I think has vetted the barbecue.

36:49.780 --> 36:52.260
He ate there like twice in one week.

36:52.260 --> 36:53.260
It's Carl approved.

36:53.260 --> 36:54.260
So wow.

36:54.260 --> 36:55.260
That's a selfless act.

36:55.260 --> 36:56.260
Isn't it?

36:56.260 --> 36:57.260
It can't be that bad.

36:57.260 --> 37:01.460
Just doing what I got to do, man.

37:01.460 --> 37:05.500
So the unofficial hacker family dinner and un-birthday party, Wednesday, October 9th in

37:05.500 --> 37:09.460
San Antonio details at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

37:09.460 --> 37:13.420
Even if you're listening to this show after the fact, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

37:13.420 --> 37:17.540
is worth keeping your eye on because that is where we announce that kind of stuff and

37:17.540 --> 37:19.980
we will do future meetups as well.

37:19.980 --> 37:21.660
Let's check that out.

37:21.660 --> 37:22.660
Texas in October.

37:22.660 --> 37:23.660
There's worse places to go.

37:23.660 --> 37:24.660
We'll see you there.

37:24.660 --> 37:25.660
All right.

37:25.660 --> 37:31.420
I have a question for everybody as we get into this part of the show, we're going to

37:31.420 --> 37:34.420
get into our first steps after an install to make it just right.

37:34.420 --> 37:39.340
But I'm curious to know how old y'all's install is right now.

37:39.340 --> 37:42.780
Mr. Payne, we have a couple of commands that we'll link to in the show notes, but you ran

37:42.780 --> 37:44.500
the old command skis there on your machine.

37:44.500 --> 37:46.260
How old is your install right now?

37:46.260 --> 37:50.060
I am one week away from a year with Neon.

37:50.060 --> 37:51.060
All right.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.060
Yeah.

37:52.060 --> 37:53.060
Isn't that fun?

37:53.060 --> 37:56.180
So actually while we're at the cyber summit, it'll be my Neon anniversary.

37:56.180 --> 37:57.180
That's not bad.

37:57.180 --> 37:59.480
I'm thinking that makes it a perfect time to mix things up too.

37:59.480 --> 38:00.480
Now I've done my year.

38:00.480 --> 38:01.480
I can say that I've tried it.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.480
I've given it an honest try.

38:02.480 --> 38:03.480
Right.

38:03.480 --> 38:04.480
Time to change.

38:04.480 --> 38:05.480
Yeah.

38:05.480 --> 38:06.480
Maybe it'll happen.

38:06.480 --> 38:08.700
I bet somebody in the chat room will have a longer install date.

38:08.700 --> 38:14.300
So chat room, feel free now to reveal your install dates in the chat room.

38:14.300 --> 38:18.540
You can check my Twitter feed if you need a command on how to check your date.

38:18.540 --> 38:21.060
Wimpy, have you ran this command?

38:21.060 --> 38:23.380
Have you checked the, it's the current install you're on.

38:23.380 --> 38:25.980
I mean, everybody has older installs, but the machine you're on right now.

38:25.980 --> 38:26.980
Yeah.

38:26.980 --> 38:31.080
So I'm in an interesting position in that I built this computer earlier in the year.

38:31.080 --> 38:37.380
So my install date is March the 3rd, 2019, but that's days after I actually finished

38:37.380 --> 38:39.540
building this brand new computer.

38:39.540 --> 38:41.100
A nice fresh machine.

38:41.100 --> 38:44.380
It's been upgraded through three versions of Ubuntu in that time.

38:44.380 --> 38:49.460
So it was installed with 1810, it was upgraded to 1904 and it's now running 1910.

38:49.460 --> 38:50.460
Naturally.

38:50.460 --> 38:52.500
Of course, of course.

38:52.500 --> 38:59.820
The system I'm sitting at here in the studio was installed on January 29th, 2018, which

38:59.820 --> 39:01.260
is pretty good for us.

39:01.260 --> 39:02.260
That's pretty good.

39:02.260 --> 39:03.260
That is actually pretty good.

39:03.260 --> 39:04.260
Mm-hmm.

39:04.260 --> 39:11.940
My machine upstairs is February, 2018, 2018, 1804 was a game changer for me.

39:11.940 --> 39:18.740
That was the OS that I just, I rebased every workstation I have on.

39:18.740 --> 39:23.620
And the ones I installed, all these machines in the studio have the same install date because

39:23.620 --> 39:24.620
they were all done on that day.

39:24.620 --> 39:28.140
You know, there's something kind of enjoyable, I don't know if it's just because we've done

39:28.140 --> 39:33.740
it for so long or the sort of spirit of installing Linux, but we don't even need to reinstall

39:33.740 --> 39:34.740
that often, right?

39:34.740 --> 39:38.660
I mean, like employees upgrades have gotten to be pretty darn good now.

39:38.660 --> 39:42.580
And there are many times there's no problems with my machine, it's just fun to wipe it

39:42.580 --> 39:44.160
and set it all up again.

39:44.160 --> 39:47.600
And also installing Linux now is just so darned easy.

39:47.600 --> 39:48.600
And quick.

39:48.600 --> 39:49.600
That's true.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.980
Alex, did you check the install date there on your machine?

39:51.980 --> 39:55.120
Well, so I have two SSDs in the system.

39:55.120 --> 39:59.580
So this Arch install is about three or four weeks old because I bought a new boot SSD,

39:59.580 --> 40:04.340
but the Arch install before it, which technically is still bootable, which I'm going to count

40:04.340 --> 40:06.100
is about 18 months old.

40:06.100 --> 40:07.100
Okay.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.100
Okay.

40:08.100 --> 40:10.620
I think, I think we're going to find is the majority have pretty new installs.

40:10.620 --> 40:11.620
I don't know what that says about us.

40:11.620 --> 40:12.620
What about you Cheesy?

40:12.620 --> 40:14.580
Did you have a chance to check the date of your install?

40:14.580 --> 40:15.580
Yeah.

40:15.580 --> 40:22.820
So my old MacBook that's running Pop OS was refreshed May 11th of 2019.

40:22.820 --> 40:29.260
And then I've actually got the beta for Matei pulled down and I plan on putting on a test

40:29.260 --> 40:30.260
machine later too.

40:30.260 --> 40:34.380
So for me, it's one of those things that I always jump around, you know, just to see

40:34.380 --> 40:35.380
what's out there.

40:35.380 --> 40:36.380
And I don't know.

40:36.380 --> 40:39.980
I mean, I guess I could check some raspberry pies around the house.

40:39.980 --> 40:42.000
I'm sure they would have an older install date.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.740
This is why WestK execs everywhere.

40:43.740 --> 40:46.860
ByteBin, did you have a chance to check the date on your install?

40:46.860 --> 40:52.140
Yeah, I seem to have a two year old and two months old install.

40:52.140 --> 40:53.400
That's not bad.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.140
That's actually pretty, pretty dang good.

40:55.140 --> 40:56.140
What distro is that?

40:56.140 --> 40:57.140
Solus.

40:57.140 --> 41:00.780
I did not expect that.

41:00.780 --> 41:01.780
Very nice.

41:01.780 --> 41:03.780
But a nice one also.

41:03.780 --> 41:11.180
I guess what was discussed on Jupiter broadcasting about two years and two months ago.

41:11.180 --> 41:12.180
I'm going to say Solus.

41:12.180 --> 41:13.180
I love that.

41:13.180 --> 41:14.180
That's so great.

41:14.180 --> 41:16.740
What about you, Brent?

41:16.740 --> 41:18.820
Did you get a chance to check your workhorse?

41:18.820 --> 41:22.140
Well, that lovely command you gave me didn't work because I'm on Arch, I guess, but I did

41:22.140 --> 41:33.060
find a Cinchy file date and it corroborates with my memory, which is 2017 0314.

41:33.060 --> 41:35.580
So that's kind of old.

41:35.580 --> 41:36.580
Whoa.

41:36.580 --> 41:37.580
Whoa.

41:37.580 --> 41:43.940
And you're living proof that you can drive Arch daily.

41:43.940 --> 41:44.940
Anybody else?

41:44.940 --> 41:46.940
Can anybody else beat 2017?

41:46.940 --> 41:49.620
I bet you that's the oldest install.

41:49.620 --> 41:50.620
I can beat it.

41:50.620 --> 41:56.860
I'm still on 1604, so it's 30th of June.

41:56.860 --> 42:02.420
It's my desktop and my Windows environment is enlightenment, so I compiled it myself

42:02.420 --> 42:03.420
on GitHub.

42:03.420 --> 42:09.020
The software I need, I get some snaps and some PPAs, so why not?

42:09.020 --> 42:10.900
We're only talking desktops here, right?

42:10.900 --> 42:15.820
For the purposes of this, I'm thinking we're talking whatever machine you're sitting in

42:15.820 --> 42:19.980
front of right now, because we've all got like maybe old boxes in a closet somewhere.

42:19.980 --> 42:23.500
What I was wondering if you still had a droplet running Arch, West, can you get into that

42:23.500 --> 42:24.500
box?

42:24.500 --> 42:25.500
Yeah.

42:25.500 --> 42:26.500
That would be fascinating.

42:26.500 --> 42:28.500
West will attempt to get into that box.

42:28.500 --> 42:29.500
That's a great, great question.

42:29.500 --> 42:32.380
I have an idea from one time I looked.

42:32.380 --> 42:33.380
We'll see.

42:33.380 --> 42:34.380
We'll see.

42:34.380 --> 42:36.420
Anybody else in the mumble room have a chance to check the date on their install?

42:36.420 --> 42:37.420
Yeah.

42:37.420 --> 42:42.740
Mine was Thursday, June 6th of this year on Ferran OS because I've been testing different

42:42.740 --> 42:46.220
distros and it's on a new computer I built.

42:46.220 --> 42:48.660
And you stuck with Ferran for a little bit now?

42:48.660 --> 42:49.660
Yeah.

42:49.660 --> 42:50.660
Well, I actually have three.

42:50.660 --> 42:55.820
I have Ferran OS, Pop OS, and Ubuntu 18.04 on this machine.

42:55.820 --> 42:58.140
So you're just distro hopping every day.

42:58.140 --> 42:59.140
Yeah.

42:59.140 --> 43:01.940
Some of us distro hop every few months.

43:01.940 --> 43:03.660
Jill, she distro hops every day.

43:03.660 --> 43:04.660
Yeah.

43:04.660 --> 43:05.660
Okay.

43:05.660 --> 43:06.660
Here we go.

43:06.660 --> 43:07.660
All right.

43:07.660 --> 43:08.660
The results are in.

43:08.660 --> 43:09.660
Hold on.

43:09.660 --> 43:10.660
Hold on.

43:10.660 --> 43:11.660
You want to build a little suspense for this?

43:11.660 --> 43:12.660
Here we go.

43:12.660 --> 43:15.200
The box in the cloud running JBOT.

43:15.200 --> 43:16.620
Which crashed during the show.

43:16.620 --> 43:17.620
I will note.

43:17.620 --> 43:18.620
Yes.

43:18.620 --> 43:23.620
The file system was created Monday, April 1st, 2013.

43:23.620 --> 43:24.620
Yes.

43:24.620 --> 43:25.620
Yeah.

43:25.620 --> 43:26.620
Wow.

43:26.620 --> 43:27.620
Cool.

43:27.620 --> 43:28.620
Whoa.

43:28.620 --> 43:32.440
You can't run a rolling distro on a server though.

43:32.440 --> 43:34.140
You cannot do it.

43:34.140 --> 43:35.420
It just won't work.

43:35.420 --> 43:40.780
It just won't work, especially not one that has a network and that is running server services.

43:40.780 --> 43:41.780
You cannot do it.

43:41.780 --> 43:44.460
I don't know about that, but you do certainly have to keep up with the update.

43:44.460 --> 43:45.460
You do.

43:45.460 --> 43:49.820
We haven't always been super great about that because one of the challenges is the Digital

43:49.820 --> 43:51.820
Ocean pinned the kernel.

43:51.820 --> 43:56.740
So that was a little bit tricky to work around and keeping it up to date meant that we eventually

43:56.740 --> 44:00.380
broke the networking stack so it doesn't auto start when the system loads.

44:00.380 --> 44:04.980
So it hasn't been perfect, but it has worked.

44:04.980 --> 44:07.820
I think we're going to migrate off of that and just containerize that whole thing and

44:07.820 --> 44:09.180
then throw it on something else.

44:09.180 --> 44:12.520
But it almost seems like a fun challenge to take someone who thinks they're really good

44:12.520 --> 44:15.260
or wants to learn Arch and then we'll let them upgrade it and see if they can get it

44:15.260 --> 44:16.260
working from here.

44:16.260 --> 44:17.260
It really is.

44:17.260 --> 44:22.220
So that install date is impressive, but I hate to do this.

44:22.220 --> 44:23.220
Uh-oh.

44:23.220 --> 44:24.220
Hold on.

44:24.220 --> 44:25.220
Can I do this?

44:25.220 --> 44:26.220
Hold on.

44:26.220 --> 44:27.220
I'll do this.

44:27.220 --> 44:28.220
All right.

44:28.220 --> 44:29.220
Go ahead, Wimpy, with the reveal.

44:29.220 --> 44:38.980
The UbuntuPodcast.org server was installed in February 2006 and has been dist-upgraded

44:38.980 --> 44:45.740
from 6.06 to 18.04 to 12.04 and is currently running 14.04 on ESM.

44:45.740 --> 44:46.740
Wow.

44:46.740 --> 44:49.780
That's a case study right there.

44:49.780 --> 44:50.780
Right there.

44:50.780 --> 44:52.740
You write that up as a case study.

44:52.740 --> 44:54.700
That's a scientific experiment.

44:54.700 --> 44:56.180
All right.

44:56.180 --> 44:59.300
Well, that was a lot of fun.

44:59.300 --> 45:03.140
So let's talk about what we do once we reload these machines because you can see we have

45:03.140 --> 45:04.140
a mix here.

45:04.140 --> 45:05.140
This is really fascinating.

45:05.140 --> 45:09.480
We have the old boxes, and we also have some very, very fresh systems.

45:09.480 --> 45:14.780
And I'm thinking my workstation upstairs is due for a reload.

45:14.780 --> 45:19.460
It's been around since 2018, which isn't super long.

45:19.460 --> 45:22.620
But I have desktop hopped instead of distro hop.

45:22.620 --> 45:28.460
I love having all my stuff set up, my SSH keys, my GPG keys, all my configs.

45:28.460 --> 45:32.700
And I've worked on exporting that out and making it synced or whatever.

45:32.700 --> 45:34.780
But it took a while to get there.

45:34.780 --> 45:44.100
And so in the meantime, I switched from Plasma to Gnome Shell to XFCE, and they got a lot

45:44.100 --> 45:45.100
of baggage.

45:45.100 --> 45:50.460
So I thought in the next round of releases come out, it's probably time to do a clean

45:50.460 --> 45:51.460
install.

45:51.460 --> 45:56.860
And I've thought about maybe using this as an opportunity to automate aspects of this.

45:56.860 --> 46:00.540
That's something that I've talked to Alex about and something I've talked to Wes about,

46:00.540 --> 46:06.140
trying to really go to the next level of making it a more efficient process.

46:06.140 --> 46:08.780
So right now, I'll tell you guys what I do right now.

46:08.780 --> 46:12.780
My current workflow is I get a new box, I get it installed.

46:12.780 --> 46:15.780
First thing I got to do is I got to install Nextcloud and Syncthing.

46:15.780 --> 46:20.500
Nextcloud for my work stuff, Syncthing for my personal stuff and my notes.

46:20.500 --> 46:24.980
Then I got to get Firefox and Chrome, which I also then set up their respective syncing

46:24.980 --> 46:25.980
services.

46:25.980 --> 46:29.820
A lot of this stuff is pulling down configuration that's been stored off site.

46:29.820 --> 46:33.540
So already you've got a whole bunch of files and all your browser stuff ready to go.

46:33.540 --> 46:34.540
So that wasn't too bad.

46:34.540 --> 46:40.820
Then I try to do things like I tweak my terminal size to make sure it's not really annoyingly

46:40.820 --> 46:41.940
narrow.

46:41.940 --> 46:44.580
I get gnome-tweak installed if I'm on Gnome Shell.

46:44.580 --> 46:46.540
I install Fish Shell.

46:46.540 --> 46:49.100
I add the minimize and maximize buttons to Gnome Shell if I got to.

46:49.100 --> 46:50.380
I configure Dash to Dock.

46:50.380 --> 46:53.220
If I'm on XFCE, I'll probably install ULauncher.

46:53.220 --> 46:55.540
Got to set up a dark theme, obviously, get to that.

46:55.540 --> 47:02.460
Then I got to get my comms up, so I get Telegram, Slack, Mattermost, and email set up and configured.

47:02.460 --> 47:07.260
Then if I'm on a desktop system, I've generally got what I call slash big, which I just take

47:07.260 --> 47:13.260
a huge disk or like a J-Bot of disks and I just assign it to slash big, and that's where

47:13.260 --> 47:14.580
like my project scratch is.

47:14.580 --> 47:20.220
So if I want to do some drone footage or need to backup 15 distros off of Usenet and extract

47:20.220 --> 47:23.340
them, that's where I have that space to just do something like that.

47:23.340 --> 47:27.380
And if it's a laptop, I'm generally always now deploying WireGuard.

47:27.380 --> 47:31.100
I'm always getting WireGuard set up and configured to link back to the studio.

47:31.100 --> 47:35.940
And this is probably the things I do in like the first couple of hours of a new machine.

47:35.940 --> 47:40.540
And I feel like some of these things could probably be automated, like the packages for

47:40.540 --> 47:44.020
tasks, things like that could be done ahead of time.

47:44.020 --> 47:49.220
We were just talking about the potential of like the systemd new portable home directory

47:49.220 --> 47:51.740
idea, and that would fix some of this, not all.

47:51.740 --> 47:54.900
So there's a kind of interesting split, right, you have some that's just like your user stuff,

47:54.900 --> 47:58.300
it lives in your home, it's configuration for small applications, and you've got the

47:58.300 --> 48:02.120
other part where you need to actually configure the system and make sure all the tools you

48:02.120 --> 48:03.120
need are available.

48:03.120 --> 48:07.840
All right, so let's see what folks in the virtual log are doing to see if they've solved

48:07.840 --> 48:08.840
this problem.

48:08.840 --> 48:12.980
MiniMech, do you have certain fundamentals you've got to go with and have you automated

48:12.980 --> 48:14.180
their setup?

48:14.180 --> 48:16.260
If you do, what are they and have you automated them?

48:16.260 --> 48:21.820
I have not automated them, but on the desktop, it would be the mouse configuration, it will

48:21.820 --> 48:28.740
be two programs, which is EMWheel and Easy Stroke, which is the mouse configuration for

48:28.740 --> 48:34.660
scrolling wheels, tilt, left, right, and everything, because they are so crucial in my workflow.

48:34.660 --> 48:42.260
Afterwards, installing software is easy, but to use the desktop, I'm so used to these two

48:42.260 --> 48:45.220
programs that I can't leave, I can't miss them.

48:45.220 --> 48:47.500
I know what you mean, I totally know what you mean.

48:47.500 --> 48:50.860
I'm like that with you, Launcher, on Xfce, I got to have it.

48:50.860 --> 48:55.260
Technav, if I recall, you have scripted some of this stuff for your got-to-haves.

48:55.260 --> 49:01.500
The programs I find that I use often, basically, I just wrote a simple batch script that just

49:01.500 --> 49:08.980
adds the necessary repositories, installs items, install Node and so forth, and once

49:08.980 --> 49:13.260
it gets through, pretty much I have most of what I need installed, and then from there,

49:13.260 --> 49:15.620
as I find new things, I just add on.

49:15.620 --> 49:19.940
You have a living batch script, essentially, that you add applications or version changes

49:19.940 --> 49:25.140
to, and then you just back that up and restore that, and that seems like a pretty good approach.

49:25.140 --> 49:27.300
And that might be the hardest part for you, I think, right?

49:27.300 --> 49:30.540
Because if you're going to do this, you either need a time to audit your past system and

49:30.540 --> 49:34.880
note what you need to actually add into your automation, or remember to update your automation

49:34.880 --> 49:37.140
each time you need to go make a change to your system.

49:37.140 --> 49:42.180
Or what's even more tricky, like desktops, Ubuntu, laptops, Fedora right now.

49:42.180 --> 49:44.300
And that gets a little messy.

49:44.300 --> 49:46.660
Alex, is this where you tell me I should use Ansible?

49:46.660 --> 49:48.140
Absolutely, it is.

49:48.140 --> 49:49.140
Yeah.

49:49.140 --> 49:52.500
Something Wes just said there struck a chord with me as well.

49:52.500 --> 49:57.420
So one of the principles I try to follow is something called infrastructure as code.

49:57.420 --> 50:02.900
And what this means is every single change you make, no matter how inconsequential, you

50:02.900 --> 50:04.060
make through automation.

50:04.060 --> 50:10.520
So everything lives in Git, every change is applied via Ansible, or any other config management

50:10.520 --> 50:12.980
tool, it doesn't have to be Ansible.

50:12.980 --> 50:17.260
So let's say you're updating your Samba config file and you want to change a single character,

50:17.260 --> 50:23.180
you change that file, commit it to Git, run the automation, or in a perfect world, there

50:23.180 --> 50:28.220
is some continuous integration server like Jenkins or something else doing it.

50:28.220 --> 50:32.420
And that works really well for servers, but for the desktop, it's possibly a little overkill.

50:32.420 --> 50:38.280
What if you are from a Windows background from yesteryear, like a roaming profile.

50:38.280 --> 50:44.520
So I restore that to my freshly installed machine, and I instantaneously have all of

50:44.520 --> 50:52.580
my configuration applied, all of my SSH keys, my VPN configuration, just everything is enabled.

50:52.580 --> 50:58.120
And I'm immediately in my familiar environment, you know, using the fish shell rather than

50:58.120 --> 50:59.840
bash and all of that stuff.

50:59.840 --> 51:04.780
So Martin, that sort of stuff sounds really appealing until I think to myself, well, what

51:04.780 --> 51:06.540
was the reason I reloaded this box?

51:06.540 --> 51:11.460
Was it to fix a screw up I made, or was it just to feel like I'm wearing a new pair of

51:11.460 --> 51:12.460
shoes?

51:12.460 --> 51:14.580
You know, that wonderful new shoe feeling.

51:14.580 --> 51:16.100
Sometimes I don't want to bring all that crud with me.

51:16.100 --> 51:17.220
How do you handle that?

51:17.220 --> 51:22.000
So Yadim is basically an interface that sits on top of Git.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.460
So it doesn't just check everything in that you do.

51:25.460 --> 51:31.380
You can selectively choose what you're checking into your portfolio of config and what have

51:31.380 --> 51:32.380
you.

51:32.380 --> 51:37.140
Just like Git, if you do check something in and you don't like it, you can revert it.

51:37.140 --> 51:42.780
So you know, you've got exactly the same semantics that Git has with Yadim in order to control

51:42.780 --> 51:44.680
what's in your profile.

51:44.680 --> 51:47.000
So it's very flexible.

51:47.000 --> 51:54.220
And then the other thing I use is a thing called direnv, which is direnv.net.

51:54.220 --> 51:56.860
And that's from the Nix project.

51:56.860 --> 52:03.400
And that's a mechanism by which I have projects in different directory structures and it automatically

52:03.400 --> 52:09.520
switches my environment context based on the directory I'm in.

52:09.520 --> 52:16.700
So when I'm in my development Debian directory, all of my GPG signing keys and email addresses

52:16.700 --> 52:20.660
and things that are used, you know, when you're packaging for Debian are all automatically

52:20.660 --> 52:22.100
switched to that context.

52:22.100 --> 52:27.700
And likewise, when I move to development Ubuntu, it all switches to development or development

52:27.700 --> 52:29.520
multi-desktop and so on.

52:29.520 --> 52:33.900
And that's a way to sort of not have to go through that craft each time.

52:33.900 --> 52:38.900
You just as you switch between projects, your world just reflects, you know, what and where

52:38.900 --> 52:39.900
you're working.

52:39.900 --> 52:40.900
It's beautiful.

52:40.900 --> 52:41.900
That is so beautiful.

52:41.900 --> 52:45.100
That's what I love about our Mumble Room.

52:45.100 --> 52:50.660
You know, this is, it's really like the wisdom of the community here.

52:50.660 --> 52:53.180
That's really great.

52:53.180 --> 52:57.820
I feel like I have so much to learn when it comes to this.

52:57.820 --> 53:01.260
I just, part of me loves trying it differently every time, too.

53:01.260 --> 53:05.540
So that's a bit of my resistance, but I think I'm getting past that.

53:05.540 --> 53:10.540
I think that era is coming to an end, but Carl, you use Ansible on the desktop, don't

53:10.540 --> 53:11.540
you?

53:11.540 --> 53:12.540
Yes, sir.

53:12.540 --> 53:15.820
Ansible has a deconf module that comes in real handy when you're trying to automate

53:15.820 --> 53:19.940
gnome settings and it even works for gnome extensions and also for mate mate too.

53:19.940 --> 53:20.940
All right.

53:20.940 --> 53:21.940
I'm sold.

53:21.940 --> 53:22.940
All right.

53:22.940 --> 53:23.940
All right.

53:23.940 --> 53:24.940
That's incredible.

53:24.940 --> 53:25.940
I didn't realize that.

53:25.940 --> 53:26.940
Okay.

53:26.940 --> 53:27.940
That kind of makes a lot of sense.

53:27.940 --> 53:30.100
This is something I'm going to invest some time in because I'm getting deeper and deeper

53:30.100 --> 53:34.620
into setting up services on the LAN and it's getting to a point now where it's not a lot

53:34.620 --> 53:39.420
of machines, but it is a lot of containers to manage and I could really, really, really

53:39.420 --> 53:43.940
use a simple way to just get everything stood right back up if something were to fail on

53:43.940 --> 53:44.940
it.

53:44.940 --> 53:48.380
It's kind of fun when you're doing it bespoke each time on your laptop, but when it's things

53:48.380 --> 53:51.580
you actually need just as a functional device, well, it gets old fast.

53:51.580 --> 53:53.820
So Chris, imagine this as a panacea.

53:53.820 --> 54:00.640
You know that lovely Pi 4 that you have running WireGuard on there connecting to each network

54:00.640 --> 54:04.080
that you have at the studio in the RV.

54:04.080 --> 54:07.700
Maybe if you are in Texas, you have a couple of machines down there, right?

54:07.700 --> 54:12.940
And you can push a change to all of your machines with a single command using Ansible over WireGuard.

54:12.940 --> 54:13.940
Wouldn't that be amazing?

54:13.940 --> 54:14.940
Yes.

54:14.940 --> 54:16.860
Oh, I want to do that.

54:16.860 --> 54:17.860
Can I do that?

54:17.860 --> 54:18.860
Is there anything I can do, Alex?

54:18.860 --> 54:19.860
We can do that.

54:19.860 --> 54:24.900
Yeah, that sounds like the territory of the self-hosted show in the near future.

54:24.900 --> 54:30.820
I've been building some really amazing services and infrastructure on freaking Raspberry Pi

54:30.820 --> 54:31.820
4s, to be clear.

54:31.820 --> 54:34.380
I would never have believed it.

54:34.380 --> 54:35.380
I wouldn't have either, Wes.

54:35.380 --> 54:37.740
I really, truly wouldn't have.

54:37.740 --> 54:41.820
And we're going to talk a little about my setup on the self-hosted show, but that stuff

54:41.820 --> 54:46.180
has really gotten me thinking about just biting this automation bullet, just solving this

54:46.180 --> 54:47.180
problem once and for all.

54:47.180 --> 54:50.740
It's something I've been putting off for a ridiculously long time.

54:50.740 --> 54:51.820
I just got to solve it.

54:51.820 --> 54:53.540
We'll drag you into this century yet.

54:53.540 --> 54:54.540
Come on in.

54:54.540 --> 54:55.540
The water's lovely and warm.

54:55.540 --> 55:00.260
I refuse, and that's why Cheese has the perfect app pick for me this week.

55:00.260 --> 55:04.860
It's Telegram, but in Python and on the console.

55:04.860 --> 55:05.860
Yeah.

55:05.860 --> 55:12.440
So before I had consolidated everything into the cloud, I was running a lot of the stuff

55:12.440 --> 55:18.980
on single-board computers, and so I would just SSH into the box and Curses all the

55:18.980 --> 55:19.980
things.

55:19.980 --> 55:23.900
So TTY clock, and Curses Telegram client.

55:23.900 --> 55:26.900
So if you want to get your Telegram on, you can do that.

55:26.900 --> 55:33.980
It even appears to have some awesome ASCII art instead of photos.

55:33.980 --> 55:36.660
So the photos will be displayed in ASCII art.

55:36.660 --> 55:37.660
Yeah.

55:37.660 --> 55:38.660
Inline images, kind of.

55:38.660 --> 55:39.660
Yeah.

55:39.660 --> 55:40.660
Which is great, man.

55:40.660 --> 55:41.660
You've got to love that.

55:41.660 --> 55:45.980
So if you're looking for just a simple way to tie into your Telegram and get your Telegram

55:45.980 --> 55:48.220
fix on the command line, check it out.

55:48.220 --> 55:50.500
Something tells me Levi looks cute even in ASCII.

55:50.500 --> 55:51.580
I bet you that's true.

55:51.580 --> 55:52.580
I guarantee it.

55:52.580 --> 55:53.580
All right.

55:53.580 --> 55:57.740
And then for a bonus pick round, Mr. Martin Wimpress is coming in with a bonus app pick

55:57.740 --> 55:58.740
this week.

55:58.740 --> 55:59.740
What is it, Wimpy?

55:59.740 --> 56:03.400
So my app pick is CPUX.

56:03.400 --> 56:07.500
So are any of you familiar with CPUZ on Windows?

56:07.500 --> 56:12.020
Is that like the tool that gives you all of the cool information about your CPU?

56:12.020 --> 56:13.020
Yes.

56:13.020 --> 56:22.660
So CPUX is basically CPUZ for Linux, and I'll paste links in the IRC in just a moment.

56:22.660 --> 56:24.120
It's been around for a while.

56:24.120 --> 56:29.700
Some of the distributions have it in the archives, but I've been working on helping introduce

56:29.700 --> 56:32.660
this package into the Debian and Ubuntu archives.

56:32.660 --> 56:39.460
And I've got a PPA for Ubuntu Disco and Eon, that's 1904 and 1910 for people that want

56:39.460 --> 56:40.620
to have a play.

56:40.620 --> 56:48.140
But it is as excruciatingly detailed about your CPU, cache, motherboard, memory, system

56:48.140 --> 56:51.500
and graphic configuration as CPUZ is on Windows.

56:51.500 --> 56:52.940
It's still a bit of kit.

56:52.940 --> 56:57.540
I have used this before, but it is sometimes a bit of a pain in the butt to get it working

56:57.540 --> 56:59.580
on a more recent distro.

56:59.580 --> 57:03.980
So if you're working on the packaging side of this, I'm all in, that's great.

57:03.980 --> 57:08.620
I just installed it on Arch in the space of time it took me to Wimpy to tell us about

57:08.620 --> 57:09.620
it.

57:09.620 --> 57:10.620
And it works just fine, Chris.

57:10.620 --> 57:11.620
Get on with it.

57:11.620 --> 57:12.620
By the way, did you guys know that Alex is using Arch?

57:12.620 --> 57:13.620
You know, I might've heard that.

57:13.620 --> 57:19.020
Yeah, I think he may have told us.

57:19.020 --> 57:25.660
That's a great, that is one of those app picks that I have this category of tools that are

57:25.660 --> 57:28.380
my favorite tools that I have forgotten to mention enough.

57:28.380 --> 57:29.380
And that is one of them.

57:29.380 --> 57:31.700
They're just so reliable sitting there at the bottom.

57:31.700 --> 57:35.940
It's when I'm reviewing a laptop or a desktop and I'm not intimately familiar, it's such

57:35.940 --> 57:40.020
a great tool for me to just understand some of the most important bits about a machine

57:40.020 --> 57:41.280
and tell me where to start.

57:41.280 --> 57:46.900
When I was overclocking the CPU and motherboard on this thing, it's got a prime 95 generator

57:46.900 --> 57:47.900
built in.

57:47.900 --> 57:52.120
So you can use that to sort of test the stability of your overclock and make sure everything's

57:52.120 --> 57:53.120
performing well.

57:53.120 --> 57:57.020
So it's a real useful bit of kit.

57:57.020 --> 58:03.420
I've found a few interesting bits of software, which you could describe as software for risers

58:03.420 --> 58:09.860
that I'm working on bringing to Debian and Ubuntu over the coming weeks and months.

58:09.860 --> 58:10.860
I support this.

58:10.860 --> 58:11.940
I will buy you a beer.

58:11.940 --> 58:13.300
I support this.

58:13.300 --> 58:18.180
CPUX has a wonderful app image that works really well.

58:18.180 --> 58:21.020
I've been using that on all my different distros.

58:21.020 --> 58:22.020
You've got to be kidding me.

58:22.020 --> 58:23.020
Yes.

58:23.020 --> 58:24.020
Thank you.

58:24.020 --> 58:25.020
Oh my God.

58:25.020 --> 58:26.020
I never even checked.

58:26.020 --> 58:31.020
Unfortunately, app image does not come, I think Snap and Flatpak, but I don't often

58:31.020 --> 58:32.020
think app image.

58:32.020 --> 58:33.020
All you do is download it, man.

58:33.020 --> 58:34.020
Yeah.

58:34.020 --> 58:35.020
I should check it.

58:35.020 --> 58:36.020
All right.

58:36.020 --> 58:37.020
Good to know.

58:37.020 --> 58:38.020
Good to know.

58:38.020 --> 58:39.460
Well, it's getting easier and easier for us to run software these days.

58:39.460 --> 58:44.940
That's truly, it has been one of my favorite things about, it's been in the works for years,

58:44.940 --> 58:50.660
but I feel like I really appreciate and realize that in 2019, it is easier than ever for me

58:50.660 --> 58:55.460
to pick whatever distro, whatever desktop and still get all the software I want.

58:55.460 --> 58:58.520
But app image and Snaps and Flatpaks are a big part of that.

58:58.520 --> 59:02.520
So it's pretty awesome to be a Linux user these days.

59:02.520 --> 59:06.860
If you want to get more Martin Wimpress, go check out Ubuntu Podcast.

59:06.860 --> 59:12.260
A brand new fresh version just came out just a few days ago, and it's worth a good listen

59:12.260 --> 59:17.260
where Wimpy had a good take on a few things like we talked about earlier in the show.

59:17.260 --> 59:21.700
So extended coverage on some of these topics in that episode of Ubuntu Podcast.

59:21.700 --> 59:22.700
Thanks for making it, Wimpy.

59:22.700 --> 59:24.340
It was good to see you and hear you.

59:24.340 --> 59:25.340
Thank you for having me.

59:25.340 --> 59:26.340
It's been delightful.

59:26.340 --> 59:30.420
Now, obviously, Mumble Room, we appreciate all of you for being here.

59:30.420 --> 59:34.460
You all are very great, and our Mumble Room is open to anyone in the community.

59:34.460 --> 59:40.220
We will have a brief mic check to make sure that you've got a microphone, and we also

59:40.220 --> 59:41.460
would like you to have headphones.

59:41.460 --> 59:43.500
But don't worry, we're friendly about it.

59:43.500 --> 59:47.780
And push to talk, so that way it's amenable for on-air production.

59:47.780 --> 59:51.220
That's really all it takes, and then you can jump in the conversation about the topics

59:51.220 --> 59:54.100
that we cover and sometimes influence the cover of the show.

59:54.100 --> 59:55.260
Help us make the show better.

59:55.260 --> 59:56.540
Yeah, we really do appreciate it.

59:56.540 --> 59:58.980
So you can get information about that in our IRC room.

59:58.980 --> 01:00:05.860
Go to irc.geekshed.net, pound Jupiter Broadcasting, hashtag, hashtag, I should say, not pound,

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:06.860
hashtag, hashtag.

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:07.860
Octothorp.

01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:08.860
Thank you.

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:09.860
Thank you.

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:10.860
You knew what I wanted.

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:11.860
I got you.

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:12.860
Thank you.

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.940
I do like the Octothorp.

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:20.180
You can also just Google Jupiter Colony Mumble, as well as participate in our chat room during

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.180
the show.

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:23.260
We do it all on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv.

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:28.780
Tuesdays at 2 p.m. Pacific, although the stream usually gets started about a half hour, 45

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:29.780
minutes.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:30.780
It's making early.

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:31.780
There's a lot more show.

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:33.540
Then there's some post-show.

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:35.540
Some of it makes it into the edit.

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:36.540
Most of it don't.

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:42.900
jblive.tv for that, JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar for your time zone, and LinuxUnplugged.com

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:47.780
slash, get ready for this, three, two, one, for all of our links.

01:00:47.780 --> 01:01:03.100
See you next Tuesday.

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:30.300
Well, we had that whole alliteration theme this episode for at least 70% of the show.

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.140
I feel like our title should have some of that in it.

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.140
It definitely should.

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:34.140
You know?

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:39.860
Well, before the show, we were debating doing some Raspberry Pi 4 coverage, which there's

01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:42.580
going to be plenty of coming up on the network in the next week or so.

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:48.380
So we thought, you know, maybe not, but we've been trying various different distributions

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:52.980
and Wimpy, I don't know if you've seen this, but there is some bloke out there has an unofficial

01:01:52.980 --> 01:02:00.340
current build of Ubuntu 18.04 LTS for the Raspberry Pi with a bunch of the Raspbian

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:06.540
kernel patches and drivers and whatnot applied to his, whatever you want to call it, image

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:07.740
of 18.04.

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:09.640
I am aware.

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:14.260
And there's a group of people for CentOS that are essentially doing the same thing.

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:18.260
The CentOS community came along and said, all right, well, let's see what you did here.

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:21.940
And they've rolled some of that into CentOS 7.7.

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:26.100
But the results are so far a little hit and miss, eh Cheesy?

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:30.500
Yeah, so I've put 7.7 on a Pi 3.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.480
It's 32-bit only.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.480
It does work.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:43.420
I have had some segment faults and I had it just basically die on me whenever I was trying

01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:46.580
to install today's app pick.

01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:49.480
So I think there's still some work to be done there.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:54.540
There currently isn't a 64-bit image, at least not on the site for CentOS.

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:59.820
So I'll try it again later on whenever I feel like it's maybe matured a little bit more.

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:01.460
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:02.860
It's going to take some time.

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:13.140
I didn't quite fully appreciate how married the Raspberry Pi 4 would be to Raspbian initially.

01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:17.340
But if you want to do firmware updates on the Raspberry Pi, you need Raspbian.

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:23.380
If you want full video decoding and all full driver support, you need Raspbian.

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:28.340
My Pi 4, which sat on my desk all week, I've actually been playing with it all show.

01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:33.300
It's booting now off a USB SSD, I mean, slash boot's still on the SD card, but everything

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:35.700
else is on the USB SSD.

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:39.460
And it's slower to boot from the SSD by six seconds.

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:40.460
Would you believe that?

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:41.460
What?

01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:46.060
Wes and I were just this morning talking about setting up essentially Raspbian on the SSD

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:51.980
with grub configured to boot another distro, I mean, not an SSD, but with grub on the SD

01:03:51.980 --> 01:04:00.340
or the micro SD card pointing to an OS on a USB 3 SSD, like CentOS or Ubuntu or something

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:01.340
else.

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:02.340
Exactly what I'm doing here.

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:07.140
And I'm getting on DD, I'm just trying to do some basic benchmarking.

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:11.580
I was getting about 10 to 15 megs a second to the SD card.

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:17.660
I am seeing 144 to the SSD, which so there is some improvement, but installing packages

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:20.220
wasn't as lightning as I hoped.

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:23.380
What SD card do you have on that thing?

01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:28.140
It's the one that came with my Mavic Pro, so it's like a SanDisk Gold 16 gig thing or

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.140
something.

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:30.140
You'd think it'd be somewhat decent.

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:36.700
I just put a Samsung Super Speed one in there and I'm getting around 80 megabytes to the

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:37.700
SD card.

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:38.700
It's still slower.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:40.100
You see that's up there with a mechanical hard drive.

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:41.100
Yeah, exactly.

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:45.260
Which I also tested and you get about 80 or 90 meg on a mechanical drive.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:47.060
It's not quite fast enough, though.

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:48.900
It's not quite.

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:51.060
And Raspbian is fine.

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.060
It's actually-

01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:54.180
I like watching you say this.

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:57.660
You struggle, but it's weird to have that limitation.

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.220
I mean, not even a strict limitation, right?

01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:05.060
But it's so much more of a platform and we're used to the generic x86 world.

01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:06.060
Yes.

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:07.060
You're buying a platform.

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:09.720
You're buying a product on a platform and that's fine.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:10.720
It's good.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:11.720
Raspbian is fine.

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:12.720
It's all good.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:18.400
It's just not the OS I have in production anywhere else in the world and never would

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.640
for any reason.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:24.260
So it's like would be great if I could also run-

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:26.060
You're saying we're switching the studio to Raspbian?

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:27.060
No.

01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:28.060
Never going to happen, right?

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:29.180
It's never going to happen.

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:34.720
So now I always have to have some one-off boxes and I guess it's okay.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.720
It's fine.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.060
You know, it's fine.

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:38.940
Your lament is duly noted.

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:39.940
Yes.

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:41.240
Thank you.

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:43.580
Thank you.

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:46.100
Maybe I'm just complaining because you know what?

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:51.100
Thankfully they do make a Raspbian Lite version available, which makes it a perfect little

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:55.840
headless system that gets great updates and runs containers just as well as any other

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.060
distro runs containers.

01:05:57.060 --> 01:06:01.220
So at the end of the day, I can't really complain that much because it's working for me.

01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:07.180
But I don't know, I guess I had this idea in my head that I was buying a 64-bit sort

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:09.360
of general ARM computer.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:13.460
Not that it's not a product, but that it's so well known that I could just slam almost

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:16.100
anything on it and that hasn't been the case.

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:17.260
It is the case with like the Pi 3.

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:22.260
I can pretty much put any distro on there I want and be happy, but I didn't anticipate

01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:24.060
this lag with the Pi 4.

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:25.060
Yeah.

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:29.100
Well, it's a similar amount of lag we saw when the Pi was first introduced.

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:34.180
You know, it took some time for the other distributions to ramp up and you know, get

01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:35.180
their game on.

01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:37.020
So, you know, it's a new beast.

01:06:37.020 --> 01:06:39.380
It's not an evolution of what's come before.

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.900
It's an entirely different bit of kit.

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:47.900
So and as you've pointed out, there is a whole load of bring up that needs to be done in

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.100
a very different way.

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.100
Yeah.

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:51.460
That's what's hard to appreciate from afar.

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:52.640
And now I understand that.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:56.340
And that said, I just got another two Raspberry Pis, which I have projects already planned

01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:57.340
for and I'm ready to go.

01:06:57.340 --> 01:06:58.340
I'm good with it.

01:06:58.340 --> 01:06:59.820
I understand that now.

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:02.900
I just think that if I hadn't bought it yet, I would have appreciated to have a better

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:07.620
understanding of that, which isn't made very clear really anywhere in any reviews.

01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:08.620
There's kind of a split, right?

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:12.580
Like a lot of this stuff is focused on people just getting into computers or Linux, not

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:15.100
power users who hosted Linux podcasts.

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:19.380
They'll want to set up like eight different servers, services on their homeland on a Raspberry

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:24.660
Pi 4, which I would, you know, really before the Raspberry Pi 4, I would have kind of just

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:26.220
considered these to be toys.

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:31.180
And now things kind of just shifted when I got four gigs of RAM and I got four CPU cores

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:35.100
and I got dedicated gigabit ethernet and Wi-Fi on its own bus.

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:39.260
It's like you were excited about it as a maybe potential desktop, but really it's become

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:40.260
your new server platform.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:41.260
Yeah, it's not.

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:42.260
It's not a great desktop platform yet.

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:45.420
It's definitely usable and serviceable, but it's not there for me.

01:07:45.420 --> 01:08:06.020
And as a server, it's there.
