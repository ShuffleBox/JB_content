00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
It's so much better for remote desktops than even something like Budgie, because obviously it's a lot lighter and you haven't got to worry about heavy compositing, heavy shadows and all these gradients and stuff.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
And for remote desktop in and to my NUC or server, whichever is running it, it's fantastic.

00:16.000 --> 00:30.000
You know, XFCE stands out for me as there was this workstation when I was at a school district that ran Debian and XFCE and then I came back nearly 10 years later and it was still running Debian and XFCE and it was just like the same rock solid.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
They went to that machine, they opened up a terminal, they SSH into the servers and that's all it did.

00:36.000 --> 00:46.000
So yeah, I know a lot of people that still use XFCE. I think it kind of gets less attention than it probably deserves, but mostly because of its very nature, I think.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Are you not ever tempted to replace it?

00:50.000 --> 00:59.000
Well, I mean, going forward, I think the thing that's going to play against XFCE is the lack of high DPI for a lot of people.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
That's starting to become a bit of a problem.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
Although maybe that might be the XFCE crowd might be sort of the later adopters of that, right?

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
True. I mean, GTK itself, you know, you need GTK free for that stuff.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
So once they start to go that road, then, you know, they kind of solve those problems and they're partially there.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
As far as remote desktop goes, do you think Mate or Mate would also fit the bill?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
I mean, it could. I mean...

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
It's got this brisk menu you might check out.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah, if it's got brisk menu.

01:30.000 --> 01:47.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 183 for February 7th, 2017.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that at least half of us can barely breathe.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
My name is Chris.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
My name is Wes.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
And I don't think it's you. I think you sound good.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
It's good.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
Thank you.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Hello, Wes.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
You know what, Wes? We've got a great show today.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
So we have some open source projects to get into that I'm very excited to cover.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
One of my favorite projects got a huge update this week.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Actually, I shouldn't say one.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
One, two, three that I can see just on this list right here.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
I'm super excited to talk about.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
So we'll be digging into that.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Then Google's got something that's going to blow your mind.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
It's really something.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
We've got a big warning for those of you that are using the Ubuntu on Windows environment.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
We've covered that in the past if you've been trying that out.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
Huge disclaimer coming up in the show for you.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
You need to know about it because data is getting lost.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
2011 to find out.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Dun, dun, dun.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
And then towards the end of the show, not even the end, but as we get into the final chapters.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
To prepare ourselves for the end.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Yeah.

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
We will be talking about something that I suspect has been on the minds of a lot of our listeners.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Not all of them.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Those lovely listeners.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
Just the ones that are a little cranky.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.000
Now we're going to talk about some things that have been sent into the show as feedback.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
And I think are a great opportunity to address them.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
And talk about the bigger picture.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
What's going on here.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Plus, Wes, on top of all that stuff, you know what else we got?

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
We got that tried and true great virtual lug who's here to join us for yet another episode.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
Hello.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Hello.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Hello.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
So let's start with one of the projects I'm thrilled to announce as an update today.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Yes, we have breaking news here on the show.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
This is CNN breaking news.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
Kodi 17 is out.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
The Krypton release is here, which brings its new user interface, better organization settings,

03:39.000 --> 03:44.000
and lots and lots and lots of under the hood changes on the video player, music library,

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
PVR, audio support, and massive Android things.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
And tons and tons and tons and tons of small bug fixes and improvements to stability.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
So let's start with the new look.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
It's got the new skin.

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
And it's been designed for the 10-foot interface, while touchscreens have their new touchscreens.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
I like that.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Yes.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
And there's some samples here.

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
I was just kind of surprise updated on my NVIDIA Shield TV.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Oh, really?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
Yeah, just one day.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I opened it up.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
I'm like, holy crap, I got 17.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Like I was waiting and waiting and waiting.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Then one day, boom, there it is.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Check out this, Wes.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
The video engine is undergoing a multi-phase rewrite, and Kodi 17 delivers the next wave

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
of changes with improvements to stability, audio and video synchronization, refresh rate

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
switching, decoding and encoding to video, which obviously is pretty important.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
They've also got hardware accelerated playback of DVDs, OpenGL dithering, new and improved

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
support for lots of streaming protocols and upgrades and updates to things like RTMP support

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
and MPEG dash, which would be-

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Nice.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
That's useful for us.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Exactly.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
And I really like seeing this.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
Kodi on Linux can now use some simple color profile stuff to color correct displays on

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Linux.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
No way.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
That's really pushing into the premium stuff.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
It is, really.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Yeah.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
You know, when you get a really nice television or whatever your display is.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Yeah, right.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
If you have it, you might as well use that.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Yeah, yeah.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
Also, the PVR stuff has gotten a lot of new functionality, which includes live TV support.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
But like I said, the one that I'm really excited about is with Kodi 17, there's one downside

05:08.000 --> 05:13.000
if you're an Android user is there's now a minimum requirement of Android 5.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
I think I can handle that.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Yeah.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Yeah.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
However, that with it brings the official audio API for Android, which is probably a

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
really good thing for multiple reasons, which means you also get DTS-HD and DTS-X and Dolby

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
TrueHD and Dolby Atmos pass through.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Boy, when you combine that with the color correction stuff and whatnot, I mean, this

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
is getting to be a seriously premium home theater product.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.000
Can I admit something?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.000
Yeah.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
I have yet to try Kodi on Android.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Oh, it's good.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
I know.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Isn't that ridiculous?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Oh, it's good.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
You know, I wish the Shield, I wish Nvidia could bring the Shield TV down in price because

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I really think it's a pretty great box.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
I think it's almost $200.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
They just updated it.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
But you could probably pick up a used one off of eBay because they first gen.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.000
And you know, I found one that was a lot cheaper that's pretty great, too.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
So there's other good ones out there.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
The thing I would have to say about this, and I know I talk about it too much, but the

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
thing I would have to say about the Shield TV is now I'm like six months into it, almost

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
more than that, I think.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
And solid, consistent, really great updates.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Like every update that lands, I'm like, oh, awesome.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Let me download that.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
And mind you, I'm on a MiFi connection.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
And I got two of these things now.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
So I'm downloading two gigs of updates because each are a gig.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
You need that Steam caching thing we were talking about.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Yeah, really.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
But you know, like recently, one of the updates not only brought the latest monthly Android

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
security updates, which I'm a big fan of, but also turned on Prime Video.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
So now you get Hulu, Netflix, you get YouTube, of course.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
That's nice, yeah.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
You get Prime Video, Sling TV.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
It's really if you're a cord cutter.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Does it do DLNA?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Oh, yeah.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Oh, of course.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Nice.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
Well, then you've also got full-fledged Kodi.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
It's also it.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
The Shield TV itself can be a Plex server.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
And it can also support external storage.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Okay.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Wow.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
Or, of course, can be a first class Plex client.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Right.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
So it's such a good little powerful TV box.

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
You combine it with Kodi and it is the most rock solid home theater setup I've ever had.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
And I've been like refining this for so many years.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
You know, people have listened to the Linux action shows since the very early days.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.000
Remember when I was talking to a gentleman who was building a PC where the only thing

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
this PC was going to do was this entire multimedia center is going to be home automation and

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
multimedia PVR DVR and you put it in there.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
Everything from this monstrosity to different iterations of myth TV to different iterations

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
of different front end players with back end Linux servers.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
What I've really found now is big centralized storage and beer Plex front ends and then

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Android TV for the front end player.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.000
And it's such a slick, smooth setup.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
Everything is supported.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
Anything you'd want to play.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
And it's so trouble free.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
If you if you want something where you just sit down, you wake the device up and you start

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
watching your TV and you don't have to sit there and fiddle with things every now and

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
then.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.000
This is so that does it trouble you that like maybe your storage is free BSD and then your

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
client is an Android thing.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
Well, my storage is Linux for this setup.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
You're right here at the studio.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
It's free.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
It's free now.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Yeah.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
And the front end being Android.

08:13.000 --> 08:20.000
You know, the thing is, is once Linux has has gotten like if they can get like Ubuntu

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
core something where they have transactional updates where I get monthly images that come

08:24.000 --> 08:28.000
down, it flashes my system, it reboots and I'm running the new version has that recovery

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
kind of rollback.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Then I think then if you're willing to say, all right, well, I'll forfeit Netflix and

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
Hulu and prime TV and sling TV for a little while.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
So that way I can use Kodi on Linux.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
If that's really what your goal is, that I think is achievable, either through like through

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
using a sophisticated snapshots or waiting for something like Ubuntu core to come around

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
with Kodi built on top of it, which could be a killer distribution through because then

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
you get transactional updates or even Fedora with, you know, with the project atomic something

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
that gives you transactional updates because you want when you're sitting down to watch

09:00.000 --> 09:01.000
TV, you generally want to relax.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Yeah, it's an appliance.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
And even if you know how to fix it, like you don't want to roll hell in the SSH and to

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
my TV, I will.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
And you're just like, oh, everyone watch this cool video I found.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
I want to show it to you.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
So just give me like 10 minutes.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
It'll be fine.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.000
Having tried to pull this off in different iterations now for a decade, I have so many

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
times been gone to show somebody something and it fails and I'm like, oh, let me fix

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
my TV set up first and then I can play this video.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
And granted, maybe it's only five times over 10 years.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
But each time it bites you.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
You never let it go.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
And you've completely lost that person as a convert.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Like they're not they're totally not sold on your set up when you go to play video and

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
it fails.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
So I've that's where I've kind of slid to using Android for my television.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
I love it.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
But you get the apps, you get the reliability.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
And if you get a good OEM, you get updates, you get good updates.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
That's what I think it takes to use to for me to trust to use Android.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
So Cody 17 Krypton release is out.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I don't see producer Michael in the Mumble Room.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
Otherwise, I'd ask him if he had any other.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
You have any thoughts on the new Krypton release from an add on perspective or just from a

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
general release perspective?

10:06.000 --> 10:11.000
Not as far as like anything from the beta differences like the it's more polished and it runs a

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
lot more streamlined than I expect.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
What about from like 16?

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Like if that because I didn't really use the beta as much myself.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.000
I just sort of waited.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Well, as far as like the interface is amazing.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
Like it's such a huge improvement.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Yes.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Like this.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.000
It goes from a thing that looked like 10 years ago to something that's modern and stuff like

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
that.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
Yeah.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
And everything's really quick.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Like you get access to stuff a lot faster with this new layout.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
Once it's up to you can totally grok what everything does.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
The navigation is easier.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
It's like where the old interface with confluence there was like to do one thing there was like

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
four or five different ways and you have to like configure it in different ways to make

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
it do it in the like the order you want it to do.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
And now it's just so much better.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
Like as far as like the differences between the betas and stuff and the current release

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
is actually not that much.

10:58.000 --> 11:04.000
But the differences between 16 and 17 is just like massively drastic.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Like it's fantastic.

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
And surprisingly, the new Krypton interface is actually like really fast.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
I kind of expected to be an underperformer, but it's not.

11:14.000 --> 11:20.000
Now, am I going to have all of my awesome add ons break?

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
No, you might have some add on break depending on if they're paying attention or not.

11:24.000 --> 11:31.000
Like there are certain features that the APIs changed throughout the 16, 17 switch.

11:31.000 --> 11:37.000
But there was plenty of time and there was a before the betas even came out there was

11:37.000 --> 11:43.000
a lot of API talk for developers to have a lot of headway so that they have at least

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
a year before their release was even out.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
So they had plenty of time to actually make the transition.

11:48.000 --> 11:55.000
So one of the things that's really nice about Kodi is this add on system allows for anybody

11:55.000 --> 11:59.000
even who's somebody who might be a quasi competitor to come along and develop an add on.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
We covered this before, but obviously there's an MB add on that uses your MB database.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
Oh yeah, there is.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
So all your metadata and your watch status are synced across your Kodi machines.

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
But the Crazy Cats at Plex also released a Plex add on for Kodi and I've had time to

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
play with it.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
Oh, have you?

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Oh, good.

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
So it's like a full on new, you go into almost a new UI mode for Kodi.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
It's a full on application.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Oh, interesting.

12:26.000 --> 12:32.000
And then you still are using Kodi for the playback because you can still hear Kodi sounds

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
like the whoosh, whoosh, like little noises Kodi makes.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
That's the test of a true Kodi user.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
Yeah, sweet, sweet.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
You hear that still when it's playing and it fast forwards and rewinds better than Plex

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
ever does.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
Sure.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
But it's supporting like Plex's automatic play the next episode features.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
It's marking them red on the Plex database as you watch them through Kodi.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
It's nice.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
The kids were using it over the weekend and the thing that really pushed it over the edge

12:59.000 --> 13:06.000
is now you can bark at the Echo and you can say Echo open Plex, Echo play Steven Universe

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
season one episode 40.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
Wow.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
And it plays it on the predefined player that you've chosen already.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
That's pretty slick.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.000
It can be the Plex player if you have Plex add-on open in Kodi and you set it up on the

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Echo, you can actually have the Echo remotely trigger videos.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Through the Plex API.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.000
Yeah.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
Wow.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Okay, that's pretty cool.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.000
It's crazy.

13:26.000 --> 13:29.000
Does that add-on support direct play like where the Kodi does all the decoding?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Yes.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Nice.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Yeah, yeah.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
In fact, I believe, I don't know for sure because pretty much all my stuff is standardized

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
now on x264.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
But I think it will play it back anything directly that Kodi supports.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
That's great.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Yeah.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Yeah.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
And I have not had a chance to try it yet.

13:45.000 --> 13:52.000
Mr. Michael, is there anything else you wanted to add on the Kodi stuff before we move on?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Not really.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
Well, there is actually an interesting article out there talking about the reputation of

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Kodi having...

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Right.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Other than that, that's kind of like...

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Kodi is not a piracy app.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
Yeah, exactly.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
That was the article.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
Yeah, exactly.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Yeah.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
But it's funny because there's like the Kodi Twitter account is kind of funny to watch.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Someone might want to be interested in that.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Like...

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
That's a good suggestion.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
Yeah.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.720
There's people who will send messages to Kodi that are obviously pirating thing and Kodi

14:20.720 --> 14:23.600
will respond with a joke back to them saying, yeah, we don't care.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.600
Yeah.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.500
They're basically probably trying to shame people for doing piracy and they're really

14:27.500 --> 14:31.000
trying to position themselves as we're not a piracy application.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Exactly.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.000
Probably a good thing.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Especially the legal trouble.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
They've been sort of – well, not they, but people that are selling Kodi boxes are

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
failing.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.360
And like it would be a shame for that to be its reputation when it's just getting so

14:40.360 --> 14:41.360
good.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.360
Right.

14:42.360 --> 14:47.440
And meanwhile, companies like Vizio are legitimately screwing their customers and this is why all

14:47.440 --> 14:51.260
of our hardware, even our televisions really should be open.

14:51.260 --> 14:55.520
They're going to have to pay $2.2 million for what they did but according to a complaint

14:55.520 --> 15:01.400
filed Monday by the FTC here in the US, the internet connected TVs from Vizio contained

15:01.400 --> 15:05.680
ACR which was short for automated content recognition software.

15:05.680 --> 15:10.440
Without asking for permission, the ACR code captured second by second information about

15:10.440 --> 15:12.100
the video the TV displayed.

15:12.100 --> 15:15.720
The software collected other personal information and then transmitted along with the viewing

15:15.720 --> 15:18.400
data to servers controlled by Vizio.

15:18.400 --> 15:23.320
Vizio then sold it to unnamed third parties for purposes of audience measurement, analysis

15:23.320 --> 15:24.320
and tracking.

15:24.320 --> 15:27.640
Of course, you could see Vizio doing this like we've got this great data on Vizio users

15:27.640 --> 15:32.520
and Vizio televisions are featured in Costco with millions of sales and we'll sell this

15:32.520 --> 15:33.520
to you.

15:33.520 --> 15:34.640
And you know, TiVo tried to do this.

15:34.640 --> 15:35.640
They all tried to do this.

15:35.640 --> 15:36.640
Oh yeah.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.240
And you can totally see why advertisers and marketers want that information.

15:39.240 --> 15:42.960
And I doubt Vizio, very much doubt Vizio is the only smart TV manufacturer doing this.

15:42.960 --> 15:43.960
Certainly not, right?

15:43.960 --> 15:44.960
They just got caught.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.080
So check this out.

15:46.080 --> 15:49.920
For all of these uses, defendants provided highly specific second by second information

15:49.920 --> 15:50.920
about the television viewing.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.020
This is according to FTC lawyers in Monday's complaint.

15:53.020 --> 15:57.480
Each line of the report provides viewing information about a single television.

15:57.480 --> 16:02.120
In a securities filing, Vizio states that its data analytics program, for example, will

16:02.120 --> 16:07.000
provide highly specific viewing behavior data on a massive scale with great accuracy.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Oh.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Yes.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.600
Which can be used to generate intelligent insights for advertisers.

16:13.600 --> 16:19.360
So this is why I don't want podcasts to ever go to like, I don't, if you listen to the

16:19.360 --> 16:23.440
show in, what's that, oh, what's it called?

16:23.440 --> 16:24.440
Oh, I forget.

16:24.440 --> 16:27.880
It's, it's like this, it's like streams all of the podcasts together.

16:27.880 --> 16:31.040
It's a, it's a, it's a Stitcher, Stitcher, Stitcher, Stitcher.

16:31.040 --> 16:37.200
If you listen in Stitcher, or if you listen to podcasts using the Google Play Store podcast

16:37.200 --> 16:40.880
directory, please consider getting your podcasts from somewhere else.

16:40.880 --> 16:44.520
Because what these companies are doing are trying to do this kind of data analytics to

16:44.520 --> 16:45.520
podcasting.

16:45.520 --> 16:46.920
So right now, we're going to get into an ad.

16:46.920 --> 16:49.240
And I'm going to say go to linux.ting.com.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.800
That's the only tracking that happens.

16:51.800 --> 16:56.280
If you go to linux.ting.com and you get a device or you get, you sign up, that's where

16:56.280 --> 16:57.280
the tracking starts and ends.

16:57.280 --> 16:58.280
You know we sent you.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.280
Right.

16:59.280 --> 17:02.480
But what, what Stitcher does and Google Play does is they're trying to do to podcasts what

17:02.480 --> 17:05.920
Vizio is doing to television, where they're trying to figure out where you turned your

17:05.920 --> 17:10.480
volume up or down, when you pause, when you rewind, when you fast forward, they want all

17:10.480 --> 17:11.480
of that.

17:11.480 --> 17:15.640
And they get that Google Play and Stitcher collect that constantly while you're using

17:15.640 --> 17:18.920
their apps and send those metrics off to the advertisers.

17:18.920 --> 17:23.720
So this is a dirty thing that it's where podcasts are really on the line of this happening to.

17:23.720 --> 17:28.600
And if some of these services start to get more and more popular, I feel like this could

17:28.600 --> 17:29.920
be a, this could be a bad case.

17:29.920 --> 17:34.200
So Vizio also, by the way, not denying this.

17:34.200 --> 17:37.600
They wrote in an official note, they say the ACR program was never paired with viewing

17:37.600 --> 17:43.220
data, was never paired viewing data with personal identified information such as contact information.

17:43.220 --> 17:47.780
But they do admit they were collecting this information to aggregate a summary of reports.

17:47.780 --> 17:49.880
But here's the problem.

17:49.880 --> 17:55.160
If you look at the data, well, it turns out the software periodically appended IP addresses

17:55.160 --> 17:59.100
and also appended other data to make it possible to collect other information about the viewer

17:59.100 --> 18:02.880
like your age, your sex, your income, your marital status, household size, education

18:02.880 --> 18:07.280
level, home ownership status and home value, which all could be associated and provided

18:07.280 --> 18:08.400
to the advertiser.

18:08.400 --> 18:12.400
The collection occurred under a setting that was described as a smart interactivity feature

18:12.400 --> 18:15.380
that enables program offers and suggestions.

18:15.380 --> 18:18.960
The menu never informs users that the feature also transmitted viewing habits and other

18:18.960 --> 18:19.960
personal information.

18:19.960 --> 18:24.280
Now I kind of want to see like a Wireshark log as one of these TVs.

18:24.280 --> 18:27.380
I've wondered because we have a Vizio here in the studio and one day we were just sitting

18:27.380 --> 18:31.040
out there in the living room and a Wi-Fi access point on that Vizio came online for a little

18:31.040 --> 18:32.600
bit and then shut down.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.920
We didn't, we hadn't changed it, we didn't, nothing, just, yeah.

18:35.920 --> 18:40.200
So anyways, under the terms of the settlement, Vizio is going to pay 1.5 million to the FTC

18:40.200 --> 18:43.760
and 700,000 to New Jersey's Division of Consumer Affairs.

18:43.760 --> 18:49.240
The settlement also requires Vizio to delete all of the collected data before March 1,

18:49.240 --> 18:50.240
2016.

18:50.240 --> 18:54.160
There was an aspect to the story though that really made me feel like, God, I do not like

18:54.160 --> 19:01.000
this part of it and I really wish like Ubuntu TV had been more successful or something.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.560
Or Firefox, that was a thing.

19:03.560 --> 19:07.400
You know, looking back at it retrospectively too, it feels like, it feels like if Canonical

19:07.400 --> 19:12.560
had really pushed on Ubuntu TV maybe over the phone or tablet, because you know, by

19:12.560 --> 19:15.960
the way, you know the BQ tablet, the Ubuntu tablet, it's over a year old now, it's gone

19:15.960 --> 19:19.860
nowhere, it's gone nowhere.

19:19.860 --> 19:24.320
So if they could have solved this television program problem, this host OS you need for

19:24.320 --> 19:26.920
the TV, there's still a hole for this.

19:26.920 --> 19:33.200
But here's the part I really didn't like and this is why I really wish we could have gotten

19:33.200 --> 19:35.080
like Ubuntu TV or something.

19:35.080 --> 19:40.120
So for those of us who bought old televisions, like we bought our TVs a while ago, like this

19:40.120 --> 19:46.440
one here in the studio, they retroactively sent software updates over the internet to

19:46.440 --> 19:50.320
these smart televisions to add this feature and to turn it on.

19:50.320 --> 19:53.600
So you could have a two-year-old television, they're like, oh well, I checked off all the

19:53.600 --> 19:55.520
bad privacy things when I set it up.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.520
Yeah, yeah.

19:56.520 --> 20:02.000
And then boom, a software update comes along, turns it on and starts sending.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
That's like not even the chance for consent.

20:04.000 --> 20:10.080
No, and I just think that's so creepy and of course they're the only ones caught, right?

20:10.080 --> 20:13.240
So, yeah.

20:13.240 --> 20:15.880
Let's get some open source on all the things.

20:15.880 --> 20:20.720
Speaking of Ubuntu phone though, there is an update running out to Ubuntu phone users,

20:20.720 --> 20:25.280
OTA 15, to phones and tablets, primarily a bug fix update.

20:25.280 --> 20:30.600
It's also going to address an issue with loading HTTPS sites on the stock Ubuntu web browser.

20:30.600 --> 20:34.600
I do like me my HTTPS.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.760
Don't worry if you're not seeing your update yet.

20:35.760 --> 20:39.000
This is the start of a phased upgrade procedure that they're going to follow which should

20:39.000 --> 20:41.860
take really less than a day or two for everybody to see the update.

20:41.860 --> 20:46.880
So the other thing I thought was really great about this article that Joey wrote for OMG

20:46.880 --> 20:51.060
Ubuntu is he breaks down the difference between Ubuntu touch and Ubuntu personal because this

20:51.060 --> 20:56.800
is how Canonical screws it up every time, is they sort of evolve the language or they

20:56.800 --> 21:01.700
weren't initially clear about it or it's changed as what they're doing has changed and the

21:01.700 --> 21:04.960
internet doesn't catch up.

21:04.960 --> 21:09.320
Where I think Canonical kind of trips up on this is messaging the changes.

21:09.320 --> 21:14.200
A lot of times it just gets appended to a completely non-story.

21:14.200 --> 21:21.160
So in the story about an update for Ubuntu phone that nobody cares about, I mean in consideration

21:21.160 --> 21:24.400
of the entire audience size, obviously there's people that listen to this show that care

21:24.400 --> 21:25.400
a lot about it.

21:25.400 --> 21:33.480
But looking at the entire mobile industry, that's not even just Ubuntu users, it's not

21:33.480 --> 21:34.480
a big story.

21:34.480 --> 21:39.680
And in this big story is a great explanation of how all of the vernacular works.

21:39.680 --> 21:45.040
So Ubuntu touch is technically just Ubuntu, wherever it runs it's just Ubuntu.

21:45.040 --> 21:49.560
And so Canonical says they're trying to evolve their terminology to provide better distinction

21:49.560 --> 21:52.560
between various eras of Ubuntu mobile devices.

21:52.560 --> 21:56.720
Ubuntu touch is the popular term given to the mobile oriented version of Ubuntu based

21:56.720 --> 22:02.160
on Ubuntu 1504 that uses click packages and ships pre-installed on all of the commercial

22:02.160 --> 22:03.800
Ubuntu smartphones.

22:03.800 --> 22:09.080
Ubuntu personal is the official name given to the snapified version of Ubuntu that will

22:09.080 --> 22:14.760
form the successor to Ubuntu touch, which is currently based on Ubuntu 1604 and uses

22:14.760 --> 22:16.120
the snap package format.

22:16.120 --> 22:22.520
So Ubuntu personal uses the snap package format based on 1604, Ubuntu touch is 1504 that uses

22:22.520 --> 22:23.520
click packages.

22:23.520 --> 22:24.520
Clear?

22:24.520 --> 22:30.960
Is there a diagram I can see, that's what I would like, I can just print it out, I can

22:30.960 --> 22:33.160
bring it for the show so I don't say the wrong thing.

22:33.160 --> 22:34.160
I know, right?

22:34.160 --> 22:38.880
Hey, while we're talking about mobile, why don't I mention Ting, linux.ting.com.

22:38.880 --> 22:43.160
Go there, sign up and when you go to our website, or our URL I should say, linux.ting.com, they'll

22:43.160 --> 22:48.120
take $25 off a device or if you bring one and they have CDMA and GSM compatibility,

22:48.120 --> 22:50.560
they'll give you $25 in service credit.

22:50.560 --> 22:55.000
No contract, no other termination fee and you only pay for what you use.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.640
It's $6 for the line and then it's just your usage.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.480
When you need help, you talk to a real human being.

23:01.480 --> 23:06.520
No hold, no phone trees, no transfers, it's the kind of level of service that you would

23:06.520 --> 23:10.040
think only like the hugest telco company could afford and of course once you get to that

23:10.040 --> 23:11.040
scale, what do you do?

23:11.040 --> 23:12.040
You outsource it.

23:12.040 --> 23:15.760
Ting is a totally different type of mobile network and this is why they're able to do

23:15.760 --> 23:17.200
things a little differently.

23:17.200 --> 23:21.120
So instead of having to invest in every single cell tower they build and fight with the local

23:21.120 --> 23:25.640
legislation and get all the licensing and figure out all of the clearances that they

23:25.640 --> 23:29.840
need, Ting works on top of other existing established mobile carriers to bring you sort

23:29.840 --> 23:35.080
of a hybrid mobile service so you get to pick between CDMA or GSM and they're able to focus

23:35.080 --> 23:39.920
on things like great customer service, fantastic tools to manage your account and of course

23:39.920 --> 23:41.520
a great selection of devices.

23:41.520 --> 23:46.120
They also just recently announced they'd be bringing on Ring Plus customers.

23:46.120 --> 23:53.280
I guess there was a bit of a falling up between Ring Plus and their parent carrier and Ting

23:53.280 --> 23:58.440
is a great company, backed by two cows, really knows how to do this, been around for a while

23:58.440 --> 24:03.160
and so they're stepping up and they're going to offer service to Ring Plus customers.

24:03.160 --> 24:08.080
So if that's you, you're going to have until Friday, February 11th to decide if you want

24:08.080 --> 24:09.080
to stay with Ting or not.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.040
They're not going to make it hard to leave too, if you don't want to, they're just a

24:11.040 --> 24:12.040
great company.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.640
They've got a great blog you can follow even if you're not a Ting customer.

24:14.640 --> 24:17.640
When you're ready to get started, go to linux.ting.com.

24:17.640 --> 24:21.720
See how much you would save by using this what would you save button right here.

24:21.720 --> 24:26.280
See the unbelievable prices and then bring a device or grab a device from Google Play

24:26.280 --> 24:32.240
or Ting store directly or just a SIM card, if that's what you need, linux.ting.com.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.400
Thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.400
They're the best.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.280
I love this update.

24:37.280 --> 24:39.360
This is good, good stuff.

24:39.360 --> 24:45.360
Speaking of the best, I think Plasma 5.9 is the best update to the Plasma desktop ever,

24:45.360 --> 24:53.500
ever, ever, ever and the best Plasma desktop release just got better with Plasma 5.9.1.

24:53.500 --> 24:59.800
Just some fixes, some breeze fixes, some discover fixes, other little things like that.

24:59.800 --> 25:03.960
I don't have really a lot to say other than I'm just going to check in with my Plasma

25:03.960 --> 25:08.560
usage because typically in the past, what's happened is I've switched to Plasma, I use

25:08.560 --> 25:13.640
it, I use it, I use it, something breaks in production with the audio or with – you

25:13.640 --> 25:18.640
know, after an update, something breaks and I bail quietly.

25:18.640 --> 25:21.120
Now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to kind of check in from time to time, say

25:21.120 --> 25:24.920
yeah, I'm still using it, this is what I'm finding to be the best configuration so far.

25:24.920 --> 25:28.160
I've been really happy with Neon so far.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.160
Oh, that's awesome.

25:29.160 --> 25:34.120
But also had a lot of success with Plasmon Arch too.

25:34.120 --> 25:40.680
I still to this day, if you use it on my main workstation, it's just been super rock solid

25:40.680 --> 25:41.680
flawless.

25:41.680 --> 25:42.680
Oh, that's great.

25:42.680 --> 25:43.960
I don't know how – I think we're like week two or three in this.

25:43.960 --> 25:47.840
I think we've been having this update for like three weeks now and I'm still at that

25:47.840 --> 25:53.720
stage where I walk in, the door opens and I set my bag down and I sit my butt in the

25:53.720 --> 25:58.200
chair and my hands on the keyboard and I'm going to work and until I finish working,

25:58.200 --> 25:59.200
it's completely flawless.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.200
There's been no issues.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.400
I've been able to produce multiple shows on it.

26:02.400 --> 26:05.940
I did some quick editing on it the other day under KDM Live.

26:05.940 --> 26:07.680
It was nailing it, checking all the boxes.

26:07.680 --> 26:14.520
So if you've been considering trying the Plasma Desktop 5.9, really good release.

26:14.520 --> 26:19.560
One of the things I'm really loving is the notification for screenshots is great.

26:19.560 --> 26:22.320
It just feels so good, Wes.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.600
It feels so good.

26:23.600 --> 26:25.080
So 5.9.1 is out.

26:25.080 --> 26:28.960
Mumbleroom, does anybody want to jump in on the whole plasma love thing before I move

26:28.960 --> 26:29.960
on?

26:29.960 --> 26:30.960
I just want to give them a quick shout out.

26:30.960 --> 26:31.960
Would you be willing to try it?

26:31.960 --> 26:32.960
Yeah.

26:32.960 --> 26:33.960
Oh, absolutely I would.

26:33.960 --> 26:34.960
Yeah?

26:34.960 --> 26:35.960
All right.

26:35.960 --> 26:36.960
I'll get that going this week.

26:36.960 --> 26:37.960
You should.

26:37.960 --> 26:38.960
Yeah.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.120
Just give it a go and see what you think because I actually – I think in my head, even though

26:41.120 --> 26:46.500
I know better, I think in my head I got the idea that the KDE whole application suite

26:46.500 --> 26:52.320
and the Plasma Desktop specifically were slow and bloated and the little test I did this

26:52.320 --> 26:57.360
past weekend for the Linux Action Show, I threw it on a 10-year-old PC and just blown

26:57.360 --> 26:58.360
away by the performance.

26:58.360 --> 27:01.500
I mean I'm consistently impressed like when we talk about articles about KWin and other

27:01.500 --> 27:02.500
parts of the stack.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.360
There's a lot of KDE applications I like already.

27:04.360 --> 27:05.360
Yeah.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.360
There's a lot to that stack too though.

27:06.360 --> 27:07.360
There is.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.360
That's true.

27:08.360 --> 27:12.000
I feel like the whole thing is getting to the point where I can just drop it on here.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
I feel like it's getting there.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
All right.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
Scrapjaw, you want to jump in?

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
Yeah.

27:16.000 --> 27:20.680
I switched my mom over to Linux about a year ago and I switched her over to Neon.

27:20.680 --> 27:26.240
She has it hooked up to an external TV in her family room and she uses it all the time.

27:26.240 --> 27:27.920
She thinks it's actually a lot better.

27:27.920 --> 27:28.920
She was on –

27:28.920 --> 27:29.920
Oh, cool.

27:29.920 --> 27:30.920
– elementary.

27:30.920 --> 27:33.680
She was on elementary but then it was too simple.

27:33.680 --> 27:37.880
So because she's used to Windows and it has more of that classic desktop feel, everything's

27:37.880 --> 27:40.800
right where she likes to – or where she can find it.

27:40.800 --> 27:41.800
Yeah.

27:41.800 --> 27:42.800
Producer Michael, you were going to jump in there.

27:42.800 --> 27:43.800
Go ahead.

27:43.800 --> 27:44.800
Oh, yeah.

27:44.800 --> 27:45.800
Sorry.

27:45.800 --> 27:51.040
I was just going to say that KDE's approach to the whole framework and Plasma itself is

27:51.040 --> 27:54.960
changing to a modular style so you don't need the whole stack of KDE in order to use

27:54.960 --> 27:55.960
certain pieces of it.

27:55.960 --> 28:01.260
So a lot of it's being – like you'll need KWin for Plasma.

28:01.260 --> 28:02.360
You kind of need that.

28:02.360 --> 28:06.680
But the individual apps are no longer needing the full stack to install them.

28:06.680 --> 28:07.680
Yeah.

28:07.680 --> 28:13.160
So I think you have – for me on Arch, I have sort of – I've done like a minimal

28:13.160 --> 28:16.640
or smaller Plasma desktop install which I think is sort of kind of what you're talking

28:16.640 --> 28:17.640
about.

28:17.640 --> 28:18.640
Like I didn't have to install all of it.

28:18.640 --> 28:19.640
Right.

28:19.640 --> 28:24.520
And then when I did Neon, it was – I wouldn't say it was minimal but it was refined.

28:24.520 --> 28:28.880
And one of the other things I really, really appreciate about 5.9 is I'm not spending

28:28.880 --> 28:31.360
all of my time tweaking it anymore.

28:31.360 --> 28:36.440
With past Plasma desktops, especially earlier in the 5 series, I spent a lot of my time

28:36.440 --> 28:42.760
screwing around with Plasma plasmoids and just dorking around with settings, trying

28:42.760 --> 28:46.520
to see if I could create a Unity style desktop or a GNOME style desktop.

28:46.520 --> 28:52.780
And now I'm just basically using mostly defaults, Kabla, Miner, took 10 minutes to

28:52.780 --> 28:56.160
tweak a few things and I've just left it which is not something I've been able to

28:56.160 --> 28:59.040
successfully do in the past with Plasma desktop.

28:59.040 --> 29:00.120
It would irritate me too much.

29:00.120 --> 29:05.400
But now the defaults are really working for me and it's meant that I just get right

29:05.400 --> 29:06.400
to work.

29:06.400 --> 29:07.400
That's awesome.

29:07.400 --> 29:11.480
There's also another benefit to it, like a lot of people are annoyed when an update

29:11.480 --> 29:13.120
happens and it breaks some of their stuff.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.560
KD does not do that.

29:14.560 --> 29:20.040
I've had the same configuration since 5.6.

29:20.040 --> 29:21.040
I have had an update.

29:21.040 --> 29:24.400
I've had something happen with my config, it went all bad and I had to trash it once

29:24.400 --> 29:26.640
but it was so long ago I can't remember anymore.

29:26.640 --> 29:30.880
Well, I mean it since like I create the settings for the applications and the layouts in my

29:30.880 --> 29:35.600
panels however I want them and then I just save the config files for those and then whenever

29:35.600 --> 29:40.440
I make a new, even if I build my system, maybe I can just drop them in and it's all back

29:40.440 --> 29:41.760
to normal where I wanted it.

29:41.760 --> 29:42.760
I like that.

29:42.760 --> 29:45.180
And it's actually been 5.5 since I've had the same thing.

29:45.180 --> 29:49.720
So it's like, it's just, it's a lot more seamless when you transition from one version

29:49.720 --> 29:54.440
to the other, especially when even in like an Arch update where if you have like a big

29:54.440 --> 29:58.160
update for most DEs, you're kind of worried that something might break.

29:58.160 --> 30:00.920
With KDE, it's very unlikely that it will break.

30:00.920 --> 30:01.920
Huh.

30:01.920 --> 30:02.920
Well, I'll see.

30:02.920 --> 30:05.880
All right, MonkeyConf, you want to jump in, go ahead.

30:05.880 --> 30:09.840
Yeah, just don't mess with transparency or you'll mess up your desktop.

30:09.840 --> 30:10.840
Does it crash?

30:10.840 --> 30:11.840
Why?

30:11.840 --> 30:12.840
What do you say?

30:12.840 --> 30:17.600
That's a call out to Rod and we were working, he was trying to show me how to do transparency

30:17.600 --> 30:21.680
and within about 15 minutes I had to do a complete nuke.

30:21.680 --> 30:29.280
I made a video that expresses it specifically that if you do certain things with the transparency

30:29.280 --> 30:34.040
and you have certain settings, it can make it weird, but I also provided a warning, don't

30:34.040 --> 30:35.040
do this.

30:35.040 --> 30:41.200
And I pointed out that if you do certain things in KDE and KWin, it will go, hey, maybe don't

30:41.200 --> 30:42.200
do that.

30:42.200 --> 30:45.800
Did you actually drop that level of sugar to the Linux community?

30:45.800 --> 30:46.800
Are you serious?

30:46.800 --> 30:49.480
We're all going to do it.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.580
My entire point is to say, hey, this is really cool.

30:51.580 --> 30:55.200
You can do this, but you should know what you're doing before you do it because it could

30:55.200 --> 30:56.200
be weird.

30:56.200 --> 30:59.560
There isn't a feature in KWin where you can say, force this setting.

30:59.560 --> 31:04.080
If you force this setting on all of the windows for all of the applications, you could globally

31:04.080 --> 31:08.920
break your system in the visibility of things.

31:08.920 --> 31:12.580
You should learn the KWin structure before you start messing with that.

31:12.580 --> 31:17.400
So I made a video that walks people through how to do it more safely.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.640
Good idea.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.440
So that's what he's referring to.

31:22.440 --> 31:28.240
It's not as bad as it seems, but if you jump all in with not knowing what you're doing,

31:28.240 --> 31:30.320
it could be weird.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.000
With great power.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.800
So is there a Scrapjaw you want to jump in about OpenGL, it might fit with the KWin discussion?

31:36.800 --> 31:44.160
Yeah, when I did the 5.9 update on my mom's computer, she has an older AMD graphics card

31:44.160 --> 31:48.880
on there, and any time a window, it does that little transparent thing when they come up

31:48.880 --> 31:51.860
and go away, it would flicker really bad.

31:51.860 --> 31:57.140
So I went into the compositor to see, okay, maybe I can just turn off all of that stuff.

31:57.140 --> 32:00.920
And I noticed that it had the option for OpenGL 2 and 3.

32:00.920 --> 32:03.200
I moved it to 3, and it was fine.

32:03.200 --> 32:04.200
Oh, good.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.720
So just a little nugget there.

32:06.720 --> 32:10.520
I have not really messed with KWin settings either this time around.

32:10.520 --> 32:11.840
I attempted to go in there and take a look.

32:11.840 --> 32:12.840
Are you installing right now?

32:12.840 --> 32:13.840
Whoa, you've already got it loaded.

32:13.840 --> 32:14.840
Done.

32:14.840 --> 32:15.840
That was quick.

32:15.840 --> 32:19.720
I mean, I did launch it from GDM, so maybe that's heresy, but it worked.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.960
And we're doing that right now, too, upstairs, so.

32:21.960 --> 32:24.240
Wow, so did you do the Plasma meta?

32:24.240 --> 32:25.240
What did you do?

32:25.240 --> 32:26.240
Just Plasma desktop?

32:26.240 --> 32:27.240
I just did the Plasma group.

32:27.240 --> 32:28.240
I just did Plasma.

32:28.240 --> 32:29.240
Oh, okay, good.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.240
Good.

32:30.240 --> 32:31.240
Very good.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.240
Very good.

32:32.240 --> 32:33.880
So hey, we can chat about how it goes next week.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.200
We'll be Plasma buddies next week.

32:36.200 --> 32:42.560
So I want to shift gears and talk about something that runs on Linux that sounds like a Hollywood

32:42.560 --> 32:43.560
trope.

32:43.560 --> 32:47.080
It sounds like, in fact, this video sort of summarizes this old, old Hollywood trope.

32:47.080 --> 32:48.080
You all know.

32:48.080 --> 32:49.080
Whoa, hi there.

32:49.080 --> 32:50.080
That's not the video.

32:50.080 --> 32:51.080
Whoa.

32:51.080 --> 32:52.080
That's a different video.

32:52.080 --> 32:53.080
Bound chicken brown cow.

32:53.080 --> 32:58.760
You all know this Hollywood trope where they've been able to see in the reflection of somebody's

32:58.760 --> 33:05.240
eyeball the license plate of a car, or the typical zoom-in-in-hands BS stuff.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.840
Well, it's no longer BS stuff.

33:07.840 --> 33:18.440
Okay, now let's get a good look at you.

33:18.440 --> 33:19.440
Hold it.

33:19.440 --> 33:20.440
Run that back.

33:20.440 --> 33:21.440
Wait a minute.

33:21.440 --> 33:22.440
Go right.

33:22.440 --> 33:23.440
There.

33:23.440 --> 33:24.440
Freeze that.

33:24.440 --> 33:25.440
Full screen.

33:25.440 --> 33:26.440
Okay, freeze that.

33:26.440 --> 33:27.440
Tighten up on that wheel.

33:27.440 --> 33:28.440
Vector in on that guy by the back wheel.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.160
Zoom in right here on this spot.

33:31.160 --> 33:34.200
With the right equipment, the image could be enlarged and sharpened.

33:34.200 --> 33:35.200
What's that?

33:35.200 --> 33:36.760
Does it enhance my program?

33:36.760 --> 33:38.320
Can you clear that up any?

33:38.320 --> 33:39.880
I don't know.

33:39.880 --> 33:41.080
Let's enhance it.

33:41.080 --> 33:42.080
Enhance section A-6.

33:42.080 --> 33:43.080
I enhanced the detail, and...

33:43.080 --> 33:44.080
I think there's enough to enhance.

33:44.080 --> 33:45.080
Release it to my screen.

33:45.080 --> 33:48.880
I enhanced the reflection in her eye.

33:48.880 --> 33:50.360
Let's run this through video enhancement.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.360
Edgar, can you enhance this?

33:51.360 --> 33:52.360
Hang on.

33:52.360 --> 33:55.880
I've been working on this reflection.

33:55.880 --> 33:56.880
Someone's reflection.

33:56.880 --> 33:57.880
The reflection.

33:57.880 --> 33:58.880
There's a reflection of the man's face.

33:58.880 --> 33:59.880
The reflection.

33:59.880 --> 34:00.880
There's a reflection.

34:00.880 --> 34:01.880
Zoom in on the mirror.

34:01.880 --> 34:02.880
You can see a reflection.

34:02.880 --> 34:03.880
Can you enhance the image from here?

34:03.880 --> 34:04.880
Can you enhance him right here?

34:04.880 --> 34:05.880
Can you enhance it?

34:05.880 --> 34:06.880
Can you enhance it?

34:06.880 --> 34:07.880
Can we enhance this?

34:07.880 --> 34:08.880
Can you enhance it?

34:08.880 --> 34:09.880
Hold on a second.

34:09.880 --> 34:10.880
I'll enhance.

34:10.880 --> 34:11.880
Zoom in on the door.

34:11.880 --> 34:12.880
Times 10.

34:12.880 --> 34:13.880
Zoom.

34:13.880 --> 34:14.880
Move in.

34:14.880 --> 34:15.880
More.

34:15.880 --> 34:16.880
Wait.

34:16.880 --> 34:17.880
Stop.

34:17.880 --> 34:18.880
Stop.

34:18.880 --> 34:19.880
Pause it.

34:19.880 --> 34:20.880
Rotate us 75 degrees around the vertical, please.

34:20.880 --> 34:21.880
Stop.

34:21.880 --> 34:25.760
And go back to the part about the door again.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.360
Got an image enhancer that can bitmap?

34:27.360 --> 34:30.440
Maybe we can use the Pradeep Sen method to see into the windows.

34:30.440 --> 34:32.000
This software is state of the art.

34:32.000 --> 34:36.000
The eigenvalue is off with the right combination of algorithms.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.640
He's taken elimination algorithms to the next level, and I can use them to enhance this

34:39.640 --> 34:40.640
photograph.

34:40.640 --> 34:42.640
Lock on and enlarge the Z-axis.

34:42.640 --> 34:43.640
Enhance.

34:43.640 --> 34:44.640
Enhance.

34:44.640 --> 34:45.640
Freeze and enhance.

34:45.640 --> 34:46.640
Freeze and enhance.

34:46.640 --> 34:53.840
Yeah, so, pretty much the biggest trope ever in Hollywood and, of course, the cop drama

34:53.840 --> 34:54.840
shows.

34:54.840 --> 34:55.920
And Google's making it a reality.

34:55.920 --> 35:01.040
It's called the super resolution Google Brain, and Google Brain has devised some new software

35:01.040 --> 35:05.200
that can create detailed images from tiny pixelated source images.

35:05.200 --> 35:09.880
Google software, in short, basically means zoom in, now enhance is possible.

35:09.880 --> 35:14.640
The first part, the conditioning network, tries to map the 8x8 source image against other

35:14.640 --> 35:16.400
high resolution images.

35:16.400 --> 35:21.320
It downsizes other high resolution images to 8x8 and then tries to make a match.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.400
And they have some examples here.

35:23.400 --> 35:27.880
Then the second part, the prior network uses an implementation of pixel CNN to try and

35:27.880 --> 35:33.120
add realistic high resolution details to the 8x8 source image.

35:33.120 --> 35:36.960
Basically the prior network ingests a large number of high res real images of celebrities

35:36.960 --> 35:40.280
in bedrooms, in this case, to match, I guess.

35:40.280 --> 35:44.320
Then when the source image is upscaled, it tries to add new pixels that match what it

35:44.320 --> 35:47.480
knows about the class of image.

35:47.480 --> 35:51.960
To create the final super resolution image, the output from the two neural networks are

35:51.960 --> 35:57.560
then mashed together and the end result usually contains a plausible addition of new details.

35:57.560 --> 36:02.260
Google's Brain super resolution technique was reasonably successful in real world testing.

36:02.260 --> 36:05.880
Now this is going to raise interesting questions and that's why I really hope things like this

36:05.880 --> 36:11.240
are open source because think about this, it's not getting the real image, it's adding

36:11.240 --> 36:16.560
details which are literally called hallucinations in image processing jargon.

36:16.560 --> 36:19.080
They're best guesses, nothing more.

36:19.080 --> 36:23.200
This raises some intriguing issues, especially in the realm of surveillance and forensics.

36:23.200 --> 36:28.720
This technique could take a blurry image of a suspect, add more detail, you zoom and enhance,

36:28.720 --> 36:30.760
but it wouldn't actually be a real photo of the suspect.

36:30.760 --> 36:32.440
Why, that looks like you, Chris.

36:32.440 --> 36:33.440
Right.

36:33.440 --> 36:34.720
Yeah, that is a little disconcerting.

36:34.720 --> 36:39.480
So, for some things it seems possible, but for that exact use case, it's like, no, this

36:39.480 --> 36:41.000
is not the technology that we want.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
I agree.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.480
It seems like you would really want, and if you do start to, if this thing would start

36:45.480 --> 36:48.640
to ever end up in like law enforcement, you might want it to be open source.

36:48.640 --> 36:49.640
Oh, yes.

36:49.640 --> 36:50.640
Oh, get out.

36:50.640 --> 36:51.640
Can you imagine that?

36:51.640 --> 36:53.440
Like you're convicted of a crime that you were...

36:53.440 --> 36:54.760
Not actually at the crime scene.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.440
And some software gets to make up the image, you know.

36:57.440 --> 36:58.920
Google at that at this point.

36:58.920 --> 36:59.920
Oh, man.

36:59.920 --> 37:01.960
That's just a scary one.

37:01.960 --> 37:03.960
That is your scary story of the day.

37:03.960 --> 37:04.960
Yeah.

37:04.960 --> 37:05.960
That is pretty freaky.

37:05.960 --> 37:06.960
All right.

37:06.960 --> 37:07.960
Yeah.

37:07.960 --> 37:11.760
Well, obviously, Scrapjaw asks if it would be admissible in court.

37:11.760 --> 37:12.760
No, not now.

37:12.760 --> 37:13.760
This is a future thing.

37:13.760 --> 37:14.760
Go ahead.

37:14.760 --> 37:20.400
Well, this is the reason I want this to become like a mainstream thing that everybody uses,

37:20.400 --> 37:21.400
right?

37:21.400 --> 37:24.320
That it gets dismissed as something that can be used in court.

37:24.320 --> 37:29.240
It's something only accessible to some people, then yes, it will be admissible to court because

37:29.240 --> 37:31.600
they will say, well, the software's not really that admissible.

37:31.600 --> 37:34.160
It's only used in this kind of scenarios.

37:34.160 --> 37:37.360
We're taking all precaution about it.

37:37.360 --> 37:42.000
If it's in the masses and anybody could fake an image, everybody will be easily contesting

37:42.000 --> 37:46.680
it as validity for evidence, and then it will be much easier to actually dismiss it as not

37:46.680 --> 37:47.680
valid evidence.

37:47.680 --> 37:48.680
Yeah.

37:48.680 --> 37:49.680
Yeah.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.720
I wonder if it would be treated like the polygraph because I've heard a lot of people say the

37:51.720 --> 37:52.720
polygraph is crap.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.080
I don't know if that's true or not.

37:54.080 --> 37:55.080
I mean, who knows?

37:55.080 --> 37:56.080
I don't know.

37:56.080 --> 37:57.760
I've never taken a polygraph, so I can't say.

37:57.760 --> 38:00.480
Polygraphs have taken the polygraph before.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.760
It is good to give you an indication.

38:02.760 --> 38:10.600
Now, if the individual is already aware and has done it before multiple times, the more

38:10.600 --> 38:15.880
you do it, the less intense is the fact that you're doing the test, the less it actually

38:15.880 --> 38:16.880
can detect.

38:16.880 --> 38:21.200
It requires also an expert examiner to actually look at the results of the polygraph, which

38:21.200 --> 38:23.240
is another issue as well.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.680
So you have to see this individual.

38:25.680 --> 38:26.680
It doesn't work at all.

38:26.680 --> 38:34.080
It doesn't work because it shows someone's anxiety, their blood pressure, it doesn't

38:34.080 --> 38:35.080
show whether they're lying.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.080
Yeah.

38:36.080 --> 38:41.200
If you are super chill, then no matter what you say, it will just say that you're chill.

38:41.200 --> 38:43.840
So that's the other thing, though.

38:43.840 --> 38:49.280
However, we have subtle changes that this was supposed to detect, and this is why it

38:49.280 --> 38:52.920
also requires an expert examiner to be able to know those subtle changes.

38:52.920 --> 38:59.600
Also, it has to do with the timing, and it has to have precise timing on answer to response

38:59.600 --> 39:00.600
of the polygraph examination.

39:00.600 --> 39:03.460
There's been decades of research proving that it doesn't work.

39:03.460 --> 39:06.880
So we should pick this up in the post-show, but I think MiniMech points out, going back

39:06.880 --> 39:11.760
to the Google brain thing, MiniMech, you have a great point of why perhaps Google would

39:11.760 --> 39:14.920
want long-term to be in the Google Photos game.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.400
I mean, yeah, you have a huge photo base.

39:17.400 --> 39:21.200
You have all the Android devices that are storing their photos on the cloud.

39:21.200 --> 39:26.640
So you have that Google brain just measure the physiognomy of your face.

39:26.640 --> 39:31.600
And so that would be a good base to recognize future criminals or everything.

39:31.600 --> 39:34.600
Oh, let me go check my upload status real quick.

39:34.600 --> 39:35.600
Yeah.

39:35.600 --> 39:36.600
Yikes!

39:36.600 --> 39:37.600
That's a...

39:37.600 --> 39:38.600
Oh, okay.

39:38.600 --> 39:39.600
All right.

39:39.600 --> 39:40.600
So let's move on.

39:40.600 --> 39:41.600
We can pick up the...

39:41.600 --> 39:45.560
I wouldn't mind picking up the whole discussion about the lie detector.

39:45.560 --> 39:46.560
Yeah, absolutely.

39:46.560 --> 39:49.560
Because I'm always fascinated by that.

39:49.560 --> 39:54.560
Now, last gripping note, it could also be useful as terms of saving bandwidth and space.

39:54.560 --> 39:59.880
So if you can recreate the image with some base, a smaller image that you're storing,

39:59.880 --> 40:00.880
that could be beneficial.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.960
What about also partial file recovery?

40:02.960 --> 40:04.760
Maybe you recover an image file.

40:04.760 --> 40:10.240
I had recently, I formatted an SD card accidentally and lost a day's worth of footage and tried

40:10.240 --> 40:14.240
to do file recovery, but essentially managing the files back, but they were messed up.

40:14.240 --> 40:17.800
So you're kind of like, you're working on your essay, it gets corrupted, then it restores

40:17.800 --> 40:20.440
again, well, it's like, it's probably an okay essay.

40:20.440 --> 40:22.320
This would be great if it could work for text.

40:22.320 --> 40:23.320
Yeah.

40:23.320 --> 40:25.920
Oh, man, journalism is never going to be the same.

40:25.920 --> 40:26.920
All right.

40:26.920 --> 40:31.600
Well, before we go any further, let's take a moment and I wanted to mention Linux Academy.

40:31.600 --> 40:36.840

Our scenario based server labs and quiz system allow you to learn hands-on.

41:47.880 --> 41:53.320
We also have full time human instructors who answer questions and help you earn that certification

41:53.320 --> 41:54.960
or promotion at work.

41:54.960 --> 41:59.560
We add new training every week so you'll always be up to date on the latest tech.

41:59.560 --> 42:04.660
Sys admins of every experience level use Linux Academy to stay on the bleeding edge of the

42:04.660 --> 42:06.240
Linux ecosystem.

42:06.240 --> 42:07.240
You should too.

42:07.240 --> 42:12.360
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

42:12.360 --> 42:15.880
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

42:15.880 --> 42:18.280
Check it out and sign up for a free seven day trial.

42:18.280 --> 42:22.200
Really quickly before we get into the thing that I really want to talk about this week,

42:22.200 --> 42:25.680
there is an update for those of you out there running Windows 10 called the, I guess it's

42:25.680 --> 42:27.240
called the anniversary update.

42:27.240 --> 42:28.240
Is this what we do now?

42:28.240 --> 42:29.240
We don't call it service pack one anymore?

42:29.240 --> 42:31.000
It's an anniversary, Chris.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.680
That's a much more special occasion.

42:32.680 --> 42:35.400
It's not because there's a bunch of things that need to fix.

42:35.400 --> 42:41.760
So there is, I guess, a bug that sort of screws you if you're running Ubuntu.

42:41.760 --> 42:48.800
The Windows Update 10 anniversary bug updates Windows 10 and wipes out Ubuntu Linux partitions.

42:48.800 --> 42:52.520
So I think what happened is, in this case, this guy was actually running Linux off of

42:52.520 --> 42:56.200
a real partition, possibly.

42:56.200 --> 42:59.000
I've never used this system, so I have no idea what I'm actually talking about when

42:59.000 --> 43:02.960
it comes to running Linux on Windows, but based on his stack exchange, or I'm sorry,

43:02.960 --> 43:08.480
askubuntu.com post, it looks like he was running it off of a real deal partition.

43:08.480 --> 43:09.960
That's genuine Linux.

43:09.960 --> 43:13.680
Yeah, and then this anniversary update just nuked it.

43:13.680 --> 43:16.600
So if you're doing this, consider reading this post we have in the show notes.

43:16.600 --> 43:18.800
We probably don't need to say more than that, right?

43:18.800 --> 43:19.800
That's just kind of a...

43:19.800 --> 43:20.800
I think that's it.

43:20.800 --> 43:21.800
Yeah, that's kind of it.

43:21.800 --> 43:25.640
I also noticed this week, before we go any further, it was an interesting week for...

43:25.640 --> 43:28.120
Oh, well, oh, Scrapjaw, you had it happen to you.

43:28.120 --> 43:29.120
Well then, tell us details.

43:29.120 --> 43:30.120
Give us the deets.

43:30.120 --> 43:33.240
Perhaps you can give us the 411 on the bug.

43:33.240 --> 43:34.240
Scrapjaw?

43:34.240 --> 43:36.560
Oh, sorry, Scrapjaw, I had you muted.

43:36.560 --> 43:37.560
Start again.

43:37.560 --> 43:38.560
That was my bad.

43:38.560 --> 43:39.560
Yeah.

43:39.560 --> 43:46.300
My wife uses it most of the time on Windows 10, so I don't normally mess with it.

43:46.300 --> 43:49.920
So it did its little reboot thing, like it likes to do on its own, and then when it came

43:49.920 --> 43:53.200
back up, it skipped the grub.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.300
My grub was gone.

43:55.300 --> 43:59.200
And then when I went in to try to find it, I was like, okay, I'll just put in the USB

43:59.200 --> 44:04.280
boot and I'll redo grub, and then grub was like, hey, all I can see is Windows, there's

44:04.280 --> 44:05.280
nothing else here.

44:05.280 --> 44:10.880
And then it found out that it was a really hard process because my Linux was installed

44:10.880 --> 44:14.640
in one of those extended partitions, because there's only one drive, and you can only have

44:14.640 --> 44:15.920
so many primary partitions.

44:15.920 --> 44:18.380
Right, right, because this is the Dark Ages, right.

44:18.380 --> 44:26.080
So an extenuating process of going through live boots with Gparted and using some other

44:26.080 --> 44:32.400
command line stuff, and eventually I ended up just having to rebuild the partition tables

44:32.400 --> 44:35.760
where they were, and it was hard.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.840
And I couldn't even begin to...

44:37.840 --> 44:42.840
I put it somewhere where some other people had the problem, it's on a forum, I'll try

44:42.840 --> 44:44.400
to dig up the link.

44:44.400 --> 44:46.280
I did document it.

44:46.280 --> 44:49.080
Microsoft loves Linux so much that they couldn't take the time to test this.

44:49.080 --> 44:51.600
Ike, you said it also screws with UEFI?

44:51.600 --> 44:56.400
Yeah, we've had a couple of people reporting now on the forums and on Reddit after they've

44:56.400 --> 44:58.320
had the anniversary update.

44:58.320 --> 45:02.960
Not only is the bootloader gone from the ESP, it's also taken out the EFI variables.

45:02.960 --> 45:07.000
So even if they do restore the files, it doesn't matter if the variables have gone.

45:07.000 --> 45:12.200
So for most of the people, they're not comfortable doing a true repair, so they're having to

45:12.200 --> 45:14.740
do full reinstallations now because of it.

45:14.740 --> 45:18.480
You know, I don't think Microsoft gets the idea what anniversaries are about.

45:18.480 --> 45:19.480
They're a bad lover.

45:19.480 --> 45:20.800
They do not get this.

45:20.800 --> 45:21.800
They spend time together.

45:21.800 --> 45:22.800
Yeah.

45:22.800 --> 45:23.800
Happy anniversary.

45:23.800 --> 45:24.800
Let me burn down the house.

45:24.800 --> 45:25.800
Yeah.

45:25.800 --> 45:26.800
God.

45:26.800 --> 45:30.080
Before we go any further though, there was a lot of talk this week, surprise, get ready

45:30.080 --> 45:31.840
for this guys, about containers.

45:31.840 --> 45:35.640
But the reason why I wanted to mention it is because they're just on such opposite ends

45:35.640 --> 45:38.080
of the spectrum that I just think it's adorable.

45:38.080 --> 45:43.960
So this first article over at opensource.com is performance made easy with Linux containers

45:43.960 --> 45:48.560
and goes into different ways to get response time under peak load down, ease of use, getting

45:48.560 --> 45:52.400
it supportable, operational cost, figuring out your CPU needs.

45:52.400 --> 45:56.360
It's a good article for people that are going to be deploying containers in production and

45:56.360 --> 45:57.360
maybe have it.

45:57.360 --> 45:58.360
Yeah, it's high level.

45:58.360 --> 45:59.360
High level.

45:59.360 --> 46:00.360
Yeah, it is.

46:00.360 --> 46:02.240
Then there was another article, or actually done an article, it's a site they launched

46:02.240 --> 46:06.720
that I like a lot, containerhardening.org, which is a project that focuses on hardening

46:06.720 --> 46:12.740
Linux containers and is going to contribute patches to the kernel self-protection project.

46:12.740 --> 46:15.520
And they say they're going to help try to benefit all container runtimes by keeping

46:15.520 --> 46:19.560
the focus on improving the kernel and the subsystems used by the containers.

46:19.560 --> 46:20.560
I like this.

46:20.560 --> 46:21.560
I like that as well.

46:21.560 --> 46:24.480
I think there's a lot of people that would argue that probably should have started with

46:24.480 --> 46:25.480
security first.

46:25.480 --> 46:26.480
Yeah, yeah.

46:26.480 --> 46:27.480
And I'm not here to invalidate that.

46:27.480 --> 46:30.240
But hey, this is going to be, if anything comes of it, it's going to be a lot better

46:30.240 --> 46:31.240
than nothing.

46:31.240 --> 46:32.240
Hey, Alan, could you let Wes back?

46:32.240 --> 46:33.240
Yes.

46:33.240 --> 46:34.240
There you go.

46:34.240 --> 46:37.680
And then on the other end of the spectrum, Richard Brown, who hasn't been on the show

46:37.680 --> 46:42.060
for a while but has been on the show in the past, had a talk at Fosdom who warned everybody

46:42.060 --> 46:47.440
at Fosdom that containerized applications would be as bad as Windows applications with

46:47.440 --> 46:51.840
DLL hell and everything is going to be ruined.

46:51.840 --> 46:54.960
Containerized application technologies like AppImage, Snacky, and Flatback promise a brave

46:54.960 --> 46:59.040
new world for Linux applications, free from the worries of shared libraries and dependency

46:59.040 --> 47:00.160
issues.

47:00.160 --> 47:01.880
But there's just one problem.

47:01.880 --> 47:06.600
This is a road long traveled before, such as in the application dark ages of Win32 applications

47:06.600 --> 47:07.600
and DLLs.

47:07.600 --> 47:11.840
And it just worked out so wonderfully there.

47:11.840 --> 47:14.400
And I will link you to Richard's talk.

47:14.400 --> 47:16.280
You can listen to the whole thing.

47:16.280 --> 47:17.280
It's not long.

47:17.280 --> 47:18.680
It's just a great little talk if you want to catch it.

47:18.680 --> 47:22.680
Although, spoiler alert, I'm betting OpenSUSE of Build Service fixes everything.

47:22.680 --> 47:23.680
I bet it does.

47:23.680 --> 47:29.000
So you could probably just skip to the end there and probably just save yourself the

47:29.000 --> 47:30.000
long journey.

47:30.000 --> 47:36.000
I find this whole thing of we now have this gray area of containers that are Docker images

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
and LXD containers.

47:37.000 --> 47:41.960
And then we have people calling containers that are things like snap packages that install

47:41.960 --> 47:48.080
and cheroot themselves and have a mounted file system or Flatpaks that are kind of containers,

47:48.080 --> 47:50.720
but they're not really containers.

47:50.720 --> 47:53.440
This whole thing is like people have barely wrapped their head around it.

47:53.440 --> 47:56.500
It didn't mean anything before, and now it means even less.

47:56.500 --> 47:58.040
That's what I'm trying to say.

47:58.040 --> 48:01.200
That's exactly what I'm trying to say, is it means even less, and now we're getting

48:01.200 --> 48:04.400
upset to here's how to optimize and make it better.

48:04.400 --> 48:10.920
And we're not even using the same shared language, which is really kind of odd in the Linux open

48:10.920 --> 48:21.480
source community where they start to have this weird hyperbole abstract language.

48:21.480 --> 48:24.920
Usually we're very technically focused.

48:24.920 --> 48:25.920
We call things...

48:25.920 --> 48:26.920
Maybe overly technical.

48:26.920 --> 48:32.280
I guess maybe what we should start doing is start using the very technical term for these

48:32.280 --> 48:33.280
things.

48:33.280 --> 48:37.160
If it's a container, if it's really more like a cheroot, call it a cheroot.

48:37.160 --> 48:41.980
And if it's more like just all the processes get tagged with a name, well then it's really

48:41.980 --> 48:43.040
using namespaces.

48:43.040 --> 48:45.280
It's not really a container.

48:45.280 --> 48:50.600
Let's start using very specific language here because everybody's telling me all different

48:50.600 --> 48:51.600
things.

48:51.600 --> 48:52.820
It's going to solve all of our problems.

48:52.820 --> 48:57.760
It's going to be the only way to scale, or it's going to be win 32 hell.

48:57.760 --> 48:58.760
It's just a mess.

48:58.760 --> 49:02.880
It's just a hot mess this week, and I'll link to it all if you want to indulge.

49:02.880 --> 49:05.960
In the meantime, let's talk about lots of different options, from containers to just

49:05.960 --> 49:09.000
running it right up on their systems, digitalocean.com.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.840
Use our promo code over at DigitalOcean to get a $10 credit, SnapOcean.

49:12.840 --> 49:14.400
It's one word, SnapOcean.

49:14.400 --> 49:15.600
What?

49:15.600 --> 49:16.600
That's your promo code.

49:16.600 --> 49:17.920
I think I'm thinking about TechSnap.

49:17.920 --> 49:20.360
Did you know, by the way, SnapOcean?

49:20.360 --> 49:22.800
TechSnap, SnapOcean, coming up just a little bit after this show.

49:22.800 --> 49:23.800
That's right, it is.

49:23.800 --> 49:24.800
It is coming up a little bit after this show.

49:24.800 --> 49:25.800
Actually, you could use it.

49:25.800 --> 49:28.880
The thing about DigitalOcean is they're so great, there's just a ton of promo codes.

49:28.880 --> 49:32.000
I guess you could use SnapOcean for this week, and then next week-

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
Next week.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.240
If you haven't signed up yet, sign up and then use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

49:36.240 --> 49:37.240
One word, lowercase.

49:37.240 --> 49:38.240
But maybe this week.

49:38.240 --> 49:39.240
How about Wes?

49:39.240 --> 49:41.800
If you're going to spin up a rig this week, SnapOcean.

49:41.800 --> 49:45.580
Create the account, you go over there, you sign up, you create the account, then once

49:45.580 --> 49:50.640
your account's ready, you apply that SnapOcean, or DOUNPLUGGED, to your account, and you get

49:50.640 --> 49:51.640
the $10 credit.

49:51.640 --> 49:54.760
Now, they got a $5 a month rig, they also have hourly pricing, so this is a great way

49:54.760 --> 49:58.680
to experiment with different projects, try different services, or really build back an

49:58.680 --> 50:00.260
infrastructure that works for you.

50:00.260 --> 50:03.880
Or just on-demand scaling, too, which is made even easier with a really straightforward

50:03.880 --> 50:07.320
API and very, very, very intuitive control panel.

50:07.320 --> 50:11.680
They also have an HTML5 console that goes from post all the way up to login, which gives

50:11.680 --> 50:13.040
you a lot of options.

50:13.040 --> 50:17.580
They make it easy to integrate teams and add multiple SSH keys and set up the DNS and deploy

50:17.580 --> 50:21.000
multiple rigs at once and take snapshots and revert.

50:21.000 --> 50:27.000
There's so many great community-contributed articles, like I was just looking at one before

50:27.000 --> 50:32.960
the show, how to set up an Apache virtual host on Debian 8, submitted 23 hours ago.

50:32.960 --> 50:34.560
Really well-structured guide.

50:34.560 --> 50:36.120
Not really DigitalOcean-specific, either.

50:36.120 --> 50:39.520
I tried to pick out some of the ones that anybody can use.

50:39.520 --> 50:44.320
If you're foolish enough to use another cloud provider, maybe you still have a dedicated

50:44.320 --> 50:49.760
box somewhere and you haven't gotten on to the revolutions, but hey, those docs are still

50:49.760 --> 50:50.760
worth a lot.

50:50.760 --> 50:51.760
Yeah, they are.

50:51.760 --> 50:52.760
They're so nice.

50:52.760 --> 50:55.720
There's also complete application stacks ready to go if you want to just deploy those, but

50:55.720 --> 50:56.720
check it out.

50:56.720 --> 51:00.280
Go to techsnap.com and help out the new TechSnap program by using the promo code SNAPOCEAN

51:00.280 --> 51:05.280
this week, or keep this show going by using the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

51:05.280 --> 51:07.080
Well, you will get helped out either way.

51:07.080 --> 51:08.080
I know.

51:08.080 --> 51:11.160
Look at you with the double Tuesday Wes.

51:11.160 --> 51:12.880
It's a good time to show up live on the show.

51:12.880 --> 51:13.880
Yes, it is.

51:13.880 --> 51:17.280
Because you get here, you get to hang out with Unplugged, you can join us in the mumble

51:17.280 --> 51:21.080
room if you want, and then you wind down with a little Wes and Dan doing TechSnap.

51:21.080 --> 51:22.080
It's nice.

51:22.080 --> 51:23.080
That's what I do.

51:23.080 --> 51:24.080
It's pretty much what I do.

51:24.080 --> 51:28.600
So this came in from Vladimir, I'm sorry, it's Vermeer.

51:28.600 --> 51:29.600
It's not Vladimir Putin.

51:29.600 --> 51:30.600
Vermeer?

51:30.600 --> 51:31.600
Vladimir Putin?

51:31.600 --> 51:35.480
It came in to the show, Noah is right, which is always a good way to get my attention.

51:35.480 --> 51:36.480
Yep.

51:36.480 --> 51:37.480
And probably Noah's attention too.

51:37.480 --> 51:38.480
How could you not buy it at that?

51:38.480 --> 51:44.100
Solus will always be a boutique distro, and there is such a thing as finished software.

51:44.100 --> 51:48.660
So he says, I have this laptop, I take it to meetings on site, he says, I tried out

51:48.660 --> 51:53.960
Solus after all the talk on last, because you guys have been going on and on about it,

51:53.960 --> 51:57.920
and the first thing I thought was, this is pretty good.

51:57.920 --> 52:01.280
There are packages for Sublime Text, Volde, Steam, and loads of other software that had

52:01.280 --> 52:03.740
prevented me from taking it seriously in the past.

52:03.740 --> 52:07.160
For the first day, I thought it might be usable for a work distribution.

52:07.160 --> 52:11.000
I even considered installing it at home until I realized there was exactly zero amateur

52:11.000 --> 52:13.160
radio packages in the repo.

52:13.160 --> 52:16.000
Then on Thursday, I needed to do real work.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.240
My preferred serial terminal emulator is Minicom.

52:19.240 --> 52:20.240
Now guess what?

52:20.240 --> 52:23.760
Minicom, long story short, not in the repo, so I open up a bug report for your software

52:23.760 --> 52:24.760
request for Minicom.

52:24.760 --> 52:29.000
It was promptly closed, because I didn't follow the guidelines for the request exactly.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
My bad.

52:30.000 --> 52:34.840
I reopened the bug with the required information, built the package for myself, and included

52:34.840 --> 52:37.200
the patch, hoping this would help with inclusion.

52:37.200 --> 52:42.040
A few hours later, another user posted to the bug asking why I wouldn't use Bicocom,

52:42.040 --> 52:43.200
which also isn't packaged.

52:43.200 --> 52:48.160
He says, this morning, the bug was closed with the reason it hasn't been released since

52:48.160 --> 52:52.760
2013, clearly not maintained, thus not eligible for inclusion.

52:52.760 --> 52:57.320
Well, for F's sake, is it possible for software to be finished and stable?

52:57.320 --> 53:01.640
A program for emulating serial terminals has essentially zero attack service, and the protocol

53:01.640 --> 53:03.880
hasn't changed since the 90s.

53:03.880 --> 53:07.440
The current release has dependencies on bash and end cursors, and builds fine against the

53:07.440 --> 53:08.440
latest versions.

53:08.440 --> 53:11.760
I was planning on submitting some amateur radio packages so I could use Solus on my

53:11.760 --> 53:16.000
main PC at home, but after this point, I've completely given up.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.440
There's tons of good amateur radio software that will never be allowed in the repos, because,

53:19.440 --> 53:23.280
like Minicom, it's feature complete, finished, and stable.

53:23.280 --> 53:28.320
So instead of wasting energy trying to help, I'm uninstalling.

53:28.320 --> 53:31.400
And then people in the comments timed in, I don't understand the current last obsession

53:31.400 --> 53:32.640
over Solus.

53:32.640 --> 53:35.840
It seems to be just because the developer repairs regularly on Linux unplugged.

53:35.840 --> 53:40.280
I just can't see smaller distributions having the manpower to provide the same long-term

53:40.280 --> 53:47.440
support, software availability, or quality assurance testing as larger distributions.

53:47.440 --> 53:49.600
So I thought this summed up what probably a lot of people are thinking.

53:49.600 --> 53:53.520
Why do we talk about it?

53:53.520 --> 53:58.040
Is finished software such a thing, and why be so strict about how things get included

53:58.040 --> 54:00.680
in a distribution?

54:00.680 --> 54:05.860
And also, I'd like to talk about the over and over thing, and the reoccurring thing

54:05.860 --> 54:08.800
that I think we've talked about on the show in the past.

54:08.800 --> 54:12.840
People when they get into a new project, they sometimes end up at the bug tracker, submit

54:12.840 --> 54:18.040
a bug, and get shut down, and then they rage quit all over the internet about it because

54:18.040 --> 54:22.480
they've been personally violated, their ego has been bruised, and they must take to the

54:22.480 --> 54:28.080
internet and decry this great wrong that has happened to them because they went through

54:28.080 --> 54:31.360
the official process and the bug tracker did them wrong.

54:31.360 --> 54:33.840
This is also something that happens in open source a lot.

54:33.840 --> 54:38.420
So there's a lot to sort of chunk up here, and the first thing I want to start with before

54:38.420 --> 54:45.880
we get into all of it is why I think, for me personally, why I think Solus has a lot

54:45.880 --> 54:51.200
of potential over other more, we'll go with his word, boutique distributions.

54:51.200 --> 54:55.200
Distributions that have a handful of people to one person running them.

54:55.200 --> 54:59.680
I think a lot of it comes down to some of the same reasons I think Ubuntu Mate has done

54:59.680 --> 55:04.600
so well is because people at the top of the project in both these cases seem to really

55:04.600 --> 55:06.920
have their head on straight about certain things.

55:06.920 --> 55:12.560
Sometimes they will take a strong stance on something that seems perhaps like a bad choice

55:12.560 --> 55:15.980
and in the long term be proved it was a right choice.

55:15.980 --> 55:21.480
Sometimes they'll be working on something that was one or two years ahead of other distributions.

55:21.480 --> 55:25.980
In other cases, they're willing to solve problems that the other distributions just seem to

55:25.980 --> 55:27.400
stop at.

55:27.400 --> 55:32.540
For example, Solus with the Steam integration or Wimpy with the Ubuntu Mate tweak that makes

55:32.540 --> 55:38.240
it very simple to recreate experiences and turn on desktop effects in a way that were

55:38.240 --> 55:43.680
almost accomplished in the past but then he really brought it all done with the software,

55:43.680 --> 55:49.820
with his, what is he called, the welcome software selector that really kind of, here's how you

55:49.820 --> 55:53.560
configure your look and here's how you get started on your software and it was like wow,

55:53.560 --> 55:56.480
how come this was the final 10% that nobody else had done?

55:56.480 --> 56:00.120
There's so many things like that in Solus too and so I think a big part of looking at

56:00.120 --> 56:03.280
a distribution and how long they're going to be around is what's the leadership look

56:03.280 --> 56:07.680
like and I think the leadership plays a key role in just like any other factors, user

56:07.680 --> 56:12.960
base, software that their platform they're adopting, momentum, direction, all these things

56:12.960 --> 56:17.520
are important factors and I think Solus along with other distributions that I've mentioned

56:17.520 --> 56:21.440
recently have a unique mix of something interesting going on here.

56:21.440 --> 56:25.200
KDE Neon is another example of this, Ubuntu Mate like I just mentioned, the elementary

56:25.200 --> 56:29.980
project is another example of this, smaller distributions in their own right but doing

56:29.980 --> 56:33.080
something that the larger distributions are not doing.

56:33.080 --> 56:38.880
Now as to why I talk about it so much because this is a show for enthusiasts and I am an

56:38.880 --> 56:44.720
enthusiast, I could sit here and do a show about Red Hat 6 but no one would listen to

56:44.720 --> 56:45.720
it.

56:45.720 --> 56:49.400
I do shows about things that people that follow Linux are interested in, it's a pretty simple

56:49.400 --> 56:53.860
formula, I've been doing it for a long time, it's the same thing and people in this thread

56:53.860 --> 56:56.800
are going after me for saying, oh Chris is always following the new Shiny.

56:56.800 --> 56:59.440
We report on the new shit, that's what we do here.

56:59.440 --> 57:03.680
We talk about this stuff because we're interested in it and you're likely listening to a weekly

57:03.680 --> 57:08.280
Linux podcast because you're interested in things in Linux, you're an enthusiast.

57:08.280 --> 57:09.880
So we talk about those things.

57:09.880 --> 57:14.160
It does sometimes mean maybe we talk more about Solus than I talk about Debian, although

57:14.160 --> 57:19.320
probably not much to be honest but it's close and that does happen.

57:19.320 --> 57:23.560
It also means there's times where we are talking about Debian or Fedora or Ubuntu or Susa or

57:23.560 --> 57:25.420
whatever.

57:25.420 --> 57:31.200
So that's my opening discussion and rationale but Aiki, I invited you to the show today

57:31.200 --> 57:35.540
because I wanted to kind of get your take on this, it's a boutique distribution, it's

57:35.540 --> 57:40.280
too small to be taken seriously stuff and also perhaps I went and filed a bug, didn't

57:40.280 --> 57:42.960
get the answer I want, now everything's ruined.

57:42.960 --> 57:48.360
This seems to be like a rinse repeat thing that I see over and over again on the internet

57:48.360 --> 57:51.080
and I'm wondering from where you're sitting in the district, if you see this kind of stuff,

57:51.080 --> 57:54.480
if you have thoughts on all this stuff, the floor is yours.

57:54.480 --> 57:57.680
Well I mean I have plenty of thoughts on this but let's start at the most basic level.

57:57.680 --> 57:59.580
Let's take the title into consideration.

57:59.580 --> 58:05.040
This is a bug report, rant, complaint, whatever it is, against Solus for being a boutique

58:05.040 --> 58:10.520
distribution and the argument here, the premise is it's a boutique distribution because it

58:10.520 --> 58:14.880
doesn't ship my niche software which isn't applicable to its market.

58:14.880 --> 58:17.200
So you've already started out in the wrong foot.

58:17.200 --> 58:21.040
So the bug report was done wrong first because we have over 600 bugs still open on the tracker

58:21.040 --> 58:22.200
but we're trying to be efficient.

58:22.200 --> 58:24.320
If something's wrong, it gets closed down.

58:24.320 --> 58:25.600
You come back with it.

58:25.600 --> 58:29.760
Now it's come back, it's something that hasn't been maintained since 2013.

58:29.760 --> 58:33.880
Instantly the defense is, well you know, it's finished, there's nothing wrong with it.

58:33.880 --> 58:37.200
So I'm actually going to give you a link here right now on IRC because I have looked into

58:37.200 --> 58:38.200
it.

58:38.200 --> 58:42.240
Now in the past, this package has had two CVEs, it's got over 17 bugs that have been

58:42.240 --> 58:45.280
in the distribution and for the most part it's been good because nobody's looking.

58:45.280 --> 58:46.280
I've looked.

58:46.280 --> 58:51.560
That's a good point, that is a really good point.

58:51.560 --> 58:59.560
And also I would also point out that there's the other way you could interpret this was

58:59.560 --> 59:04.520
fast and concise communication from the development team because you guys responded pretty quickly

59:04.520 --> 59:06.660
and were clear as to why it wasn't included.

59:06.660 --> 59:11.000
There's no mystery, it's not like it gets left as an unanswered thing.

59:11.000 --> 59:14.600
Alright yeah here it is, yeah I see.

59:14.600 --> 59:16.520
Yeah and I've only had a very very brief look at it.

59:16.520 --> 59:21.960
There was a reason why we have things to be maintained because while it might not have

59:21.960 --> 59:27.240
a security bug now, the nature of security bugs is they happen after the fact.

59:27.240 --> 59:28.800
That is just how they happen.

59:28.800 --> 59:33.400
It could be something in a dependency that's changed, you know one part of the API it uses

59:33.400 --> 59:35.200
now behaves differently.

59:35.200 --> 59:38.860
If nobody else is maintaining it then you're taking on a responsibility that in a year

59:38.860 --> 59:41.960
or two years from now you're going to have a CVE.

59:41.960 --> 59:43.520
So you have to think in those terms.

59:43.520 --> 59:48.800
The concept of, so the core concept and I think what he finds to be frustrating is,

59:48.800 --> 59:53.040
and this is where he says NOAA is right, is that software can be 100% finished.

59:53.040 --> 59:54.040
Feature complete.

59:54.040 --> 59:55.040
NOAA uses Thunderbird.

59:55.040 --> 59:56.040
Clearly it's wrong.

59:56.040 --> 59:58.560
I tend to agree too because software does not stand alone.

59:58.560 --> 01:00:05.760
It is surrounded by a collection of libraries and processes that are all potentially vulnerable

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:10.760
and the whole system, especially Linux, is constantly moving.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:15.040
And if your application stands still, eventually the platform underneath will just open up

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.440
a vulnerability that you're susceptible to, let alone just incompatibility of any other

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.440
kind.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.440
Right.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.440
Keeping up to date, compatible, yes.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.440
Right.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.860
And I mean there is another aspect to this as well.

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:30.880
Now we've had people before, you know like the general policy is if it doesn't meet

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.600
the policy to close it.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:36.000
If there is a problem with it, because it's a very generic policy, there might be some

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.720
things that could skip through that policy, right?

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.720
So if there is that case, then you raise it.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:47.120
You raise it through the appropriate channels, literally the IRC channels or you ping me.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.720
You know, you communicate with us.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.520
What you don't do is then go and act the bollocks and then throw a rant on Reddit just because

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.920
you didn't get your way.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:59.800
Now if I'm going to work with people in Solace, I value one single quality above all else

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:03.920
when it comes to working with other people and that is integrity.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.540
And it's clearly not demonstrated in this case.

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.200
So I don't need to take the patch.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:12.960
Now what we can do, if they wanted to talk about reviewing the process, then yes we can

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.960
do that.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.240
Unfortunately, we haven't had time to have that discussion.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:22.640
Now what we did to cover our own backsides basically said if it's not maintained anymore,

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.520
we just can't afford to take that on because that's just shooting ourselves in the foot

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.800
and asking for trouble down the road.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.760
Now what we can do to actually address this problem, now if he'd actually come to me

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.800
and said look, we kind of need this thing and there is no alternatives, what can we

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:36.800
do about it?

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.800
Is there any way we can loosen the policy?

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:43.280
I mean to be honest, it isn't – I mean so you can take argument with how he brought

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:49.640
up the issue but Vermeer's primary issue here is probably on a grander scale, something

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.820
you're going to face consistently.

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:53.760
Everybody has their esoteric thing that they want installed.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:56.200
I mean this is the thing.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.760
So you get people come along, right?

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.680
They've been with it for all of two seconds.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.640
They assume it needs to be exactly what they say it is.

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:07.300
They ignore what the project actually is and because it doesn't do exactly what they

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.300
have to do.

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.920
Like we've had it before, like oh, how dare you not have server software.

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.200
How do you think you're going to get anywhere in the market when you don't cater to servers?

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.000
It's for desktops you jackass.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Yeah.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.600
Although I did come as like wait a minute, SabNZB isn't available?

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.600
This is crazy.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.600
Oh right, it's for desktops.

01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:30.440
But in this particular case, we have a bit of software which is from what I can now understand

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.880
having looked at it afterwards, it is the only thing that does what this particular

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.640
guy needs to do, right?

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:42.080
So fine, we have a review processes and we say, all right, so our policy at the moment

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.080
is far too anal.

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.040
We know that and we're honest about that, right?

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:47.000
But what you do is you talked about this.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:53.920
Now, what my proposal would be to do there is we say, okay, if we can't use the age rule,

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:58.120
which obviously is a very loose rule, it doesn't always work, then what we can say, if it exists

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:03.580
in free of remain stream distributions, excluding Arch, I'm sorry, but if it exists in Ubuntu

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:09.160
and or Debian, Fedora and openSUSE, then we could just skip that rule because we're then

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:12.320
sharing the weight among all the distributions.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:16.360
That's something I would have been willing to discuss with this person, but then just

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:21.280
to go up on Reddit because you've used it for a day, you didn't get your own way and

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.960
then you go scream to the whole internet, I don't want to work with you now.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:28.560
We're looking for community maintainers, people to come on board, people who will engage in

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:33.480
a responsible way and demonstrate integrity, a relationship of trust, then we'll onboard

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.360
you and we'd love to work with you.

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:38.020
If you're going to go there and you're going to throw your toys out with a pram, I've no

01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:43.440
interest in working with you at all because you're wasting my time and just stressing

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.600
me out for absolutely no reason.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.480
I don't need to work with people like that.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:52.120
Now, while I love contributions coming to Solus, that would have taken me all of 14

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.540
seconds to package.

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:59.060
I don't need it, but it does help us because those 14 seconds, they all add up, right?

01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:02.300
So we can keep adding more and we add value for people, but if you're trying to change

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:06.260
what Solus is, I'm not going to allow you to do that by saying it's a niche when it's

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:11.080
your niche that's not being met.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.520
You need to understand when you're looking at something, you understand what it is.

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:17.500
I think that's a great point, is consider the audience.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:21.000
It's sort of the same problem that people have when they go use elementary OS.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.800
It's like a very technical user goes to use elementary OS that is expecting more like

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:28.520
a plasma experience than they get elementary OS, which is much simpler and they think,

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:33.080
this is a distribution for noobs and it's a boutique and it's no good and they denounce

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:35.720
it online and it's just you're not the right audience for it.

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:36.720
Right.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.720
It's kind of like an interview, right?

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:42.360
Like where it's a fit for both of you and we're not like by talking about Solus or not,

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.120
we're not trying to say Solus is the perfect thing for all of your things, right?

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.620
We're saying for this use case, the things that we're using it for, we found it to be

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.840
enjoyable and interesting and worthwhile to check out.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.840
Exactly.

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.840
If it doesn't fit, then it doesn't fit.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:58.520
What we want to do in Solus now is we are aware that we have problems in the processes

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:03.600
because they've existed since the beginning, you know, and Solus now is, you know, it's

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.680
establishing itself.

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:10.160
And as I say, we've got over 600 requests on it, 200 of those are package requests.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.740
So that's one third of the bugs we have are package requests.

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:17.120
So clearly there is a problem with package availability, right?

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.920
I'll hold my hands up to that.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:21.760
Solus doesn't have all the packages that everybody needs.

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.080
We want to address that.

01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:27.180
So we want to get people on board who can identify these things, but again, can look

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:31.280
at Solus for what it is and say, okay, does this thing really apply to Solus?

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.280
And you know, we can change the process.

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.940
So it's not just, well, this thing hasn't seen a release since 2013.

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:38.320
Is it in free or distro?

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.320
Yes.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.320
Can we distribute it?

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.320
Yes.

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.440
Is there 84 other things doing the same thing?

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.180
You know, so sensible rules.

01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:47.040
And then we can start to form a team.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.320
We'll give people get access.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:51.000
We'll give them publish access so they can get these things on.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.380
There is a right way to do things and a wrong way.

01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:58.240
The way that this reaction has gone on Reddit, they're just, it's the, it's the meme diff

01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.800
reaction that you get from people.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.660
So on this one, Solus has no packages.

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:03.000
They're just a meme distro.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000
They'll get nowhere.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.040
It's the same as when people rant about elementary OS, you know, they say they're only focused

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:12.980
on design, but what they forget about elementary OS is they actually do focus on software.

01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:17.800
You know, if you look behind the scenes, you've got things like, um, wifi portal support.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.040
They've got their own firewall D front end.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.200
They have that whole, they have that whole templating system.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.480
We get it set up to create, uh, apps on the desktop environment.

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.480
It's really well done.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.480
Right.

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:31.320
So people ignore the actual reality of it when it doesn't suit their needs.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.200
I mean, that's what it comes down to, isn't it?

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:34.200
Yeah.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.200
You know, you're angry with something.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.600
So you actually forget the reality of it.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.600
Yeah.

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.600
Yeah.

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.240
So I think you're saying Solus is only about design.

01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.040
Solus is only about design.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:45.760
And if it's not purple, I'm sorry, I'm not interested.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:49.720
Um, but yeah, I mean this, this thing on Reddit, I'm not annoyed at it.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:50.720
I'm not annoyed at him.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.720
Yeah.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:52.720
I'm kind of disappointed.

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.720
I'm more disappointed with it.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.720
Yeah.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.840
So when these kind of feedback pieces come in, you know, I reason I want to cover it

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:01.400
is Ramir is one case here, but really it's probably something that's been a lot, you

01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:06.080
know, you read the rest of the comments, uh, people had go as far as to say that I am damaging

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:11.120
Linux because we're a, we're a large channel that is actively guiding less informed people

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.880
to a niche within a niche.

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.520
And so we are going to cause Linux desktop usage to implode.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:17.520
Yeah.

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:22.080
Because we know the inverse to be true because what they're actually doing is stifling innovation

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:26.000
and freedom by forcing people onto the establishment.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.880
So this is where it does feel a little anti-change, a little, a little a pro establishment, a

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:34.920
little like why do something different is that there is an element of that.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:35.920
Yeah.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.560
I mean the, the, the words you always hear out of people's mouth is why are you reinventing

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.560
the wheel?

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.320
And it never has anything to do with the wheel.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.080
It's always the friction in the road.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:49.480
And unfortunately these people are part of that friction in the road.

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:53.200
Maybe Jupiter Broadcasting needs Linux plugged in so that you can only talk about Red Hat,

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.200
Ubuntu and SUSE.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.200
Yeah.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:59.160
What we'll do is we'll create an approved licensed Linux distributions that are, that

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:05.240
are mainstream and that are a new approved only approved PR representatives from those

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.000
enterprises here to talk.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.600
No more, no more Ikea.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.880
We all know how a monopolized industry with no competition.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.360
We all know how that goes.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.360
Right?

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:16.360
Yeah.

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.360
Right.

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.560
I hope I don't mean to be, I don't mean to be come across as crass, but I was sort of,

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:25.240
I was sort of shocked by the whole thread started three days ago because the, it just

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:29.560
seemed, it seemed a little over the top because really I don't think we ever say drop what

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:30.560
you're doing.

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.760
And in fact, I mean on this network you've had shows like what's the best beginner distro.

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.400
What's the best distro to introduce to your friends.

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:37.400
Right.

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.400
So yeah.

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:39.400
Really have a different take on this.

01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:40.400
Okay.

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.400
Go ahead.

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:45.480
Yeah, I mean, I think with, with the first premise, which it can software be complete

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:49.280
and people saying that now as a developer, when you're developing something, you have

01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:51.640
to set yourself a barrier boundary.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:54.360
Otherwise you will end your life and you're not going to finish it.

01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:57.280
So there is such feature complete.

01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.280
I agree.

01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:59.280
Yeah.

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.280
Feature complete.

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:01.280
Yep.

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:04.660
And, and of course if the ecosystem around is changing, but it's intended to support

01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:09.560
applications on its top and now open the vulnerability, maybe the fault is that that system on the

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.000
way that it changed.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.120
Maybe the system recognized that it's no longer important or crucial to maintain that up functioning

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:21.240
of that application, which indeed needs to be considered by those that orchestrate the

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.240
system.

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:25.880
So in this case, it's on the responsibility of the maintainers of the distribution to

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:28.960
decide they'd like to take that risk or not.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:32.840
I would say too, like in the case of mini-com, it has, it has very small set of dependencies

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.240
like bash is really one of its major dependencies.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.240
But sure.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:41.480
They'll get into specifics of specific software cause that then it can be very different for

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.840
each independent case.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:45.720
It needs to be evaluated by the core principles.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:49.460
Now it goes to the second factor that I like to point out, which is how people tend to

01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:50.960
choose distributions.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:56.480
I've stressed this in this show multiple times and I still think people don't get it.

01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:59.960
It's like stop choosing your distribution by the features or applications that come

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:04.860
from installing on it and change and choose it based on principle.

01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:09.800
It's something that it says that I'm going to care for advanced users and I'm going to

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:14.200
make my primary choices and target for that type of niche, then you're probably going

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:16.800
to be better served there, so on and so forth.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.800
So that's actually-

01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:18.800
That's so boring.

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:19.800
That's so boring.

01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:20.800
How do I distro hub?

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:21.800
No, yeah.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:22.800
I think it's actually a good point.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:23.800
I have to disagree with part of that.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.240
Okay, go ahead.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.960
Once you've completed an application, right?

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:30.960
So if I'm writing any software, you do have a roadmap, you know, you do have this architectural

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.040
overview of what you're going to do, right?

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:38.320
And yes, there is a point where you are, as you say, you are feature complete, but as

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:43.200
a responsible developer, you still maintain it.

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:46.200
It enters its twilight years.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.200
Right.

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:50.320
Well, the fact is if you're going to have something around, you know, like that's not

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.720
going to be maintained anymore, why would you take the risk in the first place?

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:58.120
That's why I said if there's free over distributions that did have that, then sure, because then

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.840
we're all sharing the burden, right?

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:05.640
But if you've got to set a precedent somewhere, we can't just say, well, this thing, you know,

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.640
we'll let this one in.

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:12.080
But the other stuff of the exact same criteria, which also isn't maintained, isn't going in,

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:16.640
you know, you can't do that.

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.960
It's just bad form to take on abandoned software, full stop.

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:24.880
It doesn't seem long term supportable, especially if you do have a smaller team, like you don't

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.480
And we are a rolling release as well.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:29.680
It's not like we're a static release, the chances of those things breaking and falling

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:34.800
apart is exponentially more dangerous than the static release because you can drop them

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:35.960
between the releases.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.160
However, we've got to keep these things going on.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.960
So then we adopt technical debt.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.440
We've got to add that thing to our QA now.

01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:46.920
We've got to make sure this thing is working and we've got to keep this working over time.

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:50.720
It's much harder to get rid of something from a rolling system than it is an over.

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:53.880
And then you get to the point where you've gone from having, say, 5000 packages or so

01:11:53.880 --> 01:12:00.680
like we have now, not 10, you know, to the point where you've then got 15, 20, 30,000

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.280
packages and 40% of them are abandoned.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:12.560
And I wonder, too, if it was a popular open source project, maybe we could fantasize about

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:19.000
a situation where somebody takes it on, fixes some of the bugs, maybe starts repackaging

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.400
it and it gets brought back to life.

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:24.880
Maybe you would hope that would happen, but I kind of have to fall down with Ikea on this.

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:30.160
You could package it up and make it work for a while, but you pick up half a dozen of these

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:32.640
and all of a sudden you've got yourself a nice string of technical debt that you have

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:33.640
to...

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.920
Especially if you're trying to have a standard for packages, you want your packages to work,

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.600
you try to have QA and release cycles and continuous integration cycles where things

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:42.400
build and if these things are suddenly going to start failing and you're going to have

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.400
to investigate it.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:49.280
I agree that that's real work to take on and given your project doesn't make sense really.

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.280
There is a solution.

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:55.000
If you have little bits of software that they do love, all she would have to do is look

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.520
at it one or two months, take over that project, offer to take it over, every one, two, maybe

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:04.200
three months even, just have a look at it, make sure everything builds all right and

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.360
then just bump a new tag.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:11.600
We need like an incubator where these projects can go, like one, like a real incubator.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.080
It's not run by Google or something.

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.640
All packages go to heaven.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.640
Yeah.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:19.240
Or maybe it's more like Purgatory, I'm not sure, but...

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:24.520
Then we can at least, our favorite things can get updated.

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:30.640
In the meantime, I mean, I guess you could always set up a Docker container, put a Ubuntu

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.480
environment in there and load Minicom in there, maybe.

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.480
I don't know.

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:35.480
That's impossible.

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:40.160
No, I'll put Minicom in because it's the only one that does the thing and because at least

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:44.760
free over distribution to have it and I'll make that a rule going forward and we could

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:49.360
have saved ourselves all of this heartache, all of this pain by not going on and doing

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:54.600
a big thing up on Reddit, just so everyone else sees how unhappy you are, it was no help

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:55.600
to us.

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.600
Yeah.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:59.600
It was absolutely no help to Solace at all because I've had to take time out of my, obviously

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:04.040
I love coming on and seeing you guys, I'll make that one very clear now, because I've

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.040
had to come on.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.040
Well, don't fucking come on then.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.040
Oops, sorry.

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:13.040
But yeah, I've had to take time out of my schedule now to come and deal with a non-issue.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:19.920
Yeah, I think when people ask why Solace and I say the leadership, I think this conversation

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:23.040
sort of underscores why I say that.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:28.000
So I think, hopefully, if you've been wondering why do they talk about Solace so much, maybe

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.440
that sort of sheds a little light on it.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:32.520
And if not, maybe we'll get to hear more from you.

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.520
Yeah.

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.200
Anyway, thank you for coming on and setting us straight and it sounds like Mr. Vlamer

01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:43.320
there, Vermeer, could look forward to freaking MiniCom and Solace in the future.

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:44.320
Yeah.

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.320
There you go.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:46.320
Yay.

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.320
Yeah.

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.320
Yeah, everybody wins-ish.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.920
All right, well that right there brings us to the end of this week's Linux Unplugged.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.920
We're going to skedaddle so that way we can get out of here for the TechSnap guys, which

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.560
are coming up in just a little bit.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:02.840
If you'd like to join us live and get even more show, go over to jblive.tv on a Tuesday.

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:09.060
Get it converted to your local time zone at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:13.160
Go check out iKey if you want more iKey on late night Linux over there.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:14.160
And check out Wes.

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:15.160
What's your Twitter handle, Wes?

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:16.160
Where are people going to follow you?

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:17.160
At Wes Payne.

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.160
Magic.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.740
I'm at Chris LAS.

01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:23.840
You could give us your feedback or news ideas at linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:24.840
Thanks for being here.

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:52.240
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:15:54.840 --> 01:16:17.680
All right, everybody.

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:20.100
Thank you very much for being here.

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:22.440
Everybody now, everybody now go to jbtitles.com.

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:26.240
Just pick our title and let's get the studio ready for Wes.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:29.400
Alexa, turn on JB1.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.280
So now we'll get the lights warmed up for you.

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:37.680
Oh, boy, that's quite a different environment in here.

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.680
All right.

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:39.680
Boy, sheesh.

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:41.160
I didn't realize we were doing lup in a cave.

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.160
I know.

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.160
But I like that.

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.160
I mean, it was a wonderful cave.

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.160
It was.

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.160
It was very warm.

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.160
There was beer there.

01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:48.160
Now I feel like we're on.

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.160
Now we've got to be on.

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:50.160
Hello, everybody.

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.160
All right.

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.160
Let's see here.

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:55.760
Lup Enhanced is for jackasses, you desktop.

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.600
It's for desktops, you jackass.

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.320
What about instead of jackass, we did you jerk or something like that?

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:01.320
Yeah.

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.320
Something more palatable.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:04.000
Still going to piss somebody off.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000
Yeah.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.040
Lup Enhanced is also pretty good.

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.040
Oh, come on.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:14.920
While you guys vote, let's see if, Wes, you knew the five secret unity features that most

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:16.920
people don't know.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:17.920
Number one.

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.400
No, let's do it in reverse order.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.400
You ready to do it in reverse order?

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.400
Yeah, let's do it.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:22.400
Number two.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:23.400
Number five.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.400
Number five.

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:28.000
You can reveal all of the different key bindings for the Unity desktop by holding down their

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000
meta key.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Well, we all knew that.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Yeah, that one.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.920
I mean, I feel like that one, you just take a little too long doing anything, and you're

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:34.920
like, oh, what if I stumble?

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:35.920
All right.

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:36.920
Number four.

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:40.960
Using the super key to open the trash super plus T.

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.120
I did not know that.

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:43.120
I didn't.

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:44.120
Let me try this on Gnome.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.120
Oh, that's nothing.

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.120
Nothing.

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.120
Okay, I didn't know that.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.800
You know how you could know that?

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:50.960
From the quick list that it pops up with the super key.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:51.960
You don't even.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.080
You're about to ruin.

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.080
Number three.

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.960
Using the super key to launch specific lenses.

01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.520
Yeah, lenses are a thing.

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.180
Super A is the app lens.

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:01.740
Super F is the files lens.

01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:02.740
Super M is music.

01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:05.520
C is photos, and V is videos.

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:10.520
And then number two, which rotten totally just spoiled.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:13.200
You can figure out, oh, wait, no, it was this?

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:14.920
Oh, yeah, because it would show you trash.

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:15.920
That was the first one you pointed out.

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:16.920
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:19.760
You can launch a program on the launcher, but with the super key.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:24.520
So super key, and then one through the series of one through nine, and the different icon

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:25.520
positions.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:29.160
So like number one is files, and this two is Firefox, and you did super key two to launch

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:30.280
Firefox.

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:31.280
That's actually legit.

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.280
Yeah.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:33.280
That's not bad.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.280
I'd like that.

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:35.280
I'd like that.

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.760
So if I'm on plasma for a week, maybe you should install Unity on there.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:37.760
Don't even.

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:41.520
And then HUD, which is number one, which everybody knows about.

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:45.200
Pressing the Alt key while using any program, Unity reveals a type your command window,

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:46.760
which is actually kind of a neat feature.

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:47.760
Yeah.

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.960
Where did our title shake out while we did that?

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:52.320
All right, guys, we're checking in on your work.

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.320
Yay, the titles.

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.320
Oh, really?

01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.320
What is it?

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:56.320
This is the quiz we mentioned.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.320
Popey says he has one.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.320
We don't know.

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:01.080
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:02.080
What is it?

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.840
Come on, Popey.

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:13.720
What is it?

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:15.880
Shift print screen.

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:21.080
That takes a screenshot of your window, specifically.

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:22.080
All right.

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.080
All right.

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.080
There you go.

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.080
Shift print screen, everybody.

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.080
There you go.

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.080
Nice, Popey.

01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.080
Nice.

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:29.080
Crypton infusion.

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:30.080
Controls print screen is the window.

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.080
That's a region.

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:32.080
Yeah.

01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:33.080
How about it's for desktops, jerks?

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:34.880
No, see, but then that guy's going to think we're calling him a jerk in the title.

01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:35.880
Right.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:36.880
When it wasn't actually aimed at him.

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:37.880
Yeah.

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:38.880
It was a previous book.

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:39.880
Yeah.

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:40.880
Yeah.

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:41.880
So that's the only thing about that.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.880
That's the only thing about that.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:47.880
Oh, so I have to say one thing to keep Popey happy otherwise he's not going to let it go.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:52.880
So it's an operating system, not a distro.

01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:53.880
There you go.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:55.560
Oh, is this a thing of yours?

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:56.560
You don't call it a distro?

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.560
Is that a...

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:03.240
So my ambition is to build an operating system, not just another distro.

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:06.000
Not just a distro, but the whole operating system.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.600
So apparently I have to say potatoes.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:08.600
Oh, you...

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:09.600
God damn it.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.600
No.

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:13.600
I just realized what you've done to me.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.320
I love it.

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.720
This is why you probably tuned in.

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:18.720
That's amazing.

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:20.720
This is literally why Popey tuned in probably.

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:21.720
Oh.

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:24.680
Or as we say here, spuds.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.680
Spuds.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.680
Spuds.

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:29.680
With a H.

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:31.160
Happy football day everybody, by the way.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.160
It was football here in the United States.

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:34.160
Football.

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:35.160
Sports.

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.160
Yeah, sports ball.

01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:37.160
Sports ball.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.160
All right.

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:40.120
So I don't know if we should go with it's for desktops, jerk, because it's for...

01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:42.040
I know.

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:43.640
My Linux is not your Linux.

01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:46.120
It's a little abrasive, so we can't do that.

01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:48.840
Enthusiastically enhanced.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.800
Quantum of Solace played again.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.280
Solace is your grandpa's Linux.

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:56.040
We're going to have to switch over for a tech snap here in a moment.

01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:57.360
It won't be that rough.

01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.400
We won't have to restart the stream or anything.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:02.240
There may be a standby screen for a moment or two, but...

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:03.240
Just do what it says.

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.240
Standby.

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.240
That's right.

01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.240
That's all you got to do is just standby.

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:07.240
It's really easy.

01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.240
You can even sit by if you'd like.

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:11.880
Standby, Wes.

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:12.880
Linux nose-plugged.

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:16.680
Ah, I get it.

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:19.040
Windows 10 anniversary surprise.

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.040
That's true.

01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.040
That's good, too.

01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:22.040
It's just so long.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:26.120
I just realized I forgot to comment on the fact that you said that Gedi seemed more responsive

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:29.160
and I was like, oh, that's a myth.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.160
What's that?

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.160
Oh, yeah.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.160
Boutique.

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.480
Oh, that was my idea of a boutique distro myth.

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:34.480
Was something like that.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:35.480
Something like that was my title.

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:37.120
It was what I was thinking in the back of my head, but I forgot to suggest it.

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.120
Boutique.

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:41.600
You know the funny part there when he was asking about what a buntumate's thing is called?

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:42.600
It's the software boutique.

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:43.600
Yeah.

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:44.600
I thought so.

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:45.600
Yes.

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:46.600
That's right.

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:47.600
I thought so, but then we were saying boutique so much.

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:48.600
But that's just the software part.

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:49.600
Yeah.

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:50.600
I know.

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:53.080
But we were saying it so much that I was like, shit, am I now mixing up my words or

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.080
what?

01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.080
Boutique.

01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.080
The damn word.

01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:58.560
So boutique distro myth.

01:21:58.560 --> 01:21:59.560
The myth.

01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:02.480
How about the myth of boutique distros or something like that?

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:03.480
Is that good?

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:04.480
It's not bad.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:05.480
Not bad.

01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:08.320
I feel like myths played out a lot, but that's fine.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.320
Yeah.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:12.000
That's the server distro myth.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.320
Busting the boutique mistrodith or something like that.

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.320
I don't know.

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:20.920
What do you... The WWE has submitted a boutique distro myth, but I feel like that's not quite

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:24.840
... It feels a little clunky, although I like that it's only three words.

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:25.840
And there are boutique distros.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:26.840
Yeah.

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:27.840
Yeah, there are.

01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:28.840
It's true.

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:29.840
Damn it, Ike.

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:37.120
I feel like people don't take a pause to think about what they post before they post it.

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:38.400
Well, they get upset, you know?

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:42.480
Well, in that case, that dude had this huge rant, so he had to take a little bit of time

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.480
to reread some stuff.

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:44.480
Well, I mean, maybe he didn't read it.

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:45.480
Maybe he just wrote it.

01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:46.480
The boutique battle.

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:55.680
I wish it would play better orally, but the contender is kind of funny, just with the

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:56.680
K.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:57.680
Yeah.

01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:04.640
It's not a title, but I do like that play on words.

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.800
We could have had some communication puns as well.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.280
We missed out there.

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.280
Some communication puns?

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:10.280
What do you mean?

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:11.280
Yeah.

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:12.280
We really lost out there, didn't we?

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:13.280
With a K or something?

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:15.080
No, because the radio stuff.

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.080
Oh.

01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.080
Yeah.

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:39.200
We really missed an opportunity there.
