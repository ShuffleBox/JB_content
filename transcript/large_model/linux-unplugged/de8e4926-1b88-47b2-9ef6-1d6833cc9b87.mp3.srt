1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,960
We are in an alternate location today.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,800
We are in a backup location.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,160
Super secret.

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,160
Location A was right outside

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,640
where they have this secret room that we can go into,

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,520
but we're not allowed to tell you what is said in there

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,840
and we're not allowed to record anything.

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,680
Oh.

9
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,320
But outside that room, we set up camp

10
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,240
where they have these tables

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,520
and that's where we did Coda Radio Live yesterday.

12
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,360
Right. Yeah.

13
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,160
So we were at the Hilton in downtown Seattle

14
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,160
at the Sprint event.

15
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,280
And the problem was, is next to the Sprint event,

16
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,360
the room over, so the doors are side by side,

17
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,680
they're two different ballrooms,

18
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,160
and the door over was a practical marketing strategy,

19
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,040
training session.

20
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,880
Oh boy.

21
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,960
And so all of these people

22
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,720
who have been sent to practical marketing training

23
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,440
by their companies were coming out

24
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,060
and seeing these two guys in apparently servant clothing,

25
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,480
asking us questions like,

26
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,160
what's the bathroom code?

27
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,440
Where do I get food?

28
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,040
My favorite one is a lady interrupted Coda Radio

29
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,560
to ask me if they have non-dairy creamer.

30
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,040
Like you're sitting here doing the live show.

31
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,080
I have this headset on.

32
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,900
Oh my God.

33
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,740
Which is the headset

34
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,880
like the ESPN broadcasters are wearing, right?

35
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,720
We're coming into,

36
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,680
we have both Noah and I are sitting there talking.

37
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,240
We're loud because we're on the air.

38
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,260
We're looking at our laptops.

39
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,560
We have a mixer there.

40
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
There's wires everywhere.

41
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,160
So clearly you're there to take live questions

42
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,000
about the hotel.

43
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,360
Non-dairy creamer.

44
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,440
So today we're like, boy,

45
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,320
we should really find an alternate location.

46
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,680
We should really, cause that didn't work well

47
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,400
cause we got interrupted a couple of times.

48
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,480
And we arrive at outside the secret room again

49
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,480
to discover a bit of, I would say, hushed chaos.

50
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,600
Like the room was tense.

51
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,800
And we're like, what's going on?

52
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,120
Why is the room so tense?

53
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,480
Did somebody fart?

54
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,760
And so we're walking around

55
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,280
and I'm trying to get on the wifi

56
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,240
and I'm getting frustrated.

57
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,000
And I give my laptop to Noah.

58
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,380
I say, Brown bear, will you get me on the wifi?

59
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,220
I got it.

60
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,040
He's got the special touch.

61
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,880
Yeah, I got a touch base with JV1.

62
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,000
And as I'm walking around,

63
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,920
Wimpy comes around the corner and says,

64
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,640
oh, the wifi is down.

65
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,480
What's that?

66
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,300
Oh no.

67
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,280
The network's down here at the switch.

68
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,440
The switch lost its config.

69
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,720
And the APs that are wired into the switch

70
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,560
are essentially without any network connectivity right now.

71
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,000
You get a little tipsy with the switch.

72
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,440
You misplace it and you leave it behind at the bar.

73
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,320
And it was this weird experience.

74
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,680
So right before that,

75
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,700
I don't know if you were there for this happen,

76
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,160
but I was just walking away.

77
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,000
So it was in the, yeah.

78
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,040
I was just walking.

79
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,760
I was just going into the restroom

80
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,640
or coming out of the restroom.

81
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,320
And this guy, this weird old guy,

82
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,560
and you all know what I'm talking about, right?

83
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,800
Like he has his phone in his hand.

84
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,080
What you're gonna look like in about 45 years.

85
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,560
Yeah, but this guy, it's like,

86
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,720
you're not quite sure if he knows

87
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,920
that the screen is on or off,

88
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,240
and he's not quite sure what those icons are.

89
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,960
And he's mumbling about, I can't get connected.

90
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,080
Are you on the wifi?

91
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,320
That's when he comes up to Noah.

92
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,160
As I'm walking away here, hey, are you on the wifi?

93
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,000
The wifi.

94
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,480
So I said, no.

95
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,280
And then I was afraid he was gonna want me

96
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,240
to help him with his phone,

97
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,440
and maybe he wanted to be my friend

98
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,560
or something else terrible like that.

99
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,880
I do not have time for this.

100
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,880
And so I was looking at him.

101
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,720
I just kind of brushed it off.

102
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,000
And then he mutters.

103
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,320
He goes, oh, we lost the switch configuration,

104
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,520
and I, ah, so the whole wifi's down.

105
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,520
And I was like, dude, wifi does not come from switches.

106
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,120
Wifi comes from access points.

107
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,680
And this further confirms that you are some old guy

108
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,600
that doesn't know how to use this technology.

109
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,200
Obviously, the wifi works just fine.

110
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,960
I'm not connected.

111
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,000
And then Wimpy comes out and says, oh, the wifi's down.

112
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,920
And then it dawns on me,

113
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,160
that dude is actually the tech from the hotel.

114
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,080
He's here to fix it, and he was probably right.

115
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,720
It probably was a lost configuration.

116
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,880
So the hotel went into problem-solving mode

117
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,160
because they got a big client here, Canonical,

118
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,600
who is doing, has people, has industry

119
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,040
from all over Washington and local areas here,

120
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,200
working on things that are all connected to the internet.

121
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,120
And this is a big part of why they're here.

122
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,600
And so the hotel has a problem to solve.

123
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,560
And I see these,

124
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,640
I see all these different discussions going on.

125
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,760
I got a little audio, but I might tell the story again,

126
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,440
and Linux one plugged a little bit with the audio.

127
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,200
But they decide we gotta move hotel rooms.

128
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,400
Long story short, we decide we gotta move hotel rooms.

129
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,820
Yeah, and so we're now in the backup location.

130
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,080
That's a big backup last-minute change.

131
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,320
But now here we have wired, we have wired ethernet.

132
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,660
We've got like, we've got 300 up, 300 down.

133
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,640
So we're sending uncompressed PCM audio

134
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,480
for this live event from downtown Seattle.

135
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,320
That's amazing.

136
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,880
Live from downtown Seattle,

137
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,880
this is Linux Unplugged episode 234 for January 30th, 2018.

138
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:19,800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged,

139
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,160
Jupyter Broadcasting's weekly Linux talk show

140
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,800
that is live from a Canonical Snap event

141
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,440
in a fancy hotel ballroom.

142
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,400
My name is Chris.

143
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,240
My name is Wes.

144
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,400
Hello, Wes.

145
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,240
Hello, sir.

146
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,080
Nice to see you downtown.

147
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,280
So I came to you this week.

148
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,120
You sure did.

149
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,960
Well, you're so nice.

150
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,240
Well, you know, that's the least I could do

151
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,600
when Canonical's in town.

152
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,840
Yeah, we're gonna give you a peek

153
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,640
at what it takes to actually make a Snap package.

154
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,200
Get a company on board with Snaps.

155
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,760
We're at a SnapCraft summit right now.

156
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,520
But we also have some breaking news

157
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,280
12 minutes before the show went on the air.

158
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,160
We'll talk about, we have big other community news

159
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,200
we will discuss as well as a very frank discussion

160
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,600
about Gnome, something I'm trying for a little bit.

161
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,680
And we'll end it with my favorite terminal emulator

162
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,520
of all time.

163
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,360
Whoa.

164
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,200
Yeah, yeah.

165
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,640
Those are strong words, Chris.

166
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,480
I know, I know.

167
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,800
And Wes, if that's not enough, Noah's here too.

168
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,960
Hello, brown bear.

169
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,080
Hey, thanks for having me.

170
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,560
Yeah, hey, thank you for running the board

171
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,400
during the show.

172
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,220
Yeah, no problem.

173
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,060
I've actually, I've gotten two,

174
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,020
we'll see if we, we'll see if I do a good job,

175
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,080
but I got the bottom two of your show now.

176
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,920
That's true, yeah, yeah.

177
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,000
You are a machine.

178
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,200
Yeah, you know what you ought to do?

179
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,880
I don't know, man, we should pull someone in for Ask Noah

180
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,520
because Ask Noah's coming up right after the show.

181
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,720
We're doing that live from here too.

182
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,560
Oh, yeah?

183
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,880
One of us ought to crash his show.

184
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,720
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

185
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,540
Make it fair.

186
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,320
Yeah, all right, well, let's also have the Mumble Room

187
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,960
crash our show because every single episode

188
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,280
of the Unplugged program is joined by our virtual lug,

189
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,240
even when we're alive on this occasion in downtown Seattle.

190
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,160
Hello, Mumble Room, time appropriate greetings.

191
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,840
Well, hey, how's it going?

192
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,680
Hello.

193
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,240
Hello, hello, you know, the old saying,

194
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,640
a watched Mumble Room doesn't boil.

195
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,360
I have no eyes on the Mumble Room today,

196
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,680
but I am told that we have great.

197
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,640
They're stronger than ever.

198
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,960
Yeah, we have a great turnout today.

199
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,880
It just takes us being live at a canonical event.

200
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,360
So what is this thing that we're at?

201
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,840
These sprints is kind of a rough definition.

202
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,400
Well, canonical describes it as something

203
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,280
similar to old-style bar camps.

204
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,520
And it's an agenda that's totally free-form.

205
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,200
The attendees drive the agenda.

206
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,120
And that kind of sounds like, oh, it must be free-floating.

207
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,400
But holy hell if these guys don't hustle their asses off

208
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,680
from actually 8 AM.

209
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,960
Technically, it starts at 9 AM, but they technically

210
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,040
start at AM, really, because they

211
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,360
have a company breakfast where everybody starts networking

212
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,880
and setting up expectations for the day at 8 AM.

213
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,720
They start on the schedule at 9 AM,

214
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,560
and they don't finish until 6 PM.

215
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,640
And it is go, go, go, go, go the entire time.

216
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,640
So they work with a bunch of different companies

217
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,360
that have come in, in what they say from companies

218
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,680
from different domains, from GUI to electron-based

219
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,320
applications and all kinds of things in between,

220
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,760
robotics included.

221
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,520
They all bring these different companies

222
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,960
in to work on a common set of frameworks and SNAP packages

223
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,000
and so we are here to observe that.

224
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,080
And this event is pretty different than the New York

225
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,240
event.

226
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,360
It is much, much more of a nose to the grindstone,

227
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,520
work really hard, which I thought New York was,

228
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,760
because it's not like they were screwing around in New York.

229
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,440
But this is at a whole other level,

230
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,520
because there's some big names here,

231
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,640
which we'll talk about more in a little bit

232
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,340
that we've chatted with.

233
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,640
And so I think the pressure is really on to produce something.

234
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,880
And there's areas here that are off limits to us,

235
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,080
but they're still very accommodating.

236
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,680
Right now, we're not in an area where

237
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,880
there's any canonical folks around us,

238
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,880
because everything they're talking about,

239
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,320
they're being very careful because of the partners

240
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,760
involved, not because they really have a preference,

241
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,240
but their partners have a preference.

242
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,920
Strategic partnerships, you have to do it the right way.

243
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,240
Speaking of strategic partnerships,

244
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,760
this will be impacting you and I on TechSnap in the near future.

245
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,840
Just before we went on air, now it's like 15, 16 minutes ago,

246
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,360
Jim Whitehurst, CEO of Red Hat, just

247
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,440
tweeted and announced that Red Hat has acquired CoreOS

248
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,040
as part of their Kubernetes strategy.

249
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,800
Is that right?

250
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,120
Yeah.

251
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,880
Wow.

252
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,720
Yeah.

253
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,480
Isn't that huge?

254
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,320
That is huge news.

255
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,000
Yeah.

256
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,120
So Red Hat is going to be acquiring CoreOS, expanding,

257
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,160
this is the tweet, expanding their hashtag Kubernetes

258
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,080
and hashtag containers leadership.

259
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,320
That's not even really an overstatement there.

260
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,200
Like, CoreOS is defining some of the core fundamentals

261
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,400
about containerization.

262
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,080
And they, I think, have sort of prevented

263
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,520
the total Docker takeover of containerization

264
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
to some degree.

265
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,000
Yeah, I think it's also been really interesting,

266
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,440
and it makes sense that Red Hat would be also interested,

267
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,600
is that they've really been approaching it

268
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,360
from the platform.

269
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,860
You know, Ubuntu has their own Kubernetes sort of spin

270
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,520
and set up, but there's a lot of people that just,

271
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,860
they're rolling it themselves on whatever infrastructure.

272
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,240
CoreOS provided a whole stack.

273
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,600
You had a lot of tooling built in and a whole environment

274
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,240
designed with that first.

275
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,560
What about the, doesn't some of the cloud first initiative,

276
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,120
what is that we talked about last week in TechSnap?

277
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,040
Oh, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

278
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,040
Yeah, that's part of the subpart of the Linux Foundation.

279
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,120
Isn't there some technology in that group that's from CoreOS?

280
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,600
Yeah, the Rocket Runtime.

281
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,880
Right, and now Red Hat owns that.

282
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,680
They sure do.

283
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,600
And so one of the core container technologies

284
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,800
that the Linux Foundation is putting their weight behind

285
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,240
is something that Red Hat owns.

286
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,720
Yeah, it really gets them a piece of the market.

287
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,360
Yeah, that sure does.

288
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,440
And that just happened, I mean, the ramifications of that

289
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,160
are going to be really big.

290
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,720
We just did, to sort of perfect timing,

291
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,800
go to TechSnap.Systems, and we just did an introduction

292
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,680
to Kubernetes.

293
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,840
Episode 353.

294
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,440
Thank you.

295
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,240
Yeah, episode 353, TechSnap.Systems slash 353,

296
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,720
Too Many Containers.

297
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,380
And it's an introduction to why are people even

298
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,720
talking about Kubernetes, where did it come from,

299
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,760
what is its open source heritage,

300
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,240
and why is it getting so much credence and credibility

301
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,560
right now in the marketplace?

302
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,280
Why has it come from like zero to 100 miles per hour

303
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,800
in the last year and a half?

304
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,960
What is all that about, and what does it accomplish?

305
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
That's explained in 353.

306
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,280
And then if you listen to that, and then you

307
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,600
hear this Red Hat news, it really

308
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,040
puts it all in context.

309
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,760
That's really good timing on that episode.

310
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,480
I'm just saying.

311
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,000
It sure is.

312
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,920
I was kind of really glad we did that.

313
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,320
I'm sure there's going to be a ton more as this develops.

314
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,000
We'll actually see what changes.

315
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,800
Yeah, man, I don't know, Noah.

316
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,600
I know that you work a big part in virtualization.

317
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,040
That's a huge part of what you do.

318
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,240
Much with containers, are they at the alta speed?

319
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,240
No, not really.

320
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,160
And part of that is a lot of our businesses,

321
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,700
we do subcontracting for some very large businesses

322
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,440
like Walmart and Sport Clips and stuff like that.

323
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,920
But the primary focus of our business

324
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,320
is all in a lot of really small businesses, right?

325
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,200
And so for there, if there is containerization,

326
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
we're the ones that are doing the containering.

327
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,360
But for the most part, we're just virtualizing that stuff.

328
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,940
It's nice to have tools to manage all that when

329
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,920
you've got a lot of them.

330
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,520
When you get a chance, check your Discord chat.

331
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,400
Got to scroll down to the bottom.

332
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,800
Put like a thumbs up in there for me or something, you know?

333
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,740
So Noah has, not only is he providing the connectivity,

334
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,560
because he's, well, I guess technically the hotel's

335
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,680
providing the connectivity.

336
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,120
But the gear he brought, he has whittled this thing down

337
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,840
to this incredible tiny package that he can throw in a bag.

338
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,720
Yeah, you guys can't see it, but from our perspective,

339
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,560
it's like a mostly empty table with a couple laptops

340
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,400
and a magic machine making this whole thing possible.

341
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,640
And by the way, the laptops are, right now,

342
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm simple-helped into a client's computer.

343
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,840
So I'm not, the laptop has nothing to do with

344
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,680
the actual show.

345
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,500
Yeah, exactly.

346
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,080
The laptops are just for our web browsers and our chats.

347
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,640
Like there's nothing, the reason why I bring this up

348
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,040
is years past when we've done live events

349
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,060
for the last Linux Action Show or this show,

350
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,160
like there's literally been events where we're building

351
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,720
entire PCs hours before we go on air.

352
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,000
And it's like this complicated, thick, multi-computer,

353
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,940
three-laptop, huge sound mixer operation.

354
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,600
You wouldn't even need two people to carry this setup.

355
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,800
It's really remarkable.

356
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,160
And it's all because this guy's been playing around

357
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,120
with the actual radio.

358
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,720
Turns out, he becomes a radio professional.

359
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,360
All of a sudden, he gets the inside secrets,

360
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,200
stuff they don't tell the podcast.

361
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,560
I guess they already figured that out.

362
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,880
Who would have thought?

363
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,660
I guess it's something they've had to solve before.

364
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,400
Speaking of something you have to solve,

365
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,360
the cellular companies in this country have gone crazy.

366
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,520
Solve that high bill, switch to Ting.

367
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,720
Go to linux.ting.com, it's a smarter way to do mobile.

368
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,480
Your average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

369
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,120
It's pay for what you use.

370
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,920
A fair price for however much you talk,

371
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,620
however much you text, and however much data you use.

372
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,780
More on that in a moment.

373
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,480
They have nationwide coverage, no contracts,

374
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,780
it's $6 for your line, and then it's pay for what you use.

375
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,760
Well, when it's $6 for the line,

376
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,180
that enables cellular connectivity at a level

377
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,040
that you don't normally think about

378
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,800
how you can integrate cellular connectivity.

379
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,360
And I'll give you an example.

380
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,380
If you go to linux.ting.com, check out their store page.

381
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,180
It's like shop, but first go to linux.ting.com.

382
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,020
Support the show, right?

383
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,860
You gotta go there.

384
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,060
$9 SIM card.

385
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,900
Sure enough, this maniac across the table from us,

386
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,700
Noah's got a couple of these Ting SIM cards in his bag.

387
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,720
Yeah, he's got them right on his belt, right?

388
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,560
He just whips them out, ready to go.

389
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,760
It's funny you say that, actually.

390
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,440
He has them in his credit card holder.

391
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,500
So he's got a wallet credit card holder

392
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,280
with one credit card and multiple Ting SIM cards.

393
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,640
It really is how he does it.

394
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,040
And so a canonical employee comes out,

395
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,960
and he's from London,

396
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,520
and he doesn't have any cellular service.

397
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,260
He's got one of these cell phones

398
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,400
that he brought a cell phone with him,

399
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,600
but he doesn't have a SIM card.

400
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,800
And it was just a meet and greet

401
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,680
the night before the whole event kicked off.

402
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,160
And we're just sitting around drinking some Mac and Jacks,

403
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,020
and he mentions, you know,

404
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,540
I kind of wish they had Wi-Fi down here

405
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,520
because this phone's dead without Wi-Fi

406
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,920
because I don't have a SIM card in there.

407
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,600
And Noah says, well, would you like one?

408
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,340
And the guy looks at him like maybe Noah's

409
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,600
like a salesman or something.

410
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,880
And he's like, what are you offering?

411
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,200
He's like, no, really, I just carry these around.

412
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,040
And you know what?

413
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,860
You don't even have to put it on.

414
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,700
I'll just activate it.

415
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,540
It's six bucks.

416
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,380
What do I care?

417
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,200
I'll just turn it off after the weekend.

418
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,040
And he just gives,

419
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,560
so sure enough, he gives the guy the SIM card,

420
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,840
activates it on the spot, gets it all going.

421
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,640
The guy comes back, pops it in.

422
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,440
The only thing that slowed us down,

423
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,480
the only hitch is that he didn't have

424
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,800
one of those SIM remover pins.

425
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,860
You mean those tiny little pins, yeah.

426
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,760
But actually we realized we were at a hotel.

427
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,200
You just go to the front desk, they'll probably have it.

428
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,960
So that was a resolvable problem.

429
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,720
But the story just relays the flexibility

430
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,560
you have with Ting.

431
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,600
What other network could you do?

432
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,560
I don't think it'd be possible without it.

433
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,440
And when it's your own device,

434
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
when you're trying to troubleshoot something,

435
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,880
it's that same kind of flexibility.

436
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,320
If you wanted to buy a phone,

437
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,680
they have a bunch of great devices.

438
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,960
If you want to bring a device,

439
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,920
they have CDMA and GSM networks.

440
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,640
Just check their BYOD page.

441
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,100
Now, I was mentioning the data.

442
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,560
So they have a post right now.

443
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,240
I've mentioned it on a couple of other shows,

444
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,280
but I haven't mentioned it here.

445
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,040
And I just want to draw some attention to it.

446
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,880
They have a Hack Your Phone Plan blog post,

447
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,640
which I love because they've essentially

448
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,160
written up everything I do as a Ting user.

449
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,160
And it's how to have a smartphone plan under $20.

450
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,520
And that's really just because Uncle Sam's cut.

451
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,920
Otherwise, it'd be like $16.

452
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,700
I mentioned this on Linux Action News.

453
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,240
I'm probably going to mention it one more time

454
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,120
just because this is it.

455
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,480
People ask me all the time,

456
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,800
how do you have three Ting phones

457
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,320
and you're paying like around 40 bucks a month?

458
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,440
How are you doing that?

459
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,520
Well, this is how I do it.

460
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,240
That's the thing, they're even telling you.

461
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,080
They want to help you out and help you save money.

462
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,920
They're honey badger, dude.

463
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,760
Exactly.

464
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,820
So check it out, linux.ting.com.

465
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,120
It is a better way to do mobile.

466
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,200
Linux.ting.com, big thank you to Ting

467
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,520
for sponsoring the unplugged program.

468
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,080
So I was kind of planning to have somebody join us today

469
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,400
for the show to talk about the SnapCraft event,

470
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,440
just because why not get it from the horse's mouth.

471
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,920
However, they're really busy.

472
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,760
I was going to say,

473
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,800
sounds like they've got a lot on their plate.

474
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,440
And so these guys are so dedicated to this thing

475
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,460
that we are scheduling our interviews after hours tonight.

476
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,060
And we're going to be conducting interviews

477
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,800
into the evening when they're done working

478
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,120
because they got a lot of stuff they're trying to accomplish.

479
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,960
And then the other thing, the other wrinkle

480
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,180
is everybody's moving hotels around

481
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,080
because of the connectivity issue.

482
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,680
So that added a wrinkle to our plans.

483
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,080
But I have been collecting audio snippets here and there

484
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,920
and interviewing people, doing sidebar conversations.

485
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,200
So we still have tons of stuff to talk about.

486
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,480
And I want to back up just a little bit

487
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,760
because we got an email into the show a few weeks ago

488
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,080
and it said, you're talking about Flatpak,

489
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,000
you're talking about snaps.

490
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,240
I have no idea what you're talking about.

491
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,840
And I think it's because we've gotten so far

492
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,460
into universal packaging.

493
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,200
We've gotten so far into this discussion now.

494
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,020
There's some users out there

495
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,640
who just haven't used them at all.

496
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,340
Yeah, and so snaps are containerized software packages

497
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,560
that are supposedly supposed to be really simple

498
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,100
to create and install.

499
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,860
And in modern terms, when you say simple to create,

500
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,560
a lot of times what they're talking about is automated.

501
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,480
So you can connect it to like a GitHub repo.

502
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,400
And every time you upload a new build to GitHub,

503
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,840
it also generates a snap package.

504
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,000
Some CI server somewhere goes, does a new build,

505
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,520
runs tests, publishes it out there.

506
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,920
Yeah, and then the snap software on the client itself

507
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,400
checks in every 24 hours and can auto update if set.

508
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,360
And so it can be a way for like say Telegram

509
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,320
to just constantly be publishing new versions of Telegram,

510
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,560
auto update like you would a smartphone app only.

511
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,000
And the risks of doing that are minimal

512
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,320
because all of the dependencies,

513
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,960
all of the changes are contained to the snap.

514
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,920
The snap actually mounts as a file system

515
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,360
and it's a runtime in there.

516
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,040
And they have these portals out,

517
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,680
I think that might be Flatpak terminology,

518
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,520
but it's essentially to have these portals out

519
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,640
that allow them to get access to certain things.

520
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,480
I think that right there.

521
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,640
So like as a normal user,

522
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,400
I think right now I'd still be asking,

523
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,420
all right, so I can package them.

524
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,260
How is this different?

525
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,600
I already make devs today.

526
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,400
Why would I wanna try one of these new types of dependent,

527
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,040
you know, new types of systems?

528
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,520
Right, well, so let me tell you

529
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,600
who some of the people I've talked to while we've been here

530
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,120
to kind of put this in perspective.

531
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,400
Because I think that kind of makes the difference

532
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,960
because you gotta view it from their perspective.

533
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,520
Was it last week or two weeks ago,

534
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,800
we looked at MB and Plex.

535
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,920
Yep.

536
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,820
And I remember one of the things that I didn't expect

537
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,000
when I started looking into,

538
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,200
well, what does Plex do that is open source?

539
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,640
And I discovered they have just this monstrous amount

540
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,220
of open source projects.

541
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,040
Their GitHub page is like three or four pages deep

542
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:53,980
of open source projects.

543
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,480
You just next, next, next, next, next,

544
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,160
and there's still the full page of open source projects.

545
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,040
And they target my QNAP.

546
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,840
They target my Linux box.

547
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,400
They target Windows, Macs, Android devices,

548
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,880
all these different NAS devices.

549
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,660
All the smart TVs in the world.

550
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,760
Anything that can either be a Plex client

551
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,640
or a Plex server, they're targeting it.

552
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,000
So they actually have a team

553
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,500
that is just packaging up software constantly.

554
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,920
This is what this team does.

555
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,120
And how do you suppose they do that?

556
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,400
They do it with a series of scripts and systems.

557
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,200
Different for each different platform.

558
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,020
And every time it's time to add another platform,

559
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,280
it's this whole, geez, can we do another batch of work?

560
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,680
Can we do another platform?

561
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,640
Can we deliver it on a regular basis?

562
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,920
What are the esoteric issues?

563
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,640
Because this is ARM version this,

564
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,360
and this is an x86 version.

565
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,160
And then, oh, by the way, on some of these systems,

566
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,920
we're shipping something that opens up a web server

567
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,120
and listens to incoming connections and has an API.

568
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,700
Yeah, right, yeah, exactly.

569
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,300
Which is candidate number one

570
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,160
for containerized applications,

571
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,160
is anything that's taking remote connections.

572
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,420
So you can start to understand

573
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,520
how a universal packaging format

574
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,760
is extremely appealing to a company like Plex

575
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,040
that is contemplating, well, geez,

576
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,080
imagine if Chris's QNAP that runs Linux

577
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,720
actually has Ubuntu on it,

578
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,040
could just install Snap packages.

579
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,040
And then they could write one package.

580
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,840
And the thing about Snaps is you can have one Snap name,

581
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,400
and you can have a 32-bit version, and a 64-bit version,

582
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,760
and an ARM 32-bit version, and an ARM 64-bit version,

583
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,320
all published to the Snap store.

584
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,200
And when the user searches, Snap search Plex,

585
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,040
they just get the one that matches their-

586
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,900
Right, the client picks the architecture you're on, and-

587
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,520
That also solves another huge problem for them.

588
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,680
So Plex is one of the companies that's here.

589
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,560
Slack is here this week.

590
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,000
Folks from the Azure team are here this week.

591
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,960
Electron, specifically the builder side of Electron,

592
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,040
so maybe output to Snaps from Electron builder.

593
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,000
Right from the tooling.

594
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,920
.NET team is here, Skype team is here,

595
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,240
and Visual Studio Code team, as well as several,

596
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,840
I mean, those are just the companies

597
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,960
that I can remember talking to.

598
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,320
But there's several other companies here,

599
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,160
probably another handful of companies that are here,

600
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,520
all talking about how to solve these problems,

601
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,160
or this is what it can't do for me yet,

602
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,620
or this is what we'd like to see have done with it.

603
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,120
And then Canonical, and the people here in these rooms,

604
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,960
have to sit back and listen to all these people and go,

605
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,200
yeah, that's something we could do,

606
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,600
or, boy, I'm not sure if there's a use case,

607
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,360
but maybe we can make a compelling argument.

608
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,160
Their stance is, you give me a good enough reason, Plex,

609
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,480
and maybe we'll add that,

610
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,800
because we're in that phase right now.

611
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,320
And that's an important step, right,

612
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,480
is to solicit input from all the different parties

613
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,760
that might use your tooling,

614
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,920
so you can make the right design decisions.

615
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,000
And I feel like it is a competitive advantage

616
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,080
that Canonical has

617
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,240
for specifically driving this kind of adoption.

618
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,520
So I talked about what does it take to build a snap?

619
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,520
Well, it takes more than having a technical idea

620
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,960
and a way of building something.

621
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,000
It takes a business calling another business

622
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,860
and saying, you have something of value

623
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,360
that a user base wants.

624
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,440
We'd like to work with you,

625
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,000
and we'd like to solve a problem that you're having.

626
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,240
And that business goes,

627
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,080
we would really like that problem solved.

628
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,560
We will send resource X, Y, and Z to location B

629
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,080
that you have chosen business,

630
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,720
and the business is very good.

631
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,480
We will send personnel A, B, C, and D to this location,

632
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,760
and they will resource together.

633
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,800
Right, the kind of really boring, everyday details

634
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,760
that just needs to happen to make this make progress.

635
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,200
One of the few things that bureaucracies

636
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,280
are actually particularly good at

637
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,840
is this particular thing.

638
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,920
And when you're trying to get outreach and adoption

639
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,360
from folks like Electron and Unity

640
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,400
and Microsoft Azure,

641
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,560
you need somebody that's picking up the phone

642
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,200
and calling somebody else on the other end of that phone.

643
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,360
And as awesome as open source volunteers

644
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,480
and other things can be,

645
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,180
sometimes you just need someone whose job it is

646
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,680
explicitly to, nope, you'll be there these regular hours,

647
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,500
and you're making the phone call.

648
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,800
And you call it, well, you're on developer outreach.

649
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,640
That's what you might call it.

650
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
You're on developer outreach,

651
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,360
and so you're gonna be on developer outreach.

652
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,040
Well, what that means is it's your job

653
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,720
to get snaps adopted.

654
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,760
So go out there and find people that have problems to solve

655
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,000
and start solving them so that way we get adoption.

656
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,320
But somebody up ahead looking at the 50-foot level said,

657
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,200
you need to drive adoption for this.

658
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,600
How we're gonna drive adoption for this

659
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,280
is by listening to what they need,

660
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,800
adding it back into the product,

661
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,720
and then working with them to solve the problems.

662
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,200
So for Plex, that individual's gonna walk back

663
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,240
pretty much knowing this is gonna work for us or not.

664
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,200
Like, there is real, tangible value for Plex.

665
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,400
We spoke with insiders.

666
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,760
We've got commitments or not.

667
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,680
We did an attempted,

668
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,560
because the other thing is they're writing real code here too.

669
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,520
It's so they're, if you got an idea, let's write it out.

670
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,280
We can't go in the rooms.

671
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,120
We can't talk about it.

672
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:47,960
But at the same time,

673
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,760
like they've invited us to their Slack discussion.

674
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,800
So I'm seeing things that they're producing.

675
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,720
Oh, interesting.

676
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,040
And I can see things they're experimenting with

677
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,560
that they might try adding.

678
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,840
And you see it's, hey, you know, I'm just making,

679
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,240
I'm not gonna give any specific examples,

680
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,200
but Bob from Microsoft has this idea

681
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,400
of how we could scale this this way.

682
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,600
And I just did, I just, I just tried this.

683
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,000
So check out this branch and give it a go

684
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,880
and let me know what you think.

685
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,880
And then you see somebody else go,

686
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,920
well, yeah, that's a great idea,

687
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,880
but what about this dependency over here?

688
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,240
And it, to me, what it feels like a little bit is

689
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,840
sort of putting it directly.

690
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,920
You have a bunch of, you get a bunch of heavy hitters

691
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,600
together in a room for a little while.

692
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,120
And when they're out working in the remote field,

693
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,080
they're good, they're producing stuff.

694
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,880
They have control over their own,

695
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,680
they are masters of their own domain.

696
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,560
But sometimes for it to really hum,

697
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,640
you gotta get all the heavy hitters in one room

698
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,440
and you gotta connect them with partners

699
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,320
that you've created these relationships with,

700
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,920
and they gotta send their heavy hitters.

701
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,440
And it, to me, what I've noticed now here

702
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,680
and at NYC is it seems like you can get

703
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,680
eight or nine months of work done in four or five days.

704
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,000
Yeah, right, you have the right incentives

705
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,400
and you have synchronous communication, right?

706
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,640
All the people you want to talk with

707
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,200
or who could knock down walls for you,

708
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,240
they're right next to you.

709
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,360
And they're going to breakfast with you,

710
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
they're going to dinner with you,

711
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,200
and they're at the lunch.

712
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,720
That's the whole point of every one of your conversations.

713
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,920
Yeah, and you know, they're breaking off

714
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,040
into like beers on this night and stuff like that.

715
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,880
And you know what happens?

716
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,720
They talk about work.

717
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,880
In an excited way, right?

718
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,320
That's where you can really have those good ideas.

719
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,480
That's what they all have in common, right?

720
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,320
Is they have work.

721
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,280
And so same with the folks that they're bringing in

722
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,160
from out of town.

723
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,800
I feel like part of this discussion too should be that

724
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,960
a lot of these are companies or projects

725
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,960
that haven't fit into the typical Linux dependency story.

726
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,800
They're not part of Fedora.

727
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,680
They're not part of the standard Debian distribution.

728
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,600
They're really third party packages

729
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,960
and we haven't had a consistent answer.

730
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,040
And so that's why it's important that we have businesses

731
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,200
and major Linux stakeholders who are pushing forward on this.

732
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,880
Yeah, and it doesn't necessarily detract from AppImage

733
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,200
or Flatpaks either because I think what it really is doing

734
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,160
is it's just defining each of their marketplaces.

735
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,480
Like this is going to be the area

736
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,800
where snaps are especially competitive.

737
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,840
But I was having this conversation with Noah,

738
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,600
an area where I think Flatpaks are more competitive

739
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,520
is when you want to subscribe to an entire repository

740
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,360
of available possible software

741
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,480
that you could install and update at any future point.

742
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,400
And so as just an example, as Flatpaks,

743
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,440
the number one competitor to snaps,

744
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,720
essentially all of the development builds

745
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,720
of GNOME software are available as Flatpaks.

746
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,800
In the past, to get development builds of GNOME,

747
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,520
like if you wanted to run the next version of GNOME,

748
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,440
you would either have to run some distro

749
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,200
that was way out on the edge,

750
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,160
but even that would generally be delayed,

751
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,560
or you could get these builder scripts

752
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,560
that GNOME had created to build GNOME from source.

753
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,240
Right, it's not just apt-get.

754
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,480
It's like, okay, go figure out everything you need to know

755
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,480
to be a GNOME developer just to try this out.

756
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,880
And that's one thing when you're building an application,

757
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
when you're building in a desktop environment

758
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,400
and it's something that's getting frequently updated.

759
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,320
Yes, multiple layers of dependencies,

760
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
multiple applications.

761
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
And then imagine if you're a GNOME developer

762
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,120
and you just want to test against

763
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,760
the latest version of gedit.

764
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,720
What a nightmare.

765
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,160
Because you don't need all of GNOME,

766
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,520
but that's how you get it.

767
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,360
So what they've done is they've broken out

768
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,880
all the development packages of GNOME

769
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,200
into individual Flatpaks.

770
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,600
And so you subscribe to the Flatpak development repo

771
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,240
and you can get nightly, you can get different betas,

772
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,760
and I'm just giving kind of a rough example,

773
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,600
but you can subscribe to the software that you want,

774
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,240
and then from that repo you can install

775
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,560
and choose Polari or gedit.

776
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,440
You know, things, just individual components.

777
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,280
Interesting.

778
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,080
And they come down as Flatpaks, self-contained,

779
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,360
they don't mess with your main GNOME desktop's GTK

780
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,200
dependencies.

781
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,160
It's all packaged, compartmentalized, contained for you.

782
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,280
And I think that's something that Flatpak

783
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,280
will continue to be more competitive at

784
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,840
than Snap packages are.

785
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,400
Because Snappaks are like delivering

786
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,960
an individual application.

787
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,920
And Flatpak is capable of delivering an entire repository

788
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,840
that could show up as a browseable software menu

789
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,800
in GNOME software.

790
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,640
Whereas Snappaks show up as individual Snap entries.

791
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,480
Right.

792
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,800
I think it also kind of says, you know, this is still new

793
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,600
and we're still really fleshing out

794
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,080
what the full problem domain is.

795
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,560
What problems need to be solved

796
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,200
and in what approach will you take?

797
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,300
Yeah, they're just, they're not sitting still.

798
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,140
No, right?

799
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:15,960
It's very exciting.

800
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,360
They're like, well, we're going to figure out our stuff

801
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,880
right now.

802
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,960
So I think Bashful Fruit, you in the mobile room

803
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,800
said that your team in engineering

804
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,340
is looking at using Snaps.

805
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,880
Tell me about that a little bit.

806
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,880
Basically, here, I'm, yeah, hey, hey, how it goes.

807
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,620
Okay, so we are basically looking to use Snaps

808
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,140
to package up a bunch of our, I don't know,

809
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,780
I'm going to call them enterprising apps.

810
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,660
It has to do with remote access, things like that.

811
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,820
But we have Linux agents, Linux clients,

812
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,900
all that other kind of stuff.

813
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,860
And on an offhand chance today in a meeting,

814
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,060
I made a mention about them.

815
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,420
And now all of a sudden I've got like two or three

816
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,400
engineering teams coming over to talk to me about it

817
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,240
because they didn't know.

818
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,060
Now they kind of are peaked and interested and looking to go.

819
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,700
You've been experimenting, snapping up a few things,

820
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,380
haven't you?

821
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,340
Yeah, I got a few things.

822
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,340
I mean, up on the forums and stuff, I just finished Restic.

823
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,940
Popey took over the MumbleSnap that I started

824
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,740
mostly just because I got sidetracked.

825
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,780
And other than that, yeah, and then we're also looking

826
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,800
at how we're going to leverage it and Budgie as well.

827
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,740
So lots going on.

828
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,860
Yeah, the Mumble one could be particularly helpful for us

829
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,900
because sometimes people get hung up on installing Mumble

830
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,940
before they can join the show.

831
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,580
I mean, some people have problems with that.

832
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,740
So being able to just say, install this,

833
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,240
snap install Mumble.

834
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,940
Oh, that'd be great.

835
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,440
I literally installed it right before the show.

836
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,500
So yeah, you've had some experimentation.

837
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,460
So you feel like you're comfortable recommending it

838
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,420
to your place of work, huh?

839
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,260
Yep, definitely.

840
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,400
I don't see any problems with it.

841
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,060
Any of the little points to be ironed out,

842
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,620
they're already on their way.

843
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,940
So I mean, that's exactly why they're doing this

844
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,980
get together, so.

845
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,940
The main thing for me is theming,

846
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,460
but they're working on that.

847
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,300
Yeah, there's some-

848
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,780
Some of the server side stuff too, so.

849
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,140
I know that there's a sort of a big push on that right now.

850
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,420
I believe I've seen some threads going on about it

851
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,020
and they're looking at how they're going to sort of make

852
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,900
that look and work.

853
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,260
And I'd even seen another thread where they're talking

854
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,420
about being able to distribute themes as a snap.

855
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,380
So don't like 100% quote me on that,

856
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,540
but I've seen some talk about that as well.

857
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,300
But the fix is coming.

858
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,740
Hey, look at that, Dan from elementary says

859
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,460
he's using the mumble snap too.

860
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,540
Nice.

861
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,180
Dan actually has a little news from the project

862
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,580
I think we're going to talk about here in just a moment.

863
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,540
So Dan, get your medium post ready.

864
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,820
We'll bring that up here in just a couple of minutes.

865
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,660
I don't know.

866
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,700
Do you have anything else you think we should mention

867
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,540
about the event?

868
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,580
I think I'll probably play some of the audio we have

869
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,820
next week once we've had a chance to just review everything.

870
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,660
Yeah.

871
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:50,860
Initial impressions as our first.

872
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,660
My initial impressions, I guess would be

873
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,480
that it's been interesting to get insight

874
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,300
into the culture and community and stuff like that.

875
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,180
And being able to have some of the discussions,

876
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,860
even though we can't talk about them on air,

877
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,100
even though we can't record them or anything like that,

878
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,940
it informs our opinion and it makes us valuable

879
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,500
as a contact network because we're the only broadcasters

880
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,340
that are here.

881
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,180
That's true.

882
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,220
There are so many people that have this kind of insight.

883
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,380
We're lucky it's in our neck of the woods.

884
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,220
Yeah.

885
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,700
Well, you know, I think they recognize

886
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,060
that Jupiter Broadcasting is more important than that

887
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,700
because they brought us all the way up to New York

888
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,540
for that too, right?

889
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,360
Yeah, yeah.

890
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,200
In the same way.

891
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,040
Well, we brought ourselves out there,

892
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,880
but we were invited.

893
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,700
Invited, right.

894
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,460
So from the perspective of when people are looking

895
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,900
for tech news, and this is something I talked about

896
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,580
on our Snow Show last week, when people look for tech news,

897
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,700
you want people that have informed opinions,

898
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,980
people that are inside of the things

899
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,700
that they are talking about.

900
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,260
Man, I can't make the case any better.

901
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,060
I mean, we're sitting here with the Ubuntu guys

902
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,260
at the same rally where they're figuring this stuff out.

903
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,460
I don't want to give the impression though

904
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,460
that we're also getting like,

905
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,660
we're not getting the red carpet either.

906
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,480
Like we're working it.

907
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,140
Like we have to work for what we're getting too,

908
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,220
which is fair, fair enough.

909
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,260
I mean, they're here doing their thing.

910
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,100
We're here doing our thing.

911
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,060
That's how it should be really.

912
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,900
Yeah.

913
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,720
But yeah.

914
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,740
Okay, Mumbler, I thought I heard somebody speaking.

915
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,100
Does anybody want to jump in before we,

916
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,320
yeah, last bit of, yeah, go ahead.

917
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:10,340
I wanted actually to say that even though I can enjoy

918
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,020
that Canonical is doing all of this,

919
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,140
I just wish that they actually were,

920
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:17,980
had a more concerted developer documentation set.

921
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,700
And when they decide to build something,

922
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,700
to build that something actually maintain it.

923
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:27,260
As a developer, being a company or being, you know,

924
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,920
just an open source developer,

925
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,140
I want to be able to go to Canonical's page

926
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,340
or Ubuntu's page and go to developer docs.

927
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,720
Click there, click there, learn about that stuff

928
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,020
that there are the recommended tools

929
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,320
and be able to build, not need to attend an event

930
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,020
to figure how the things work.

931
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,380
I understand that they're doing research

932
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,320
and that's what they want to get out of that type of event

933
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,300
and so that they can build it better.

934
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,320
But you know, if they just actually do that part well,

935
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,640
I don't think we wouldn't even be spending that much

936
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,900
discussing these events.

937
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,540
Every company does these events.

938
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,300
I'm not taking this as a wild thing.

939
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,260
I think I disagree.

940
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,500
So I would say, first of all,

941
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:11,460
I wouldn't necessarily undersell docs.snapcraft.io.

942
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,140
I would check out docs.snapcraft.io

943
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,740
because it's pretty good documentation.

944
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,660
But the thing is, and somebody who's had clients,

945
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,140
it was an IT relationship, but I can tell you,

946
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,620
there are certain companies because of their status,

947
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,820
because of their workload,

948
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,900
because of their funding structure.

949
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,840
There is a trillion different reasons,

950
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,100
but I can tell you for sure that some of them

951
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,340
just have to have, by the way, Noah's got a call.

952
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,260
That's Noah's emergency Batline phone right there

953
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,740
if you heard that.

954
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,500
I can tell you there is some companies

955
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,140
that really have to have their handheld

956
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,820
and I don't want to sit here in Microsoft Bash,

957
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,780
but sometimes if you want to get Microsoft

958
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,100
to play ball a little bit,

959
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,940
you know, it just seems to be the way it goes.

960
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,780
I agree though, it would be great

961
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,900
if everybody could be involved

962
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,540
or if they could live stream this,

963
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,700
that would be really useful.

964
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,260
Look, no, not even asking for that.

965
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,100
That would even, you know,

966
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,580
if you just kind of get a...

967
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,340
This is one of the things that I've pointed out

968
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,820
multiple times that I believe that elementary

969
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,740
has done better than any other distro.

970
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,620
It has a set of tools that you can follow.

971
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,940
Like I'm not particularly a huge fan

972
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,700
of everything elementary does,

973
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,500
but this is the one thing done right.

974
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,140
You can look at it and know,

975
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,940
okay, this is what I need to pick up

976
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,420
to build for elementary.

977
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,660
And you go to Windows, Windows says,

978
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,500
C-sharp is the way to develop Windows.

979
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,340
Have you checked out that?

980
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,180
Apple says Swift.

981
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,100
I mean, I'm looking at it right now.

982
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,940
No, hold on a second.

983
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,580
First of all, I don't know that Windows,

984
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,140
I don't know that Windows is...

985
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,300
I don't know that you can compare the two.

986
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,580
Can you really compare Windows with Canonical?

987
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,420
No.

988
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,460
I mean, I would say just check out docs.snopcraft.io.

989
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,380
I'm not here to defend them.

990
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,100
I'm not here to say that one is better

991
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,820
or how they do it is better.

992
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,180
From my perspective, this is sort of

993
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,780
the way the business industry works.

994
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,980
And they're not doing it because it's not documented.

995
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,700
Because, and all again, all of this,

996
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,060
even like the YAML files and all of that

997
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,700
is pretty well documented.

998
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,380
So I feel like it's more about

999
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,800
connecting with certain companies

1000
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,220
that need their hands held,

1001
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,520
that need that one-on-one

1002
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,980
or have a special pony problem.

1003
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,380
And then the reason we're here

1004
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,660
is to relay that that's what this is about.

1005
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:10,100
There's a motivation from Canonical's standpoint

1006
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,780
to have Jupyter Broadcasting here.

1007
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,140
And it's not because they're big fans of Linux Unplugged.

1008
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:14,980
I mean, maybe it is.

1009
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,540
But I think it's probably because they want somebody

1010
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,820
relaying to the community what happens here.

1011
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,980
And what they want, and they're not telling us

1012
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,860
what to say, but...

1013
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,700
Talking about it, right?

1014
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,180
But Canonical wants to be shown

1015
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,620
that they're building these things.

1016
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,660
They're building these things.

1017
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,140
And this is what's happening in these events.

1018
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,380
So I think, because I think what the narrative could be

1019
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,980
if this wasn't, if we weren't here

1020
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,060
and there wasn't a third party sort of arbiter eyes

1021
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,300
on these, somebody could say,

1022
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,560
well, they're having these secret meetings

1023
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,620
with these secret companies.

1024
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,980
And they're not even saying what companies are there.

1025
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,460
They're not even disclosing any of this.

1026
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,460
They're just doing all these things behind the scenes

1027
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,660
and pulling the Canonical strings

1028
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,460
so that way Mark Shalloworth can orchestrate

1029
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,500
his master takeover over the Linux landscape

1030
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,700
because Mark Shalloworth wants to dominate Linux via snaps.

1031
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:59,200
And that is the narrative that gets perpetuated

1032
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,540
when they do these kinds of events.

1033
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,300
I think they've gotten hip to that.

1034
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,500
And they realize that they have to have

1035
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,740
some eyes on it.

1036
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,220
They have to have somebody watching, otherwise-

1037
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,140
That don't have an agenda.

1038
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,380
Yeah, otherwise it just gets spun like crazy.

1039
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,260
I mean, I can tell you that if this was like a,

1040
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,740
if this was like one of those,

1041
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,660
we'll have them come in here

1042
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,880
and we'll just have them just tell people what we're doing.

1043
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,340
And then we don't have to,

1044
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,680
you know, we'll just, this will all be taken care of.

1045
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,520
We wouldn't start the show

1046
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,540
with a Red Hat story buying out CoreOS

1047
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,780
because that's something that is directly goes

1048
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,100
against what Canonical's interests are

1049
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,000
in the enterprise and server market.

1050
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,500
I think it's, so they understand

1051
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,340
that we don't really have any,

1052
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,860
we don't have a particular skin in the game,

1053
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,960
but they still want people to know what happened.

1054
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,800
Right.

1055
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,220
And because otherwise it does come across as some,

1056
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,460
like it comes across as if Mark Shuttleworth

1057
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,340
is pulling some sort of puppet string.

1058
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,180
Yeah, exactly.

1059
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,020
He's not even here.

1060
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,840
He wants snaps to still feel like, you know,

1061
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,460
it's a community effort by an open source company.

1062
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,300
Yeah.

1063
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,300
Even if you don't get to see every last thing that-

1064
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,420
Right, I mean, the people that are working on it

1065
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,780
that are interfacing with these companies,

1066
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,780
like the Azure team and Plex are Wimby and Popey.

1067
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,940
And the people from Canonical, you've heard of before,

1068
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,340
they're just doing it in a setting

1069
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,220
that's sort of like common ground.

1070
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,140
Yeah, and I would be great, like,

1071
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,700
if you could have like pop-up, you know,

1072
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,540
how about this as an idea, like pop-up snap events

1073
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,620
where you need to different locations at a lug meetup

1074
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,840
or at a Linux event, maybe there's other ways to do this.

1075
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:25,620
But I don't think with, I think, I guess what I get back to

1076
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,700
is if AppImage had been doing this for every six months

1077
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,460
for the last couple of years,

1078
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,260
they'd probably be way ahead.

1079
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,220
If Flatpaks had, if Red Hat was cutting,

1080
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:40,740
I mean, $50,000 checks every six months,

1081
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,340
I mean, New York was way more than $50,000 probably.

1082
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:46,500
But this, you know, this is probably a 50, 25,

1083
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,100
you're paying all these people, you got hotel rooms,

1084
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,500
you got dinner, lunch, drinks for everybody for a whole week.

1085
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,820
It really shows an investment by the company.

1086
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,780
You're flying these people out from the UK,

1087
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,740
I mean, the majority of the staff

1088
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,180
are all coming from London and other places

1089
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,320
all over the world, they're not coming from the States.

1090
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,060
Some of them are, but most of them aren't.

1091
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,680
And that is a huge financial investment.

1092
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,040
I gotta believe that if Flatpaks did that,

1093
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:12,020
if another packaging format were doing that,

1094
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,380
it could do that, they would be doing that,

1095
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,340
because this is what it takes.

1096
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,380
It takes a sort of industry collaboration

1097
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:18,640
because you're reaching out not to other,

1098
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,800
you're not reaching out to businesses

1099
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,060
that have been making an open source product

1100
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,360
for the last 15 years, right?

1101
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,700
You're not trying to get crossover to package as a snap,

1102
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,180
because eventually they're gonna see the light

1103
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,020
because they're smart folks

1104
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,380
and they work in the open source community.

1105
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,940
You're reaching out to companies

1106
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,780
that have never done this shit before.

1107
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,140
And if I'm gonna pivot the packaging of my product,

1108
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,100
I wanna know there's someone I can call on the other side

1109
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,460
and be like, look, we need to get this fixed,

1110
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,300
you said you would help us.

1111
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,100
You want me to retask this 25-member team

1112
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,500
to package in your package format?

1113
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,500
How is this not a play for you to take over Lyft?

1114
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,420
You gotta make it as easy for them as possible.

1115
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,780
What problem are you solving for me

1116
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,620
to even wanna consider this, right?

1117
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,700
But there is also a comfort level in,

1118
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,580
oh, I can call up this canonical company

1119
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,180
and I can tell them they've gotta fix this problem

1120
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,740
or else we're out, so I see both sides of it.

1121
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:03,340
I do see both sides of it and I see why they have us here.

1122
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,540
I see what, I know what their motivation is.

1123
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,580
They want to make sure it's sort of understood

1124
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,440
what they're trying to do.

1125
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,280
It's a complicated thing.

1126
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,120
It really is.

1127
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,300
And we're here to observe like flies on the wall, Wes,

1128
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,260
searching out bandwidth at every opportunity.

1129
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,820
Linux-based flies, let's be clear.

1130
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,300
Yeah, hey, you know, there's one nice thing

1131
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,420
about coming to these kind of events

1132
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:24,780
is just about everybody, it's like a 95% Linux operation.

1133
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,660
You got a few people coming in from different companies,

1134
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,940
but even the people that are coming in

1135
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,380
from different companies, a lot of them are running Linux.

1136
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,220
Nice. Yeah.

1137
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,300
And it's a lot of MacBooks running Linux.

1138
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,580
It's a lot of MacBooks running Linux.

1139
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,500
Okay, I can take that.

1140
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,860
I saw some Unity bars. You walk around,

1141
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,700
you walk around, you see the front of it

1142
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,660
and it's like, oh man, and then you start walking around

1143
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,340
behind them, start looking over their shoulder

1144
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,580
and they're like, ah, those are all Mac.

1145
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it is.

1146
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:49,940
It's all Unity. You wanna see a tricked out setup.

1147
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,060
Oh, I know what you're gonna say.

1148
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,820
Wimpy's XPS 15 with Ubuntu MATE, he's got.

1149
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,980
Is that Ubuntu MATE? Yeah.

1150
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,060
Or is it Windows? No, no. Or is it Mac?

1151
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,900
Or, or, ah.

1152
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,140
He's got, he's got. I don't even know.

1153
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,780
He's got like, he's got all these different desktops

1154
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,020
set up with different stuff.

1155
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,380
Plus he's got virtual machines

1156
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,620
and he's got experimental high DPI builds

1157
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:08,420
where like stuff is dialed in on this version of MATE

1158
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,980
that is like, he's getting ready to, you know,

1159
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,020
put out there. Yep.

1160
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:15,140
Ooh, I had not seen it in person and it is.

1161
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,900
All the new hotness right there.

1162
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,620
It looks amazing.

1163
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,660
I think he's switching people to it just by.

1164
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,020
Just by using it, being around it.

1165
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:23,980
Yeah, Popey's switching.

1166
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,260
Yeah, Popey's like, I'm gonna give it,

1167
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,340
I'm gonna give it a go.

1168
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,620
Yeah, so, yeah.

1169
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,740
I actually, I actually switched, not to MATE.

1170
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,740
I switched to something completely,

1171
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,860
I got rid of, I got rid of my desktops.

1172
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,540
I won't go, I'm gonna save it for the show,

1173
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,100
but here, I'll give you a little hint.

1174
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,020
If you can, you can see right there.

1175
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,860
You see that right there?

1176
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,540
Oh, we're gonna, we're gonna, I gotta do an ad.

1177
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,380
We gotta do an ad, then we're gonna.

1178
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,200
You're right, yep.

1179
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,040
I just got distracted.

1180
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:46,860
All right, so let me tell you about DigitalOcean

1181
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,700
and then we'll get back there.

1182
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,380
DigitalOcean.com, I didn't forget.

1183
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,660
I just meant, I was just getting there.

1184
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,660
DigitalOcean.com, go over there and sign up.

1185
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,420
You know what, in fact, why don't,

1186
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,740
I'm gonna make this up right now.

1187
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,980
Let's just use a promo code.

1188
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,340
Let's just say it's DO Unplugged.

1189
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,460
Let's just say that, DO Unplugged, one word.

1190
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,020
You apply it to your account, you get a $10 credit.

1191
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,760
Let's just say, once you have a $10 credit,

1192
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,580
you can run the $5 rig two months for free.

1193
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,420
Let's just say that.

1194
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,980
And then maybe you discover

1195
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,260
that this machine's incredibly powerful

1196
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,700
and you didn't know Linux could do that much

1197
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,660
for $5 a month.

1198
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:14,580
And then say you get hooked,

1199
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,540
you wanna deploy another machine.

1200
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,740
Maybe you got an application you wanna deploy.

1201
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,180
You can get deployed, I mean,

1202
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,300
you got deployments for days.

1203
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,900
Deployments for days.

1204
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,220
You know, and if you wanna go play

1205
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,740
with some of that fancy new snap technology,

1206
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,940
go spin up an Ubuntu machine on DO, perfect.

1207
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,340
You can set up an automated build system

1208
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,580
or you can just play with some snaps.

1209
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,420
Boy, can you.

1210
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,900
The nice thing about DigitalOcean too

1211
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,060
is you just don't have to deal

1212
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,980
with any of those complex pricing structures.

1213
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,820
It's just simple.

1214
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,660
You always know what you get.

1215
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,980
It's predictable, it's scalable, it's reliable.

1216
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,240
99.99% uptime.

1217
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,860
You have an SLA for all services.

1218
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,980
You can deploy an entire application stack.

1219
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:49,420
Like the base Linux system, the software,

1220
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,460
like it's a GitLab, everything in one click.

1221
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,340
Or you can deploy the base Ubuntu system

1222
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,020
or base CoreOS system or CentOS system

1223
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,420
and then build on top of that.

1224
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,780
You get SSH access in, you get HTML5 console access.

1225
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,980
You can just get started faster.

1226
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,300
If there's some new open source project

1227
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,700
you wanna try out, see if it's worth your time.

1228
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,900
You don't wanna muck up your system.

1229
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,940
Oh, it's the best for that.

1230
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,260
So what I do, I go to this.

1231
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,500
And then the thing is, is it's so fast.

1232
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,580
It has easily increaseable storage.

1233
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,460
It has eight data centers all over the world.

1234
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,000
DigitalOcean's got data centers for days,

1235
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,060
data centers for days.

1236
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,500
So I just leave it in production.

1237
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,340
I just think it's perfectly good.

1238
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,860
And they've got all the little things

1239
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,380
you might want to make that work too.

1240
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,900
Firewalls, monitoring, built right in.

1241
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,780
Yep, yep, easy, easy peasy.

1242
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,400
In fact, it's really easy now

1243
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,700
with their new DigitalOcean spaces to do automated backups.

1244
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,680
If you check out their community page,

1245
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,320
they posted on my birthday a blog,

1246
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,660
or no, I guess a tutorial, because blog

1247
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,500
would be underselling it.

1248
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,140
Because these are well-crafted, well-written tutorials.

1249
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,820
Beautifully done, elegant tutorials.

1250
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,420
Johnny Ive white room tutorials.

1251
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,260
And they're great.

1252
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,740
And so this is one about doing automated backups

1253
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,100
with DigitalOcean spaces.

1254
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,100
Go there, try it out.

1255
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,860
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1256
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,640
I wouldn't be in this hotel ballroom

1257
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,660
if it wasn't for DigitalOcean.

1258
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,020
So thanks DigitalOcean, and thanks to you guys

1259
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:06,860
for sponsoring the show.

1260
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,020
DigitalOcean.com.

1261
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,420
Linux boot, let Linux do it, is their tagline.

1262
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,700
And that should be everyone's tagline.

1263
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,820
Just let Linux do it.

1264
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,100
That should be Ask Noah's tagline.

1265
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,520
Yeah, right, so I think the big deal here

1266
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,340
is that from the user perspective, UEFI works okay.

1267
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,460
But it's a giant, bigger than the kernel,

1268
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,780
inscrutable code base.

1269
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,260
It's a big mess.

1270
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,940
And we already have a code base that we know and love.

1271
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,780
And it's called Linux.

1272
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,980
Yeah, and it does a great job, it does.

1273
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,540
And so they write, are you tired, like this,

1274
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,560
are you tired of reinventing the wheel

1275
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,620
by implementing drivers for firmware again and again?

1276
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,660
Not with Linux boot.

1277
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,500
To the rescue.

1278
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,380
Yeah, I know, just set it and forget it.

1279
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:50,100
So Linux boot is a firmware for modern servers

1280
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,580
that replaces specific firmware functionality,

1281
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:56,840
like UEFI DXE phase, with a Linux kernel and a runtime.

1282
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,680
They say it will improve boot reliability

1283
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,540
by replacing the lightly tested firmware in drivers,

1284
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,260
improves boot time by just removing unnecessary code,

1285
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,740
makes it 20 times faster to boot,

1286
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:09,020
which is actually kind of nice on a server,

1287
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,380
especially when you're trying to get up in an outage.

1288
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,860
And they say it's a proven approach

1289
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,860
for almost 20 years in military, consumer electronics,

1290
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,500
and supercomputing systems,

1291
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,540
whenever reliability and performance are paramount.

1292
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,440
I don't actually know what that means,

1293
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,700
because the only supercomputers that I've had experience with

1294
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,060
are actually often initiated by other computers.

1295
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,000
So an entire standard PC boots up

1296
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,220
and then initiates the cluster of supercomputers.

1297
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,060
So I don't really know what that means.

1298
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,300
Yeah, I'm a little curious what they mean.

1299
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,780
But I'll go with it, I'll roll with it.

1300
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,980
I mean, you know, Linux has been data center for a while.

1301
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,500
And they may just mean the approach, too.

1302
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,540
You know, they just mean simplifying

1303
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:42,340
and relying on one shared code base.

1304
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:45,740
Linux boot, linuxboot.org.

1305
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,940
See, I'm pretty excited, because you know me, Chris.

1306
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,380
I just love me some Kexec.

1307
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,220
And that's a whole integral part here.

1308
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,540
You are a big guy.

1309
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,620
So that's how they're doing this?

1310
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,860
Well, yeah, so the idea here is that-

1311
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,900
Wes will literally go two weeks

1312
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,700
and not even install a bootloader on his machine.

1313
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,340
He's like, I just Kexec it.

1314
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,060
I just load in the one that works and Kexec it.

1315
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,220
Yeah, it works so well.

1316
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,340
Yeah, so the idea here, right,

1317
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,740
is like you still have some firmware,

1318
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:07,580
and that'll vary.

1319
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,660
Maybe it's a little bit of UEFI.

1320
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,380
Maybe it's core boot or, you know,

1321
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:13,660
you boot on one of those ARM systems.

1322
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,180
That does some of the firmware initialization,

1323
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,460
the bare sort of stuff to get the CPU started,

1324
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,500
the system running, and then you just boot a kernel.

1325
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,620
Because the kernel already has a whole bunch of code

1326
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,660
for driver and device initialization.

1327
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,500
I see.

1328
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,340
So you get that.

1329
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,660
You have a little helper in it, RAMFS, if you need.

1330
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:28,620
There's a couple different implementations of that.

1331
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:31,380
And then, you know, get your root device supported.

1332
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,860
You do some pixie booting if you need to.

1333
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,620
Once you get the real kernel, Kexec in there.

1334
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:37,460
Away you go.

1335
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,280
Bob's your uncle.

1336
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,120
Yep.

1337
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,960
That is great.

1338
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,300
It's funny how quickly,

1339
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,740
I guess funny isn't the right word to say,

1340
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,700
but it's awesome, it's so badass,

1341
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,500
how Linux really gets its shit together quickly

1342
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,340
on this stuff.

1343
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,500
It's like, oh, we've got these three or four

1344
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,640
technology stacks that we could leverage to do this now.

1345
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,620
Where like stuff in Windows comes along,

1346
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,260
and it'll literally sit in Windows for 20 years unused,

1347
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,140
and it just never gets taken advantage of.

1348
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,820
The system never really improves.

1349
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:05,120
But we come up with these three or four disparate projects,

1350
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,340
and we all combine them together,

1351
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,780
and now you've got a head secure runtime.

1352
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:12,060
You're using Nerfs for, or just Nerf and Uroot,

1353
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:16,500
and a NITRAMFS, and all this crazy great kernel functionality

1354
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,900
that are all being written by different people.

1355
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,460
And smoosh it all together,

1356
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,540
and I think you've got something great

1357
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,420
that seems like it doesn't happen

1358
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,020
on the commercial platforms as much.

1359
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,020
And it's interesting here too,

1360
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,580
because you see some of the big names involved here.

1361
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,920
People like Google and Facebook,

1362
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,580
and they're seeing some real problems they have

1363
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,900
in their actual businesses that they're trying to solve.

1364
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,540
And they're doing that by leveraging open source technology,

1365
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,820
working together to extend it,

1366
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,780
which is pretty exciting.

1367
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,900
Well, we'll see.

1368
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,220
We'll see how long it takes to actually get out there.

1369
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,740
Yeah, right now there's about two test devices you can use,

1370
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,700
so whether or not the C's real world data set

1371
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:50,620
or deployments, I don't know.

1372
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,740
I just want it on a laptop.

1373
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:52,580
Yeah, exactly.

1374
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,220
Ooh, you know, that would be so great.

1375
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,060
Something on there.

1376
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:56,780
So yeah, I guess I'm feeling this

1377
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,220
because I've been reloading machines.

1378
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:01,300
Again, this is the cross that I bear.

1379
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,500
I can't help myself.

1380
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,340
I can't help myself.

1381
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:04,840
Yeah, you stopped being the Linux switcher,

1382
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,620
and yet you're still the Linux.

1383
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:08,120
Somehow, somehow.

1384
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,280
Yeah, so Marko is just joining us.

1385
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,140
Marko joining us live over at jblive.tv.

1386
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,500
We do Linux Unplugged live on Tuesdays.

1387
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,980
This week we're on location in downtown Seattle,

1388
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:22,300
and we are live at a canonical Snap event,

1389
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,060
their January SnapCraft Summit,

1390
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,580
I think is what they're calling it.

1391
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,900
And we're here sort of being flies on the wall.

1392
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,300
And so Wes is joining me, Noah is joining me,

1393
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,540
and the Mumble Room is joining me,

1394
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,780
and now Marko in the chat room is joining us.

1395
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,100
So you can join us too.

1396
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,340
Go to discord.me slash Jupiter Colony,

1397
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,100
and the chat room, there's a Linux Unplugged chat room

1398
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,380
in there that goes all the time.

1399
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,700
So if you wanna join the show and talk about anything

1400
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,180
that you saw going across the chat screen,

1401
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:47,120
if you watch the video version,

1402
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,220
you can go in there and find it, you can get links.

1403
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:52,780
The conversation continues in there.

1404
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,620
So there's a really big conversation kicking off this week

1405
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:58,700
around client-side decorations again.

1406
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,800
I don't know if you guys remember client-side decorations,

1407
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,800
but they're like those header bars on No Maps,

1408
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,660
GEdit's got it, Corebird's got it.

1409
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:10,100
Funny, most GNOME desktop applications have it now

1410
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,140
except for Nautilus and Terminal,

1411
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:14,460
which is the ones I use the most.

1412
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,140
But client-side decorations is sort of solving

1413
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,800
a couple of problems for the GNOME desktop,

1414
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,340
and so they're pretty hot on it.

1415
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:25,700
It is solving some Wayland transition issues

1416
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,560
where applications would be responsible

1417
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,640
for drawing their own decorations.

1418
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,740
And when I say decorations, I'm talking like the title bar.

1419
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,940
I'm talking like the close, minimize, maximize.

1420
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,620
The title bar around your application,

1421
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,860
the borders around your application

1422
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,660
are often referred to as decorations.

1423
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:45,620
And the GNOME project is pretty keen on the idea

1424
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:48,840
of applications drawing their own borders,

1425
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:52,940
drawing their own titles, their own decorations,

1426
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,500
and doing it in a way that sort of brings everything

1427
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,740
into that bar.

1428
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,540
So instead of having a separate file edit menu

1429
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:02,460
and a title bar, it's all in one combined bar.

1430
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:05,260
And if you go look at screenshots of GNOME Builder,

1431
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,400
you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.

1432
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,340
And in a blog post that they did recently,

1433
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,260
there is, Tobias, I believe, did it,

1434
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,980
there is a blog post that shows,

1435
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,860
what would Telegram and Slack look like

1436
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,060
if they use client-side decorations?

1437
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,980
And they're down there towards the bottom of the post.

1438
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,380
And I gotta admit, it legitimately looks good.

1439
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,720
And this is a conversation that they've started before

1440
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,900
that the folks on the Plasma and KDE side of the camp

1441
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:34,060
have rejected, saying, we've come up with a cross-desktop

1442
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,860
protocol that we could use,

1443
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,500
we have these server-side decorations

1444
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,160
that we think are great, and oh, by the way,

1445
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,880
if you've got client-side decorations,

1446
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,280
if that application crashes, well, it's responsible

1447
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,380
for drawing title bars, so now the title bars crash,

1448
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:47,860
so it's much harder to move it around,

1449
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:51,020
and the windows froze, and they've been iterating

1450
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,020
and discussing these problems and iterating

1451
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,900
on that discussion, what's wrong with client-side

1452
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,500
decorations, and so there was just sort of a stalemate.

1453
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,740
Gnome went ahead and just kept doing some stuff,

1454
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,940
client-side decorations, CSDs, but it kind of slowed down,

1455
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:04,780
not a lot of projects.

1456
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,100
Probably haven't even talked about it

1457
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,420
for it seems like at least a year.

1458
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,740
No, although in the background, so Firefox 59's

1459
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,460
coming out next, and it's implementing client-side

1460
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,100
decorations as an option when you go configure the toolbars.

1461
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:20,400
So I thought, I really need to get a perspective on this,

1462
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,460
because as funny as it is, this problem isn't going away,

1463
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,780
and every time it comes up, each camp gets even more

1464
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:30,340
sort of entrenched in their view of what's right

1465
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:33,540
and what's wrong, and the language is getting

1466
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,580
a little more hostile now, it's getting

1467
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,200
a little more aggressive, and so.

1468
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,580
Away from a technical discussion,

1469
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:42,980
and suddenly people have stakes now, and it's emotional.

1470
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,540
And so what is it all about?

1471
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:46,460
Does this even matter?

1472
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,780
Is this all a bunch of crap for very little gain?

1473
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:53,240
So I wanted to understand why the Gnome project wants this,

1474
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,980
because I get why the K-Win developers

1475
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:57,620
think it's not so great, and we'll get to all of that

1476
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,860
in just a moment, I'll talk about some of that.

1477
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,020
So, even though I thought I was gonna be staying

1478
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:09,560
on Unity 7 until 1804 came around, I.

1479
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,220
You've been singing Unity's praises for months now.

1480
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,980
I thought, you know, I need to just have

1481
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,380
some handle on this, so I Gnomed up.

1482
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,400
I Gnomed up all over the place.

1483
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,180
I started with that Arch machine that you had

1484
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,980
on the MacBook, got it all up to date,

1485
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,360
got my Gnome 3 all dialed in, I was like,

1486
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,500
all right, well now I'm just gonna move another machine,

1487
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,940
another machine, another machine, it's how I do.

1488
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:30,000
And each time I sort of build on it and build on it.

1489
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,660
And I went all in, I got a beta build of Gnome,

1490
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,140
or I'm sorry, I had a Firefox 59,

1491
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,380
so I had Firefox with client-side decorations.

1492
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:40,520
I configured MailSpring to use client-side decorations.

1493
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,260
I loaded up CoreWord, which uses client-side decorations.

1494
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,080
I went.

1495
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:44,920
You went full CSD.

1496
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,720
Yeah, I went full CSD, full, full CSD.

1497
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,340
So I'm gonna talk a little bit about that.

1498
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:51,520
I want to talk about what Martin, the K-Win developer,

1499
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,180
why he doesn't like this, and where I ended up.

1500
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,060
And then we'll wrap it all up, like I said,

1501
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:57,600
at the top of the show with an app pick

1502
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,640
that I think's the best terminal emulator I've ever used.

1503
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,220
So that's where we're going next.

1504
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,500
So why don't we take a moment and thank Linux Academy.

1505
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,420

00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,980
How about that, huh?

1516
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,420
That's, I get a sense of the scale of the platform.

1517
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,540
It really is, it's everything you need,

1518
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:32,620
from hands-on labs to instructor mentoring,

1519
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,860
learning paths, which are a series of courses

1520
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,500
and content that is planned by instructors

1521
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,940
for specific career tracks.

1522
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:40,420
If you're busy as heck, they got course schedulers

1523
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,060
so you can set a timeframe and fit to it

1524
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,840
and it'll help you set learning goals.

1525
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,240
If you're a bad tester, they have practice exams

1526
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,380
to help you get ready for certifications,

1527
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,620
test what you've learned,

1528
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:51,780
and they also have courses created specifically

1529
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,820
to prepare you for certification exams.

1530
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:56,260
They have cloud servers that they spin up on demand

1531
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,920
to help you do the courseware

1532
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,540
in real-world production situations.

1533
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,820
Shoot, that's worth it right there.

1534
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,020
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1535
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,940
And you can also go all NOAA, go full Brown Bear

1536
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,580
and go offline with their comprehensive study guides,

1537
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,060
their lesson audio, their personal notebooks.

1538
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,100
You don't need the cloud for any of that.

1539
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,140
You can learn Linux with that stuff too, offline.

1540
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:21,460
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1541
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,340
And check out the community section, like the forums.

1542
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,980
You may find a fellow Jupiter broadcasting member lurking.

1543
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,040
There's plenty of them.

1544
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,980
A vibrant community that's there to help you.

1545
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,580
They fork study cards.

1546
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,860
They really make it worth it.

1547
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,940
And then Linux Academy is revising content.

1548
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:35,900
They're keeping it up to date

1549
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,060
and they're adding new content and an incredible clip,

1550
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,180
consistently making your subscription worth it.

1551
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,900
Right, I mean, they can't make it no work.

1552
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,140
You're still gonna have to put in some time,

1553
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,620
learn the content, play around with Linux,

1554
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,340
but they knock down just about every single other obstacle

1555
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,180
I can think of.

1556
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,020
And they're gonna help you get your head around it.

1557
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:50,860
Yeah.

1558
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:54,620
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1559
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,500
So let's talk about the Kaywin side of things here.

1560
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,220
So Gnome likes it for the aesthetic value

1561
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,300
that solves some Wayland problems for them.

1562
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,820
And the number one thing is it uses less

1563
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,660
vertical real estate.

1564
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:04,140
You know, you're getting less stuff up in the top.

1565
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,780
Some of the well done ones, it looks pretty nice.

1566
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,820
Yeah. I don't hate it.

1567
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:07,940
And on widescreen displays,

1568
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:10,380
it's nice to get more vertical real estate.

1569
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:13,300
But Martin on his blog writes that

1570
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:18,220
he's not a big fan of this and he calls it a situation.

1571
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:21,060
He says that the Gnome shell and Western require client

1572
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:24,420
side decorations, but KDE Plasma and Sway do not.

1573
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,180
In fact, the Plasma folks,

1574
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,780
which I believe Martin was the one who drafted this,

1575
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,100
created a protocol supported by GTK,

1576
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,420
although it is broken currently, I've been told,

1577
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,780
that allows to negotiate with Wayland compositor,

1578
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,340
whether it's using server side decorations

1579
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:40,180
or client side decorations.

1580
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:43,340
In fact, he says the don't believe Gnome,

1581
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:45,140
don't implement CSDs.

1582
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,420
You can ask them to support server side decorations

1583
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,260
if that's how you feel.

1584
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,260
They could do it because they need to do it

1585
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,440
for X Wayland anyways.

1586
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:54,620
That's a good point right there.

1587
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,020
If you've got to do it for X Wayland anyways.

1588
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,020
Hmm.

1589
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,540
He says that I totally don't understand.

1590
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,660
I totally understand you toolkit developers

1591
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,900
that don't want to implement your own client side decoration.

1592
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,500
It's a lot of work and it's difficult to make it look good

1593
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:09,580
and not alien on different desktop environments.

1594
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,420
I don't know.

1595
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:12,460
You know, I don't know.

1596
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:15,780
If you ever seen Slack on Windows or Mac,

1597
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:17,820
I think that's using client side decorations essentially.

1598
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:22,180
So you can make it work, but they have a good point.

1599
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:25,060
You have to solve this problem for X Wayland anyways.

1600
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,660
You still have all of these developers

1601
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,460
who aren't going to want to create that

1602
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,800
because it's a pretty big visual piece of your application

1603
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,920
all of a sudden that you maybe aren't even out

1604
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,300
for designing correctly.

1605
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,300
So I see both sides of the camp.

1606
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,580
So I say, I got to just run these.

1607
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,220
I got to run this.

1608
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,540
And I'll say, you know, I'll say it's nice.

1609
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:45,500
It is really nice from a visual standpoint,

1610
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:50,100
but I ran it for just three days.

1611
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:53,100
And in that time, sure as shit,

1612
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,600
Gnome crashed on me four times at least.

1613
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:59,180
And our friends at Canonical just recently iterated

1614
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,620
that one of the reasons they're shipping XOR and 1804

1615
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:05,540
as default is because when Gnome crashes,

1616
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:08,580
when Gnome shell crashes on Wayland, it is catastrophic.

1617
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,580
Oh yeah, I mean, that's it.

1618
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,860
It is the display server.

1619
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:11,700
That's it.

1620
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,380
See, when you're on X, yeah, when you're on X,

1621
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,620
you have the luxury of X still running.

1622
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:18,260
You can reconnect to X and Gnome just sort of pops back up

1623
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:20,140
and your applications look all shitty for a second

1624
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,460
and everything's fine.

1625
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:24,580
But on Wayland, it's a crash.

1626
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:28,820
And I'm sitting like, this thing crashed on me four times,

1627
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,140
four times in three days.

1628
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:35,980
And oh my gosh, if Gnome hasn't had some Gnome issues here.

1629
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,500
This isn't, I don't mean to be a Gnome bashing issue,

1630
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,500
but this matters.

1631
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,700
You've had full crashes.

1632
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,700
And if we were in a Wayland future.

1633
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,500
Well, here's my issue.

1634
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,940
We went to sit down to do shell prep today.

1635
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:48,900
And I think I was sitting there next to you

1636
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,340
for when I pulled my laptop out for 35 seconds,

1637
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,180
oh, Gnome crashed.

1638
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,580
And what was frustrating was I was,

1639
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,420
the reason I pulled my laptop out.

1640
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:56,260
You had a great idea.

1641
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,860
Why have the memory fish of a goldfish?

1642
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:58,700
Yeah, you have the memory of a goldfish.

1643
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,980
Yeah, and so I wanted to dump something down

1644
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,780
and I opened up a text editor, got one sentence into it

1645
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:03,860
and the whole thing just dumps.

1646
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,380
Of course, I lose all my work.

1647
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:06,420
And you don't know what you were trying

1648
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,260
to write down anymore.

1649
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,460
Right, well, it was frustrating.

1650
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,820
And then I went to recover

1651
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:14,100
and the entire, the system locked up so hard

1652
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:15,620
that I had to physically power the computer off

1653
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,140
and then power back up.

1654
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,220
And by the time I got through that

1655
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,940
and remembering my encryption password

1656
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:22,100
and getting back into Linux

1657
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:23,540
and opening up the text editor

1658
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,780
and getting back to what I was doing,

1659
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:26,060
by the time I did all of that,

1660
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:27,780
I forgot what I was going to say,

1661
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,220
which turned out not to be a big deal

1662
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,620
because about five minutes after that, it crashed again.

1663
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:32,860
And then we closed and moved rooms

1664
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,980
and I came back into a different room

1665
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,540
and it crashed a third time.

1666
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:37,820
And so, and the question,

1667
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:39,700
what you and I were talking about is.

1668
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,740
What are they going to do about this?

1669
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,700
Yeah, I'm the dedicated,

1670
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,380
I'm a pretty dedicated Linux user, right?

1671
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,700
Like to the point that, you know,

1672
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,380
if my choice was between Linux

1673
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,540
and no computer at all,

1674
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:48,900
I'd probably use no computer at all.

1675
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,940
And if I am getting frustrated

1676
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,980
and joking about, well, maybe I should use Windows

1677
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:53,900
so at least I can get through the show

1678
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,980
and then I'll go back to using Linux.

1679
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,860
If I'm making those jokes,

1680
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,020
what is the next guy that's like,

1681
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,780
ah, I was kind of in between, but you know.

1682
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,380
And here's what has me scared a little bit.

1683
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,740
And I mean scared,

1684
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:03,980
it actually really is something

1685
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:06,700
that I'm a little worried about here is

1686
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:09,500
the GNOME team has a fork in the road ahead of them.

1687
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,340
And what they're discussing right now

1688
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:14,460
up on their Wiki and on the IRC room and whatnot

1689
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:18,860
is GNOME 4, do we re-architecture GNOME

1690
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,240
and make it modular?

1691
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,780
So we break out mutter,

1692
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:24,220
we break out all the compositing stuff completely separately.

1693
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,980
We break out the shell,

1694
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,540
we break out the graphics effects,

1695
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,580
we break out the extension architecture,

1696
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:34,200
which also means we create a standard API.

1697
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,780
We have to create an IPC communication system

1698
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,340
for all these different modularized components

1699
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,740
to communicate with each other.

1700
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:42,260
There can't be any drop in state or delay,

1701
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,320
or, and if we do that,

1702
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,960
we break every single extension in existence today.

1703
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,140
And mind you today, these guys,

1704
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,900
the way the extensions work in GNOME Shell 3

1705
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:56,520
is they're just hot swapping out JavaScript code

1706
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,580
in the GNOME Shell.

1707
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,580
It's not like these extensions are talking to GNOME

1708
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:02,780
and saying, I would like to put a meter up in the toolbar.

1709
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:05,740
They're just slicing that code in their hot dog style,

1710
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,340
a hot dog down a hallway.

1711
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:10,340
And that is dangerous.

1712
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,380
That's not how you want a professional desktop run.

1713
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:13,220
You know what I'm saying?

1714
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:15,660
Like, so they, but at the same time,

1715
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,360
critical functionality of GNOME 3

1716
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,460
is provided by these extensions.

1717
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:20,820
And we want that, we would,

1718
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,220
especially if GNOME's gonna concentrate

1719
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,460
on sort of a small core,

1720
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:25,980
you're gonna need those for a workable desktop.

1721
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:27,680
And so the GNOME project's like,

1722
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,780
well, you know, we tell people

1723
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,120
if we get rid of the system tray

1724
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,820
to go to the top icons extension.

1725
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,820
Well, we tell people when we get rid of desktop icons

1726
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:35,260
to go to the desktop extension.

1727
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,860
And now do we go break all extensions on people?

1728
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:40,180
Imagine if Firefox took away bookmarks

1729
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,820
and said, we'll just use an extension for bookmarks.

1730
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,500
And then two releases later,

1731
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,180
they broke the bookmark extension.

1732
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:47,920
So there's no more bookmark extension.

1733
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,700
Well, you just told me to get the bookmark extension.

1734
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,540
How can you go and break it two releases later?

1735
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:52,840
That's the position they're in now.

1736
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,900
So they either break all extension in existence

1737
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,860
that make GNOME a usable environment to begin with,

1738
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:01,120
or they kick the can down the road.

1739
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,140
They create maybe an API or something,

1740
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:06,080
and they don't address this core architectural issue

1741
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,020
that if you think about it is a massive challenge.

1742
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:10,180
And so it's not that I,

1743
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:13,020
GNOME is my favorite desktop environment, hands down.

1744
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:16,120
It's the one I, if it never crashed on me,

1745
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:16,960
it would be the one-

1746
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,800
You'd be there all day.

1747
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,540
I'd be at the top of the roof right now at this hotel,

1748
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:23,900
29th floor, screaming about how great GNOME Shell is.

1749
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,820
I just, I can't when I can't even make it a few days

1750
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:30,220
without it taking a huge dump on me.

1751
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:33,300
And now having a little more insight

1752
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,860
into what's causing these problems,

1753
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:40,180
I see that they have a massive technical hurdle to overcome.

1754
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,020
And-

1755
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:41,900
It feels very different, right?

1756
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:44,340
Like for a while, especially after like 320 or something,

1757
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:46,500
we kind of talk about, GNOME felt stable again, right?

1758
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,860
It was like, okay, let's see what they've done.

1759
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:50,020
As any software project grows though, right?

1760
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,980
And as you add more extensions,

1761
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,740
and the answer can't be no extensions.

1762
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,060
It just loses, it just,

1763
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,740
I think also Wes, the thing is,

1764
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:01,500
it's the Wayland pressure because now crashes

1765
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,120
have way more consequence.

1766
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,020
It's not just a repop of the shell.

1767
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,500
It's you lose everything that you're working on

1768
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,580
and you reboot the machine.

1769
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,260
And we're in that awkward middle ground now

1770
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:12,260
where before it was sort of like,

1771
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,100
oh, if Wayland's a crashy mess, it doesn't matter.

1772
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,460
No one's really using it,

1773
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:17,700
but people are starting to use it for real things

1774
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,500
in real production applications.

1775
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:22,860
And if it's not up to the task, that's a serious issue.

1776
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,700
Yeah, well, they're making hard decisions in GNOME Shell

1777
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:30,380
that if they can't figure out how to do it in Wayland and X,

1778
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,740
and they can only figure out how to do it in Wayland,

1779
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,100
they just drop the X version.

1780
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,180
Some of the things we're seeing happen to GNOME Shell

1781
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:37,060
are really about getting ready for Wayland.

1782
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:38,540
And just a couple of weeks ago,

1783
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,540
we talked about how the Kaywin project

1784
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,220
is a Wayland first project now.

1785
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:45,500
And X11 is now in indefinite maintenance mode for them.

1786
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,300
So we are making that transition.

1787
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,140
It's happening whether you want to or not.

1788
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:51,140
Fedora's shipping it, Ubuntu 17.10 is shipping it.

1789
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:55,980
And GNOME is making a huge ask with these client-side

1790
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:59,740
decorations when they're in sort of a tedious position.

1791
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,220
Because the tedious part of it is,

1792
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:05,460
they have bigger distro support than they've ever had.

1793
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,660
All of the major distros are shipping GNOME desktops

1794
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,340
right now, all of the corporate desktops.

1795
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:10,180
It's kind of their heyday in one sense.

1796
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,700
Right, unless you're Blue Systems,

1797
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,660
everything you're shipping is a GNOME desktop.

1798
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:17,180
So they are in a great position,

1799
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,980
but the tedious part of it is they can't really use

1800
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,380
that leverage because there's these fundamental

1801
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,420
architectural issues that everybody

1802
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:24,660
behind the scenes is going,

1803
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:25,980
this is a big problem, I don't know what the hell

1804
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:26,820
we're gonna do about this, I'm freaking out.

1805
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:28,140
Yeah, what's gonna happen with GNOME, we don't know.

1806
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:31,940
Yeah, and so it was with that background

1807
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,780
that I was like, okay, this is an interesting time

1808
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:35,840
that they're choosing to bring this up.

1809
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:39,220
Dan, I don't know if we have Mr. Dan Rabbit's audio again,

1810
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:41,180
but I wonder if anyone has thoughts on the client-side.

1811
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,300
Yeah, Dan, what do you think about this client-side

1812
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,660
decoration conversations come up again,

1813
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:49,140
especially from an elementary OS desktop standpoint?

1814
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,780
Well, we've been all in on client-side decorations

1815
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:56,740
for a couple of releases now, so they work fine.

1816
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:01,740
And like you said, the space-saving thing is really good.

1817
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:04,860
One big thing about client-side decorations that you get

1818
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,820
is they're actually integrated with applications

1819
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:09,980
that wanna use the dark style instead of server-side

1820
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:12,500
decorations that aren't aware of the application's content

1821
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:16,460
so they can't adapt correctly.

1822
01:02:16,460 --> 01:02:19,700
We also have a facility in elementary OS for developers

1823
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:22,380
to be able to set brand colors in their applications.

1824
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,740
So a lot of the title bars for applications in App Center

1825
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,420
are branded colored instead of just plain,

1826
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,860
you know, with the same for every app.

1827
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,520
Like there's a lot more interesting color in the UI.

1828
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,600
Yeah, I have seen that and I do really like

1829
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,540
the way that looks.

1830
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:39,220
I've also seen people make certain buttons stand out more

1831
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:41,540
that, you know, like my eyes drawn to it more

1832
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:42,840
because it's like a certain color of blue

1833
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,940
that really pops or something.

1834
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:46,500
So that's, you know, and the red buttons really stand out.

1835
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,820
Don't click that unless you really wanna lose this document.

1836
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:50,700
I like that.

1837
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:55,460
So do you have any kind of sense of where the Kwin project's

1838
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:57,940
coming from and see like that?

1839
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,540
Well, do the server-side decoration thing instead

1840
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:02,220
because you still gotta solve this problem for Exwayland.

1841
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:04,780
I mean, I don't know.

1842
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:09,620
I'm not sure I fully understand the argument against

1843
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:12,900
having client-side decorations, to be honest.

1844
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,140
It kind of seems like you can do everything

1845
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:18,000
you could do with server-side decorations

1846
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,820
with client-side decorations.

1847
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:21,940
I know I see some people saying like,

1848
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:24,340
oh, well, that means that all the apps draw

1849
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:25,740
where their own window positions are

1850
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:26,900
and I don't want my apps to have

1851
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,740
different window button positions.

1852
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,980
That's not really how it works on the GTK side.

1853
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,860
Like it's a widget and you as an app developer

1854
01:03:33,860 --> 01:03:35,860
just use the widget and you pack everything

1855
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:38,180
in between the window decorations.

1856
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:41,800
But GTK itself decides where the buttons go.

1857
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:45,780
So if it was solved in that same way

1858
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,700
with a Qt widget on their side,

1859
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:50,000
like that completely removes that argument too.

1860
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:54,260
Yeah, it does seem solvable on their side.

1861
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,480
In fact, it almost seems like it'd be easier for them

1862
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,680
to support the client-side decoration stuff.

1863
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:01,220
So I teased it a bit.

1864
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:03,100
Do you want to also touch on the switch from CMake

1865
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:04,900
while we have you?

1866
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,100
Yes, that'd be great.

1867
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:09,500
Yeah, cause audio dropped out back there.

1868
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,340
Yeah, no, that's okay.

1869
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:11,160
We'll circle back to this.

1870
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,940
So yeah, tell me about the switch from CMake

1871
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:13,820
and what's that all about?

1872
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:15,840
And what are you switching to?

1873
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:18,700
Yeah, so we're actually really excited about this.

1874
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,060
So we were running, if people don't know,

1875
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:22,660
like CMake is a build system

1876
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:26,120
and a build system is what you use to take your source code

1877
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,860
and turn it into like executable binaries.

1878
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:31,660
So every application has to have a build system

1879
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:33,420
of it has compiled code.

1880
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:35,220
We're using CMake for a long time

1881
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,300
and CMake's pretty good.

1882
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,980
But one of the things we have to do to make CMake work

1883
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:43,020
for all our use cases is we carry like this big set

1884
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:46,620
of modules that helps us do things like internationalization

1885
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,740
or using like G resource

1886
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:52,940
or like all kinds of little plugins like that.

1887
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:54,260
Well, we recently-

1888
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:56,420
So you need to have that sort of hack those on.

1889
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:58,660
Yeah, and so developers kind of have a choice

1890
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:00,880
where they either add a dependency package

1891
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,080
that is only shipped in elementary OS

1892
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:06,100
or they shove all these modules into their upstream project

1893
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:09,740
and try to stay in sync with our module package.

1894
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,840
That's like not a super great experience.

1895
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:17,700
But we've been looking a lot into the Mason build system

1896
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:19,940
because more and more people are adopting it.

1897
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:24,100
It's in system D now, it's in GTK plus.

1898
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:28,520
And so we've talked with their developers upstream

1899
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,480
and we're actually able to get some patches in there

1900
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,900
to solve some issues we had with Bala support

1901
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:37,300
and translations and things like that.

1902
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,820
And they've been super awesome and responsive to us.

1903
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:42,180
And we're totally all in on Mason.

1904
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:45,060
We're migrating all of our projects over to it.

1905
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,100
That's awesome.

1906
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:48,920
Wow.

1907
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:52,980
From like a project standpoint,

1908
01:05:52,980 --> 01:05:56,820
is that like something you guys like have like a powwow on

1909
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,900
or is that like somebody decides on high?

1910
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:01,620
Like what's the structure on making a change like that

1911
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:03,100
in elementary?

1912
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,100
It kind of started off as just like a,

1913
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,580
hey, have you heard of this Mason thing?

1914
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:07,860
Like, oh yeah, I don't know, yeah.

1915
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:11,580
And then like, I think actually it was me

1916
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:14,780
who first used it in one of my little side projects.

1917
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:16,220
And then I showed somebody and I was like,

1918
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,040
hey, check this out.

1919
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,540
And it was like the amount of lines of Mason it took

1920
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:23,000
to build the app was like such this tiny,

1921
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
like neat, nice little file that everybody was like,

1922
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,180
holy crap, I got to look at that, you know?

1923
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:32,180
And so it just kind of spread out from there.

1924
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:33,540
Yeah, and then we're all kind of like,

1925
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:35,740
okay, let's just do this for everything now.

1926
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:37,940
Those are the best guys.

1927
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:38,760
That is great.

1928
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,360
I got to say, I really appreciate that your blog post

1929
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,340
had such an easy example,

1930
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,900
because I've seen a lot of other projects write

1931
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,740
about switching and it's easy to say,

1932
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,300
oh yeah, it's an easier config,

1933
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:48,440
but your example really lays it out.

1934
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,740
Like it's just simpler.

1935
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:50,580
Yeah.

1936
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,420
Yeah, I will link to that.

1937
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:52,240
Thanks, yeah.

1938
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,460
That is a very good point.

1939
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:56,860
I want to now, I want to shift back to,

1940
01:06:56,860 --> 01:06:59,180
let's wrap up this plasma conversation real quick.

1941
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,740
Thank you, Dan, for the insight on that.

1942
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:02,980
I was curious, I've been really getting

1943
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:04,700
the elementary OS itch recently.

1944
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,380
Trying to hold off on the itch before release

1945
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:08,780
just so I don't, but boy do I,

1946
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:11,020
every time you come on here, it gives me the itch.

1947
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:12,380
Or that's the rash, I'm not sure.

1948
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:13,700
But either way, I appreciate it.

1949
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,500
Thank you very much for giving us the update.

1950
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:18,940
So this was sort of, I sort of did this too,

1951
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,980
because Wimpy's like, you need to try out plasma on Wayland

1952
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:24,700
and see what that's like compared to a gnome on Wayland

1953
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,240
if you're having all these troubles.

1954
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,380
And as is typical, Wimpy was right.

1955
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:34,380
And so I tried out KDE Neon, I got the user edition,

1956
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:38,420
and I loaded it on the AirMaster broadcast machine

1957
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:39,400
that's having some issues.

1958
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,660
I loaded it on my laptops,

1959
01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:46,220
and I've been sort of changing my perspective

1960
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:47,500
on plasma desktop.

1961
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,100
I've always liked it initially,

1962
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:51,740
and I tend to sort of trail off,

1963
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:53,700
because I tend to start to get annoyed

1964
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,340
with having to change all of these settings.

1965
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,020
Every time, the first time I launch

1966
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:59,260
any plasma desktop application,

1967
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,260
I just have to go through all these configuration changes.

1968
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,540
Everything, Dolphin, every app on the desktop.

1969
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:04,780
You know, if you have, like this,

1970
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,900
my XPS 13 has a high DPI screen.

1971
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:11,420
I gotta change, I have to go into the display output,

1972
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,520
and I have to scale the display output.

1973
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,760
I have to go into the font settings,

1974
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,540
I have to scale up my fonts.

1975
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:19,780
I have to go down to my panel, I have to resize my panel,

1976
01:08:19,780 --> 01:08:21,180
and I have to go into the mouse settings

1977
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,700
and change my mouse cursor to support high DPI.

1978
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:27,300
So it supports high DPI if I change four different settings

1979
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:28,860
in four completely different locations

1980
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:31,560
in the system settings, then I get high DPI.

1981
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:35,020
After I've done all that, you know, it's nice, it's fine,

1982
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:36,920
it's great, I don't need to change it again.

1983
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,560
That's true for everything, Dolphin, console,

1984
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:40,400
everything's like that.

1985
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,900
Having those knobs are nice on one system

1986
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,540
if you really want it to be just the way you want,

1987
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:44,860
but when you have five systems,

1988
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:46,060
you kind of just want the nice default.

1989
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,380
I was laughing, like I got into a,

1990
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:48,580
I got down into it, and I'm like,

1991
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:51,700
yeah, I'm like configuring how many lines my screen scrolls

1992
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,940
when I move my mouse scroll wheel one notch.

1993
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:55,860
I'm like, this is probably at a level of detail

1994
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:58,220
I don't need to be at anymore.

1995
01:08:58,220 --> 01:08:59,860
So that in the past would piss me off,

1996
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:01,180
like what are these guys doing?

1997
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,940
Why don't they just add some sane defaults?

1998
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:05,020
Why doesn't anybody just add a sane default?

1999
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:06,820
But I'm flipping on that now.

2000
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:08,360
And I have a different perspective

2001
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:11,660
after getting just dumped on by Gnome a lot.

2002
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:13,140
You know, this is an ongoing issue.

2003
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:14,700
It affects our OBS where I get the studio.

2004
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:16,740
It's a constant problem.

2005
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:18,980
And I've come to the realization that

2006
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,660
having to change defaults for six months

2007
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:24,720
is a lot better than having my desktop

2008
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,020
crash on me all the time.

2009
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:27,960
And so if I'm gonna live with one annoyance,

2010
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,700
I'll live with the fact that I can change the defaults,

2011
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,360
and if nothing else, maybe this will finally

2012
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,380
get me off my butt to actually sync

2013
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,080
my configuration amongst my machines.

2014
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,180
I've threatened to do it for years.

2015
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:38,140
You have threatened to do it for years.

2016
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:38,980
You know what I mean?

2017
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:39,800
Yeah, absolutely.

2018
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,640
Every time I get into Plasma,

2019
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,460
I start to threaten it even more,

2020
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:43,540
but now that I'm sitting around West

2021
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:44,420
doing tech snap all the time,

2022
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:45,980
I think I may finally get off my duff

2023
01:09:45,980 --> 01:09:47,100
and sync this config around.

2024
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:48,580
Wes, are you a C file fan?

2025
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,740
You know, I have used it, but I don't use it currently.

2026
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:52,580
Oh, okay.

2027
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:54,260
What do you, are you Dropbox?

2028
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:55,920
Are you a sync thing guy?

2029
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,120
I have a sync thing for some things,

2030
01:09:57,120 --> 01:10:00,340
and then some Chef-based config for other things.

2031
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:02,620
Okay, so what would it take to get you

2032
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:04,900
to try C file for syncing these configs?

2033
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,240
Just some time to do it, I suppose.

2034
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:07,540
Maybe we try it tonight if we get back to studio.

2035
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:10,040
I'm telling you, here's a Noah Redbook prediction

2036
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:10,880
for Chris.

2037
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,380
Once Chris tries C file, he will never go back.

2038
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:17,140
Because here's the thing, and I think,

2039
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:18,620
I feel like I've said this a couple of times

2040
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:21,220
throughout this weekend, but there are projects

2041
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:23,460
that I like because they're open source projects,

2042
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:25,820
and I just think they're really good open source projects,

2043
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:27,960
and then there's good on the level of,

2044
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,660
this is such an amazing product, the license be damned.

2045
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:33,060
It's just a good product,

2046
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:34,540
and that's how I feel about C file.

2047
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:36,980
It's just, it's one of those things I installed.

2048
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:38,140
I haven't looked at C file in ages.

2049
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,740
I installed it one time on one server,

2050
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:43,120
installed the sync client to all of my computers,

2051
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,660
and I change a lot of data.

2052
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:46,740
I've got video files and audio files

2053
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:49,020
and all the source files for this show, or my show.

2054
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:50,940
It integrates with Collabra online server, too.

2055
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:53,060
Yeah, syncs all over the place,

2056
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:57,620
and I never once, not one single time,

2057
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:00,440
have it bite me, and the closest I ever get

2058
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,460
is let's say I leave a file open on one computer

2059
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,460
and I open up on another computer, and I do some really.

2060
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,460
You get a conflict copy?

2061
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:07,900
Yeah, I get a conflict copy, and it timestamps it for me

2062
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:10,260
and says, here, boss, here's all the files you have.

2063
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,300
Which one did you want to actually, amazing.

2064
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,540
So their pricing is based on amount of users,

2065
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:15,380
not amount of storage?

2066
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:17,300
Well, C file is free.

2067
01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:18,940
You can pay for them to host it for you.

2068
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:19,780
Oh, I see, I see.

2069
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,180
But you can also just run it yourself.

2070
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:23,380
If we make it back before 10 p.m. tonight,

2071
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:24,380
we should try to set this up.

2072
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,220
All right.

2073
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,980
Because I gotta try this, because I gotta tell you,

2074
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:30,700
now that I have this plasma, I was going around

2075
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,180
and showing some of the canonical guys, too.

2076
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:34,460
I'm like, let me just show you this, right?

2077
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:35,700
I got a pretty sweet desktop.

2078
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,620
Yeah, yeah, and I'm like, and you know what?

2079
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:40,940
The consensus is, once you get it set up,

2080
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:43,100
these plasma guys really know what they're doing.

2081
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,540
They have built this thing real well,

2082
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:50,460
and it's perhaps better positioned for our Wayland future

2083
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:53,300
than I think.

2084
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,660
It's kind of in the dark horse, right?

2085
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:57,700
We talk about Martin's excellent blog posts here and now,

2086
01:11:57,700 --> 01:11:59,980
but they've just been churning away in the background,

2087
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:01,300
making stuff work.

2088
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:06,300
Yeah, and it sort of strikes me that

2089
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:11,060
it is actually visible just Noah and I

2090
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,140
were sitting in the studio.

2091
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:16,540
We had AirMaster running Unity 7, which is good.

2092
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:18,020
You know, it's pretty performant,

2093
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:19,220
unless it's been running for a week,

2094
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:22,060
but if you reboot and it's been like 48 hours, it's good.

2095
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,300
And we moved.

2096
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:26,060
We just did like a, we just sat there.

2097
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:26,900
We didn't even stand up.

2098
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:27,740
We didn't move.

2099
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:31,460
We just reloaded the machine to KDE Neon with plasma,

2100
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,540
and he and I both look at each other and go,

2101
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:33,780
this is noticeably faster.

2102
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:35,540
This is just, we can just look at the screen

2103
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:36,780
and you can just tell it's noticeably faster.

2104
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:38,380
And that was with the open source driver.

2105
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:39,780
Then we loaded the NVIDIA blob,

2106
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:42,060
and all of a sudden, it's like, snap.

2107
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:45,460
Yeah, and I know it's a fresh install,

2108
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:46,980
but these aren't, we weren't replacing

2109
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:48,620
super complicated installs.

2110
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:49,460
These are pretty minimal.

2111
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:50,620
They're pretty minimal machines, yeah.

2112
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:53,820
Oh my, it's smooth, it's clear, the transparencies.

2113
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:55,340
You know, to illustrate that point,

2114
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:57,060
and you'd have to be there to really understand it,

2115
01:12:57,060 --> 01:13:00,820
but to illustrate that point, the boot time was so fast

2116
01:13:00,820 --> 01:13:02,700
that he thought, he literally thought

2117
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:05,100
we were waiting for the BIOS to post

2118
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:07,740
and then getting to BIOS, and it was actually,

2119
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:10,460
we were waiting for the log on screen to actually show up.

2120
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:15,460
Yeah, and part of it, I think, is I switched out LightDM,

2121
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,020
and I think that makes a difference,

2122
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:20,260
because it doesn't flash as much and all that kind of stuff.

2123
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:21,100
I know I do this.

2124
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,260
I know people that have been listening for a while

2125
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:23,340
know that Chris moves around.

2126
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:24,380
Chris is on that new thing?

2127
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:27,940
Yeah, no, I know, so I'm doing this specifically

2128
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:30,180
to sort of live client-side decorations for a bit,

2129
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:33,220
live the plasma wayland, just get some perspective

2130
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:36,220
on these particular issues that are coming up

2131
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:38,980
and get a feel for it, and so right now,

2132
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:41,900
I'm running here on this XPS 13, plasma,

2133
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:45,620
the current version of plasma for the KDE Neon distribution,

2134
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:50,620
or don't call it a distro, high DPI, Wayland driver,

2135
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:53,580
or using Wayland for display,

2136
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:57,400
and getting great battery life, getting great performance,

2137
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,140
getting noticeably better battery life.

2138
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:01,620
I did all of Koda Radio.

2139
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,060
I never do a show on battery.

2140
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,580
I never do a show on battery.

2141
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:05,420
Well, you're a professional.

2142
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:07,740
Ever, and we got here in the morning.

2143
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:09,320
Koda Radio's at noon.

2144
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,160
I did the whole show.

2145
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:11,100
I did the morning prep.

2146
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:12,980
I did the show all off on battery.

2147
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:13,820
Wow.

2148
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:14,640
And then plugged it in later,

2149
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:16,200
just so that way I wouldn't be inconvenienced later on,

2150
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:20,380
not because I had to, and yeah, I'm just relaying

2151
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:22,420
if this is something that's crossed your mind,

2152
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:25,060
if you've been wondering about where GNOME's going,

2153
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,620
what's gonna happen with GNOME Shell.

2154
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:29,940
I noticed, too, on our GNOME, on Reddit,

2155
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:32,460
there are weekly posts about what's going on

2156
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:33,420
with GNOME Shell's lag.

2157
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:34,540
Why is GNOME so laggy?

2158
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:36,140
There's constant discussion about it.

2159
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:38,280
People are starting to see it more and more,

2160
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:41,460
because there's more people using GNOME than ever before,

2161
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,380
and so more and more people are noticing this stuff,

2162
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:46,900
but you can go to Launchpad and look at the bug tracker

2163
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,780
for 17.10, and look at all the stuff on there

2164
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:53,500
for Wayland and GNOME 3, and see that there's,

2165
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,880
I could be wrong on this,

2166
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,940
because I haven't looked for a month,

2167
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:00,500
but I think they're getting more bugs related to Wayland

2168
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,340
than they've ever gotten on anything.

2169
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,340
Wow.

2170
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:06,900
Yeah, it's not even an LTS release.

2171
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:07,960
I'd have to recheck the numbers,

2172
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:11,180
because this was when 17.10 was kind of new,

2173
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:13,360
but that's not a good sign.

2174
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,380
So this has all given me pause recently,

2175
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:17,220
and it's something that I've been talking to you guys

2176
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:19,900
about behind the scenes, like I am really worried

2177
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:23,600
that we are barreling down the GNOME 3 highway,

2178
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,660
Canonical's shipping it, which means Dell is shipping it,

2179
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:29,380
System76 is basing Pop!OS off of it,

2180
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:32,060
CentOS and Red Hat are selling to corporate customers

2181
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:35,580
on GNOME 3, and the more and more esoteric edge cases

2182
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,180
that we bring into the fold,

2183
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:39,780
and the more desktop use cases that we bring into the fold,

2184
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:41,980
and the more pressure we're putting on Wayland,

2185
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:44,500
the more cracks we're seeing, not necessarily in Wayland,

2186
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,500
because Wayland is a protocol.

2187
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,080
It is all of the software that's attempted

2188
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,500
to write their own implementations.

2189
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,340
Yes, exactly.

2190
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:53,080
Yeah, and it's fundamentally bringing up

2191
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,580
architectural issues that we've been able to punt for years

2192
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:59,500
because X helped cover it up, or XYZ helped cover it up.

2193
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:02,580
Or no one was really using anything that used Wayland yet.

2194
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:04,620
And so when you see projects like elementary OS

2195
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:05,580
that have their own desktop,

2196
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:08,620
or Solus that have their own desktop,

2197
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:11,020
you go, oh, that's sort of why they did that.

2198
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:14,140
That's sort of why they, they must've been hip to this.

2199
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:15,540
They didn't wanna say anything.

2200
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:17,580
You know, it's not cool to publicly shit

2201
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,060
on another open source project,

2202
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:21,120
but behind the scenes they go,

2203
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:22,300
people are gonna get hip to this,

2204
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:23,920
and we've gotta come up with something else.

2205
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,260
And the Plasma project, to their credit,

2206
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:27,980
has been, since the 5 release,

2207
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:29,900
has been working at this problem,

2208
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,660
and making their architecture sound,

2209
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:34,940
and cleaning their house for release after release

2210
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:37,820
after release, they're now getting into the feature,

2211
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:39,500
you know, they're now getting into piling

2212
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,460
the features back on.

2213
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:41,300
Yes.

2214
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,180
Which, that'll be interesting to see how that goes,

2215
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,500
because it's been a lot about refinement,

2216
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:46,960
and now Plasma feels like, like 5.13,

2217
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:48,380
man, they're adding some cool stuff.

2218
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:50,420
Like, you're gonna have full Chrome integration

2219
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:52,500
with notifications, so like, downloads in Chrome

2220
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,980
will show up in the Plasma notifications.

2221
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:54,980
Oh, just write in the native notifications?

2222
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:55,820
Oh, wow.

2223
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:56,640
You're watching a YouTube video,

2224
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,500
you can click the volume icon on the Plasma desktop,

2225
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:00,380
you can pause the YouTube video.

2226
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:01,220
Ah, yes.

2227
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:02,540
Yeah, like, we're talking like,

2228
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:04,480
nice features are coming.

2229
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,320
They just recently.

2230
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,160
These are like Windows level features.

2231
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,140
Yeah, they just recently introduced the vol,

2232
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:10,220
like, things are good, like, it's good stuff,

2233
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,660
and they're doing a good job of it.

2234
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:14,580
But they have sort of crossed that threshold

2235
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:16,940
of refinement, refinement, refinement,

2236
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:19,240
to let's try doing this now, let's add this.

2237
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:22,000
So now they're going down Uncharted Territory 2,

2238
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,980
but they do seem to have a better foundation.

2239
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:26,400
So how long did it take for you

2240
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,340
to get that up and running, customized,

2241
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:29,740
and to a way that you could use it?

2242
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:30,580
That's a good question.

2243
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,520
Being deep in Gnomeland, which has a pretty easy

2244
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,540
and, like, well-defined normal.

2245
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:34,380
Two days.

2246
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:35,860
If I could interject, if I could interject,

2247
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:38,020
as far as how long did it take him to use it,

2248
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:41,940
zero, he used it fresh, because he, you installed,

2249
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,400
I think you installed some programs,

2250
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,340
like, to get Telegram and stuff,

2251
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:47,060
but you had to do, we didn't have time to customize it.

2252
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:48,460
So he did show prep.

2253
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:50,740
He did the first, the first day he used it, stock.

2254
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:51,660
Just stock, yeah, okay.

2255
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:52,740
And then you started tweaking it.

2256
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:55,020
Yeah, and, you know, in all of the installs,

2257
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:59,320
I also timed how long it took, roughly timed,

2258
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:00,940
not, like, super anal about it,

2259
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:03,280
but roughly timed how long it took

2260
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:05,140
before I had to install GTK apps

2261
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:05,980
and a bunch of GTK dependencies.

2262
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:08,060
Yes, right, oh yeah, that's another factor.

2263
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:11,120
It's about, on average, about 15 minutes.

2264
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:14,720
Oh, oh, because sometimes I just don't know,

2265
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:15,780
like, I want a gdebi.

2266
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:17,460
If I'm on an Ubuntu system, I want gdebi.

2267
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:18,300
It's my favorite.

2268
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:21,740
Turns out there's, like, essentially a cute Debi alternative,

2269
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,740
right, but I didn't know that, I didn't remember.

2270
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,660
Takes time to find those alternatives, yeah.

2271
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:28,520
But sure enough, so one of the things I've done, Wes,

2272
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:31,140
is I've gone, only you can see this,

2273
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:34,540
so I'm gonna just tell you, is I've just gone with,

2274
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:35,580
I've got a lot of windows open.

2275
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:38,460
I've just gone with a really simple one bar at the bottom,

2276
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:40,540
just a couple of applets here, the clock,

2277
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:42,340
my task launcher, my virtual desktop.

2278
01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:44,460
Pretty simple, pretty traditional desktop setup.

2279
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:46,620
Yeah, so I'm not going with, like, lots of plasmoids.

2280
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:48,780
I'm not doing, you know, I don't have menu meters

2281
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:50,900
all over the place, and, you know, stats,

2282
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:53,740
and big slideshows on my desktop like I've done in the past.

2283
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:56,740
It's just minimal plasma setup, keep it nice,

2284
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:57,860
did a dark theme.

2285
01:18:57,860 --> 01:18:58,700
Yeah, it's handsome.

2286
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,220
I actually installed ArcDark.

2287
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:04,540
And then I went and set ArcDark on the GTK stuff,

2288
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,000
because they have, in the plasma settings,

2289
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,740
you can go in there and set your GTK appearance settings.

2290
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,060
They make it really easy, actually, yeah.

2291
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:12,700
Yeah, yeah, it looks better than it did under Unity 7.

2292
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:14,860
So I'll show you right here, you know.

2293
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:17,380
So when you're in the studio and the machines are rebooted,

2294
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:19,460
as you know, oh, this doesn't have, this is Intel.

2295
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,340
But as you know, in the studio on AirMaster,

2296
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,980
when we reboot, you have to launch the NVIDIA control panel.

2297
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:25,540
Go reset up all your settings.

2298
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:27,280
Right, so that way the capture cards work

2299
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,200
and get all the refresh rates right.

2300
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,780
And it is a bright white GTK application

2301
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,800
that doesn't match the desktop theme at all,

2302
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,260
because it's being run as pseudo or root or whatever.

2303
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:39,800
Sure enough, with Plasma Desktop,

2304
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:43,500
when you set GTK appearances and you say prefer dark themes,

2305
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,280
every GTK app, it fits.

2306
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:47,460
So I actually have my GTK apps, because I'm

2307
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:52,460
using ArcDark in Plasma, and I have my GTK app set to ArcDark,

2308
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:54,660
I can open these apps side by side.

2309
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:56,340
And you just get one consistent.

2310
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:58,220
If you took out Sherlock's magnifying glass,

2311
01:19:58,220 --> 01:19:59,860
you could find inconsistencies.

2312
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:03,820
Like the OK button on a Qt app is a different shape slightly

2313
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:05,500
than the GTK version.

2314
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,580
But it's the same shading, it's the same theme,

2315
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:11,340
it's the same color, it's the same title bar,

2316
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,820
because I'm not using client-side decorations.

2317
01:20:13,820 --> 01:20:18,060
And I opened that, I went, look at this, Noah, look at this.

2318
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:20,020
You can't even tell this is a GTK application.

2319
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:22,580
If I was an average user, I would be completely oblivious

2320
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:24,980
that there was two different toolkits on my screen.

2321
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:27,700
And that was really nice, because it sort of gave me

2322
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:30,020
permission to use a couple of GTK apps

2323
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:31,380
and not feel like I'm paying a penalty.

2324
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:32,900
You don't have to bend the world to jump into this new place.

2325
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:34,360
You can just use the software you want.

2326
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:34,940
Yep.

2327
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:36,260
So that's where I'm at.

2328
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:40,340
Plus, you combine that with Firefox has a breeze theme,

2329
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:41,860
a breeze dark theme that you can install

2330
01:20:41,860 --> 01:20:45,540
that kind of makes it look nice on the Plasma desktop.

2331
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:48,100
Oh, while we're talking about it,

2332
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:51,580
the other thing I did this install around is no Chrome.

2333
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:53,500
Just not even installing Chrome at all.

2334
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:55,460
I'm just going all in on Firefox.

2335
01:20:55,460 --> 01:20:57,620
And Firefox already has some of that integration

2336
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,560
with the Plasma desktop I was talking about for Chrome.

2337
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:01,100
Firefox already got some of that.

2338
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:03,340
So you get that stuff today with the current version

2339
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:05,580
of Firefox on the current version of the Plasma desktop.

2340
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:06,580
This is a whole new Chris.

2341
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:07,980
No longer gnome in Chrome.

2342
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:08,660
I know.

2343
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:09,620
I know.

2344
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:10,660
I know it's weird.

2345
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:14,180
I know, meanwhile, Noah's over there installing Windows.

2346
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:14,900
Not really.

2347
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:15,580
You know what's funny?

2348
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,180
You really have to be careful.

2349
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:19,820
So I still, to this day, dude, I still

2350
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:21,980
get telegrams and emails going, dude,

2351
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:23,300
how's FreeBSD working out for you?

2352
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:24,860
Oh, yeah, from that April Fool's.

2353
01:21:24,860 --> 01:21:27,100
The whole episode, we talked about how it was a joke.

2354
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:28,620
At the end, we talked about how it was a joke.

2355
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:30,900
And there are still people that are like,

2356
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:33,620
I talked about it one time for like 15 minutes.

2357
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:36,340
And people are like, oh, yeah, he's a BSD guy now.

2358
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:38,820
You're going to actually think I'm installing Windows.

2359
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:41,100
I do have a backup plan, as JJ asked.

2360
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,700
My backup plan, if for some reason

2361
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:46,020
the Firefoxing doesn't work out, is to maybe go with Vivaldi.

2362
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:48,820
I've been hearing a lot of people talk good stuff.

2363
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:52,220
So right before I wiped my boxes, one of them

2364
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:54,300
I put out in Vivaldi.

2365
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,100
It is great.

2366
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:57,260
Vivaldi, it is slick.

2367
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:58,740
It feels faster than regular Chrome.

2368
01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:00,380
I love the way it shows loading stuff.

2369
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:02,300
If you're on Linux and you want a browser that

2370
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:05,060
feels like it's turned up to 11 a little bit,

2371
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:06,820
Vivaldi is pretty good.

2372
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:08,700
And they just implemented sync support.

2373
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,460
They're getting bigger, I think.

2374
01:22:10,460 --> 01:22:12,580
A lot of people are telling me Vivaldi.

2375
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:14,820
Have you tried Brave?

2376
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:15,460
No.

2377
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:16,540
Joe likes Brave.

2378
01:22:16,540 --> 01:22:18,060
He's talked to me a little bit about Brave.

2379
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:18,780
I haven't tried it myself.

2380
01:22:18,780 --> 01:22:20,060
It seems like both have gotten some good buzz.

2381
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:20,420
Yeah.

2382
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:22,140
Now, Brave's on the desktop too, right?

2383
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:23,640
Because I think it's available as one

2384
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,300
of the universal packages.

2385
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:26,380
Yeah.

2386
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:28,940
Bashful makes a good point about Netflix.

2387
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:31,540
Actually, no, I watched Netflix in the new Firefox.

2388
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:32,300
That's happened.

2389
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:33,220
I've done that.

2390
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:34,220
I've been there.

2391
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:37,500
I specifically watched 35 Seconds of Star Trek Deep Space

2392
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,660
9 in Firefox just to verify that it worked.

2393
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:41,140
And then I was like, OK, good enough.

2394
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:42,380
I don't have time right now.

2395
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:44,900
Anyways, I should probably move on.

2396
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:50,860
But I guess this Snap event, having

2397
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:54,900
seen people here that really know their stuff talking

2398
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:58,020
about architectural issues that they're not sure how to solve,

2399
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:01,620
that they're not even sure they have the leverage upstream

2400
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:03,540
to have upstream work with them to solve.

2401
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:04,040
Yeah.

2402
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:06,520
It sort of underscored some stressing

2403
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,720
that I've been doing about the future of Gnome.

2404
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:11,480
When Canonical announced that they were switching to Gnome,

2405
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:12,960
I was pretty excited that we were

2406
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,240
going to have as the same, what is it, a lot of wood

2407
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,280
behind a single arrow?

2408
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:16,440
Yeah.

2409
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,480
Because that's not something we commonly have in open source.

2410
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,680
I think that's something these corporate people would say.

2411
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:22,360
And I thought, great.

2412
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,480
This is a great opportunity.

2413
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:24,720
Right, once we have some focus.

2414
01:23:24,720 --> 01:23:25,480
Right.

2415
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:28,080
But what really has given me tremendous pause,

2416
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,480
and maybe this is wrong, I hope.

2417
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,480
I hope, and somebody can correct me if I'm wrong,

2418
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:34,080
but what's giving me tremendous pause as I looked into it

2419
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:37,000
before this show, at least according to the Gnome wikis,

2420
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,240
is they haven't even decided if they're

2421
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,800
going to address these architectural issues.

2422
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:44,280
Wow.

2423
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:47,640
That to me is, that just gives me a moment of pause.

2424
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,080
When they're like, yeah, I mean, we

2425
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:50,920
don't want to break extensions, but we also

2426
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,800
don't like desktops crashing.

2427
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,240
Seems like too totally, the thing is, too,

2428
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:57,040
and the things I find slightly unforgivable,

2429
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:59,680
and I'll leave it at this, is, yeah,

2430
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,680
I'll leave it at this, is it's not

2431
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:08,200
like multiprocessor architecture was a new concept when

2432
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,000
Gnome Shell came around.

2433
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,120
Gnome Shell is a relatively new piece of software,

2434
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,960
and the problems that they failed to solve

2435
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,840
were well understood at that point.

2436
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:22,280
They made a conscious decision to architect Gnome like this,

2437
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:24,080
maybe to cut corners, I'm just assuming.

2438
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:27,520
I don't know why you would design a modern desktop

2439
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,160
environment like this.

2440
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:32,280
But they did, they made that choice.

2441
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:35,880
And now, they seem to be almost willing to repeat

2442
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,560
the mistake again.

2443
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:40,040
And the worst thing about it is, this is my last point,

2444
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:44,400
and really, we are so screwed either way.

2445
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,300
If they don't fix the problem, then we

2446
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:49,120
have a joke of a primary platform for our desktop

2447
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:53,160
environment, because it's as bad as classic Mac OS

2448
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,360
at this point.

2449
01:24:54,360 --> 01:24:57,320
And if they do solve it, they're throwing out

2450
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:00,200
all of this established momentum behind Gnome 3,

2451
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:03,040
right as all of this wood is behind the arrow,

2452
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:06,360
and it's the perfect time to seize the developer, DevOps,

2453
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:09,760
SysOps market, except for, once again, we're

2454
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,320
going to reboot our desktop environment.

2455
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,760
I would submit to you that we are far more screwed if they

2456
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,920
decide not to fix the problem.

2457
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,880
I really think, because I really think,

2458
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,180
even if everyone comes onto Linux, and I agree,

2459
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:23,760
it's a really terrible time, for like the third time in a row,

2460
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,800
so it's like we have a habit of really terrible timing.

2461
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:26,600
Yes, we do.

2462
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:29,480
But at least there is light at the end of the tunnel,

2463
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:32,880
because right now, you're going to have a bunch of people

2464
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,600
coming over, and Gnome 3 is not great to begin with.

2465
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,400
I love it.

2466
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,080
No, no, no.

2467
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,720
As far as if you sit down at stock Gnome 3, it's not great.

2468
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:40,880
Oh, yeah, yeah.

2469
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,840
I've got to at least put minimize and maximize back on.

2470
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:44,080
And you know how to do that, a lot of people.

2471
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,920
And so we're already starting behind the curve,

2472
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,360
and now we're going to add to the fact that at some point

2473
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:51,360
in the distant future, either we're

2474
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,560
going to deal with a crappy desktop for a little bit,

2475
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:55,400
or a desktop with a huge problem,

2476
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,800
or we're going to have to reboot it somewhere down the road

2477
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,040
after everyone's already switched.

2478
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:01,960
Those are not good options to me.

2479
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,840
I would have Dan chime in, but I know we've got to move on,

2480
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,920
because I didn't want this to be a Gnome bashing thing,

2481
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:07,240
because I love the Gnome project.

2482
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,600
I love the Gnome desktop, but Dan makes a good point

2483
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,120
in the Discord chat room that this is really

2484
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:15,040
kind of a consequence in a way of designing for Wayland

2485
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,360
and trying to either have this IPC system that

2486
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:20,320
is secure and safe, versus just not even bothering

2487
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:21,720
with that particular problem.

2488
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,240
And I can completely understand that.

2489
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,480
So either way, and you know what,

2490
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:27,880
I'm still very appreciative of the hard work they have done,

2491
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,000
even if we're at this point.

2492
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,360
I do really appreciate it.

2493
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:33,080
And when it's working right, nothing

2494
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:34,320
sings to me like Gnome 3 does.

2495
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,080
It's really great.

2496
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,440
So I'll leave it at that for now.

2497
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:38,520
But if you've been thinking about that,

2498
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,480
I'd say go give KDE Neon a try.

2499
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,720
It's a pretty great way to get your hands on KDE Neon.

2500
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:43,960
And it's one of the strengths, right?

2501
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,920
It's a part of the open source Linux community.

2502
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,880
We do have options, and it's worth our time

2503
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,000
to explore those and take advantage.

2504
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,560
Speaking of those options, let's wrap this up

2505
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:53,320
on one of the favorite applications

2506
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:56,320
I came on when I was using Gnome.

2507
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,920
I was looking for client-side decorated apps,

2508
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,640
and I came across Tilex.

2509
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:02,200
Tilex?

2510
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:03,840
It's a replacement for Gnome Terminal.

2511
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,480
OK, I thought this was like a shower cleaning tool.

2512
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,200
I know, right?

2513
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:07,480
It's a pod that you can eat.

2514
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:08,640
Oh, yeah.

2515
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,920
I was like, how is Gnome Terminal not client-side

2516
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:12,440
decorated?

2517
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:13,440
Like, what is going on?

2518
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,400
This is their terminal.

2519
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,040
Yeah, so I wanted to find one that was,

2520
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:17,280
and I came across Tilex.

2521
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,320
And as the name kind of implies, it's

2522
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:22,840
a Tiling Terminal emulator that follows the Gnome head.

2523
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,520
It uses client-side decorations.

2524
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:27,720
And it lets you split it into multiple,

2525
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,880
like vertical, horizontal panels.

2526
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,000
You can synchronize input across all of them.

2527
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
It supports persistent layout.

2528
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,280
It has very good transparency support,

2529
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:38,160
unlike the regular Gnome Terminal.

2530
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:40,240
Drag and drop support, notifications

2531
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:43,560
that can actually go into the Gnome notifications area,

2532
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:44,920
custom links, which are nice.

2533
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:47,480
You can click on hyperlinks and add custom terminal hyperlinks

2534
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:48,800
to open things in your terminal.

2535
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:53,760
And you can layer the panes, if you will, the west panes.

2536
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,280
You can put them in any arrangement

2537
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,640
that you really like.

2538
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:00,840
And so what I did is I also combined that

2539
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:03,160
with an extension for Gnome Shell that

2540
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:05,640
allowed me to always open up applications

2541
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,240
on a certain virtual desktop.

2542
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:10,080
So Tilex always opens up on virtual desktop 3,

2543
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:10,880
for example.

2544
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,400
That's your terminal desktop.

2545
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:15,680
Slack and Telegram on desktop 2, and they're

2546
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:16,720
tiled next to each other.

2547
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:17,440
That's awesome.

2548
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:20,120
Yeah, and so it was a nice workflow

2549
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,760
when you combine that extension.

2550
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,960
So I always knew my terminal was always here.

2551
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,040
Everything in its right place.

2552
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,560
Yeah, I always have Guake I can go to for a quick install.

2553
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:30,400
But when it's time to sit down and live

2554
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:33,040
in the shell for 20 minutes or something like that,

2555
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,280
or I want to kick off a job and just check in on it

2556
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:37,760
with a quick virtual desktop dropdown, this was it.

2557
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,800
Tilex, you can find a link in the show notes

2558
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,680
because the URL is sort of crazy.

2559
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:45,600
But you can also just Google T-I-L-I-X, the advanced GTK3

2560
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,240
tiling terminal emulator that has client-side decorations,

2561
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,920
which is really what I was just trying to all in on CSDs

2562
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:52,520
if I could.

2563
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:56,040
It's also kind of nice that it feels sort of modern,

2564
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,520
and I feel like a lot of times terminal emulators feel

2565
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:01,320
like somehow Mac still has one of the best ones,

2566
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:03,200
yet we are the terminal people.

2567
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,040
So that's nice, too.

2568
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,440
Somebody could tell this project about the good word

2569
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:07,940
of universal package formats, though,

2570
01:29:07,940 --> 01:29:13,400
because they literally have packages for Antigros, ASIC OS.

2571
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:16,080
I don't even know, Arch Linux, CentOS, 7.3, Debian, Fedora,

2572
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:19,120
OpenSUSE, Ubuntu, and then they just make a targes available

2573
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:23,240
if you just want to pull it down in old school.

2574
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:24,080
I love it, though.

2575
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,520
Of course, it's open source.

2576
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:27,040
They have it up on GitHub.

2577
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,560
And you can also find it on the hashtag,

2578
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:32,920
hashtag Termex in the IRC free note.

2579
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:33,760
Well, you know what?

2580
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:35,480
I'll be installing later today.

2581
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:36,720
Yeah, that is pretty cool.

2582
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:41,320
And it kind of makes me miss Nome a little bit,

2583
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:42,280
kind of makes me does.

2584
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,440
Console is pretty solid, too.

2585
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,920
Console supports some of the stuff, just out of the box.

2586
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:48,040
I'm just saying.

2587
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:49,040
All right, well, that's going to bring us

2588
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,040
to the end of this program, because we

2589
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:50,880
got to get the heck out of here.

2590
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,480
So that way, the Ask Noah show continues on.

2591
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:53,960
So if you're joining live, don't go anywhere,

2592
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:56,280
because the fun, you just got through the first part

2593
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:57,200
of the sandwich, really.

2594
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:59,680
And now there is the other half of the sandwich

2595
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:01,400
and some homemade potato chips.

2596
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:02,600
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

2597
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:03,880
There's a nice aioli on there.

2598
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,200
Oh, yeah, maybe a little chipotle aioli,

2599
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,560
a little brownberry aioli, that's on there, too.

2600
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,840
So go get more Wes Payne.

2601
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,440
He's at Wes Payne on the Twitters.

2602
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:12,000
That's right.

2603
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,800
And TechSnap.Systems, for our other program,

2604
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,520
covered all kinds of stuff, including some meltdown

2605
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:18,840
and specter issues.

2606
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:20,840
And like we said earlier, Kubernetes,

2607
01:30:20,840 --> 01:30:25,160
you can get some more Noah in your face at asknoahshow.com.

2608
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,480
That's Noah's main landing page.

2609
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:29,000
I think he has a Twitter account.

2610
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,400
It's at ChrisLES, I think.

2611
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:30,920
That's right.

2612
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:31,560
Yes, it is.

2613
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:33,800
Stealing my Twitter.

2614
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:36,560
At criticalinuxtheshow, at AskNoahShow.

2615
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,400
The AskNoah dashboard, asknoahshow.com.

2616
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,120
I said that part.

2617
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:39,640
Oh, did you?

2618
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:40,160
Oh, sorry.

2619
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:41,240
No, I said mine.

2620
01:30:41,240 --> 01:30:43,360
Once you get me started, I'm like, you know, I just.

2621
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,040
You're good.

2622
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:48,320
And sure enough, if Noah didn't pull off a live broadcast

2623
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,360
from the car on the drive down here yesterday,

2624
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:53,680
he did a live, he did like a 15, 20 minute live show

2625
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:56,160
from the car on the drive down here.

2626
01:30:56,160 --> 01:30:59,160
So yeah, that piece of gear he brought with him is pretty.

2627
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:00,600
Only because you said I couldn't.

2628
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:01,560
Yeah, exactly.

2629
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:03,680
It seems like we just strapped that right to his back.

2630
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,320
He can walk around, just be on air all the time.

2631
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:06,080
Just give him time.

2632
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,520
It'll probably happen.

2633
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,360
The whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

2634
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,240
You can join us live, jplive.tv, jupiterbroadcasting.com

2635
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:14,360
slash calendar for the live time.

2636
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:16,880
And last but not least, linuxunplugged.reddit.com

2637
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:20,400
and jupiterbroadcasting.com slash contact for all the ways

2638
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,680
to get a hold of us.

2639
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:22,800
We'll be back next week.

2640
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:23,720
Thanks for joining us.

2641
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:41,400
I'll see you next Tuesday.

2642
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,440
How to contain the code, know his magic box.

2643
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:49,360
Containing the future?

2644
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:49,860
No.

2645
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:54,420
Oh, that's kind of, I don't know, I wouldn't click that.

2646
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:57,980
Future is a snap.

2647
01:31:57,980 --> 01:32:00,220
A pod you can eat.

2648
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:03,340
Crafting of snaps.

2649
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:05,100
Hey, I'm not at the studio, and I just

2650
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:06,540
want to make sure that this is actually going to work.

2651
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:08,620
So can you just say hi to me and just make sure

2652
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:11,620
that this is working, Sarah?

2653
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:12,700
Hi, yeah, I can hear you.

2654
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:13,300
Thank you.

2655
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:14,340
Yeah, OK, thank you.

2656
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:16,780
Yep.

2657
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:18,180
Do, do, do, do, do.

2658
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:19,780
Live from locations.

2659
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:21,620
This is a pretty crazy setup we have.

2660
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:22,540
You're talking with Sarah.

2661
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:23,820
We're talking about Mumble Room.

2662
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:26,220
Those people in the Mumble Room are literally all over the world,

2663
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:28,780
and we're sitting here in Seattle in a hotel room right now.

2664
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:31,940
And there's like, what, at best, a 2, 3, 4, 15 millisecond,

2665
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:33,460
30 millisecond delay between us?

2666
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:34,060
Wild.

2667
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:34,940
Remarkable.

2668
01:32:34,940 --> 01:32:35,900
And none of us are using a phone.

2669
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:37,740
Well, Sarah is probably using a phone.

2670
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:39,860
Yeah, so one of us is even on a phone.

2671
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:41,980
That's crazy.

2672
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:43,100
That is amazing, really.

2673
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:44,500
Confluence of technology.

2674
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:45,860
All right, the only thing we can't do

2675
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:46,820
is pick a title, apparently.

2676
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:48,220
So we've got to do that, because the Ask No Shows

2677
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:50,260
are the ones we're worst at.

2678
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:51,940
There's also stuff going on in Discord.

2679
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:54,260
Now that he has his own show, isn't that interesting?

2680
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:55,420
Now that you've got your own show,

2681
01:32:55,420 --> 01:32:56,860
you turn around on the title thing.

2682
01:32:56,860 --> 01:32:58,020
Let's see how it is.

2683
01:32:58,020 --> 01:32:58,500
I see it.

2684
01:32:58,500 --> 01:32:59,300
You giving me shit?

2685
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:01,940
45 episodes in, and I still didn't care about titles.

2686
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:03,900
And it wasn't until you were like, here's what happened,

2687
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:05,940
because he's really good at this.

2688
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:06,460
Great.

2689
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:07,500
I know it's going to be bad.

2690
01:33:07,500 --> 01:33:08,660
No, he's really good at this.

2691
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:11,780
So he knows if he just comes out and says, you're an idiot,

2692
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:14,540
you should do this, I'll be like, I'm not an idiot.

2693
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:15,300
Let me show you why.

2694
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:17,620
I'm never going to do that ever again.

2695
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:18,980
And he uses that in the opposite way, too.

2696
01:33:18,980 --> 01:33:19,980
You can't do a live broadcast.

2697
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:20,780
We do a live broadcast.

2698
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:22,300
You won't be able to do that.

2699
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:26,220
So he tells me, I give him this idea, I'm bouncing it off,

2700
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:28,860
and he answers all of my questions exactly how he has.

2701
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:30,620
And doesn't say, don't do that, do this.

2702
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:32,540
Answers all of them just exactly the way.

2703
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:36,140
Two hours go by, then I get a message.

2704
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:42,500
Hey, I say this with love, but I just want you to consider,

2705
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:46,900
you could do all of that work, or you could pay some attention

2706
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:48,500
to titles.

2707
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,260
And description.

2708
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:50,220
And description.

2709
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:52,220
And it would make a really big difference.

2710
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:53,460
And you could just try it, just see,

2711
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:55,260
that's just a thought for you or whatever.

2712
01:33:55,260 --> 01:33:57,660
And what's funny is, see, my mind, he knows how my mind works.

2713
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:59,020
And this just floats in over Telegram, right?

2714
01:33:59,020 --> 01:33:59,940
So you can see this friendly message.

2715
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:02,060
And the thing is, I'm sure this is planned in his mind.

2716
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:03,620
In my mind, I'm just like, oh, that

2717
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:04,580
was a nice little follow-up.

2718
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:05,940
Yeah, that's a really great idea.

2719
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:08,580
And then when I go back and read it, I'm like, wait a minute.

2720
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:10,660
Well, I mean, it's your call.

2721
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:11,580
I'm not like, yeah.

2722
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:13,300
No, but so anyway, so then I did.

2723
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:15,500
And sure enough, you start looking at the download numbers

2724
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:17,020
when you actually pay attention to the title, turns out

2725
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:17,780
it really matters.

2726
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:20,160
The guy that's been podcasting for 15 years

2727
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,500
actually knows something about podcasting.

2728
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:23,500
Pretty darn smart.

2729
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:24,540
Oh, well.

2730
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:26,020
Damn you, Chris.

2731
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:29,100
The check is in, or the bill is in the mail, Noah.

2732
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:30,380
Sprint, snap, and core.

2733
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:31,580
Here's what I came up with.

2734
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:34,420
I came up with peeking at canonical

2735
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:35,940
and behind canonical's curtain.

2736
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:37,300
I kind of like behind canonical's curtain.

2737
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:38,060
Yeah, that's nice.

2738
01:34:38,060 --> 01:34:39,180
It's got a ring to it.

2739
01:34:39,180 --> 01:34:39,580
OK.

2740
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:40,740
We should probably just go with that,

2741
01:34:40,740 --> 01:34:42,540
so that way we can get out of here fast, Noah.

2742
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:43,860
But thank you guys for helping.

2743
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:44,660
Because I did face-hustle.

2744
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:46,100
If people aren't interested in canonical,

2745
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:47,860
then they probably aren't interested in this episode.

2746
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:48,900
That's a good point.

2747
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:49,940
That's a good point.

2748
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:51,500
Mac OS Terminal is the worst.

2749
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:52,000
I agree.

2750
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,300
I guess it doesn't have Plasma or Gnome in it.

2751
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:54,220
That's the only thing.

2752
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:57,220
But also, it's not that, like, we talk about that all the time.

2753
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:59,180
Yeah, we literally do.

2754
01:34:59,180 --> 01:35:01,060
I almost didn't even want to mention the fact

2755
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:02,300
that I'd move back to Plasma because I'm like,

2756
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:04,300
geez, people have got to be sick and tired of this.

2757
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:05,780
But you're all over the place, Waffler.

2758
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:06,260
I know.

2759
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:07,780
Well, I really thought, the only reason,

2760
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:08,820
I thought I was moved in.

2761
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:10,380
I thought I'd moved into Unity.

2762
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:12,700
You know, I set up my lights outside.

2763
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:14,420
I got my rugs down.

2764
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:15,740
I got my couches moved in.

2765
01:35:15,740 --> 01:35:17,180
I put my big screen TV up.

2766
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:18,660
I thought I was set.

2767
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:21,380
And then I realized that my neighbors were assholes

2768
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:23,820
and that my foundation was leaking and that my roof sucks.

2769
01:35:23,820 --> 01:35:25,700
