1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
So I have something that I thought we'd share.

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,800
We kind of teased this last week,

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,280
but it's official this week.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,040
Fedora has turned 15.

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,040
On November 6, 2003, Red Hat announced Fedora Core 1,

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,480
which people are still upset about,

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,480
the whole core split thing,

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,980
but that's a huge milestone, 15 years.

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,360
Wes and I were just down at the Portland Linux Users Group,

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,880
and I kid you not, there are people that are still upset

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,360
that Red Hat split Fedora off into its own thing,

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,200
because they were like,

13
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,760
they were building their own Red Hat desktop for a while.

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,600
Isn't that wild?

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,160
I know, I thought we'd all moved past it.

16
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,200
I mean, Fedora's kind of become its own thing now, right?

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,400
It stands alone.

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,280
It's great now.

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,160
It is great now.

20
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,400
We're getting it back though, Fedora Core OS.

21
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,240
Oh yeah.

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,060
That's true.

23
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,900
Yeah, we're getting the core back.

24
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,940
Yeah, I like that.

25
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,820
That makes it feel retro.

26
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,680
But I think Noah might've been one of those guys once

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,100
that was a little upset that they went the core route,

28
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,280
they went the Fedora core route

29
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,920
and broke it off from main Red Hat.

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,960
Were you one of those guys?

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,320
I don't know if I was upset about it.

32
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,600
I didn't entirely understand it at first,

33
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,080
after speaking with some of the folks from Red Hat,

34
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,680
I think I got behind it pretty quickly.

35
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,800
Yeah, you can kind of see where they were going at the time.

36
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,720
And now you see how Fedora sort of fits into the life cycle

37
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,000
of even Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,240
But back then it was like,

39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,960
are they abandoning the desktop?

40
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,200
What's happening?

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,560
And here we are 15 years later,

42
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,080
and it kind of makes sense now.

43
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,080
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 274.

44
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,160
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

45
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,240
that's live from all over the world.

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,080
My name is Chris.

47
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,040
My name is Wes.

48
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,520
Hello, Mr. Payne.

49
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,120
We have a great show.

50
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,600
I want to tell everybody about a little bit

51
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,280
about travel adventures, but then really,

52
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,200
we're going to get into some community news,

53
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,880
including some new software,

54
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,560
a couple of things that have gotten a lot of attention

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,120
in the community and some really great news

56
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,480
for anyone who uses a Fuse file system.

57
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,600
Anything that's in that user land file system category,

58
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,400
I've got great news for you.

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,960
And then we'll open it up to the virtual lug.

60
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,720
Is the open source revolution over?

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,400
And maybe we won a couple of points there

62
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,680
and some looking forward conversations

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,040
in that section of the show.

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,640
And then towards the end of the show,

65
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,560
I am so excited to talk about an open source project

66
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,600
that we have begun using at Jupiter Broadcasting

67
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,320
to automate many tasks.

68
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,920
And it's very close to a, but more powerful clone

69
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,560
of if this, then that type service

70
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,520
that you can self-host and you can build

71
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,400
all kinds of neat event-based things around.

72
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,880
And we'll tell you how we're using it.

73
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,800
Maybe give you a few ideas how you could use it

74
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,160
and talk about the project.

75
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,600
And then of course, maybe we'll have a few suggestions

76
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,360
from the virtual lug on alternatives that we could try.

77
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,840
So let's go no further, Mr. Payne.

78
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,640
We must at this point bring in that virtual lug.

79
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,400
Time appropriate greetings, mama room.

80
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,240
Pip, pip, pip.

81
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,080
Hello.

82
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,120
Hey.

83
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,800
Hello, hello guys.

84
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,340
What a friendly bunch over there.

85
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,400
We got a great crowd too.

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,280
We got Brent, Charlie, Eric, and another Eric.

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,480
Fun, I'm gonna say, I like fundatils,

88
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,120
but it looks like it should be fundutils.

89
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,960
Fundatilus.

90
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,080
Minimex in there.

91
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,320
New Nix is in there.

92
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,580
Popey Rotten, Ryan, Sean, and see me.

93
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,760
All rocking in there.

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,040
Plus we got a few other stragglers hanging out

95
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,520
in the off-air quiet listening.

96
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,500
You know, we never really mentioned that.

97
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,840
But you could join the mumble room.

98
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,380
And if you're just getting used to the idea,

99
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,720
you could just listen in the quiet listening room.

100
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,560
You don't even have to come on air.

101
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,400
And then if something piques your interest,

102
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,320
you could pop in.

103
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,680
I'm just saying, just saying, go Google Jupiter colony

104
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,000
mumble, join us, it's an open.

105
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,920
That's how you feel really close to us.

106
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,240
You know, you're right there next to us.

107
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,820
You can almost talk and when you're ready, you can.

108
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,160
It's like being right there

109
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,480
without having to smell our breath.

110
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,040
That's a big bonus.

111
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,080
I don't know why, I don't know why.

112
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,440
Hey, so let's talk new software.

113
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,680
Let's kick things off with the community news.

114
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,240
Let's talk, actually, let's talk all kinds of new releases.

115
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,880
So I guess first off, before I go too far,

116
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,000
if I sound a little different,

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,600
or if the show sounds a little different,

118
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,480
I am, I'm on location this week.

119
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm down in Texas doing some meetings and conversations

120
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,120
here at Linux Academy,

121
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,360
touching base with the stakeholders, Wes, you know.

122
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,200
That's important.

123
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,800
Stakeholders love to be informed.

124
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,100
They want to give you their opinions.

125
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,160
They want check-ins.

126
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,080
So it's very important that you're doing this.

127
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh man, the worst trip yet.

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,640
It went all down as soon as I got in Texas,

129
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,380
like in, like Seattle went fine.

130
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,440
Traffic was typical, you know,

131
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,280
got over to the airport with plenty of time,

132
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,800
got myself the TSA pre-check.

133
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,640
So I just blast through security now.

134
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,760
Oh, nice.

135
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,360
Yeah, yeah.

136
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,120
Got myself some nice fast wifi

137
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,280
so I could get connected while I waited for the plane.

138
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,720
You know, I was able to pre-sauce before the flight.

139
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,080
No complaints there, good flight.

140
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,840
Land in Texas and discover that there's no cars available.

141
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,080
I tried to book the day before.

142
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,760
Like in all, there's just, there's just no car.

143
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,240
They don't have cars there anymore.

144
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,720
In all of Dallas, Fort Worth area, nobody,

145
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,960
at least in my reach, has a car.

146
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,000
Not Hertz, not Avis, not Turo,

147
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,700
not the cheapo place that I can't remember the name,

148
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,040
that's a local mom pop.

149
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,920
Nobody had cars because there was a football game

150
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,060
and a NASCAR event and some major industry down here

151
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,360
is having an all hands meeting.

152
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,400
And you're not, you don't get to go

153
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,560
to any of those fun events.

154
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,400
You gotta go work.

155
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,360
No, right, right.

156
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,040
And you know what else that means?

157
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,760
No hotel for me, no hotel.

158
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,720
I apparently. Wait, what?

159
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,880
Yeah, well, apparently my administrative assistant

160
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,360
and me made a mistake.

161
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,960
Oh, that guy's, he's the worst.

162
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,800
He is the worst.

163
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,320
And this is a mistake that he doesn't normally make,

164
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,900
but apparently he made.

165
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,920
So I gotta fire that guy.

166
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,400
He, I guess, only booked the hotel

167
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,140
for the day he's leaving town,

168
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,840
not for the whole date range that I'm going to be here.

169
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,760
So I get in and at this point,

170
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,640
I've been traveling since 7 a.m.

171
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,980
and it's now about 7 p.m.

172
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,640
And you know, when I start getting tired,

173
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,400
I don't really feel like being really social.

174
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,840
I just kind of want to be left alone, you know?

175
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,840
And Uber rides, not to be a complainer,

176
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,040
but they can be a little rough in that.

177
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,000
Cause I just, I don't know, I just,

178
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't really feel like making pleasant conversation

179
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,400
cause I'm kind of exhausted from 12 hours of traveling.

180
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,000
And you know, so you make your pleasant conversation

181
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,160
for 30 minutes or whatever.

182
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,040
You get to the hotel and I'm ready to just lay down.

183
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,240
Haven't had food yet.

184
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,280
Cause all I've had is booze and airplane snacks.

185
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,640
And the lady says, we don't have a room.

186
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,480
And I said, what do you mean?

187
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,440
They gotta have a room, I booked.

188
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
She's like, oh well, Mr. Fisher,

189
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,520
I see that you're booked for the eighth.

190
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,360
For one day, yes.

191
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,800
You have no rooms available right now.

192
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,720
And here I am, and this is where it's starting to hit me.

193
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,320
Like, I'm in Texas, I can't get a car,

194
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,080
so I can't get around very well.

195
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,320
And now I don't have anywhere to stay.

196
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,280
And it's getting close to my bedtime.

197
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,640
Cause I'm an old man.

198
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,000
And so she very nicely called around

199
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and found at a hotel that's about 30 minutes further away.

200
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,380
And they got me in there and the hotel's fine.

201
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,480
I got in, but.

202
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,120
That's very nice of her.

203
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,960
Yeah, it was.

204
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,800
It was one of those moments where

205
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,680
she calls around first hotel, nothing.

206
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,060
Second hotel, nothing.

207
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,760
So now I'm three hotels, bubkiss.

208
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,660
She calls the last hotel and has a conversation.

209
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,080
They have a room, it's got two beds, you know,

210
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,040
it's not perfect, but, and I'm like, I don't care.

211
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,160
You know, my neighbor has a shack out back.

212
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,440
It doesn't get too cold till the winter, so you'll be fine.

213
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,600
So it's like on some golf course and I show up there

214
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,840
and the guy's just given me this unbelievable attitude.

215
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,800
At this point, I'm frazzled because I don't have a vehicle.

216
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,560
So I'm waiting 15 minutes for Uber drivers to show up

217
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,040
cause it's Texas and it's big.

218
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,160
And they don't know where we're going.

219
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,080
I don't know where we're going.

220
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,000
It's dark.

221
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,720
I've been traveling since 7 a.m. and it's 8 p.m.

222
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,920
And I just want to go flip through the television

223
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,800
in the hotel room and just chill out.

224
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
It's your ritual, man.

225
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,620
It's your ritual.

226
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,460
It is.

227
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,480
Your TV channels is my only time with live TV and I enjoy it.

228
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,920
I get there and the guy's like,

229
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,640
we don't have a reservation for you.

230
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,400
I'm like, no, no, it was a transfer.

231
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,240
They called and they said there was a, nobody called me.

232
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,560
No, I called, I was standing there.

233
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,760
Nope, I did not receive a call, sir.

234
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,600
Well, they talked to somebody

235
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,680
because I was standing there with you.

236
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,040
Well, they didn't call her and they didn't call me.

237
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,960
So they didn't talk to anybody here.

238
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,760
And I'm like, whoa, dude, okay.

239
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,920
Well, do you have a room open?

240
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,760
Oh yeah, we have a room.

241
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,740
Sure, yeah, that's no problem.

242
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,160
Okay, can I have that room, please?

243
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,400
All of that just to like, I want to pay you money

244
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,120
for the service that supposedly you offer to the public.

245
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,700
Whew, I was so done at that point.

246
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,540
I was so done.

247
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,000
But yeah, I'm down here at the Linux Academy headquarters

248
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,120
to plan for 2019, big plans, got some ambitious goals.

249
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,680
And they're also doing, speaking of ambitious goals,

250
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,560
they're doing a content launch this last part of the year.

251
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,360
They're launching over 200 content,

252
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,360
like library courses and just tons of stuff, right?

253
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
I mean, when you think what it takes together

254
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,400
to put like a how-to, and these are so much bigger

255
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,960
with labs and interactive diagrams,

256
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,780
and of course video and audio voiceovers,

257
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,320
and tons of things you could do

258
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,920
to actually try it on production systems.

259
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,800
Like it's just, it's so much bigger than a how-to

260
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,400
and they're launching so much stuff.

261
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,080
So they're doing a whole bunch of live streams

262
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,720
and I've got some experience with that.

263
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,880
So now that they have somebody on staff

264
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,560
that's got quite a bit of experience with that,

265
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,760
they have me come down and I'm more than happy to do it.

266
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,420
And we co-anchored the first live stream this morning,

267
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,120
which also, apparently my Google calendar

268
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,560
is set to not update its time zone.

269
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,400
So I thought I had to-

270
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,880
You're stuck in PSD.

271
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,080
Yeah, well, I can fix it, but I hadn't.

272
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,800
And so I wake up and I, oh crap,

273
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,960
I got a live stream at 8.30,

274
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,280
I better get over to the office.

275
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,840
I get here and it's not till 10.30.

276
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,880
So yeah, yeah.

277
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,360
But just as an aside,

278
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,240
I got a little peek behind the curtain

279
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,760
and I didn't even see the whole thing,

280
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,400
but by my count, 20,000 Linux servers

281
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,800
are running this place.

282
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,960
Let that sink in for a second.

283
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,820
20,000 Linux servers.

284
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,660
Yeah.

285
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,880
That's some power right there.

286
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,960
That's a lot of Linux servers.

287
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,440
And students can then individually

288
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,560
spin up to nine VMs themselves,

289
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,440
which are all Linux. That's per student, right?

290
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,320
So there's a lot of students going on there.

291
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,200
Yeah, that is, I mean,

292
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,880
just mind blowing when I heard that number.

293
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,960
And I also, just as an aside,

294
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,520
talked to a couple of Fedora users,

295
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,840
speaking of Fedora,

296
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,000
and they're all on 28.

297
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,160
They have not upgraded.

298
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,800
None of them have upgraded to 29 yet.

299
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,320
I think anybody who uses Fedora

300
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,480
as a workstation does that.

301
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,320
They wait.

302
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,140
Isn't that the secret?

303
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,800
You're like, well, I mean, even honestly,

304
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,440
on Ubuntu, I'll sometimes do that too.

305
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,280
If you don't need to update,

306
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,800
there's not like one critical update

307
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,880
you're really waiting to come through,

308
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,360
better to just play it safe.

309
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,240
Yeah, I suppose so.

310
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,320
It seems like that's the,

311
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,120
and you know, I asked them,

312
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,960
and none of them are worried

313
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,000
about their extensions breaking.

314
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,080
They're like, oh, no, it's fine.

315
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,920
It's fine, because they're all,

316
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,480
oh, I should say they're all on Gnome show.

317
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,160
All right, so speaking of Gnome,

318
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
let's talk about KDE.

319
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
See what I did there?

320
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,800
Yeah, KDE Connect has got some new stuff.

321
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,800
So first of all, version 1.10 of KDE Connect has shipped.

322
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
And that is for the Android version.

323
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,600
That's the Android app.

324
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,760
And it's not only got a new UI,

325
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,600
but they're now targeting Android 8,

326
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,000
which has several implications

327
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,520
for you active users out there.

328
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,200
Targeting Oreo comes with an updated support library,

329
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,880
which forces the project to drop support

330
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,160
for Android 4 and below.

331
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,280
Well, there are still people out there,

332
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,120
even in this audience,

333
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,560
that are using Android 4, surprisingly,

334
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,680
and probably for various good reasons.

335
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,240
And according to the KDE Connect stats,

336
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,640
it works out to be about 400 of their users

337
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,840
that will be affected by this.

338
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,000
This is kind of surprisingly a big update,

339
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,800
because with, you know, moving things to Oreo,

340
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,920
there's more restrictions,

341
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,560
things like to be able to run in the background all the time,

342
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,160
which is sort of a core feature of what KDE Connect does,

343
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,600
you have to show a persistent notification.

344
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,520
Now, the good news is Android has decent controls here,

345
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,880
so you can hide the notification.

346
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,280
The bad news is they can't do it by default.

347
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,040
Mm-hmm, yeah.

348
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,960
Now, it doesn't affect notifications in general

349
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,800
for KDE Connect,

350
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,320
just the persistent notification

351
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,280
for the application itself.

352
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:36,480
I hadn't gotten enough experience with KDE Connect yet

353
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,840
to appreciate this particular issue,

354
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,440
but one of the things it's fixed in 1.10

355
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,640
is mouse input now works at the same speed,

356
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,240
independent from what the phone's pixel density is,

357
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,880
which I didn't realize was even a thing,

358
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,880
that that would be a problem, but I guess, you know.

359
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,800
Wow, I mean, that's something to think of,

360
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,840
because if I was having that issue,

361
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,120
it would be really confusing.

362
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,040
Also, very nice, the media controller now allows

363
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,640
stopping of playback of what's on your machine.

364
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,960
Yeah, that's actually super handy,

365
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,240
and I've used that one already.

366
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,560
The other thing I saw that was really neat

367
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,880
is they now have registered up with KDE Connect colon slash

368
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,720
slash as a URL, so if you're integrating with NFC tags,

369
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,560
QR codes, third-party applications

370
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,960
that wanna launch something in KDE Connect,

371
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,160
you've got a way to do it.

372
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,920
That's so awesome, that is so great.

373
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,960
I have a lot of respect for the project,

374
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,400
I've met some of the individuals involved with it,

375
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,600
and I just thought they were great people.

376
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,600
You know, I was at a KDE meetup of some kind

377
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,520
that was in Seattle, and one of the developers,

378
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,600
I think it was one of the main developers,

379
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,640
had just moved to Seattle at the time.

380
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,000
Yeah, I was there with you, Chris.

381
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,240
Oh yeah, that's right.

382
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,360
Can you fill in the details, Eric,

383
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,240
because I'm fuzzy on them at this point.

384
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,280
It was like a, was it like a design meetup?

385
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,120
I can't remember.

386
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,360
It was the guy who invented KDE Connect.

387
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,920
Right, I know that was the guy that was there,

388
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,480
but what was the event, why were we even there?

389
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,400
It was a celebration of some sorts,

390
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,320
but it was also just a KDE meetup

391
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,280
that was happening in the Seattle area at the time.

392
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,920
Yeah, it was good, I enjoyed it, and he was there,

393
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,360
and at the time, I had talked to him about the project,

394
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,360
and I'd asked him, where are you going to go with it?

395
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,680
And even back then, I think some of the things

396
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,320
that we see now, like GS Connect and whatnot,

397
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,480
were kind of on the horizon,

398
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,560
but now KDE Connect is a mature project with tons of users.

399
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,960
GS Connect has just recently seen some nice improvements,

400
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,880
which is the gnome shell side of the camp,

401
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,320
so you can get some of the similar functionality

402
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,040
that KDE Connect provides.

403
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,880
And if you're not, I guess I should say,

404
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,040
if you're not familiar with KDE Connect,

405
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,520
it is a companion app and a piece of software

406
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,640
that runs on the plasma desktop that has a plasmoid

407
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,080
and some settings that you configure.

408
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,080
You launch the Android app, you see it,

409
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,880
you get a shared pin code, you enter that code,

410
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,840
the two things are connected over Wi-Fi,

411
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,120
they're talking, it's encrypted, it's beautiful,

412
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,760
you get a shared keyboard, you get shared media controls,

413
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,440
you get shared notifications,

414
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,360
you even transfer files back and forth, it's really cool.

415
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,880
So KDE Connect's a great project,

416
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,840
and GS Connect is worth checking out.

417
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,840
Anybody else have anything to add on the KDE Connect

418
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,360
or GS Connect topic?

419
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,760
And I saw that recently, I can't remember,

420
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,000
I think it was on the Ubuntu podcast

421
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
that I think someone mentioned that GS Connect

422
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,240
is in the repo for 18.10,

423
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,000
if you want to get the latest and greatest.

424
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,840
Yep, that's right.

425
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,680
So there you go.

426
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,520
Ooh, that is nice.

427
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,360
Gnome users suffer no more.

428
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Unless you want to run that gnome desktop on a new Mac.

429
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,480
This is the story that has gotten the most attention

430
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,400
this week so far.

431
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,440
And it's had an interesting life cycle

432
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,360
because Ferronix ran a piece

433
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,560
that I have been wondering about

434
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,960
that said Apple's new hardware with the T2 security chip

435
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,040
will currently block Linux from booting.

436
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,840
And everybody kind of got upset.

437
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,120
And then it sort of ducked down when everybody said,

438
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,520
oh, hold down, hold on.

439
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,600
If you disable secure boot, everything's fine.

440
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,200
And then the story kind of died down.

441
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,560
And then it came back.

442
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,800
Even if you disable secure boot, Linux is still screwed.

443
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,640
And now the story's blown up again.

444
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,880
So at least until further notice,

445
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,960
the new Apple systems that they've been recently announcing

446
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,320
like the iMac Pro and the Mac Mini

447
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,880
that use the T2 chip will not be able to boot Linux on them.

448
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,320
If you're not like Chris

449
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,760
who follows the Apple news just ravenously,

450
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,520
the T2 is a security chip Apple's made

451
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,560
or got made for them custom

452
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,360
that's embedded into all of their newest products.

453
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,040
And it's a secure enclave.

454
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,800
It does APFS storage encryption,

455
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,640
UEFI secure boot validation, touch ID handling,

456
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,800
a hardware microphone disconnect for all you privacy lovers

457
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,760
and a whole bunch of other little security functions.

458
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,920
But as a result,

459
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,080
and you probably guessed this with UEFI in there,

460
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,400
the T2 restricts the boot process

461
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,400
and verifies each step using crypto keys signed by Apple.

462
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,240
Now on its own,

463
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,480
this would probably be a pretty good thing, right?

464
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
I mean, this is a lot of security functionality.

465
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,960
If you're concerned about that,

466
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,240
there's a lot of controls here.

467
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,320
Unfortunately, there's not a lot of ways

468
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,600
for the user to actually control it.

469
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,960
Yeah, yeah, there's a few settings they expose,

470
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,080
but as the Ferronix article notes in its second update,

471
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,120
apparently reportedly it's still blocking Linux.

472
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,920
You can, there is a way to use Windows 10 on there right now.

473
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,200
So I'm sure we'll eventually,

474
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,080
somebody will figure it out.

475
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,960
Right, the difficulty there is that they've used the key

476
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,320
that Microsoft uses for Windows,

477
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,720
but they have a separate key

478
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,320
that they use for all the third party things

479
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,600
like Fedora or Ubuntu went through all that work

480
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,520
to go get Microsoft to sign their bootloaders.

481
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,360
Right.

482
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,600
None of that gets us anywhere here.

483
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,640
Right, oh my gosh, that's so frustrating.

484
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,400
And you know, to be fair,

485
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,840
Apple's own documentation makes it pretty clear.

486
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,040
It even mentions Linux.

487
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,160
It says, and I'll read it just directly,

488
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,000
there is currently no trust provided

489
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,280
for the Microsoft corporation UEFI CA 2011,

490
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,600
which would allow a verification code

491
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,120
signed by Microsoft partners.

492
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,360
The UEFI CA is commonly used to verify the authenticity

493
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,600
of bootloaders for other operating systems,

494
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,880
such as Linux variants.

495
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,880
And since they don't have support for it, no love for you.

496
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,640
So no Mac mini running the latest and greatest

497
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,320
gnome shell or plasma for you.

498
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,320
There was a lot of confusion because for a while

499
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,280
it seemed like you could boot up into recovery mode

500
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,800
and disable secure boot entirely,

501
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,240
and then not have to worry about this

502
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,080
and be able to boot into Linux,

503
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,000
but the latest reports say no dice.

504
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,440
Yep, all right, so they just crushed your dreams

505
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,720
for that Mac, so better go to your backup plan.

506
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,040
You know, like that new Thelio hardware

507
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,880
is looking pretty good,

508
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,740
although it's much bigger than a Mac mini.

509
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,520
Now, see, that was probably the most outraged story

510
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
of the week.

511
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,880
Every unplugged needs one, right?

512
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,640
We gotta have one.

513
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,600
I sometimes think that's what fuels our Linux.

514
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,280
So, you know, the next story though,

515
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,840
I think has people going, what, really?

516
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,800
Huh, okay.

517
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,020
And that is that Microsoft's making

518
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,440
some more open source code.

519
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,160
Proc dump is coming to Linux,

520
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,800
which it's sort of like a re-imagining

521
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,980
of the classic proc dump tool

522
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,880
that was from the sysinternal suite

523
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,720
of tools for Windows,

524
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,320
which actually is a pretty legit suite of tools,

525
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,240
and proc dump provides a convenient way

526
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,560
for Linux developers to create core dumps

527
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,480
of their application based on performance triggers.

528
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,080
It's pretty sweet, and they have it up on GitHub right now.

529
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,160
You can do things like get the CPU threshold

530
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,960
at which to create a dump of the process,

531
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,280
or below, like there's all kinds of like memory limits.

532
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,220
You can, when a memory limit is triggered,

533
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,960
you can begin to do a proc dump

534
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,760
and get a snapshot of what's going on.

535
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,080
This is pretty neat, eh, Mr. Payne?

536
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,480
Oh yeah, actually it's really easy.

537
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,720
While you were describing it,

538
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,600
I installed it up here in the studio,

539
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,680
and no problems, even on a newer operating system,

540
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,120
the 16.04 devs work just fine.

541
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,240
I'll also note that this isn't some like super weird port.

542
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,480
If you look at the code,

543
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,900
it's really minimal, pretty clean C,

544
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,840
so it seems sort of like they've been

545
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,320
not necessarily porting the actual sysinternal stuff,

546
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,920
but being inspired by the user experience of sysinternals,

547
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,600
and then bringing similar tools to Linux.

548
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,000
Because as everyone has pointed out

549
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,440
over on our Linux already,

550
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,680
like look, we don't need this, right?

551
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,240
We have all the information we want,

552
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,640
we know how to scrape slash proc,

553
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,480
we have a bunch of command line tools already,

554
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,400
but we have to admit that

555
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,040
on the non-open source side of things,

556
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
Microsoft has spent a long time

557
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,760
either buying or making, or both in this case,

558
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,800
refining administrative tooling.

559
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,080
So if we can get a little bit of that perspective on Linux,

560
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,480
hey, that's not a bad thing.

561
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,840
Yeah, and I think also there's,

562
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,640
is brand the right way?

563
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,400
Is there some brand recognition with that name?

564
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,240
You know, you're coming over from Windows,

565
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,600
now you've got SSH,

566
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,840
you've got the Windows subsystem for Linux,

567
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,160
you've got proc dump,

568
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,480
you've got all these tools

569
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,960
that are sort of like industry known.

570
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,880
And even if there's already ways to do it,

571
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,480
I think that's perfectly valid.

572
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,600
I was digging around,

573
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,280
I could be way off because I'm no expert,

574
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,360
but I was digging around their project page on GitHub,

575
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,160
and it looks like maybe they've been

576
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,320
kind of tooling away at this for nearly a year,

577
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,120
and only a few days ago,

578
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,960
I think, did people start discovering it.

579
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,400
And I was checking out to see what the license was,

580
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,920
which was, that was like one of the,

581
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,760
I think that was the very first commit they made,

582
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,160
was the license, which is an MIT license.

583
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,640
And that commit was made on November 10th, 2017.

584
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,520
So this has been coming for a little bit.

585
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,280
That's what's, I think, underappreciated

586
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,240
about these Microsoft open source announcements,

587
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,720
is they, in a lot of cases, I come to discover,

588
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,040
have been in the works for a really long time.

589
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,960
You're absolutely right.

590
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,240
Yeah, we don't see it till they actually dump it,

591
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,920
or release it, and you don't appreciate

592
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,600
that that took one internal buy off, right?

593
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,120
That actual developers are getting paid

594
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,160
to work on that on their work time,

595
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,840
and that eventually it did get open source,

596
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,800
because it's so easy to have those projects

597
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,240
be created internally, and then just wither and die.

598
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,040
Yeah, I think it's hard to appreciate from the outside,

599
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,320
just because we don't know what their processes are.

600
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,640
We don't know at what speed they move, in general.

601
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,280
And so we don't have really any tool sets

602
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,920
to recognize when they're moving fast,

603
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,640
versus moving slow, but every time I dig into it,

604
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,720
it seems like it's a multi-year process.

605
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,920
We just talked about, recently, on Coder Radio,

606
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,280
that.NET Core is now becoming the de facto.NET.

607
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,240
And that's a pretty big deal,

608
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,280
because.NET Core has only been around

609
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,320
for a couple of years, a few years.

610
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,680
Whereas.NET, the thing that's been Windows only,

611
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,120
well, sort of, for so long,

612
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,880
it's been around for like, what, 15, 20 years?

613
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,280
I don't know, it's somewhere in that range.

614
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,880
It's surprisingly old now, which makes me feel old.

615
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,000
And when I had a conversation at Microsoft

616
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,400
with Jeffrey and a couple of other folks,

617
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,240
I asked them, I said, with.NET Core,

618
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,160
why do you have.NET and.NET Core?

619
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,360
I don't understand why you have two things.

620
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,640
It seems like a mixed message,

621
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,600
and I didn't understand who.NET Core was for

622
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,080
versus who.NET was for.

623
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,160
And why is one proprietary and closed source

624
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,000
and one's open source?

625
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,480
I just didn't understand any of it.

626
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,960
And the way they explained it to me

627
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,320
was kind of a bombshell in a way,

628
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,760
because if you parse what they said,

629
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,240
it was sort of intention signaling, like a while ago.

630
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,680
They said.NET Core is their current focus,

631
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,280
and.NET is going to be for legacy platform support.

632
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,280
Well, the platform that.NET runs on is Windows.

633
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,680
And they called it a legacy platform.

634
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,280
Now, maybe that was just the words they chose to use,

635
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,400
but that's an interesting mindset, I think.

636
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,520
So are we coming to the agreement

637
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,520
that maybe I was right all these years?

638
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,400
Well, does Azure Sphere OS count?

639
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,600
Because that is technically a Linux distribution

640
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,920
that Microsoft is using.

641
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,840
No, no, I said that they would have a Linux distribution

642
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,880
with a Windows desktop that gets shipped

643
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,000
by default in all machines like currently Windows does.

644
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,800
That's the thing.

645
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,040
It's going to happen, mark my words,

646
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,280
and I have another view on this thing of the core.

647
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,240
It's just that if you have any open source project

648
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,360
that has already everything defined,

649
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,080
people generally don't come around

650
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,920
and jump in to contribute, because everything is defined.

651
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,960
So this is a good strategy for people to work with.

652
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,760
So this is a good strategy for people to want to contribute

653
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,040
and actually have community involvement

654
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,520
while they still keep bringing the other stuff.

655
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
It also is a great refactor opportunity

656
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,080
because they really have found a hard time hiring people

657
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,560
that understand the real old code base.

658
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,720
So it's an opportunity to refactor, make it decoupled,

659
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,480
and at the same time, gain the momentum of open source.

660
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,320
They love this.

661
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,440
They're doing the right things,

662
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,880
but it's just going to take a while.

663
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,720
2020, come on, it's getting closer.

664
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,040
You know, as it gets closer,

665
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,720
I started to think more and more, you're right.

666
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,560
Initially, when you said it,

667
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,080
I'm like, that's the craziest crap I've ever heard.

668
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,160
But now I'm like, I could almost see it.

669
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,960
They just reversed the subsystem.

670
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,200
And so you run a Linux type desktop as the main desktop,

671
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,880
and then you have a Windows subsystem

672
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,400
that runs Windows on Linux.

673
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,240
Pretty much.

674
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,320
That's exactly what I said.

675
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,840
If you go on the backlog of the shows,

676
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,280
I said exactly that would happen.

677
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,840
Well, you make sure we never forget, too.

678
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,680
So I don't have to go to the back catalog, Dari.

679
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,320
But, you know, it will be the ultimate.

680
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,560
It will be the ultimate prediction when it happens.

681
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,040
Five-year prediction.

682
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,600
Well, you don't have to go five years out

683
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,760
for good news about Linux kernel 4.20.

684
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,880
Everybody's excited for the 4.20 kernel.

685
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,240
And this one is going to improve your views, man.

686
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,280
Wow, everybody loves the user space file system.

687
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,800
Nobody really considers it to be very performant.

688
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,840
And over time, over time,

689
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,640
things have gotten better with views.

690
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,400
But it looks like there are

691
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,280
more performance optimizations to be had.

692
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,200
Oh, yeah.

693
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,400
That includes symlink caching,

694
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,680
a new hash table optimization,

695
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,040
and copy file range support.

696
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:59,120
Plus, the maximum IO signs for views has been increased

697
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,880
from 128k up to an actual, a full, a full meg.

698
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,720
What?

699
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,080
And there's like a whole bunch of other improvements

700
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,520
that are working on this.

701
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,640
I thought it was interesting, too,

702
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,760
because some of this stuff,

703
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,880
like actual users are submitting it.

704
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,760
Some users saw that they were having problems

705
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,080
where symlinks just weren't cached

706
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,480
the same as normal files.

707
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,320
And that was a bottleneck.

708
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,320
So they're like, Facebook, actually, in this case,

709
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,920
Facebook said like, look, this is a big problem.

710
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,960
We're using symlinks a lot.

711
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,000
It's slower than using regular files.

712
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,160
Their fix adds a 10% improvement on top of that.

713
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,080
The other thing I think that's neat about this

714
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,680
is there are some EBPF fixes,

715
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,680
in particular for that copy file range support.

716
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,920
And that is actually pretty important

717
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,840
if you want to do server side copying,

718
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,880
which I'm sure you've run into, right?

719
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,200
You're trying to copy a file,

720
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,280
two folders on like you're on your NAS somewhere.

721
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,440
You don't want to be in the position

722
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,080
where you have to copy it all the way to your workstation

723
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,120
and then copy it back to the server.

724
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,000
Thanks to some of the EBPF changes that they've got,

725
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,520
some of the changes in views,

726
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,800
that's going to be a lot easier.

727
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:59,200
Oh, so have we given our whole EBPF spiel on this show?

728
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,040
I can't remember,

729
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,120
because the Portland user Linux group thing,

730
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:02,960
where we talked about it too,

731
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,800
is kind of throwing it off.

732
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,640
Wes and I kind of did like a mini show

733
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,000
down at the Portland Linux users group last Thursday,

734
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,840
was it?

735
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,680
Yeah, it was last Thursday.

736
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,800
And ton of fun, jumped in my golf

737
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,920
and we drove down to Portland,

738
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,680
which is like a three, three and a half, four hour drive.

739
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,120
And we hung out with Michael Dexter,

740
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,720
who pretty much runs the Portland Linux users group.

741
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,240
Ironically, Michael Dexter is sort of famously a BSD guy.

742
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,680
And he runs it with one of the free BSD co-founders.

743
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,960
I mean, Rod doesn't really run it,

744
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,640
but he's there with Dexter all the time.

745
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,200
So it's a couple of moral support.

746
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,040
I asked him about it.

747
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,960
I said, so Michael, I've been meaning to ask you,

748
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,680
but as a BSD user,

749
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,160
why are you so involved with the Linux users group?

750
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,760
And he said, well, it's really, it's a Unix users group.

751
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,520
It's just mostly Linux.

752
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,360
And it's kind of true.

753
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
And you know what?

754
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,400
They have a good open discussion around it too.

755
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,100
It's like, everything's on the table.

756
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,820
And it was just, I don't know, I just really enjoyed it.

757
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,400
It was nice to just chat casually,

758
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,720
you know what I mean about this kind of stuff

759
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,200
that we read about all the time.

760
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,400
You know, even though we do shows about it,

761
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,240
you know what I mean?

762
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,060
It was still fun.

763
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,900
It's a little more high pressure, right?

764
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,640
In the shows, we're trying to get things right.

765
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,480
We've got interviews,

766
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,760
or we've got guests with heated opinions,

767
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,000
both for or against or good or bad.

768
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,680
And this was more of just a group of people

769
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,480
who were all interested in this for their own reasons,

770
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,280
coming together, having a chat.

771
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,120
Yeah, and it really drove home

772
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,120
that whole concept that we have here on the show

773
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,540
that Linux user groups are like one of the best,

774
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,760
best things about the Linux community.

775
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,840
And you don't have to be in a town that has a user group

776
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,800
to be part of a Linux user group.

777
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,560
They had, I'm blanking on the gentleman's name,

778
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:49,560
but they had a member that is essentially from New York

779
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,960
that was in town,

780
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,640
and so participated in the Lug in person that time,

781
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,040
but normally watches on the live stream

782
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,400
and participates on the mailing list

783
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,520
and is an active member of the Portland Linux Users Group

784
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
from New York.

785
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,120
And I think that really demonstrates.

786
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,960
I asked him, I said,

787
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,760
so why are you a member of a Portland Linux,

788
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,000
that's on the other side of the country?

789
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,600
He said, well, you know, the nearest one to me

790
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,640
is about 200 miles away,

791
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,880
and I just really liked this group.

792
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,400
And it's the Portland Linux Users Group's been around

793
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,360
for like 20 years,

794
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,520
so it's pretty well established on the West Coast.

795
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,660
And so he's a member of it from that far away.

796
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,560
And I think that's something

797
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,220
that everybody should just give some thought

798
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,040
if you wanna get more involved in the Linux community,

799
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,640
if you wanna talk to more like-minded technical people.

800
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,620
And I'll say, you know, we have a virtual Lug too,

801
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,000
and it is a group of people that get together

802
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,300
and we hang out every week for a couple of hours.

803
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,280
We meet more often than a regular Lug does.

804
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,120
Right, yeah.

805
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,680
I mean, that was what surprised me is, you know,

806
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,280
Michael Dexter does a lot of work to keep that going,

807
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,320
but you get surprising results.

808
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,760
You know, they have a live stream, they have an IRC room.

809
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,920
I'm sure there are times where, you know,

810
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,840
no one really actively joins the live stream or participates,

811
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,720
but if you leave something out,

812
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,200
if you set that up so people can communicate,

813
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,240
I think you're often surprised by how many people reach out.

814
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,880
Yeah, I kinda wanna go again.

815
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,340
I should totally say that there was this time

816
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,880
that the Portland Linux Group used JB, long time ago,

817
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,920
I'm not sure if you guys remembered,

818
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,040
to broadcast some event they had.

819
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,560
And since then, there was actually a Linux IRC channel

820
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,880
of this Portland Linux Group that essentially,

821
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,000
dragged lots of people to actually keep visiting that IRC.

822
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And since they have such a regular publication

823
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,080
of their actual events online in the stream,

824
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,800
lots of people can actually attend remotely,

825
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,840
which is something that maybe other groups

826
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,000
don't have as much, which helps.

827
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,440
Yeah, you know, that was when Linus visited

828
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,160
the Portland Linux User Group that we streamed in.

829
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,800
That was a special, that was a special, yeah.

830
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,000
He was there for an anniversary,

831
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,640
and he just took questions from the plug.

832
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,160
And I don't know, after I went to it,

833
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,080
I felt like I could do this, I could do this more often,

834
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,640
especially if I took the train or something,

835
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,760
because we drove and it was a little exhausting

836
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,120
to drive four hours, one, each direction.

837
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,120
Yeah, I think next time we'll make a whole day of it,

838
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,160
we'll stay overnight,

839
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,560
we'll get a nice Portland brunch in the morning.

840
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,240
Yeah, yeah, although Wes and I

841
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,620
did have a nice romantic evening.

842
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,680
That was, that was lovely.

843
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,720
It was quite, not only was it geeky,

844
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,360
and we did some work on the project

845
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,120
that we're gonna be talking about in a little moment,

846
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,240
on the drive down.

847
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,080
So Wes got his ThinkPad in his laptop

848
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,420
while I'm driving with the MiFi going.

849
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,880
But then we couldn't really find a place to eat,

850
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,160
but we decided we were gonna set out

851
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,080
and try to travel around Portland and just find something.

852
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,640
We started walking around.

853
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,120
Everything looked a little too fancy,

854
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,480
but time was getting tight,

855
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,600
it was almost time to go to the meetup,

856
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,760
so we walk into this place,

857
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,880
and it didn't seem, it was just on the line.

858
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,480
Like, it had cloth tables and all that stuff,

859
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,160
and cloth napkins, but it seemed like they,

860
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,360
they would also take somebody like me

861
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,580
who was a bit of a slob.

862
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,520
And she's like, oh, would you like to sit

863
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,440
in the dining area, or would you like to sit in the bar?

864
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,120
And both Wes and I look over, and they have a,

865
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,120
you know, they have a fine bar.

866
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,960
It's just a small little bar that's part of a restaurant.

867
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,040
And we're like, well, I guess the bar.

868
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,000
She's like, all right, well, that's around the corner,

869
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,200
down the hallway to the left, and then up the stairs.

870
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,040
Like, what?

871
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,860
Oh, okay.

872
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,700
Stairs?

873
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,540
What are you talking about?

874
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,560
This place was great.

875
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,600
It was, that was where we wanted to be.

876
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,500
It was a happening place.

877
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,680
What was the theme of the restaurant?

878
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,520
Was it a, it wasn't an Irish, but.

879
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,800
It's a British, Irish-inspired comfort food sort of thing.

880
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,680
That was kind of like a mix. It's called Raven and Rose.

881
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,720
Yeah, there you go.

882
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,040
You can look it up if you're ever in Seattle.

883
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,560
And then asked to go to the bar.

884
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,680
Don't go to the main restaurant.

885
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,240
And then you get to go to the secret upstairs bar.

886
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
That was pretty good.

887
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,200
So we went down there, we chatted with them,

888
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,560
and the fedora things came up, but also, you know,

889
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,440
a lot of people had the whole IBM acquisition

890
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,280
still in their mind.

891
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,680
That was something that was, we talked about

892
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,080
quite a bit there, and I just really enjoyed it.

893
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,640
So I just want to encourage, just want to take a moment

894
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,080
to show and encourage everybody, give it a consideration,

895
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,680
even if you have to participate from half a country away,

896
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,520
or more, still give it some consideration.

897
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,360
Plus, you know, it always gives you a place to visit.

898
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,080
Yes, and I mean, to that end too,

899
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,220
I think it's just a nice, it's a nice reason to meet people.

900
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,300
You have a common interest,

901
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,400
but you don't have to talk about that.

902
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,800
So while we were there, we got a surprise lecture

903
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,160
about carnivorous plants.

904
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,880
And that was just a neat thing to learn,

905
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,720
a way to engage people.

906
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,480
Didn't have to do anything with your regular interests

907
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,880
or your job or anything else.

908
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,920
Just an excuse to chat about something fun.

909
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,560
Yeah, it was definitely, it's an example of something

910
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,040
I wouldn't look up on YouTube.

911
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,960
I wouldn't intend to talk if I was at a conference.

912
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,400
But if you're at a plug for a couple of hours,

913
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,160
you're at the plug and somebody brings it up

914
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,680
and you're there, it's actually interesting.

915
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,640
It was pretty neat.

916
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
So check it out.

917
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,560
Anyways, get involved.

918
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,520
I wanted to bring up, speaking of the whole IBM acquisition

919
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,440
and Microsoft and all of that,

920
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,200
some bigger picture topics for this week's episode.

921
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,400
I thought we could zoom out a little bit,

922
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,800
get away from some of the specifics and talk big picture.

923
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,320
And Mumble Room, I want you guys to get in on this

924
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,140
because I miss you, I want to hear from you.

925
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,600
So I thought we'd start with this article

926
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,040
that was over at lightreading.com.

927
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,560
And it's in their open source section,

928
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,720
so you know it's gotta be legit

929
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,760
because they've got an open source section.

930
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,560
And the author, Mitch Wagner, proposes

931
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,480
that the open source revolution is over

932
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,600
and the revolutionaries have won.

933
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,240
And he writes, what happens when the revolutionaries win

934
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,160
after they've stormed the castle

935
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,800
and they've tried on the king's clothes,

936
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,260
they've slept in his bed,

937
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,360
and they've drunk the royal wine, then what?

938
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,800
Well, I think you actually have to figure out

939
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,400
how to run things.

940
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,260
But while we've seen like a ton of changes just recently,

941
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,400
probably this has been happening for a while.

942
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,480
Now, of course, there was Microsoft buying GitHub

943
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,520
and just last week, IBM purchasing Red Hat.

944
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,840
Those are huge moves,

945
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:41,200
both just focused right around open source.

946
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,560
But as we've talked about on the program

947
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,320
for several years now,

948
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,520
open source is the mainstream way of working

949
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,880
for big enterprises to small startups.

950
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,680
Yeah, yeah, I think it's a bit

951
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,880
of a developer-driven revolution too.

952
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,520
Like developers want to be able to grab a library

953
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,260
that's been written that solves a problem for them,

954
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,200
or they wanna have somebody help them problem solve

955
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,440
and communicate and collaborate.

956
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,080
If you do everything in closed source silos,

957
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,120
that's a lot more difficult.

958
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,720
But Wagner here, the author,

959
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,280
reached out to Jim Zemlin of the Linux Foundation,

960
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,240
the executive director over there

961
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,680
at the Linux Foundation. Oh, that guy.

962
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,760
Yeah, and Jim says he sees multiple factors

963
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,760
contributing to the ascent of the new paradigm.

964
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,160
He says open source won the support

965
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,480
of mainstream technology leaders,

966
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,840
such as IBM and Oracle,

967
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,600
because Linux became a standard server OS,

968
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,720
and it was embraced by non-technology companies,

969
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,040
such as Toyota and the entertainment companies,

970
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,440
such as, and the telcos, like AT&T

971
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,520
and those other big ones.

972
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,780
And of course, you can't forget people like Google.

973
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,820
I mean, Google's been leveraging open source

974
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,560
for a long time, especially projects like Android.

975
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,160
And that's what Android become basically the largest

976
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,280
operating system in the world, right?

977
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,160
Think of all of the handsets out there running Linux

978
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,680
in the form of Android.

979
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,160
Yeah, so I wanted to ask, so let's pause there.

980
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,680
I wanted to ask the mumble room.

981
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,720
So far, we have, you know, it became the default server OS,

982
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,840
but they go on here in a moment to say that really,

983
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,560
it's Android that brought this open source revolution.

984
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,440
It's because of Android

985
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,200
and the mainstream enterprise companies

986
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,240
that watched Google use open source successfully

987
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,080
that open source has blossomed so much.

988
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,740
Thank you, Android, they say.

989
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,160
I don't think so at all.

990
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,400
Yeah, I also disagree.

991
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,180
If you look, what happened is the fact that you're developing

992
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,320
for a server and that the tooling start,

993
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,000
the complexity of the server side started to grow.

994
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,480
Our big, basically sites become bigger.

995
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,600
They have to do a lot more and requires a lot more knowledge

996
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,840
of the whole system as a whole to be able to optimize for it

997
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,200
and to take the best.

998
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,800
So that meant that developers didn't want the friction

999
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,640
of having to use the changing Microsoft Philly

1000
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,280
or the Mac stuff.

1001
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,380
Docker is now being used in companies as,

1002
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,520
oh, you have it installed on your machine

1003
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,320
and you run some stuff in there.

1004
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,760
And then the question becomes like,

1005
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,520
I'm already running all of those Linux things.

1006
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,320
Why don't I just use Linux?

1007
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,860
And since companies tend to have some Linux available

1008
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,200
in there, you start using the desktop

1009
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,880
and you start developing there,

1010
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,920
which is why every other player is basically trying

1011
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,860
to have some Linux tools developer for their desktop

1012
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,360
because otherwise people will just use Linux.

1013
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,080
And as a consequence, you get Linux being,

1014
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,560
I mean, you get exposed, you get to use it,

1015
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,160
you get to use it even more.

1016
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,140
That's it.

1017
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,000
It's not Android.

1018
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,920
Android is like the end user, like the consumer.

1019
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,600
All right, well, so I think I could totally follow you there.

1020
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,820
They make the case that it's not so much

1021
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,880
that Android itself made people use open source,

1022
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,160
but that Google using open source

1023
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,080
gave the CIOs and the CTOs the permission

1024
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,420
to also use it because Google was doing it.

1025
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,480
And Google made it cool, safe, and hip for the enterprise.

1026
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,800
I know we had somebody else in there

1027
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,260
that disagreed with that.

1028
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,100
Go ahead.

1029
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,320
Yeah, that just sounds like a flimsy premise to me

1030
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,320
because, I mean, Linux is not nearly

1031
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,640
the only open source project being used

1032
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,760
in large deployments.

1033
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,000
I mean, before that we had FreeBSD and Apache,

1034
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,280
and I mean, how many people are totally lost

1035
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,240
on the command line without using Bash?

1036
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,600
I mean, this open source revolution,

1037
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,600
as the author is framing it,

1038
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,400
has been going on since before Linux

1039
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,560
was barely even a Minix ripoff.

1040
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,200
Yes, Linux is the most prominent,

1041
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,760
but that's partly because people just won't shut up

1042
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,200
about how much they love Linux.

1043
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,600
And that's not necessarily a bad thing.

1044
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,240
It's just, this is the most visible,

1045
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,720
but it has been there for years,

1046
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,760
long before people made a big deal out of DevOps and Docker

1047
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,120
and all these new old technologies

1048
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,800
being retrofitted onto Linux.

1049
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,640
FreeBSD has been powering our networks for ages now.

1050
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,880
And I almost forgot that we need to remember Linux now

1051
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,760
with its close to, it's what, 20 years now, right?

1052
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,600
Yeah.

1053
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,320
So for the longest time,

1054
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,120
universities are very slow to adapt

1055
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,860
and universities still teach Windows for a large degree,

1056
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,040
but the fact that also universities are now like,

1057
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,140
for a decade, teaching Linux,

1058
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,160
using Linux as the research material,

1059
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,240
means that the job market now is like,

1060
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,760
oh, you can just take, that person knows how to use it,

1061
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,320
knows how to deal with that stuff.

1062
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,320
And that's what they grew up with.

1063
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,200
And we need to remember what is the turn rate

1064
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,320
of producing new brains on any technology, right?

1065
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,540
So first it was the shift from universities

1066
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,460
actually producing people with Linux skills

1067
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,460
to also them getting to the market.

1068
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,760
So that takes a while.

1069
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,080
And if you look at the time span, it just fits right.

1070
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,560
I'd just like to say, I think open source

1071
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,800
has a huge influence over the years.

1072
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,580
Like, I found, especially in the Windows world,

1073
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:07,840
often to solve problems in the Windows world,

1074
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,200
the solution was use open source,

1075
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,640
like use Firefox instead of Internet Explorer,

1076
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,280
use LibreOffice instead of Microsoft Office,

1077
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,280
use a huge range of software that is available now

1078
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,240
and commonly acceptable to use in Windows,

1079
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,200
because I think a lot of the companies

1080
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,720
are changing the software and doing such practices

1081
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,600
that it's leading everyone to open source.

1082
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,560
And especially with Windows 10 and the changes

1083
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,880
from software being a program you install to cloud,

1084
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,200
there is a lot of kickback

1085
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,680
and people want that old fashioned program that you install.

1086
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,400
And with the last couple of years

1087
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,160
of free speech being an issue,

1088
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,000
people are looking into software

1089
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,100
that isn't from a traditional million dollar company

1090
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,440
and open source is getting more popular that way as well.

1091
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,880
An investor nowadays looks at what are your costs?

1092
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,160
And if you can, for example,

1093
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,760
if you are a competitor of Amazon

1094
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,260
and then you run your services in AWS,

1095
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,340
what if Amazon raises your prices, right?

1096
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,380
So all of that kind of stuff,

1097
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,860
the big companies are so entrenched in so many things,

1098
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,080
you really have no option but to be in the place

1099
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,560
that is neutral, you know, economically speaking.

1100
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,800
And yes, it is true that there is some weight

1101
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,960
on using industry best practices as an excuse, right,

1102
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,080
to use Linux and Google does give some authorization

1103
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,720
to teams that don't know what they're doing

1104
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,000
because if you will use that as a way

1105
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,200
to decide your technology, you know,

1106
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,820
but that's a personal argument.

1107
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,560
Yeah, yeah, I see your point.

1108
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,420
I think too, this is what was supposed to happen.

1109
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,940
This is what we wanted to happen.

1110
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,220
We wanted open source to kind of be the default

1111
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,520
and that's the point we're reaching.

1112
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,880
It's not universal, but I was just in a meeting today

1113
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,440
where they start with, okay, well,

1114
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,760
what components of this can we start with as open source?

1115
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,600
That's what the conversation,

1116
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,680
that's when they're talking about

1117
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,040
what Linux Academy is building next year,

1118
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,260
that's where they start the conversation.

1119
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,320
What component of these can we open source?

1120
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,480
At Jupyter Broadcasting now, we're doing the same thing.

1121
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,520
When we're working on the system,

1122
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,580
we're about to talk about.

1123
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,840
The conversation Wes and I consistently have is

1124
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,400
what of this do we open source?

1125
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,240
What open source tools can we already take advantage of

1126
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,340
so that way we can save time in building it?

1127
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,700
It just makes sense.

1128
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,680
It also helps reduce bus factor.

1129
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,760
I mean, there's tons of reasons to use open source.

1130
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,040
And I reiterate, what else did you expect?

1131
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,840
Did you want open source to be successful

1132
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,560
but not the defacto?

1133
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,640
I don't know, so these articles

1134
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,480
that try to pin it on one thing or another,

1135
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,680
they seem too narrow.

1136
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,360
Right, I mean, it's been a slow evolution

1137
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,760
this whole time, of course.

1138
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,520
And what other outcome would we want?

1139
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,220
I would also say that this is the hard work

1140
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,400
of a lot of advocates

1141
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,880
because even if you have free BSD servers

1142
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,720
running somewhere in the basement,

1143
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,480
that doesn't mean that the people at the top

1144
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,320
actually get it.

1145
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,160
And I think most of the time,

1146
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,520
it means that people at the top have no care,

1147
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,860
don't know what's happening in the tech below.

1148
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:07,160
And finally, we saw companies where the management

1149
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,360
and the parties in control are willing to embrace that

1150
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,280
and not be scared of open source and realize like,

1151
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,080
hey, this could be better for our bottom line.

1152
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,240
We can share and interrupt

1153
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,520
without having to be scared of it.

1154
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,920
We can still keep the stuff we need to keep secret.

1155
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,920
You get the lawyers on board,

1156
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,280
you get the board on board,

1157
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,720
and here we are today.

1158
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,640
Open source makes sense as the only way forward

1159
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,020
because it does provide the faster,

1160
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,700
better way of development.

1161
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,560
But I mean, the people at the top

1162
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,700
rarely even care what their phone is running.

1163
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,200
They don't know or necessarily care.

1164
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,780
They care about the bottom line.

1165
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,380
Open source saves some money.

1166
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,280
Without making this an endless discussion,

1167
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,720
I think that's also changing.

1168
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,560
Like we are actually having more technically savvy leaders

1169
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,600
because people don't buy into just these

1170
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,040
person like the Steve Jobs are not like

1171
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,320
popping up in there available everywhere

1172
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,260
for people to pick up.

1173
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,920
So technical leaders are now going on.

1174
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,920
If you look at all of the current major tech companies,

1175
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,740
the leaders are actually more tech savvy

1176
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,000
or come from a more tech background.

1177
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,980
But I digress.

1178
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:17,600
And I should say that whenever we're looking into

1179
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,960
Linux becoming the norm, well, we did a good job.

1180
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,200
We also give, we should give us credit.

1181
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,800
I mean, this show is a good credit to that, right?

1182
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,520
Just the amount of people I know that actually have,

1183
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,920
actually I was surprised.

1184
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,520
I had some, I'm in Germany now

1185
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,140
and I have some coworkers that I was never expecting.

1186
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,760
They actually are JV listeners.

1187
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,720
And it was like, yeah, that's new.

1188
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,560
Great.

1189
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,640
You know, that's actually something

1190
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,240
that I didn't used to also find frequently.

1191
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,040
Like I would say, hey, have you heard about

1192
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,160
this Jupiter broadcasting, people are like,

1193
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,720
I have no idea what they're talking about.

1194
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,760
And this is becoming also a normalization thing.

1195
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,320
It's like the culture, we're finally actually being able to,

1196
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,280
some projects, they grow big, they still open source,

1197
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,980
they're still friendly to new people,

1198
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,000
but they actually are stable.

1199
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,040
And whenever we don't, whenever we're not stable,

1200
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,760
you can just fork it and stabilize it at your pace.

1201
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,840
I would bring another thing to the discussion.

1202
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,800
There was this article, The Cathedral and the Bazaar.

1203
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,320
And I think that principle has won.

1204
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,800
So companies start to realize

1205
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,480
that close developer groups have their limits

1206
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,680
and open development is often faster and more creative.

1207
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,060
And that's, in that regard,

1208
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,800
I also see the acquisition of Red Hat by IBM.

1209
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,440
I see that in that context, that not a spirit,

1210
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,880
that bizarre spirit starts to change the world,

1211
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,120
in my opinion.

1212
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,320
And since open source is the standard now,

1213
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,040
it seemed like that was the direction

1214
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,200
for Jupiter Broadcasting to go with its new projects.

1215
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,680
And we've been trying to launch an automation system

1216
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,080
that will programmatically publish the shows.

1217
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,120
So that way, when they're finished

1218
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,840
and it goes in the master RSS feed,

1219
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,160
it goes out into all of the various other types of feeds,

1220
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,640
it gets published to the website,

1221
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,800
maybe even eventually completely automating

1222
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,720
the encoding pipeline.

1223
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,880
So Joe drops a WAV file in a folder

1224
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,600
and the next thing you know, videos and MP3s and RSS feeds

1225
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,080
and website posts have all been automatically created.

1226
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,440
And we were kicking around how to solve

1227
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,280
this particular problem for a while.

1228
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,840
Like, is this a series of cron jobs

1229
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,960
that sit around and check RSS feeds?

1230
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:34,480
Is this something that we have like an admin click a button

1231
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,560
and then it executes all of the various tasks

1232
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,240
like from a dashboard?

1233
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,720
And Wes came across a pretty cool project

1234
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,960
that in a sense lets you build your own if this then that,

1235
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,400
but like way more powerful.

1236
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,760
And it's called Hugin,

1237
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,880
at least that's how we're pronouncing it.

1238
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,760
It's, you know, one of those H-U-G-I-N-N.

1239
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,440
So it's kind of a vague, could be Hugin,

1240
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,480
but we really like Hugin

1241
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,880
cause it's like hugging all of our tasks together

1242
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,480
and our agents are on standby.

1243
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,320
It's really a system for building agents

1244
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,200
that perform automated tasks for you online.

1245
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,680
I could read the web, for example,

1246
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,120
it could watch for specific events,

1247
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,400
it can take an action on your behalf

1248
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,600
and agents create and consume events,

1249
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,760
which then propagate them along a directed graph.

1250
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,640
So think of it as a hackable version of Zapier

1251
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,040
or if this and that, that you run on your own server

1252
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,080
and Wes has set it up to publish shows automatically.

1253
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,720
And you wrote some custom code in there and things like that,

1254
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,560
but I don't know Wes,

1255
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,000
just kind of wanted to have you share your thoughts

1256
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,920
with the class on Hugin and building something like this

1257
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,440
and why this versus why not just a series of cron jobs?

1258
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,480
You know, that's a really good question and it's one

1259
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,040
of these tasks that's sort of trivial enough

1260
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,040
that probably anything can work.

1261
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,680
It could be an entirely custom application.

1262
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,880
It could be a series of cron jobs

1263
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,040
that pass just arbitrary text files or JSON blobs around.

1264
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,360
Some of the things I liked about Hugin, Hugin,

1265
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,480
whatever you want to call it,

1266
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,920
I will say it's based off of Norse mythology.

1267
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,600
Hugin and Munin are two ravens that sit on Odin's shoulders.

1268
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,200
Yeah, there you go.

1269
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,240
But I really like Hugin

1270
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,200
because it's like bringing all of our tasks together.

1271
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,160
You know, it's hugging it out.

1272
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,000
Yeah, exactly.

1273
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,480
Hugin, I guess is the official pronunciation.

1274
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,680
It makes sense and they, if you dig in here, look,

1275
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,400
they even have a picture illustration.

1276
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,080
So I guess that's pretty clear.

1277
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,760
Yeah, that is pretty, that is pretty clear.

1278
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,680
The parts I really liked about it was that it did have

1279
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,160
a decently fleshed out event model for you.

1280
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,640
And it has a lot of things that we wanted to use already.

1281
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,840
So things like Slack integrations

1282
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,960
or a whole bunch of other stuff, right?

1283
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,720
They've got Mattermost, a lot of other agents,

1284
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,280
things to automatically follow RSS feeds.

1285
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,600
And while I'm not always a huge Ruby fan

1286
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,160
for a variety of reasons,

1287
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:44,640
the project has done a good job

1288
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,240
of packaging things up pretty nicely.

1289
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,320
They've got multiple Docker files already just ready to go,

1290
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,840
easy to change, easy to customize if you need to.

1291
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,560
And if you wanna write a new plugin,

1292
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,040
well, you just make a new Ruby gem,

1293
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,320
load it on up and away you go.

1294
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,840
And because it has a pretty flexible event system

1295
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,680
already tied up with this directed graph,

1296
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,440
which is probably honestly what I would end up implementing

1297
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,280
if I was gonna write this all myself

1298
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,080
without all the nice UI and the extensibility on top.

1299
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,640
So it was kind of pre-plugged.

1300
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,480
Now, it doesn't do everything we want it to do,

1301
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,960
that was kind of a hassle,

1302
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,920
but because all we have to do is write a gem

1303
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,960
to say, you know, update so that we can work

1304
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,080
with one of the partners that we use to re-host our feeds,

1305
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,080
or we're working on a plugin right now

1306
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,720
to go do better video encoding

1307
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,200
and manage some of our uploads for us,

1308
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,880
that's all easy to do.

1309
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,760
All it has to do is consume and emit these events,

1310
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,760
which you can kind of think of as just sort of JSON blobs,

1311
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,240
arbitrary lists and maps.

1312
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,000
You know, you had some custom code in there

1313
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
to like properly parse the feeds

1314
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,600
and get like the episode title information

1315
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,120
so you could repurpose it for other things.

1316
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,680
But one of the things you're able to do,

1317
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,280
which is really cool,

1318
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,440
is I now can go to the dashboard,

1319
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,280
the webpage that we have.

1320
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,080
We've hosted this on one of our droplets.

1321
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,760
I log in and I can see all of the agents,

1322
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,480
which are essentially the things that are like monitoring

1323
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,000
the different show feeds and whatnot.

1324
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,280
And the thing that's cool

1325
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,760
is some of the parameters are changeable.

1326
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,680
Like they're all broken out and there's a clear spot

1327
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,480
where I can change some of the settings.

1328
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,840
Like I can set it to a test publish

1329
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,000
instead of a live publish.

1330
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,080
I could change a few parameters

1331
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,880
that Wes has been able to call out specifically for the user

1332
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,280
and it gives it a specific area in the GUI

1333
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,200
for me to see those changeable variables essentially.

1334
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,160
Right, that's a nice thing.

1335
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,320
I don't have to make some custom UI here

1336
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,240
or, you know, have a config file

1337
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,320
that's easy for regular humans to understand.

1338
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,560
Now, of course you can go do all of that if you want to,

1339
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,760
but Hugin's got a pretty decent UI right on top

1340
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,640
and they have this concept of like options.

1341
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,360
So for any plugin that you write,

1342
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,920
you can expose user facing options.

1343
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,120
They can customize it, they can load custom data.

1344
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,120
Some of the places we post shows, for instance,

1345
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,880
have a lot of weird oddities.

1346
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,840
None of the names are exactly the same pattern.

1347
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,800
So each one has to be custom.

1348
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,840
Instead of me having to pre-program that into the plugin,

1349
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,800
I can just let the user enter that in

1350
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,840
once they use my plugin.

1351
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,120
So it makes it a lot more extensible

1352
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,880
and a lot more reusable.

1353
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,160
The way you've set it up is it's ingesting

1354
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,400
from the RSS feed, then it's making decisions

1355
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,800
based on the show, and then triggering other events,

1356
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,080
which then sort of go through the same process.

1357
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,160
And for us, it also then gives us a spot

1358
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,240
to audit what's happened.

1359
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,600
So one of the things about building an automated system

1360
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,520
is, especially when you're just building your own scripts,

1361
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,200
is you're maybe not as inclined to really put in

1362
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,480
a ton of logging in your own Bash script or whatever.

1363
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,520
So this system has pretty extensive logging built in.

1364
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,920
So if something doesn't successfully publish

1365
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,920
or there's an error somewhere in the process,

1366
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,480
it's fairly straightforward for us to track that down.

1367
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,960
Yeah, it kind of seemed to be just enough structure

1368
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,240
because it's not a huge project.

1369
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,360
It's not going to do every single thing for GB,

1370
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,800
but I think there will be a few odds and ends,

1371
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,000
probably a number of ones that we can throw in here.

1372
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,360
But it wasn't as big.

1373
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,520
It's not like, it's not Jenkins and it's not Rundeck.

1374
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,400
Those are both good tools, but for the things we wanted,

1375
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,760
we didn't, we're not using it to build software.

1376
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,880
We don't have a lot of complicated, stateful stuff.

1377
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,280
It's really just chaining things together.

1378
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,680
Right, I mean, there's going to be times

1379
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:06,760
where this thing's just kicking off a Bash script

1380
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,040
to do a bunch of work on the backend

1381
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,160
where maybe something more complicated is happening.

1382
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,760
But we can trigger that based on a previous event,

1383
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,320
which is where Hugin will come in.

1384
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,080
Yeah, the other nice part is they have decently fleshed out

1385
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,760
just arbitrary sort of web request plugins

1386
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,880
as well as connections so you can do pushes to Hugin.

1387
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,800
So you can stand a server up there,

1388
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,080
get a HTTP push of things that you want

1389
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,560
and then spawn other events from there.

1390
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,840
So pretty flexible, yeah.

1391
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,320
Hey Wes, I have a question for you.

1392
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:33,960
Yeah, oh yeah, Brent.

1393
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,840
How do you feel about the future proof of this system?

1394
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,280
I know you've put a lot of work into it,

1395
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,520
but how long do you think it'll be useful to JB?

1396
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:43,360
You know, that's a good question.

1397
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,560
That is something I've been thinking about.

1398
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,520
Part of the hopes was that with the developed UI,

1399
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,240
I mean, next time JB launches the next exciting JB show,

1400
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,480
stay tuned everyone, then it'll be easy.

1401
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,960
It won't have to be me that's involved.

1402
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,240
It'd be straightforward enough

1403
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,240
that someone else on the network,

1404
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,800
someone involved or just administrative staff

1405
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,960
or whatever the case may be, could go in and update it.

1406
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,240
Yeah, that's the nice part.

1407
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:09,480
That is really, you define events for a show

1408
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,600
and then those are exportable

1409
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,400
and we can re-import them, change the names

1410
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,840
to protect the innocent and in a sense duplicate the work

1411
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,080
and it doesn't have to be Wes creating a bunch

1412
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,520
of custom code for a new app for a new show.

1413
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,640
Yeah, exactly.

1414
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,800
The other thing is it's been relatively active,

1415
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,720
not super active, but relatively active

1416
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,120
and it's not that complicated.

1417
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,240
One thing I do like to audit for things like this

1418
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,200
is can I grok the source code?

1419
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,200
Can I scroll through it and figure out at least

1420
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,880
the high level of what's going on?

1421
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,240
Oh, here's the piece I need to go.

1422
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,000
Here's the piece over there that I need to find.

1423
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,160
And in this case, yes.

1424
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,920
So even if it stagnates terribly

1425
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,000
and no new features get developed,

1426
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I think we can still use it.

1427
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,520
It's already packaged up in a nice little Docker file

1428
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,200
and it's really just a bunch of Ruby dependencies.

1429
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,320
So as long as those don't have

1430
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,720
super major breaking API changes, we'll be fine.

1431
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,200
The other thing is we're just using it internally.

1432
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,920
So it won't have any like regular user interface.

1433
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,240
So we can go up on the security on that side,

1434
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,080
make sure that only the people that need to have access

1435
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,400
have access to it.

1436
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,000
And then even if we do have an old dependency,

1437
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,480
well, I'm less worried about it.

1438
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:13,920
Looks like some minor stuff in the documentation

1439
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,120
was updated six days ago.

1440
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,920
So it's not under heavy development,

1441
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,240
but the team is still alive

1442
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,040
or the individual, whoever's behind it,

1443
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:24,320
is DS and or is still active.

1444
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,280
So that's part one.

1445
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:30,320
So that's a Hugin or Hugin or Hogan or Hogan's heroes,

1446
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,160
whatever you wanna call it.

1447
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,040
That's the open source by default that we went with,

1448
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:35,520
but now to make it really hip and modern

1449
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,080
and actually for a very practical reason,

1450
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,400
it's all packaged up inside a container.

1451
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,920
So we have it running on the Fedora 29 host

1452
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,040
that I've talked about just on the last episode.

1453
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,360
And it is now one of the containers on this box.

1454
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,480
Why did we go with a Docker container, Wes?

1455
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,840
I mean, we could have just installed it

1456
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,880
on the Fedora machine.

1457
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,520
You know, we definitely could have,

1458
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,520
but it meant that we get to skip

1459
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,760
a lot of the little details.

1460
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,120
For one, the main Docker container it's based on

1461
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,360
and a lot of the developer environment

1462
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,520
seems to be on Ubuntu.

1463
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,200
Now that's not a huge deal

1464
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,280
and we could certainly bootstrap all the gems

1465
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,240
that we needed right there on the Fedora host.

1466
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,960
But with the Docker workflow,

1467
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,280
you get a lot of nice things, right?

1468
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,200
So we can have, right now we have our own fork

1469
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,040
of the project.

1470
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,320
Later we'll be pushing everything upstream

1471
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:21,080
as we solidify on design choices and et cetera.

1472
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,240
And that means when I'm ready to,

1473
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,200
I can just go build a new Docker container,

1474
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,080
push it over to our server,

1475
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,360
reload with the new container.

1476
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:30,360
It's got a separate database kept off somewhere else

1477
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,520
statefully on the machine.

1478
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,920
So we don't have to worry about that.

1479
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,160
Reload the container and the latest released,

1480
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,760
all the changes are right there.

1481
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,600
I know that there's no weird local state that,

1482
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,120
you know, you edited something and forgot to change it

1483
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,400
or I didn't notify you about changing something

1484
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,720
because it always builds fresh.

1485
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,960
It always comes from our Docker source.

1486
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,000
Yeah, that's pretty neat

1487
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,200
because the other part of that is down the road,

1488
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,040
it could be deployed to a laptop.

1489
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,840
So when I'm on the road, I'm offline.

1490
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,640
I could in theory have the entire automation

1491
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,560
and encoding system in a container on my laptop.

1492
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,000
That would be the same exact one

1493
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,160
that we run on our production server.

1494
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,120
And that's pretty neat

1495
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:08,880
because you can start to modularize that a little bit.

1496
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,200
So say we later add video components to this.

1497
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,880
Well, video encoding could be its own container

1498
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,240
that perhaps while I'm on the road is unnecessary.

1499
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,680
I won't be doing any video jobs.

1500
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,000
So I don't need the video encoding container.

1501
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,480
But on the server, you would deploy

1502
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,800
both the main Hugin container and the video container

1503
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,440
so that we could do all the jobs.

1504
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,440
And that modularity and that flexibility is pretty sweet.

1505
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,200
And by having it all tied back upstream,

1506
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,280
that means that we're always, when we're deploying,

1507
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,040
we're always deploying the same consistent image

1508
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,800
to both my production laptop and the production server.

1509
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,560
Yeah, and Hugin has some pretty good support

1510
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,680
for both dry runs and injecting manual events.

1511
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,200
So even if you're in a case where like you were,

1512
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,560
you wanted to run it yourself, you had a one-off,

1513
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,400
you just did a special,

1514
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,560
and telling the JB audience about a cool new project

1515
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:55,000
you were working on or you had a neat little vlog post

1516
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,720
that you decided to get back into doing,

1517
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,920
you release that to the stream,

1518
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,880
you could do it all locally

1519
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,160
and you wouldn't have to jumpstart,

1520
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,200
you wouldn't have to make sure

1521
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,920
you have all the webhooks wired up correctly.

1522
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,840
You could just inject a manual event,

1523
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,040
push it through the system.

1524
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,720
Yeah, isn't that, it's just so neat.

1525
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,040
It's gonna be so neat.

1526
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,080
And if we can down the road,

1527
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,680
like we may even just publish the container up on Docker Hub.

1528
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,720
So if you wanna do the same

1529
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,560
and you wanna use our encoding and publishing system,

1530
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,440
you'd have to change the configs and stuff.

1531
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,840
And we have to go through and make sure

1532
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,160
that we don't have anything embarrassing

1533
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,120
in there like our passwords.

1534
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,040
But we've actually been trying to build it

1535
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,280
from the beginning in a way where we could always do that.

1536
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,560
So we have in mind, we just have to double check.

1537
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:33,760
And the idea could be,

1538
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,480
I mean, one day what we're gonna try to get to

1539
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,400
is you have everything you need

1540
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:43,520
to really get one Linux box or a fleet of Linux boxes

1541
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,840
as a podcast production system.

1542
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,480
Because when you combine from two episodes ago

1543
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,560
when we released our get jacked scripts,

1544
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:52,000
which I used today even to do this show,

1545
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,440
I just use those scripts that we've released as open source

1546
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,720
to completely pre-configure my jack environment

1547
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,040
and route all my audio.

1548
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,840
And I'm sitting here talking to you right now

1549
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:04,040
from a laptop that really is,

1550
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,920
it's amazing how quiet and well-performing it is

1551
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,280
when you consider it's an entire studio

1552
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,400
being routed inside my machine right now

1553
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,120
with multiple ins and outs and physical hardware

1554
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,680
and software sound devices

1555
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,800
and multiple applications that are feeding it.

1556
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,080
And we released all of that as open source.

1557
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,040
And there is hopefully going to eventually be

1558
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,240
sort of this complete picture

1559
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,080
where the setting up of the machine,

1560
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,400
the publishing of the podcast,

1561
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,400
the encoding of the podcast,

1562
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,680
more and more will become just,

1563
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,240
as we expand our process, will become open source

1564
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,720
that people could use to start their own podcasts.

1565
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:41,520
And then eventually we'll get into actual hardware

1566
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,040
and that'll be just documentation that we do.

1567
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,880
But that's all down the road and stuff

1568
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,680
that I won't even fully commit to yet

1569
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,040
because we have also big ambitious show goals.

1570
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,400
But the idea, hopefully we'll be able to,

1571
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,080
the more we can automate with this system,

1572
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,000
the more time we have to work on open sourcing

1573
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,320
and building the rest of that stuff.

1574
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,600
That's the idea is, just for those of you

1575
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,360
that are curious what kind of change this makes

1576
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,360
for us in-house, is last time I tracked it,

1577
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,800
and this may actually have increased since then,

1578
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,440
is it's 175 individual steps that a human being,

1579
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,680
actions that a human being must take to publish an episode.

1580
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,920
You figure we got one or two sometimes going out a day.

1581
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,040
And that's not even the editing, right?

1582
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,440
That's just from the edited final WAV file

1583
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,160
to pushing it out to all you guys.

1584
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:29,560
Best time, mind you, that I've been doing this

1585
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,720
for about 12 years.

1586
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,880
My best time is usually about 22 minutes

1587
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,040
to get an episode published.

1588
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,600
And that's if I pre-stage things,

1589
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,480
like I pre-stage all my tabs.

1590
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,160
I have it down to a science.

1591
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,160
Like I know, I have the WordPress install so well,

1592
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,160
I know it so well that I know like what things

1593
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,880
take a while to load, so I go to the other tab,

1594
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,240
and I take an action in that tab,

1595
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,400
and I know how long that takes to load,

1596
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,200
so I switch back to another tab, and then I do the,

1597
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,280
I mean, I'm telling you, there's no downtime here.

1598
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,800
Everything's preloaded, the artwork's done,

1599
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,920
everything's ready to go, and it's still 22 minutes

1600
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,960
is like my best time.

1601
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,320
And that's after doing it for 12 years.

1602
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,200
And so it's about 175 actions.

1603
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,480
I haven't counted for a while because it's so tedious.

1604
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,600
So that is huge because that takes up a part of my day

1605
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,000
every day, a part of Angela's day every day.

1606
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,880
And it also means frequently that people are sitting

1607
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,360
around waiting for episodes to get published.

1608
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,320
And it's just a matter of like the show's done,

1609
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,840
but nobody's awake to push all 175 buttons.

1610
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:27,600
And it's just manual labor because until now

1611
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,280
wasn't a really clear way to tie it all together.

1612
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:33,480
And that's where Hogan, or Hogan's Heroes,

1613
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,520
has really come in and given us sort of this cohesive piece

1614
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:40,200
that we can build off of to tie all of these things together.

1615
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,080
And we're just beginning, and we're trying to build it

1616
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,560
in a way where we can share it with everybody,

1617
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,320
but we wanted to give you sort of a bit of an update

1618
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,600
so that way as we come across a couple of open source tools

1619
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,920
that just are like, holy crap,

1620
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,280
this is gonna be such a game changer for us,

1621
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,360
like gotta share it with you guys.

1622
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,720
Because maybe if you just want to monitor the weather

1623
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:00,360
and have it trigger an event, this will do that.

1624
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,880
Like it doesn't have to be like you're trying

1625
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,920
to publish podcasts, like it's,

1626
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,520
there's all kinds of things you could use it for.

1627
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,720
So we'll have a link to it in the show notes.

1628
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,560
I'm gonna go check it out.

1629
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,680
And also, we'll have a link in the show notes

1630
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,240
to our submission, I guess it's a Google form?

1631
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:16,480
I don't know what they call these things.

1632
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,400
Goes into a sheet, and it's a,

1633
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,880
we're trying to collect suggestions

1634
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,040
for what to name the entire system when we're all done,

1635
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,320
because Hogan is just part of it.

1636
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,040
There's other components to it.

1637
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,920
And we want to just have a name so we can say,

1638
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,800
go get the latest version of,

1639
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,120
and it will be encompassing of the entire thing.

1640
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,440
And we've gotten a bunch of really funny submissions,

1641
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,760
really good ones so far, and some great like,

1642
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,280
ones that I'm surprised, I just didn't think of,

1643
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,720
like there's some really obvious ones in there,

1644
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,920
but there's a whole range.

1645
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,200
And what we're gonna do is we're gonna try

1646
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,040
to distill it down to like four or five of them,

1647
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,360
and then open it up to a vote.

1648
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:49,560
And then the community will name our new baby.

1649
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,120
So find the link in the show notes

1650
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,600
at linuxunplugged.com slash 274,

1651
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,480
and look for the automation naming,

1652
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,960
automation system naming Google Form.

1653
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,480
Mr. Payne, is there anything else we want to mention

1654
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,600
about Hogan there, or Hogan?

1655
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,320
I just think it's kind of new ground we're exploring here.

1656
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,800
So if you have similar systems,

1657
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,600
you have technology you like for automating

1658
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,600
sort of responsive event-driven workflows.

1659
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,040
And to keep in mind that we're not a giant enterprise,

1660
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:18,440
there's gonna be four people who touch this

1661
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,760
for the time being maybe.

1662
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,920
So a tool that's right sized for that,

1663
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,320
I would love to hear about it.

1664
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,320
Yeah, that's a great point.

1665
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,560
There are a lot of tools,

1666
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:29,600
but we need one that's appropriate for our scale.

1667
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,800
Here's a tool for you.

1668
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,720
You know, why not Electron app all the things I always say?

1669
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:35,560
You know, why not?

1670
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:39,640
Like just get 64 gigs of RAM and Electron all the things.

1671
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:40,840
No, here's our app pick for the day.

1672
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,600
I kid, but at the same time, it kind of looks legit.

1673
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,560
It's called CPOD.

1674
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:47,880
It's an open source cross-platform podcast app.

1675
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,000
And yes, as you guessed it, it is Electron,

1676
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,200
but it's FOSS has what I would say

1677
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,680
is the best write up on the internet about this.

1678
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,840
Hands down.

1679
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,680
With some beautiful late night Linux album artwork

1680
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,160
there in the demo screenshot

1681
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,680
and later on some Linux action news

1682
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,720
that may be making me slightly biased towards their post,

1683
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,480
but either way, they do a great write up here.

1684
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:13,480
Simple, clean podcasting app that does a really decent job

1685
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,680
of listing out the podcasts on your computer

1686
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:16,560
and let you listen to them.

1687
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:17,840
It has a dark mode.

1688
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,760
It uses the iTunes podcast directory,

1689
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,320
which a lot of these apps do.

1690
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,680
And it has, of course, all of the essentials like

1691
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,440
the speed up and slow down playback modes,

1692
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:32,560
auto fetching of new episodes, multiple language support,

1693
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,840
all kinds of sorting options.

1694
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,360
But I thought this one was a good one

1695
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:38,080
that I think more apps should implement.

1696
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,400
You can sync your podcast subscriptions with gpodder.net.

1697
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,080
And that right there.

1698
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,480
Yeah, when I saw that, I just, I love that.

1699
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:47,640
I don't listen a lot.

1700
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,800
I'll either use the Pocket Cast web player

1701
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,360
or the Overcast web player if I'm listening on the desktop.

1702
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,480
But you'd be surprised how many times

1703
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,040
we get people writing into the show asking,

1704
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,040
hey, how could I manage podcasts on the desktop?

1705
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,520
There's not like a great, there's like not a clear way.

1706
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,480
So C pod could be one of them.

1707
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,240
It says here in the article that you can snap install C pod.

1708
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,480
I tried to do that and it did not work for me.

1709
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,320
I tried that as well.

1710
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,240
It didn't work great, but I do have it running

1711
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,040
thanks to App Image right here on the studio machines

1712
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:13,880
up on the live stream.

1713
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,720
And it's pretty easy.

1714
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,960
I mean, I've already got, I'm listening to Light Night Linux

1715
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,840
and Linux Action News right now.

1716
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,120
Nice, how's it look?

1717
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,080
Do you think it's a good, I thought it was a good UI.

1718
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:22,920
What do you think?

1719
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:23,760
Oh yeah, it's pretty clear and easy.

1720
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,640
It didn't take me very long to understand.

1721
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:26,480
It has the normal sort of stuff,

1722
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,240
like a place to go find new podcasts.

1723
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,760
And then once you've subscribed,

1724
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,720
a home location where all of your subscribed podcasts

1725
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,360
show up in a sort of feed style.

1726
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,600
Like you'd expect from a podcast app.

1727
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,200
And now you got one for your desktop.

1728
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,720
All of the good luck for them.

1729
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:43,240
Maybe reconsider the name because a search for their name

1730
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:47,040
also shows chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

1731
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,520
Oh no.

1732
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,600
Serious.

1733
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,560
Yeah, all right.

1734
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,520
Well, okay.

1735
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,480
That's my advice.

1736
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,840
All the luck, open source, it's Electron,

1737
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:58,120
but you know, pulmonary disease and Electron.

1738
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,640
I say, why not own it?

1739
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,320
Call it like Electron Potter or something.

1740
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,080
Just own it because in the name,

1741
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,560
it also says it's cross platform.

1742
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,360
So if you've got several desktops of different OSs

1743
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,360
and you want to sync your podcast across all of them.

1744
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:12,680
If somebody had a bad experience with Electron in the past

1745
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,920
and they read Electron and it shouldn't really matter

1746
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,000
what the technology is, if the tool is good, right?

1747
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1748
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:20,760
So check it out.

1749
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,880
We'll have a link in the show notes to its bosses right up.

1750
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,160
So that way you can see the advantages.

1751
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,960
It's also available in many of your local repos,

1752
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,760
surprise, surprise, including the arch user repository.

1753
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,840
I know shocker on that one.

1754
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,600
Didn't see that one coming, did you?

1755
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,280
I thought, I thought though the podcast audience

1756
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,760
might appreciate a podcast app.

1757
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:37,600
So that's up there.

1758
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,040
If you want it linuxunplug.com slash 274, go grab that.

1759
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,480
And if you've got an app pick or a topic suggestion

1760
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,680
or something like that, let us know linuxunplug.com

1761
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,680
slash contact, or you can tweet me.

1762
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,240
I'm at Chris LAS.

1763
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:51,560
Mr. Payne is at West Payne.

1764
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,120
That's Payne with a Y.

1765
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:56,760
And you are more than welcome to come hang out

1766
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,280
in our virtual lug on Tuesdays.

1767
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,160
We do it at 2 p.m. Pacific, which turns out,

1768
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:06,240
turns out it's like 4 p.m. Central time.

1769
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,080
Who knew?

1770
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,160
Nobody knew until I arrived.

1771
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,200
Nobody knew that, no.

1772
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,640
Not a single person in that time zone had figured it out,

1773
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,040
which is, they're lucky they have you.

1774
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,080
Yeah, I know, man.

1775
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,120
If I didn't travel around the world,

1776
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,960
how could I inform people of my wisdoms?

1777
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,800
It's a good thing, it's a good thing.

1778
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,240
And also, it gets converted to your local time

1779
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,840
at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1780
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:28,040
One more plug, go help us name the automation system,

1781
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:29,480
because it's something internally

1782
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,880
that we'll be referring to for the rest of time, likely.

1783
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,240
And it'll be something that we say in meetings.

1784
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,360
It'll be something that we say

1785
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,680
when we're introducing new people to the how we do things.

1786
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,440
It'll be potentially something that people deploy

1787
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,560
on their own systems.

1788
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,640
So help us name this thing.

1789
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,140
And I think what we'll do is we'll leave the votes open

1790
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:50,240
for one more week,

1791
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,840
because I really want to get a name for it.

1792
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,440
I'm very excited about this.

1793
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,040
So we'll probably do one more week or so.

1794
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,800
After that, we'll probably have the vote.

1795
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,360
So if you're listening, say, two, three weeks on delay,

1796
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,760
the vote may already be happening.

1797
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,160
So you might want to check the latest show notes.

1798
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,800
But again, that's linked to at linuxunplug.com slash 274.

1799
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,680
But that wraps us up for this week's episode.

1800
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:10,920
Thanks so much for joining us,

1801
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,160
and we will see you next Tuesday.

1802
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:41,120
Okay, bye guys.

1803
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:49,520
Hey, Chris, I have a question for you.

1804
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,520
Yes, sir.

1805
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:55,040
Today is November 6, and November 7 marks the Dropbox switchover.

1806
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,040
Yeah.

1807
01:07:56,040 --> 01:08:01,840
I just wondered if you had an update and if anyone else had any updates.

1808
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:03,640
Oh, man.

1809
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,040
Turns out Chris has been embracing the ext4 lifestyle.

1810
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,720
He's all about it now.

1811
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:13,200
I have actually loaded a couple, like my new ThinkPad is ext4, just in case I had to kick

1812
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,200
this can for a little bit.

1813
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,200
I got this...

1814
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:22,080
See, here's the problem is I got this network effect going on that has amplified recently.

1815
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:25,600
The crew here at Linux Academy is using Dropbox.

1816
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,560
They use it fairly extensively.

1817
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:32,860
The other problem is that several of the publishing services that we currently use are integrated

1818
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:33,860
with Dropbox.

1819
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:38,840
I actually queue the files up for encoding by moving them to a Dropbox folder, and then

1820
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:43,280
they get uploaded to the service, which then ingests them, and then it outputs the results

1821
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,480
to another Dropbox folder.

1822
01:08:45,480 --> 01:08:47,200
It's pretty integrated right now.

1823
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:56,480
On top of that, I have not been fully happy with any individual replacement for various

1824
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,800
reasons.

1825
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:01,240
For example, Nextcloud is pretty much set now.

1826
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:05,280
I'm pretty happy with Nextcloud, and their mobile app is sufficient where I can upload

1827
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:09,680
images like when I'm at MeetBSD or whatever to start writing a blog.

1828
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,720
That's all working fantastic.

1829
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,680
The web interface has been tops.

1830
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:18,120
The performance is where I want it at now, which has always been my primary complaint

1831
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,120
from years past.

1832
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,280
Performance is where I want it now.

1833
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:23,640
They've got undeletion of files.

1834
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:29,120
Desktop sync integrates beautifully with Plasma Desktop, way better than Dropbox does.

1835
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:34,240
The only issue I have is that, no, it's that network effect.

1836
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:39,280
The performance, I believe, is better with Dropbox still, but they have massive CDNs,

1837
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:46,360
and I'm uploading to a single Droplet, so that doesn't surprise me.

1838
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:53,920
I don't have enough time to admin the storage, and so what happens is I get going on a project,

1839
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:58,800
and I fill up what I've allocated, and my Nextcloud quits working.

1840
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:03,180
I sit down to go to my computer to go into production mode, and my files aren't there,

1841
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:07,160
and that's how I discover, oh yeah, that's right, I did see a critical error message

1842
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,280
pop up, but they happen.

1843
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,280
It's very verbose.

1844
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,680
I get a lot of, your Nextcloud instance needs your attention, critical error.

1845
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,760
I get errors, and then I go there, and there's no error.

1846
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,900
I guess there's one question.

1847
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:22,820
Would it help you, because even though you would probably still want to read the message

1848
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:28,120
at some point, if it just automatically scaled your Droplet?

1849
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:40,120
Maybe, but then I get into a cost range, where it's not really economically, yeah, exactly.

1850
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:46,020
Do you have any other place that you currently have for, you probably do, which is for cold

1851
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,020
storage locally?

1852
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:50,440
Oh yeah, we have a big old Freenaz in the studio.

1853
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:56,240
I can see this as, for your pipeline, there's something that just triggers, if for some

1854
01:10:56,240 --> 01:11:04,600
reason you reach the limit, it scales it for a limit, and then it triggers the other process

1855
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:08,640
to offload from it, because you don't need it there anymore, after all.

1856
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:13,720
You have the cold storage in the mass, and then you're just there.

1857
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:17,680
Actually the Hugin, I would be very interested to see a Hugin doing this, and at least you

1858
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:23,440
can actually not succumb to the proprietary world, Chris, you can do this, I trust you.

1859
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,800
Maybe, there might be a way, it's just, it's very, you know, I've got to build a solution

1860
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,720
to do it, and so that, you have Hugin, that's the whole thing, let's put it to test.

1861
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,960
I would say you have Wes, you have Wes to do it.

1862
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,040
Well, that's what I would do, I'd ask Wes to do it, I would ask Wes to build the Hugin

1863
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,760
connection, and yeah, just R-Sync it for me, Wes, please.

1864
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:45,760
No, I hadn't really, you know, I hadn't really landed on a way to solve that.

1865
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,720
I bet you there'd have to be some reorganization to start offlining stuff, but I bet you there's

1866
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:56,480
a lot of stuff we have in there that could be accessed once a month, once every quarter

1867
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:00,480
even, that could totally be sitting on the free NAS rig.

1868
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:06,120
So yeah, that might be a pretty clever solution to this problem.

1869
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:09,840
I don't know when I would get it done, that's the issue, is I ran up to the deadline now.

1870
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,640
So there's probably machines in the studio that I guess won't sync anymore.

1871
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:17,520
So I got to solve it, I guess when I get back, it's probably one of the things on the top

1872
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,520
of my list.

1873
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,520
Thanks, Brent.

1874
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,960
Well, I have one more little itty-bitty question about that.

1875
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,720
I know a few years ago, you guys were looking, you and Noah were looking at Nextcloud when

1876
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:32,560
I was much younger, and you were running into some file syncing issues with, I think it

1877
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,560
was a large number of files.

1878
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:34,560
Are you seeing any of that now?

1879
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:35,560
Yeah.

1880
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,560
It's not called Nextcloud by then.

1881
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:37,560
Come on.

1882
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:38,560
Homecloud.

1883
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,560
Yeah, back then it was Homecloud.

1884
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,560
Sorry.

1885
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,560
No.

1886
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:47,280
You know, I guess I haven't put like the two or three terabytes that I have in Dropbox

1887
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:53,180
in there, but I've put 100 gigs in there, and I haven't yet had an issue.

1888
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:59,440
The thing that helps a lot is I have been a little more selective about what goes into

1889
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,440
Nextcloud.

1890
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,440
So it's a little more current.

1891
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,440
And so it's...

1892
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,040
I don't know how to put it.

1893
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:07,440
It's not just like I haven't just been doing like big data dumps like we did early on.

1894
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,920
So it's been a little more selective about what goes in there.

1895
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:13,660
So I haven't done like a four gig file that's landed in there.

1896
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:17,320
But the other thing that I really like in Nextcloud that I hadn't played with in the

1897
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:23,720
past, which makes a big difference, is they have an ignored files list that you can use.

1898
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:29,080
And when you go in there and you edit this, you can actually leave out an entire directory.

1899
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:30,320
It's not just individual files.

1900
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:34,160
And so on like my laptop with a small SSD, I just won't even sync those files now, which

1901
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,100
also alleviated the problem a bit.

1902
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,020
Are you thinking about Nextcloud?

1903
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:40,720
So I've been playing with it for the last few weeks, and it's been going really, really

1904
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:41,720
well.

1905
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:45,760
And a few of those questions were at the back of my mind like, hmm, am I getting into a

1906
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:46,760
trap here?

1907
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,640
But so far, it's been quite amazing.

1908
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,560
And I don't generate a huge amount of data.

1909
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:52,560
But there's...

1910
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,160
It's only a trap if you try to consume the content directly through it.

1911
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:56,160
I'm sorry.

1912
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,160
I shouldn't say these things.

1913
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:58,160
It's true.

1914
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:14,680
But it is how it is.

1915
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:19,440
Right?
