WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
I'm somehow full of admiration that you take

00:02.960 --> 00:08.560
thousands of miles with the car just to go to a Linux fest.

00:08.560 --> 00:10.880
Well, and to visit Linux Academy, too.

00:10.880 --> 00:13.160
Well, I don't know.

00:13.160 --> 00:15.720
Sometimes I actually feel like I'm insane.

00:15.720 --> 00:19.840
But at other times, there is something really good for me

00:19.840 --> 00:22.800
because I spend so much time on the computer.

00:22.800 --> 00:27.160
And I'm always working on the internet

00:27.160 --> 00:30.720
that to then be very, very much disconnected

00:30.720 --> 00:33.040
for long periods of time and driving down the road

00:33.040 --> 00:35.160
does do something good for me psychologically, I think.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.040
It's sort of a rebalancing thing for me.

00:37.040 --> 00:37.840
I will be right back.

00:37.840 --> 00:38.880
I'm going to get a beverage.

00:38.880 --> 00:40.200
Grab one for me, too.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.400
Absolutely.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.640
So we were coming down into Texas last night.

00:44.640 --> 00:45.760
We hadn't quite made it yet.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.120
We were still in New Mexico.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.520
And it was about 100 degrees out.

00:49.520 --> 00:53.160
And I got the high temperature alarm on one of my rear tires.

00:53.160 --> 00:56.240
So I have four rear tires, two sets of Duallys in the back.

00:56.240 --> 01:00.640
And one of them got to 124 degrees, which is pretty high.

01:00.640 --> 01:03.880
It's not super crazy high, but that's pretty dang high.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.040
And so that was the first time during this trip

01:06.040 --> 01:07.920
where we pulled over and just sat for a while

01:07.920 --> 01:09.440
while our tires cooled down.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.120
And it was towards the end of the night, too.

01:11.120 --> 01:12.720
So by the time we got back on the road,

01:12.720 --> 01:15.120
the sun was setting, and it dropped about 80 degrees.

01:15.120 --> 01:17.200
And the tires stayed fine for the rest of the trip.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.560
But there was a moment there where I went, oh, crap.

01:19.560 --> 01:23.360
And the thing that was wild about it

01:23.360 --> 01:29.440
is just 45 seconds before I passed a Class A RV

01:29.440 --> 01:31.360
on the side of the road with a blown tire.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.840
Their tire, something had gone wrong, and their tire blew out.

01:33.840 --> 01:36.480
And then not even a minute later,

01:36.480 --> 01:39.000
my alarm goes off for one of my tires.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.400
And I was like, I'm not even going to mess around with this.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.120
So I pulled over on the side of the highway.

01:43.120 --> 01:45.440
Lots of big trucks going by because it was a real big

01:45.440 --> 01:46.440
commercial corridor.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.440
So they're shaking the whole RV as they go by.

01:48.440 --> 01:51.120
And we just sat there for about 40 minutes

01:51.120 --> 01:52.920
while the tire cooled down.

01:52.920 --> 01:55.200
That was the first moment where I was like,

01:55.200 --> 01:57.440
maybe this is a little stupid.

01:57.440 --> 01:58.560
This is a little dumb.

01:58.560 --> 01:59.840
Maybe I shouldn't be doing this because it's always

01:59.840 --> 02:01.720
a bigger push than you expect.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.880
But at the end of it, I get to go down there.

02:03.880 --> 02:06.240
I get to hang out with audience members,

02:06.240 --> 02:08.080
and I get to go do Linux stuff.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.720
And then I just get to go home.

02:09.720 --> 02:13.520
And I just live in Austin for about a week.

02:13.520 --> 02:17.360
And then that's kind of a unique opportunity.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.840
So how could I say no?

02:18.840 --> 02:20.320
All ready, all ready.

02:20.320 --> 02:21.200
Did you get that beer?

02:21.200 --> 02:22.320
Yes, I did.

02:22.320 --> 02:23.480
I'm ready to go.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.640
Well, let's start the show.

02:25.640 --> 02:41.560
This is Linux Unplugged episode 252 for June 5, 2018.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.480
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

02:44.480 --> 02:46.600
that's definitely the hot box sauna edition.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.680
My name is Chris.

02:47.680 --> 02:48.760
My name is Wes.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.040
Hello, Wes.

02:50.040 --> 02:55.000
I'm chatting to you from Plainview, Texas this week.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.880
And we have got a huge show.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.720
Microsoft helped this week by buying GitHub.

02:59.720 --> 03:03.600
We'll talk about Microsoft's $7.5 billion acquisition

03:03.600 --> 03:04.600
of GitHub.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.560
We'll talk about Nat Friedman, who he is,

03:06.560 --> 03:08.920
and why you might want to know more

03:08.920 --> 03:10.840
about him in the next few months.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.520
And then we're going to talk about what happens to Adam now

03:13.520 --> 03:19.160
that Google, or no, I mean Microsoft owns GitHub, which

03:19.160 --> 03:22.080
owns Adam, which competes with Visual Studio Code.

03:22.080 --> 03:22.760
It's a mess.

03:22.760 --> 03:23.920
We'll talk about that.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.720
And then we'll get into some project news,

03:25.720 --> 03:28.080
including some news around KWin, the Linux

03:28.080 --> 03:30.760
subsystem that's going to be on Chromebooks,

03:30.760 --> 03:33.360
and something big for Nextcloud.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.560
It's a huge, huge moment today for Nextcloud.

03:35.560 --> 03:36.680
We'll tell you about that.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.800
And then the most app picks we've ever had on the show.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.480
It's an app pick blowout.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.000
We've got so many app picks, you're

03:43.000 --> 03:44.880
going to need tabs for days.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.080
There's probably something in here for everybody.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.760
And then, at the end of the show,

03:49.760 --> 03:52.640
after we let all of this soak for a bit,

03:52.640 --> 03:55.920
after we marinate in Microsoft's purchase,

03:55.920 --> 03:59.320
now that Microsoft is going to own Electron,

03:59.320 --> 04:01.080
how can Microsoft make it better?

04:01.080 --> 04:02.080
What could they do?

04:02.080 --> 04:04.600
Let's just say things work out, and they

04:04.600 --> 04:07.160
are able to steward Electron into a direction that

04:07.160 --> 04:09.040
improves it for everyone.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.080
That could happen.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.160
We'll have to wait and see.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.680
And I'll get the Mumble Room suggestions, my suggestions,

04:13.680 --> 04:15.080
and Wes's suggestions.

04:15.080 --> 04:18.200
So that way, we can maybe, maybe come up

04:18.200 --> 04:19.840
with something good out of all of this.

04:19.840 --> 04:23.400
Because Electron is getting a lot of deployment

04:23.400 --> 04:25.920
on Linux desktops these days, and now Microsoft owns it.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.720
So I think that's definitely worth discussing.

04:27.720 --> 04:30.560
But before we go any further, let's bring in that Mumble Room.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.560
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

04:32.560 --> 04:33.760
What's up?

04:33.760 --> 04:34.680
Oh, hey.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.360
Hey, oh.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.960
Oh, hey, indeed.

04:37.960 --> 04:42.360
Well, what's up is that it's like 100 degrees in this room

04:42.360 --> 04:43.360
right now.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.160
That's what's up.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.200
That was expected.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.840
We won't complain too much.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.400
Wes, I don't know really where to start.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.360
I'm not quite ready to get into the GitHub stuff

04:50.360 --> 04:51.720
yet, because it's just such a big story.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.120
I feel like it's a big story.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.160
We should warm up with something.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.800
Like, you and I do this on the TechSnap program

04:55.800 --> 04:58.560
as we have these warm-up stories to kind of get us rolling.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.920
And I've kind of set one aside this week that's

05:00.920 --> 05:03.800
not super Linux-specific, but it is kind of mind-blowing

05:03.800 --> 05:04.880
where all this stuff is going.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.080
And the core tech runs on Linux.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.400
It's from Facebook.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.120
And it's their FAIR system, which

05:10.120 --> 05:12.000
is the Facebook AI Research.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.440
And their scientists yesterday unveiled a neural network

05:15.440 --> 05:18.600
capable of translating music from one style and genre

05:18.600 --> 05:21.240
and a set of instruments to another.

05:21.240 --> 05:26.320
So you take something that starts out with like Bach.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.800
And it's one of his symphonies.

05:27.800 --> 05:28.960
And it's symphonies.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.280
And he's playing.

05:30.280 --> 05:35.920
And the AI can translate that into a song played

05:35.920 --> 05:40.160
on a piano in the style of Beethoven, for example.

05:40.160 --> 05:42.400
So you can actually just, in a way,

05:42.400 --> 05:45.480
translate the music from one set of instruments and styles

05:45.480 --> 05:46.360
to another.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.840
And FAIR becomes the first AI research team

05:48.840 --> 05:51.080
to create a unsupervised learning method

05:51.080 --> 05:53.120
to actually do all of this.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.120
Their results are kind of mind-blowing.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.080
And they're sort of patting themselves

05:59.080 --> 06:02.640
on the back this week because it's huge for the AI industry.

06:02.640 --> 06:04.040
If you think about it, it's something

06:04.040 --> 06:08.400
that a music professional could probably do fairly competently.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.440
But now you have AI doing it.

06:10.440 --> 06:13.520
And their approach involves a complex method

06:13.520 --> 06:16.680
of auto-encoding that allows the network to process audio

06:16.680 --> 06:18.680
from inputs it's never been trained on.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.640
Rather than trying to match pitch or memorize notes,

06:21.640 --> 06:23.120
this unsupervised learning method

06:23.120 --> 06:26.280
uses high-level semantic interpretation.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.760
I guess another way to put this is you could say it's listening

06:28.760 --> 06:30.200
and it plays it by ear.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.400
Right, exactly.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.560
It's kind of crazy in that respect.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.920
That's kind of one of the fun aspects of some of these AI

06:35.920 --> 06:37.560
projects is just where they interface

06:37.560 --> 06:39.520
with things that are traditionally so human,

06:39.520 --> 06:41.600
like art, and how we interpret that,

06:41.600 --> 06:44.640
and then trying to reason about how they, you know,

06:44.640 --> 06:47.360
to quote unquote, understand it.

06:47.360 --> 06:50.080
Giving computers the ability to see and the ability to hear

06:50.080 --> 06:54.080
and then make decisions based on that is the fundamentals.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.160
And they're very excited about the progress they're making.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.440
I, on the other hand, am a little apprehensive,

06:59.440 --> 07:02.160
just like I am with Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub

07:02.160 --> 07:03.840
for 7.5 Billy.

07:03.840 --> 07:07.880
Now, that's in stock, so it's maybe less impressive.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.760
No, that's still, that's, yep, just checked.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.160
Still impressive, still absolutely impressive.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.480
And today is the day after, the day

07:14.480 --> 07:15.880
after we got the official news.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.120
It was brewing all weekend.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.960
They announced it yesterday, Monday, Tuesday, the 5th

07:20.960 --> 07:24.160
of June, 2018, is the second day after this announcement.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.760
And we've already learned new details

07:25.760 --> 07:27.520
that we didn't know yesterday.

07:27.520 --> 07:30.360
So the first thing is that they, I think,

07:30.360 --> 07:32.160
the biggest thing that we learned today

07:32.160 --> 07:36.080
is that Google was hot on the tail for this.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.960
There was a bidding war between Microsoft and Google

07:38.960 --> 07:40.240
for GitHub.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.720
So think about that for a second.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.240
Just that information right there, Wes,

07:44.240 --> 07:46.240
how would you feel if yesterday was announced

07:46.240 --> 07:47.080
Google bought GitHub?

07:47.080 --> 07:47.920
You know, I don't know.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.320
It's kind of complicated.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.160
Both are sort of gray areas.

07:53.160 --> 07:56.880
I might actually be happier with Microsoft buying them.

07:56.880 --> 08:00.040
That feels weird to say, but if someone had to,

08:00.040 --> 08:01.560
it could have been worse, I think.

08:01.560 --> 08:02.400
No.

08:02.400 --> 08:06.160
I can even give you the reason why Microsoft or anybody wants

08:06.160 --> 08:06.960
it.

08:06.960 --> 08:11.240
And it's to do with search for code references.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.960
Microsoft, a couple of years ago,

08:12.960 --> 08:15.120
you guys reported in here, I think,

08:15.120 --> 08:19.600
a tool that allowed you to search for actual solution

08:19.600 --> 08:20.880
snippets.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.560
And Microsoft wants that.

08:22.560 --> 08:24.640
And Google wants that, too.

08:24.640 --> 08:27.120
It also gives developers for their infrastructure,

08:27.120 --> 08:29.800
which is looking for developers.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.760
Looking for developers, so those are the reasons.

08:32.760 --> 08:37.640
I don't think anybody would have been a better buyer

08:37.640 --> 08:38.960
than anybody else.

08:38.960 --> 08:43.240
They are all terrible because the reasons they want it is.

08:43.240 --> 08:47.960
No, seriously, I think GitHub, if a foundation was made out

08:47.960 --> 08:50.120
of it, it would be great.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.320
But somebody buying it, there's nobody

08:52.320 --> 08:54.600
that's going to buy a business which

08:54.600 --> 08:58.000
is founded on selling storage.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.680
That's what GitHub is.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.200
So, Dar, what do you think, though?

09:01.200 --> 09:03.560
If you were going to have to pick between Microsoft

09:03.560 --> 09:07.640
or Google, as far as open source projects go,

09:07.640 --> 09:09.600
which one are you more comfortable with?

09:09.600 --> 09:11.280
I would say Google, I guess.

09:11.280 --> 09:12.800
And the reason for that would have

09:12.800 --> 09:15.440
been just because Google at least has a legitimate reason.

09:15.440 --> 09:20.800
Also, aside from demining your code as data,

09:20.800 --> 09:24.400
reason, which is code.google.com failed.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.280
It was terrible.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.480
It closed.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.640
So they need a replacement.

09:27.640 --> 09:28.640
It wouldn't make sense.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.920
Microsoft, they kind of have this whole tooling.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.120
They're going to change GitHub.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.320
It's going to be worse.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.160
Yes, it would be cool if it was a foundation,

09:36.160 --> 09:37.960
but that was never going to happen.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.320
They've always been maybe not actually making

09:40.320 --> 09:43.200
a bunch of money, but attempting to be a for-profit company.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.240
GitHub is convenient.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.680
I have no love lost.

09:45.680 --> 09:48.360
So it really just seems more like business to me

09:48.360 --> 09:49.440
than anything else.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.520
And maybe it means we reevaluate it.

09:51.520 --> 09:52.280
But that's exactly.

09:52.280 --> 09:54.680
Google would have probably kept this convenient

09:54.680 --> 09:58.120
if they only bought it for the code.google replacement thing,

09:58.120 --> 10:00.160
because that's what they had with code.google.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.680
It was just sitting there, and people could use it.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.480
It was a back burner that they didn't mind.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.720
Yeah, that also means it wasted away.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.680
I think Microsoft will probably be a much more active

10:08.680 --> 10:10.280
and probably better steward.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.040
They have been doing a lot of Git things.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.760
I think they actually care about Git.

10:13.760 --> 10:15.720
There's obviously other reasons for this acquisition,

10:15.720 --> 10:17.680
but their developers are already using it.

10:17.680 --> 10:19.480
They're one of the largest open source contributors

10:19.480 --> 10:21.880
on the platform, so I think it's in their own interest

10:21.880 --> 10:23.560
to actually make it work pretty well.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.080
What that actually means is now you're

10:25.080 --> 10:29.760
going to be filled with Microsoft products all over,

10:29.760 --> 10:32.640
and Git will change to accommodate the Microsoft tool

10:32.640 --> 10:36.400
chain, which means that if you love GitHub right now,

10:36.400 --> 10:39.120
it might not be as pretty in that future

10:39.120 --> 10:42.800
when it's connecting with all of the tools you don't use.

10:42.800 --> 10:47.120
I think that's definitely a likely possibility for sure.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.760
So Nat Friedman, who's going to be running it,

10:49.760 --> 10:53.000
said that they're going to remain an independent entity,

10:53.000 --> 10:54.800
sort of like how LinkedIn has.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.440
We'll see if that's going to be true.

10:56.440 --> 10:58.640
Even find that there's another problem

10:58.640 --> 11:02.120
with this whole situation, which these big corporations are

11:02.120 --> 11:04.680
compliancy.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.600
They're full compliant.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.400
And remember the takedowns that GitHub had?

11:09.400 --> 11:11.440
Expect more of those.

11:11.440 --> 11:14.160
Oh, and by the way, in the future,

11:14.160 --> 11:16.560
we probably don't need certain governments

11:16.560 --> 11:17.800
to develop Stuxnet.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.400
They can just inject in normal daily software

11:20.400 --> 11:22.280
because they have control of the repos

11:22.280 --> 11:24.560
and who gets to see the code in the first place.

11:24.560 --> 11:26.280
So you're building from source?

11:26.280 --> 11:27.120
Who cares?

11:27.120 --> 11:31.400
So I think what we have here is grounds for serious concern.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.440
But we don't have anything that's

11:33.440 --> 11:35.880
even going to really change for probably another six

11:35.880 --> 11:36.560
months or so.

11:36.560 --> 11:40.320
The deal isn't finished until, at best, the end of the year.

11:40.320 --> 11:43.680
And then at the end of the year, Nat Friedman takes over.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.960
And he's been an open source since the 90s.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.280
He writes on his blog, he says, I

11:48.280 --> 11:51.120
was blown away to discover a free operating system that

11:51.120 --> 11:53.960
came with an editor, a compiler, and a debugger.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.560
All of the tools you need to be a developer and all

11:56.560 --> 11:59.200
of the source code, it was an incredible opportunity

11:59.200 --> 12:01.280
for a teenager in a small town in Virginia

12:01.280 --> 12:04.200
to learn from the best developers in the world,

12:04.200 --> 12:05.120
he goes on to say.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.960
I spent 15 years working with Linux

12:06.960 --> 12:09.000
and founded a couple of open source companies.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.600
My first commit to GitHub was in 2009

12:11.600 --> 12:13.320
when GitHub was just a year old.

12:13.320 --> 12:15.840
Two years ago, I joined Microsoft

12:15.840 --> 12:18.480
when it acquired Xamarin, a developer-focused company

12:18.480 --> 12:21.120
that I started with Miguel Atacaza.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.800
And he goes on to write about how GitHub will operate

12:23.800 --> 12:26.560
independently as a community platform and a business.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.480
GitHub will retain its developer-first values,

12:28.480 --> 12:32.160
distinctive spirit, and open extensibility.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.360
And he says, we're going to support any language license

12:34.360 --> 12:36.240
tool, platform, or cloud.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.880
And they're going to retain their product philosophy

12:38.880 --> 12:39.480
as well.

12:39.480 --> 12:43.040
Now, he's not going to run the place until the deal is over.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.600
But you've got to give them some credit here.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.240
They've made a lot of inroads with.NET Core,

12:48.240 --> 12:51.480
with Visual Studio Code, with a lot of the other projects

12:51.480 --> 12:54.000
they have up on GitHub that we don't even mention very often.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.200
Plus, the Windows source code is up on GitHub.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.200
And a lot of people have reached out to me

12:58.200 --> 13:01.400
that work at Microsoft and said, we just use Git a lot

13:01.400 --> 13:02.040
internally.

13:02.040 --> 13:06.680
If they screw up Git, we're going to just go ballistic.

13:06.680 --> 13:12.200
So there could be a potential for a new dynamic here,

13:12.200 --> 13:14.720
a new Microsoft that we've witnessed sort of change

13:14.720 --> 13:16.280
and evolve over the years.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.760
And when Satya Nadella took over and the tone changed,

13:18.760 --> 13:20.400
I was the biggest skeptic of all of it.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.840
I thought, this is just marketing.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.200
You know, a company doesn't just change on a dime

13:24.200 --> 13:25.520
when you change out the CEO.

13:25.520 --> 13:29.800
They have deep, deep, deep cultural beliefs.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.640
But then over the years, we've learned

13:31.640 --> 13:34.840
that there was a lot of internal layoffs, and retooling,

13:34.840 --> 13:36.200
and refocusing.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.920
And I ended up talking to individuals

13:37.920 --> 13:40.040
that were fresh out of college that were brought in

13:40.040 --> 13:43.680
that were using Linux at Microsoft.

13:43.680 --> 13:45.840
It's possible they're not going to screw this up.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.800
I think we have to also consider that.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.640
Both things are possible.

13:49.640 --> 13:53.480
Only one way to tell where we will just have to wait and see.

13:53.480 --> 13:54.720
I guess.

13:54.720 --> 13:55.560
I guess so.

13:55.560 --> 13:59.320
My recommendation, still clone all your repositories,

13:59.320 --> 14:01.800
keep a local backup, rely less on GitHub,

14:01.800 --> 14:03.160
and hope for the best.

14:03.160 --> 14:04.040
Yeah.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.480
That's exactly what I did.

14:05.480 --> 14:06.840
Yeah, and I think you're seeing a lot of people

14:06.840 --> 14:07.720
this week say that.

14:07.720 --> 14:08.920
I think a lot of people are saying,

14:08.920 --> 14:09.840
oh, all right, I'm out of here.

14:09.840 --> 14:10.560
I'm on GitLab.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.200
I'm out.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.920
And although PFSense just announced that they're

14:14.920 --> 14:17.680
moving some stuff to GitHub, as a lot of people

14:17.680 --> 14:20.920
are leaving, a few folks, like I know Michael Dominic has

14:20.920 --> 14:24.320
considered this on Coder Radio, and now PFSense,

14:24.320 --> 14:27.040
are moving over to GitHub to essentially,

14:27.040 --> 14:29.520
from what I kind of read from this,

14:29.520 --> 14:32.080
is to outsource GDPR compliance.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.760
To just say, all right, well, they're handling those things,

14:34.760 --> 14:36.760
and so now we're compliant.

14:36.760 --> 14:38.240
In fact, it's the number one reason

14:38.240 --> 14:40.320
PFSense lists on their blog.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.200
They say, we don't have to worry about storing

14:42.200 --> 14:44.520
any personal information about contributors,

14:44.520 --> 14:46.640
and contributors don't have to worry about creating

14:46.640 --> 14:49.280
an account with limited use cases.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.840
That's the number one reason is GDPR compliance.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.000
And then they talk about a bunch of other things

14:54.000 --> 14:55.920
that people always talk about when they go to GitHub.

14:55.920 --> 14:56.400
Yeah.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.480
Well, I think that plays into it, right?

14:58.480 --> 15:00.800
Where I think of GitHub a lot, kind of like YouTube,

15:00.800 --> 15:02.440
where it might not be your favorite place.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.360
It might not be where you wish that you had to find stuff,

15:05.360 --> 15:08.240
but it just has that social component.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.640
So yeah, people, either you're an open source developer

15:10.640 --> 15:12.680
or a personal user, and you should already

15:12.680 --> 15:14.680
take advantage of the decentralized nature of Git

15:14.680 --> 15:16.760
and have your own local clones, or push things up

15:16.760 --> 15:18.280
to multiple, or run your own.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.200
There's so many options.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.640
Or if you're a business, then it just kind of makes sense,

15:21.640 --> 15:23.920
and it doesn't matter because that's a separate world,

15:23.920 --> 15:25.640
and that's a private business agreement.

15:25.640 --> 15:26.400
Yeah.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.480
So are you a user of Atom?

15:28.480 --> 15:31.640
I can't remember your text editor of choice.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.840
Well, I kind of use all the things that rotates.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.160
I have used Atom a little bit.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.280
I don't use it all the time.

15:37.280 --> 15:37.800
Yeah.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.480
So that's been the big speculation is, well,

15:39.480 --> 15:40.440
what happens with Atom?

15:40.440 --> 15:42.640
Because you have, as they say in the corporate world,

15:42.640 --> 15:45.360
redundancies here between Atom and Visual Studio Code.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.080
Well, one of the core developers to Atom

15:47.080 --> 15:49.400
tweeted, I actually don't know where he posted this.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.120
I think it was actually on Discord.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.400
Just to let everyone know, I've been given assurances

15:53.400 --> 15:55.200
that Atom remains key to GitHub.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.000
Our product roadmap is set, and the team

15:57.000 --> 15:59.200
will continue all of their work.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.280
So Atom continues on.

16:00.280 --> 16:03.760
So you're going to have VS Code and Atom sort of duked out,

16:03.760 --> 16:05.760
both based on Electron, both kind

16:05.760 --> 16:07.880
of the same fundamental technologies trying

16:07.880 --> 16:09.280
to accomplish the same thing.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.440
They do feel slightly more redundant now,

16:11.440 --> 16:14.360
but I suppose it's a large enough organization if there

16:14.360 --> 16:16.560
really are this separate that it's sort of, you know?

16:16.560 --> 16:18.560
They don't necessarily care about that too much,

16:18.560 --> 16:21.680
as long as it doesn't suck up a huge amount of GitHub's energy.

16:21.680 --> 16:22.440
Yeah.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.280
I think both you and I follow Ben Thompson on SirTekary.

16:25.280 --> 16:26.520
I think you follow him, too.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.480
I can't remember.

16:27.480 --> 16:28.120
Yeah.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.200
And I've liked his recent takes on the shutdown of some

16:31.200 --> 16:33.280
of the Windows teams at Microsoft and whatnot.

16:33.280 --> 16:38.200
So I'll link in the show notes at linuxunplug.com slash 252.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.120
Is that where we're at?

16:39.120 --> 16:40.120
That's where we're at.

16:40.120 --> 16:43.360
Um, so I'll link the whole thing in there

16:43.360 --> 16:45.040
because it's super long, and I'm just

16:45.040 --> 16:47.000
going to read you one of the last paragraphs.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.320
But he says, what Microsoft wants from their purchase

16:50.320 --> 16:51.520
from GitHub is fuzzy.

16:51.520 --> 16:54.360
They want to be developers' friends in large part

16:54.360 --> 16:56.520
because it has no other option.

16:56.520 --> 17:00.280
In the long run, particularly as Windows continues to fade,

17:00.280 --> 17:02.360
the company will be ever more invested

17:02.360 --> 17:06.120
in a world with no gatekeepers, where developer tools and clouds

17:06.120 --> 17:08.760
win by being better on merits, not

17:08.760 --> 17:11.360
by being able to leverage users.

17:11.360 --> 17:12.240
Do you agree with that?

17:12.240 --> 17:15.840
You know, at least partly, I do think it will be.

17:15.840 --> 17:19.960
It is fuzzy, and Windows has sort of to fade.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.040
So it does kind of feel like a play there, too,

17:22.040 --> 17:23.760
of we want to be relevant.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.200
We want to be in these worlds.

17:25.200 --> 17:28.320
And I think there's probably also a lot of tech startups

17:28.320 --> 17:30.720
or other companies with a lot of MacBooks in there,

17:30.720 --> 17:32.880
or maybe even Linux laptops that just don't have

17:32.880 --> 17:34.640
that much of a relationship with Microsoft

17:34.640 --> 17:36.320
unless they're using some of their tools.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.920
So the further they can spread that,

17:37.920 --> 17:41.400
it's more mind share and maybe a backdoor sales account

17:41.400 --> 17:42.920
for the enterprise section, too.

17:42.920 --> 17:48.160
So remember the prediction of Linux distribution

17:48.160 --> 17:52.040
from Microsoft with the desktop environment, Windows desktop

17:52.040 --> 17:53.640
environment?

17:53.640 --> 17:55.600
Like in the past, they have, look,

17:55.600 --> 17:58.760
the guy that is going to be managing

17:58.760 --> 18:00.360
is a guy that came from Xamarin.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.720
Exactly the point.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.720
Microsoft is not acquiring companies

18:03.720 --> 18:07.600
on the exclusive merits of the products that they have,

18:07.600 --> 18:09.840
but oftentimes because of the human resources

18:09.840 --> 18:12.200
without having to signal the market that they're

18:12.200 --> 18:13.720
hiring for such positions.

18:13.720 --> 18:16.760
Because you can't lie on the job advertisement

18:16.760 --> 18:18.560
what the skills are required, and you

18:18.560 --> 18:21.040
indicate what you're going to be working with.

18:21.040 --> 18:24.440
Now GitHub is a team that deals a lot with Linux,

18:24.440 --> 18:28.840
deals a lot with cloud, deals a lot of making good APIs,

18:28.840 --> 18:33.240
and that just goes straight into the vision of making

18:33.240 --> 18:34.880
that Linux distribution.

18:34.880 --> 18:36.240
I would love to see it, just because it

18:36.240 --> 18:37.960
would be such a massive disruption.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.800
So I kind of hope you're right.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.920
I kind of agree with Ben Thompson here.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.480
I think this is what we are watching

18:43.480 --> 18:45.800
as Microsoft continue to try to carve out

18:45.800 --> 18:50.360
a new area of relevancy before they're really bleeding.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.480
And I think they're being pretty clever about the way

18:52.480 --> 18:52.880
they're doing it.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.520
While they still have a great strong Windows customer base

18:55.520 --> 18:58.240
and they still have plenty of dominance in the market,

18:58.240 --> 19:00.120
they're moving into this new area.

19:00.120 --> 19:02.680
And that's how I see the GitHub purchase playing

19:02.680 --> 19:03.680
into all of that.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.240
As far as the speculation about what's

19:05.240 --> 19:08.840
going to happen to it, as far as deploy on Azure buttons

19:08.840 --> 19:11.720
or integration with Azure, I'm sure some of that

19:11.720 --> 19:14.960
is going to come eventually.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.000
I want to table the Electron discussion,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.800
though, because I think that, almost outside of all of this,

19:19.800 --> 19:21.880
imagine for a moment if Microsoft had just come along

19:21.880 --> 19:23.560
and bought the whole Electron technology stack.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.120
Now, of course, it's MIT licensed and all that.

19:25.120 --> 19:28.160
But we're going to talk about it for a moment,

19:28.160 --> 19:30.520
just zooming out from GitHub and just talking about Electron.

19:30.520 --> 19:31.320
But save that.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.060
We'll talk about that later in the show.

19:33.060 --> 19:36.040
But before we're still talking about GitHub,

19:36.040 --> 19:37.600
let's talk about GitLab.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.760
Now, a lot of the audience members

19:39.760 --> 19:41.220
have either tweeted me, or they've

19:41.220 --> 19:43.880
been talking to the Telegram groups, or on Coda Radio,

19:43.880 --> 19:44.960
they emailed in a bunch.

19:44.960 --> 19:48.400
And people are trying out GitLab like crazy.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.800
And I think that's been the number one response I've seen

19:51.800 --> 19:53.560
is, oh, OK, I'm moving to GitLab.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.120
And GitLab, if you're not familiar with,

19:56.120 --> 20:00.240
it is an open source core style business.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.840
So GitLab itself is open source.

20:01.840 --> 20:04.240
You can go install in the Linux box for free.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.200
It's Git compatible.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.040
It's pretty great.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.320
Wes, you must have played around with it before, I'm sure.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.160
Yeah, absolutely.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.640
I'm a user of their free service as well.

20:11.640 --> 20:14.720
So I have code both on GitHub and GitLab.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.760
They've been doing a ton of stuff with their CI CD tooling.

20:17.760 --> 20:20.600
They have some neat sort of continuous integration

20:20.600 --> 20:23.400
just baked right in, as well as integration with Kubernetes

20:23.400 --> 20:24.520
and other things.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.900
There is still the fear, of course,

20:25.900 --> 20:29.360
that as they've evolved to the open core model,

20:29.360 --> 20:31.500
more and more things are not in that core.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.360
Sometimes things that you get on GitHub

20:33.360 --> 20:35.840
or some of the other platforms where you might want fancy

20:35.840 --> 20:37.680
or merge support, that sort of thing.

20:37.680 --> 20:39.040
So how much does it get you?

20:39.040 --> 20:39.960
Yes, it's open source.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.520
Yes, that's important.

20:41.520 --> 20:44.000
It's also just nice, maybe if you care less about that

20:44.000 --> 20:45.920
or if you feel that it's not as genuine,

20:45.920 --> 20:48.040
it's also just nice to have another player that is

20:48.040 --> 20:49.800
plausibly competing against GitHub.

20:49.800 --> 20:51.720
And it's easy to move between them, yes?

20:51.720 --> 20:52.400
Fairly so.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.760
There's definitely differences.

20:53.760 --> 20:57.440
But if you're not super tied into all the feature

20:57.440 --> 21:00.320
sets of one side or the other, if you're just

21:00.320 --> 21:03.120
using it for storing a repository and cloning it

21:03.120 --> 21:05.160
and sharing it, then yeah, it's pretty easy.

21:05.160 --> 21:06.800
Yeah, I think probably the biggest advantage,

21:06.800 --> 21:09.240
it sounds like, to GitLab is that you can self-host it.

21:09.240 --> 21:12.080
And this whole event is a reminder

21:12.080 --> 21:14.680
of the massive centralization we're

21:14.680 --> 21:15.800
seeing in the tech industry.

21:15.800 --> 21:19.400
Now one of the top five tech companies now owns GitHub.

21:19.400 --> 21:22.400
And I'm a believer of the narrative

21:22.400 --> 21:24.000
that this was going to happen eventually.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.280
If Google was going after them, too,

21:26.280 --> 21:28.760
that just sort of doubles down on that narrative.

21:28.760 --> 21:31.480
A lot of people online have been saying that GitHub should

21:31.480 --> 21:32.600
have remained independent.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.080
That's what made them great.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.480
And I've been arguing this was always going to happen.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.960
GitHub has had leadership issues for a while.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.160
They've had money issues.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.760
They've just sort of been primed for purchase

21:43.760 --> 21:44.920
for a little bit now.

21:44.920 --> 21:45.280
Yeah, right.

21:45.280 --> 21:45.960
I mean, it ties back in.

21:45.960 --> 21:46.640
They're a business.

21:46.640 --> 21:49.400
They're just going to have to operate that way, whatever

21:49.400 --> 21:51.720
the community wants, regardless.

21:51.720 --> 21:54.760
And since self-hosting is such a big component of why people

21:54.760 --> 21:57.080
are moving to GitLab, let's talk about Digital Ocean

21:57.080 --> 22:01.480
for a moment, our sponsor, do.co slash unplugged.

22:01.480 --> 22:04.280
You can get a $100 credit when you go there for 60 days

22:04.280 --> 22:06.040
when you sign up with a new account.

22:06.040 --> 22:08.680
This is a way for you to deploy GitLab in seconds.

22:08.680 --> 22:11.440
I'll link you in the show notes to a one-click deployment

22:11.440 --> 22:14.040
of GitLab and to a guide where you can build it yourself

22:14.040 --> 22:14.880
from the ground up.

22:14.880 --> 22:17.360
So whichever approach you like, you

22:17.360 --> 22:19.280
can get started with this $100 credit.

22:19.280 --> 22:20.960
And you can experiment with moving over.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.120
And if it works for you, just keep it in production.

22:23.120 --> 22:25.400
My favorite system that would be way more than you'd

22:25.400 --> 22:28.160
need for something like this is $0.03 an hour.

22:28.160 --> 22:31.160
You could probably get by with the $5 a month rig.

22:31.160 --> 22:34.080
And with a $100 credit, that's going to go with a nicer rig.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.400
Because you can just really play around with Digital Ocean.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.200
They have all SSD systems.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.640
They have data centers all over the world.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.920
They have a great interface to manage all of this

22:42.920 --> 22:46.320
and a really clear, easy, well-documented API

22:46.320 --> 22:49.000
that there's tons of good open source applications already

22:49.000 --> 22:49.720
built for.

22:49.720 --> 22:52.120
So they bring all of that together with that dashboard,

22:52.120 --> 22:53.640
with these one-click deployments,

22:53.640 --> 22:55.320
and that documentation.

22:55.320 --> 22:59.640
And you get the $100 credit when you go to do.co slash unplugged.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.560
You can deploy lots of different distributions

23:01.560 --> 23:03.080
if you want to build the system yourself.

23:03.080 --> 23:04.480
You can attach block storage when

23:04.480 --> 23:05.720
you need to add more storage.

23:05.720 --> 23:08.720
They have a 99.99% uptime SLA.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.920
They have Cloud Firewall so you can block traffic

23:10.920 --> 23:13.400
at the network level before they even touch your rig,

23:13.400 --> 23:14.280
which is brilliant.

23:14.280 --> 23:15.600
That's how it should all work.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.680
And they have monitoring and alerting built into.

23:17.680 --> 23:20.240
So you can check on the metrics, get

23:20.240 --> 23:21.840
alerted if something goes down.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.800
And with global data centers, if you have people

23:23.800 --> 23:25.960
that you're working with in a team around the world,

23:25.960 --> 23:28.600
you can put something in their area that's super fast.

23:28.600 --> 23:31.280
And with those enterprise SSDs, you know it will be.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.900
So if you're ready to get started, go to do.co slash

23:33.900 --> 23:34.400
unplugged.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.320
Take advantage of our $100 credit.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.560
Why not try out GitLab for a bit?

23:38.560 --> 23:40.400
So I'll have in the show notes the how

23:40.400 --> 23:42.920
to use GitLab one-click install image to manage your Git

23:42.920 --> 23:45.720
repositories, or also the step-by-step,

23:45.720 --> 23:47.480
build it all the way up from the system up.

23:47.480 --> 23:49.680
Because they just have fantastic documentation.

23:49.680 --> 23:52.600
do.co slash unplugged.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.600
Big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged

23:54.600 --> 23:55.360
program.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.920
So let's talk about the K-Win maintainer

23:57.920 --> 24:00.400
that we often mention on this show stepping down,

24:00.400 --> 24:04.200
Martin, who I think is a brilliant individual.

24:04.200 --> 24:07.500
And he announced on the K-Win development,

24:07.500 --> 24:09.840
or I'm sorry, the plasma development mailing list,

24:09.840 --> 24:13.640
that he is stepping away from the maintainer position.

24:13.640 --> 24:17.960
And he has several reasons in here that some of it

24:17.960 --> 24:19.800
seem to be personal opinions, and some of it

24:19.800 --> 24:22.640
seem to be experiences that he's had.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.080
And they kind of come down to maybe the design group

24:25.080 --> 24:28.840
sort of running away with the decision process.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.560
He says, I really dislike the development Katie is taking,

24:31.560 --> 24:33.480
where usability is the goal.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.120
But we don't stop to see if something

24:35.120 --> 24:37.920
is long-term maintainable.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.760
After we develop it, can we actually support it

24:39.760 --> 24:40.600
for a while?

24:40.600 --> 24:43.200
When we started Plasma 5, the fundamentals of the project

24:43.200 --> 24:46.040
were focus on the basics and only what we can maintain.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.800
And we've moved away from that, he says.

24:48.800 --> 24:51.540
And I don't know if that's true or not.

24:51.540 --> 24:53.320
That's his opinion.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.240
But he would seem to be in a position

24:55.240 --> 24:56.760
to make that determination.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.260
He says, for the usability project,

24:58.260 --> 25:01.200
my wish is not to take every user request as a mission.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.160
Instead, evaluate whether it makes sense for the project.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.160
Perhaps also consult the domain experts

25:06.160 --> 25:07.840
prior to writing patches.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.240
It's way more difficult to say no to a change

25:10.240 --> 25:12.040
if the patch is already there.

25:12.040 --> 25:14.760
And when I read through his entire post here,

25:14.760 --> 25:16.600
what I kind of took away from this

25:16.600 --> 25:19.960
is there was some decisions around the log-in manager

25:19.960 --> 25:22.360
and some borders and a no-border discussion

25:22.360 --> 25:25.000
that he was left out of, for whatever reason.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.520
Maybe it was a place he doesn't lurk or whatever.

25:28.520 --> 25:31.600
And the design group created patches.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.560
And it created a bunch of momentum.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.520
And it was essentially the decision was made.

25:36.520 --> 25:38.720
And then when it got in front of him and he realized,

25:38.720 --> 25:41.400
well, wait a minute, we have serious technical implementation

25:41.400 --> 25:42.360
issues with this.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.960
Why wasn't anybody consulted about this?

25:44.960 --> 25:45.760
It was too late.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.400
And then it becomes sort of a political fight

25:48.400 --> 25:51.160
because you have somebody who's got a precious baby that now

25:51.160 --> 25:52.200
they're trying to get born.

25:52.200 --> 25:53.320
And then you have somebody coming along

25:53.320 --> 25:54.560
and popping their bubble.

25:54.560 --> 25:58.600
So it creates a lot of feelings, I guess you could say.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.040
I think so, yeah, right?

26:00.040 --> 26:01.200
I mean, on both sides, right?

26:01.200 --> 26:03.500
When you work really hard on things, you care about it.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.800
And there's not always a right answer.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.000
Yeah, exactly.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.720
Because as a recent Plasma user, I've

26:09.720 --> 26:12.880
been so happy with it that I hate to see anything like this.

26:12.880 --> 26:16.880
But some of this does kind of strike me as true.

26:19.560 --> 26:22.720
He says, we should strive for satisfying 90% of the user

26:22.720 --> 26:24.240
base and not everyone.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.400
Currently, we try to satisfy everyone.

26:26.400 --> 26:29.320
This is a road to failure, in my opinion.

26:29.320 --> 26:32.920
We're on the road to KDE 3's configuration nightmare

26:32.920 --> 26:35.600
and creating an unmaintainable monster.

26:35.600 --> 26:38.440
And I could kind of see that perspective

26:38.440 --> 26:41.520
because I've been advocating now for about a year and a half

26:41.520 --> 26:43.600
that we need to just forget the idea

26:43.600 --> 26:45.720
that we're trying to find the new Linux user.

26:45.720 --> 26:48.440
There is no such thing as the person who

26:48.440 --> 26:50.160
is unfamiliar with how computers work

26:50.160 --> 26:52.280
and is also buying a Linux computer

26:52.280 --> 26:54.000
or building a Linux PC.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.240
These two things do not exist.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.720
They may get a Chromebook and may eventually one day

26:58.720 --> 26:59.960
run Linux apps.

26:59.960 --> 27:04.080
But we've always tried to design our desktop environments

27:04.080 --> 27:07.160
and our applications for new users, for new users.

27:07.160 --> 27:09.880
Well, the new users that are coming to Linux

27:09.880 --> 27:11.400
are technical experts.

27:11.400 --> 27:12.720
They're system engineers.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.440
They're software developers.

27:14.440 --> 27:16.760
They're enthusiasts who love hardware.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.920
They're people who love to mess around with source code

27:19.920 --> 27:21.400
and write free software.

27:21.400 --> 27:25.520
It's people who know how to mess with computers.

27:25.520 --> 27:29.480
And what his point is, and I kind of click with it,

27:29.480 --> 27:33.320
is that perhaps Plasma has gotten on this usability kick

27:33.320 --> 27:35.760
because of the years and years of Plasma's too hard to use,

27:35.760 --> 27:40.120
too much configuration, and now they've run away with it.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.120
Do you think there's something to this, Wes?

27:42.120 --> 27:43.520
I know you don't use Plasma a ton,

27:43.520 --> 27:44.520
but you've been using it more and more.

27:44.520 --> 27:47.200
Yeah, I have been using it more and more.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.320
I can see maybe a soft trend.

27:49.320 --> 27:51.080
I don't know if it's as bad as this.

27:51.080 --> 27:52.480
I just don't follow it that closely.

27:52.480 --> 27:55.080
But I do think it's a legitimate concern, especially

27:55.080 --> 27:58.440
for a large, long-lived open source project

27:58.440 --> 28:02.080
where there's not necessarily one very careful,

28:02.080 --> 28:05.400
curating, benevolent dictator sort of situation.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.440
You really do need to only add things that you can maintain.

28:08.440 --> 28:11.080
And as we've seen, as we're talking about with Gnome,

28:11.080 --> 28:14.960
if you're not careful, if you do build on unsolid foundations

28:14.960 --> 28:17.440
or add things that are going to increase your debt

28:17.440 --> 28:20.040
and make things harder and less agile down the road,

28:20.040 --> 28:22.640
it takes a long time to undo that.

28:22.640 --> 28:24.320
Yeah, and hopefully Martin sticks around

28:24.320 --> 28:27.400
because I've always really respected his technical opinion.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.880
And he's always been willing to go to the mat

28:28.880 --> 28:31.600
to defend what he thinks is the right decision technically.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.560
He's also a really, he's just a good communicator.

28:33.560 --> 28:35.640
And I think he's given us a lot of really interesting views

28:35.640 --> 28:38.480
into what's going on behind the scenes of plasma development.

28:38.480 --> 28:39.960
Yeah, and I'll link to his full post

28:39.960 --> 28:41.880
because when you read it, you really

28:41.880 --> 28:43.960
take away somebody who cares about the project.

28:43.960 --> 28:47.640
And he's not like rage quitting and going away.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.320
He's like, I'm still going to stick around

28:49.320 --> 28:51.600
and maybe write a few patches and help out here and there

28:51.600 --> 28:52.600
and answer some questions.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.400
But I'm just not really enjoying the maintainer aspect anymore.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.440
And you've got to respect that, too,

28:56.440 --> 28:58.360
because you could just see someone after all these years

28:58.360 --> 28:59.200
just saying, that's it, I'm out.

28:59.200 --> 28:59.960
I rage quit.

28:59.960 --> 29:01.360
And he's like, no, I'm going to stick around.

29:01.360 --> 29:03.040
I'll still be part of the community.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.680
So I respect that, too.

29:04.680 --> 29:07.160
Now, I did just mention that Linux on Chromebooks thing

29:07.160 --> 29:07.880
there.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.680
Well, you know already, everybody's

29:09.680 --> 29:13.160
been talking about how the fancy Pixelbook,

29:13.160 --> 29:14.800
if you get in the dev channel, is

29:14.800 --> 29:16.800
going to be running Linux apps like either now

29:16.800 --> 29:18.200
or very, very soon.

29:18.200 --> 29:21.640
But we weren't really clear on some of the lower end,

29:21.640 --> 29:25.760
quote unquote, lower end, even ARM-based Chromebooks

29:25.760 --> 29:27.520
until today.

29:27.520 --> 29:32.760
The Samsung Chromebook Plus is getting Linux support

29:32.760 --> 29:35.680
as spotted by users once again on Reddit.

29:35.680 --> 29:38.640
If you have the Samsung Chromebook Plus

29:38.640 --> 29:41.240
and you opt into the developer-only build of Chrome

29:41.240 --> 29:44.360
OS and enable things that are labeled as beta

29:44.360 --> 29:47.560
and then use the terminal, you can apt-get software.

29:47.560 --> 29:51.600
And you can run Linux apps on this ARM-based Samsung

29:51.600 --> 29:54.800
Chromebook Plus, which you can pick up used for like $300,

29:54.800 --> 29:55.280
I think.

29:55.280 --> 29:55.960
Wow, really?

29:55.960 --> 29:57.040
Somewhere around there.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.360
Yeah, so it's not the cheapest.

29:58.360 --> 30:01.320
But it is an ARM Chromebook, which so far, this

30:01.320 --> 30:04.160
has been limited to the x86 line,

30:04.160 --> 30:07.800
or I guess you should say x64 line of Pixelbooks.

30:07.800 --> 30:08.840
It's 2018, Chris.

30:08.840 --> 30:09.560
It's 2018.

30:09.560 --> 30:10.880
I know.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.560
I got tweeted about that.

30:12.560 --> 30:15.280
Stop saying x86, Chris.

30:15.280 --> 30:16.280
I'm like, you know what?

30:16.280 --> 30:17.040
He's probably right.

30:17.040 --> 30:21.040
I could say i686, but I think I'll try to say x64.

30:21.040 --> 30:23.640
So it was limited to the Chromebook Pixelbook before.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.280
But now we have an ARM version of a Chromebook

30:26.280 --> 30:30.560
that more average mortals can buy and afford.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.640
You can get it off Amazon right now.

30:32.640 --> 30:37.320
And it's probably not going to be the same range as an x64

30:37.320 --> 30:40.320
Pixelbook, but it's still going to be a bunch of apps.

30:40.320 --> 30:42.760
And it immediately is turning that thing

30:42.760 --> 30:44.480
into a much more useful tool.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.240
Yeah, that was what I thought, too, right?

30:46.240 --> 30:48.320
Suddenly, I wasn't really interested in Chromebooks

30:48.320 --> 30:50.840
before, maybe for other people in my life, but not for me.

30:50.840 --> 30:53.400
But now, maybe like as a travel laptop,

30:53.400 --> 30:55.780
or you just need something spare while your main machine,

30:55.780 --> 30:57.400
you're switching machines, or getting something repaired,

30:57.400 --> 30:58.560
or just something to throw in your bag

30:58.560 --> 31:00.480
and not have to worry about, not have to futz with.

31:00.480 --> 31:02.280
Once you've got it, if you have a terminal,

31:02.280 --> 31:05.520
and you have Chrome, and then whatever other Linux apps

31:05.520 --> 31:07.960
you need to get your job done, perfect.

31:07.960 --> 31:11.640
Yeah, you and I have talked about this arrangement

31:11.640 --> 31:15.880
in the past, where you've got a lower end, front end laptop,

31:15.880 --> 31:18.440
and then back at home, or in the office, or in my case,

31:18.440 --> 31:21.440
the studio, you've got a much more powerful machine

31:21.440 --> 31:24.680
that you remote into and do the actual work on.

31:24.680 --> 31:28.520
And that's what I've been doing for this whole road trip.

31:28.520 --> 31:32.680
I'm on an XPS 13, which is like three revisions old now,

31:32.680 --> 31:34.880
or four revisions old now, I don't even know anymore.

31:34.880 --> 31:38.480
And the real work is all being done back in the studio.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.920
Like when we render video, or encode audio,

31:40.920 --> 31:44.520
I'm executing those jobs on six core machines in the studio,

31:44.520 --> 31:47.600
and not on my little two core XPS 13 here.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.840
And it is time for me to replace this thing,

31:49.840 --> 31:51.340
because I busted the side and stuff,

31:51.340 --> 31:53.920
so it's kind of falling apart, and God,

31:53.920 --> 31:56.400
is it super hot right now too, it's really warm.

31:56.400 --> 31:59.400
It's funny, like everything's hot around me.

31:59.400 --> 32:02.680
The microphone is hot to touch, like mics don't heat up,

32:02.680 --> 32:05.120
but this one is hot to touch, everything's super hot.

32:05.120 --> 32:09.640
So if I were like burn through my XPS 13 on this road trip,

32:09.640 --> 32:11.400
which is kind of falling apart on me at this point,

32:11.400 --> 32:16.000
because I dropped it, I almost could make it work

32:16.000 --> 32:17.760
on a Chromebook, I could almost do it.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.480
I could almost do this whole road trip.

32:19.480 --> 32:22.760
I couldn't do unfilter, or this show,

32:22.760 --> 32:24.400
but I could do almost all of,

32:24.400 --> 32:26.320
I don't know, maybe I'll do unfilter on a Chromebook

32:26.320 --> 32:27.780
if I had just a couple of Linux apps.

32:27.780 --> 32:31.560
I mean, it's getting really serious if you do big tasks

32:31.560 --> 32:34.340
on more remote high-end systems, or on a server.

32:34.340 --> 32:35.360
There's also maybe like a weird,

32:35.360 --> 32:36.240
I wouldn't have thought this,

32:36.240 --> 32:38.600
but maybe there's a nice aspect too about like,

32:38.600 --> 32:41.360
if you spend all the time configuring the studio machine,

32:41.360 --> 32:42.720
you get that just how you need it,

32:42.720 --> 32:43.920
and then if you can just pick this up

32:43.920 --> 32:45.960
and not have to do much, not install an OS,

32:45.960 --> 32:48.960
not customize Plasma, which sometimes is nice,

32:48.960 --> 32:50.880
but if you just use the machine while you're traveling,

32:50.880 --> 32:53.720
or not every day, it's kind of just like you can buy it

32:53.720 --> 32:55.960
from a store, you get maybe the security

32:55.960 --> 32:57.880
where some of the other things are easier, or simpler,

32:57.880 --> 33:00.640
or just managed for you, and that's kind of convenient.

33:00.640 --> 33:04.680
If you travel a lot, that kind of flexibility is,

33:04.680 --> 33:05.680
I'll talk about it more in a second,

33:05.680 --> 33:07.000
but you know, I'm going to Linux Academy

33:07.000 --> 33:08.840
to help them move their broadcast system

33:08.840 --> 33:11.740
from a Mac to Linux, and one of the things

33:11.740 --> 33:14.640
that I talked about is, I said, when we get a PC,

33:14.640 --> 33:16.160
let's get something that's Linux compatible,

33:16.160 --> 33:18.200
but keep in mind, one of the advantages now

33:18.200 --> 33:22.940
that we are gaining by moving from a Mac to Linux

33:22.940 --> 33:26.680
is we now have general availability of PC hardware,

33:26.680 --> 33:29.440
so when you go somewhere for a live Linux Academy event,

33:29.440 --> 33:31.700
like when you fly to Denver for an event,

33:31.700 --> 33:33.320
or you fly to California for an event,

33:33.320 --> 33:35.440
and you get there and your PCs died

33:35.440 --> 33:37.580
because something got rattled on the flight,

33:37.580 --> 33:38.760
or you ship it and they screw it up,

33:38.760 --> 33:41.440
because that happens every other event to us,

33:41.440 --> 33:46.040
literally, it's so bad that we try to carry

33:46.040 --> 33:48.120
all of the equipment in the RV whenever possible,

33:48.120 --> 33:52.200
because when we ship it, it just constantly gets damaged,

33:52.200 --> 33:55.120
even with serious Pelican cases, real packing,

33:55.120 --> 33:57.040
I mean, Noah really knows what he's doing with this stuff,

33:57.040 --> 33:59.840
and it still gets damaged, and so I said to him,

33:59.840 --> 34:02.680
I said, the biggest advantage you have now

34:02.680 --> 34:04.660
is you can go into a store, and if it's got

34:04.660 --> 34:07.200
the right components, you can buy it right there,

34:07.200 --> 34:08.720
take it back to your hotel room,

34:08.720 --> 34:11.980
load Kubuntu on this thing, and within two hours,

34:11.980 --> 34:13.900
it's broadcast ready, because it's this

34:13.900 --> 34:16.320
general availability of hardware,

34:16.320 --> 34:18.520
and that's what I also dig about the Chromebooks.

34:18.520 --> 34:20.480
If you could make that workflow work,

34:20.480 --> 34:21.860
you know, if I burned out a Chromebook

34:21.860 --> 34:23.560
sitting here right now, or I dropped it

34:23.560 --> 34:25.760
and it really got damaged, or if I was on a flight

34:25.760 --> 34:29.280
and it got damaged or lost, I could just replace

34:29.280 --> 34:31.120
that machine, it would be an expense,

34:31.120 --> 34:32.760
but it would be a manageable expense,

34:32.760 --> 34:34.880
and I would be right back up and working.

34:34.880 --> 34:38.040
So I really, I think this is one of those events

34:38.040 --> 34:41.060
that it's like the big bang, like it starts somewhere,

34:41.060 --> 34:42.960
and you're like, oh, that looked like a little explosion

34:42.960 --> 34:45.080
over there, and over time, it expands

34:45.080 --> 34:47.200
into this massive sea change.

34:47.200 --> 34:49.040
I think it could go that direction.

34:49.040 --> 34:53.060
I don't think it's gonna be like a smartphone revolutionary,

34:53.060 --> 34:55.160
but I think it's gonna change the way

34:55.160 --> 34:56.640
a lot of people work on computers.

34:56.640 --> 34:58.920
In two years, we'll just be quietly talking away

34:58.920 --> 35:02.160
on Chromebooks and not have a second thought about it.

35:02.160 --> 35:05.560
Speaking of two years, today, Nextcloud

35:05.560 --> 35:08.440
is celebrating its second birthday.

35:08.440 --> 35:12.200
732 days later, they say they've shown

35:12.200 --> 35:14.560
their ability to execute on their vision.

35:14.560 --> 35:17.400
Nextcloud is widely recognized as the most innovative,

35:17.400 --> 35:19.760
forward-looking projects in the open source world,

35:19.760 --> 35:22.240
pushing boundaries in the areas of security, collaboration,

35:22.240 --> 35:23.440
and communication.

35:23.440 --> 35:26.080
Their company's grown to more than 40 people,

35:26.080 --> 35:28.120
and one of the things they're most proud of

35:28.120 --> 35:29.800
is when they started out with Nextcloud,

35:29.800 --> 35:32.040
they promised to make upgrades work,

35:32.040 --> 35:34.480
and they think this area's really stood out,

35:34.480 --> 35:37.240
and they've kept that promise, and within a week

35:37.240 --> 35:40.000
of Nextcloud 13, over 10,000 servers

35:40.000 --> 35:41.400
had already successfully upgraded

35:41.400 --> 35:43.920
to the current version, and they also

35:43.920 --> 35:46.080
say they're proud of their security insights.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.440
They've started a bug bounty program,

35:48.440 --> 35:51.600
and in the two years, they've paid out $8,000

35:51.600 --> 35:56.080
to security researchers with over 100 reports

35:56.080 --> 35:58.320
that they've closed as a result.

35:58.320 --> 35:59.840
It's a pretty cool milestone, and I've

35:59.840 --> 36:01.560
been using it more and more.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.200
Since Fedora 28 came out, actually,

36:03.200 --> 36:05.520
I sort of doubled down on my Nextcloud usage

36:05.520 --> 36:08.520
and had it going in the background as a test.

36:08.520 --> 36:11.320
So it's a really neat project, and when

36:11.320 --> 36:15.400
you have a need for it, it can fit that niche really well.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.240
You're making me think, though, maybe I should give Nextcloud.

36:18.240 --> 36:21.000
I tried it back, I guess, about two years ago

36:21.000 --> 36:23.800
when they were first Nextcloud.

36:23.800 --> 36:26.760
I haven't run it for a while, though, so these features

36:26.760 --> 36:27.840
are looking pretty nice.

36:27.840 --> 36:30.400
I say it is worth a go, and now that you

36:30.400 --> 36:32.720
can throw it up in a container in just a few minutes,

36:32.720 --> 36:35.480
an official container from them, I think it's kind of worth it.

36:35.480 --> 36:38.840
Yeah, that lowers the barrier to entry considerably.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.840
So I am here in Texas, sweating in a way

36:41.840 --> 36:44.520
that I have not sweated very many times in my entire life.

36:44.520 --> 36:45.640
It is unbelievably hot.

36:45.640 --> 36:48.400
It's about 101 degrees where I'm sitting.

36:48.400 --> 36:51.960
And because it's Texas, it's Plainsview, Texas,

36:51.960 --> 36:54.360
there's really no trees to be had.

36:54.360 --> 36:57.320
We just made it into Texas this morning, actually.

36:57.320 --> 37:01.200
And we decided on the way down to our current spot

37:01.200 --> 37:02.880
to maybe go get some dog food for Levi

37:02.880 --> 37:04.320
because we were running low.

37:04.320 --> 37:08.880
And that was a bad decision, Wes.

37:08.880 --> 37:09.920
Oh, no, why?

37:09.920 --> 37:11.720
Well, I'm trying to get here to do the show,

37:11.720 --> 37:13.600
and I've got to get connectivity tested,

37:13.600 --> 37:15.040
so we've got to feed Levi, though.

37:15.040 --> 37:16.520
Got to get food for Levi.

37:16.520 --> 37:18.160
We don't want him hungry.

37:18.160 --> 37:18.760
No.

37:18.760 --> 37:22.040
So as I'm pulling off the ramp, it's too small.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.160
The lanes are too narrow.

37:23.160 --> 37:27.120
My rig doesn't fit in them, so I'm kind of in a lane and a half.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.920
And I'm pulling off the off ramp,

37:28.920 --> 37:32.200
and my back two doolies on the passenger side

37:32.200 --> 37:34.760
go over a little curb, just a little curb.

37:34.760 --> 37:35.920
Just a little one, sure.

37:35.920 --> 37:40.280
And it tosses jupes really bad.

37:40.280 --> 37:42.560
It's like if a massive wave were to just crash up

37:42.560 --> 37:45.920
along the side of a boat because it's just this huge shift.

37:45.920 --> 37:51.880
Like, whoa, the whole rig leans all the way to the driver's side.

37:51.880 --> 37:55.320
And that's when the new upgraded suspension kicked in,

37:55.320 --> 37:58.320
as if we were intentionally testing it.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.160
See, we have these new sway bars.

38:00.160 --> 38:03.080
And the way sway bars kind of work

38:03.080 --> 38:05.480
is the amount of force that's applied into them

38:05.480 --> 38:09.960
is then applied backwards to sort of correct the sway,

38:09.960 --> 38:11.360
if that makes any sense.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.440
And they really did their job.

38:13.440 --> 38:16.840
I mean, we swung back up real quick, right back into place.

38:16.840 --> 38:18.480
And much better than before the upgrades,

38:18.480 --> 38:20.840
we would have swayed back and forth like a boat,

38:20.840 --> 38:24.200
like swash, swashed right to left, boom,

38:24.200 --> 38:25.400
which is really hard to drive.

38:25.400 --> 38:29.280
It was really bad because it's a 25,000 pound RV

38:29.280 --> 38:31.960
on top of a suspension system.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.200
But the upgrades really helped that.

38:34.200 --> 38:34.840
They resolved this.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.360
There was no swaying back and forth.

38:36.360 --> 38:38.240
It was right back up to the top.

38:38.240 --> 38:43.120
But in that swing back to the right position,

38:43.120 --> 38:46.080
because the amount of force that gets applied to the sway bars

38:46.080 --> 38:50.240
is also then used to sway back, it sprung us back

38:50.240 --> 38:53.360
like we came out of a pinball spring.

38:53.360 --> 38:57.520
And everything dumped on the passenger side of the RV,

38:57.520 --> 38:59.880
which is where our kitchen and our bathroom is.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.480
Everything came out of the fridge.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.360
It came out of all of the cupboards.

39:03.360 --> 39:06.680
All of our food came out, all of our bathroom stuff

39:06.680 --> 39:10.640
like vitamins that were in little pill jars,

39:10.640 --> 39:13.960
Q-tips everywhere, the Tums bottle exploded.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.040
It was just everywhere.

39:16.040 --> 39:18.080
Beard oil went spilling.

39:18.080 --> 39:21.440
It was the worst incident we've ever had on the road.

39:21.440 --> 39:25.720
And it was thankfully recoverable

39:25.720 --> 39:28.400
because it's all in a contained space.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.560
All the slides are in, and it's not a very big rig.

39:30.560 --> 39:32.440
So all I had to do was get us into some shade

39:32.440 --> 39:34.040
because it's 101 degrees outside,

39:34.040 --> 39:36.240
and it's just bacon when you stop moving.

39:36.240 --> 39:39.520
And so I found some shade alongside the pet store building.

39:39.520 --> 39:41.080
And for about 20 minutes, we just sat there

39:41.080 --> 39:42.360
and had to clean up all the stuff,

39:42.360 --> 39:46.040
but it all back away, throw a bunch of stuff,

39:46.040 --> 39:47.520
stuff that got broke.

39:48.480 --> 39:49.320
So that was a bit of a bummer.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.200
Was there any like liquids that spilled all over

39:51.200 --> 39:52.040
or anything like that?

39:52.040 --> 39:52.880
Oh yeah.

39:52.880 --> 39:55.560
The beard oil spilled, some water spilled.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.440
Yeah, it's okay.

39:56.440 --> 39:58.080
It happens, you know, sometimes.

39:58.080 --> 40:00.080
The important part, did Levi get his food?

40:00.080 --> 40:00.920
And did he like it?

40:00.920 --> 40:01.760
Did he like it?

40:01.760 --> 40:02.600
Yes, yes, all those things.

40:02.600 --> 40:03.920
And he got to walk around the pet store too,

40:03.920 --> 40:04.760
which he liked quite a bit.

40:04.760 --> 40:05.600
Oh, perfect.

40:05.600 --> 40:06.760
Yeah, yeah.

40:06.760 --> 40:08.480
But now back, we were back on the road,

40:08.480 --> 40:10.320
heading down towards Texas Linux Fest,

40:10.320 --> 40:11.960
and we've reached Plainview,

40:11.960 --> 40:15.600
which might be the actual hometown of Levi.

40:15.600 --> 40:16.680
Plainview is on his paperwork.

40:16.680 --> 40:19.160
So we may be in Levi's hometown right now.

40:19.160 --> 40:20.920
And then he made his way up to Washington

40:20.920 --> 40:23.280
where we got him from a rescue.

40:23.280 --> 40:26.560
And we're in this little RV park called the hitching post.

40:26.560 --> 40:28.560
I'm going somewhere with this story.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.560
And when we got here,

40:29.560 --> 40:31.160
we were a little rattled from that whole shakeup.

40:31.160 --> 40:32.880
We'd already cleaned up, we were rattled.

40:32.880 --> 40:34.680
When we got here, we talked to the manager, Karen,

40:34.680 --> 40:35.920
and we said, we'd like to buy a night

40:35.920 --> 40:37.040
so we can just park and hook up

40:37.040 --> 40:39.160
and get some air conditioning because we're dying.

40:39.160 --> 40:42.040
And I'd like to have power to do the show and whatnot.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.120
And Karen said, well, you're just working?

40:44.120 --> 40:46.040
Yeah, yeah, we'll just be here for about five hours or so.

40:46.040 --> 40:47.760
She says, you know, just go find a spot and park.

40:47.760 --> 40:49.600
You can just, don't worry about paying.

40:49.600 --> 40:50.440
You can just stay there for free.

40:50.440 --> 40:51.280
Wow.

40:51.280 --> 40:54.040
Yeah, so we have 50 amps of power, great cell reception.

40:54.040 --> 40:56.160
I can see the cell towers from here.

40:56.160 --> 40:58.960
And 50 amps so we can run both air conditioners

40:58.960 --> 41:00.400
when I'm not recording.

41:00.400 --> 41:02.000
And we got running water for a little bit.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.040
Well, we just sit here and kind of recharge.

41:04.040 --> 41:08.200
And then we have about nine and a half more hours of driving.

41:08.200 --> 41:10.680
And then I'll be in Austin for Texas Linux Fest.

41:10.680 --> 41:12.760
That is so exciting, wow.

41:12.760 --> 41:15.080
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna try to drive more at night

41:15.080 --> 41:18.480
for these last couple of days because it's so hot out

41:18.480 --> 41:20.600
that it drops to about 80 degrees at night

41:20.600 --> 41:23.080
and the roads cool down, so your tires cool down

41:23.080 --> 41:23.920
and all that kind of stuff.

41:23.920 --> 41:25.920
So gonna be doing some nighttime driving

41:25.920 --> 41:27.560
for the next couple of days.

41:27.560 --> 41:28.840
After the show, we're gonna hit the road

41:28.840 --> 41:31.960
and try to put in about five hours tonight if we can.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.760
It's the last grind, Wes.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.720
It's just a grind at this point.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.160
Nothing can stop you now.

41:37.160 --> 41:39.720
And hopefully you'll meet additional really nice Texans

41:39.720 --> 41:41.640
who are just doing you all kinds of favors.

41:41.640 --> 41:43.440
You know, we've already got a good group going.

41:43.440 --> 41:44.360
If you're gonna be in the area,

41:44.360 --> 41:47.040
jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Texas for our Telegram group,

41:47.040 --> 41:48.560
we've got a really good group going.

41:48.560 --> 41:51.840
And then also, the other reason I'm going down to Texas

41:51.840 --> 41:53.720
is for Linux Academy.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.520
Linux Academy has just been growing like crazy.

41:56.520 --> 41:57.960
And as they've brought in more people

41:57.960 --> 41:59.040
and they've done live productions,

41:59.040 --> 42:02.120
they have some productions where they have eight remote hosts,

42:02.120 --> 42:05.720
which is just mind-blowing, complicated kind of stuff.

42:05.720 --> 42:07.440
And as they've brought production people on,

42:07.440 --> 42:08.880
of course, they're trained on how to do all the stuff

42:08.880 --> 42:09.720
on the Mac.

42:09.720 --> 42:12.840
And they're trying to go back and write these ships

42:12.840 --> 42:14.680
as they've expanded and try to get everybody back

42:14.680 --> 42:16.400
on the Linux bandwagon.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.560
What's really, really awesome is I've been chatting

42:18.560 --> 42:19.800
with a couple of individuals down there

42:19.800 --> 42:20.720
and they're totally on board.

42:20.720 --> 42:21.960
Like, there's no resistance.

42:21.960 --> 42:22.800
They're all about it.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.480
They think this is gonna be great and they wanna do it.

42:24.480 --> 42:26.200
And so we started chatting and they said,

42:26.200 --> 42:28.160
yeah, could you come down here and help us move

42:28.160 --> 42:32.680
from macOS Wirecast to Kubuntu OBS, exactly what we've done

42:32.680 --> 42:33.640
for Jupiter Broadcasting.

42:33.640 --> 42:34.920
So I would love to.

42:34.920 --> 42:37.880
So after Texas Linux Fest, I'm going up to Keller

42:37.880 --> 42:40.160
and I'm gonna hang out at the Linux Academy for a bit.

42:40.160 --> 42:42.320
I'll be parked in their lot, boondocking there,

42:42.320 --> 42:45.560
doing shows and converting their broadcast systems

42:45.560 --> 42:46.960
over to Linux.

42:46.960 --> 42:49.280
And I think it's gonna be a ton of fun.

42:49.280 --> 42:50.760
It's gonna be super hot.

42:50.760 --> 42:53.480
But so that's like phase two of my trip.

42:53.480 --> 42:55.800
And then phase three will be the drive home,

42:55.800 --> 43:00.800
getting back up into Washington where I can't really,

43:00.960 --> 43:03.840
I can't even imagine it's like 65 degrees right now.

43:03.840 --> 43:05.600
It sounds so wonderful.

43:05.600 --> 43:07.560
But let's talk about Linux Academy before we keep going.

43:07.560 --> 43:10.040
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

43:10.040 --> 43:12.240
Go there to sign up for a free seven day trial

43:12.240 --> 43:13.880
and you can support the show.

43:13.880 --> 43:16.120
Linux Academy is going to be at Texas Linux Fest.

43:16.120 --> 43:18.000
In fact, if you go to their blog,

43:18.000 --> 43:21.920
they've posted their track, their schedules for Friday

43:21.920 --> 43:24.560
and Saturday and some information about how you can meet

43:24.560 --> 43:27.400
up with them and if you want to find me,

43:27.400 --> 43:29.800
a lot of my time at Texas Linux Fest is going to be

43:29.800 --> 43:31.000
at the Linux Academy booth.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.560
So that's sort of your surefire way to find me

43:32.560 --> 43:35.240
on the weekend if you're not in our telegram group.

43:35.240 --> 43:36.440
So check out Linux Academy.

43:36.440 --> 43:38.080
It's a platform to learn more about Linux

43:38.080 --> 43:40.320
and they're a company that's super passionate about it.

43:40.320 --> 43:42.760
They really started because they wanted to spread

43:42.760 --> 43:44.480
the word about Linux and Jupiter Broadcasting

43:44.480 --> 43:47.040
had already started a podcast network about Linux.

43:47.040 --> 43:48.960
Really, and they're like, well, how else can we do this?

43:48.960 --> 43:50.640
They got together with educators

43:50.640 --> 43:52.040
and they got together with developers

43:52.040 --> 43:54.200
and they created this platform that's just been growing

43:54.200 --> 43:57.480
and growing and gotten a ton of industry reception,

43:57.480 --> 44:00.400
like just super well-received, really well-respected.

44:00.400 --> 44:02.600
It's a name on the resume that matters

44:02.600 --> 44:04.400
and they have public profiles where you can demonstrate

44:04.400 --> 44:06.240
to potential hires or clients the things

44:06.240 --> 44:07.840
you've accomplished at Linux Academy.

44:07.840 --> 44:09.760
So go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged,

44:09.760 --> 44:12.520
get a seven day free trial and try out those hands-on labs.

44:12.520 --> 44:14.360
And if you want to know more about their Linux Fest

44:14.360 --> 44:18.160
Texas plans, well, then you can go over to their blog,

44:18.160 --> 44:21.480
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

44:21.480 --> 44:24.160
Okay, we have an inappropriate amount of apps.

44:24.160 --> 44:26.360
We have a disproportionate amount of app picks.

44:26.360 --> 44:27.600
People have been wanting app picks

44:27.600 --> 44:30.840
and holy crap, do we have some good ones.

44:30.840 --> 44:34.080
And I kind of have like a mix in here

44:34.080 --> 44:38.360
and Wes threw some in here and it's just, it's great.

44:38.360 --> 44:41.560
So let's start with ones that were put together

44:41.560 --> 44:45.960
by the one and only Martin Wimpress, Mr. Wimpy.

44:45.960 --> 44:48.640
So the first one is a snap that he put together,

44:48.640 --> 44:52.680
which is steam for windows, soaked in wine

44:52.680 --> 44:53.840
and all snapped up.

44:53.840 --> 44:55.680
So it's the windows version of wine

44:55.680 --> 44:57.840
or it's wine with the windows version of steam

44:57.840 --> 44:58.680
all ready to go.

44:58.680 --> 45:02.320
You install the single snap and it's steam for windows

45:02.320 --> 45:04.280
for Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian and all the other major

45:04.280 --> 45:06.480
Linux distributions that can run snap.

45:06.480 --> 45:07.400
So that's pretty great.

45:07.400 --> 45:10.280
Now the companion part to this snap

45:10.280 --> 45:13.040
is Trackmania Nations Forever,

45:13.040 --> 45:15.840
which has been soaked in wine and snapped for Linux.

45:15.840 --> 45:18.880
This is a racing game that might,

45:18.880 --> 45:21.360
if you saw it, it would look like a higher resolution,

45:21.360 --> 45:23.120
better looking version of Mario Kart.

45:23.120 --> 45:25.080
And it's a lot of fun

45:25.080 --> 45:26.760
and it's now available as a snap as well.

45:26.760 --> 45:30.400
I got kind of a gaming thing going a little bit this week.

45:30.400 --> 45:31.280
It's not all games,

45:31.280 --> 45:33.320
just a little bit of a gaming thing going this week

45:33.320 --> 45:35.440
because I just had an itch

45:35.440 --> 45:37.120
and Wimpy happened to put these together

45:37.120 --> 45:39.520
and I thought this whole idea is worth talking about

45:39.520 --> 45:42.520
where they've taken wine and they've taken steam

45:42.520 --> 45:44.360
and now a game and like you can,

45:44.360 --> 45:46.760
you can kind of build it all together like Lego blocks.

45:46.760 --> 45:48.000
Isn't that kind of neat?

45:48.000 --> 45:49.480
We're living in the future.

45:49.480 --> 45:50.840
This used to be so hard to do.

45:50.840 --> 45:52.320
You sort of had to know all the pieces

45:52.320 --> 45:54.200
that you needed to wire together.

45:54.200 --> 45:56.920
Just getting wine working right sometimes can be difficult.

45:56.920 --> 46:00.000
So all you need is snap and you probably already have it.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.160
If you are on the snap pipe train, then wow.

46:03.160 --> 46:04.000
Yeah.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.160
Okay, so this is the last gaming thing I have.

46:06.160 --> 46:08.160
Everything else is all serious stuff,

46:08.160 --> 46:10.840
but I wanted to mention Overload.

46:10.840 --> 46:13.280
It's on steam and gog.com.

46:13.280 --> 46:14.200
It's a $30 game.

46:14.200 --> 46:16.960
So right there up front, this isn't free.

46:16.960 --> 46:19.960
There's nothing about it that is open source,

46:19.960 --> 46:24.560
but this is a remake from the original creators

46:24.560 --> 46:26.640
of the classic game of Descent.

46:26.640 --> 46:30.520
It is Descent for 2018.

46:30.520 --> 46:32.640
Overload combines intense action

46:32.640 --> 46:34.600
with awesome graphics and effects

46:34.600 --> 46:37.360
to create the ultimate zero gravity shooter.

46:37.360 --> 46:40.080
So you're flying around in this cool little spaceship,

46:40.080 --> 46:42.440
flying through like mines and tunnels.

46:42.440 --> 46:45.520
It features an awesome single player story campaign.

46:45.520 --> 46:47.720
It has a survival mode, which is a lot of fun.

46:47.720 --> 46:51.440
They've brought online multiplayer and just for wimpy,

46:51.440 --> 46:53.920
they've also put VR support into it,

46:53.920 --> 46:55.960
as well as a bunch of customizations and stuff

46:55.960 --> 46:58.280
that were never really possible with the original game.

46:58.280 --> 47:00.840
I don't know if any of you guys ever played Descent.

47:00.840 --> 47:03.560
This is one of my all time favorite games growing up.

47:03.560 --> 47:06.280
Played this with my dad a whole bunch on the computer.

47:06.280 --> 47:10.740
It was one of the classics and now it's been reborn, Wes.

47:10.740 --> 47:13.560
Interesting, I have not played it, but it's reborn.

47:13.560 --> 47:16.200
I might just have to give it a go after the show.

47:16.200 --> 47:19.000
While you're just leaving away on the road,

47:19.000 --> 47:20.920
I'll be having a wonderful time gaming.

47:20.920 --> 47:23.720
GOG.com and it's also on Steam.

47:23.720 --> 47:26.160
I like it on GOG just because you can download the binary

47:26.160 --> 47:27.000
and you don't have to be logging in Steam.

47:27.000 --> 47:27.820
It's so easy.

47:27.820 --> 47:28.840
Yeah, nothing like that.

47:28.840 --> 47:30.400
All right, Geeta, I think is how you say this.

47:30.400 --> 47:32.200
It's get with a cup of tea.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.520
A painless, self-hosted git service.

47:34.520 --> 47:37.840
It's a community managed fork of GOGGS?

47:37.840 --> 47:40.320
What's, I'm assuming it's something written in GO,

47:40.320 --> 47:41.960
but do you know what GOGGS is, Wes?

47:41.960 --> 47:44.160
A painless, self-hosted git service.

47:44.160 --> 47:46.640
What, well then that's perfect.

47:46.640 --> 47:48.200
Yeah, this is something a little simpler

47:48.200 --> 47:50.560
than GitLab is kind of what I grokked, am I correct?

47:50.560 --> 47:52.400
Yeah, yeah, it's not so fully featured.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.720
It doesn't have all those enterprise things

47:54.720 --> 47:57.840
and a paid plan that you can get with support and all that,

47:57.840 --> 48:00.320
but if you just need somewhere to stick some code

48:00.320 --> 48:03.780
and file issues and manage releases and pull requests,

48:03.780 --> 48:04.620
it's got it.

48:04.620 --> 48:05.840
Yeah, that's kind of cool.

48:05.840 --> 48:10.840
At git.io, G-I-T-T.io, or I have a link in the show notes.

48:11.040 --> 48:13.080
And then this is the one you found this week

48:13.080 --> 48:14.800
and I'm like, oh man, I want this.

48:14.800 --> 48:16.400
Already I want to just mess with this.

48:16.400 --> 48:18.640
I don't have a chance while I'm on the road,

48:18.640 --> 48:19.900
but this looks really good.

48:19.900 --> 48:24.260
PulseAudio DLNA, a lightweight streaming server,

48:24.260 --> 48:26.560
which brings DLNA and universal plug and play

48:26.560 --> 48:31.560
and Chromecast support to PulseAudio on Linux.

48:31.560 --> 48:33.040
So once you get it all set up,

48:33.040 --> 48:36.000
it just detects the DLNA device or the Chromecast

48:36.000 --> 48:38.120
and they show up as a PulseAudio device

48:38.120 --> 48:40.760
that you can just set your output to.

48:40.760 --> 48:43.720
Or because PulseAudio is kind of cool these days,

48:43.720 --> 48:46.800
you could load Puva control and you could just say like,

48:46.800 --> 48:51.120
take Spotify and just send Spotify to the Chromecast.

48:51.120 --> 48:52.600
This was a great find, Wes.

48:52.600 --> 48:54.680
I know, it's actually super useful.

48:54.680 --> 48:57.800
I'm using it right now in case I need to get up.

48:57.800 --> 48:59.360
I've got my Chromecast loaded up with it.

48:59.360 --> 49:01.800
I've got you on it so I can get up, walk around the room,

49:01.800 --> 49:04.360
go grab another drink and still keep up with the show.

49:04.360 --> 49:05.500
That's how you did it.

49:05.500 --> 49:07.600
I noticed in the pre-show that when you got back

49:07.600 --> 49:10.440
with the beer, you knew what we were saying.

49:10.440 --> 49:12.280
You're using this right now?

49:12.280 --> 49:13.880
That's right, my secret is out.

49:13.880 --> 49:16.880
You clever dog, you clever dog.

49:16.880 --> 49:19.480
Yeah, so behind the scenes over the last few weeks,

49:19.480 --> 49:22.240
Wes built out a great little home studio

49:22.240 --> 49:25.000
that he can broadcast from while I'm on the road

49:25.000 --> 49:27.920
because why have him drive all the way up to the studio

49:27.920 --> 49:28.960
while I'm gone?

49:28.960 --> 49:31.360
Why, I mean, that's just, first of all,

49:31.360 --> 49:32.540
he's been doing that for so long,

49:32.540 --> 49:34.200
it's time to just take a break from doing that

49:34.200 --> 49:35.240
to begin with, but second of all,

49:35.240 --> 49:36.400
like when I'm not there, what's the point?

49:36.400 --> 49:37.360
Nobody's gonna be barbecuing.

49:37.360 --> 49:38.960
Yeah, the main attraction is gone.

49:38.960 --> 49:41.360
Yeah, so this is really cool.

49:41.360 --> 49:44.360
So I love how you're sort of making this space

49:44.360 --> 49:47.040
into like the ultimate Wes Payne broadcast setup

49:47.040 --> 49:48.440
because this little piece here,

49:48.440 --> 49:50.640
for people who don't really do shows

49:50.640 --> 49:51.600
that are live like this,

49:51.600 --> 49:53.640
like there's no stopping once this show starts.

49:53.640 --> 49:55.720
And so every now and then, you know, you gotta get up,

49:55.720 --> 49:57.400
you gotta get another beer, you gotta take a leak.

49:57.400 --> 50:00.120
Sometimes Chris is running his mouth for a bit.

50:00.120 --> 50:01.060
But you don't know what he says

50:01.060 --> 50:02.520
if you put down the headphones.

50:02.520 --> 50:03.960
So, but you did it right

50:03.960 --> 50:05.420
because I don't hear it in the background at all.

50:05.420 --> 50:06.680
So you gotta turn down enough

50:06.680 --> 50:08.420
where it's not getting picked up.

50:08.420 --> 50:09.360
So, well done.

50:09.360 --> 50:10.200
Thank you, sir.

50:10.200 --> 50:11.040
Is there much of a delay?

50:11.040 --> 50:12.400
No, it hasn't been too bad.

50:12.400 --> 50:14.840
I haven't tested anything that's like super synced up,

50:14.840 --> 50:15.660
right, for this use case.

50:15.660 --> 50:17.680
It just needs to be, you know, within a couple seconds.

50:17.680 --> 50:19.160
Yeah, and if you're doing something like music,

50:19.160 --> 50:21.960
you know, like Spotify or your local music library,

50:21.960 --> 50:23.920
you don't even care about any kind of latency.

50:23.920 --> 50:25.040
It's great for that.

50:25.040 --> 50:27.120
So again, it's PulseAudio, DLNA,

50:27.120 --> 50:30.120
and we'll have a link at linuxunplug.com slash 252.

50:30.120 --> 50:32.800
All right, now while we're in the terminal,

50:32.800 --> 50:35.680
let's take a look at WTF.

50:35.680 --> 50:39.540
Yep, WTF, a personal information dashboard for your terminal.

50:39.540 --> 50:44.200
And it is everything you would want from like a,

50:44.200 --> 50:47.080
like a, remember Google start page, their IG start page?

50:47.080 --> 50:48.200
Yeah, it's everything you'd want

50:48.200 --> 50:50.960
from like one of those old classic web portal pages

50:50.960 --> 50:53.520
where it gives you your calendar, your to-dos,

50:53.520 --> 50:55.480
last time you've chatted with your friends,

50:55.480 --> 50:58.240
in this case, some local log files, mail,

50:58.240 --> 51:02.640
recent GitHub check-ins, things like wifi status.

51:02.640 --> 51:06.600
This is a heads-up terminal-based dashboard

51:06.600 --> 51:09.680
that is like an overview of a lot of little things

51:09.680 --> 51:11.940
that you would want to check on from time to time,

51:11.940 --> 51:14.040
not all the time, but are very important.

51:14.040 --> 51:15.880
That's sort of how they describe themselves.

51:15.880 --> 51:19.920
So they have examples in here of like your to-dos

51:19.920 --> 51:22.620
and recent chats and all the kind of things

51:22.620 --> 51:24.440
you might want to just be able to take a glance at.

51:24.440 --> 51:26.600
It's just a, it's just honestly, guys,

51:26.600 --> 51:28.840
it's a badass looking terminal app, is really what it is.

51:28.840 --> 51:30.760
It's just a badass looking terminal app.

51:30.760 --> 51:32.560
And if you want something up on your screen,

51:32.560 --> 51:34.240
that looks awesome on your virtual desktop

51:34.240 --> 51:36.080
that you can switch over to super quick,

51:36.080 --> 51:37.320
I'm gonna say this is one of them.

51:37.320 --> 51:38.480
Yeah, if you have like an extra monitor

51:38.480 --> 51:39.880
that you just don't know what to do with,

51:39.880 --> 51:41.880
and you have a lot of things going in the terminal,

51:41.880 --> 51:43.200
you might as well just have this running.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.800
Yeah, yeah, so there you go.

51:44.800 --> 51:48.040
So Steam, Steam, Soaked in Wine,

51:48.040 --> 51:52.080
Trackmania Nations Forever, which is snapped up with Wine,

51:52.080 --> 51:56.160
Overload on GOG, Git T, which is a simpler GitLab

51:56.160 --> 51:59.760
alternative, GitHub alternative, PulseAudio DLNA,

51:59.760 --> 52:01.560
Lightweight Streaming Server, which brings DLNA

52:01.560 --> 52:03.440
and Universal Plug and Play and Chromecast support

52:03.440 --> 52:08.120
to PulseAudio and WTF, a personal information dashboard

52:08.120 --> 52:09.360
for your terminal.

52:09.360 --> 52:11.520
That's a strong list of, I don't think,

52:11.520 --> 52:13.600
I mean, that's more app picks than we really have any right

52:13.600 --> 52:15.840
put in a show, so go get links to all of those.

52:15.840 --> 52:18.280
Over in the show notes, now I did say I wanted to talk

52:18.280 --> 52:20.680
about the bigger question about what happens

52:20.680 --> 52:23.480
with Microsoft now owning Electron and the fact that

52:23.480 --> 52:27.080
really any major application that is an industry application

52:27.080 --> 52:28.920
that's come to Linux recently has pretty much

52:28.920 --> 52:30.040
been an Electron.

52:30.040 --> 52:32.440
Looking at you, Slack, and looking at you, Skype,

52:32.440 --> 52:34.240
and a whole bunch of others that are all based on Electron

52:34.240 --> 52:36.200
that we've talked about a lot on this show,

52:36.200 --> 52:40.000
Mailspring, and many more, IRC Cloud.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.280
Boy, I just got a whole bunch of Electron apps

52:41.280 --> 52:43.120
stuck in my throat, because it's like I have tons of them

52:43.120 --> 52:44.480
on my desktop or something.

52:44.480 --> 52:46.160
So before we go any further, I want to take a moment

52:46.160 --> 52:47.440
and I want to thank Ting.

52:47.440 --> 52:49.400
Ting's making this entire show possible right now,

52:49.400 --> 52:51.040
linux.ting.com.

52:51.040 --> 52:53.680
They are a mobile provider that makes sense.

52:53.680 --> 52:55.880
It's simple, you just pay for what you use.

52:55.880 --> 52:57.320
It's smarter than unlimited.

52:57.320 --> 52:59.160
You use less, you pay less.

52:59.160 --> 53:02.480
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

53:02.480 --> 53:06.160
And the reason why is it's $6 a month for your line,

53:06.160 --> 53:08.360
and then your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

53:08.360 --> 53:11.080
Whatever you use, that's what you pay for.

53:11.080 --> 53:12.760
They have nationwide coverage.

53:12.760 --> 53:14.760
They have CDMA and GSM.

53:14.760 --> 53:17.480
So yesterday, I was doing Koda Radio from the road,

53:17.480 --> 53:19.040
and I was on their CDMA network.

53:19.040 --> 53:21.000
It was just the better network in that area.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
I was kind of surprised.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.400
I thought it was going to be GSM.

53:23.400 --> 53:27.920
Today, where I'm at, I'm within throwing distance

53:27.920 --> 53:33.160
of a GSM tower, I'm getting unbelievable, unbelievable

53:33.160 --> 53:35.560
performance on their GSM network today.

53:35.560 --> 53:38.840
30 millisecond ping, which is great for a cellular connection.

53:38.840 --> 53:45.440
21 megabits down, 22 megabits up is what my Ting GSM connection

53:45.440 --> 53:46.160
is today.

53:46.160 --> 53:49.600
They are so perfect for somebody like me,

53:49.600 --> 53:53.560
because I don't really need my Ting data for almost any time

53:53.560 --> 53:55.960
during the year, except for moments like this.

53:55.960 --> 53:58.200
Then I can pick between their GSM or CDMA network.

53:58.200 --> 53:59.560
So you just pay for what you use.

53:59.560 --> 54:01.800
They have a great control panel to manage all of it.

54:01.800 --> 54:05.840
And they have a bunch of devices you can buy or bring directly.

54:05.840 --> 54:08.240
And they have a review up right now

54:08.240 --> 54:12.960
on their blog of the Moto G6, which is a sweet looking phone.

54:12.960 --> 54:15.800
It's $249 if you buy it from Ting directly.

54:15.800 --> 54:22.040
But if you go to linux.ting.com, you get it for like $224.

54:22.040 --> 54:23.920
This is a killer Moto phone.

54:23.920 --> 54:25.680
They have a review on their blog right now.

54:25.680 --> 54:27.440
Just a couple of things that stood out to me.

54:27.440 --> 54:28.760
It's got the headphone jack.

54:28.760 --> 54:31.360
It's got a 3,000 milliamp battery and turbo charging,

54:31.360 --> 54:34.600
so it charges in super quick minutes.

54:34.600 --> 54:37.440
It has a really nice 5.7 inch screen.

54:37.440 --> 54:40.040
It's got a 2.1, which is 18 by 9.

54:40.040 --> 54:41.160
I don't know the math on that.

54:41.160 --> 54:41.640
It's weird.

54:41.640 --> 54:45.080
Aspect ratio, nice, fast processor.

54:45.080 --> 54:47.360
And you have the ability to hook up

54:47.360 --> 54:48.920
Moto mods to this thing, too.

54:48.920 --> 54:50.040
It's a really cool looking phone.

54:50.040 --> 54:51.000
They have a review up on their blog.

54:51.000 --> 54:52.840
Start by going to linux.ting.com.

54:52.840 --> 54:55.640
You can bring a device, and you can get $25 in service credit

54:55.640 --> 54:57.200
or you can pick up a device.

54:57.200 --> 54:59.480
I, if I was searching for a phone right now,

54:59.480 --> 55:01.600
would seriously look at that Moto G6.

55:01.600 --> 55:04.320
For $224 when you go to linux.ting.com,

55:04.320 --> 55:07.200
that's a great deal, linux.ting.com.

55:07.200 --> 55:10.640
So how can Microsoft improve or evolve Electron?

55:10.640 --> 55:13.800
Now that they own GitHub and GitHub owns Electron,

55:13.800 --> 55:15.720
it's now a Microsoft product.

55:15.720 --> 55:18.880
And I have a couple of ideas on things

55:18.880 --> 55:21.200
that they could do to make Electron better,

55:21.200 --> 55:22.760
specifically for Linux, too.

55:22.760 --> 55:24.360
But I doubt those things will happen,

55:24.360 --> 55:26.400
but I might mention them as well.

55:26.400 --> 55:28.040
And I don't know about you, Wes.

55:28.040 --> 55:29.640
Did you have some before I jump off?

55:29.640 --> 55:32.880
Like, I don't want to just run with them,

55:32.880 --> 55:34.760
because I want to hear some of your ideas, too.

55:34.760 --> 55:36.260
But what do you think Microsoft could

55:36.260 --> 55:39.680
do to just improve upon Electron or maybe even just evolve it,

55:39.680 --> 55:41.280
like just reasonably make it better?

55:41.280 --> 55:42.200
That's a good question.

55:42.200 --> 55:44.960
There's a lot of potentials here.

55:44.960 --> 55:47.280
I think they do have a lot of experience at this,

55:47.280 --> 55:49.560
especially having built Visual Studio Code.

55:49.560 --> 55:52.040
I feel like they probably have some good opinions about what

55:52.040 --> 55:54.120
their limitations that they see with Electron

55:54.120 --> 55:58.320
is, and I will just say Visual Studio Code, it's a good editor.

55:58.320 --> 55:59.000
It's snappy.

55:59.000 --> 55:59.860
It may not be for everyone.

55:59.860 --> 56:01.240
I don't actually use it that much,

56:01.240 --> 56:03.680
but every time I have used it, it's

56:03.680 --> 56:05.000
been a really nice experience.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.760
So I think they're in a good place

56:06.760 --> 56:08.820
to just take care of it, to provide maintenance,

56:08.820 --> 56:13.400
to just generally improve it even in its current form.

56:13.400 --> 56:15.560
Some things I would like to see is

56:15.560 --> 56:17.800
there have been a couple of vulnerabilities in the past,

56:17.800 --> 56:20.440
so I think maybe a tighter eye on security,

56:20.440 --> 56:25.680
and just make it more minimal, as few resources as it can use.

56:25.680 --> 56:29.000
Find some clever ways to just make it less impact,

56:29.000 --> 56:30.960
because if we're all going to run like 10 of these

56:30.960 --> 56:34.880
all the time, I would like it to be a little skinnier.

56:34.880 --> 56:36.800
Maybe something more radical also

56:36.800 --> 56:38.920
is a huge amount of the appeal, right,

56:38.920 --> 56:40.280
is that you get to use technologies

56:40.280 --> 56:41.480
you're already familiar with.

56:41.480 --> 56:44.120
You get to use JavaScript, HTML, CSS,

56:44.120 --> 56:45.720
and so if you're already doing that,

56:45.720 --> 56:47.120
you're already building a web app.

56:47.120 --> 56:49.560
There's some other competing technologies in that space,

56:49.560 --> 56:52.680
things like React Native comes to mind in particular.

56:52.680 --> 56:54.600
So if they were able to keep some

56:54.600 --> 56:56.560
of the easy workflow of doing that,

56:56.560 --> 57:00.440
but then actually render more native components,

57:00.440 --> 57:02.360
that could be a huge win.

57:02.360 --> 57:04.880
So that's sort of in the lines of what I was kind of thinking

57:04.880 --> 57:06.160
they could do to it.

57:06.160 --> 57:08.560
And I could see this going a couple of different ways.

57:08.560 --> 57:12.140
I could see them changing it so that way you

57:12.140 --> 57:15.200
could have a modular back end, so it's not just Chromium.

57:15.200 --> 57:17.020
I mean, this is Microsoft after all.

57:17.020 --> 57:19.920
Maybe they'd make it so that way you could run Edge as a back

57:19.920 --> 57:20.400
end.

57:20.400 --> 57:22.400
Electron on Edge, yeah.

57:22.400 --> 57:25.440
Or maybe if it's modular, it could also

57:25.440 --> 57:29.120
support the Gecko engine or whatever

57:29.120 --> 57:31.000
Mozilla's engine is now.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.400
Because if they make it an interface or something

57:34.400 --> 57:36.480
like that, that could be kind of cool.

57:36.480 --> 57:40.960
You could even have maybe even some open source,

57:40.960 --> 57:43.960
other just smaller engines that maybe they're lighter weight,

57:43.960 --> 57:47.440
they're more purpose built that could make it safer.

57:47.440 --> 57:49.160
Because it's such a large attack vector.

57:49.160 --> 57:49.960
Yeah, exactly.

57:49.960 --> 57:51.020
You could just do minimal if you don't

57:51.020 --> 57:52.520
need all the fancy features or some

57:52.520 --> 57:54.840
of the performance of things like that if you could just

57:54.840 --> 57:56.880
have something smaller.

57:56.880 --> 57:57.600
Yeah.

57:57.600 --> 58:02.200
Or what about even maybe being able to use

58:02.200 --> 58:04.960
a different language altogether than, say, JavaScript?

58:04.960 --> 58:07.600
Maybe something, I mean, you could

58:07.600 --> 58:09.800
see how they could maybe do.NET Core, of course.

58:09.800 --> 58:12.960
But maybe it could also be something else,

58:12.960 --> 58:15.880
like, I don't know, my favorite Rust.

58:15.880 --> 58:18.640
That could be kind of a really big improvement is change

58:18.640 --> 58:20.140
some of the tooling that you're using

58:20.140 --> 58:24.040
to build these apps that are maybe a little safer tooling.

58:24.040 --> 58:25.640
I think multiple browser back ends,

58:25.640 --> 58:29.160
if you could decouple it somehow from Node and JS,

58:29.160 --> 58:31.600
I think that would be worthwhile.

58:31.600 --> 58:34.800
And I'm sure they'll come up with all kinds of other things

58:34.800 --> 58:36.380
that could potentially happen to it.

58:36.380 --> 58:38.940
But if anything dramatic happened,

58:38.940 --> 58:41.160
at the end of the day, it's an MIT licensed project.

58:41.160 --> 58:45.360
It could just, we could have free Electron or something.

58:45.360 --> 58:47.120
So there's not a big risk.

58:47.120 --> 58:49.320
Like, there kind of is with GitHub here,

58:49.320 --> 58:50.640
or like there was with Skype.

58:50.640 --> 58:53.640
Like, Skype is now a really different product

58:53.640 --> 58:55.640
than Skype was before Microsoft bought it.

58:55.640 --> 58:56.080
Yeah, right.

58:56.080 --> 58:57.660
But yeah, we don't have to worry about it.

58:57.660 --> 58:59.840
If they take Electron in a way that we don't like,

58:59.840 --> 59:01.480
well, we kind of don't like it already.

59:01.480 --> 59:03.640
And it's open source, so we can keep the version

59:03.640 --> 59:04.760
that we do tolerate.

59:04.760 --> 59:06.800
Yeah, I'd like to know the audience's ideas too,

59:06.800 --> 59:09.400
linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

59:09.400 --> 59:12.160
There's probably a lot of ways you can improve Electron,

59:12.160 --> 59:15.920
including I would love to see lighter weight backends

59:15.920 --> 59:18.560
and things like that, or even just more secure backends.

59:18.560 --> 59:20.880
But it's sort of the bigger, I feel

59:20.880 --> 59:22.960
like it's a bigger story for me personally,

59:22.960 --> 59:24.640
that they now control Electron.

59:24.640 --> 59:25.920
I'm not a GitHub user, really.

59:25.920 --> 59:27.180
I mean, obviously I have a GitHub account.

59:27.180 --> 59:28.880
We have some Jupyter broadcasting projects on there.

59:28.880 --> 59:30.880
But it's not part of my daily workflow.

59:30.880 --> 59:33.120
But Electron apps are part of my daily workflow.

59:33.120 --> 59:36.680
Like, significant changes there, for the better

59:36.680 --> 59:41.400
or for the worse, would directly impact my daily workflow.

59:41.400 --> 59:43.480
So it is one aspect of this purchase

59:43.480 --> 59:45.760
that I'm watching a little bit closer.

59:45.760 --> 59:47.640
And I'm a little spooked that so few people

59:47.640 --> 59:49.080
are kind of talking about it.

59:49.080 --> 59:50.480
I know it's only day two and stuff.

59:50.480 --> 59:53.160
But it seems like it should be at least a larger conversation.

59:53.160 --> 59:54.960
But everybody's so busy freaking out.

59:54.960 --> 59:56.080
And I think they're still in shock.

59:56.080 --> 59:56.720
Yeah.

59:56.720 --> 59:58.800
If I could write up a prescription though,

59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.440
I think you've made some good points.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.880
And I think I would say modular backend,

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:06.160
so that way Mozilla could maybe write a backend.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.120
And the open source desktops could perhaps

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.000
write a backend.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.080
WebKit could, instead of having Chromium,

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:13.080
it could be like a smaller, tinier WebKit backend,

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.320
perhaps, something like that.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.760
Yeah, anything to streamline it.

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:18.320
MumbleRoom, do you guys have any suggestions

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.160
on what could be done to improve Electron by Microsoft?

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.840
Or maybe how they'll mess it up too?

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.360
I mean, that's also open.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:25.920
Improvements to Electron?

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.120
It's almost a joke.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.600
You don't think it's possible?

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.240
That's why?

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:34.160
I mean, just kill Electron in the first place, please.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.320
Yeah, maybe.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:38.080
Well, maybe we'll see an exodus there too.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.200
As people are trying to exit out of GitHub,

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.640
maybe we'll see an exodus out of Electron.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.720
Doubt it, though.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.480
It seems like the momentum is already pretty strong there.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.040
All right.

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.120
Well, I think that's just about everything

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.320
we have for today's episode.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.600
Another on the road edition of the show,

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.440
which was much easier than last week.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.080
So much easier.

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.840
Our magical, unnamed, officially unnamed editor

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.800
did unbelievable work last week.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.120
Like, really just top notch.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.920
Yeah, if you heard the live show at all

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.600
and then caught the download, it didn't maybe

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.400
sound as good as it could have because I was

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.560
in a loud, echoey, tiny hotel room.

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:17.480
But it was a remarkable recovery based really

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:21.640
all on the skills of our unnamed, very, very good

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:22.120
editor.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.720
So thank you to whoever that may be who has yet to be named.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.520
You know who you are, and we are grateful.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.640
He's done a really good job on last week's episode.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.920
Anyways, thank you, everyone, for tuning in this week's episode

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:31.920
of the Unplugged program.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.480
We'd love to have you join us live.

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.240
We tend to do these shows right here on a Tuesday.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.000
It's kind of a Linux sandwich, because you've

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.600
got Ask Noah, who comes in right as we're kind of wrapping up.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:42.220
And the mumble room keeps rolling into that show.

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:43.960
The chat room keeps rolling into that show.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.360
And then he starts taking calls.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.520
And then who knows what happens.

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:48.640
I suppose that's up to you.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.240
So you can hang out with us, and then you

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.480
get a little Noah afterwards, sort of like your dessert,

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.880
your brown bear dessert, brown sugar.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:56.560
So I would love to have you join us.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.720
Go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:00.760
to send us your feedback.

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.300
I'm trying to remember all my URLs before we get out of here.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.880
Go to linuxunplugged.tv to watch it live.

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.520
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar for where you can

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.920
get it converted to your local time.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:09.920
You managed it.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:10.880
I know.

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.320
You know, Wes, it's because of you.

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.960
It's because of you, holding the fort down over there

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.160
in Seattle, keeping it real.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.960
I've got all my clocks set to West time right now.

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.480
So that way, you can keep me straight.

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.700
But thank you so much for tuning this week's episode

01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:23.120
of the Unplugged program.

01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:25.160
We'll see you right back here next week.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:37.760
And we'll see you soon.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:03:04.380
What about a way where you could, I didn't think about this in the show, but if you could

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:09.080
use the same backend for apps where the security made sense or you trusted it, so you could

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.480
just have less copies of all that stuff running.

01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:12.480
Oh, interesting.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.480
So it's like a shared backend, is what you mean?

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.480
Yeah.

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.240
Closer to just tabs in a browser, but maybe with some of the same integrations that we

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.240
like from Electron.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.240
You'd have to be careful.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.280
I don't know if it's feasible, but worth a shot.

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.880
Seems like it would reduce RAM usage too.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:25.880
Yeah, exactly.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:26.880
Yeah.

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:31.880
All right, JBtitles.com, let's name this thing and then I can turn on my air conditioning

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.880
and peel myself out of my chair.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:04:02.880
Oh, Texas.
