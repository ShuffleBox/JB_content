1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
We waited from California we left California at 1 a.m. and made it I mean

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,240
we made incredible time we made it through California Oregon and most of

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,620
Washington in one day. Wow do you guys trade off? Yeah you're totally smashing this

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,200
like internal opinion I have of you of a very sweet smelling man now. Well you

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,620
know all things said all things said I actually think I came out smelling like

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,480
roses really no real smell the hair got a little out of control but yeah so

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,560
that's why we didn't see much of you. If when if I do manage to get all these out

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,600
in Rover logs as the Rover log goes my hair goes from like combed to

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,240
progressively just a disaster because literally at one point I'm not joking

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,060
you on our way home we got stuck in a tornado in an RV and it was one of the

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,440
scariest things that's ever happened to me and so it just goes off the rails it

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,480
goes off the rails it's ridiculous it was a hell of a drive home. Where on the

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,880
west coast did you encounter a tornado? Yeah yeah Northern California Northern

14
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,160
California and it was no frickin joke it was I I literally thought I was going to

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,840
destroy my brand new home. Oh man. Hail the size of marbles at unbelievable

16
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,920
speeds it was. How did Rover to make it out? Well pretty good I think I mean

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,880
good I wouldn't I documented all of it so I'll put it all out in the Rover log

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,080
but it you know it's funny because we're driving down the road and we're

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,000
listening to a podcast and the stereo system switches over and there's this

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,800
piercing emergency sound that comes from the stereo it resets the volume it

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,360
resets it to the FM radio and they override your stereo system and you

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,280
start getting the if you are on the road take cover immediately this is an

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,640
emergency. I'm like holy crap! That's crazy. Yeah oh and Hadeah is sitting there driving

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,780
she was driving at that step at that point cuz we were trading off and she's

25
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,240
like should I keep going I kind of want to see it I'm like yeah let's keep going

26
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,360
let's see it. Think of the network Chris. And then as we start to see the big

27
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,680
semi-trucks bailing off the road and like taking refuge under overpasses I

28
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,600
start to realize this and then I start to I look ahead I'm like I I can't see

29
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,880
beyond a certain distance that's all just gray and and then I'm like pull

30
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,760
over pull over we gotta get off the road it was something I did not expect to run

31
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,120
into a tornado and and and they're like if you are in a high-profile vehicle or

32
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,160
a motorhome you may want to consider abandoning the vehicle like this what

33
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,120
they tell you on the radio broadcast because you're extra susceptible to the

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,600
wind right but the problem is the hail was so powerful and so fast and so

35
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,400
strong that you would have been seriously injured if you actually tried

36
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,320
to evacuate the vehicle so we couldn't evacuate your choice we had to stay in

37
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,720
this huge wind catcher there's a long tall wall that catches wind that's what

38
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,360
we had to stay in during the turn oh because we would have been I mean we

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,200
would have been seriously injured it was really something can I can I give you

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,000
some advice if you ever encounter tornado again yeah if you were watching

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,080
it and it doesn't appear moving get out of the way it's coming towards you hmm

42
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,040
yeah it was moving five five miles per hour across die five and one of the

43
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,760
things we thought about cuz where we had to park the whole vehicle was on level

44
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,800
right and so you're going through you're trying to just do everything you can but

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,880
the vehicle is really really off-kilter because we're hot we're half off the

46
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,880
road and like that makes us even more susceptible to wind to getting knocked

47
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,960
over right because we're sitting there leaning and so we're trying to decide

48
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,880
should we put the jacks down but of course the jacks are metal and there's

49
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,560
tons of lightning because it's a tornado and so I was like we can't put the jacks

50
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,000
down because then that would ground us because right now we're sitting on rubber

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,720
but the vehicles at a slant but so if we put the jacks down it would correct the

52
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,160
slant of the vehicle and make us more stable but the vehicle and if we got

53
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,400
struck by lightning we'd be really screwed so we stayed on the rubber it

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,640
was it was really something it was intense that sounds like quite the

55
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:59,680
moment yeah I'm glad I'm very thankful that we have you back on camera not all

56
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,160
of it but a lot so I was talking about the tornado just a second ago but the

57
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,560
other thing that worked out really really well is I pulled off at this

58
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,280
place called battle rock beach and it was in the middle of the night so I had

59
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,720
no idea what it was like I kind of I could tell because I couldn't see I

60
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,760
couldn't see off into the distance I thought this might be a great view so I

61
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,400
parked the rig down this is in Oregon on our way down to scale I parked it woke

62
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,080
up in the morning to this on that's beautiful look at this I went up I had

63
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,200
to go up and crawl up look at that that's not from the roof of the rover

64
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:42,200
there and I went out and I got some footage with the GoPro I got like some

65
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,640
super awesome that's that's I'm holding the GoPro there so that I have it on a

66
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,880
stable look at how happy you are so I took it up I took it up to the water now

67
00:04:50,880 --> 00:05:00,920
I did I got this shot from far away so yeah I'm sitting to get a shot of the ocean so

68
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,680
I got my boots a little wet for for good footage well it's worth it yeah yeah

69
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,720
that's all all in on the line of duty but that was turned out to be a great

70
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,800
spot on the way down yeah I mean you you know I don't even know if you can get a

71
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,020
hotel that nice yeah right that was waterfront pretty pretty just wandered

72
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,740
right down to the water made up for the tornado on the way back from scale oh so

73
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,920
this is on the way down yeah this is on the way down and really the the the

74
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,240
whole payoff was giving you see poppy who turns out to be a well-smelling

75
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,760
gentleman oh yeah I can confirm he does smell well in real life he caught me on

76
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,880
a good day I know I mean no no a conference when you're traveling not your

77
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,360
typical good day I because I'll tell you what happened to me total devastating

78
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,720
disaster we were moving from the old rover to the new rover lady Jupiter as

79
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,200
we call her and we moved everything except for the absolutely most

80
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:54,840
important things for a trip like this my mixer my microphone oh Chris and and

81
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:01,480
all of the toiletries all of it toothbrushes combs hair anything so

82
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,080
anything left it all so we got down and on the road and realized we didn't have

83
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:13,040
any of our stuff it was awful so poppy I congratulate you for making it over to

84
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,320
the west coast of the US of a and smelling like a gentleman with your

85
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,440
basic hygiene intact while at a conference that's a that is a true feat

86
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,520
I'll tell you what the the hotel we stayed in was okay and and as with all

87
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,160
many canonical events when there's more than a certain number of people we share

88
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,160
room so I shared a room with one of the other community guys Michael Hall and

89
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,520
you know we didn't the shower wasn't huge so squeezing us both in there

90
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:53,000
together was a little bit of a squash but you know we managed this is Linux

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:08,600
unplugged episode 129 for January 26 2016

92
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,040
well I'm gonna let it unplug your weekly Linux talk show that's recovered from

93
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,560
the scale hangover by drinking beer my name is Chris my name is what hey there

94
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,680
wasn't a good beer it is it sure is the sour one now coming up on this week's

95
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,720
episode of the unplugged show we don't have a sour show no no never have a

96
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,680
great show we're gonna have some updates from our friends on some of the projects

97
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,960
they've been working on in the Linux community then did you hear the big drama

98
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,000
around the Linux Foundation kicking out the individual contributor it's a big

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,560
hoopla we'll tell you what's going on who's spreading rumors and what the

100
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,520
reality likely is with the Linux Foundation then later on have you

101
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,160
wondered where the hell is Wayland wait what wait it's almost become a joke

102
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,320
Wayland hasn't shipped yet what I actually went back in the Linux

103
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,360
action to archives I went back as far as 2011 we were still making jokes that

104
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,800
Wayland wouldn't ship this year that means we probably predicted in 2009 it

105
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,280
would ship I mean that's it's a mess I'll explain why Wayland hasn't shipped

106
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,600
and it's not the reason you're thinking in fact if you're asking that question

107
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,680
you're asking the wrong question mm-hmm that's right that's right that's right

108
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,160
and then towards the end of the show this week West is best friends over at

109
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:23,120
AMD good buds at AMD I love those guys they have launched today GPU open GPU

110
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,040
open actually I don't know if it was launched today but they have launched

111
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,120
recently GPU open and we will talk about that as well as catch up on shenanigans

112
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,100
baby chat a little about scale and all of those goodies right here on the

113
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,000
unplugged show you know before we get rolling let's bring in that mumble room

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,960
our virtual log time appropriate greetings mumble room

115
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,360
greeting hello guys hello so I don't know if anybody out there in the

116
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,680
mumble land is drinking along with the show today but West brought in a real

117
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,880
sour beer this is a sour beer it's called wild sour and it's the Flanders red

118
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:08,800
product of the USA it's got a BA score of 82 has an APV an ABV of 6% this is a

119
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,360
really like it almost tastes like like the sour stuff that's in some sour foods

120
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,880
it's so sour but it's also got a really nice clean finish I like it a lot so

121
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,280
that's what we're drinking this week on the upload we've been doing the beer

122
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,860
thing to sort of encourage the community hangout aspect it's been fun so West we

123
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,880
have a big story to talk about that I I meant to cover in Linux action show last

124
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,080
week but the scale shenanigans totally got away with things and didn't get it

125
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,800
didn't get a chance to cover this and so I wanted to give a mention out to

126
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,320
Jonathan Thomas who shipped OpenShot 2.0 beta this has been the Kickstarter

127
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,800
project we've all been waiting for OpenShot 2.0 is a whole bunch of new

128
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,400
stuff whole bunch of it's the new UI look it's it's a whole bunch of fixes

129
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,120
he's been working on and Kickstarter backers are getting the update first

130
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,960
it's pretty exciting because you guys know I follow Linux editing pretty

131
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,560
closely and I still think it's a pretty bad state of affairs

132
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,240
together a little video let's check it out it's pretty cool look at that that's

133
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:16,000
him putting that out now I'll jump ahead a little bit here so you can get a basic

134
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,480
idea of what the UI looks like here it's it's nice and it's available it works on

135
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,200
Windows it's gonna work on the Mac and Linux of course he's showing it here

136
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,800
under Ubuntu

137
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:37,800
I I am hopeful I am hopeful I am I am not exactly I'm not exactly sure what to

138
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,120
expect yet still there's no binaries that I have found even though I'm a

139
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,760
Kickstarter backer I maybe I missed an email that's very possible I've been

140
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,520
traveling but the source code is on github right now in fact I think like

141
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,780
even 205 beta is up or something like that is up on github so you could go

142
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,400
get it right now it just doesn't include a lot of a lot of things you need to

143
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,920
make it all run but there is hope out there we have a couple of good video

144
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,640
editors they're in the works right now so I don't think open shots ready yet

145
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,680
but hey you know what it's great to finally see some code shipping after

146
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,760
quite a while after I can't even remember but I think it's I think it's

147
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:19,680
been a few years now yeah yeah so Poby welcome back from from the US of a how

148
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,120
was your visit do we treat you okay while you were over here oh yeah I had

149
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,360
an amazing time loved it absolutely that's great I asked pop I said so what

150
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,720
was one of the first things you did when you got here and he's like well I got

151
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,720
chicken wings of course yeah did you get beer with the chicken wings or just the

152
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,480
chicken of course found a nice little place called Barney's and had some

153
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,080
Belgian beer and chicken wings and that sorted me out real really good you know

154
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,400
is this is this your is this isn't your first visit to California is it no it's

155
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,640
first one to LA I've been to Palo Alto and Oakland and San Francisco so what

156
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,000
did you think what strikes you when you visit here I'm curious just from

157
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,800
somebody who doesn't really have that outsiders perspective when you get here

158
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,800
what even if it's been like even if you've had the revelation before what is

159
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,480
it that strikes you when you visit so customer service is the first thing like

160
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:16,680
it's night and day compared to the UK so over there in the US it feels like

161
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,680
people genuinely want to serve you well and for you to have a good time whereas

162
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,160
over here you'll get a surly person who doesn't give a shit whether you have a

163
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:31,160
good time and whether you enjoy your food or drink or whatever whereas over

164
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,480
there when we're in the bar all the waitresses are very friendly and the

165
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,680
waiters as well it was just I just had a really nice time and I feel like the

166
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,960
people are nice and genuine and Pasadena is a lovely lovely place yeah I was

167
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,640
really surprised by how great of a venue that was you know how convenient it was

168
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,720
to like really great food oh but Khan had an after-party at the Brazilian

169
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,480
barbecue which is what happened to be where we went for lunch that day it's

170
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,960
just an incredible venue really nice classy accessible but big enough to

171
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,800
host a large group and that was one of many places around the convention center

172
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,320
you could have gone to a different place every night and you know we and we

173
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,040
randomly chose most of them we didn't have to you know go looking for Yelp

174
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,360
reviews or anything we stumbled on this little Korean place which was a little

175
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,840
bit weird it was it was super cheap and the few food was part Korean part

176
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,280
Japanese so it's like sushi and Korean sake and stuff but all the while there

177
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:32,200
was a TV which was constantly streaming Korean pop music which was really weird

178
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,200
you know that so it's funny you say that there are a lot of Korean channels in

179
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,960
Pasadena because the the Lady Jupiter has a HD antenna that goes up oh one of

180
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,480
the first things I do now that I got this is I raised the it's like it's

181
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,320
awesome it's literally called the batwing antenna and you you sit there

182
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,880
and you crank it up and it goes up and it kind of looks like a batwing and I

183
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,720
tuned in about 30 non-english channels and about half of them were Korean it's

184
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,840
funny try that I couldn't take I couldn't take my eyes off the TV

185
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:06,320
I'm like holy crap look at this this is unbelievable yeah my cat had great time

186
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,840
Michael was there he he helped us out with the reservations at the meetup

187
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,840
Popey it was able to come and say hi to the meetup he made an appearance because

188
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,000
you know he was a working girl while while at convention well we all were in

189
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,320
a sense but I mean he had to go back and and do his business so how did that all

190
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,800
go for you was it a decent success would you do it again yeah totally I like the

191
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,640
so the you become was good because there were a few talks that I didn't know

192
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,600
about yeah stuff that I was I was interested in seeing so actually you

193
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,920
know as someone who's one of the old well partially one of the organizers and

194
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,880
I was giving a talk myself it was really nice for me to hear like what other

195
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,600
people in the community had to say and see a different perspective than you

196
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,200
know just the one from canonical tell me a little about your talk so I talked

197
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,400
about a service that I created so immediately before my talk Stuart

198
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,440
language talked about building services right on top of Ubuntu phone so rather

199
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,200
than just you know nagging us about when the next phone is going to be available

200
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,160
when you're moaning that there's no game center or something like that rather

201
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,360
than you moan about it why don't you build out there and build something

202
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,640
right so his talk was all about building something and that kind of dovetailed

203
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:20,320
nicely with my mine and his joint talk which was we built something so yeah it

204
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,960
was quite cool it was nice and I did a demo and it worked and that's always

205
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,440
nice yeah I had a webcam pointed at a phone in my house a few thousand miles

206
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:34,160
away just to prove that it was doing what it wanted to do so cool I've had

207
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,480
the foresight to set up a webcam before I left the house flying around the world

208
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,920
well I had a I had like five minutes to talk to Mark Shuttleworth and I asked

209
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,320
him if this is gonna be something that we're probably gonna keep doing he kind

210
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,800
of gave me a can't answer which I kind of gave him a hard time about but

211
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,880
essentially he said that that the the unconference format feels pretty good to

212
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,920
him and that this in-person thing and go and and and sort of riding along with

213
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,840
another conference seems like a no-brainer for them so I don't know

214
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,480
probably if you guys are gonna do something like ubi-con again but I

215
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,040
thought yeah I thought it was a big draw I saw I talked to a lot of people there

216
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,680
were there specifically to go to ubi-con so I think it's something you guys should

217
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,200
keep up with yeah the next one's gonna be in Europe I think Germany is the next

218
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,760
one towards the end of the year I think it might even be booked in for November

219
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,160
okay we'll probably alternate you know and have one in Europe one in the US and

220
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,240
then but the thing is it's not us as in canonical that organize them it's up to

221
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,420
the community if you want to have one you create one in your region and so

222
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,640
it will help you where we can how did that work exactly so the ubi-con that

223
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,600
happened at scale was set up by a virtual who is that who's who's talking

224
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,000
back to us all right Wes has got it Wes watching there it was the it was the

225
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,240
virtual user the virtual it was the real actual users group the physical users

226
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,000
group this sort of organized it how did that work exactly so the Southern

227
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,200
California Linux user groups and the and the local teams the Ubuntu community

228
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:09,760
teams are all really active and there many of them are involved in scale

229
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,640
anyway so it was very easy for them to you know organize things with scale and

230
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,360
get the venue and get the rooms booked and all that kind of stuff so they did

231
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,720
all the logistics and you know we have a stand in the expo area and all that at

232
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,160
scale as well and for the whole of life for ubi-con as well so it was very easy

233
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,640
for them to do that organization because they were already linked to an

234
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,080
existing event and I think that's where it probably pays off is if if you're in

235
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,120
a local area and there's already an event nearby you can tack one day or two

236
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,800
years old it's like a good relationship yeah yeah I mean it means you don't you

237
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,260
as a as a community person don't have to fork out for a you know huge venue

238
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,760
that's very expensive and that Pasadena Center is massively expensive it's

239
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,160
really really yeah well it's a nice venue so I would imagine it is yeah we

240
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,640
had a chance to chat with one of the organizers about the incredible ham

241
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,280
radio setup they have there just so that way the different organizers can

242
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,560
communicate really wow that's how they punch through some of the interferences

243
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,880
they use ham radio and it was so cool to hear them geek out about that and you

244
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,480
and then he pointed out where some of the antennas were if you look you can see

245
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,360
like they have and and the Pasadena Convention Center of course is

246
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,820
pre-wired they'd have antennas installed because this is like this is a common

247
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:24,000
thing I guess pretty neat pretty cool I mean it's a pretty big event I mean you

248
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,080
have to keep this in perspective it's being put on by the community right it's

249
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,160
not it's not O'Reilly media coming in and and organizing all of this it's not

250
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,720
the Linux Foundation that is organizing all of this it's the community and it's

251
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,160
still a huge event I think they said they had something like three thousand

252
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,960
six hundred people that was the number I heard two was 3600 that's just what I

253
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,400
was gonna add so it was a really cool thing I mean we're gonna go more in

254
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,360
detail than Linux action show but it was really neat to see there poppy and I

255
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,320
wouldn't even know to you and you know what we had a hell of a meetup hell of a

256
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:06,080
meetup it was it was pretty funny because we had 40 people RSVP or plus 40

257
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,040
plus people RSVP and so Micah 68 there in the chat room or was it no not Micah

258
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:16,240
he was Micah not Micah 60 a different Micah in the chat room realized well we

259
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,240
should probably give these people a heads up well at the time he gave them a

260
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,640
heads up it was only 20 on the meetup oh or something like that and then they

261
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,440
lost the reservation all together they lost it all together and so I get there

262
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,200
and I'm like it was a reservation for 20 but it's probably gonna be more than

263
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,880
that and then I'm like I should and then like five minutes go by and I'm like I

264
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,480
should probably let her know by more than that I mean double so let me

265
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,600
clarify but they never they never heard me after the number 20 they just went

266
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,960
with the number so and like party of 20 yeah we have 20 people coming yeah they

267
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,600
got 20 we need to set up a table for 20 like I heard them talking all the time

268
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,400
about 20 people I'm like and I kept like ma'am it's probably me more than like

269
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,760
40 eventually we just completely overtook their entire outer seating

270
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,240
area I mean I think it was like maybe 55 60 people I don't know how many people

271
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:10,640
Wow that's huge it was huge as well we went there a few times and yes the beer

272
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,080
the beer is good in there and the food was good yeah the yard house yeah they

273
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,440
had a great selection of beer great selection which was the rarity including

274
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,320
Ian from system 76 had me try this peanut butter beer that he got peanut

275
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,880
butter beer peanut butter beer oh and it was smooth it was real smooth I got a

276
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,080
little one chunky peanut butter beer I got some I got some yeah you don't I got

277
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,000
some strong Belgium ale I can't remember the name of it was now but it was really

278
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,840
good it was it was excellent hey you know something we've been talking about here

279
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,880
on this show I don't know I'm just I'm fascinated I key or Josh aren't here

280
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,360
today to talk about it with us but a lot going on with solace I don't know maybe

281
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,120
it's the way they communicate maybe it's the the brash goals that they have

282
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,680
something about this project I I'm just very visible right yeah and so they're

283
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,960
going out and making waves again and the folks over at softpedia have been really

284
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,080
I want to couch this conversation just saying they've been really making some

285
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,560
changes over at softpedia and I want to talk about that with you guys too

286
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,840
wimpy you're in here right I want to talk to you about this too but solo s is

287
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,560
going to be supported for the next couple of years this next version and so

288
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,720
there I guess they say they're gonna cry to squash I quote all bugs and I don't

289
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,680
know how the hell that's possible but alongside with their crutch and focus

290
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,400
for 1.1 we're also continuing our campaign of bug crushing we have crushed

291
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,600
22 bugs over the last week ranging from long string bugs that have been resolved

292
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,840
since budgie rewrite to recent ones that related to inclusions of git based

293
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,360
patches for new software in the repo so they're going through making supposedly

294
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,560
this next really super super solid West what would it take this is this is my

295
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:50,160
question to you what would it take for you to honestly and legitimately install

296
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,840
solace and run it on like this laptop or a work machine that you are gonna use

297
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,840
every single day what would it take I think it really probably comes down to

298
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,240
package availability I'm doing I'm gonna do a little bit of bit of work to get

299
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,360
the packages if I need to nothing crazy but if I can use the tools I expect day

300
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,560
to day you know you know even if it's like a compiling or something akin yeah

301
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,640
so it sounds like the barrier is not high yeah no I mean everything looks

302
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,000
nice I'd have to play around with budgie a little more to see if it met you know

303
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,680
like my workflow but I assume I could change that if I is anybody in the

304
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,880
mumble room using this as their daily driver right now yeah that's a good

305
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,840
question it doesn't sound like it I don't think it's reached that level yet

306
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:31,000
all right maybe when this 1.1 comes out I'll step up and put it on this laptop I

307
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,800
don't want to I don't I don't really know I don't know how to I don't want to

308
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,880
use that there's a lot of softpedia shame online a lot of people don't like

309
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,680
softpedia yep and as somebody who just takes on a lot of news sources I just

310
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,680
sort of weigh each article on its own merits and I sort of build sort of a you

311
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,600
know following with an author those kinds of things and so for me it's not

312
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,160
so much about where you publish it's more about what you publish but

313
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,480
regardless softpedia has a hell of a name and not necessarily a good one at

314
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,760
that and I've been watching their coverage recently and I don't actually

315
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,720
know of another outlet out there say maybe for Onyx that is actually as

316
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,320
closely following less headline-grabbing projects that do deserve attention and

317
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,840
and they're also following projects to do deserve attention but I find I find

318
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,240
that they're actually in some cases contacting the distro makers and getting

319
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,080
quotes and actually verifying things which why that sounds like real

320
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,880
reporting yeah and I'm wondering wimpy I know I've seen a lot of articles from

321
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,440
them about Mate edition I'm wondering what your experience has been on the end

322
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,640
of the person getting reported on and what your experience because that's

323
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,920
that's a pretty valuable perspective yes softpedia certainly strike me as an

324
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:49,280
outlet that are far more grassroots community focused so they are paying

325
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:56,880
attention to a broader range of Linux news that appeals to probably more the

326
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,560
enthusiast you don't see so much of sort of where the enterprise stuff it's sort

327
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:07,760
of you know more that's a good desktop and mobile and yes in the past they have

328
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:14,600
contacted me directly to clarify things prior to putting stuff out but in the

329
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:25,320
main they like to be first to report on things so you know there yes it depends

330
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,160
whether it's a big story and they want to be first or if it's something new and

331
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:35,000
they want to be you know accurate it varies but also I forget his surname

332
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:43,320
swap nil from used to be mucked where and Linux Vader he writes for various

333
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,840
places he's very good as well if he wants to cover a story he's very thorough

334
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,840
he sets up a a Google Doc and gets all of the involved parties together and has

335
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,280
a whole question and answer and has various people come in and actually sort

336
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,880
of write their responses and then he brings that all together so he's the

337
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,960
most journalistic of the people that I've encountered that really goes to

338
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,240
people and gets gets not just copy off the website but actually wow you know

339
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:19,000
what was his name again would be oh I'm sorry I missed it yeah of course I know

340
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,960
that scale actually yeah a whole bunch of us from a bunch of those like eight

341
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,520
of us sat around a table yeah I love the picture you got of you guys crossing the

342
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,960
street he posted that to Google Plus that I hate that photo you look like

343
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,400
you're contemplating and looking ahead to the future thinking about converge

344
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,240
devices is a great shot of you I think I was just trying not to get run over yeah

345
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,000
but yeah okay yeah I told him you know the problem with swap me is is when I'm

346
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,920
now I'm already doing it right now is I want to say swap when I say his name so

347
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,360
that's that's really the big problem is I just want to call him swap but yeah

348
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,760
yeah you don't need swap nail if you have two gigs around but I'm bummed

349
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:08,240
anyway so yeah I agree that that is it's a see softpedia take a step up is nice

350
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,640
hopefully here's that here's the photo I was talking about hopefully look at it

351
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,520
that's poppy there in the in the jacket with the third over from the left

352
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,320
beautiful that's a great shot it really is look at look at that that's the that's

353
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,520
what needs a boon to crew crossing the street sort of in an echo of the good

354
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,240
the famous Beatles shot I think that's pretty good that's pretty good shot so

355
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,920
there's only one thing I would say about swap nil is that when he made that that

356
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:43,320
mucked where version of the onion was really annoying because he had it was

357
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,920
mugged where was both news and fake news oh it was kind of like it's difficult

358
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:55,040
why is like why are you purposefully creating noise there is a much

359
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,440
discussion to be had there but that said I would I would encourage people you

360
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,200
know just just sort of reconsider from time to time and can take each article

361
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,260
in its own perspective and of course Linux action show that reddit.com is a

362
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:10,320
great place to discuss the merits of an article because I do read those comments

363
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,680
and weigh them when I'm thinking about covering a story so yeah I have found

364
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,040
them their coverage to be interesting it's it's been something I've been

365
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,080
starting to visit on a reoccurring basis oh it's good to see better you know more

366
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,280
and better Linux news coverage yeah sure you're sure very much so you know what

367
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,440
else is new better and always getting better that's our friends over Digital

389
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,120
Digital Ocean is their awesome support of Linux working upstream all SSD drives

00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,720
and this incredible interface mmm I love this interface which the only thing

391
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,720
better about this interface the only thing better is the API oh man that API

392
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,160
holy cow the API is straightforward but the nice thing about it and I'm gonna

393
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,440
tell you where sometimes I hit the lazy button see what I do here as I go over

394
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,240
to this community page and just go to community and then you go to projects

and you're like I want to have a project right no no this is where you go to find

396
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,760
a whole bunch of really good open source code already written around that Digital

397
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,180
Ocean API and there is tons of stuff you can take advantage of right now I'd be

398

scrolling if you're watching the video version oh did you see that I was just using the

399
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,360
vagrant integration the other day really yeah how so why spend up a VM on my local

400
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,480
machine when I can get one in the cloud for so cheap right totally totally they

401
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,800
in fact they even have hourly pricing and on top of all of that with one-click

00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,320
supporting the show with deal unplugged digital ocean.com thanks guys all right

413
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,920
it is almost it's almost a joke now where in the world is Wayland and it's

414
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:28,240
always like is it ever gonna ship and I I will admit have having fully

415
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,800
participated in the joke I was gonna play a clip for you guys where where we

416
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:37,280
predicted Wayland would ship to show you just a bit of context how long we have

417
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,280
been expecting Wayland to be the default display server and this is sort of we

418
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:47,560
go off the rails but bear with me for a second best I could estimate I think in

419
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:53,960
2009 about our 2010 actually I think was 2010 2010 I said it would be default in

420
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,480
2011 in 2012 in 2013 I made a joke prediction as well as did Brian and Matt

421
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,720
at those times that Wayland would still not be shipping and no one would care

422
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,800
and it has sort of been the joke prediction in our show for so many years

423
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,520
that we stopped making the joke it's still a joke I heard the joke at scale

424
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,240
and the problem is it's actually completely and totally the wrong

425
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,440
question the question really isn't is Wayland ready yet that's not really what

426
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,940
you should be asking the better question is is gnome ready yet or is Kaywin ready

427
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,040
yet because I mean yes it's been it's there has been work that needs to happen

428
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,440
on Wayland but Wayland itself is a protocol I'm gonna get more than a

429
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,040
second but the blog post here from the gnome blog and I'm forgetting the

430
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:43,040
person's name right now because you know he says it's been our goal now for a

431
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,400
while to get to a point where Wayland could be declared complete and ready to

432
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,120
be enabled by default we've come a long way since starting the porting effort in

433
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,960
2013 in fact we feel we're close enough that we can aim for Wayland by default

434
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,880
in fedora 24 so this is you know something that's been everybody's been

435
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,960
talking about for quite a while now for you know getting Wayland by default

436
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,320
there's been a lot of work fixing things like dialog boxes and pop-ups and

437
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,800
applications GTK plus has had a lot of work that's gone into it kinetic

438
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,960
scrolling now works better under Wayland drag-and-drop now works under Wayland

439
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,960
copy and paste is getting close in a lot of cases but this isn't the problem see

440
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,880
what we what what this is what you have to understand the question isn't really

441
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,080
is Wayland ready yet that doesn't make a lot of sense Wayland is a communication

442
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,360
protocol and says very little about the implementation of the two sides you want

443
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,680
to communicate say your web browser a compositor the protocol is stable and

444
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,520
has been for a while but not every compositor and or toolkit or

445
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:44,220
application speak Wayland yet so it may not be sufficient for your use case so

446
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:48,280
rather than asking is Wayland ready yet you should be asking can I run gnome or

447
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:53,560
KDE or enlightenment under Wayland are they talking Wayland yet because they

448
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:57,360
have to be their own compositor now they have to do that on work they have to be

449
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,080
their own servers talking Wayland to the client application like all this stuff

450
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,120
now has to be implemented the burdens on them it's just not done yet it's not

451
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,480
ready yet but we still talk about it like if Wayland isn't shipping Wayland

452
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,920
shipped everybody news alert right here today breaking news on the unplug

453
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:21,840
program this is CNN breaking news Wayland shipped it shipped a while ago

454
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,200
one it's it's done the problem is graphics drivers aren't ready the

455
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,080
desktop environments aren't ready all of our little esoteric applications aren't

456
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:35,240
ready yet we're not ready Wayland is here it's good yeah I mean so I I wanted

457
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,720
to just sort of talk about this for a second because it's sort of I heard it

458
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,640
come up at scale I've seen it online a million times I there's a blog post

459
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,080
about it right now why aren't we shipping Wayland yet I've even I've even

460
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,680
participated in it and we're in the reality it's just that it showed up and

461
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,120
we weren't ready for it it's kind of what it feels like I don't know I think

462
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,400
I think what the author says here at the bottom that there are exceptions you

463
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,040
know that the protocol does still need a few things to be worked out in a way

464
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,800
that's not into implementation defined you know so we want to make sure that

465
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,520
KDE and GNOME don't do disparate things where the protocol is maybe lacking

466
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,060
clarification or lacking definition right right so and I wonder too in a

467
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:18,920
world where the Linux desktop is already not you know like a primary citizen how

468
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,120
much capability we can sacrifice the transition and still make it work so you

469
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,840
mean like you mean like if we don't get it right right like if copy and paste

470
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:31,280
almost works well how many people who use Mac or Windows can deal with not

471
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,900
having copy and paste right so I don't know I think we're getting really close

472
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:40,440
I think that this is a good a very good point and that you know we are already

473
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,920
seen like knowing I love when we see the updates from the GNOME team in the KDE

474
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,720
team about how far they're compositing their window managers are coming

475
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,520
especially the KDE updates but no kids and you think that's indicative of maybe

476
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,480
a systemic problem in the desktop projects themselves or the communities

477
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,400
what do you mean possibly it just seems like at least one of the desktops would

478
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,240
have it fully working by now since you know it's already shipped it's been

479
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:10,240
shipping for what six months about a year now I'm just kind of surprised that

480
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,040
like the X standards where they got together and all agreed on certain

481
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,840
standards or for like the icons etc drag and drop copy paste all that stuff there

482
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:27,000
was actually a huge foundation that was created just for that why don't they do

483
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,840
the same thing for Wayland I thought it was kind of being put on by the same

484
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,320
people I thought was my understanding heavens I want to give you a chance to

485
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,760
jump in just before we go too much further go ahead

486
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,400
yeah I mean those are really easy or simple reason why people who seem to

487
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,480
think of Wayland as a thing because our old X server was a server and I think

488
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,360
which had to run which Wayland doesn't need to run it's just a protocol for the

489
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,520
window manager it doesn't yeah window manager to actually manage and uses use

490
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:04,360
its compositor through so based on the x386 migrating to the X or server if

491
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:09,440
people just confuse it that way also we're going to secure by default which

492
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,600
is why something is weird as copy and paste or moving things between one

493
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,480
composited window to another secure positive like composited right no right

494
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,320
it's a little bit tricky well the X server is insecure and root horror right

495
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,880
that's actually so we were talking about the copy pasting the problem is is these

496
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,800
are all isolated protected applications now and so we've grown used to not

497
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,560
having the security yeah yeah so sharing data between them is tricky William go

498
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,720
ahead I want you to get a chance to jump in yeah so I don't think it's so much the

499
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,120
desktops holding it back because no actually has pretty decent Wayland

500
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:46,440
support if you use say the latest fedora image so it's mostly graphics drivers at

501
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,520
this point right yeah it works fine on Intel for the most part but yeah yeah

502
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,640
still missing complete open GL ES support which I need for Wayland to run

503
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:01,240
yes nobody's buying a thousand dollar plus computer and saying I don't need my

504
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,960
GPU let's I mean right maybe some of the most hardcore open source advocates are

505
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,280
but the majority of consumers are not going to buy a computer with a $300 part

506
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,160
in it and be like I don't need that right you could get iris pro graphics

507
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:18,000
that work though yeah some people are totally happy with the Intel graphics my

508
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,560
issue with Intel graphics remains once you put them in a high DPI environment

509
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,880
that you again feel the immediate crippling of integrated graphics if you

510
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,120
use in a 1080p environment or even a 2k environment iris would probably work for

511
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:36,120
people who don't play games a lot yep but yeah in the high DPI it's just it's

512
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:41,680
awful this is really this is really something that I I find to be fascinating

513
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,480
now wimpy what is the Maui project I know I've heard the name for is that

514
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:51,160
like Rebecca of black Linux what is this no no it's Maui is the operating system

515
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:57,800
and I think it's the Hawaii desktop or something yeah yeah they they took the

516
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:03,760
Western reference compositor and that and then built up our sort of a lightweight

517
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:10,800
desktop environment around it and it's the only aside from gnome 3 which is

518
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,320
sort of adapted from X to Wayland this is the only desktop environment that was

519
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:23,480
focused on Wayland from the outset now I don't know who actually had a chance

520
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,280
to install it but I think we actually talked about this about a year ago so

521
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,640
has this been around for a while because I think we yeah I've been aware of it

522
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:40,560
for a few years because okay now I think you brought up an important point when

523
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,680
describing it is so you've guys and you guys out there have heard of Wayland

524
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,040
obviously the only thing you often hear about is Weston Weston is a reference

525
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,080
compositor Weston is not really something it's not like it's not

526
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,520
something the K wing developers are going to use it's not something the

527
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,280
gnome people are going to use it's it was a reference point that's what

528
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,160
Western is and that's been done for a while too right now what are you gonna

529
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,200
make I was gonna say here's another Wayland focus environment that is

530
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,040
supposed to be a drop-in replacement for the i3 window is that what is this

531
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:13,360
called here yes way window manager sway WM yeah point look at this so I mean I

532
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,920
think is these things come along power users maybe right you know if there's a

533
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,720
nice styling window manager maybe I can do with Wayland right now yeah and

534
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,440
we're watching a little demo they have a little demo video up under our dinner

535
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,760
website dear that doesn't look pretty good so this is this and then maybe MP

536
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,920
MP plays with zero look at that it's kind of smooth too it actually has some

537
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,800
this is kind of nice yeah right I might give this a try this could be a

538
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,520
legitimate way to get into Wayland a little sooner and not expect all of the

539
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,280
features of such a rich desktop environment like no and you could

540
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,500
probably have this as one of your logins right you know from your display manager

541
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,720
and then go back to X if you needed you know he's playing video there in that

542
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,840
one in that one window there's no tearing there no it looks beautiful yeah

543
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,400
the dream let's put a link to this in the dock I'll put a in this we can have

544
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,640
that in the show notes that's pretty cool if you guys want to check that out

545
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,400
so it's a tiling window I do you call it a window manager now yeah that's what

546
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,240
it's their window manager so okay it's actually a successor to i3 because I

547
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,480
three team said they weren't gonna make a sofa Wayland version so that's one

548
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,960
and and it says that they bring in I your i3 configuration file so it has i3

549
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,120
configuration and I three IPC compatibility which would probably mean

550
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,240
like some of those plugins and stuff which is super cool and also multi head

551
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,640
support so and gap support which I know you had to compile in step or is that

552
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,320
for like in the monitor no like between your tiles if you don't want them right

553
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,360
next to each other you can have a little window gap between oh that's gonna look

554
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,080
pretty if you want to see you know you guys have wanted me to take a tiled

555
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,920
window manager challenge for a while this is the way for it to give me in now

556
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,080
now I'm like this is yeah this is really cool so yeah drop in replacement for i3

557
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,040
window manager but for Wayland instead it will work with your existing i3

558
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,120
configuration files and adds a few extra features on top of that and the other

559
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,960
thing I don't know what the state of multi monitor support is for like kwin

560
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,680
and no I'm sure it's like probably depends on the driver

561
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,200
hmm North Ranger yeah go ahead yeah I think you know we're finally getting to

562
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,600
a point of critical mass with Wayland where the whole ecosystem around it and

563
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,120
that's really what we've been waiting for for a long time as everybody's

564
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,320
alluded to it's drivers desktop environments it's the apps and we've

565
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,440
been through this kind of thing before I mean there was a long time ago and

566
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,840
Linux kernel was at 2.2 and you know people didn't trust you know kernel 2.4

567
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,400
for a long time you know so early adopters were hitting it first you know

568
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,560
things like that same thing with file systems and you know so I think there's

569
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,480
a lot of similarities there and you know overall I'm hopeful and I think we're

570
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,800
are reaching that tipping point where people want the security that comes with

571
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,920
Wayland you know the performance is pretty much a wash and you know we're

572
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,960
finally getting that decent support from the drivers and the ecosystem side yeah

573
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,560
I really hope that does pan out I'm still waiting but for mine but yeah I

574
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,760
definitely am ready to not see when I full screen video to see tearing right

575
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,680
so I was done with that video first class under Linux yeah I would love that

576
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,760
and and you know just the just it just this the sense of knowing that I'm using

577
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:11,880
something that's not so archaic like there's no material impact other than I

578
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,960
guess my my security is probably not as good as it should be right but I would

579
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,480
I'm ready to move on you know all right anybody else in the member of have any

580
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,880
closing thoughts on on the Wayland stuff before we move on do you really think

581
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:29,400
Wayland's about to be heralded in I still feel like it's a long way away hmm

582
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:36,760
I mean for example in the last few years whilst Wayland's being brewing we've all

583
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:43,560
been spoiled with steam yeah and while we don't have proprietary driver support

584
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:50,880
for Wayland I can't see people who have embraced steam on their Linux work

585
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:58,840
stations wanting to switch anytime soon no I you know the X the X shim the X

586
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,840
Wayland thing is not what that's for anyway but see this is the thing though

587
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:07,560
games you're gonna want the best performance possible I I know that the

588
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,000
next series that brings up that whole debate about you know how should Linux

589
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,800
do games should we have a way in the protocols right to give games there is

590
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,760
that when it comes to Wayland and KDE and GNOME it's up to KDE and GNOME to

591
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,960
actually get this implemented and deployed it's not Wayland themselves

592
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,840
which can actually deploy something and get everyone on it it's built in to the

593
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,280
best I guess the question there would be is there protocol implementations that

594
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,480
can make to make gaming better it's not about making gaming better and I don't

595
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,120
think that GNOME and KDE can be faulted because they've both been working very

596
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:47,560
hard on bringing them to desktop environments they've been too busy what

597
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:53,040
is it making their desktops actually usable and getting all the ironing all

598
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,600
the bugs out from their new three dot what ten releases KD 50 releases once

599
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,260
they get all these bugs and things wrinkles smoothed out from their new

600
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:06,440
desktop environment implementations you can finally focus on something that is

601
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,360
on a back burner which is Wayland support I would say no I disagree I

602
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,640
disagree because what's actually been happening is that the toolkits have been

603
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,400
evolving and therefore the desktop environments that built on top of those

604
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,560
toolkits have been evolving alongside those and that work has been moving on

605
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,960
at quite a pace if you actually look at the amount of effort that's gone into

606
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,520
supporting Wayland on KDE and GNOME 3 there's been a lot of effort and they're

607
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,920
both very close and they've both got implementations where you can run both

608
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,760
their desktops on top of Wayland but that's not the issue and the issue is

609
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,840
also not whether games will run better on Wayland or if there's protocol

610
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:55,480
support for in optimizing Wayland support for running games it's the

611
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:01,120
drivers we've got Intel support which is fairly decent but without the

612
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:06,600
proprietary driver support to give that performance that's required for gaming

613
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,240
and 3d and what-have-you people won't make the switch well here's here I see

614
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:17,040
two things that sort of our hedges in our favor the first being obviously

615
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,580
SteamOS I mean valve has the final say on what

616
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:25,040
ships on SteamOS and they can continue to use x11 for as long as they want or

617
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,560
they can build that some sort of shim something like that but I am I am

618
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:34,360
encouraged by the news I saw today that the next serious Sam game is going to

619
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:40,520
ship supporting Vulkan out of the box and really what the question is is what

620
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,240
we need the way we need things to line up is we need game developers to support

621
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,680
Vulkan and then we just need the Linux drivers to have good Vulkan support and

622
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,080
Wayland support not and if we can sort of all if everybody's interest and

623
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:59,160
priorities can align this way we're in pretty good shape and the thing is a lot

624
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,440
of priorities and interests are beginning to align this way already the

625
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,200
slow pivot yeah so Vulkan could be an answer to that and I think SteamOS is

626
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,680
our short-term hedge while this stuff is sort of sorted out because that's not

627
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,440
going to ship what valve doesn't want ship yeah but but the thing is is that

628
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:22,720
Vulkan has come along while Wayland has been and I'm not sure there's any

629
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:30,120
provision in Wayland for Vulkan at the moment I could wrong about that cuz I

630
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:34,160
haven't looked into it to care and I'm not entirely sure if it matters it

631
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,720
doesn't matter there's no reason why you would want at a display server level to

632
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,320
be concerned with something that would be interpreted by the driver and then

633
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:50,120
rendered out that way hmm boy you know what surely surely you need for example

634
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:56,440
for Wayland to let's just go back to GL open GL surely you need Wayland to

635
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,880
understand the open GL extensions for it to be able to render those things and in

636
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,680
the same way surely it needs to be able to do that for Vulkan as well that that

637
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,360
would be done by the drivers and stacks on top of them that's usually done by

638
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:17,320
Mesa now as to what protocol it uses to go into to use this with that's not so

639
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:23,920
sure I think Wayland needs to be able to interpret some of those extensions no it

640
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,360
really doesn't because all it's going to do the client of Wayland is it's going

641
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,880
to ask for an open GL buffer and I think you can still speak Vulkan over that I

642
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,920
think you can still upgrade that to be Vulkan compatible and it will just

643
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,600
render it within that frame that it was dictated by the Western compositor well

644
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,040
one of us is wrong I would be I would actually bet I would actually bet that

645
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,400
the answer lies somewhere in the in the middle because it seems it seems too

646
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:57,100
clean one way and it seems too ambiguous the other but I I will link to the

647
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:00,880
thread that you just put in the chat room West there is a Linux gaming thread

648
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,640
about how Vulkan will impact open-source drivers and I think they

649
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:10,040
get into Wayland in here we are about to go through a massive transition and the

650
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:14,480
closer we get to this the more and more obvious it is why why valve was very

651
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,560
very smart and thinking ahead when they decided to release steam OS because

652
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,680
they're like this is a great platform for us to target but and you know they

653
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,560
had to know about this stuff coming up I mean you don't choose Linux as a

654
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,960
platform without following what's happening and maybe that because they

655
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,000
now have so much skin in this game maybe they will be incentivized to work with

656
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,920
whoever they need to work with to make this an easier transition for us put

657
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,600
pressure on game developers to support these newer we could be so lucky right

658
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,880
isn't that the positive side of commercial interest using Linux we could

659
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,520
be so lucky yeah I wonder I will find out I wish we had a crystal ball right

660
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,280
now but I people in the chat room are saying that you know fedora 24 is is

661
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,920
with with Wayland is apart is real and is possible right now kits and I'll give

662
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,440
you the last word on performance and reliability then we'll wrap it up go

663
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:09,960
ahead yeah I've actually been using Wayland quite a lot as a driver on the

664
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,240
most recent fedora release really I think fedora should have just jumped in

665
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:21,400
release their current release with Wayland and said hey you know we were

666
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,680
all about promoting you know future technologies this is what we do this is

667
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:33,960
what this distro is about and I think did you go away gets him oh he went away

668
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:37,080
I thought he was making a good point essentially I think what his point is is

669
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,320
that because fedora is a cutting-edge distro it's the place to try it well

670
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,680
that's probably we are gonna see it first the outlook is good for the

671
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,200
eight-ball this is the j-bot eight-ball in the chat room there you go there you

672
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,160
go hey that is the decider that's the final word on them but that's it kids

673
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:56,360
and got a good point and I think when it comes time to do our fedora review and

674
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,960
my ex PS has an Intel Iris grounds car that was mm-hmm Chris's new Wayland

675
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,480
machine hey yo tell you what else is new my friends over at ting got some new

676
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,400
sales I'll tell you about here in just a second but first why you should switch

677
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,860
to ting I love it I use ting all the way down to scale and back and let me tell

678
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:16,900
you it is nice to know that ting is mobile that is finally different no

679
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,100
contract no real termination fee and you only pay for what you use six dollars

680
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:24,080
for your line pay for what you use so you go down to a trip to California

681
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,720
maybe use a little more a little more data on your way down on your way up no

682
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,600
bigs cuz you know what now I'm back here at the JB one headquarters I'm on the

683
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,760
Wi-Fi is Wes I'm on the Wi-Fi so it all is no bigs though my bill is cray-cray

684
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,600
with three smartphones is cray-cray cray-cray low whoa hey oh yeah like like

685
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:46,240
the like December was like 27 bucks oh that's like one meal out yeah the

686
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,360
average ting bill I guess per line is like $23 so think about a way now you

687
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,840
can go get a smartphone that's completely under your control you can

688
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:56,360
get the quote-unquote Google experience if you likes get that real pure

689
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:59,560
experience get something that's unlocked something you own outright and you're

690
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,380
paying like 23 bucks a month whoa man that's great so ting also has an ETF

691
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:09,320
relief program if you're stuck in a duopoly contract they have super great

692
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:13,920
customer service a fantastic dashboard to manage your ting account I mean it is

693
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,240
really the best in the industry and like I mentioned they got great sales going

694
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:24,080
right now so go to linux.ting.com to support the show and get $25 in credit

695
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,560
or $25 off a device if you want an internet phone they got the iPhone 5s

696
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:35,800
unlocked you own it outright 338 bucks right now nice really nice deal the s5

697
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:42,200
refurb edition 298 bucks that's a great Android phone for 298 bucks unlocked

698
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,320
yours yep you own that you own that s yeah with all the money you're gonna

699
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,800
save on ting I mean that's true buy one of these phones and not worry about it

700
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,960
the galaxy galaxy galaxy s6 this is a really nice phone with the octa core

701
00:51:53,960 --> 00:52:01,040
processor few gigs of RAM the PCIe storage the fantastic camera you can own

702
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:07,280
it outright completely unlocked no contract 597 bucks boom that's a really

703
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,480
good deal I think I think what I got mine is like 700 bucks so don't tell

704
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,800
people that's embarrassing but now where you guys got a great phone oh yeah that's

705
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,040
true that's a true story that's all that's another that's another tings

706
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:25,720
history right there there you go yeah it pays to be the editor doesn't it so go

707
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,840
to ting go get yourself a great bone go get yourself a plan because really

708
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,080
they've got you know they got stuff as low you can get a decent phone for as

709
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,640
low as a hundred bucks or actually if you want to get a feature phone much

710
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,840
lower than that and if you got a phone and you probably do because I got GSM

711
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:43,720
and CDMA networks so if you got a phone I encourage you to just go get a SIM card

712
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:48,520
because the SIM cards are really cheap nine bucks you pop a SIM card in this

713
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,960
one SIM card here if it's all your different devices it like yeah it's

714
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,400
really cool to do it and you just pop it out to the size you need they were

715
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,120
really were pretty clever when they designed this thing I'm thinking about

716
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,600
having ting be my backup network you know and totally certain other large

717
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,160
networks aren't working so well this is a great way to go like if you if you

718
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,520
have six dollars a month we kind of unofficially do it here at the studio

719
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,760
already so of course we don't use it as our primary internet here at the studio

720
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,320
but when the studio goes out well the first thing we do is we start tethering

721
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,040
from our team devices because it's just data like it doesn't affect the

722
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,040
contract I don't have to call up and get a shared program you know it's just turn

723
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,400
it on and I don't know for what yeah it is really really nice check it out

724
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:29,800
linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged

725
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:35,680
program linux.com is where you go to support this show okay let's talk about

726
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,080
the linux foundation this happened while I was on the road I didn't even know

727
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:46,220
this was going down but apparently this is another disgusting example of what

728
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:51,400
happens in the Linux community I'll start you off at the top so there's been

729
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:56,140
a controversy that's erupted around the Linux foundation it's it's it's whether

730
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:59,840
the Linux foundation essentially is serving open source community or

731
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:04,960
corporate sponsors that's essentially the takeaway headline but the Linux

732
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,840
foundation the nonprofit organization that supports Linux and increasingly

733
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,320
other open-source projects like I'm a big fan of the fact that they have the

734
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,880
the core infrastructure initiative which funds a lot of really important

735
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:23,680
open-source they tend to not really have any controversies but I really hate

736
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,120
this Michael Garrett a security developer at

737
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:30,840
CoreOS former Red Hat employee etc etc you probably for the name before

738
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,360
recently spotted that the Linux foundation has changed its bylaws to no

739
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,040
longer permit individual foundation members to elect members of the group's

740
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:42,840
board of directors Garrett wrote the majority of its board is chosen by

741
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:47,120
member companies ten by platinum members platinum membership costs five hundred

742
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:52,840
thousand a year three by gold members gold membership cost a hundred thousand

743
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:57,520
dollars a year and by one silver member a silver membership is five thousand

744
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:02,680
dollars and a twenty thousand dollar a year depending on your company size up

745
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:07,720
until recently individual members which I am loved one for $99 a year could also

746
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,840
elect two board members allowing a community perspective to be represented

747
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,840
at the board level which is one of the reasons I became a Linux Foundation

748
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:21,160
member get your voice hurt mm-hmm so this is an article at ZDNet written up

749
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:24,760
by Steven and he says why would the Linux Foundation do this carrot

750
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:30,720
speculates it's because of Karen Sandler the executive directory director of the

751
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,800
software freedom conservancy a woman who we have interviewed many times on our

752
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,840
shows an organization that does vitally important work of the enforcement of the

753
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,720
GPL I recently shared with you the story about their fight to enforce GPL

754
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:50,520
violations of VMware VMware who is a Linux Foundation member so Garrett

755
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,360
speculates that the individual membership program was quietly renamed

756
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,640
to the individual supporter program and the promised benefit of being allowed to

757
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,400
stand for and participate in board elections was dropped he compares the

758
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,920
old page and gives you a link to the new page he asked why would the Linux

759
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:10,400
Foundation do this well he states that historically it's been less than

760
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,760
enthusiastic about GPL enforcement and the software freedom conservancy is

761
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,440
funding a lawsuit against one of the foundation's members for violating terms

762
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:23,360
of the GPL he speculates they have made this move to prevent Karen Sandler from

763
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:36,240
joining the board then because of this speculation Karen Sandler has found

764
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:42,800
herself under attack by people who have assumed that her mission is to bring

765
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:47,440
some sort of agenda to the Linux Foundation a one that they would define

766
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:54,240
as a social justice warriors agenda and so she has now come under attack because

767
00:56:54,240 --> 00:57:00,280
of Garrett's speculation here the Linux Foundation didn't help the situation

768
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:07,400
it's not really their fault but Jim Zimmerman or Zimmerman Zemlin Zemlin

769
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:11,800
yeah who I've met and talked to before he's a nice guy was apparently busy

770
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,000
while all this shit was happening and everybody was declaring that the Linux

771
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,160
Foundation had betrayed the community and that this was an effort to switch

772
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:25,680
to corporate backing and that this was also an effort to block Karen Sandler

773
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:31,300
some even speculated a move by Linus Torvalds himself orchestrated by Linus

774
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:36,120
himself some of the crap that's out there is unbelievable and it turns out

775
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:39,880
of course that the guy that runs Linux Foundation was busy in China they

776
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,360
couldn't they couldn't get out because they were in China with limited access

777
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:48,000
to email as a result they only became aware of the problem 48 hours after it

778
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,720
blew up on social media and then they tried to make an immediate response on

779
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,520
their blog which completely sucked and was insufficient sorry Jim but it's true

780
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,280
the conversations relating to the Linux Foundation governance changes have

781
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,280
developed into personal inappropriate and offensive remarks he writes directed at

782
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,400
some members of the community in particular against Karen Sandler the

783
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:10,520
executive director of the software Freedom Conservancy but if you if you

784
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:15,960
extract yourself from all of that crap I think the real question behind the

785
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,880
debate is who actually is controlling the Linux Foundation is it the users or

786
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,000
is the companies now the current developers themselves are able to

787
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,120
direct some members to elect some members of the board like the technical

788
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:30,160
steering committee but Michael Garrett or Matthew Garrett sorry sees it as a

789
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,560
move as the Linux Foundation is taking one more step away from the community

790
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:37,960
and towards the corporate world it's not exactly addressed either that point is

791
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,680
not addressed in the Linux Foundation's post that's why I say it's in I say it's

792
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:45,440
insufficient but he does tell me say that the process for recruiting

793
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,400
community director should be changed to be in line with other leading

794
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,120
organizations in our community and our industry in other words nobody else does

795
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:55,400
it this way so in addition Garrett pointed out individuals are no longer

796
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,480
have the ability to run for and vote for the Linux Foundation board seat and

797
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,960
influence the direction of the foundation which I think is a bit of a

798
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:07,000
loss mm-hmm that said a lot of times what happens is these board positions

799
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,640
are clown shows they're people who are sort of positioned there by a corporate

800
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:15,720
interest they're people who are want to be pushed in position there because it's

801
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:20,400
better for their career to have it on their resume they are not always always

802
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,120
fully representative of who you actually want and a lot of times it's really the

803
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,320
companies that have different people in those positions line them up so that way

804
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:31,720
they can influence things and even when it's not the case like in the case of HP

805
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:36,560
it's often accused to be the case it's claimed to be the case so it often looks

806
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:42,680
bad anyways it is it to me I coming back from my trip I look at this and I go

807
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:48,320
this looks like a hot mess and I find myself to be sort of like taken aback by

808
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:52,960
all that wimpy I'm curious what your reaction is I see you had some thoughts

809
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:58,280
you know I'm wimpy hmm what do we are we in the wrong oh sorry with the go-ahead

810
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:04,420
so we're in the wrong room wimpy are you there do we lose you I think he's so

811
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:08,280
upset he left West well we should take a moment and have a beer we should take a

812
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,720
moment and have I do think he makes a good point though that you know we have

813
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:16,280
to consider the nature of Linux you know it's an open source thing it exists on

814
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,760
its own the Linux Foundation has always been you know like he's has a trade

815
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,560
association it's kind of a nice mechanism to extract money from people

816
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:27,320
who use Linux for their profits and then gear that you know they use it for open

817
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:32,600
you know the infrastructure but it has not it is not and as as Greg cage talks

818
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,920
in the our Linux link yeah you know if the community members haven't

819
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:40,840
necessarily besides be Dale then good representations of the community yes

820
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,120
they haven't really functioned this way so maybe a name oh I really like so

821
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:48,680
Greg cage took to the Linux subreddit and responded to some comments and I

822
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,240
really we're gonna link to that in the show notes because I really liked his

823
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,840
his take on it I don't can we not hear anybody in the number of somebody said

824
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,960
North Ranger say something for me can you do you say yeah do you see him

825
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:01,720
lighting up yep well I don't know what's going on computers are hard West I don't

826
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:05,600
know what's going on we're not experts here no no hi I don't I don't understand

827
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,240
the computers work and as far as I'm concerned we should all go back to

828
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:13,640
calculators I don't maybe close that thing and reopen it for me Wes I have no

829
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:19,600
idea I have no idea I I look at this and I I I'm trying I'm trying to suss out if

830
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,840
there is bad blood between the Linux Foundation and the software freedom

831
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:26,680
conservancy that's really my question right is there something going on there

832
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:35,560
is the Linux Foundation affected by its members I might oh I would tell you I

833
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:38,360
would like to sit here and tell you because I have a lot of respect for the

834
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:41,820
Linux Foundation I've worked with them on some projects in the past several

835
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:46,320
projects I do a lot of good things for the ecosystem yeah yeah like they pay

836
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:50,480
Greg and Linus that's a great right and the core infrastructure all kinds of

837
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:58,160
stuff they I also I also have seen sort of a side of the Linux Foundation that

838
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:01,960
gives me pause because it doesn't seem genuine it doesn't seem honest and that

839
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:06,900
is there are news outlets online they purport to be just straight news outlets

840
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:14,360
that are actually PR fronts press releases for the members of the Linux

841
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:20,360
Foundation primarily Sousa and Red Hat but others as well that hire people that

842
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:24,360
are their PR people to write articles for them and then they publish them on

843
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:30,480
these quote-unquote news sites as like as an article that essentially implies

844
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,600
this is why you should use distro you know insert Red Hat or Sousa or whatever

845
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:38,520
instead of something else and it's they are essentially native advertising

846
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,560
pieces that the Linux Foundation is allowing their members they're

847
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:45,680
contributing members to publish through their publishing platforms and I find

848
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,160
that to be disingenuous and I also over the years have found it to actually be

849
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,880
shaping the tone of the conversation in the community and I find that to also be

850
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,680
discussing and disingenuous so I would like to say that I have absolute

851
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:59,840
respect for the Linux Foundation but if I'm being completely honest with you I

852
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:05,640
have seen some practices that seem disingenuous to me I it basically it

853
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,280
seems that if you write a big enough check the Linux Foundation you get

854
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,240
access to their publishing platform and do what they want you want and that

855
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:16,160
bothers me because as somebody who publishes like that that really bothers

856
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:21,760
me now maybe I have it wrong maybe I don't but I do wonder if this is a shift

857
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:26,160
more towards corporate funding corporate sponsoring corporate interest which is

858
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,720
honestly where Linux makes its bones right now and maybe this is a moment for

859
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:34,400
us as community members to consider you know just how we think of the Linux

860
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,480
Foundation in terms of the larger ecosystem and other organizations that

861
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,720
maybe can do similar roles the other thing the other thing I question and I

862
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,200
wish I knew more about it and I absolutely welcome Matthew Garrett to

863
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,200
come on the show if you want to tell us about it himself the Mumba room is open

864
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,480
when it's working what I don't understand exactly is why Matthew made

865
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:55,500
these speculations about the known found the Linux Foundation making these

866
01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:03,480
changes specifically to to try to screw Karen I know that there was some timing

867
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,520
of some talks canceled all that kind of stuff but when you talk to Karen there

868
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:09,280
doesn't seem to be any malice on her part I'm just wondering where that

869
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,200
speculation came from because it led to some weird stuff that happened and I'm

870
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,240
kind of curious why he did that and maybe if he knows something that we

871
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,160
don't know but it seems like he went to his blog and made some speculations that

872
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,120
ended up causing a shit ton of issues for the Linux Foundation who are

873
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,880
honestly doing something that any foundation would normally do I don't

874
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,760
know if it necessarily agree with it but and there is merit to him bringing up

875
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:34,360
that they did away with the seeds just kind of the other stuff that got glommed

876
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,920
on there that maybe took away from that exactly exactly like I think it's a good

877
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,920
thing to mention as a contributing member I wouldn't have known this

878
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,640
otherwise exactly that part totally valid we should have a conversation

879
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:50,160
about that the speculation where why they did it it feels off base because

880
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:54,800
it's nothing unusual for a foundation to do like this it by their own bylaws

881
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:59,600
they're allowed to make these changes like it's all internal yeah so I don't

882
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:04,720
know exactly it leaves me it leaves me taking a bit of a pause but the the full

883
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:09,280
write-up Stephen J Vaughn Hoff Nicholas did a great I just added the Hoff who

884
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:13,600
wasn't he wasn't at scale that's too bad yeah he's like pretty much one of the

885
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:17,640
only Linux quote-unquote celebrities that wasn't at scale I don't know I mean

886
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:21,160
that's all right Noah was there showing him up so it doesn't matter he would

887
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:27,440
have to compete with Noah how can you right he doesn't bring the Google Glass

888
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,720
though really you know why you know why no here's something you'd never know

889
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:35,880
unless you're a glass hole if you change radical climates Google Glass gets

890
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:41,400
destroyed only because so the way that works is the projector that projects the

891
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:45,040
thing in your eyeball it projects against a foil reflection reflection

892
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:49,040
reflective material okay that's on the end of the prism that then bounces it

893
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:53,560
back into your eyeball when you travel and see where Noah's at it's like below

894
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,920
it's like negative 16 Fahrenheit right now so it's like crazy cold it's in

895
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:01,280
human cold it literally is no one should I live there no he should move and he

896
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,480
should come to join us and be end up but he's you know like the boiling frog he

897
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:10,480
doesn't know life any other way but what he has learned is when he travels to

898
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:15,440
places that have human climates like the West Coast yep I'm not boy people are

899
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,400
snowed in right now I'm we don't get any snow so I don't mean to make fun of you

900
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:24,200
but anyways he travels but if he makes large climate changes the foil that is

901
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:29,000
that the prism uses for projection reflection bubbles up and it destroys the

902
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,680
ability to project anything in Google Glass permanently yeah and so as he has

903
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,440
to get it replaced every time he does this and Google's been pretty good about

904
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:39,160
it but now they don't make glass anymore he feels like this might be his last

905
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:42,520
glass so now he can be now he's afraid to travel with it in the winter it's a

906
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:47,680
home glass it's home glass yep cuz it's too cold where he lives yeah he needs

907
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:52,680
like a humidor for it yeah yeah maybe maybe yeah now hold on now see a gates

908
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:56,040
earthquakes ain't got nothing to do with climate that's the two separate issues

909
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:59,440
yeah we're gonna have an earthquake that's why I drove highway 101 so I

910
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,920
could see the coast before it falls off into the ocean though I thought it'd be

911
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,400
beautiful I don't know what to do about a mobile room yeah I don't know what to

912
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,800
do about that Rekai what's going on what's going on I'm not sure what's

913
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,760
going on with that you closed and opened it right I sure did yeah I don't know

914
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,920
we're in the on air channel yeah we are we are you know what I'm gonna do I'll

915
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:17,600
reset the channel over on the mixer here we go you're ready for that let's see

916
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:22,400
here with you I think that we should all make those yeah okay yeah I just gotta

917
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:28,120
purge this buffer over here get it out of here okay there we go

918
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:38,840
okay wimpy can you can you say something now are you there hello yeah dearest

919
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:41,560
friends the mumble room that's all you got to do you guys can you just got a

920
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,480
reset the channel and flash a little bit so it was if there's anything you want

921
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:49,240
to mention on the foundation thing go ahead no I think where's covered it my

922
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:53,800
point was very brief and that's that the Linux Foundation is a trade is a trade

923
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:58,520
Association you pay to be a member of that trade Association and the Linux

924
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:05,280
Foundation represent the interests of its members and for the most part the

925
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:10,360
interests of its members are going to be conflicted with grassroots community

926
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:13,960
stuff hmm there's going to be some overlap you know you've mentioned core

927
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:18,760
infrastructure projects and all the rest of it that's terrific but being no doubt

928
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:24,920
that we're a we benefit as a byproduct of them surfing look we made you a nice

929
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:30,240
platform that works oh you guys can have it yeah yeah yeah I mean you know but

930
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:35,480
you know there yeah that's it trade Association there are lots of them in

931
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:39,680
different industries and that's how they work I would understand that they wanted

932
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,720
to remove you know instead of having two seats they wanted to limit it so they

933
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:47,680
could have they could open another seat to another you know another corporate

934
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:51,640
interest or something like that that makes sense but to completely remove the

935
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:57,040
community from the situation is just really weird it feels like it would made

936
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,200
them special to me it feels like what made them special is gone right I don't

937
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,680
think we'd question it if they'd never had one if that has nothing grown up but

938
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:05,680
the fact that they have had it and then just remove it even if it wasn't

939
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:09,680
necessarily doing its job it yeah it's hard to ignore to see the internet go

940
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:13,280
batshit crazy though and say that Linus is orchestrating some sort of campaign

941
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:16,880
against social justice warriors is sort of like I can't imagine he would care

942
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,600
for more than his colonel to even worry about that yeah it's a total misread of

943
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,880
what live in the priorities are yeah it shows what total lack of understanding

944
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,160
people have of how they have the how the community actually works it's sort of

945
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:33,380
ridiculous yeah we've got a community calling for our destruction here Chris

946
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:37,320
is that no what happened in this earthquake oh I know dude dude they're

947
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:40,600
gonna they're gonna totally they're gonna totally call call that cause it to

948
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,400
happen thanks guys thanks guys that's alright

949
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:48,960
then I'll just have to move over to to yeah man my I got I got I live on

950
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,600
springs and shocks I won't even notice but no actually that's not true you know

951
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,800
what I do notice Linux Academy because I noticed that they have made some major

952
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,440
improvements over at Linux Academy I'd like you to go there it's a learning

953
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,320
platform for Linux and all the technologies around it everything that

954
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:06,040
really kicks ass in the Linux ecosystem they've got stuff to help you learn and

955
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:11,200
manage it including like AWS platforms of course the Red Hat certified courses

956
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:15,280
step-by-step video courses so many of them downloadable comprehensive study

957
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,400
guides instructor help is available 7 plus distress for you to choose from

958
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:23,320
that's the highlights Linux Academy has really been rocking they just had a big

959
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,440
announcement recently they've rolled out a ton of new features but one I want to

960
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:30,560
talk about today which I think is super cool is the new Linux Academy mobile app

961
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,920
for iOS and Android this is a really really great idea if you get a couple of

962
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,560
minutes on your device I think this is gonna be the way to go you're gonna see

963
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:42,240
the Android version coming at the end of q1 2016 it's gonna be free for all the

964
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:45,560
users of course you're gonna need to be a member to take advantage of it but

965
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:48,920
look at that right there it gives you an idea of what it's like to become a

966
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,840
Linux Academy member you go in there you can create you can choose a topic they

967
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,440
go you go into Linux certification training you can go into OpenStack AWS

968
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:59,560
DevOps then once you go into those realms there is so much content to learn

969
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:05,720
there is scenario based labs there are great great exercises for you to take

970
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:09,240
there are nuggets to go deep dive into a single topic when you're ready in-depth

971
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:12,920
resources virtual machines that spin up with the courseware on demand that you

972
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:18,800
can SSH into brand new CDN to distribute all of that content and live streams of

973
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,520
a bunch of really really great sessions where you can ask the educators

974
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,920
questions directly it's amazing how helpful this is just if you want to be a

975
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:29,080
Linux professional in any way right like yeah maybe you've been doing it forever

976
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:32,480
and you want to catch up with what's this DevOps jazz you keep hearing about

977
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,560
one of the things there's two things in the Linux Academy we're really kind of

978
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:39,600
like game changers for me personally the first one was taking courseware and

979
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,160
breaking it down into hours you know learn Python in six hours no longer this

980
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:46,160
nebulous thing oh I need to spend six hours that I can actually understand

981
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:51,440
Python but the other thing is is I suck at taking tests like not my thing I hate

982
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,600
it like because I always feel like tests are like of these scenarios that never

983
01:11:54,600 --> 01:12:00,720
actually happen in the real world and so then I really just Google right so now

984
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:04,480
one of the things they have to help with test anxiety that I have is practice

985
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,680
exams nice yeah you can use Linux Academy practice exams to help prepare

986
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:12,200
your way through the like like maybe AWS or one of the red hats courses or

987
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,440
anything like that you can also take Linux Academy quizzes to help ensure

988
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,400
you're learning the core concepts required to be successful so not just

989
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:23,200
passing the test not just passing the test really understanding them yeah

990
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,880
that's really use it you know you've already deployed it once you've finished

991
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:29,800
with Linux Academy and as a listener of our program you go to Linux Academy on

992
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:33,560
Linux Academy comm slash unplugged you get a great discount that's cool thing

993
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:38,640
number one Linux Academy comm slash unplugged but because we've been talking

994
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,840
about Linux Academy for a while now lots of JB members in their community lots of

995
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,880
Jupiter colony members up in that community so you're hanging out with a

996
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:49,180
great group of friends that help give you that sort of confidence boost when

997
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:53,360
you need it or celebrate when you've got some breakthrough it's really cool

998
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,560
Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for

999
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,280
sponsoring the unplug program and congrats on the new app and all of the

1000
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:04,120
new updates you guys are kicking and Anthony was down at scale I didn't get

1001
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:06,880
chance to say hi to him but he was down at scale so you might have got a chance

1002
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:10,600
it really our community members I loves it yeah they're huge enthusiasts it's

1003
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:16,800
really cool so AMD has got something hot for us GPU open GP open is composed of

1004
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:24,000
two areas games and CGI for games graphics and content creation holy yeah

1005
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,080
they're the first to provide code they say and documentation allowing PC

1006
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:32,080
developers to exert more control over the GPU but that's the first part of it

1007
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,640
the second part of it is a commitment to open source software the game and

1008
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:38,840
graphics development community is an active hub of enthusiasts individuals

1009
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:42,280
who believe in the value of sharing knowledge full and flexible access to

1010
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:47,320
the source of tools libraries and effects is a key pillar of the GPU open

1011
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:51,000
philosophy so it's not just talking to the driver it's art assets it's all

1012
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,840
kinds of stuff documentation library is you need to take advantage of their

1013
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:58,920
sweet sweet hardware so this is being put on by AMD I understand is that your

1014
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:04,600
understanding as well yeah what every single year here's where I'm at with

1015
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:10,440
this I'm getting real sick and tired of this crap getting real bitter and I'm

1016
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:14,520
becoming a little skeptical every year I sit here and I'm reading you stories

1017
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:18,520
about how AMD is gonna revolutionize their open source graphics driver how

1018
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:22,020
they're gonna decouple this how they're gonna have user space that kernel space

1019
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:28,560
that how they're gonna have initiative this protocol that and every single year

1020
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,880
I feel like I'm just reading a different version of this story and this is the

1021
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:37,000
coolest version yet that gets me just as excited as ever at the end of the day

1022
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,720
what the hell is actually going on with what's going on here unfortunately I

1023
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:45,960
think we're still in the wait and see you know I'm glad they've launched this

1024
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:51,680
website they've had code up on github for a little while but so you know we're

1025
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:55,680
still waiting for Vulcan we're still waiting for the I'm just all of the AMD

1026
01:14:55,680 --> 01:15:01,280
GPU stuff I am Colonel and be deployed by distributions I know I piss off all

1027
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:05,660
the AMD fans when I say this but I'm just not impressed I I love all of the

1028
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:09,600
things they're saying and every time they say them I love them every single

1029
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:15,160
time and then I just I don't I guess what it feels like to me right now is

1030
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:19,800
before the last idea ever even sees code they got a whole new idea that's even

1031
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:23,440
better than the last idea that this right we had mantle and now well now

1032
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,960
it's there for supporting Vulcan which is good but it's still like and I feel

1033
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,800
like for three years I've been hearing about how they're gonna split the

1034
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,820
graphics drivers up and it's gonna be super awesome and you can just use the

1035
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:33,760
open source driver and if you want a few more features you go get this binary

1036
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,680
blob in user space and you're good to go to be fair they never actually claimed

1037
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,840
that mantle is coming to the Linux they even were asked specifically and they

1038
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:44,800
just basically dismissed it saying that if people wanted it then maybe they'd

1039
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,840
consider it but now they're actually saying that the since they're doing open

1040
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:52,640
source is actually gonna be coming and I think it's great you know that like

1041
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:58,000
what they're saying is great and I'm optimistic but you know it's been ten

1042
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,920
years since they were reasonably usable in Linux so at this point I was still

1043
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,880
not gonna buy their stuff yeah it's hard to come back from underperforming to

1044
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:09,280
such a level here's why it's a double burn for me and this is really obsessed

1045
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:12,280
me so not only are they saying crap that I like and want and they're not

1046
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:15,440
delivering as far as I can estimate and these any material way that actually

1047
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:19,160
matters at all but at the same time it's like hey everybody and this is something

1048
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:22,200
the Windows users that's like the savvy ones are starting to give Linux users a

1049
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:26,600
hard time about hey come to the Linux desktop the land of free and open source

1050
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,720
choice where you have all the great choices in the world oh except for your

1051
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,600
graphics card if you want any performance at all use Nvidia replace

1052
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:38,600
most of your weird X stack with so like we have one video card manufacturer that

1053
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:42,620
makes I mean like really where where's the choice you can use Intel and have a

1054
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:49,040
subpar experience you can use Nvidia or you can use AMD and in my testing the

1055
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:54,520
Nvidia is by far and and and and really the only easy one-click solution by most

1056
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:58,760
distros for end-users to implement and get great graphics performance yeah we

1057
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,640
have one choice if you're a regular end-user in Linux land and it's Nvidia

1058
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:04,940
there's there's no come to the land of multiple choice except for why here you

1059
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:09,520
only have one choice and and and AMD is done nothing in all this time nothing to

1060
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:13,680
change the situation a lot of good talk I get all hot and bothered they kind of

1061
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,680
just have followed Nvidia's track but not done it as well

1062
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:22,080
wimpy what do you think you think the iris graphics is is finally there you

1063
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:27,960
think we're finally finally there with the 6100 I'm not the biggest gamer but I

1064
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:35,680
have embraced steam in the last few months and my nut with iris 6100 plays

1065
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:40,720
all the games I have and I've got I think I don't know if I have a 6100

1066
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:45,800
machine I don't know if I have one and I haven't tried that one but I'm not just

1067
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:51,720
running the games but running the games at quad HD so just to be clear this is

1068
01:17:51,720 --> 01:18:01,120
not 4k quad HD is 1440p that's nice it's not William I'm curious to see what you

1069
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:05,560
think about this so I think AMD has been in the state where they just have to

1070
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:10,000
announce paper launches for things yeah like we have this great idea here it is

1071
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,640
but they're not gonna have that thing materialized for years like oh we've

1072
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,240
made an initial commit and we have a plan here's this thing we're launching

1073
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:18,320
but it's not gonna launch for a couple of years and see until we get down the

1074
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,040
road until we have hardware support until we have all these things until

1075
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:24,200
we've actually written the software like don't don't abandon us don't abandon us

1076
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,880
right they don't want you to abandon them because they're kind of falling

1077
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:29,640
behind and they're trying to show all these paper releases that just aren't

1078
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:33,880
there yet so we're in I hope we get there and I think we will get there

1079
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:37,600
eventually so is the way to take time so do you think the way to look at GPU open

1080
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:43,400
is more about it's a piece to the overall strategy so an open source

1081
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:48,360
driver is a piece to that but also piece of that is giving developers open

1082
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:53,120
resources to take advantage of to make great games like it's it's part of the

1083
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,480
overall strategy but it's just part of it and we're just waiting around that

1084
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,320
really that's really what's going on here isn't it I mean it's even like the

1085
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:02,160
splitting of the GPU driver it's part of the strategy they're gonna try and make

1086
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:05,640
all the kernel space stuff open and integrated into the mainline kernel and

1087
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,000
then have a bunch of user space components that they can change out

1088
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,920
depending on whether you want proprietary features or not right I'm

1089
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,560
so nice and they're just we're slowly getting there like they just started

1090
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:16,520
committing this I want to say like five kernel versions back you know we're

1091
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,120
finally getting to somewhere where it's usable yeah they have at least dumped

1092
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,320
some code into the kernel which is but they announced it way back when yeah

1093
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:27,400
that's where that's where I'm kind of like oh come on already but I like the

1094
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:31,480
idea of open source resources graphic assets all that kind of stuff for

1095
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,080
developers that's really cool we'll see if they can get their foot in the door

1096
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:38,040
with like scientific stuff if open CL can really compete with yeah you know

1097
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:41,320
yeah video stuff there yeah and they're also distracted with all their side

1098
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,880
projects like they're building the a1100 arm chips and they got to get sent out

1099
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:48,320
the door and they got to get the new GPU architecture done like they've got all

1100
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:52,960
these things yeah that was a huge paper release like they talked about this

1101
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:56,640
three years ago as being ready in a year and it still isn't even shipping like

1102
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:01,720
we're just getting there now hopefully so we'll see you know I've talked about

1103
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:07,860
this before but you look at the next three years for Linux mm-hmm we have

1104
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:13,360
never had more change coming ever so you have you have obviously we've talked

1105
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:18,400
about today Wayland coming you have Vulcan coming right you have the

1106
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:23,040
continuation of evolution of system D and bus one or KD bus whatever it's

1107
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:27,600
gonna be that's coming and all of these transitions are gonna be some of the

1108
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:31,920
biggest transitions we have ever seen in the desktop ever like a lot of times we

1109
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:36,800
see things that are really huge on the cloud and server but this this is gonna

1110
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,400
be huge and wimpy there's another big one I didn't even mention coming isn't

1111
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:44,240
there yeah I was said if s is I think it's gonna really gain traction in in

1112
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:48,880
the Linux mm-hmm over the next yeah 12 months yeah 18 months well I'll be

1113
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:54,720
running ZFS on root machines with Wayland open-source AMD graphics it'll

1114
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:58,800
be a glorious future in system D container yeah right exactly and spawn

1115
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:04,880
man oh whatever you're drinking where's I want to find you know I'm gonna just

1116
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:08,400
end it right there that's a good way to wrap it up on the unplugged show it is

1117
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,040
gonna be a couple of crazy years and guess what we're gonna be talking about

1118
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:15,840
it they do every single annoying minutia along the way we'll be discussing right

1119
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,640
here on your talk show Linux unplugged we'd love to have you joins don't forget

1120
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:22,080
we do this show on Tuesdays go over to Jupiter broadcasting comms less calendar

1121
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:26,280
to get the live time jblive.tv is where you watch it Linux actually showed out

1122
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:30,120
reddit comms where you go to submit content and stories and you heard our

1123
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,000
virtual log you could participate in that you just need the mumble software

1124
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,680
open-source software go to our IRC room you can get the info on how to join us

1125
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:39,400
we'd love to have you here on the unplugged program if you can't make it

1126
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:42,400
the subreddit it's just great all right thanks for being here see you right back

1127
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:53,080
here next Tuesday

1128
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:30,600
so I kind of feel like I'm gonna get some crap for calling out the Linux

1129
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,640
Foundation on that on that news outlet thing but that is something that they do

1130
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:38,760
that really bothers me yeah because it feels really dishonest and it's

1131
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:42,080
basically you know you got to be of a certain you got to be of a certain

1132
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:45,800
contribution level it seems I can't go I can't exactly tell what it is and you

1133
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,840
have to have writing staff and if you meet those qualifications you get to

1134
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:54,400
publish through some fairly well well-established news outlets and then on

1135
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,360
top of that because they're because they're established enough all of this

1136
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,640
all of the new syndication sites pick up those stories and then it just becomes

1137
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,760
part of the discussion and it feels like they get background cred in the

1138
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,160
community because of the Linux Foundation name on the front right even

1139
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:10,840
if the company play maybe uses it for their end but doesn't isn't a good

1140
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:14,280
community player it's not something I've brought up before a lot because I feel

1141
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:17,880
like I'm good there's gonna be a certain amount of backlash because I value my

1142
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:21,200
relationship with the Linux Foundation because I think in other words they in

1143
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,880
other you know other realms they do a lot of good and I've worked with them in

1144
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:29,240
several projects before and they've been fruitful and I enjoyed that and and also

1145
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:32,760
you know I like to be able to speak to the people that they pay they write the

1146
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:36,760
paychecks to but at the end of the day like that is a concern of mine that I

1147
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:40,240
have so it's a real tight line for me to walk there but I kind of feel like I

1148
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:43,520
have to say it's something that bothers me and it doesn't mean that they're bad

1149
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,840
as a whole it just means this is an aspect that happens that I don't quite

1150
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:51,000
understand maybe I'm wrong about but to me I would like to know more information

1151
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,920
about it and it doesn't it doesn't preclude the fact that they also

1152
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,920
contribute to open source projects when they can that they contribute to people

1153
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,560
that are making incredible changes in the Linux kernel that doesn't doesn't

1154
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:05,440
it doesn't take away from any of that so I hope I don't get too much crap for it

1155
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:09,680
but I'm probably gonna get some crap well you always get crap that's just

1156
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:14,160
have you been to the internet before I don't know but yeah yeah that's all it's

1157
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:17,920
true that's true I do that it's good boy I'm trying to think of like what's the

1158
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,000
worst-case slack scenario because it because I'm starting to slide West I'm

1159
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,080
sliding into slack and it's I mean I've had a great I love that they have it

1160
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:27,840
even if it's just chromium they have the Linux dev files that I've enjoyed that

1161
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,040
yeah I think it's sub clutter I can't remember what the name of it is that I'm

1162
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:35,040
using on the Linux desktop for a dedicated slide okay and you know their

1163
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:40,040
iOS client is great Android no complaints yeah really either but I mean

1164
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:43,560
even we have a couple channels just for like individual projects and on some of

1165
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:47,280
them we've gone past 10,000 messages yeah and then the archive starts to go

1166
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:50,920
away and it's like you start depending especially on things like where you're

1167
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:54,180
sharing information you're like oh well just just pass there I know the some

1168
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:57,560
information I wanted did I put it in this channel for use and so we are hey

1169
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:00,360
we've asked if like you know we're trying to see if not yet so we haven't

1170
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:04,840
been we're seeing about pain and so serious so that I saw like there was a

1171
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:08,640
recent thread did you get on reddit about matter most yeah yeah I have not

1172
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:13,940
actually tried it I know I should huh the thing is I guess the thing that

1173
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:20,080
matter most isn't gonna deliver for me right now at least is it takes 30

1174
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:24,320
seconds almost to set up a new slack like yeah it's super easy great and if

1175
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:28,480
I'm hosting it myself I just I don't really have time for this right now I

1176
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:33,000
just need problems solved I don't want to create more problems down the road

1177
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,120
but here's what I'm truly truly worried about and I don't know exactly where you

1178
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:41,040
go to find it I'm trying to figure out yeah like if so here's an example like

1179
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:47,600
if I want to upgrade to standard edition $880 per year is what it would cost

1180
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,760
Jupiter broadcasting right now and that's just because we only we only have

1181
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:55,000
11 users in our slack I think for us it was somewhere in the couple grand rate

1182
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:59,880
yeah or eight per user per month that's a little more swallow me sending

1183
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:04,120
invoices out to crew members so then it goes back to well okay it's kind of

1184
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:07,680
worth looking at matter most but it is it has become a critical tool and the

1185
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:12,600
thing the other does it well and the other problem is a lot of people now

1186
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:16,160
have slack accounts yep so you can it's already have the client on their phone

1187
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:19,520
yeah yeah they already know how to use it too and some people are already kind

1188
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:24,240
of like slack clever and they like yeah so I like that one of them I don't

1189
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,880
remember it was better most or rocket chat I think had better markdown support

1190
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:30,760
slack has like partial but yeah markdown support would be kill Lark cuz then we

1191
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:34,560
could actually cut and paste stuff right into show notes yeah yeah somebody should

1192
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:37,680
set up a matter most for us and let us try it out maybe we need like a matter

1193
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:42,680
most slack bridge well I would I would be I would also like to know people know

1194
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:48,680
of a hosted matter most solution yeah yeah because I just don't I just am not

1195
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:51,360
in a position to manage more stuff I like if I have free time right now I

1196
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:54,200
want to spend it on other projects right now I don't want to spend my time on

1197
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:59,480
that so I would really like to get a recommendation I wonder if there's also

1198
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:05,760
just for me like maybe I can just set up the IRC bridge and then have a IRC

1199
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:10,160
program that saves all my history archives it that way keep up the keep

1200
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:15,160
the free moon yeah I assume that so when I think of hosting matter most right my

1201
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:19,120
my mind immediately goes to well I'm gonna spin up a digital ocean droplet

1202
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:22,680
right and I'm gonna register a domain and I'm gonna create user accounts and

1203
01:27:22,680 --> 01:27:26,160
then I'm gonna convince all of the JB people to switch over from slack to this

1204
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:30,440
new system and we're gonna have to do a cream a clean break of our history and

1205
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:34,960
then when we fill up space or we want more users or whatever it's always gonna

1206
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:39,200
be on me to do it and just right I'm not digging that idea that's a big workload

1207
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,960
and you're not gonna want to troubleshoot it when you're right before

1208
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:45,240
show then again I don't feel like spending a grand a year for essentially

1209
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:50,220
fancy IRC right when you have the technical capability yeah not maybe the
