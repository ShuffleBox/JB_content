This is Linux Unplugged Episode 7 for September 24th, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.280
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, the weekly Linux podcast that keeps checking

00:40.280 --> 00:45.360
the source of the Steam countdown page, hoping for hidden messages from Gabe. My name is

00:45.360 --> 00:50.880
Chris. My name is Matt. Hey there, Matt. Welcome to Episode 7, buddy. Thanks. Fresh off of

00:50.880 --> 00:54.400
the birthday weekend, too. Nice, man. Oh, I know. It's been great. It's just been one

00:54.400 --> 00:58.920
big whirlwind of acting like a complete nutjob. It's been awesome. You know what? I'm acting

00:58.920 --> 01:03.760
like a nutjob tonight. I'm going carb crazy. Right on. I'm going to gluten it up, man.

01:03.760 --> 01:08.280
So right now, I'm drinking a gluten-free hard apple cider. I got to keep the gluten down

01:08.280 --> 01:13.240
because tonight we're going with a pasta with an Alfredo sauce. If I'm rekt for tomorrow's

01:13.240 --> 01:16.600
on filter, you know why. I got crazy. And I got to hook you up with some of the gluten-free

01:16.600 --> 01:21.800
recipes we got. My wife's got this entire monster cookbook for people that really like

01:21.800 --> 01:26.280
to eat. Okay, good. It's none of the sissy stuff. It's like food. We'll have to share.

01:26.280 --> 01:31.160
We'll trade notes. Yeah, totally. Now, you know, coming up on this week's episode, we're

01:31.160 --> 01:36.920
going to, of course, be talking about SteamOS, which was just announced by Valve yesterday.

01:36.920 --> 01:40.640
We're in the calm between the storms. Tomorrow, another announcement comes. We'll be doing

01:40.640 --> 01:45.360
some speculation on what those announcements could be. But today, I thought we'd kind of

01:45.360 --> 01:48.640
take a snapshot of where we're at with the announcement of SteamOS. We'll do a little

01:48.640 --> 01:51.680
speculation, but really, we're going to talk about what this could mean for Linux. We're

01:51.680 --> 01:55.800
going to talk about what this means for gaming and really what this means for an open platform

01:55.800 --> 01:58.120
in general. I think we're going to have a great episode. Plus, we're going to bring

01:58.120 --> 02:02.640
in our mumble guys who are always thinking about this stuff, always debating, a good

02:02.640 --> 02:06.760
round table in there. Great opinions and whatnot. I think it's going to be a really fun episode,

02:06.760 --> 02:11.480
Matt. I know it is. And plus, then after this, I'm going to go gluten crazy. Now, you know.

02:11.480 --> 02:16.600
All right. Well, so why don't we start with a little follow-up, as is per tradition, before

02:16.600 --> 02:22.360
we get into the main show. I wanted to read an email that came in from Jacob. Now, Jacob

02:22.360 --> 02:28.720
was referring to last week. We got kind of on the whole Android discussion and we called

02:28.720 --> 02:32.840
it the Android problem, if you recall, Matt. I remember. Well, Jacob thought it was an

02:32.840 --> 02:37.040
amazingly eye-opening episode and another way to look at Google. He says, one thing

02:37.040 --> 02:42.000
to note, on iOS 7 Google Chrome now, he says, maybe this has already been implemented on

02:42.000 --> 02:46.200
Android, there is a feature they ask if you want to turn on, which sends all of your internet

02:46.200 --> 02:51.140
traffic to some Google services for them to then compress it and send along to your phone.

02:51.140 --> 02:55.400
In light of recent events, i.e. Snowden, it would seem that they aren't just compressing

02:55.400 --> 02:58.400
all that data. Just something to think about. Great show, by the way. I just subscribed

02:58.400 --> 03:03.360
to the All Shows feed. Constantly refreshing, waiting for the next show to come out. So

03:03.360 --> 03:06.320
yeah, I'm of a mixed opinion. So I talked about this a little bit yesterday on Code

03:06.320 --> 03:09.140
Radio, Matt, but here's kind of where I'm at. I think you're going to appreciate the

03:09.140 --> 03:15.260
zen-ness of my sort of final position here. So one of the things that kind of got me all

03:15.260 --> 03:20.560
riled up was lack of updates, right? Google's bad original deals that sort of torpedoed

03:20.560 --> 03:26.520
the future update possibilities of a platform, and you know, the way that some of the carriers

03:26.520 --> 03:32.480
can go crazy. But thankfully, there's alternative carriers now that kind of solve some of that

03:32.480 --> 03:35.680
problem. Where I'm at with Google now, it's like, I just kind of like treat Google like

03:35.680 --> 03:40.040
I treat my Twitter stream. Not my out replies, but just the front page of Twitter. Like,

03:40.040 --> 03:43.600
I just jump in, I just see what people are talking about, and then I jump out. I'm not

03:43.600 --> 03:46.680
one of those people that needs to read the whole Twitter feed, right? Yeah, I'm kind

03:46.680 --> 03:52.240
of the same way. I mean, like with Twitter, I literally use it as my email forward. I

03:52.240 --> 03:58.060
pay very little attention about what's going on there. But I really do. I mean, I pay some

03:58.060 --> 04:01.880
attention to Facebook, I pay most of my attention to Google+, Twitter, not so much. Which is

04:01.880 --> 04:07.940
ironic being it's Google. I try to read all my replies on Twitter. Yeah, I generally do.

04:07.940 --> 04:11.320
Direct messages, I don't pay any attention. Well, they're harder to find these days. So

04:11.320 --> 04:16.520
that's how I'm going to treat Android. When an Android release comes out, and if it meets

04:16.520 --> 04:21.520
the conditions of a platform that I want, I'll make a precision strike. I'll grab that

04:21.520 --> 04:25.980
device, going in knowing that, hey, maybe I'm going to have update issues. Hey, maybe

04:25.980 --> 04:30.080
this is going to have stuff bundled along with it. And if I want to fix that, I have

04:30.080 --> 04:36.120
to take certain steps myself. I feel like doing that sort of is like this. It's an acknowledgement

04:36.120 --> 04:39.200
of the limitations, and then just kind of deciding, all right, well, it still has enough

04:39.200 --> 04:42.560
incentives that I'm going to go ahead and go forward with it. That's where I'm at.

04:42.560 --> 04:48.240
For me, it's very app specific. When it comes to data, I'm naively ambivalent about the

04:48.240 --> 04:53.680
whole thing. I tend to just live with my head in the clouds and figure, you know, if they're

04:53.680 --> 04:56.480
going to want to know something badly about me, they're going to figure something out.

04:56.480 --> 05:00.120
So I just don't get too excited about it. I mean, it irritates me, but I try not to

05:00.120 --> 05:06.860
focus on it too much because it just depresses me. So I mean, quite honestly, I am conscientious

05:06.860 --> 05:10.600
about what I'm searching for or what I'm doing on my phone. Definitely so. Even the apps

05:10.600 --> 05:14.440
I install, I'm very conscientious about it. But I would say for the most part, I'm pretty

05:14.440 --> 05:18.560
ambivalent about it. I don't think too much about it, although I am having an app specific

05:18.560 --> 05:23.240
problem that perhaps we'll talk about at the end of the show. But outside of that, no,

05:23.240 --> 05:26.360
I'm okay with it. I still like it better than iPhone.

05:26.360 --> 05:30.000
Let's get to the app thing because I watched something happen over the weekend on the Play

05:30.000 --> 05:34.360
Store that I was pretty disappointed in that I think is real low class of Google and Google

05:34.360 --> 05:37.920
Play. So we'll talk about it at the end of the show if we have time. One more piece of

05:37.920 --> 05:44.320
follow up to yesterday, or I'm sorry, Sunday's Linux action show. Blackout Worm on YouTube

05:44.320 --> 05:47.400
was responding to, remember we had the email where the guy was like, gosh, I could switch

05:47.400 --> 05:51.640
to Linux. It's just that I really need iTunes. And we were like, what does anybody quote

05:51.640 --> 05:56.920
unquote need iTunes for? Well, see, and I had to ask my wife because I haven't a clue.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.680
She's the iTunes diva in this house. So I had to ask her. I was like, well, can't you

05:59.680 --> 06:03.080
do this over Wi-Fi? And she says, well, I think you could do something over iCloud.

06:03.080 --> 06:06.680
But she says, I honestly just connected to my, she just does the USB thing. Yeah, that's

06:06.680 --> 06:10.520
what my wife does too. And she just, she said, she told me, well, it works. Why would I change

06:10.520 --> 06:13.120
it? So that's what I thought the reason was. And I was like, okay, they just don't know

06:13.120 --> 06:17.080
about iCloud and the fact that iTunes thinking is probably going to go well. Well, Blackout

06:17.080 --> 06:20.720
Worm wrote and he said, the only reason I would need iTunes on Linux is for streaming

06:20.720 --> 06:24.760
TV shows. And this is, he echoed a point that we heard from a few folks who said, I bought

06:24.760 --> 06:28.160
into the, you know, I'm a cord cutter and I bought into the buy and breaking bad or

06:28.160 --> 06:33.940
whatever on iTunes. He says, Netflix and Amazon's library is peanuts compared to iTunes. iTunes

06:33.940 --> 06:38.560
has a lot of exclusives, meaning shows that aren't and will probably never be released

06:38.560 --> 06:43.360
on DVD or Blu-ray. As a Linux user, I really hate that there's little to no DRM support

06:43.360 --> 06:48.160
here. Can't get it working, nor MP4s that I bought from my iPad. I really wish that

06:48.160 --> 06:55.920
would change. As far as digital media goes, Linux is 10 years behind. Uh, no. It's just

06:55.920 --> 06:59.860
they're not included in these closed systems. Yeah, I, yeah, I wouldn't even go, but the

06:59.860 --> 07:02.840
whole 10 years behind thing, it's like, it really just depends on how you go about getting

07:02.840 --> 07:05.600
your media. Well, and whose rules are you playing by? Are you playing, are you playing

07:05.600 --> 07:10.600
by Apple's rules? Well then yeah, but of course they made that only work in iTunes. This is,

07:10.600 --> 07:16.520
this is almost where I almost can see, ah, I hate going down this route, but, but you

07:16.520 --> 07:23.720
know, I talk about sometimes, sometimes to me piracy, the piracy of content like TV shows

07:23.720 --> 07:27.680
to me can, it almost feels like an act of civil disobedience in some sense because,

07:27.680 --> 07:31.440
uh, yeah, it does in a lot of ways because artificial limitations that prevent you from

07:31.440 --> 07:35.440
getting it because it's not actually affecting supply and demand. It's not actually affecting

07:35.440 --> 07:39.960
a warehouse of goods. It's not, you know, it's not tangible. Um, you know, there's not

07:39.960 --> 07:42.800
a tangible thing people can point you. So yeah, a lot of people, you know, so that,

07:42.800 --> 07:46.760
that argument is, I think it's valid and the unfortunate part is about it is like when

07:46.760 --> 07:52.240
you, when you pirate, you eliminate this DRM issue, the blackout worm, right? You eliminate

07:52.240 --> 07:56.040
this incompatibility. Like you just throw it on a Plex server and then you have it on

07:56.040 --> 08:01.560
every device everywhere at any time and the whole, all the problems are solved. And there's

08:01.560 --> 08:07.240
like, there's this whole, and oftentimes it's higher resolution too, which is, you know,

08:07.240 --> 08:12.240
a whole nother aspect to it. And so it's like, there's all these incentives and these deer,

08:12.240 --> 08:17.640
all these walled off systems with DRM really to me just don't speak my language. They don't

08:17.640 --> 08:19.640
speak a longterm solution to me.

08:19.640 --> 08:23.740
Well, they're not very effective. Absolutely not. I don't think they're effective at all.

08:23.740 --> 08:28.840
And I think that it really, it speaks to something when you can find that a pirating ecosystem

08:28.840 --> 08:34.120
is actually more pleasant and usable than the official ecosystems that are authorized.

08:34.120 --> 08:38.920
And I feel like as technology has changed so rapidly in the last five years, content

08:38.920 --> 08:44.680
that like for example, blackout worm has purchased content that he bought on iTunes doesn't scale

08:44.680 --> 08:49.080
to his evolving needs in a, in a changing technology platform environment. However,

08:49.080 --> 08:52.680
content that he might've pirated, that's portable. That's, that's free. That's, you know, it's

08:52.680 --> 08:55.400
going to move around however you want. It's just, it's, it's so dumb the way the system

08:55.400 --> 08:56.400
works.

08:56.400 --> 08:59.800
It is. And I also want to point out that Angelo was kind enough to point out that, yes, you

08:59.800 --> 09:05.560
can actually sync over wifi. So his problem of needing that USB connection is really not

09:05.560 --> 09:09.840
needed. You know, so Angelo, yeah, I understand. That's good to know. That's good. And so,

09:09.840 --> 09:13.880
but I also understand that you know, pirating is not really a great option and it's not

09:13.880 --> 09:15.680
necessarily an option that a lot of people want to do.

09:15.680 --> 09:19.920
Well, and a lot of people can take more of a, I don't know, a looser, I've been known

09:19.920 --> 09:24.000
to buy, we have what we call mom flicks and that's my mother-in-law who has approximately

09:24.000 --> 09:29.620
15,000 DVDs and I'm probably low balling that. Um, any DVD, you know, so anything I want

09:29.620 --> 09:33.680
I can rip. You know what I mean? It's like, it's a problem solved for me. So, you know,

09:33.680 --> 09:37.320
it works out pretty well from that. So I have that option as well. And if it's not available

09:37.320 --> 09:42.080
to me, then I probably don't need it that badly. You know?

09:42.080 --> 09:43.080
I agree, Matt.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.080
That was perfect.

09:44.080 --> 09:49.660
I really, I really think also we just kind of need to put our big boy pants on and be

09:49.660 --> 09:53.440
like, fine, you don't want to sell me your content. I'm not going to buy it. I mean,

09:53.440 --> 09:56.880
we're willing to make that stance for open sourcing versus closed software. You know,

09:56.880 --> 10:00.000
Photoshop, you don't want to make your software available for my platform. I'm not going to

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
buy it.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.320
I was able to do that with everything except Dexter and Breaking Bad. I just, I had to

10:04.320 --> 10:05.320
have that.

10:05.320 --> 10:11.440
That's fair. That's fair. I guess, you know, there is always that sort of a cultural, um,

10:11.440 --> 10:16.440
experience, right? Like I, I am a Star Trek, you know, there's, it doesn't matter. I would,

10:16.440 --> 10:20.720
I would, there are hoops I would jump through and have jumped through for Star Trek. I mean,

10:20.720 --> 10:24.840
I have bought all that crap on Blu-ray or, or convinced family members to get it for

10:24.840 --> 10:25.840
me for the holidays.

10:25.840 --> 10:29.520
Exactly. That's where it's at. Yep. It's, that's where it's at. Like get me Star Trek.

10:29.520 --> 10:30.520
You could do no wrong.

10:30.520 --> 10:35.760
Well, and to be honest with you, uh, this is again, another advantage to physical media

10:35.760 --> 10:40.040
in the sense that it's easily backupable, breakable. Um, and then I throw it into an

10:40.040 --> 10:46.640
MKV file and I'm, and I'm good to go. I encode it with x264 and it sits on my, on my server.

10:46.640 --> 10:50.760
Um, and it also is a higher resolution because it's from Blu-ray.

10:50.760 --> 10:51.760
That's right.

10:51.760 --> 10:56.920
And, and then I use Plex to manage the sampling. So if I'm watching it on my HTC one, Plex

10:56.920 --> 10:58.680
manages the downscaling for me.

10:58.680 --> 11:02.400
And you don't have to worry about it. It's great. It just works really, really well.

11:02.400 --> 11:06.520
And there's such great Blu-ray ripping software out there for Linux. It's like a no brainer.

11:06.520 --> 11:10.400
Yeah. We did an episode a while back on last, um, on backing up that stuff. You know, the

11:10.400 --> 11:16.200
thing that I'm, I'm really loving these days is, uh, make MKV. I just think that's where

11:16.200 --> 11:19.400
I've been. I mean, Handbrake's great. Don't get me wrong, but I've just, I don't need

11:19.400 --> 11:21.720
all that. You know, I just need it simple.

11:21.720 --> 11:25.920
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, Ickmyre or he told me how to say it, but I can't help but say Ick. He

11:25.920 --> 11:29.940
lives in Washington too. We just outed him. Sorry to do that on the air, uh, Ick. Anyways,

11:29.940 --> 11:35.320
he suggests that we need, uh, uh, a JB Plex app. If anybody out there wants to make us

11:35.320 --> 11:39.600
a JB Plex plugin, that would be awesome. Ickmyre, sorry. Uh, and Linux newbie said, did I mean

11:39.600 --> 11:46.880
H two 64 and not X? No, I mean, so I mean, uh, H two 64 is, um, is, uh, everybody knows

11:46.880 --> 11:52.560
what H two 64 is. X two 64 is an open source re-implementation of it. And it is so much

11:52.560 --> 11:57.120
better. Like, and, and this is coming from somebody who initially on X two 64 was very

11:57.120 --> 12:01.760
skeptical. I'm very skeptical on web M and VP eight. I'm hopeful for VP nine. I've also

12:01.760 --> 12:04.480
been a doubter on, um, Theora.

12:04.480 --> 12:07.920
I think Theora was, Theora has been garbage as long as I can remember. It's adorable,

12:07.920 --> 12:08.920
but it's just garbage.

12:08.920 --> 12:12.480
It's just not, it's just not a serious solution for distribution of media. And I think that's

12:12.480 --> 12:16.680
one of the reasons why it struggled to take off. Um, and so, uh, but one of the things,

12:16.680 --> 12:20.520
and I was initially a skeptic of X two 64. Oh, it's just a, you know, it's gonna, it's

12:20.520 --> 12:24.080
a rip off. It's a clone. How can it, it's always going to be in catch up mode. Well,

12:24.080 --> 12:28.680
I was totally wrong about that. Uh, H two 64 stagnates for the most part because of

12:28.680 --> 12:33.280
the, a mass amount of interests that are involved with it. And X two 64 has managed to maintain

12:33.280 --> 12:38.560
compatibility as needed. I mean, you do have to watch yourself, but, uh, the, everything

12:38.560 --> 12:43.840
about it is better. The picture it delivers is superior to H two 64 it's open source code.

12:43.840 --> 12:48.240
That's superior. Um, and the encoding times are better because it's more efficient at

12:48.240 --> 12:52.520
taking advantage of multi-core, you know, my Bonobo, it will light up all four real

12:52.520 --> 12:57.200
cores and all four virtual cores completely maxed out, uh, as it rips through video using

12:57.200 --> 13:02.480
FFmpeg. Um, it's really great. So that's really awesome. Well, and I, and if memory serves

13:02.480 --> 13:05.960
me, and it's been a while since I've tried it, uh, on Vorbis, you know, for the audio

13:05.960 --> 13:10.680
stuff, I don't recall that being bad. No, no, Vorbis is fine. Yeah. Vorbis was great

13:10.680 --> 13:15.480
for audio, but yeah, it was the video where we always had the, it was muddy or was choppy

13:15.480 --> 13:22.480
or suffers from that. Not, not good, but not better enough than MP3. And since it's almost

13:22.480 --> 13:26.880
the same to me. Yeah. All right. Well, so, uh, we got, we got some steam stuff. I mean,

13:26.880 --> 13:30.920
this is, we knew we talked about it on Linux action show on Sunday. We said Monday, they're

13:30.920 --> 13:33.840
going to announce this. I was watching the countdown that happened while we were recording

13:33.840 --> 13:39.920
quarter radio. So my, my, my immediate, as the, uh, as the page went live reactions were

13:39.920 --> 13:46.120
captured in Kota radio and it's funny. And I don't necessarily think this was, I don't

13:46.120 --> 13:49.800
think this, I don't think this now, but at the time my first reaction was, Oh, this is

13:49.800 --> 13:54.580
a huge slap in the face to Ubuntu. Right. That was my, my, my first immediate reaction

13:54.580 --> 13:59.640
was, Oh, canonical thinks or a valve doesn't trust the canonical is going to deliver on

13:59.640 --> 14:03.440
the desktop. They don't think they can hitch their boat that way or their, their car to

14:03.440 --> 14:07.640
that wagon or to that horse. Well, you know, I think it's like the old saying, go, go is,

14:07.640 --> 14:11.400
uh, you know, trust, but verify. And I think that's kind of what they did. Um, I think

14:11.400 --> 14:14.640
they said, Oh yeah, no, we're, we're totally hip to you guys. But in, in addition to being

14:14.640 --> 14:17.120
hip to you guys and being down with what you're doing, we're going to go ahead and do this

14:17.120 --> 14:21.560
project over here just in case, you know? Well, and like so many people like to do there,

14:21.560 --> 14:25.880
we believe they're going to base demoize off of Ubuntu, but before we get to all of that,

14:25.880 --> 14:32.840
I want to thank our first sponsor this week, Ting.com. Ting, Matt, mobile that makes sense.

14:32.840 --> 14:39.120
Yes, sir. Mobile that makes sense because Ting has no early termination fees, no contracts.

14:39.120 --> 14:43.600
No contracts. Yes, that's right. No contracts. And you only pay for what you use. In fact,

14:43.600 --> 14:47.360
let's just start with this this week. One of the things I love about Ting is their rates.

14:47.360 --> 14:50.040
They break out your rates by minutes, text message and megabytes, and they bill you at

14:50.040 --> 14:53.080
the end of the month for whatever bucket you fall into. So if you don't use your voice

14:53.080 --> 14:56.800
very much, but you use a lot of data like I do, well then you end up paying an extremely

14:56.800 --> 15:01.600
reasonable rate. I think my bill right now is around $14. It's incredible. And since

15:01.600 --> 15:06.000
it's the way they base this is you can have multiple devices on one account with a pooled

15:06.000 --> 15:10.320
amount of minutes. You just pay that $6. There's a flat $6 for the line. Bam, you've got a

15:10.320 --> 15:13.560
line you own. Then from that point on, you only pay for what you use. So if that, if

15:13.560 --> 15:16.520
that device sits on your desk for a month, you don't have to worry about the gadget guilt

15:16.520 --> 15:22.320
of not using it. And Ting is making a lot of great new improvements. LTE lit up all

15:22.320 --> 15:26.160
over the place. They have a goal of 200 million people covered by LTE coverage by the end

15:26.160 --> 15:31.240
of 2013. They just turned on 34 new cities, tons of new coverage in Texas, and they just

15:31.240 --> 15:36.040
got the Moto X. This is probably the Android phone to have now, which, shh, my HTC One

15:36.040 --> 15:41.120
is in air shot. You don't want to make it jealous, Chris. I know, I know, Matt, but

15:41.120 --> 15:46.080
this HTC One is looking really, really good. But if you're still considering something

15:46.080 --> 15:51.680
else, maybe something a little of the larger variety like, oh, I don't know, the new Note

15:51.680 --> 15:55.680
3. Well, good news because Ting has announced that the Note 3 will be hitting Ting. And

15:55.680 --> 15:59.440
now Matt, you know, you know, when you have a big screen like that, this thing's going

15:59.440 --> 16:06.440
to support a 5.7 inch screen. You ready for this? Three gigabytes of RAM and a 13 megapixel

16:06.720 --> 16:10.560
camera. Let me put this in perspective. My main desktop computer, not, not the one I'm

16:10.560 --> 16:14.480
on now, which has more RAM, but my main desktop has two gigabytes of RAM. I want to really

16:14.480 --> 16:19.800
let that sink in for folks. I think people, if you haven't tried it on a large screen

16:19.800 --> 16:23.840
device, that when you have, when you're taking a picture on something like the Note, the

16:23.840 --> 16:27.960
screen is so big, you get such a good idea of what that picture is going to turn out

16:27.960 --> 16:32.760
like and the framing of it. So, so, you know, man, Note 3 coming out, they just rolled out

16:32.760 --> 16:38.200
the Note, I'm sorry, the Moto X. And the good news is, and it doesn't stop there, the LG

16:38.200 --> 16:43.000
G2, the high-end Android smartphone that packs useful features and unique design with a 1080p

16:43.000 --> 16:49.160
5.2 inch screen, 2.3 inch, or I'm sorry, 2.3 gigahertz quad core processor and a 3000

16:49.160 --> 16:54.120
milliamp battery. They're going to have the G2 coming out on the Ting network as well.

16:54.120 --> 17:00.340
That's also got Android 4.2. It's got a tri-band LTE antenna in that thing. And they've also

17:00.340 --> 17:04.680
got some new refurbished feature phones. If you want something real straightforward, you'll

17:04.680 --> 17:06.180
see those in early October.

17:06.180 --> 17:10.320
Get something for the family, you know? And I have a real quick, super quick plug that

17:10.320 --> 17:14.920
I want to do for Ting that I experienced and I talked about on the show last week. And

17:14.920 --> 17:18.720
that was where I went a little bit over on my data. Not a lot, just a little bit. And

17:18.720 --> 17:21.680
I'm thinking, OK, I'm probably going to get rolled into the next plan, no big deal. I'm

17:21.680 --> 17:25.360
going to roll into the next bucket, rather. OK, that's fine. Guess what happens? I get

17:25.360 --> 17:29.920
an email saying, hey, you went a little over. We're going to eat that cost, and we're not

17:29.920 --> 17:31.600
going to charge you extra for it.

17:31.600 --> 17:32.600
That's awesome, isn't it?

17:32.600 --> 17:33.600
What's up with that, right?

17:33.600 --> 17:34.600
They're awesome.

17:34.600 --> 17:35.600
Whoa!

17:35.600 --> 17:37.440
Yeah, they're awesome. And now they have an early termination fee relief program. So

17:37.440 --> 17:41.120
if you're canceling a contract at your current provider, Ting will help you take the sting

17:41.120 --> 17:45.360
out of that. You just go get your phone, port your number, then submit your ETF claim, and

17:45.360 --> 17:50.040
it'll take up to $75 off your ETF. That's a great deal. They've also announced that they'll

17:50.040 --> 17:57.680
be rolling out a new LTE hotspot, the Zing Mobile Hotspot MyFive 5000 LTE. Now, you combine

17:57.680 --> 18:02.960
the Ting fantastic rates with an LTE hotspot, and the fact that you only pay for what you

18:02.960 --> 18:06.680
use. So if you don't use it very much for a month or so, no big deal. That's a killer

18:06.680 --> 18:13.000
deal. That's incredible. So go to linux.ting.com. Linux.ting.com will take $25 off your first

18:13.000 --> 18:18.760
device or, if you want to bring your own device, well guess what? $25 off your first month.

18:18.760 --> 18:23.200
Since the average Ting bill is like $21, it might mean your first month is free. And then

18:23.200 --> 18:26.200
later on, if you decide you want to get the Moto X or you decide you want to do something

18:26.200 --> 18:29.760
else, you can. You can grab it. And it's super easy to do through the Ting website to get

18:29.760 --> 18:33.980
them all set up and get it activated. And you combine that with their super, super wonderful

18:33.980 --> 18:40.900
customer support, 1-855-846-4389. You call in anytime between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern

18:40.900 --> 18:45.040
and a real person will answer the phone. That's just so great. That is so awesome. So go to

18:45.040 --> 18:50.840
linux.ting.com. And thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. Big thank you. So there I

18:50.840 --> 18:56.560
was, the end of Coder Radio, and Valve has to go and make a big announcement, Matt. And

18:56.560 --> 19:03.800
the thing that struck me in this announcement, just like did not see it coming. And to your

19:03.800 --> 19:09.040
credit, you totally, totally, totally called it at like the 36-minute mark in the Linux

19:09.040 --> 19:13.040
action show last week. I'm going to play a clip. Steam box. And I think, you know, I

19:13.040 --> 19:16.360
look at what the Ouya did. We've covered it a lot on Coder Radio. I look at what a lot

19:16.360 --> 19:19.880
of these other companies are doing. I think Valve's the one that has the right approach.

19:19.880 --> 19:24.560
And the fact that it'd be powered by Linux makes me ecstatic. Screw you, Xbox. Screw

19:24.560 --> 19:27.920
you, Xbox. I'm getting the Steam box. You know, the more I think about it, the more

19:27.920 --> 19:32.000
I'm thinking, keep going back to what he said about the whole embracing the PC culture and

19:32.000 --> 19:36.420
the fact that you can expand on it. It's open and so on and so forth. What if the box is

19:36.420 --> 19:40.320
essentially a gaming thin client for your existing computer? Because if you think about

19:40.320 --> 19:44.000
it, it sounds dumb at first, but if you stop and think about it, it's like, okay, I've

19:44.000 --> 19:49.120
got my Steam box. Okay. Wow. You know, I really want to upgrade that hardware. Yeah. But if

19:49.120 --> 19:52.280
you have a box that doesn't care and it's pulling it in from, I'm not saying that's

19:52.280 --> 19:55.680
what it is. I'm just saying it's a possibility. I would say you called it, Matt. You totally

19:55.680 --> 20:00.720
called it. That's one of the key features of a Steam OS. Yes, that's right. Ladies and

20:00.720 --> 20:05.740
gentlemen, Steam OS. So this was the teaser last year. We shipped a software feature called

20:05.740 --> 20:10.760
Big Picture, a user interface, interface, interface tailored for televisions and K-pads.

20:10.760 --> 20:14.360
This year we're working on even more ways to connect the dots, dots, dots, dots for customers

20:14.360 --> 20:18.520
who want Steam in the living room. Soon we'll be adding your design process so you can help

20:18.520 --> 20:23.320
us shape the future. Now here's what we've got. Steam OS, so far what we know is going

20:23.320 --> 20:26.920
to be a platform by Valve that they're going to offer out for free for people to deploy

20:26.920 --> 20:31.360
on their hardware. They can make Steam boxes. Uh, we don't know for sure yet, but we believe

20:31.360 --> 20:36.060
that Steam and Valve will announce a reference platform that you should follow. It'll be

20:36.060 --> 20:41.520
Nvidia based. It'll probably be of a mid-range spec and it'll be running Steam OS. Steam

20:41.520 --> 20:46.400
OS primarily is going to be based off Ubuntu. It has, of course, a Valve spin on it. There's

20:46.400 --> 20:50.440
already repos up online. There have been for a while. We actually covered them like five

20:50.440 --> 20:55.920
weeks ago on the Linux Action Show. There's been repos that you could connect to. Um,

20:55.920 --> 21:00.440
they have been building them out and they've been calling it Home Test, which has been

21:00.440 --> 21:04.600
obviously short for people who have Steam OS installed at home or are getting updates.

21:04.600 --> 21:07.640
This has been around since April. So this is all something they've been building. Of

21:07.640 --> 21:10.480
course, they've been working with Nvidia a lot. They've been working with the different,

21:10.480 --> 21:15.120
uh, um, different parties on, on getting like a debugger built for Linux. And I love those

21:15.120 --> 21:18.680
things because that's going to ensure not that it just exists, but it exists and it

21:18.680 --> 21:23.640
works really, really well. Right. So we've been, so we've been seeing Valve very subtly,

21:23.640 --> 21:28.160
very intelligently move towards the living room. One of the things that, uh, is I think

21:28.160 --> 21:33.680
of particular interest is, uh, 40% of all games on Steam feature some sort of, and by

21:33.680 --> 21:39.160
the way, I mean Linux games, 40% of all Linux games on Steam support some type of, some

21:39.160 --> 21:44.920
level of controller support. So that amounts to 70 to 72 games of the total that are available

21:44.920 --> 21:50.520
for Linux right now have controller support. However, when big picture mode was launched

21:50.520 --> 21:56.560
last September, 23.7% of games available on Steam were listed with full or partial controller

21:56.560 --> 22:01.800
support. That was 382 games total on Steam of games that have launched on Steam since

22:01.800 --> 22:08.200
big picture has been launched about 48.4% of all of the featured or all full fee, all

22:08.200 --> 22:12.400
of the games have featured or have full feature or partial feature for controller support,

22:12.400 --> 22:18.960
raising the total pop population of games on Steam to nearly 30% or 617 games in total

22:18.960 --> 22:23.640
now on Steam have controller support. So they've been working on this for a while, right? As

22:23.640 --> 22:27.320
a part of that critical infrastructure piece, then they announced, you know, we're going

22:27.320 --> 22:31.760
to, we're going to also announce some AAA titles. Uh, we assume those will have controller

22:31.760 --> 22:35.160
support and they say, Oh, and Hey, don't worry if you've got, if you've got a steam library

22:35.160 --> 22:38.440
full of stuff, but it's on windows, we're going to stream that for you. Oh, and by the

22:38.440 --> 22:42.680
way, don't forget, we've also just enabled family sharing and that's something I got

22:42.680 --> 22:47.960
to hit you up on. I got to borrow some of those games. I got a 16 year old over here

22:47.960 --> 22:51.160
more, you know, games will be needing, I'll tell you, but I'm excited for this cause now

22:51.160 --> 22:54.360
I'm seeing it from his eyes and you know, seeing it from a whole new perspective of

22:54.360 --> 23:00.680
the sense of discovery. And it's just so exciting to see this happen, you know? So my, uh, my,

23:00.680 --> 23:06.920
my prediction is here that, uh, we're going to have ourselves, uh, pop may be, I don't

23:06.920 --> 23:10.680
think so, but maybe a hardware pre-order tomorrow. I don't think so though. I think we're just

23:10.680 --> 23:14.600
gonna see a reference design, but I think we're going to see some sort of maybe potential

23:14.600 --> 23:18.840
partnership announced with Nvidia. To me, it seems logical that the streaming technology

23:18.840 --> 23:23.160
they're talking about is the Nvidia shield technology, but I think so. I think you nailed

23:23.160 --> 23:27.160
it. I think you called that one. I would completely agree with that. That's just making sense.

23:27.160 --> 23:31.240
It ensures that five, you know, two, three years, five years down the road, whatever

23:31.240 --> 23:34.600
it may be, there aren't going to be any conflicts or issues because the partnerships already

23:34.600 --> 23:39.560
in place, they have an equal interest in keeping that stuff on par. So this is to me, there

23:39.560 --> 23:43.880
are so many interesting aspects to talk about this from what's it going to mean for Linux?

23:43.880 --> 23:47.680
What's it going to mean for other distros like arch and open Sousa and fedora? What's

23:47.680 --> 23:52.640
it going to mean for developers? I mean, there's so many different angles we can talk about,

23:52.640 --> 23:57.240
but before we move off from the launch day announcement and what was announced, I want

23:57.240 --> 24:00.840
to open it up to the mumble room and say, guys, is there any aspect of the announcement

24:00.840 --> 24:05.280
or something that came out in the news that was particularly noteworthy to you? Anything

24:05.280 --> 24:11.520
around with, you know, what you hope to see tomorrow announced? I'll leave that to you

24:11.520 --> 24:23.920
guys now, buddy. I was surprised by the of being able to use your windows games on Linux,

24:23.920 --> 24:29.120
which people do leave their computers running in an office while they're in the living room.

24:29.120 --> 24:36.000
So hey, right. You're going to have to have a machine running occupied to do that streaming

24:36.000 --> 24:41.000
because theoretically the streaming processing will take place on the windows PC, but it's

24:41.000 --> 24:46.360
over the land. So it's not like what online was trying to do so much. This is true. I

24:46.360 --> 24:53.240
guess I'm just looking for if it has really good updating features, because I know a lot

24:53.240 --> 24:58.400
of people don't want to deal with updates, especially on Linux. Right. Yeah, they'd have

24:58.400 --> 25:04.040
they'd they'd have they'd have to have their own system wide updater that sort of took

25:04.040 --> 25:09.680
care of steam updates, system updates, game updates. And I think, you know, we've had

25:09.680 --> 25:13.240
we have I'll leave it up to the folks in the mumble room, but we've had folks in the mumble

25:13.240 --> 25:18.640
room who have connected to some steam repos, pulled down some packages and seeing that

25:18.640 --> 25:25.520
there is their own like valve updater in the repo. And it doesn't necessarily sound like

25:25.520 --> 25:32.720
it has to be on Ubuntu 12.04 either could potentially work on 13.04 that now that could

25:32.720 --> 25:36.520
be interesting, although that's going to be an interesting release, you know? Yeah, no.

25:36.520 --> 25:40.680
All right. Well, so here's where I think we should take this chat. And I think this is

25:40.680 --> 25:46.200
something first thing I think I want to talk about is. So envision I think we're going

25:46.200 --> 25:50.720
to envision something like an XBMC almost style distro based on Ubuntu 12.04 boots up

25:50.720 --> 25:55.360
right in the steam big picture mode. And, you know, we've seen we've seen that, you

25:55.360 --> 25:58.760
know, Ubuntu has been valves focus since they started steam for Linux. They already have

25:58.760 --> 26:03.820
a repository for it. I think this will be just something they'll make available to folks.

26:03.820 --> 26:06.680
And I think that they'll say, we recommend these specs, we recommend this hardware, but

26:06.680 --> 26:10.840
you can do more video, you can do more CPU. But what I want to ask you, Matt, is what

26:10.840 --> 26:16.120
do you think this means for OpenSUSE? What do you think this means for Arch? Honestly,

26:16.120 --> 26:19.000
nothing, because I think they cater to different groups of people. I think they cater to people

26:19.000 --> 26:22.440
with different goal sets and different interests. You know, there's always that, you know, do

26:22.440 --> 26:26.280
we need to worry about some sort of evil division or whatnot? Do you think they're going to

26:26.280 --> 26:32.200
create so Michael Dominic suggested that perhaps they're going to Androidify only to be steamify.

26:32.200 --> 26:35.600
It's going to be maybe they maybe they're going to use, you know, their own display

26:35.600 --> 26:39.440
manager. Maybe they'll use mere. Maybe they'll use, you know, they're they're they're going

26:39.440 --> 26:46.240
to kind of over time become their own integrated solution, a customized separate kind of. Oh,

26:46.240 --> 26:50.000
I think so. I think, you know, just like, you know, as you said, Android Androidify,

26:50.000 --> 26:53.400
I think, you know, you look at Android and then you'll also look at the fact that other

26:53.400 --> 26:57.480
operating systems are actually finding their way into the world. Firefox, for example,

26:57.480 --> 27:03.480
things like that. So going back to the steam OS, I think, will that affect other distros?

27:03.480 --> 27:10.120
No, I don't. I think that there's enough non specific interest to that space that everything

27:10.120 --> 27:14.320
will remain strong. And as it is, I know that means that I do predict a lot of the sky is

27:14.320 --> 27:18.760
falling from news outlets and folks on blogs and whatnot. Everybody's going to be freaking

27:18.760 --> 27:23.080
out. Oh my God, Ubuntu and steam and all these guys are just big poo poo heads and they're

27:23.080 --> 27:26.960
ruining everything. And we're going to hear lots of that nonsense like we always do. But

27:26.960 --> 27:27.960
it's not going to happen.

27:27.960 --> 27:30.920
You know, so I'll play a little bit of this clip. I'll go back to something we played

27:30.920 --> 27:39.000
on Sunday. Yeah. On the other hand, PC gaming seems to have been immune to this back up

27:39.000 --> 27:44.840
because we actually didn't play this part in peace to sort of double down on that rather

27:44.840 --> 27:51.480
than going that the way that they should have responded is very much to key off. And that

27:51.480 --> 27:59.560
was a very seductive opportunity. I'll let him play this. So one of the things Gabe talked

27:59.560 --> 28:03.000
about in his keynote is that locking down the ecosystem, integrating the stream line,

28:03.000 --> 28:07.480
it has actually led to less innovation, which has led to the decline of the industry. Interesting

28:07.480 --> 28:13.040
point. So he may not lock it down. It is very much to key off of the strength of, you know,

28:13.040 --> 28:20.280
the openness of the systems we had and sort of double down on that rather than going going

28:20.280 --> 28:27.680
the other way. So jumping forward, what are we looking at now? We're looking at steady

28:27.680 --> 28:36.640
year over year unit declines in PC sales. And so I think, you know, I kind of I'm I'm

28:36.640 --> 28:41.120
I'm filling in and connecting a lot of dots for that could lead me to be very disappointed

28:41.120 --> 28:44.600
down the road. But to me, it sounds like one of the things that's turned them on about

28:44.600 --> 28:52.120
Linux is the fact that it is this sort of it's the it's the Internet of operating systems

28:52.120 --> 28:56.100
in the sense that it's this open, common, connected platform that anybody can put their

28:56.100 --> 29:04.500
goods on and sell. And and I think what if if Valve is successful here, Valve will take

29:04.500 --> 29:09.560
the term Linux and take the general public thinking around Linux, too. Oh, that scares

29:09.560 --> 29:14.360
consumers and it's too hard. So we're not going to brand Linux like Google doesn't Brown

29:14.360 --> 29:19.800
brand the Chromecast as the Linux Chromecast. They just it's Chromecast, right? Because

29:19.800 --> 29:24.920
like we talked about last week, Linux is scary. Exactly. It is scary. No, I think it'll be

29:24.920 --> 29:29.500
interesting to see what they do. I do believe that at some level they may end up using something

29:29.500 --> 29:34.120
like mirror or they may end up using something that would arguably be, quote unquote, you

29:34.120 --> 29:38.420
know, locked down in the sense that it's not as widely popular or something like Wayland

29:38.420 --> 29:43.760
or whatnot. But that doesn't but that doesn't mean that they won't go and take this and

29:43.760 --> 29:46.960
make this to where you can run it the way you want it. You can take their OS and run

29:46.960 --> 29:50.320
it on any darn thing you please. I believe they'll make that possible. And they may even

29:50.320 --> 29:54.660
just go do that through APIs. And if they're successful, if they're successful at doing

29:54.660 --> 29:59.160
this, then they'll go from Linux is scary to Linux is the platform where there isn't

29:59.160 --> 30:02.640
a special interest controlling it and I can sell my stuff. And it'll have to be something

30:02.640 --> 30:06.600
snappier than that. It'll be Linux is the Internet of platforms or something ridiculous

30:06.600 --> 30:11.440
like cloud or vlog or whatever. Sure. Tweet. But it'll be like I think we could actually

30:11.440 --> 30:15.440
go from to like Linux is this place where people are going to go to sell their goods

30:15.440 --> 30:18.880
potentially. We'll see. I don't know. Well, I think it could at least help with the image

30:18.880 --> 30:23.040
of Linux quite a bit. One thing I've learned watching steam over a period of time, as well

30:23.040 --> 30:27.020
as watching other games in general, there are two industries and technology that define

30:27.020 --> 30:32.760
media formats and that define direction, porn and gaming. Right now, gaming is going with

30:32.760 --> 30:36.240
Linux. All we got to do now is get porn on board worse. And it's good. Everybody's music.

30:36.240 --> 30:41.160
And I wonder too, isn't sort of like the you know, like you're right, like maybe it's gaming

30:41.160 --> 30:46.320
comes here first and then other industries join along. But yeah, there's those two defining

30:46.320 --> 30:51.440
industries that really historically define everything. I mean, they literally take direction

30:51.440 --> 30:57.000
of media. They take direction of technology, even DRM. Yeah. You know what? Porn is going

30:57.000 --> 31:05.360
to have a hard time in stores. I actually have something. Yeah. Well, I just think if

31:05.360 --> 31:14.600
Valve does get successful at boasting Steam and having Steam on Linux, I think most people's

31:14.600 --> 31:22.880
opinion will be like, Linux is for gaming because Valve made it very successful. You

31:22.880 --> 31:30.040
know what I mean? Yeah. It could change like the whole perception around it, couldn't it?

31:30.040 --> 31:35.720
Because like it makes Linux more appealing to say the younger crowd because the younger

31:35.720 --> 31:40.400
crowd obviously wants to have really awesome games and really awesome graphics at the same

31:40.400 --> 31:46.300
time. Right. Well, and I think Valve is in a, I know, okay. So I guess here's the question

31:46.300 --> 31:52.080
is so Valve has a lot of clout. Steam's a great platform. I went and I Wikipedia'd out

31:52.080 --> 32:00.000
the numbers here. Here you go. Here's a little bit of, here's some math for you. Steam, we'll

32:00.000 --> 32:07.280
put it this way. Xbox Live has 46 million active users as of February, 2013. Okay. Xbox

32:07.280 --> 32:13.800
Live 46 million. PlayStation Network, if you combine all of the PlayStation consoles with

32:13.800 --> 32:17.240
all of like the Vita handhelds and all the handhelds they've sold, PlayStation Network

32:17.240 --> 32:22.320
is a hundred million active users. That's quite a bit. But Steam actually has a very

32:22.320 --> 32:29.120
respectable 60 million active users. Wow. So if you get 60 million active users, you've

32:29.120 --> 32:36.120
got some leverage there to incentivize game makers and you could do it across the entire

32:36.120 --> 32:39.600
store. So you could say, all right, a big AAA developer, if you're willing to make the

32:39.600 --> 32:43.520
game for our Steam box, we'll give you a higher cut of your sales across the entire Steam

32:43.520 --> 32:49.600
store. Like Valve has some room here to, you know, lean on developers to create something

32:49.600 --> 32:53.320
for Linux. So I think that's the key right there. I think if they say, look, you're already

32:53.320 --> 32:56.840
on these other platforms, you make these, you know, you make the needed modifications

32:56.840 --> 32:59.720
to come to us, we're going to give you a bigger piece of the pie. And oh, by the way, this

32:59.720 --> 33:03.200
is essentially a brand new market because they're opening up in the living room. Big

33:03.200 --> 33:08.360
deal. You know, it's a big deal. No doubt. They have excellent pull against, you know,

33:08.360 --> 33:15.360
developers because they have a huge base to work off of. And a huge customer base with

33:15.920 --> 33:22.000
a good history of willing to buy products. You combine that with their pushing forward

33:22.000 --> 33:26.440
on a lot of the fundamental aspects of Linux support. So they've been sort of changing

33:26.440 --> 33:32.520
that image already with making the game performance faster, delivering their own games to Linux.

33:32.520 --> 33:36.400
Steam with a lot of the back end features of Steam, I mean, the elephant in the room

33:36.400 --> 33:43.200
is this is all commercial, this is all DRM. But the plus sides for Linux to me seem really

33:43.200 --> 33:47.960
quite obvious in this scenario. I mean, this is a huge, this will be huge for Linux because

33:47.960 --> 33:51.760
it sounds like in everything we're reading and everything we can infer is this thing's

33:51.760 --> 33:56.080
going to follow pretty closely to mainline Linux. And I think what you'd end up having

33:56.080 --> 34:02.040
for better or for worse is a quote unquote official standard for what Steam compatibility

34:02.040 --> 34:05.480
needs to look like. And it's not like the standard in the sense that we went to a board

34:05.480 --> 34:09.080
and a board came up with a consensus that all distros will follow. But what it is is

34:09.080 --> 34:13.440
that every distro that wants to make a Steam game work can look at how it works on the

34:13.440 --> 34:17.920
Steam OS and then do whatever kind of silly hacks they have to do to make it work on Arch

34:17.920 --> 34:21.360
or OpenSUSE. Just like, you know, I mean, we get pipeline, I mean, hell man, we can

34:21.360 --> 34:26.720
go watch Silverlight DRMed Netflix videos now on Linux. The Linux community is amazing

34:26.720 --> 34:30.320
and making things work under their distro that are not designed for their distro. So

34:30.320 --> 34:34.660
as long as we have a model to follow, which the Steam OS will be this quote unquote game

34:34.660 --> 34:38.800
standard base that will follow. This will be the Steam base that we all follow now and

34:38.800 --> 34:42.880
then we can make whatever they get working there, we can replicate it on different environments.

34:42.880 --> 34:43.880
Yeah.

34:43.880 --> 34:48.120
Yeah, but Chris, I kind of feel like that it's then also very important that in the

34:48.120 --> 34:52.280
upcoming announcements, there is going to be a Steam box because without a reference

34:52.280 --> 34:56.900
implementation of the hardware, like a real reference implementation, it might not really

34:56.900 --> 35:00.760
take off as much as we hope. And then it's all been all for nothing.

35:00.760 --> 35:06.240
I agree. I think if, you know, okay, so here's the problem. So say they do a Google route

35:06.240 --> 35:10.280
and they make a Nexus device, right? Well, who the hell is going to order anything but

35:10.280 --> 35:16.320
the Steam valve box? No, I mean, that sucks all the air out of the room. So what they

35:16.320 --> 35:21.000
really need is to work with companies like new egg and have like the new egg Steam box.

35:21.000 --> 35:27.000
And we could have like a Linux action show Steam box. And then I, I agree that you need,

35:27.000 --> 35:32.400
I hope, I hope that system 76 might do something like that because the, the only other device

35:32.400 --> 35:36.280
we have seen is the piston and that thing costs a thousand dollars and that's just too

35:36.280 --> 35:40.840
much. Well, isn't that the interesting thing is a company like system 76 could take a Steam

35:40.840 --> 35:47.680
box and make one, but would anybody buy one? Could they make it cheap enough is really

35:47.680 --> 35:53.360
the hard thing to come up with because Sony and expo and Microsoft sort of have this economy

35:53.360 --> 35:57.280
of scale where they can make things cheap and then they can charge for licensing and

35:57.280 --> 36:00.600
games and they can charge for Xbox live and whatnot. But what does Steve, what does valve

36:00.600 --> 36:09.600
really have in their hardware? What if valve gave a system 76 or somebody else, you know,

36:09.600 --> 36:16.680
they give them a cut. Hey, you get 10%, 20% of the purchase of every game and maybe go

36:16.680 --> 36:23.600
ahead. Okay. With regard to that, we, if it is that steam bless one particular vendor

36:23.600 --> 36:28.300
over another, then you would have people who don't know about Linux, don't know about companies

36:28.300 --> 36:33.920
like system 76 and so forth that will eventually have to go to these companies to get their

36:33.920 --> 36:39.420
stuff just as well as I think you might have a couple of quote unquote blessed vendors,

36:39.420 --> 36:42.960
but it's going to be an ISO you can download, I think. Yeah, I'm sure it will be. It just

36:42.960 --> 36:46.720
makes sense because it's as much coverage as possible. I mean, as far as getting back

36:46.720 --> 36:50.560
to the steam box itself, one thing that we really need to remember too, is that if you're

36:50.560 --> 36:56.960
married you generally have to consider what I like to call a front room real estate. Yeah.

36:56.960 --> 37:00.400
And there's others on others. You have certain consoles that are, that have been blessed

37:00.400 --> 37:03.800
to be there. They serve their purpose, but to add another console and then to have to

37:03.800 --> 37:06.120
argue, well, we're now we're going to need a bigger cabinet or, well, we're going to

37:06.120 --> 37:10.840
have to rearrange that. As silly as it may seem, that does come up. You know, it would

37:10.840 --> 37:14.840
here anyway. And so that, you know, so size and proportion. And I think the question would

37:14.840 --> 37:18.800
be asked, does it play Netflix? Does it play? Yeah, seriously. No, that's a legitimate question.

37:18.800 --> 37:23.960
Does it play, does it play either games and or content that your spouse is into? On the

37:23.960 --> 37:29.800
page, it states that they are talking to content providers. It's vague though. It's vague.

37:29.800 --> 37:34.480
That could be a YouTube app for all we know. Right. Oh gosh. Yeah, no kidding. And we'll

37:34.480 --> 37:38.800
just say, I can't answer your question about hardware costs. I mean, you've got the Linux

37:38.800 --> 37:44.000
kernel, so it's pretty much adaptable to anything. So it's adaptable, but you still have to have

37:44.000 --> 37:47.800
something that runs the games well. And so it's kind of hard for them to vet it. It's

37:47.800 --> 37:51.320
not like the Xbox where you have this fixed platform. And so all the software vendors

37:51.320 --> 37:55.480
sort of have a target hardware spec when they're designing the games. This thing needs to be

37:55.480 --> 38:01.160
very powerful to accommodate almost any game stole price. And I think the streaming kind

38:01.160 --> 38:05.920
of alleviates some of that. In fact, that gives them some flexibility, right? I also

38:05.920 --> 38:10.160
think that because Valve was working with like Nvidia about drivers and stuff like that,

38:10.160 --> 38:15.240
I do think they also need to work with AMD, but that's just my opinion. Oh, I'm sure they

38:15.240 --> 38:19.320
will. I'm sure they will. I think they would have more or less standard specs that will

38:19.320 --> 38:23.880
work with any game. And seeing that they have certain vendors who'd be blessed, like for

38:23.880 --> 38:29.640
example, they're working with Nvidia, people would tend to work towards getting Nvidia

38:29.640 --> 38:37.000
drivers working with their games. And you continue on that path. I think that Valve

38:37.000 --> 38:42.200
just needs to really focus and make sure they get this on the dot is to have driver implementation,

38:42.200 --> 38:48.040
correct? Yeah. Yeah. And because Valve has been doing business with Nvidia, they might

38:48.040 --> 38:53.400
already have a deal for a chip they can put in their box for a very good price. They might.

38:53.400 --> 38:57.280
I think price is crucial because they need to meet the price point of the PS4 and the

38:57.280 --> 39:02.280
Xbox One in order to get that console market share to get it really going and soon. And

39:02.280 --> 39:07.640
if they do that, then the developers will come to them to make the money. I don't think

39:07.640 --> 39:10.960
that will be hard. I think the way this has to work out, and I mean, the way I'd like

39:10.960 --> 39:17.200
to see it work out is if Valve could make a box where, you know, if I just fall ass

39:17.200 --> 39:21.200
backwards into buying a Steam box, I land on this thing. Like give me something for

39:21.200 --> 39:26.120
just the most simple basic consumer to go purchase. Maybe it's advertised in the Steam

39:26.120 --> 39:31.680
store itself. Maybe I could even buy it through Steam. But then make it available for anyone

39:31.680 --> 39:35.280
to build one. And the reason I think that is because like I was picturing pitching

39:35.280 --> 39:39.880
this to an Xbox fan, and like I think the question they would ask is, well, what controller

39:39.880 --> 39:44.480
can I use? And my answer would be like, well, Valve has a really great controller they spend

39:44.480 --> 39:48.600
a lot of time coming up with, but actually any controller that works with Linux you can

39:48.600 --> 39:52.400
use. If you want to use the 360 controller, you can. You want to use the PS4 controller,

39:52.400 --> 39:58.120
go for it. And so I think, you know, they need like the one-click purchase box that

39:58.120 --> 40:01.520
just comes with everything. That's the one you get at Christmas. That's the one that,

40:01.520 --> 40:05.200
you know, a real average user gets. But then later they could start building their own

40:05.200 --> 40:08.680
the next time they get one, or they could, you know, swap out the controller for their

40:08.680 --> 40:14.400
favorite console controller. And I think if they can walk that line, I agree with the

40:14.400 --> 40:20.340
Mumble Room. If they don't really have something in 2014 for me to buy, well then they better

40:20.340 --> 40:26.120
work really damn close with a few OEMs to have something. And it better be like, it

40:26.120 --> 40:31.920
better feel just like buying one from Valve.

40:31.920 --> 40:35.560
The controller points a good one, but one controller I'd like to see is just the standard

40:35.560 --> 40:40.240
keyboard and mouse because for me personally, I'm an RTS fan and I can't get that on a console.

40:40.240 --> 40:43.480
I think that's going to have to. I mean, I think, I think they'd have to, they'd have

40:43.480 --> 40:46.160
to probably, you know, hard code it not to work.

40:46.160 --> 40:49.560
Yeah, and that's the beauty of it being Linux is that that's something they should embrace

40:49.560 --> 40:53.720
that you can use a keyboard or mouse, you can use your preferred controller. And I think

40:53.720 --> 40:54.720
at the end of the day, you know, that's great.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.280
Which would be my preferred controller.

40:56.280 --> 40:57.280
Yeah.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.280
Yeah.

40:58.280 --> 41:02.440
That's going to be, that's going to be one of their major curb appeals right there.

41:02.440 --> 41:06.920
It is. Yeah. Because I was talking to my nephew about this. He's 16. He's like, well, can

41:06.920 --> 41:11.040
I use, can I use my, can I use the controller that I use on my existing console? And I said,

41:11.040 --> 41:14.320
probably. And he said, well, I'm on board. You know, he was good. He already has Steam

41:14.320 --> 41:15.320
games. He's good.

41:15.320 --> 41:19.800
What do you guys think about this streaming capability? Is this a band-aid or is this

41:19.800 --> 41:25.280
like a long-term, okay, here's the way I see it. It could be a, a bullet point to address

41:25.280 --> 41:29.280
the lack of AAA titles in the library, 200 Linux games, and only a handful of them are

41:29.280 --> 41:35.160
the ones people are like totally clamoring for. Or, or it could be a long-term strategy

41:35.160 --> 41:39.840
to say, kind of like Matt was saying in last, you know, this is really just a thin client.

41:39.840 --> 41:44.560
And while yeah, you can play native games on it. If you want to use this thing for five,

41:44.560 --> 41:48.000
five years, good on you. Just keep upgrading the video card in your PC and we'll just keep

41:48.000 --> 41:51.840
streaming it for as long as you want. Is this a short-term thing or is this a long-term

41:51.840 --> 41:52.840
thing?

41:52.840 --> 41:56.760
I think it's both. There's going to be some people that are just going to really want

41:56.760 --> 42:01.160
that thin client solution. And there's also some developers that will refuse to develop

42:01.160 --> 42:05.920
on Linux until it's inevitable that that's the primary gaming platform. And then there's

42:05.920 --> 42:09.440
going to be other developers that rush to support it. So I think it's really going to

42:09.440 --> 42:11.960
be both solutions, short and long-term.

42:11.960 --> 42:18.840
I do think that, I do think that they should probably work on trying to entice developers

42:18.840 --> 42:23.720
and show that it's actually easier to work with Linux than it is to work with Windows.

42:23.720 --> 42:29.400
Because the thing with Windows is that its kernel structure, yeah, it's very stable,

42:29.400 --> 42:33.400
but it's not that fast and you don't get the good performance and you don't get to have

42:33.400 --> 42:36.680
the capabilities that you do with Linux.

42:36.680 --> 42:45.200
So I feel like NVIDIA has this entirely new technology, the streaming technology, developed.

42:45.200 --> 42:48.680
And this is for them also a chance to make it like a standard.

42:48.680 --> 42:51.760
So you agree it's going to be the NVIDIA streaming tech?

42:51.760 --> 42:57.520
Yeah, because this is a chance for Valve as well as for NVIDIA.

42:57.520 --> 43:03.080
Yeah, the consoles went with AMD so NVIDIA could really sell some units here.

43:03.080 --> 43:07.760
And so I wonder then, if this is NVIDIA's streaming tech, it sounds like, I mean to

43:07.760 --> 43:12.360
me, and I don't know where the squares with NVIDIA saying they're going to provide documentation

43:12.360 --> 43:16.620
to the Novo project today, when you look at this, this to me seems like one of these features

43:16.620 --> 43:20.880
that absolutely will require the proprietary NVIDIA driver.

43:20.880 --> 43:21.880
It would.

43:21.880 --> 43:22.880
It definitely will.

43:22.880 --> 43:30.160
See, Alan in the chatroom thinks that streaming will never work, that it never works for games.

43:30.160 --> 43:35.400
Now I don't know, I don't know, see, I'm of a slightly different opinion because for me,

43:35.400 --> 43:40.280
I actually was able to play on live fairly successfully.

43:40.280 --> 43:43.120
And on live was going to servers up in the cloud.

43:43.120 --> 43:46.960
Now we don't know for sure, but I think everything points to the streaming is going to happen

43:46.960 --> 43:48.120
over the LAN.

43:48.120 --> 43:52.720
But where you're going to run into issues is everybody has really crappy Wi-Fi, right?

43:52.720 --> 43:56.200
At least in average homes, nobody's got their Wi-Fi figured out.

43:56.200 --> 44:01.320
There's a dozen different Wi-Fi APs just in range within my house.

44:01.320 --> 44:05.560
So people who are not wired are going to constantly have problems, I would say.

44:05.560 --> 44:08.480
Then it might scale down to 480p.

44:08.480 --> 44:14.560
My answer to Alan, my answer to him saying that streaming won't work, I think on live

44:14.560 --> 44:17.580
kind of failed just because they didn't have the coverage.

44:17.580 --> 44:22.720
They didn't have all the servers in place as they do now.

44:22.720 --> 44:25.600
I mean, I played on live for a while.

44:25.600 --> 44:30.400
I mean, it wasn't good because I wasn't in like a closer coverage area, but if they had

44:30.400 --> 44:36.600
more servers in like say one in Iowa or something like that, I would definitely be playing that

44:36.600 --> 44:37.600
and it would have been great.

44:37.600 --> 44:41.760
Yeah, and I think, you know, Cheeseburg in the burglary in the chat room makes a good

44:41.760 --> 44:42.760
point.

44:42.760 --> 44:44.480
You know, average Joe isn't probably going to be too impressed with the answer.

44:44.480 --> 44:48.560
Yeah, I can play your games is, well, I actually take that back because if you're asking the

44:48.560 --> 44:52.320
question, can it play game X, then you probably already have a PC and you already have that

44:52.320 --> 44:53.440
game and you want to be able to play it.

44:53.440 --> 44:55.120
So maybe actually.

44:55.120 --> 44:59.160
But taking it into the living room gives you better two player ability.

44:59.160 --> 45:01.480
You don't want to share your keyboard and mouse at your desk.

45:01.480 --> 45:04.480
So you're assuming they can still play it back at the desk.

45:04.480 --> 45:07.960
I would think it would take almost all the resources to just cause you're going to, I

45:07.960 --> 45:10.880
mean the game has to, the game has to run.

45:10.880 --> 45:14.360
I don't mean two player as in one person sitting at the desk and one person sitting

45:14.360 --> 45:15.360
in the living room.

45:15.360 --> 45:19.280
I'm talking about person a person B both watching the same TV in the living room.

45:19.280 --> 45:20.280
Yeah.

45:20.280 --> 45:21.280
Console style.

45:21.280 --> 45:22.280
Yeah.

45:22.280 --> 45:23.280
Yeah.

45:23.280 --> 45:24.280
Cause it is a console.

45:24.280 --> 45:26.740
Streaming is also an enticement to developers.

45:26.740 --> 45:31.640
If their game doesn't play as well over streaming and steam picks up a momentum, then they're

45:31.640 --> 45:35.040
going to want to develop natively for Linux so that it is competitive.

45:35.040 --> 45:36.040
Yeah, totally.

45:36.040 --> 45:37.040
Yeah.

45:37.040 --> 45:38.040
Yeah.

45:38.040 --> 45:39.040
I think that that would be the main point.

45:39.040 --> 45:44.120
Most of the games that eventually, especially windows only games, you'll start to see a

45:44.120 --> 45:50.440
dip in their games being played or being purchased because people want to use the steam box or

45:50.440 --> 45:55.520
the steam OS because they can actually play it on larger screens and everything like that.

45:55.520 --> 46:00.680
So eventually they would have to move over their games being played on Linux and will

46:00.680 --> 46:03.280
actually be a win-win right.

46:03.280 --> 46:06.120
Because in the other distros, we'll see how they got it working on steam OS and make it

46:06.120 --> 46:07.920
work on their distro of choice.

46:07.920 --> 46:08.920
Exactly.

46:08.920 --> 46:09.920
And that's going to be huge.

46:09.920 --> 46:10.920
Definitely.

46:10.920 --> 46:13.680
You know, I almost wonder if we're going to see something to where maybe it's kind of

46:13.680 --> 46:17.920
a hybrid to where, okay, you've got the, uh, you, you, maybe you've got like some local

46:17.920 --> 46:22.120
resources cached on the console itself and then the rest of it's being streamed in toward

46:22.120 --> 46:26.400
basically where, you know, kind of a minimizes congestion from valve.

46:26.400 --> 46:29.520
You know, I think people, I think, I think people would actually prefer that.

46:29.520 --> 46:32.880
I think people would prefer to be able to stream it from valve because then you could

46:32.880 --> 46:35.760
have somebody playing on the PC and you could have somebody playing on that.

46:35.760 --> 46:36.760
Yeah.

46:36.760 --> 46:39.840
Well, and if you cash local resources, like you cash in your, you got your maps cached,

46:39.840 --> 46:43.000
you got various, uh, things like rendering, right?

46:43.000 --> 46:46.440
That's where the, and that's where the seat, that's where the GPU is going to have to really,

46:46.440 --> 46:48.040
you know, the whole Nvidia thing comes into it.

46:48.040 --> 46:51.760
So, I mean, if they can kind of find that balancing act where, you know, there's still

46:51.760 --> 46:54.800
some, there's still some caching going on locally, you still got enough to where it's

46:54.800 --> 46:57.440
not just raw data going back and forth like crazy.

46:57.440 --> 46:58.440
It's basically just gameplay.

46:58.440 --> 46:59.440
Right.

46:59.440 --> 47:03.280
Um, you know, well, if you did it right, uh, and essentially what OnLive did, and this

47:03.280 --> 47:09.760
is why I think you could almost do it over a LAN is OnLive took, uh, either X264 or H264

47:09.760 --> 47:14.940
and forked it essentially and created their own video codec and they would actually render

47:14.940 --> 47:17.920
it as video and stream the video to the OnLive device.

47:17.920 --> 47:20.040
Which is what the shield does.

47:20.040 --> 47:21.040
Yeah, exactly.

47:21.040 --> 47:25.960
It takes it before it goes to the HDMI port on your graphics card, if I'm right.

47:25.960 --> 47:30.720
So if you can, if you can support, you know, a one to four megabit transfer rate over your

47:30.720 --> 47:35.280
home LAN, that's essentially all you need to be able to stream that video bit rate.

47:35.280 --> 47:39.080
Cause you're not actually streaming the raw data of the vectors and all of that.

47:39.080 --> 47:41.480
You're just streaming the end output video.

47:41.480 --> 47:42.480
Right.

47:42.480 --> 47:43.760
That's pretty much every network.

47:43.760 --> 47:44.760
Right.

47:44.760 --> 47:45.760
Yeah.

47:45.760 --> 47:49.200
It maybe is a little, a little pushing it for broadband connections for some folks,

47:49.200 --> 47:50.360
but I should work over that.

47:50.360 --> 47:53.120
I should work even over wifi.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.120
I would think so.

47:54.120 --> 47:55.120
Yeah.

47:55.120 --> 47:56.120
I would think so.

47:56.120 --> 47:59.440
They can probably drop the resolution to 720 without too many people noticing too.

47:59.440 --> 48:02.880
I think part of it that I'm reasonably, another reason why I'm kind of excited about it is

48:02.880 --> 48:05.520
because it's Gabe and it's valve, right?

48:05.520 --> 48:10.880
If this was EA or, you know, Activision, I don't know, some company saying they're going

48:10.880 --> 48:11.880
to make their own box.

48:11.880 --> 48:12.880
I'm like, okay, good.

48:12.880 --> 48:13.880
Well.

48:13.880 --> 48:17.160
I'll look forward to that bastardization hitting the market soon.

48:17.160 --> 48:21.360
Because valve has a, because valve has a good track record with their, with their comments.

48:21.360 --> 48:22.360
Well, yeah.

48:22.360 --> 48:27.720
I mean, just Gabe, you know, just totally we sort of, sort of, I mean, it makes so much

48:27.720 --> 48:28.720
sense with that.

48:28.720 --> 48:31.120
Why he was saying what he was saying at that keynote, it's, he's laying it all out there

48:31.120 --> 48:33.240
saying this is the rationale.

48:33.240 --> 48:36.920
And then when, when the news hits you, you know, you have this total framework to, to,

48:36.920 --> 48:37.920
to view it all.

48:37.920 --> 48:39.560
And I mean, it was pretty, pretty brilliant.

48:39.560 --> 48:40.560
It was good staging.

48:40.560 --> 48:43.400
I'm curious to see where it all goes.

48:43.400 --> 48:44.400
Yeah, I am too.

48:44.400 --> 48:46.320
And I think whoever did their marketing did a really nice job.

48:46.320 --> 48:49.200
I mean, it was presented in a way of, here's why I care.

48:49.200 --> 48:50.200
Love me a good countdown.

48:50.200 --> 48:51.200
Yeah, exactly.

48:51.200 --> 48:52.200
Right.

48:52.200 --> 48:53.200
It's excited.

48:53.200 --> 48:57.080
You know, one thing that I find.

48:57.080 --> 49:03.000
I think that at the end of the day, Valve should more or less focus on organizing themselves.

49:03.000 --> 49:08.240
Remember that they are just a platform in order to sell games, make sure that the development

49:08.240 --> 49:15.440
platform is good for the developers, probably get one or two blessed vendors for the hardware,

49:15.440 --> 49:20.720
but mainly focus on getting their stuff ported over to Linux so that the developers are easy

49:20.720 --> 49:25.920
to move, to make a transition across to, to Linux so that they can get their game sells.

49:25.920 --> 49:26.920
Right.

49:26.920 --> 49:27.920
Yeah.

49:27.920 --> 49:32.000
And if it is that they can do that, the hardware aspect of it will come eventually, whether

49:32.000 --> 49:38.120
people like it or not, they would still be able to get, whether it's System76 or Dell

49:38.120 --> 49:42.120
for that matter might want to jump on board because they see that, hey, everybody wants

49:42.120 --> 49:44.760
to play games on Steam and every, and Steam using Linux.

49:44.760 --> 49:49.000
So we need to, in order to get in on this, we have to be able to supply people with what

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
they want.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.240
Well, you have a, you have a, you're going to have a whole range of people who just want

49:52.240 --> 49:55.520
to play some of these side scrolling platformers or they just want to play some of these lower

49:55.520 --> 49:58.840
end games and they could just, and as long as they're happy with streaming too, if the

49:58.840 --> 50:03.920
streaming actually works, you could take, you could take an old box and just load the

50:03.920 --> 50:06.360
SteamOS on it and call it good.

50:06.360 --> 50:09.640
And you know, it doesn't matter if it can't play all the games natively because the streaming's

50:09.640 --> 50:10.640
there.

50:10.640 --> 50:12.040
And it could be this great use.

50:12.040 --> 50:16.500
And if they tie in kind of video media playback, like I'm talking local LAN playback, give

50:16.500 --> 50:20.360
me a little MKV support, maybe even a little Netflix action, action, I'm putting this on

50:20.360 --> 50:21.840
every TV in my house.

50:21.840 --> 50:22.840
Exactly.

50:22.840 --> 50:23.840
That's, I think that's kind of what they're aiming for.

50:23.840 --> 50:24.840
I really do.

50:24.840 --> 50:28.600
And I think by hitting, basically looking at what the other consoles did wrong and that's

50:28.600 --> 50:32.280
of course, you know, Wii is targeting nothing but family use only and any serious gamers

50:32.280 --> 50:33.920
laughing at it.

50:33.920 --> 50:38.440
Xbox and PS3 completely alienates most family folks and definitely into more of the people

50:38.440 --> 50:39.880
that really like to play games.

50:39.880 --> 50:43.960
I think by hitting that middle ground, and I think they can by having the side scrollers

50:43.960 --> 50:46.800
as well as the hardcore games, I think they're going to be able to hit all the nails in the

50:46.800 --> 50:47.800
head.

50:47.800 --> 50:50.020
Well, and I think too, you have to look at some of this stuff in the perspective of a

50:50.020 --> 50:54.960
struggling middle class, an economy that is continuing to have to make tough choices about

50:54.960 --> 50:56.640
what they spend their money on.

50:56.640 --> 51:01.640
And if I've got a two or three year old machine that can run SteamOS just fine, assuming I'm

51:01.640 --> 51:07.400
okay with streaming a portion of the high end games, then to me, it's almost a slam

51:07.400 --> 51:11.960
dunk because I get a console out of reinvesting in hardware I already have.

51:11.960 --> 51:14.020
That's always been a great sales pitch for Linux usage.

51:14.020 --> 51:18.060
It's always been a fantastic use for it and now, now we actually have a console contender

51:18.060 --> 51:21.960
and so Valve is throwing their hat into the console ring by not creating one console but

51:21.960 --> 51:25.720
by creating a platform and then letting the community build around it.

51:25.720 --> 51:27.360
I'm pretty excited about that.

51:27.360 --> 51:28.360
Makes complete sense.

51:28.360 --> 51:30.980
We're going to keep digging into this and as we get more information, maybe even get

51:30.980 --> 51:34.480
our hands on SteamOS, we'll talk about it more in the Linux action show, Matt.

51:34.480 --> 51:37.320
But I thought we should probably get to a couple of email items that came in.

51:37.320 --> 51:38.900
Yeah, good plan.

51:38.900 --> 51:41.800
And before we do that, I wanted to actually make a special mention.

51:41.800 --> 51:47.560
So I would talk about this pretty much as frequently as I feel people will tolerate

51:47.560 --> 51:50.620
and that is our affiliate system.

51:50.620 --> 51:52.920
We have links at the bottom of the Jupiter Broadcasting website.

51:52.920 --> 51:54.840
We also have Chrome and Firefox extensions.

51:54.840 --> 51:56.000
This is why I'm bringing it up.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.880
Ah, the topic of the day, yes.

51:57.880 --> 52:02.800
We did an update and I think it's really only Chrome that bit us in the butt but we did

52:02.800 --> 52:07.960
an update to both to support new sites and to also kind of handle the, properly handle

52:07.960 --> 52:10.960
the way when people click on an affiliated link on somebody else's site to make sure

52:10.960 --> 52:13.160
our link doesn't override it.

52:13.160 --> 52:17.600
That required a re, re, I don't even really, I don't really think it changes much except

52:17.600 --> 52:19.920
for the way it just reads the URLs.

52:19.920 --> 52:21.400
And anyways, that requires a reauthorization.

52:21.400 --> 52:24.760
We had a massive drop off, a huge, huge drop off.

52:24.760 --> 52:28.000
And I almost wonder if people are, it's maybe they are aware of it but they don't know if

52:28.000 --> 52:31.080
they already have the old one installed, like do they know how to go into extensions?

52:31.080 --> 52:32.080
It's super subtle.

52:32.080 --> 52:34.800
Yeah, you gotta hit like the little hamburger menu and then go down there and say re-enable.

52:34.800 --> 52:35.800
What's that look like?

52:35.800 --> 52:36.800
Maybe show us what a hamburger menu looks like.

52:36.800 --> 52:37.800
The three line.

52:37.800 --> 52:38.800
I don't have a shot of it.

52:38.800 --> 52:39.800
Oh, you don't have a shot?

52:39.800 --> 52:40.800
That's fine.

52:40.800 --> 52:41.800
So it's up there in the upper right hand corner.

52:41.800 --> 52:42.800
Yeah, exactly.

52:42.800 --> 52:43.800
It's that, it's that three dot, that three line.

52:43.800 --> 52:44.800
It's called, they call it the hamburger menu.

52:44.800 --> 52:45.800
And in there you reauthorize it.

52:45.800 --> 52:50.880
We had a huge drop off so our, our expenses are super tight when that goes away because

52:50.880 --> 52:55.000
the way we do it is we have advertising that pays for a certain running amount and then

52:55.000 --> 53:00.200
we have a good portion that comes from the affiliates and that sort of balances out where

53:00.200 --> 53:01.520
our different revenues come from.

53:01.520 --> 53:05.000
But if either one drops off significantly, it really hurts the production.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.640
So if you would check that and make sure it's enabled and if you don't already have our

53:07.640 --> 53:10.920
browser extension, well you can find a link to the bottom of Jupiter Broadcasting for

53:10.920 --> 53:14.900
Chrome or Firefox and we'd really appreciate it if you grab that and help us.

53:14.900 --> 53:21.280
We have huge plans for 2014 and I've been kind of discovering over the last couple of

53:21.280 --> 53:23.160
weeks, there's a lot of local listeners, Matt.

53:23.160 --> 53:24.480
Oh, oh, that reminds me.

53:24.480 --> 53:25.480
Oh, so, okay.

53:25.480 --> 53:28.200
So we have a lot of local listeners, which how cool would it be to do an unplugged with

53:28.200 --> 53:29.440
a few people in studio?

53:29.440 --> 53:31.720
Dude, that would be awesome, right?

53:31.720 --> 53:32.720
Yeah.

53:32.720 --> 53:33.720
Okay.

53:33.720 --> 53:36.000
So this is, I probably should have brought this up to you off air, but I'm going to

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
throw this out there.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
Okay.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.220
One of the things we could do in a future where everything is, everybody has infinite

53:42.220 --> 53:46.960
time and organization capabilities, you know, that future that we talk about all the time,

53:46.960 --> 53:51.800
wouldn't it be fun to take a Tuesday and like go do something on location, do an unplugged

53:51.800 --> 53:56.000
on location, and while we're doing that, record a segment for that Sunday's last, so sort

53:56.000 --> 53:57.920
of kill two birds with one stone.

53:57.920 --> 54:02.640
So we take a Tuesday, we do the unplugged show on location, maybe do like a meetup type

54:02.640 --> 54:06.900
thing, and then, you know, I'll give you an example.

54:06.900 --> 54:12.160
This was all while I was naked, I was in the shower, I think I had, I probably had soaked

54:12.160 --> 54:15.800
my body, but I don't think I had put any shampoo on yet, so just that's about that stage in

54:15.800 --> 54:16.800
the shower.

54:16.800 --> 54:19.040
And why do I picture you with microphone in hand this entire time?

54:19.040 --> 54:20.040
I don't know.

54:20.040 --> 54:21.040
Yeah, well definitely.

54:21.040 --> 54:23.960
I got a waterproof microphone, yeah, yeah.

54:23.960 --> 54:29.200
And so I was thinking it'd be really cool if like, the scenario I came up with was a

54:29.200 --> 54:33.360
beer tourie, because we, you know, we met folks that run their breweries on Linux.

54:33.360 --> 54:39.880
I was thinking real world, local Washington implementations of Linux in their work environment,

54:39.880 --> 54:43.640
something you know, not so much like, here's our Samba server, I mean that's cool, I mean

54:43.640 --> 54:46.000
good on ya, but we can't really make a segment out of that.

54:46.000 --> 54:50.280
But like if you got like a brewery running Linux or a farm running Linux, oh dude a farm

54:50.280 --> 54:51.680
would be awesome.

54:51.680 --> 54:55.000
Anything running Linux that we could go look at and shoot a segment for for last, I'd love

54:55.000 --> 54:58.160
to do some on location stuff for last, just kind of kick things up a notch.

54:58.160 --> 55:01.960
And then we would do like a meetup somewhere around there, and then that's when we do unplugged.

55:01.960 --> 55:05.700
So we'd be like killing like, basically we take a Tuesday and just knock out unplugged

55:05.700 --> 55:08.080
and a segment for last and just have a ton of fun.

55:08.080 --> 55:09.080
I like that idea.

55:09.080 --> 55:10.800
I think, I don't see any reason why we couldn't.

55:10.800 --> 55:15.160
It's an example of some of the things I want to do, and there's some ways I want to facilitate

55:15.160 --> 55:19.480
that, and I have some great ideas for 2014, but we really need folks' support, so if you

55:19.480 --> 55:23.520
please click those affiliate links and grab those browser extensions, it helps us plan

55:23.520 --> 55:24.520
for that kind of stuff.

55:24.520 --> 55:25.520
Absolutely.

55:25.520 --> 55:28.680
Otherwise we're going to have to start doing like a, you know, save the children PSAs and

55:28.680 --> 55:29.680
stuff.

55:29.680 --> 55:32.880
Today on Unplugged, instead of doing a show, we're just doing a pledge drive.

55:32.880 --> 55:33.880
Seriously, yeah.

55:33.880 --> 55:37.060
Just, we're just going to keep talking, we'll keep talking, you know what we'll do is we'd

55:37.060 --> 55:41.120
talk about iPhones until people pledged, and then when people pledged, we could talk about

55:41.120 --> 55:44.640
Linux, and then once the like timer had run out, we'd have to go back to iPhones.

55:44.640 --> 55:46.080
Basically a torture technique.

55:46.080 --> 55:49.440
Or it has us like rummaging around various dumpsters looking for food because you guys

55:49.440 --> 55:51.120
aren't supporting us with our, yeah, I mean.

55:51.120 --> 55:56.880
Yeah, we take last and convert it into a dumpster diving, dumpster diving action show.

55:56.880 --> 55:57.880
Okay.

55:57.880 --> 55:58.880
Hey, this could run Linux.

55:58.880 --> 55:59.880
He sees out of the dumpster, right?

55:59.880 --> 56:00.880
Oh my gosh.

56:00.880 --> 56:01.880
Okay.

56:01.880 --> 56:02.880
So it's up to you fellas.

56:02.880 --> 56:03.880
We'll see.

56:03.880 --> 56:04.880
We'll see what happens.

56:04.880 --> 56:05.880
We'll see where it shakes out, man.

56:05.880 --> 56:06.880
All right.

56:06.880 --> 56:11.000
So I've been an Arch user for over a year now and I, and it's basically because of the

56:11.000 --> 56:14.280
awesomeness of make package and make and PKG.

56:14.280 --> 56:18.000
The problem I'm having is that I can't find a desktop environment I like.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.000
Here's why.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.000
I'm a typical user.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.000
I'm not a typical user.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
I don't think.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.760
I spend 99% of my day jumping between terminal and web browser.

56:25.760 --> 56:27.400
I don't like messing with my desktop.

56:27.400 --> 56:30.720
I want to look decent, but basically out of the box and get out of the way.

56:30.720 --> 56:34.600
I'm using Cinnamon right now, but I've tried elementary OS after your review and I really

56:34.600 --> 56:35.760
like Pantheon.

56:35.760 --> 56:40.000
Based on this, I'm leaning towards installing elementary and running Arch in a VM.

56:40.000 --> 56:43.360
That said, he says, cause he maintains a couple of packages in the AUR.

56:43.360 --> 56:44.480
Good on you, Matthew.

56:44.480 --> 56:48.440
He said, that said, there are still some apps I require the latest versions of like Gex

56:48.440 --> 56:50.680
and get, I'm sorry, and Tmux.

56:50.680 --> 56:54.920
So I'm planning on just compiling the latest versions of those myself on site like elementary.

56:54.920 --> 56:58.120
I realized this may not work for everyone, but the, for the dev ops, for dev ops, sys

56:58.120 --> 57:04.020
admins like myself, who don't like to waste time tweaking the desktop, it's becoming the

57:04.020 --> 57:05.020
ideal solution.

57:05.020 --> 57:08.040
I mean, I think we kind of zeroed in and that's who elementary OS would be good for.

57:08.040 --> 57:12.920
The part I don't agree with is, I mean, it sounds like maybe he needs like, you know,

57:12.920 --> 57:14.760
Exmonad or awesome window manager.

57:14.760 --> 57:15.760
I mean, it kind of does.

57:15.760 --> 57:16.760
Yeah.

57:16.760 --> 57:17.960
And that might be something for him to explore as well.

57:17.960 --> 57:21.320
And I'd also chime in on the whole Arch in a VM, just do yourself a favor and do a separate

57:21.320 --> 57:22.320
partition.

57:22.320 --> 57:23.320
Honestly, you'll be so much happier.

57:23.320 --> 57:25.560
Especially when you're doing from the AUR, you need to build, right?

57:25.560 --> 57:30.000
I just, I have building in a VM is like, Oh, and just Arch in a VM in general, just getting

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
it set up.

57:31.000 --> 57:34.840
It's actually massively simpler on a partition than it is in a VM.

57:34.840 --> 57:35.840
Is it based on my experience?

57:35.840 --> 57:42.400
LXDE, we've got a recommendation from Ick in the chat room that LXDE would be good.

57:42.400 --> 57:48.280
I guess, I think that, I think that really I'm still, so I switched back to Gnome for

57:48.280 --> 57:53.360
a couple of hours this week and decided to go back to KDE because KDE is, yeah, you know,

57:53.360 --> 57:56.920
with all the extensions, I had, I had extension problems again and I just felt like, you know,

57:56.920 --> 57:58.760
with KDE I can make it be what I want.

57:58.760 --> 58:01.260
And even if it takes a little bit of tweaking.

58:01.260 --> 58:07.080
So I think, I honestly think, I do see how the, maybe try to just experiment with getting

58:07.080 --> 58:08.640
the Pantheon desktop running under Arch.

58:08.640 --> 58:11.040
I know there's people out there working on that and see if that gets you where you want.

58:11.040 --> 58:12.320
Then try out elementary OS.

58:12.320 --> 58:13.320
Sure.

58:13.320 --> 58:14.320
All right.

58:14.320 --> 58:15.320
Jonathan writes in regarding windows.

58:15.320 --> 58:18.000
I'm not sure where this fits, but I just wanted to send it to you guys.

58:18.000 --> 58:21.600
I'm more or less left on windows in the windows world.

58:21.600 --> 58:23.240
And I've been stuck in the XP era.

58:23.240 --> 58:26.920
Every time I had to take a quick trip into the Microsoft pool, it left me with shivers,

58:26.920 --> 58:30.340
viruses, stupid gooey's and infinite reboot bonanzas.

58:30.340 --> 58:32.560
And he's come to an epiphany.

58:32.560 --> 58:36.260
He said, I think I finally understand why windows has ruled the enterprise desktops

58:36.260 --> 58:39.740
for so long, despite all of the shortcomings he just listed.

58:39.740 --> 58:46.000
He says, I'm interning at a large IT company, which means someone else does all the rebooting

58:46.000 --> 58:47.520
virus scans and whatnot.

58:47.520 --> 58:50.040
In that setting, windows is very usable.

58:50.040 --> 58:51.880
Only the bad UI is left to deal with.

58:51.880 --> 58:52.880
And of course, IE.

58:52.880 --> 58:56.920
And he's got a great point because in enterprise, IT pulls their hair out with all the problems

58:56.920 --> 58:57.920
windows has.

58:57.920 --> 59:00.920
And then the end users all la dee da dee da circus music's going on in their head.

59:00.920 --> 59:01.920
They don't have a clue.

59:01.920 --> 59:06.000
You know, early on was one of the motivations to getting windows out of my home is I, you

59:06.000 --> 59:08.800
know, I, uh, I can't, I can't remember what OS Andrew's on.

59:08.800 --> 59:14.640
I mean, this is probably windows 2000 before I switched her to, uh, open SUSE and KDE.

59:14.640 --> 59:17.640
And I just, you know, I come home and she'd have windows problems, printing problems.

59:17.640 --> 59:20.600
And I was just like, oh yeah, no, I don't want any more of this.

59:20.600 --> 59:24.120
And for me, it was like, I was literally, I I'd already been running Linux for some

59:24.120 --> 59:27.800
time, but I went exclusive Linux when I found out that I think it was a win FS.

59:27.800 --> 59:30.240
You know, I was looking forward to that file system with all the neat features they're

59:30.240 --> 59:31.420
babbling about.

59:31.420 --> 59:32.880
That wasn't going to happen.

59:32.880 --> 59:35.400
I'm like, that's it.

59:35.400 --> 59:37.960
If I hear the word NTFS one more time, I'm going to shoot something.

59:37.960 --> 59:38.960
I just, I couldn't handle it.

59:38.960 --> 59:41.440
He also, uh, he needs some advice from you, Matt.

59:41.440 --> 59:46.600
He says, I've been forced, uh, through this company to use internet Explorer exclusively.

59:46.600 --> 59:50.100
I'm in need of some therapeutic tips to get that dirty feeling off me when the workday

59:50.100 --> 59:51.100
is over.

59:51.100 --> 59:52.100
Any advice?

59:52.100 --> 59:53.240
Uh, kill it with fire.

59:53.240 --> 59:55.080
Um, that's the first I actually burn.

59:55.080 --> 59:59.800
Yeah, like get, try and find like an old IE five CD, you know, they used to come in packages,

59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.800
get some of those, light them on fire, do a barbecue.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.800
You know, that could help.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.160
You know, I don't know, man.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.160
That's, that's tough.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:09.880
Spend some quality time with candlelit, candlelit Mozilla, you know, just kind of get it around

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:14.000
your monitor, get some, uh, Barry White going, you know, what I would do honestly too is

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.600
like sometimes you need to like relive how bad it used to be in IE land.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.360
So like go like find a VM of like windows 98 with like three or something and then live

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:25.320
that for a day and then be like, wow, this new IE is great.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.320
Great.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.920
And it's not, that's the horrible part.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:32.480
Uh, Kiwi in the chat room says that, uh, he could just drink heavily.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.480
That could also.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.480
Yeah, that works.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.480
Yeah.

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.480
And the beer goggles in IE is looking pretty good.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.480
Yeah.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.480
There you go.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.920
Uh, so we, we had an email that came in from Ritison, who is a Manjaro Linux user and he

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:46.360
wanted to talk about SteamOS versus Ubuntu Edge.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:50.200
I started to get through it and he, you know, I was going to read it cause he says blast

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.760
is my favorite podcast of all time.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.760
He looks forward to it every week.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.280
And I thought, well, okay, I got to read this guy.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.280
Strong.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.280
Yeah.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.280
Right.

01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.280
But it's very long.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.840
Uh, but what he says is he thinks it's an interesting correlation to look at sort of the, um, big

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.880
run up to Ubuntu Edge and then the court of immediate drop off where his valve is sort

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:10.800
of taken this different approach where they've started, um, very small, you know, make this

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.800
work better.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:16.180
Uh, like Gabe called it the sweater, um, the sweater approach where they pull us one thread

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:19.320
and then just leads to the next red means the next thread and they've been making those

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:22.260
things better, whereas canonical is kind of like put everything out there, let's go, let's

01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.260
do this by it.

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:24.440
We don't even have all the bits done yet.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.340
Not all the infrastructure done yet, but if you, if you commit to this week, we can try,

01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:28.720
we can get, try to get it done.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:33.920
Uh, he says that he feels like, uh, that it requires large companies like valve who have

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.960
deep pockets to make this possible.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.720
He says, I look forward to the crazy future of Linux, but I resent that it does take these

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:43.160
huge companies like Google and valve, you know, of course, Google with Android to push

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.160
her forward to public adoption sometimes.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.880
However, I feel like Gabe understands that and respects the philosophy of open source

01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:49.880
more than others.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:55.480
And I actually use the word Linux on the steam OS announcement page, unlike certain popular

01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:00.120
distro that makes no mention of Linux anywhere on their website or mobile OS, uh, I truly

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:05.880
feel steam OS is pure Linux's chance to gain market share and a user base.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:09.920
It deserves, even if users are unaware that they're running it, which considering the

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:14.120
state of some computer users, knowledge comes to as no surprise, sorry for being so long,

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.280
but I'm really excited and keep up the great work.

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:23.040
A managerial user and you know, he's right, this could be, um, this could be like, uh,

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.040
this could, I don't know, I don't, I don't want to be too crazy, but you know, if you

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:31.840
look over history, the common platform eventually takes over.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:36.760
Like you start with individual things like very purpose-built operating systems, very

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:40.280
purpose-built devices that really only do one thing.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:45.280
And then as, as the general technology advances and becomes more powerful, uh, it just becomes

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:49.800
economically more viable to use that technology and to continue to create your own technology

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:54.280
every single time, uh, all, uh, you know, these individual platforms that we have now.

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.900
So it kind of, you know, I've always kind of seen a day and age where, um, these big

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:02.160
guys move on, Microsoft moves on, Apple moves on.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:06.200
And what we're left with is a really healthy Linux ecosystem because Linux has kind of

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:07.200
taken over there.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.200
Linux kind of moves into mobile, Linux moves into the living room, Linux moves into the

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:13.880
desktop and over time it's on the server, it's on the cloud, it's on the work, you know,

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:19.120
it's everywhere because as people leave that area or the, or the common generally available

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.760
platform becomes good enough, it just becomes almost crazy not to use it.

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:29.440
And uh, steam could be, steamOS could be the beginning of that takeover, not just from

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:34.360
a Tivo standpoint, but from a really large scale deployment standpoint of, of an ecosystem

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:38.000
where people are actually making money, people are actually developing and creating something

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.600
of extreme value.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.120
And I'm, I'm really, really, really excited that it's Valve doing it and I'm, I'm really

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.880
interested to see the kind of opportunities we're going to have in last to cover this

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:50.320
because there's tons of potential for them to screw this thing up royally.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.320
Oh yes, yes there is.

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.320
Right?

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.560
And we're going to be there to watch that happen if that does happen, but there's also

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:57.600
opportunities for like, what's the best way to build out a steam rig?

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.000
What's the cheapest steam rig you can buy?

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.920
What's the nicest steam rig you can build?

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.840
You know, it's endless possibilities, endless possibilities.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:08.280
And then just watching adoption as well, because as we all know, uh, computers are nothing

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.520
more than how do I accomplish blank?

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:15.080
We really, most people don't really pay a lot of attention to what the OS is.

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.240
It's how do I do this?

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.240
How do I do that?

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.240
How do I Skype?

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.240
How do I browse the web?

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.240
How do I send an email?

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.240
How do I game?

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.240
And Valve is going to be sending the game.

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:29.540
And what I like about that is it's totally solving that problem at the same time.

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:33.240
Like you could be completely checked out of the whole steam ecosystem.

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:34.300
You could never buy a title.

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.960
You can never use steam OS.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.720
You're still getting better kernel X.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.160
You're still getting better Nvidia Y.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:43.240
You're still getting all of these improvements that they're making that are going to hit

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.560
the rest of general Linux.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:49.560
And that to me is also sort of like this everybody wins scenario here.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.560
If it's successful.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.560
Right?

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.560
I think it will be.

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:55.960
I think, and I think the advantage they have is that they don't have the pressures that

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.920
say Apple or Microsoft have from shareholders.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:02.600
Now that's not, I don't know what steam, I don't know what Valve's exact corporate structure

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.600
is.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.760
Last time I checked, I think they're privately held, which is if they are to stay that way,

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:09.880
you'll be happier because it's less headaches and you can go long game.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.560
If once you go, once you go public, you're short game.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.920
And so that limits your options.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.360
So yes, I think in the long run they will be successful.

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.400
It may not happen all at once and may, they may have some bumps in the road.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.720
They may even have some costly mistakes, but I think because they're taking that sweater

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.000
approach, it's going to work out for them.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Yeah.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Cause they're doing all of the really, you know, low level grunt work that has to be

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.520
done first and not just building the flashy presentation on top of all of that first.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:37.120
Like they're doing the stuff that, you know, general consumers will never, ever, ever give

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.400
them credit for.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:39.720
It's not sexy.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:43.360
It's not going to win them over in, you know, the, in the general consumer markets.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.680
Only the stuff that us Linux nerds care about, but it shows that they're taking the right

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:47.680
approach.

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.240
And here's something they won't do that Google did.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:53.320
We've talked about how Android basically sold their souls to get themselves on various mobile,

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.280
with various mobile carriers and various phones.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:59.400
And of course the carriers or the phones themselves would be bastardized with all the software

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:00.400
and stuff.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.400
Valve won't do that.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.040
The Valve stuff will remain here.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:07.040
I believe that through and through that anyone they hook up with, they're not going, you're

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:11.160
not going to see lots of, Hey, get this new, you know, lots of the little icons appearing

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.160
all over your screen or any of that.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.160
It's going to be great.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.160
It's going to be really solid.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.240
Wouldn't it be interesting to like, if Roku eventually rolled out a steam box, cause if

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:21.320
they can take the platform and they just have to put up, you know, you could have the Roku

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:26.360
maybe in three years, the Roku XL is got a, you know, a really good graphics processor

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:30.480
in it and it has the steam, steam OS on it or something like that.

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.480
I think so.

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:35.120
Well, and just to look historically at Roku and I'm probably partially correct on this

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:39.240
and I think I am, if I remember correctly, the guys behind Roku are actually the guys

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.920
behind replay TV.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:42.920
These guys know what they're doing.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:44.200
And Roku is Linux based already.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.440
Yeah, it is Linux based and they, and they got it right.

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:50.760
So I think that, yeah, if they did hook up with Roku, that would be very wise of them.

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.760
Anybody could.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.080
I mean, you could just take, I mean, if the boxy box was to come around, say that, you

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.920
know, we, the boxy box guys time traveled to the future and created their product.

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:01.880
Why not base boxy box on the steam box and if you could, you know, maybe if there's a

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.640
way to do video and all that kind of stuff, because sure, then you just get the advantage

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:05.640
of the steam library.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:08.640
It's like, it's, it's like when you ship an Android tablet, you want to be able to put

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:09.640
the play store on there.

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.640
It's bingo.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.640
Exactly.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.640
All right, Matt.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.080
Well, I think that'll wrap us up for this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:19.080

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:27.800
Join us on Sunday.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:30.600
We've got a good show planned, Matt's going to help you secure your house with cameras

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.600
and Linux.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.600
Oh yes.

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:36.200
On Sunday and we will be doing some more steamOS coverage and following that as well.

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.200
We'd love to hear from you.

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.480
You can also join us live on Tuesdays over at jblive.tv.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.480
We kick that off at 2 p.m.

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.480
Pacific.

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.000
Hey, by the way, calendar page has been updated.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.640
You can now select your time zone on the freaking calendar page.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:47.640
Pow.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.640
Makes it super easy.

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.840
Anywhere in the world, not just US.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:50.840
That's right.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:51.840
Hey Matt, have a great week.

01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:52.840
I'll see you on Sunday.

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:53.840
Sounds good.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:54.840
See you then.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:55.840
All right, everyone.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.840
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:57.960
We'll be back here next week.
