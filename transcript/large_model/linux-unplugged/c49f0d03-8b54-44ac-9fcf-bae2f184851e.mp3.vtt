WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
It's been a while since we've done a Kickstarter

00:02.280 --> 00:03.800
on the show here.

00:03.800 --> 00:07.640
This is AI War 2, it has 696 backers.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.960
They're going for quite a bit of money.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.000
Yeah, they're only 10%.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.840
Yeah, they're going for like $300,000

00:12.840 --> 00:14.200
and they've only got 29K,

00:14.200 --> 00:16.080
but they still have 29 days to go.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.440
I wasn't so sure about this one.

00:18.440 --> 00:20.860
And then I watched the video and I think I'm all in.

00:20.860 --> 00:24.160
Plus also day one Linux support, they claim,

00:24.160 --> 00:25.600
which I'm a big fan of, so check this out.

00:25.600 --> 00:29.080
Okay, when did you last feel proud of winning a game?

00:29.080 --> 00:31.120
AI War can be that game.

00:31.120 --> 00:34.240
Your fleets are surrounded deep in enemy territory.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.980
Come out of nowhere, strike,

00:35.980 --> 00:38.360
and then disappear back to your own planet.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.680
But do not get cocky.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.240
Look, you're trying not to be noticed

00:42.240 --> 00:46.080
and an easy target isn't always a smart target.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.260
The AI essentially plays a board game like RISC.

00:49.260 --> 00:51.440
You're playing a grand strategic RTS.

00:51.440 --> 00:52.280
I love it.

00:52.280 --> 00:55.120
If the AI ever decides you're a big enough threat,

00:55.120 --> 00:56.080
you're dead.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.600
So you basically lay low.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.440
You lay low.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.840
Wait, the first AI War?

01:00.840 --> 01:02.720
Well, you already know all that.

01:02.720 --> 01:03.880
So what's new?

01:03.880 --> 01:05.560
Well, there's better performance,

01:05.560 --> 01:07.760
better networking, better multi-threading.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.360
We're adding modability.

01:09.360 --> 01:11.920
The graphics are better and they're in 3D.

01:11.920 --> 01:14.000
And they actually perform better.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.720
We're cleaning up the UI

01:15.720 --> 01:18.440
and making sure that you can tweak or mod it.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.000
We've even added technologies

01:20.000 --> 01:22.240
that let you customize your ships.

01:22.240 --> 01:24.740
The sense of scale is much larger.

01:24.740 --> 01:27.920
Isolated planets, well, they've now become solar systems.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.320
Lonely units, well, they're now squads.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.280
This thing is pretty neat.

01:31.280 --> 01:33.040
They just took everything up to 11.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.640
And something tells me that crowdfunding

01:35.640 --> 01:38.240
may be a bigger topic in today's episode

01:38.240 --> 01:39.720
of The Unplugged Show.

01:39.720 --> 01:42.440
So with that, let's get started.

01:42.440 --> 01:45.200
This is Linux Unplugged episode 166

01:45.200 --> 01:48.520
for October 11th, 2016.

01:48.520 --> 02:00.760
Welcome to Linux Unplugged,

02:00.760 --> 02:02.440
your weekly Linux talk show

02:02.440 --> 02:04.320
that's feeling a little negative

02:04.320 --> 02:05.680
in the freedom dimension.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.640
My name is Chris.

02:06.640 --> 02:07.480
My name is Wes.

02:07.480 --> 02:08.320
Hello, Mr. Wes.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.160
Hello.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.120
This is negative.

02:10.120 --> 02:12.360
We have a great show today.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.360
There's gonna be a theme that you might notice

02:14.360 --> 02:15.400
that'll just sort of pop up

02:15.400 --> 02:16.840
as we roll through. Look what we did.

02:16.840 --> 02:20.360
And of course, we've got our open source project update,

02:20.360 --> 02:21.300
some big news.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.480
I'm really excited to talk to some of our old friends

02:23.480 --> 02:26.320
to cover a few big accomplishments.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.880
There is a Whalen story tucked in here

02:28.880 --> 02:29.840
that I'm excited about.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.360
But also, let's get real.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.640
Will you get real with me for a moment?

02:33.640 --> 02:34.480
Can we get real? I'll try.

02:34.480 --> 02:35.320
Let's do it.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.840
We're gonna have to talk about Mate.

02:38.040 --> 02:38.920
Things are changing here.

02:38.920 --> 02:40.820
Things are going big.

02:41.880 --> 02:42.720
Big league.

02:42.720 --> 02:43.540
Momentum.

02:43.540 --> 02:44.380
Huge.

02:44.380 --> 02:46.080
I think there's actually a legitimate transition,

02:46.080 --> 02:47.240
not to just joke around about it,

02:47.240 --> 02:48.320
but I think there's actually

02:48.320 --> 02:49.520
something massive happening here.

02:49.520 --> 02:50.920
I wanna talk about it today.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.120
Also, later on in the show,

02:53.120 --> 02:54.520
we're gonna run some interviews

02:54.520 --> 02:56.400
with an individual named Andy.

02:56.400 --> 02:59.720
And Andy will talk about how his company

02:59.720 --> 03:04.400
generates new leads by fixing bugs in open source.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.980
So they submit bug patches,

03:05.980 --> 03:08.360
they see their names on that bug patch,

03:08.360 --> 03:09.480
and oh, I gotta work with that company,

03:09.480 --> 03:10.920
and they end up getting consulting business.

03:10.920 --> 03:13.200
It's a new way to make money with open source

03:13.200 --> 03:14.480
that's a lot like the old way,

03:14.480 --> 03:17.360
with a few tweaks, using large-scale projects.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.600
We'll talk about it in today's Unplugged.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.320
So there will be a lot to cover.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.080
But before we go any further,

03:23.080 --> 03:26.180
it is our duty to bring in that virtual log,

03:26.180 --> 03:28.300
time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

03:28.300 --> 03:29.140
Happy Christmas.

03:29.140 --> 03:29.960
Greetings, Mumble Room.

03:29.960 --> 03:30.800
Hey, Mumble Room.

03:30.800 --> 03:31.640
Hello.

03:31.640 --> 03:32.480
Happy Christmas.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.300
Hey!

03:33.300 --> 03:34.140
Yes, hello, everybody.

03:34.140 --> 03:36.400
And some of them are joining us in a beer,

03:36.400 --> 03:38.800
and we are drinking today vanilla cream.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.260
Lights out.

03:40.260 --> 03:41.760
An extra stout.

03:41.760 --> 03:42.600
This is a hell of a beer, Wes.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.140
It is a little bit extra.

03:44.140 --> 03:44.980
It is a little extra.

03:44.980 --> 03:46.200
I have these 7.7%.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.280
And you know, that vanilla cream makes it nice and smooth.

03:48.280 --> 03:49.800
So it's really a very drinkable beer.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.440
Mr. Pope, you'll be drinking a Christmas beer,

03:51.440 --> 03:53.440
and we'll be drinking a vanilla cream.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.640
Let me just have another one.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.320
From Bend, Oregon, too.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.160
So it's another.

03:57.160 --> 03:58.000
Just our neighbors in the South.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.480
You have yet to bring,

04:00.480 --> 04:02.520
you've only brought local beer so far.

04:02.520 --> 04:04.520
I think there was one exception that was in Wyoming.

04:04.520 --> 04:05.360
Oh, really?

04:05.360 --> 04:07.240
There's that Melvin, which was very good.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.080
I like Wyoming, so we'll allow it.

04:09.080 --> 04:09.920
We'll let that slide, yeah.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.180
We will allow it, yeah.

04:11.180 --> 04:12.880
There is much to cover today,

04:12.880 --> 04:14.960
and I wanna start with one of the interesting updates.

04:14.960 --> 04:18.160
And it really required a huge investment

04:18.160 --> 04:19.600
here on the Unplugged program.

04:19.600 --> 04:23.120
We had to put in a lot of extra wiring,

04:23.120 --> 04:24.360
additional conduit.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.200
It's a mess.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.080
And unfortunately, if everything works as planned,

04:28.080 --> 04:31.040
the next few moments of the show may be absolutely silent,

04:31.040 --> 04:32.560
but it's imperative that we get an update

04:32.560 --> 04:33.400
from a friend of the show,

04:33.400 --> 04:35.380
so we're gonna introduce a new feature,

04:35.380 --> 04:36.220
the cone of silence.

04:36.220 --> 04:37.440
The cone of silence.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.260
Ooh.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.640
Come on, Mr. Ike, step into the cone here.

04:42.640 --> 04:43.480
How do you do?

04:43.480 --> 04:44.300
Hello, sir.

04:44.300 --> 04:45.140
Welcome back to the show.

04:45.140 --> 04:46.840
It's been a little while.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.960
It has indeed, and I apologize in advance,

04:48.960 --> 04:50.920
but my voice is almost completely gone.

04:50.920 --> 04:51.880
Yeah, it's kind of adorable.

04:51.880 --> 04:52.700
We'll forgive you.

04:52.700 --> 04:53.820
You're kind of adorable like that.

04:53.820 --> 04:56.240
So I constructed this cone of silence.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.260
I don't think any, it's just us.

04:57.260 --> 04:58.540
Nobody can hear us in here.

04:58.540 --> 05:01.400
And I wanted to get a little update

05:01.400 --> 05:03.980
on what you guys are doing over on the Soulless Project.

05:03.980 --> 05:07.920
I noticed some back and forth on Twitter about the Patreon,

05:07.920 --> 05:09.840
and I noticed some back and forth about ISOs.

05:09.840 --> 05:10.960
What's going on over there,

05:10.960 --> 05:14.400
and what secrets do you want to just share between you and I?

05:14.400 --> 05:16.680
So this is what we agreed on Twitter earlier on,

05:16.680 --> 05:19.840
like nobody else can hear us, and this is not recorded.

05:19.840 --> 05:20.660
Did you not hear?

05:20.660 --> 05:21.500
I have the cone of silence.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.320
It's the cone of silence.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.160
This is a private, personal moment.

05:23.160 --> 05:24.000
Just us three.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.480
It's completely confidential.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.320
There's three of us now.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.140
Okay.

05:27.140 --> 05:27.980
Oh, yeah.

05:27.980 --> 05:28.820
I snuck in under the coat.

05:28.820 --> 05:30.680
And I think Josh might have gotten a key, too.

05:30.680 --> 05:31.640
Right, I think so.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.040
Yeah, but.

05:33.040 --> 05:36.040
Okay, so the room's getting bigger, but okay.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.760
Either way, it's totally private.

05:37.760 --> 05:40.760
Recently, we've been building up to the 1.2.1 release,

05:40.760 --> 05:42.520
and I know for a lot of people by now,

05:42.520 --> 05:44.800
they're probably thinking 1.2.1

05:44.800 --> 05:48.560
has got to be phantomware by now, but it is happening,

05:48.560 --> 05:51.520
and now we're got into the last 10%,

05:51.520 --> 05:54.240
and the last 10% is always the hardest.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.400
That 90% before, you know, you race through that.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.440
You're generating news all the time.

05:58.440 --> 06:02.400
So the most recent news for us over the last few days,

06:02.400 --> 06:03.560
mainly last night, actually,

06:03.560 --> 06:07.760
I finished up LVM2, an encryption support and installer,

06:07.760 --> 06:09.740
which is something that people have been requesting

06:09.740 --> 06:11.120
for a long time.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.600
So now in the Solus installer,

06:12.600 --> 06:15.480
we can do full disk encryption automatically for them.

06:15.480 --> 06:16.800
Oh, that's great.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.840
Yeah, which is like LVM2 on top of looks.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.200
It's very, very simple.

06:20.200 --> 06:21.920
They can choose to use LVM2,

06:21.920 --> 06:25.040
and then they can choose to additionally encrypt it as well.

06:25.040 --> 06:25.880
That's awesome.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.720
So that literally landed just last night,

06:27.720 --> 06:31.000
and about five or six o'clock this morning,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.200
I actually finished the encryption support.

06:33.200 --> 06:36.040
So it was a bit of a late night.

06:36.040 --> 06:39.240
And while you're sick, nonetheless, too.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.280
Yeah, I mean, it was easier to do that

06:41.280 --> 06:43.800
than to deal with being sick, to be honest with you.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.280
Boy, isn't that the truth.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.960
How are you feeling like the crowdfunding's going

06:47.960 --> 06:48.800
in Patreon?

06:48.800 --> 06:50.060
You know, it's something we've been talking about here

06:50.060 --> 06:51.560
behind the scenes a lot.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.760
And I've been more and more worried

06:53.760 --> 06:57.480
that it might not be the right platform for a large project,

06:57.480 --> 07:00.080
even, you know, a project that wants to become large one day.

07:00.080 --> 07:01.760
What are your experiences so far?

07:02.640 --> 07:04.240
Well, I think I'm gonna have to agree with you there.

07:04.240 --> 07:07.080
I mean, we've had Patreon for a long while.

07:07.080 --> 07:10.880
At the moment, I think it's hovering just over 550 bucks

07:10.880 --> 07:12.280
a month or something.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.160
Now, that's been running up for a few months.

07:14.160 --> 07:17.080
So basically, I didn't take anything out from it

07:17.080 --> 07:19.600
for about five or six months now,

07:19.600 --> 07:22.680
just to let it build up, you know, like a rainy day fund.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.720
And at the moment, there's like 2,500 in there.

07:25.720 --> 07:28.400
So you can kind of see the picture

07:28.400 --> 07:30.800
that it does fluctuate quite a lot.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.840
And, you know, it gets to the end of the month,

07:32.840 --> 07:37.280
and then suddenly 15, 20 pledges have gone.

07:37.280 --> 07:39.560
So it's not a reliable source of income at all.

07:39.560 --> 07:44.600
And 550 or whatever it is at the moment,

07:44.600 --> 07:47.240
it's not gonna cut it, you know, yourself.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.600
So, I mean, it's been funded out in my own pocket now

07:49.600 --> 07:50.560
for a very long time.

07:50.560 --> 07:54.840
So that's servers, that's even my electric for,

07:54.840 --> 07:57.520
you know, I'm running like a big Xeon server

07:57.520 --> 07:59.600
under my desk here as well.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.800
We got several servers, we got the websites, SSL certificates.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.760
And then there's the hardware as well.

08:04.760 --> 08:07.360
So by no means does it cover it,

08:07.360 --> 08:10.280
but it's kind of one of those ones with Solus.

08:10.280 --> 08:13.760
We never set out to be financially successful.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.960
It's just, well, there was a comment on Twitter

08:15.960 --> 08:17.480
earlier on because I was very surprised,

08:17.480 --> 08:22.080
but oh my God, Ubuntu actually put a post up asking

08:22.080 --> 08:25.440
about the future of Linux desktop and was it Solus?

08:25.440 --> 08:28.800
Which was a bit of a jaw hit the floor moment.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.680
It's like, that's all my God, Ubuntu.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.720
But then someone said, they put it there very well,

08:33.720 --> 08:35.480
is that Solus is now mainstream.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.280
It's like, you're kind of right.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.800
It's not like Solus was a year ago

08:39.800 --> 08:42.040
where nobody knew what it was.

08:42.040 --> 08:43.800
You know, everyone kind of knows what Solus is now.

08:43.800 --> 08:44.760
They've all heard about it.

08:44.760 --> 08:47.520
So it's one of the more mainstream Linux distributions.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.400
Everyone knows it's for the desktop.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.240
It's always-

08:50.240 --> 08:51.600
It sure has happened fast though.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.440
Yeah, I mean, a lot faster than we intended it to,

08:54.440 --> 08:55.960
to be honest with you.

08:55.960 --> 08:58.760
So that's why we have to add things now.

08:58.760 --> 09:03.760
Is there, I guess, do you want to just do a plug

09:04.960 --> 09:07.000
for the Patreon right here, since we just mentioned it,

09:07.000 --> 09:08.560
since we might as well if people are curious

09:08.560 --> 09:10.480
about the project, where do they go?

09:10.480 --> 09:12.880
Yeah, I mean, if people go to patreon.com forward slash

09:12.880 --> 09:16.120
solus, then you can support one of us poor little devs,

09:16.120 --> 09:18.000
you know, like we get locked in the cage

09:18.000 --> 09:19.880
and we get abused thoroughly.

09:19.880 --> 09:22.400
So just a few dollars a month and you'll help us

09:22.400 --> 09:23.960
to keep the lights on.

09:23.960 --> 09:24.840
Yeah, all right.

09:24.840 --> 09:25.680
I relinquished-

09:25.680 --> 09:26.520
The Cone of Silence.

09:26.520 --> 09:27.360
The Cone of Silence.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.180
It's done.

09:28.180 --> 09:29.020
Back Bumble Room.

09:29.020 --> 09:30.800
Wimpy, I kind of wanted to ask you too,

09:30.800 --> 09:33.240
if you don't mind commenting on your thoughts

09:33.240 --> 09:36.360
on Patreon as a source for funding an open source project.

09:36.360 --> 09:39.500
So I picture that maybe the potential audience member

09:39.500 --> 09:41.960
being somebody who has a project they're working on

09:41.960 --> 09:44.000
that does have a set amount of users

09:44.000 --> 09:46.320
that does have a certain cost to run it

09:46.320 --> 09:49.120
and they want to keep it going and keep it sustainable.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.660
How's your experience been with Patreon?

09:51.660 --> 09:55.240
Yeah, Patreon has been a positive experience

09:55.240 --> 10:00.240
and certainly is responsible for about 50% of the money

10:01.640 --> 10:04.480
that gets invested into Ubuntu Marte.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.320
Oh, wow.

10:06.240 --> 10:11.000
And then there's the PayPal supporters.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.960
There's between three and 400 people

10:14.960 --> 10:17.320
giving some money each month.

10:17.320 --> 10:20.360
And then we've got some corporate sponsorship

10:20.360 --> 10:21.800
on top of that as well.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.400
Yeah, so it's part of a blend.

10:23.400 --> 10:28.280
But the Patreon is the amount that you can actually rely on

10:28.280 --> 10:32.120
because you know month to month what's going to be coming in.

10:32.120 --> 10:36.000
And that has been essential in supporting the project

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
when we went through a very popular period

10:39.000 --> 10:42.040
where we were paying for all of our hosting and bandwidth

10:42.040 --> 10:43.280
and that was expensive.

10:43.280 --> 10:46.000
The Patreon got us through that.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.080
Now we've got the sponsorship with Bytemark.

10:49.080 --> 10:53.800
All of that money can be pushed towards funding development

10:53.800 --> 10:54.800
projects now.

10:54.800 --> 10:58.720
And so that's the thing I'm most excited about now

10:58.720 --> 11:02.160
as we, this month is the last month

11:02.160 --> 11:03.560
that we have any overhead

11:03.560 --> 11:05.680
from our previous hosting platform

11:05.680 --> 11:08.440
and we can benefit fully from the Bytemark sponsorship.

11:08.440 --> 11:11.640
So that means that the full crowdfunding

11:11.640 --> 11:13.320
or nearly the full crowdfunding,

11:13.320 --> 11:16.240
there's a few odds and ends that we have to pay for,

11:16.240 --> 11:20.040
but a lot of the crowdfunding can now go towards development.

11:20.040 --> 11:23.680
Yeah, that's, I think that's an interesting way to look at it

11:23.680 --> 11:26.640
as it's an important part of a blend overall.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.840
And it's definitely like it's the number you can see

11:28.840 --> 11:31.200
that you're gonna, you have a good estimation.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.040
I mean, there's gonna be some,

11:32.040 --> 11:33.800
there's gonna be probably some declines,

11:33.800 --> 11:35.360
but you've got a good estimation of what you're facing.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.200
Maybe like a little bit.

11:36.200 --> 11:39.800
Fluctuation month to month, you get an idea, yeah.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.520
And like Heike said, you know, keep some money in reserve

11:42.520 --> 11:45.440
for unexpected expenses.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.560
Well, let's remember this conversation

11:47.560 --> 11:49.480
when we get to the Matei update

11:49.480 --> 11:51.720
coming on a little bit later in the show.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.320
But before somebody freaks out in the chat room,

11:54.320 --> 11:55.440
we're gonna do a gaming update

11:55.440 --> 11:57.520
because the chat room's losing their crap right now.

11:57.520 --> 12:00.080
Oh my gosh, Wes, they're having a panic attack in there.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.560
It's not our fault, Gabe's been pressuring us, so.

12:02.560 --> 12:06.040
Mad Max is actually shipping on Linux in the world.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.760
I believe it's called, maybe it's just Mad Max.

12:09.760 --> 12:10.960
I don't know if it has a sub name,

12:10.960 --> 12:15.360
but October 20th for Linux and the Mac, the Mac?

12:15.360 --> 12:16.400
What is that?

12:16.400 --> 12:19.040
I don't, I'm not familiar with that.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.480
That might be a version of.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.760
Is that like Windows 8?

12:21.760 --> 12:23.480
It's not suitable for gaming, that's for sure.

12:23.480 --> 12:26.160
No, you don't play, oh, oh, oh, those are those,

12:26.160 --> 12:29.000
all right, that company that used to sell computers.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.080
I thought it was called Next.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.760
I thought they make iPhones now.

12:31.760 --> 12:33.760
It's the stuff that comes with cheese.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.160
Ba-dum-bum-bum, so that's pretty cool.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.480
So there you go, there's your October 20th,

12:38.480 --> 12:42.400
one week out heads up about the outlandish,

12:42.400 --> 12:44.900
post-apocalyptic world of Mad Max.

12:44.900 --> 12:46.800
You can go get your hands on it.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.560
And you know, have some fun, have some fun.

12:49.560 --> 12:50.600
I was just poking fun at the Mac.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.560
In fact, we're gonna, why don't we talk a little bit

12:52.560 --> 12:54.360
about the Mac here in a moment?

12:54.360 --> 12:56.560
But before we do that, I'm gonna mention

12:56.560 --> 13:00.120
that I'm gonna be at MeetBSD November 11th through the 12th,

13:00.120 --> 13:02.720
so basically 30 days, right, a month from now.

13:02.720 --> 13:03.920
That is great.

13:03.920 --> 13:07.040
Yeah, and if you're in the area, it's down by Berkeley.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.880
If you're down in that area and wanna say hi,

13:08.880 --> 13:10.640
let me know, hit me up on Twitter.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.000
And if you're gonna be at MeetBSD,

13:13.000 --> 13:14.260
you probably should go register.

13:14.260 --> 13:17.400
So you're gonna bring like a Linux laptop?

13:17.400 --> 13:20.640
Oh yeah, I'm bringing Lady Joops full of all Linux gear

13:20.640 --> 13:21.840
to the BSD conference.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.720
Hell yeah, oh yeah, I'm not going ashamed.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.040
I'm going, there's a problem.

13:26.040 --> 13:28.960
What'd you think about like putting true OS

13:28.960 --> 13:31.960
on one of your laptops or something, just to blend in?

13:31.960 --> 13:36.560
No, no, I like my backlighting and my keys to work,

13:36.560 --> 13:38.440
so I don't have any interest in that.

13:38.440 --> 13:39.440
You're interested in, you know,

13:39.440 --> 13:42.920
like recent CPU graphics support?

13:42.920 --> 13:45.200
Those kinds of things, yeah.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.640
The ability to run an Electron app would be nice.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.920
But I actually am really curious to see

13:50.920 --> 13:53.360
where their heads are at and how the BSD community

13:53.360 --> 13:54.600
does one of these things.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.160
Because I've gone to a lot of Linux events,

13:56.160 --> 13:57.960
I'm kinda curious to see what the differences are

13:57.960 --> 14:01.680
between a Linux community event and a BSD community event.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.240
And I think this is the one to go to.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.920
It is, just from what I've heard a bit coming up,

14:05.920 --> 14:07.680
it sounds like it's gonna be a wonderful event.

14:07.680 --> 14:12.680
And also, the format is one that I think is

14:13.720 --> 14:16.680
particularly appealing to me as somebody who doesn't

14:16.680 --> 14:19.120
have a lot of experience going to these conferences

14:19.120 --> 14:21.960
because this is a mixed, un-conference format,

14:21.960 --> 14:23.200
where there's scheduled talks

14:23.200 --> 14:24.600
and there's also just community driven,

14:24.600 --> 14:26.320
like this is what we care about events.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.280
So from your perspective, it's kind of an outsider.

14:28.280 --> 14:29.120
It's a lot more accessible.

14:29.120 --> 14:30.200
There's a lot more to jump into.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.320
Technical talks and.

14:31.320 --> 14:32.160
Yeah, yeah.

14:33.060 --> 14:33.900
So there you go.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.860
So you can find out more at meetbsd.com

14:35.860 --> 14:37.520
if you're gonna be down in the area.

14:37.520 --> 14:39.640
It's at the Clark Kerr campus.

14:39.640 --> 14:40.460
I'm probably saying that wrong.

14:40.460 --> 14:42.480
It's Clark Care or something,

14:42.480 --> 14:45.760
which is not, I don't think it's on the actual main

14:45.760 --> 14:47.600
UC Berkeley campus.

14:47.600 --> 14:48.440
I should probably get that figured out.

14:48.440 --> 14:49.320
You should get that figured out.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.160
Yeah, you're gonna have to.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.360
That's what, you're gonna have to get there.

14:51.360 --> 14:52.520
I don't know if you realize that.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.680
I'm hoping that that's what NAV is for.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.400
No, I'll drive, I'm gonna drive us

14:56.400 --> 15:00.560
to about 45 minutes away and then listener Ben

15:00.560 --> 15:02.760
is being nice enough to let me borrow his car.

15:02.760 --> 15:03.600
Oh, really?

15:03.600 --> 15:06.040
Oh, well thank you listener Ben, that's awesome.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.980
Ben, he's actually been in the Rover log before.

15:08.980 --> 15:09.820
Oh, right.

15:09.820 --> 15:10.940
Yeah, he might get another appearance

15:10.940 --> 15:13.000
in the Rover log again.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.320
But so that's sort of my plan

15:14.320 --> 15:16.160
and then maybe meet up with folks.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.540
I'm just gonna be down there for a few days,

15:17.540 --> 15:19.160
but if you're in the Berkeley area

15:19.160 --> 15:20.200
and wanna hang out and say hi,

15:20.200 --> 15:21.060
that could be a lot of fun.

15:21.060 --> 15:25.100
So meetbsd.com if you wanna hang out and chat

15:25.100 --> 15:27.200
and let me know what you think about,

15:27.200 --> 15:29.240
you know, whatever's on your mind,

15:29.240 --> 15:31.360
particularly in the Linux world.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.680
Digitalocean.com, that's what's on my mind.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.440
Go there and use our promo code

15:35.440 --> 15:36.800
to get a $10 credit.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.240
Go over to digitalocean.com

15:38.240 --> 15:39.840
and remember, if you use our promo code,

15:39.840 --> 15:42.560
it's one word, all lowercase,

15:42.560 --> 15:45.160
you get yourself a $10 credit, DO Unplugged.

15:45.160 --> 15:47.780
You apply that $10 credit to your account

15:47.780 --> 15:49.600
and then you can drive the $5 rig two months for free

15:49.600 --> 15:51.640
or run one of their hourly machines

15:51.640 --> 15:54.380
and just run that balance until you're done with it.

15:54.380 --> 15:55.260
It's really kinda cool

15:55.260 --> 15:57.320
and there's like no risk there to that.

15:57.320 --> 15:58.380
Right, you don't get overages,

15:58.380 --> 15:59.960
you don't get like, it's just,

15:59.960 --> 16:01.000
they'll turn it off if you stop paying,

16:01.000 --> 16:01.880
but that's just fine.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.360
Yeah, and it's a great way

16:03.360 --> 16:05.120
to try out the DigitalOcean services

16:05.120 --> 16:06.200
to see if it works for you.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.660
And they have data centers in New York,

16:07.660 --> 16:09.240
San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

16:09.240 --> 16:12.240
London, Toronto, Germany, India.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.520
They have a really nice interface

16:13.520 --> 16:14.680
to manage all of this.

16:14.680 --> 16:16.740
It's very simple, but yet very powerful.

16:16.740 --> 16:18.000
They have great, powerful machines

16:18.000 --> 16:20.120
that'll all use SSD storage.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.560
They have an interface that rocks,

16:21.560 --> 16:23.120
but they have an API that matches.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.040
And one of the semi-recent features

16:25.040 --> 16:26.200
that I think is really great

16:26.200 --> 16:28.660
and answered a lot of people's questions

16:29.660 --> 16:31.040
is this block storage.

16:31.040 --> 16:33.880
You can attach block storage up to 16 terabytes,

16:33.880 --> 16:37.920
all of it, resizable, SSD backed, super cool.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.160
Play with that.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.200
And also, I had an MB server

16:41.200 --> 16:42.360
right up there for a long time,

16:42.360 --> 16:44.360
and this would be something,

16:44.360 --> 16:45.800
I don't even have to have something massive,

16:45.800 --> 16:47.640
but just like the kids' movie collection,

16:47.640 --> 16:49.240
so it's available when we're traveling,

16:49.240 --> 16:50.320
would be wonderful.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.320
You know, I've really been enjoying it.

16:51.320 --> 16:54.000
It seems like they're picking and choosing,

16:54.000 --> 16:55.560
something like AWS or Azure,

16:55.560 --> 16:56.580
or the bigger cloud platforms,

16:56.580 --> 16:59.280
they have a thousand and one features.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.880
Very complicated, lots of documentation.

17:01.880 --> 17:03.200
DigitalOcean seems to be taking the best,

17:03.200 --> 17:05.000
like the floating IPs, like the block storage,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.480
they're kind of taking the best of the bunch.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.400
So you have the features you need,

17:09.400 --> 17:10.720
but in a simple interface,

17:10.720 --> 17:12.700
something you can understand and get going in 10 minutes.

17:12.700 --> 17:15.280
And it, I mean, less, way less than that.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.080
Probably a minute.

17:17.080 --> 17:19.760
I think that might be why I keep creating droplets,

17:19.760 --> 17:21.080
is when I just wanna try out something

17:21.080 --> 17:22.080
I found on GitHub even,

17:22.080 --> 17:23.720
and I don't wanna bother putting that on my machine

17:23.720 --> 17:25.960
for security reasons, for simplicity reasons, or whatever.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.580
You just don't wanna install some more things

17:27.580 --> 17:28.420
that you don't need.

17:28.420 --> 17:30.040
Yeah, and I can just spin it up in seconds

17:30.040 --> 17:31.280
on DigitalOcean, try it out,

17:31.280 --> 17:32.400
and then keep it or destroy it.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.800
And you get that public IP, right?

17:34.800 --> 17:35.640
You don't have to worry about firewalls,

17:35.640 --> 17:37.700
you don't have to just like, boom.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.600
Super cool, and they make managing DNS,

17:39.600 --> 17:41.120
if you wanna go that route, really easy too.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.720
And adding your SSH keys, all of it's great.

17:43.720 --> 17:45.960
All with different Linux droplets you can deploy and enjoy.

17:45.960 --> 17:48.880
DigitalOcean.com, just use our promo code,

17:48.880 --> 17:51.720
DOUNPLUGGED, that's one word, lowercase.

17:51.720 --> 17:52.960
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean

17:52.960 --> 17:55.960
for sponsoring the unplugged program, DOUNPLUGGED.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.720
So we were teasing Mac OS.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.760
And I do actually have something kind of newsworthy

18:01.760 --> 18:03.120
to talk about with Mac OS.

18:03.120 --> 18:05.000
But before we get there.

18:05.000 --> 18:05.840
Before we talk about that.

18:05.840 --> 18:06.680
Just a fun little thing.

18:06.680 --> 18:07.800
Just an interesting diversion

18:07.800 --> 18:09.380
because I've seen this floating around

18:09.380 --> 18:10.600
for a couple of weeks now,

18:10.600 --> 18:11.780
and you've probably heard of it before,

18:11.780 --> 18:14.160
but if you haven't, I think you're gonna enjoy this.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.820
It's Xenix, and it was Microsoft's Unix back in the day.

18:17.820 --> 18:20.560
Microsoft, before they got all DOS happy,

18:20.560 --> 18:22.000
first experimented with creating

18:22.000 --> 18:24.500
a Unix-based operating system.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.720
And they called it Xenix,

18:25.720 --> 18:28.400
and it was part of a messy breakup

18:28.400 --> 18:31.440
between AT&T and IBM, so it didn't really work out.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.200
But back in the late 1970s,

18:34.200 --> 18:36.980
Microsoft entered into an agreement with AT&T Corporation

18:36.980 --> 18:39.720
to license Unix from AT&T.

18:40.980 --> 18:44.000
While the company didn't sell the OS to anybody in public,

18:44.000 --> 18:47.960
it licensed it to other OEMs like Intel, SCO, and Tandy.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.720
It's fun to hear that name.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.640
As Microsoft had to face legal trouble

18:51.640 --> 18:53.120
due to the use of the Unix name,

18:53.120 --> 18:54.200
the company renamed it

18:54.200 --> 18:56.580
and came up with its own Unix distribution.

18:56.580 --> 18:58.120
So AT&T licensed Unix,

18:59.240 --> 19:01.120
was passed around to other OEMs

19:01.120 --> 19:02.120
as Xenix.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.040
However, in the early 1980s,

19:05.040 --> 19:08.800
IBM was looking for an OS to power its x86 PC.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.920
As IBM didn't want to maintain any titles,

19:10.920 --> 19:15.140
I'm sorry, any ties with the recently split up AT&T,

19:15.140 --> 19:17.560
Xenix was automatically rejected.

19:17.560 --> 19:18.400
Bum bum.

19:18.400 --> 19:19.840
To fulfill the tech giant's demand,

19:19.840 --> 19:22.240
Microsoft, they scrambled and they bought 86 DOS

19:22.240 --> 19:24.480
from a Seattle computer products company

19:24.480 --> 19:27.280
and managed to convince IBM to use it in their systems.

19:27.280 --> 19:30.000
Slowly, Microsoft began to lose interest in Xenix

19:30.000 --> 19:34.600
and then traded the full rights of Xenix to SCO later on,

19:34.600 --> 19:35.620
because they were one of the partners.

19:35.620 --> 19:39.160
And that is how Microsoft started to create a Unix,

19:39.160 --> 19:41.840
was almost made at the base of their desktop operating.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.480
And then they went all wrong.

19:43.480 --> 19:46.380
But because IBM didn't want to have any ties to AT&T.

19:46.380 --> 19:48.240
Boy, those Unix wars sure were messy.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.080
They were dirty.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.920
I mean, we live in such a simpler, more open,

19:53.100 --> 19:53.940
I'm very thankful for it.

19:53.940 --> 19:55.300
I don't think a lot of us have a perspective

19:55.300 --> 19:56.140
of how dirty they were.

19:56.140 --> 19:56.960
No, right?

19:56.960 --> 19:58.440
And I mean, like you still had all the Unix goodness

19:58.440 --> 19:59.680
if you were lucky enough to be able to afford it

19:59.680 --> 20:01.480
and have a big enough system to run it on,

20:01.480 --> 20:03.840
but those were different times.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.340
Back in my day.

20:05.340 --> 20:08.440
All right, so now speaking of a Unix desktop

20:08.440 --> 20:09.640
that doesn't make a very good Unix,

20:09.640 --> 20:14.340
Mac OS 10.12 has a broken poll.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.740
A broken poll.

20:16.740 --> 20:19.360
The poll function, which actually breaks things like curl.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.400
So curl doesn't work on Mac OS anymore.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.480
Which that actually does suck quite a bit.

20:23.480 --> 20:24.320
Wow.

20:24.320 --> 20:25.720
Yeah.

20:25.720 --> 20:26.800
Yeah, that sucks.

20:26.800 --> 20:30.100
And I thought this first comment from ITP on Hacker News

20:30.100 --> 20:31.160
was pretty well put.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.880
He says, I can't say I'm surprised.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.040
I used to be responsible for the port and upkeep

20:35.040 --> 20:37.480
of relatively low-level products on OS 10.

20:37.480 --> 20:40.300
It was far and away the most troublesome platform.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.960
We would frequently run into bugs

20:41.960 --> 20:43.800
that had been reported on open radar for years

20:43.800 --> 20:45.160
without having been addressed.

20:45.160 --> 20:47.140
Offhand, I remember spending the better part of two days

20:47.140 --> 20:48.640
trying to understand a bug that was traced

20:48.640 --> 20:50.880
to a core routine issue.

20:50.880 --> 20:53.360
OS 10 was just not saving a required register

20:53.360 --> 20:58.000
known and reported for five major versions of the OS.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.880
I remember discovering the unnamed semaphores.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.300
I remember discovering the unnamed semaphores

21:01.300 --> 21:03.160
don't work on OS 10.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.020
Also, I'm not surprised the poll would be broken,

21:05.020 --> 21:06.360
nor am I surprised it was broken again

21:06.360 --> 21:07.880
because it's been broken in the past.

21:07.880 --> 21:08.880
The only thing that surprised me anymore

21:08.880 --> 21:10.120
is how many people continue to insist

21:10.120 --> 21:14.880
that Mac OS, or now just Mac OS, is a great Unix.

21:14.880 --> 21:15.880
It might be a nice desktop,

21:15.880 --> 21:18.360
but it is definitely not a great Unix.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.240
And I think that is the takeaway point.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.400
It might make a great desktop,

21:22.400 --> 21:23.880
but don't fool yourself into thinking

21:23.880 --> 21:25.240
you're getting a great Unix desktop,

21:25.240 --> 21:26.440
power workstation or something.

21:26.440 --> 21:27.280
It's not that.

21:27.280 --> 21:29.280
I think at least part of that is when they started

21:29.280 --> 21:31.840
building Mac OS X, and for a long time,

21:31.840 --> 21:34.000
they compete with what the Unix kernel,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.200
or Linux kernel, Linux user land was doing, right?

21:36.200 --> 21:38.840
And you got this nice UI, you got Photoshop,

21:38.840 --> 21:40.000
you got all that on the platform,

21:40.000 --> 21:41.440
as well as you could run Bash and curl

21:41.440 --> 21:43.000
and all that thing in a shell.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.440
But they haven't spent any time or energy or money

21:46.440 --> 21:48.280
on working on that user land on those kind

21:48.280 --> 21:50.600
of kernel features like pull or any of that.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.560
And the BSDs, Linux, we're all moving on

21:53.560 --> 21:54.400
and doing more things.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.200
And so suddenly you're like, well.

21:56.200 --> 21:58.520
But what's weird about it is they're breaking stuff

21:58.520 --> 22:00.800
in their Unix land that they just simply wouldn't touch,

22:00.800 --> 22:01.680
wouldn't be broken.

22:01.680 --> 22:04.120
But they're like, they won't just leave it be.

22:04.120 --> 22:06.480
They're breaking it almost proactively,

22:06.480 --> 22:08.120
which is super frustrating.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.840
Now, this is a segue, but then you combine that

22:10.840 --> 22:12.600
with their shocking lack of hardware updates.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.240
You start to wonder, what is their long-term vision

22:15.240 --> 22:18.160
for the Mac OS platform and for their Intel machines?

22:18.160 --> 22:19.760
And so it's within that context

22:19.760 --> 22:20.680
that our next story comes up.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.360
Linus was talking about ARM.

22:22.360 --> 22:25.360
He was at a fireside chat.

22:25.360 --> 22:26.680
He was talking with David Rusling,

22:26.680 --> 22:29.200
who is the Chief Technology Officer of ARM Tools.

22:29.200 --> 22:30.160
And so this guy.

22:31.080 --> 22:31.920
He knows ARM.

22:31.920 --> 22:32.800
This guy really knows ARM.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.840
And so he's asking Linus questions about ARM.

22:34.840 --> 22:36.240
And Linus is being very honest.

22:36.240 --> 22:38.880
He's like, you know, ARM doesn't really excite me.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.640
Which is interesting, too, just given Linus's history

22:40.640 --> 22:42.680
with, you know, one, Linux, and two, his history

22:42.680 --> 22:45.320
designing processor architectures and stuff.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.560
And he talked about not just because of the instruction

22:47.560 --> 22:50.080
that he says is more than that, it's the whole ecosystem.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.240
So I grabbed just a little bit of the interview

22:52.240 --> 22:53.960
so we could hear it here on the show.

22:53.960 --> 22:55.320
I'll just play a moment of it.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.240
And this is, I'll link to the show notes, too,

22:57.240 --> 22:58.720
if you want to watch the entire thing.

22:58.720 --> 23:00.160
This is no bad thing.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.320
Do you have a favorite architecture?

23:06.640 --> 23:08.080
That's a very obvious question.

23:08.080 --> 23:13.080
I mean, x86 is still the one I favor most.

23:13.240 --> 23:15.160
And the reason for that is the PC.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.520
Not because of the architecture.

23:16.520 --> 23:18.200
It's because of the infrastructure.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.880
It's because it's there and it's open.

23:21.880 --> 23:26.600
And it's open in a way that no other architecture is.

23:26.600 --> 23:31.600
And it turns out the instruction set

23:31.880 --> 23:36.880
and the core of the CPU is not very important.

23:36.880 --> 23:41.880
And it's one of those big differentiating factors

23:42.440 --> 23:45.000
that people kind of fixate on,

23:45.000 --> 23:47.320
but it really doesn't matter very much.

23:47.320 --> 23:48.520
I think that's interesting.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.440
What matters is all the infrastructure

23:50.440 --> 23:53.160
around that instruction set.

23:53.160 --> 23:57.320
And x86 right now has all that infrastructure.

23:57.320 --> 24:00.080
And it has it at a lot of different levels.

24:01.160 --> 24:04.200
ARM obviously has it on the low end.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.400
There's no question that if you're in mobile,

24:06.400 --> 24:07.760
you are pretty much ARM,

24:07.760 --> 24:11.180
and we can start forgetting about MIPS and everybody else.

24:11.180 --> 24:16.180
I've been personally, obviously, pretty disappointed in ARM.

24:17.620 --> 24:18.860
Not as an instruction set,

24:18.860 --> 24:21.380
although I've had my issues there too.

24:21.380 --> 24:26.020
But as a hardware platform,

24:26.020 --> 24:29.620
it's still not very pleasant to deal with.

24:29.620 --> 24:31.980
And it goes on.

24:31.980 --> 24:33.100
He says, of course, you guys know that.

24:33.100 --> 24:35.180
You guys are working with ARM all the time.

24:35.180 --> 24:38.880
So now we segue from this, talking about ARM,

24:38.880 --> 24:40.980
to talking about Wes's $9 computer,

24:40.980 --> 24:42.900
the Chip, which he's brought into the studio here.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.520
So Wes bought the Chip,

24:44.520 --> 24:47.020
which you might've heard us talk about before at getchip.com.

24:47.020 --> 24:50.900
It's the world's first $9 computer.

24:50.900 --> 24:52.860
And you got it right here in your hot little hands, Wes.

24:52.860 --> 24:54.320
Tell me about it.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.540
I just showed up in the mail.

24:55.540 --> 24:57.820
It got sent to my old address.

24:57.820 --> 24:58.660
It's itty bitty.

24:58.660 --> 24:59.480
It is itty bitty.

24:59.480 --> 25:02.180
I also got the HDMI adapter.

25:02.180 --> 25:04.500
I've really only plugged it in a tiny amount.

25:04.500 --> 25:07.300
But they do kinda come with, unlike say the Pi,

25:07.300 --> 25:09.060
they have a little plastic bottom already.

25:09.060 --> 25:12.100
So it's kinda, it's a little more rough and ready to go.

25:12.100 --> 25:13.500
So it came with that plastic bottom?

25:13.500 --> 25:14.340
You didn't add that on, huh?

25:14.340 --> 25:15.320
Nope.

25:15.320 --> 25:16.560
Huh, that's nice.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.420
Did you really pay nine bucks though?

25:18.420 --> 25:20.620
Well, no, I paid like $21, I think,

25:20.620 --> 25:23.340
with the HDMI output adapter.

25:23.340 --> 25:24.340
Oh, okay.

25:24.340 --> 25:27.100
Yeah, so it has a gigahertz processor,

25:27.100 --> 25:30.800
Wi-Fi BGN built in, four gigs of high-speed storage.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.220
Is that an SD card that came with it?

25:32.220 --> 25:33.640
Is that when they say high-speed storage,

25:33.640 --> 25:35.300
they mean an SD card on the USB bus?

25:35.300 --> 25:36.420
Is that high-speed storage?

25:36.420 --> 25:37.740
I'm not sure.

25:37.740 --> 25:39.900
Chip comes with storage on board, ah.

25:39.900 --> 25:40.740
There we go.

25:40.740 --> 25:41.920
Yeah, well, there's no need to purchase.

25:41.920 --> 25:44.100
So it actually is high-speed storage.

25:44.100 --> 25:44.940
Yes, exactly.

25:44.940 --> 25:48.100
Bluetooth 4.0, and yeah, you got it with the HDMI port,

25:48.100 --> 25:49.820
and it comes with 512 megabytes of RAM.

25:49.820 --> 25:51.140
Anybody in the mummer room got their hands

25:51.140 --> 25:52.620
on this thing yet?

25:52.620 --> 25:53.460
This chip?

25:55.080 --> 25:57.300
I will say, well, I don't know what I'm gonna quite do

25:57.300 --> 25:58.640
with it, I bought it mostly to support it.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.260
Oh, go on.

26:00.260 --> 26:02.180
Whoa, whoa, I think that was a, hello?

26:02.180 --> 26:03.540
I think that was a Cylon.

26:03.540 --> 26:04.380
It might've been a Cylon.

26:04.380 --> 26:05.220
It might've been a Cylon, we're compromised.

26:05.220 --> 26:06.060
That might've been a chip.

26:06.060 --> 26:06.880
We're compromised.

26:06.880 --> 26:08.220
Yeah.

26:08.220 --> 26:09.060
Yeah.

26:09.940 --> 26:11.620
Have you seen the Pocket chip, though?

26:11.620 --> 26:12.900
Their little case around it?

26:12.900 --> 26:14.660
I was gonna ask you if you were tempted to get that.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.820
Yeah, you know, and I have a friend who has one,

26:16.820 --> 26:17.960
and it's pretty cool.

26:17.960 --> 26:20.540
It's a, he's still kind of learning Linux,

26:20.540 --> 26:23.080
but he, it's like a great little platform

26:23.080 --> 26:25.100
to have on the bus, you know, playing with Linux.

26:25.100 --> 26:27.080
You have a real shell, you can do stuff.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.060
It also seems like something that Noah might be interested

26:29.060 --> 26:30.940
in, just knowing how much he wants to have

26:30.940 --> 26:33.220
a real Linux computer in his back pocket all of the time.

26:33.220 --> 26:34.060
That's true.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.780
And it's not like, you know, it's not like a full laptop

26:35.780 --> 26:37.420
or anything, but you could get a lot done.

26:37.420 --> 26:40.060
I could imagine doing some SSH and then doing real work

26:40.060 --> 26:42.600
or building things or, you know, like bouncing some servers

26:42.600 --> 26:43.440
or whatever you need to do.

26:43.440 --> 26:46.260
Is it a QWERTY keyboard or is it,

26:46.260 --> 26:48.400
oh no, it's not, it's, well, it has a QWERTY layout.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.700
It's like a multifunction keyboard.

26:49.700 --> 26:50.540
Yeah.

26:50.540 --> 26:52.060
So this would be an obvious thing to do

26:52.060 --> 26:53.980
with your chip computer, is the Pocket chip.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.420
So I think that's a really smart move they did,

26:55.420 --> 26:57.660
was they're like, well, we'll just sell a great accessory

26:57.660 --> 26:59.480
for it to give people something to do with it.

26:59.480 --> 27:01.320
And the Pocket chip's 69 bucks.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.440
You know, and I do still like like the Onion Omega stuff

27:03.440 --> 27:04.700
that Alan was talking about.

27:04.700 --> 27:06.580
I think that's maybe a more interesting platform.

27:06.580 --> 27:09.180
But when this was first coming out,

27:09.180 --> 27:10.940
it seems like an interesting kind of middle ground

27:10.940 --> 27:13.900
between, you know, like the Arduino microcontroller layer

27:13.900 --> 27:15.620
and then something more like a Raspberry Pi.

27:15.620 --> 27:19.940
This seems more friendly for some reason.

27:19.940 --> 27:24.940
Like the pitch of it is more a fun toy kind of thing.

27:25.140 --> 27:26.580
That's, you know, kind of neat.

27:26.580 --> 27:29.300
And I mean, maybe that's the Pocket chip

27:29.300 --> 27:30.660
that's kind of giving me that vibe

27:30.660 --> 27:34.140
because it makes it seem more like a game, more like a toy.

27:34.140 --> 27:37.700
So if you don't use it, if you don't get the Pocket chip,

27:37.700 --> 27:39.540
what's sort of your use case for something like this?

27:39.540 --> 27:42.900
For a $9, I mean, you got a gigahertz and 512 megs of RAM.

27:42.900 --> 27:43.900
I mean, it's a gigahertz on,

27:43.900 --> 27:47.100
but damn, that's amazing for even 20 bucks.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.760
You know, I really don't have a use case yet.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.060
So if anyone in the audience has something

27:50.060 --> 27:51.700
that you want me to try, I'd be happy to.

27:51.700 --> 27:52.980
I'm going to try to find somewhere

27:52.980 --> 27:54.260
I can put it around the house.

27:54.260 --> 27:56.380
It does have HDMI out, so I will test like,

27:56.380 --> 27:57.640
what does that kind of look like?

27:57.640 --> 27:59.500
What can you play with that?

27:59.500 --> 28:01.220
But it also has the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi built in.

28:01.220 --> 28:03.900
So I could see it, you know, if you have any,

28:03.900 --> 28:06.400
it does have a USB port here.

28:06.400 --> 28:08.460
So like any kind of sensor or anything else

28:08.460 --> 28:09.460
that was integrated over USB

28:09.460 --> 28:10.580
that you wanted to put on your network,

28:10.580 --> 28:11.420
or, you know, like we were talking about

28:11.420 --> 28:14.300
that USB IP kernel support with Linux.

28:14.300 --> 28:15.140
Kind of that'd be great for that.

28:15.140 --> 28:15.960
You could plug that right in here,

28:15.960 --> 28:17.100
just set it right next to it.

28:17.100 --> 28:20.560
If it's, that'd be really an interesting use case for it.

28:20.560 --> 28:25.560
Tiny remote sensors or remote IP USB could be game changer.

28:25.780 --> 28:26.820
But it's, you know, that's the nice thing

28:26.820 --> 28:28.620
where it's like you're not writing C++ code

28:28.620 --> 28:29.540
and compiling it to run on,

28:29.540 --> 28:32.580
or do we know you're like, it's the Linux user land.

28:32.580 --> 28:33.400
That is really cool.

28:33.400 --> 28:35.300
Yourwiseass, you had a comment, go ahead.

28:36.620 --> 28:41.620
Yeah, I'm pinging to the outside and doing speed tests

28:42.860 --> 28:47.860
so it can tweet if my speed sinks below a certain level.

28:48.540 --> 28:50.940
So you're kind of keeping an eye on your ISP

28:50.940 --> 28:52.780
and kind of getting a little bit of a heads up

28:52.780 --> 28:55.580
when they're not delivering what you're paying for.

28:55.580 --> 28:57.420
That's pretty clever. Exactly.

28:57.420 --> 28:58.260
Yeah, I like that.

28:58.260 --> 28:59.320
Oh, maybe that's why I should do that too.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.480
You know, I'm on a, at Lady Jupiter.

29:01.480 --> 29:04.120
Oh, I wonder, and I would love suggestions

29:04.120 --> 29:07.440
on maybe the best tool to do this, or tools.

29:07.440 --> 29:11.800
But at Lady Jupiter, my internet connection

29:11.800 --> 29:14.840
slowly degrades over a period of few days.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.800
And it seems to be based on my usage

29:18.300 --> 29:21.040
because what solves it every single time

29:21.040 --> 29:22.960
is I reboot the MiFi.

29:22.960 --> 29:25.760
I restart the MiFi, I pull the battery out,

29:25.760 --> 29:27.680
put it back in, let it boot up,

29:27.680 --> 29:29.480
then I plug into the cradle point.

29:29.480 --> 29:31.380
I was gonna say, is this some sort of traffic shaping?

29:31.380 --> 29:32.880
But it doesn't seem like it, no.

29:32.880 --> 29:33.720
I don't know.

29:33.720 --> 29:36.800
I don't know if it is, and maybe when I reestablish

29:36.800 --> 29:38.380
a connection to the network, it clears.

29:38.380 --> 29:39.920
That could be a possibility.

29:39.920 --> 29:42.680
Or it is like the operating system

29:42.680 --> 29:45.180
on this little MiFi device could be completely

29:45.180 --> 29:46.440
falling apart. Right.

29:46.440 --> 29:49.420
And maybe it's like running out of RAM or whatever.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.360
And you know, maybe that WiFis aren't,

29:51.360 --> 29:53.080
or MiFis or whatever, aren't quite designed

29:53.080 --> 29:54.820
for the throughput that you put through them.

29:54.820 --> 29:55.660
Sure.

29:55.660 --> 29:56.800
Or there's memory leaks.

29:56.800 --> 29:59.500
You know, I have a, I'm gonna do a video

29:59.500 --> 30:00.840
on all of this stuff one day.

30:00.840 --> 30:01.920
I'm excited for it.

30:01.920 --> 30:03.240
But I'm still building it all out,

30:03.240 --> 30:06.700
but I have a WeBoost cellular booster

30:06.700 --> 30:11.040
that captures all LTE bands from all carriers,

30:11.040 --> 30:12.600
brings them into Lady Jupiter,

30:12.600 --> 30:14.640
and then amplifies them by 60 dB.

30:15.560 --> 30:16.840
Yeah, it's awesome.

30:16.840 --> 30:19.160
So I can go from one bar to four bars.

30:19.160 --> 30:20.000
How big is that?

30:20.000 --> 30:21.520
Not big, not big.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.360
Wow.

30:22.360 --> 30:25.560
The trickiest thing about it is the antenna

30:25.560 --> 30:27.840
that receives the wireless signals

30:27.840 --> 30:30.520
and the little thing in Lady Jupiter

30:30.520 --> 30:32.760
that's rebroadcasting the signals,

30:32.760 --> 30:33.940
the two can never meet.

30:33.940 --> 30:36.020
And if the booster main antenna

30:36.020 --> 30:37.920
is even picking up the rebroadcaster,

30:37.920 --> 30:38.840
it totally shuts down.

30:38.840 --> 30:39.680
Right, yep.

30:39.680 --> 30:41.320
It does a feedback loop and it totally.

30:41.320 --> 30:44.960
And in an RV, that is a particular challenge

30:44.960 --> 30:47.920
because basically the RV is barely long

30:47.920 --> 30:50.040
as the minimum requirements are

30:50.040 --> 30:51.440
for these things to be a part.

30:51.440 --> 30:54.100
So I have a booster coming into this MiFi.

30:54.100 --> 30:56.040
It's blasting it with a bunch of signal.

30:56.040 --> 30:57.960
And so when everything's going great,

30:57.960 --> 31:01.040
I'll get 23 megabits maybe on a.

31:01.040 --> 31:03.280
That's not bad, especially for parking in the boonies.

31:03.280 --> 31:04.160
Yeah, exactly.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.880
I am on the coast.

31:05.880 --> 31:08.520
I am literally on, I walk, I walk,

31:08.520 --> 31:10.040
I walk 10 minutes and I'm in the ocean.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.520
So I'm like far out in the boonies as it can be.

31:12.520 --> 31:16.520
And to go from one bar to four is 20 megabits.

31:16.520 --> 31:18.680
I was like, oh God, this makes this usable.

31:18.680 --> 31:19.520
This is like.

31:19.520 --> 31:20.340
I have the internet.

31:20.340 --> 31:22.280
Yeah, and then a few days into it,

31:22.280 --> 31:24.000
I'm down to two megabits.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.360
So of course, stupid Chris,

31:25.360 --> 31:26.800
first thing I'm thinking is well,

31:26.800 --> 31:28.480
maybe my antenna fell down.

31:28.480 --> 31:29.880
So I'm climbing back up on my roof.

31:29.880 --> 31:30.720
Yeah, I'm troubleshooting the connections.

31:30.720 --> 31:31.840
You're all the way at layer one.

31:31.840 --> 31:34.240
Yeah, I'm redoing all the connections

31:34.240 --> 31:35.840
and still two megabits, two megabits.

31:35.840 --> 31:37.720
I'm like, well shit, this is just as bad as it was

31:37.720 --> 31:38.640
before I got the booster.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.200
Like what the hell's going on here?

31:40.200 --> 31:42.380
And then as a part of my troubleshooting,

31:42.380 --> 31:45.760
I left, I did every piece individually

31:45.760 --> 31:47.880
so I could determine what was the cause.

31:47.880 --> 31:51.280
And of course, I made sure to troubleshoot the MiFi

31:51.280 --> 31:52.880
sort of separately.

31:52.880 --> 31:56.560
And sure enough, huge difference after a clean reboot.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.760
And it's better with the booster,

31:57.760 --> 31:59.320
but even without the booster,

31:59.320 --> 32:02.120
I could get six, seven megabits

32:02.120 --> 32:03.560
and it would go down to like two megabits.

32:03.560 --> 32:05.080
And now with the booster, after I reboot,

32:05.080 --> 32:06.240
I get like 22 megabits.

32:06.240 --> 32:10.360
But after about five days, I don't know what's on it.

32:10.360 --> 32:12.160
Yeah, I feel like that's one of the last things.

32:12.160 --> 32:13.280
It's older, I think.

32:13.280 --> 32:15.320
We have these weird proprietary little things

32:15.320 --> 32:17.440
that join us to the LTE networks.

32:17.440 --> 32:18.860
I wonder if like, has Noah experienced any of that

32:18.860 --> 32:20.280
with his like ThinkPads built in?

32:20.280 --> 32:21.100
I don't know.

32:21.100 --> 32:23.260
But see, maybe, see this is running 24 seven

32:23.260 --> 32:25.240
continuously for days.

32:25.240 --> 32:26.920
It's your gateway.

32:26.920 --> 32:28.640
Yeah, and then I have stuff that's all on the land

32:28.640 --> 32:30.560
that I have stuff that determines

32:30.560 --> 32:31.580
what goes out over the internet,

32:31.580 --> 32:33.200
but the actual connection itself is open

32:33.200 --> 32:34.440
and running all the time.

32:34.440 --> 32:36.360
So I've been wondering if there would be

32:36.360 --> 32:39.840
a good open source tool to easily warn me

32:39.840 --> 32:41.720
when it's dropped below a certain threshold.

32:41.720 --> 32:43.080
So like if I could monitor,

32:43.080 --> 32:45.620
but I don't want the act of testing it

32:45.620 --> 32:47.960
to eat up the precious amount of bandwidth I do have

32:47.960 --> 32:50.820
because over the MiFi, it's not just the speed,

32:50.820 --> 32:54.040
but anything that introduces additional latency or traffic

32:54.040 --> 32:56.280
sort of degrades the connection for everybody.

32:56.280 --> 32:59.720
It's not like 20 megabits on a cable connection.

33:00.680 --> 33:03.120
So I would love to be able to test that and map it

33:03.120 --> 33:04.880
and alert myself when it starts to say

33:04.880 --> 33:07.680
get down like the five megabit range or something

33:09.040 --> 33:12.160
without having to also stress the connection all the time.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.000
That's a good question.

33:13.000 --> 33:13.880
You know, because I've kind of wondered about that too.

33:13.880 --> 33:15.460
Like it would be nice to just have that,

33:15.460 --> 33:16.640
something that makes it really easy

33:16.640 --> 33:20.200
to kind of see your graphs of like upstream bandwidth.

33:20.200 --> 33:23.680
So I was thinking a Raspberry Pi of types of sorts

33:23.680 --> 33:25.400
that would, so I don't know.

33:25.400 --> 33:26.600
If anybody has a suggestion,

33:26.600 --> 33:28.360
tweet me at Chris LAS or something like that

33:28.360 --> 33:29.760
that I could run on a Pi or run on,

33:29.760 --> 33:32.040
or I guess I could run it on the laptop.

33:32.040 --> 33:34.560
I mean, cause there is always the worst case scenario

33:34.560 --> 33:37.920
where you run a cron job with a speed test.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.120
Yeah, yeah.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.440
Yeah, just use speed test.

33:40.440 --> 33:41.680
If the results are below this,

33:41.680 --> 33:42.520
but it'd be cooler to have something

33:42.520 --> 33:45.400
that like also graphs the output, a thresholding,

33:45.400 --> 33:47.220
and I mean, you could always send it

33:47.220 --> 33:49.320
into something like Graphite or Grafana.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.340
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

33:50.340 --> 33:51.180
Yeah, that would be, yeah,

33:51.180 --> 33:52.720
something that would give me sort of a historical,

33:52.720 --> 33:54.520
like this is where you're starting to get down.

33:54.520 --> 33:55.920
And then maybe you can kind of observe the trends

33:55.920 --> 33:57.160
and really figure out what's going on.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.560
Those guys over at the Ubuntu podcast

33:58.560 --> 34:00.140
have been getting suggestions from their audience

34:00.140 --> 34:01.880
on things to do with their Pis.

34:01.880 --> 34:03.720
So if you pick up from there.

34:03.720 --> 34:04.720
Yeah, if one comes your way,

34:04.720 --> 34:08.080
that sounds like it would maybe solve my problem.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.280
Mr. Popey or Mr. Wimpy, pass it along to me,

34:10.280 --> 34:11.480
cause I'd be really curious to know

34:11.480 --> 34:13.120
if there's a set of tools out there

34:13.120 --> 34:15.860
or even like a ready-built distro for network monitoring.

34:15.860 --> 34:17.760
That seems like that should be a thing

34:17.760 --> 34:20.640
that would run on a Raspberry Pi image or something.

34:20.640 --> 34:22.640
Well, we've had a bumper crop of feedback

34:22.640 --> 34:24.720
on the Raspberry Pi stuff.

34:24.720 --> 34:27.240
For the next episode, it's been running and running

34:27.240 --> 34:28.720
for weeks since we asked for it.

34:28.720 --> 34:29.960
Yeah, and the projects are getting

34:29.960 --> 34:31.960
more and more interesting.

34:31.960 --> 34:32.880
I will catch the next one

34:32.880 --> 34:34.320
that if there's another batch of it.

34:34.320 --> 34:36.680
Not that I wasn't going to anyway.

34:36.680 --> 34:39.200
Before we go much further, while I'm talking about Mifis,

34:39.200 --> 34:42.360
why not mention my friends over at the Ting network?

34:42.360 --> 34:44.440
Oh, you see how we just did that right there?

34:44.440 --> 34:45.280
Sneak it in there.

34:45.280 --> 34:47.760
Linux.ting.com, that's where you go to support the show

34:47.760 --> 34:49.800
and get the discount, linux.ting.com.

34:49.800 --> 34:52.040
We'll take $25 off your first device,

34:52.040 --> 34:53.860
or we'll give you $25 in service credit

34:53.860 --> 34:55.160
if you bring a device.

34:55.160 --> 34:57.600
What's nuts about Ting is their customer service.

34:59.040 --> 35:01.080
Have I ever played this video here on this here show, Wes?

35:01.080 --> 35:03.480
This video from the Ting customer service.

35:03.480 --> 35:04.380
This is what it's like.

35:04.380 --> 35:05.220
We look at it a lot, but.

35:05.220 --> 35:06.060
This is what it's like.

35:06.060 --> 35:07.440
No, this is the video right here.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.960
Thanks for calling Ting.

35:08.960 --> 35:10.020
This is Isabelle speaking.

35:10.020 --> 35:11.020
How can I help you?

35:11.020 --> 35:13.860
Hello?

35:13.860 --> 35:15.320
Thanks for calling Ting.

35:15.320 --> 35:17.140
This is Isabelle speaking.

35:17.140 --> 35:17.980
How can I?

35:17.980 --> 35:20.980
Hey, this is Isabelle at Ting.

35:20.980 --> 35:23.980
For service in English, press one.

35:23.980 --> 35:27.980
Para el servicio en espanol, presione dos.

35:27.980 --> 35:30.980
To talk about phones, press one.

35:30.980 --> 35:35.980
To talk about something else, press two.

35:35.980 --> 35:37.980
To speak to an operator, press zero.

35:37.980 --> 35:40.980
Please hold while we direct your call

35:40.980 --> 35:42.980
to the first available agent.

35:42.980 --> 35:43.980
Your time is up.

35:43.980 --> 35:47.980
Please hold while we direct your call to the first available agent.

35:47.980 --> 35:48.980
Your time is important to us.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.980
Thank you for your patience.

35:54.980 --> 35:56.980
I assume they include this in all of their training videos.

35:59.980 --> 36:00.980
That's what the people want.

36:02.980 --> 36:04.980
Thanks for calling Ting.

36:04.980 --> 36:05.980
This is Isabelle speaking.

36:05.980 --> 36:06.980
How can I help you?

36:06.980 --> 36:07.980
Oh, wow.

36:07.980 --> 36:08.980
That was quick.

36:10.980 --> 36:11.980
That's really good.

36:11.980 --> 36:13.980
Linux.ting.com, so they have really great customer service.

36:13.980 --> 36:15.980
They have a super good dashboard to manage all this.

36:15.980 --> 36:16.980
And I don't know if I mentioned it yet,

36:16.980 --> 36:19.980
they also have CDMA and GSM services.

36:19.980 --> 36:20.980
That is the most exciting part right there.

36:20.980 --> 36:23.980
And then no locked devices, no contracts,

36:23.980 --> 36:24.980
no determination fee.

36:24.980 --> 36:26.980
I think this is super nice,

36:26.980 --> 36:28.980
because if you want to go really high-end phones,

36:28.980 --> 36:31.980
and it's one that after you use it for a bit,

36:31.980 --> 36:33.980
you want to be able to hand it down to somebody

36:33.980 --> 36:34.980
or give it to somebody else,

36:34.980 --> 36:37.980
this kind of structure makes the continued viability

36:37.980 --> 36:39.980
of a phone like that last way longer

36:39.980 --> 36:41.980
than these quote-unquote agreements you get in now

36:41.980 --> 36:42.980
with the carriers.

36:42.980 --> 36:43.980
Oh, man.

36:43.980 --> 36:45.980
And it's way easier to understand.

36:45.980 --> 36:46.980
Yes.

36:46.980 --> 36:47.980
And then on the other spectrum,

36:47.980 --> 36:49.980
it's really easy to do like the budget value phones.

36:49.980 --> 36:52.980
They just did a blog post for what they call 5 Whys,

36:52.980 --> 36:54.980
smartphone choices for less than $200.

36:54.980 --> 36:58.980
And they have the list broken out here on their blog.

36:58.980 --> 37:01.980
I feel like the Blue Life 1X

37:01.980 --> 37:03.980
probably doesn't get enough discussion.

37:03.980 --> 37:05.980
It's got a 5.2-inch 1080p IPS display

37:05.980 --> 37:08.980
with a 424-pixel density, which is actually...

37:08.980 --> 37:09.980
That is not bad.

37:09.980 --> 37:10.980
...pretty high-end, yeah.

37:10.980 --> 37:13.980
It's got Gorilla Glass 3 scratch resistance, too,

37:13.980 --> 37:16.980
which is not bad, and a decent camera on it,

37:16.980 --> 37:20.980
and it's got full GSM 12-band compatibility.

37:20.980 --> 37:21.980
And it's $158.

37:21.980 --> 37:23.980
No contract, no determination fee.

37:23.980 --> 37:25.980
I almost kind of want that just as like a backup phone

37:25.980 --> 37:26.980
in case I break my bank, right?

37:26.980 --> 37:27.980
Yeah, and $6 for the line.

37:27.980 --> 37:28.980
Yeah, that's great.

37:28.980 --> 37:29.980
And then just your usage.

37:29.980 --> 37:30.980
You just pay for your usage.

37:30.980 --> 37:32.980
Check them out, linux.ting.com,

37:32.980 --> 37:33.980
and a big thank you to Ting

37:33.980 --> 37:35.980
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

37:35.980 --> 37:37.980
You've got to go to linux.ting.com to get the discount

37:37.980 --> 37:38.980
and to support the show.

37:38.980 --> 37:40.980
And thank you, everybody, for doing that,

37:40.980 --> 37:41.980
and thanks to Ting for sponsoring us.

37:41.980 --> 37:43.980
Holy moly.

37:43.980 --> 37:47.980
You know, I did just purchase myself a Pixel.

37:47.980 --> 37:48.980
Ah, you did it.

37:48.980 --> 37:50.980
You know, I think it'll be running on Ting.

37:50.980 --> 37:52.980
Now, did you...so you did the play, or did you...

37:52.980 --> 37:53.980
How did you...did you do that, yeah?

37:53.980 --> 37:54.980
Yep, yep.

37:54.980 --> 37:55.980
I bought it right from Google.

37:55.980 --> 37:56.980
Really?

37:56.980 --> 37:57.980
Yep, and one for the wife.

37:57.980 --> 37:58.980
Oh, man, I can't...oh, really?

37:58.980 --> 37:59.980
Yeah, and she's going...

37:59.980 --> 38:00.980
She's moving from iOS.

38:00.980 --> 38:01.980
Wow.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.980
So that'll be an interesting story as it develops.

38:03.980 --> 38:05.980
I'll be really curious to hear your feedback

38:05.980 --> 38:08.980
on User Air 7, which will come out probably pretty soon.

38:08.980 --> 38:09.980
We talking about the Pixel in there?

38:09.980 --> 38:11.980
Yeah, Swizz putting his marriage on the line there.

38:11.980 --> 38:12.980
Yeah, right?

38:12.980 --> 38:13.980
Well, hey, that was her idea.

38:13.980 --> 38:14.980
Really?

38:14.980 --> 38:15.980
Yes.

38:15.980 --> 38:16.980
What pushed her over?

38:16.980 --> 38:17.980
Well, I mean, her current iPhone has, like,

38:17.980 --> 38:19.980
damaged screen kind of a little bit.

38:19.980 --> 38:21.980
It's not bad, but it's, like, she was ready for a new phone.

38:21.980 --> 38:22.980
What version of iPhone is it?

38:22.980 --> 38:23.980
But she wasn't...iPhone 6.

38:23.980 --> 38:24.980
So she...oh, okay.

38:24.980 --> 38:25.980
I mean, it wasn't a bad phone at all,

38:25.980 --> 38:27.980
but she just didn't seem interested in the 7,

38:27.980 --> 38:29.980
and she, like, looked at it, and she was like, okay.

38:29.980 --> 38:30.980
Yeah, yeah.

38:30.980 --> 38:31.980
Yeah, I think...

38:31.980 --> 38:32.980
The first thing she said was, like,

38:32.980 --> 38:35.980
it looks like an iPhone, so it's probably this...

38:35.980 --> 38:36.980
Specifically an iPhone 6, actually.

38:36.980 --> 38:37.980
Exactly.

38:37.980 --> 38:38.980
With a really tacky two-tone back.

38:38.980 --> 38:39.980
But other than that...

38:39.980 --> 38:40.980
Other than that.

38:40.980 --> 38:43.980
I actually am really curious to hear what you think about the shape,

38:43.980 --> 38:45.980
because I think I'm really going to dig that wedge shape.

38:45.980 --> 38:46.980
I know, I think I am, too.

38:46.980 --> 38:47.980
It's kind of sexy.

38:47.980 --> 38:49.980
Yeah, and it's going to probably feel good on the table.

38:49.980 --> 38:51.980
So I'll be leaving vicariously through you.

38:51.980 --> 38:55.980
Mr. Wimpy, you don't happen to have, oh, I don't know,

38:55.980 --> 38:57.980
an Ubuntu Touch device still, do you?

38:57.980 --> 38:59.980
I do, several.

38:59.980 --> 39:03.980
And now I've been negligent in checking in with you over the last few weeks.

39:03.980 --> 39:05.980
I think we've had, like, a three-week break.

39:05.980 --> 39:10.980
But how has, so far, your Ubuntu phone experience gone?

39:10.980 --> 39:13.980
Popi switched his main driver over...

39:13.980 --> 39:15.980
Or Popi, I'm sorry, Wimpy.

39:15.980 --> 39:16.980
I'm sure Popi has, too, actually.

39:16.980 --> 39:17.980
I think that's why.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.980
Wimpy switched his main driver...

39:19.980 --> 39:21.980
You don't use it as your main phone?

39:21.980 --> 39:22.980
No.

39:22.980 --> 39:24.980
What?

39:24.980 --> 39:25.980
Okay, well, I want to hear about that, too.

39:25.980 --> 39:27.980
But let me get back to Wimpy for a second.

39:27.980 --> 39:31.980
So Wimpy switched his main driver over to Ubuntu Touch.

39:31.980 --> 39:34.980
And one of the big areas I wanted to hear about from Wimpy was, like,

39:34.980 --> 39:37.980
how does it work with managing podcasts and doing your audio in the car?

39:37.980 --> 39:38.980
Because that's a big, big function for me and the phone.

39:38.980 --> 39:39.980
Agreed.

39:39.980 --> 39:40.980
So, Wimpy, it's been a few weeks.

39:40.980 --> 39:41.980
I've been negligent.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.980
I'm kind of curious why you are...

39:44.980 --> 39:45.980
I'm kind of curious how it's gone.

39:45.980 --> 39:48.980
And then I'll get to Popi and find out why he hasn't been using it.

39:48.980 --> 39:51.980
But how is your experience so far the last few weeks since we've chatted?

39:51.980 --> 39:56.980
So in terms of all of the, you know, doing the social network stuff

39:56.980 --> 39:59.980
and email and looking up websites and all of that sort of thing,

39:59.980 --> 40:00.980
that's all just fine.

40:00.980 --> 40:03.980
Is that mostly native apps or is that web apps?

40:03.980 --> 40:04.980
A mixture.

40:04.980 --> 40:05.980
Yeah, okay.

40:05.980 --> 40:06.980
Yeah, it depends what it is.

40:06.980 --> 40:08.980
There's, like, a native app for Reddit.

40:08.980 --> 40:12.980
There's native apps for some things and wrapped web apps.

40:12.980 --> 40:16.980
But what's happening now is that those wrapped web apps

40:16.980 --> 40:21.980
are starting to have native elements embedded within them.

40:21.980 --> 40:26.980
So it's still a web app, but it's got more of the native controls

40:26.980 --> 40:28.980
integrated with the web experience.

40:28.980 --> 40:32.980
So that's noticeable in things like some of the new Twitter apps

40:32.980 --> 40:37.980
and the Google Plus apps and things like that.

40:37.980 --> 40:41.980
So Google Plus, are they doing something specifically to enable that

40:41.980 --> 40:45.980
in their web app or is this a new feature of the...

40:45.980 --> 40:51.980
Yeah, so the developers of these apps are embedding their own controls

40:51.980 --> 40:55.980
that exercise parts of Google Plus to make it feel more like

40:55.980 --> 40:57.980
a native application.

40:57.980 --> 40:58.980
That's nice to see.

40:58.980 --> 40:59.980
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

40:59.980 --> 41:02.980
The new Google Plus app I'm using is very good.

41:02.980 --> 41:05.980
So it sounds like the ecosystem is really not doing badly at all.

41:05.980 --> 41:08.980
It's kind of coming together right before your very eyes.

41:08.980 --> 41:09.980
It is.

41:09.980 --> 41:12.980
You know, it's slowly, things are improving.

41:12.980 --> 41:17.980
Although to your earlier question, if your use case is podcasting

41:17.980 --> 41:21.980
in the car, I can't recommend it.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.980
How come?

41:23.980 --> 41:31.980
The Bluetooth is not reliable enough and the native podcasting app

41:31.980 --> 41:35.980
is not reliable enough at the moment.

41:35.980 --> 41:40.980
So I'm still using my Pocket Cast web app to do my podcast listening.

41:40.980 --> 41:43.980
And you're just wiring it in?

41:43.980 --> 41:48.980
Well, I've had a change in circumstances so I don't need to have it work

41:48.980 --> 41:49.980
with the car anymore.

41:49.980 --> 41:51.980
I just need to get this.

41:51.980 --> 41:52.980
I'm a bit old-fashioned.

41:52.980 --> 41:56.980
I plug headphones into my phone in order to listen to things.

41:56.980 --> 41:57.980
Headphones, I'm not familiar with that.

41:57.980 --> 41:58.980
Is that a new thing?

41:58.980 --> 41:59.980
Yeah.

41:59.980 --> 42:02.980
No, it's an old thing that's going out of fashion fast apparently.

42:02.980 --> 42:03.980
Apparently.

42:03.980 --> 42:04.980
Haven't you heard about lightning already?

42:04.980 --> 42:05.980
Come on.

42:05.980 --> 42:09.980
So how about the really boring stuff like long-term performance?

42:09.980 --> 42:14.980
Is it staying fairly consistent and battery life?

42:14.980 --> 42:18.980
So battery life, it comfortably lasts me a day.

42:18.980 --> 42:25.980
Although my podcast wrapper for Pocket Casts has to force keep the screen

42:25.980 --> 42:28.980
on to ensure that the podcast keeps playing.

42:28.980 --> 42:32.980
So obviously you're going to take a battery hit if you do lots of that

42:32.980 --> 42:34.980
without charging in between.

42:34.980 --> 42:36.980
But if you're not doing that sort of thing,

42:36.980 --> 42:39.980
I always have Bluetooth enabled.

42:39.980 --> 42:45.980
I have it paired with my two Pebble watches and it's always connected to

42:45.980 --> 42:49.980
Wi-Fi and 4G and it comfortably lasts the day.

42:49.980 --> 42:52.980
You know, more than comfortably lasts the day.

42:52.980 --> 42:53.980
That's wonderful.

42:53.980 --> 42:57.980
So no regrets overall?

42:57.980 --> 42:58.980
No regrets.

42:58.980 --> 43:00.980
I'm pleased I've done it.

43:00.980 --> 43:03.980
I've certainly seen sort of the rough edges,

43:03.980 --> 43:07.980
but I went into this knowing that I was going to encounter rough edges

43:07.980 --> 43:12.980
and that I wanted to help to identify them and solve them.

43:12.980 --> 43:14.980
So, you know, that's what I'm doing.

43:14.980 --> 43:15.980
Yeah.

43:15.980 --> 43:16.980
I have a question.

43:16.980 --> 43:17.980
Something that seems interesting,

43:17.980 --> 43:20.980
like we've talked a lot about it as like a replacement platform rendering.

43:20.980 --> 43:23.980
I'm just curious, how much do you use the fact that it's, you know,

43:23.980 --> 43:26.980
a little bit more like desktop Linux?

43:26.980 --> 43:29.980
Do you do things on the Ubuntu system that might require root on Android

43:29.980 --> 43:35.980
or might require weird workarounds on Android that are easier on the Ubuntu system?

43:35.980 --> 43:36.980
Not really.

43:36.980 --> 43:41.980
The only thing I do is on the tablet, I do have that connected.

43:41.980 --> 43:47.980
So I've got the wireless screen dongle for one of the screens upstairs and downstairs.

43:47.980 --> 43:52.980
And I do use the tablet to cast the screen to those.

43:52.980 --> 43:58.980
And on the phone, I do that occasionally, mostly for the fun factor.

43:58.980 --> 44:02.980
But the terminal experience is, you know,

44:02.980 --> 44:07.980
much more Linux than anything and the other devices.

44:07.980 --> 44:09.980
So I do use that from time to time.

44:09.980 --> 44:11.980
That's really quite good.

44:11.980 --> 44:12.980
That's great.

44:12.980 --> 44:19.980
So the enthusiast in me kind of wishes I just had an extra phone to mess around with right now.

44:19.980 --> 44:21.980
That's kind of where I'm at with this.

44:21.980 --> 44:23.980
So thank you for letting me pick your brain on that.

44:23.980 --> 44:26.980
Wendy, don't go far because I want to talk about a few other things here in a second.

44:26.980 --> 44:31.980
But I cannot go any further right now without taking a moment and asking Poby.

44:31.980 --> 44:33.980
I secretly use Arch Linux.

44:33.980 --> 44:38.980
Poby, out of anybody in the Mumble Room that I thought would be using Ubuntu on their phone as their daily driver,

44:38.980 --> 44:43.980
I just incorrectly assumed it would be you.

44:43.980 --> 44:45.980
I'm kind of curious maybe why you don't.

44:45.980 --> 44:51.980
And I hope the answer is not for competitive research because that feels like a cop-out.

44:51.980 --> 44:52.980
Don't say it.

44:52.980 --> 44:58.980
So I have on my desk a Pro5 running Ubuntu.

44:58.980 --> 45:01.980
It's always right here on my desk and I do daily updates.

45:01.980 --> 45:04.980
And I use my Pro5 for podcasting.

45:04.980 --> 45:07.980
So I use the native podcast app, Podbird.

45:07.980 --> 45:12.980
I don't know if I just don't experience the same bugs as Martin does,

45:12.980 --> 45:20.980
but it seems to work OK for me for like just playing a show and like playing whatever most recent things I want.

45:20.980 --> 45:27.980
I don't use it as my daily driver mainly – well, for two main reasons.

45:27.980 --> 45:34.980
One, I have banking apps and other things that they just aren't available on.

45:34.980 --> 45:35.980
I do have that problem too.

45:35.980 --> 45:38.980
My bank has an app.

45:38.980 --> 45:41.980
I can make my own apps for that.

45:41.980 --> 45:45.980
I have a bank – there's also an app for my kids' bank as well.

45:45.980 --> 45:52.980
So we have this whole pocket money thing where the kids can earn money and it's managed through a phone app.

45:52.980 --> 45:53.980
And that's –

45:53.980 --> 45:54.980
I now want to be one of your kids.

45:54.980 --> 45:55.980
Yeah.

45:55.980 --> 45:56.980
How do we get on that list?

45:56.980 --> 45:57.980
You don't – oh, man, I'm cracking the whip.

45:57.980 --> 46:01.980
I'll send you down the mine or the chimney or something.

46:01.980 --> 46:02.980
So you probably don't want to do that.

46:02.980 --> 46:03.980
Oh, OK.

46:03.980 --> 46:04.980
I'll trade you some panels.

46:04.980 --> 46:10.980
And that's – well, the only other one is WhatsApp for a couple of people,

46:10.980 --> 46:12.980
but not many people I talk to on WhatsApp.

46:12.980 --> 46:20.980
But yeah, it really is just a few key apps that I can't use on a Ubuntu phone really.

46:20.980 --> 46:22.980
That's the killer.

46:22.980 --> 46:23.980
It is always on.

46:23.980 --> 46:24.980
It's always sat here.

46:24.980 --> 46:27.980
I'm always carrying it with me, but it's not the one that's got my SIM in it.

46:27.980 --> 46:30.980
So if you phone me, it will be my Android phone that rings.

46:30.980 --> 46:31.980
It won't be the –

46:31.980 --> 46:36.980
So rumor has it you'll be traveling in November to a canonical event.

46:36.980 --> 46:41.980
Would that be something where you might maybe bring an Ubuntu touch phone with you for that thing?

46:41.980 --> 46:43.980
Or do you still bring a different phone?

46:43.980 --> 46:45.980
I carry multiple phones everywhere I go.

46:45.980 --> 46:48.980
I used to be there.

46:48.980 --> 46:55.980
Sometimes when we go – there's a UK Ubuntu group where we have –

46:55.980 --> 47:00.980
we meet up every year and go on a train where they sell – it's an old steam train –

47:00.980 --> 47:02.980
where they sell beer on the train.

47:02.980 --> 47:03.980
All right. OK.

47:03.980 --> 47:04.980
We call it the beer train.

47:04.980 --> 47:07.980
It's called the real ale train, right?

47:07.980 --> 47:09.980
And we all go on there and drink beer.

47:09.980 --> 47:17.980
But there's a couple of games that we play on Android and on iOS, which you need a wireless network.

47:17.980 --> 47:25.980
And I pull out my trusty BQE 4.5 and turn on hotspot, and everyone connects to my Ubuntu phone.

47:25.980 --> 47:29.980
And we're all playing with the Ubuntu phone being my wireless access point.

47:29.980 --> 47:35.980
So it has some uses that I just wouldn't – I wouldn't have another device with me that was battery powered

47:35.980 --> 47:38.980
that was a wireless access point that I could just pull out my bag and turn that on and use it.

47:38.980 --> 47:41.980
So I use it for some weird niche things.

47:41.980 --> 47:44.980
It's just not necessarily the one that will ring if you phone me.

47:44.980 --> 47:45.980
Interesting.

47:45.980 --> 47:46.980
Yeah.

47:46.980 --> 47:47.980
I've definitely done that for a while too.

47:47.980 --> 47:52.980
I've had phones that are either for testing or when I had – for a long time I had a Blackberry for work.

47:52.980 --> 47:53.980
Chris, that's insane.

47:53.980 --> 47:55.980
The other thing is the camera.

47:55.980 --> 47:58.980
The camera app isn't fantastic.

47:58.980 --> 48:00.980
It's missing some features.

48:00.980 --> 48:06.980
And I take a fair number of photos of my kids and my cats, of course, and other nonsense.

48:06.980 --> 48:09.980
And I need a reliable camera app to do that.

48:09.980 --> 48:18.980
I don't want to be that guy in five years' time who doesn't have photos of his kids because he was religiously tied to one phone.

48:18.980 --> 48:19.980
Oh, yeah.

48:19.980 --> 48:20.980
That would be hard.

48:20.980 --> 48:21.980
Yeah, yeah.

48:21.980 --> 48:24.980
That would be a tough thing to live with.

48:24.980 --> 48:29.980
But, I mean, if you're the reason the Ubuntu phone became the next big thing, maybe it's worth it.

48:29.980 --> 48:30.980
Maybe.

48:30.980 --> 48:31.980
Okay.

48:31.980 --> 48:32.980
This is a good pick.

48:32.980 --> 48:34.980
I can't see myself running it.

48:34.980 --> 48:37.980
That's not a price I'm willing to pay.

48:37.980 --> 48:42.980
So let's talk about – let's just talk about the elephant that's been in the room.

48:42.980 --> 48:43.980
There is –

48:43.980 --> 48:44.980
It's a really pretty elephant.

48:44.980 --> 48:45.980
Yeah.

48:45.980 --> 48:52.980
There is a trend where I think a lot of times in open source something gets forked.

48:52.980 --> 48:57.980
And we almost have a visceral immediate reaction to laugh it off.

48:57.980 --> 48:58.980
Now every now and then there's exceptions.

48:58.980 --> 49:01.980
I don't know if that necessarily happened when Nextcloud forked, for example.

49:01.980 --> 49:09.980
But most of the time I think if you had heard that the GNOME project has moved on and declared

49:09.980 --> 49:13.980
that GNOME 2 is old and busted and that in order to have a desktop of the future it must

49:13.980 --> 49:18.980
be left behind and a bunch of neckbeards came along and said, well, this will not stand.

49:18.980 --> 49:23.980
We're going to fork this GNOME 2 GTK2 desktop and we're going to keep it alive.

49:23.980 --> 49:25.980
I think a lot of people would have looked at that.

49:25.980 --> 49:28.980
I mean, if you remove everything that's happened in the last few years and if you just – you

49:28.980 --> 49:33.980
looked at that concept in its just raw naked form, I think a lot of people would say, that's

49:33.980 --> 49:34.980
ridiculous.

49:34.980 --> 49:37.980
Once again, open source is splitting its resources.

49:37.980 --> 49:38.980
Nobody's focusing on the right thing.

49:38.980 --> 49:40.980
People are going off to their different camps.

49:40.980 --> 49:42.980
And it would be a laughable idea.

49:42.980 --> 49:45.980
Why would you take this old desktop paradigm that's old and busted that obviously needs

49:45.980 --> 49:50.980
to be replaced, which is, again, a bunch of assumptions being made, and try to fork it?

49:50.980 --> 49:51.980
That's a waste of everybody's time.

49:51.980 --> 50:00.980
But yet, here we are, 2016, and I think the Mate desktop is one of the most relevant desktops

50:00.980 --> 50:02.980
in the Linux landscape.

50:02.980 --> 50:05.980
I think it's one of the most widely used Linux desktops.

50:05.980 --> 50:10.980
It's had, thanks to the Raspberry Pi, a huge surge on lower-end hardware.

50:10.980 --> 50:11.980
Massive deployment.

50:11.980 --> 50:16.980
It's made a lot of us – since its launch now, a lot of us go, why do people run XFCE again?

50:16.980 --> 50:18.980
I mean, it's literally taken that spot.

50:18.980 --> 50:19.980
Very well said.

50:19.980 --> 50:26.980
It's about, I believe, I believe it is currently transitioning into a totally different stage.

50:26.980 --> 50:31.980
And I think you're going to see a lot of it very soon.

50:31.980 --> 50:35.980
You could probably start beginning to play with a lot of it when Ubuntu 16.10 Mate edition

50:35.980 --> 50:36.980
ships.

50:36.980 --> 50:37.980
I'll let Wimpy talk about that.

50:37.980 --> 50:39.980
I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I think this will probably be a chance for

50:39.980 --> 50:40.980
you to get to see a lot of this.

50:40.980 --> 50:47.980
There's some big things that are coming, including what seems to be essentially a from-scratch

50:47.980 --> 50:51.980
reworking of Ubuntu Mate to go to GTK 3.

50:51.980 --> 50:56.980
I mean, this is taking a desktop that was designed around a traditional desktop paradigm

50:56.980 --> 51:01.980
in technology and moving it to be completely technologically compatible with the latest

51:01.980 --> 51:07.980
Linux desktop, at least for GTK 3, while keeping an existing work paradigm that obviously tens

51:07.980 --> 51:10.980
of millions of users prefer.

51:10.980 --> 51:11.980
Isn't that a fascinating thing?

51:11.980 --> 51:14.980
You know, clearly there was a – when it was created, there was clearly this community

51:14.980 --> 51:17.980
of people that said, like, well, wait, this is still working for us.

51:17.980 --> 51:19.980
So it's very interesting to watch it evolve.

51:19.980 --> 51:21.980
Because at first it almost felt like a stick-in-the-mud position.

51:21.980 --> 51:25.980
Yeah, you know, like anachronism almost, but functional.

51:25.980 --> 51:29.980
But clearly they're very interested in taking on new technical things.

51:29.980 --> 51:32.980
It's just that there's also things they want to keep and refine.

51:32.980 --> 51:41.980
It is almost – it is almost so obvious in retrospect that I think we've almost missed

51:41.980 --> 51:43.980
what an interesting transition this is.

51:43.980 --> 51:47.980
And so I think there's a couple of things happening here.

51:47.980 --> 51:53.980
There's work happening upstream with Mate itself that's impacting any distro that can run it.

51:53.980 --> 51:56.980
And then there's a lot of work specifically going into Ubuntu Mate.

51:56.980 --> 52:01.980
And so before I put too many of the wrong concepts out there, I want to just make sure

52:01.980 --> 52:05.980
that I don't say anything more before I go to Wimpy and say, Wimpy, can you kind of enlighten

52:05.980 --> 52:10.980
us as what's going on with this GTK 3 transition and why does it matter to end users?

52:10.980 --> 52:13.980
And then could you eventually get to where we can end up seeing it?

52:13.980 --> 52:14.980
OK.

52:14.980 --> 52:16.980
It's a long way now.

52:16.980 --> 52:21.980
Yeah, so Mate was obviously forked from GNOME 2 using the GTK 2 toolkit,

52:21.980 --> 52:23.980
and it's been that way for a long, long time.

52:23.980 --> 52:31.980
And behind the scenes, GTK 3 support has been added, and we were getting very close.

52:31.980 --> 52:41.980
And after the 1604 release, I really wanted to shift to GTK 3 because I felt we needed

52:41.980 --> 52:43.980
to make that jump.

52:43.980 --> 52:46.980
Otherwise, we'd procrastinate and sit on it for longer.

52:46.980 --> 52:57.980
And so I spoke with the Debian maintainer and the Fedora maintainer back in March, April time.

52:57.980 --> 53:06.980
And we agreed a timeline that suited all three distributions to make the jump to a

53:06.980 --> 53:12.980
Mate GTK 3 implementation so that we could all roll together with that.

53:12.980 --> 53:18.980
Well, in fact, Debian unstable is actually the first to benefit.

53:18.980 --> 53:25.980
So Debian unstable got the full Mate 1.16 built against GTK 3 at the weekend.

53:25.980 --> 53:38.980
It landed in Ubuntu 1610 archives on Monday, and it's in Fedora, what will be Fedora 25.

53:38.980 --> 53:42.980
So those are three major distributions that are doing that.

53:42.980 --> 53:49.980
And then you've also got the hot and sexy new independent distros like Solus,

53:49.980 --> 53:56.980
who when they go shopping for an alternative desktop environment spot that Mate is now GTK 3

53:56.980 --> 53:59.980
and it's using modern technologies and it's underpinning.

53:59.980 --> 54:04.980
Why does that matter to me, Wimpy, as Fedora or as Solus?

54:04.980 --> 54:08.980
Why do I care if it's GTK 3 versus GTK 2?

54:08.980 --> 54:17.980
Well, the main reason that you want GTK 3 is because it's the gateway to even more newer technologies.

54:17.980 --> 54:23.980
Things like high DPI and eventually things like Wayland and Mia.

54:23.980 --> 54:31.980
And isn't that sort of maybe the most important thing to note is high DPI and Wayland are not possible otherwise?

54:31.980 --> 54:35.980
I mean, how else can you accomplish it with GTK 2? Is there any possibility?

54:35.980 --> 54:43.980
Not really. I mean, you can do font scaling and things, but generally speaking, no, it's not really there in GTK 2.

54:43.980 --> 54:48.980
And there's a whole raft of other reasons, but it's not just GTK 3.

54:48.980 --> 54:55.980
You know, along the way, it's all the other technologies that have since been phased out or are being phased out

54:55.980 --> 55:02.980
that Mate has been adopting in order to keep it current and relevant so that it moves with the latest technologies.

55:02.980 --> 55:10.980
So, you know, Mate looks like GNOME 2 always did, even now with the GTK 3 implementation.

55:10.980 --> 55:18.980
In my opinion, it looks a little bit more polished because we've got some niceties from GTK 3 that weren't there in GTK 2.

55:18.980 --> 55:22.980
But it looks and works exactly like it did with GTK 2.

55:22.980 --> 55:27.980
And that's quite a nifty achievement, I think.

55:27.980 --> 55:38.980
Because what people miss is that the Mate team are preserving our desktop cultural heritage by sticking with this project.

55:38.980 --> 55:46.980
It's not particularly glamorous to continually maintain a project that is effectively complete.

55:46.980 --> 55:52.980
You know, because the objective of the project has been completed.

55:52.980 --> 55:56.980
We're just making sure it continues to work and it continues.

55:56.980 --> 55:57.980
Okay, so that's interesting.

55:57.980 --> 56:10.980
So are you saying, in a sense, by keeping Mate relevant in terms of like the GTK – by moving GTK 3,

56:10.980 --> 56:16.980
supporting things like Wayland and high DPI, but keeping the basic workflow the same,

56:16.980 --> 56:24.980
it sort of is the best way to pay respect and tribute and keep that workflow and that paradigm alive.

56:24.980 --> 56:28.980
Not to enshrine it in like glass and never change it.

56:28.980 --> 56:29.980
It's a living document, right?

56:29.980 --> 56:31.980
Keep it going, keep it living.

56:31.980 --> 56:33.980
Yeah, exactly.

56:33.980 --> 56:46.980
And the thing is that that paradigm that GNOME 2 used, it is built on good design principles that still stand today.

56:46.980 --> 56:50.980
There are different ways that you can interact with computing devices.

56:50.980 --> 57:04.980
And the way that that user interaction works in GNOME 2 and now Mate is well tested, well thought and has years of work behind it.

57:04.980 --> 57:11.980
So it doesn't mean it should be thrown out just because it's an old idea.

57:11.980 --> 57:17.980
After all, we're using operating systems that are based on old ideas that came up within the 60s and 70s.

57:17.980 --> 57:20.980
Just because it's an old idea doesn't mean it's a bad idea.

57:20.980 --> 57:26.980
The other thing I think of when I think of GNOME 2 and Mate is I think of low resources,

57:26.980 --> 57:29.980
low memory footprint, low CPU overhead, low GPU requirements.

57:29.980 --> 57:36.980
Is there a way to honor that and make it still appealing to low end devices like Raspberry Pis,

57:36.980 --> 57:40.980
but still keep it modern with GTK 3 and those things?

57:40.980 --> 57:42.980
That's a little more challenging now.

57:42.980 --> 57:48.980
There's some additional memory overhead with using GTK 3 as opposed to GTK 2.

57:48.980 --> 57:53.980
Certainly it's targeting the Raspberry Pi 3 is still possible.

57:53.980 --> 57:55.980
That's not an issue.

57:55.980 --> 58:03.980
But in terms of Ubuntu Mate, which has got a lot of additional scaffolding around it because it's got, you know,

58:03.980 --> 58:13.980
full accessibility stack and a whole load of other bits and pieces in the 1704 cycle, I'm going to put some thought into

58:13.980 --> 58:23.980
how we can retain the rich feature set, but rein in some of that excess in memory consumption,

58:23.980 --> 58:27.980
but without compromising the user experience.

58:27.980 --> 58:30.980
So that's going to be a goal for 1704.

58:30.980 --> 58:35.980
Interesting. And 1610 is what? Next week, if everything goes?

58:35.980 --> 58:37.980
Two days. Two days from now.

58:37.980 --> 58:38.980
Two days?

58:38.980 --> 58:39.980
The 13th. Yeah.

58:39.980 --> 58:44.980
Oh, OK. Wow. I should get it installed and start kicking the tires and see how it goes.

58:44.980 --> 58:51.980
If you go to the CD image, are you familiar with cdimage.ubuntu.com?

58:51.980 --> 58:53.980
Yeah, you can get the daily live from there.

58:53.980 --> 59:00.980
If you get the Ubuntu Mate daily live, which is built today, that is our release candidate.

59:00.980 --> 59:08.980
And I'm really hoping that that won't change, that that is the version that will be the final version.

59:08.980 --> 59:12.980
I am downloading it right now. Very cool.

59:12.980 --> 59:19.980
Yeah, I have been looking forward to trying out the 1610 release because I usually jump in earlier.

59:19.980 --> 59:23.980
But this time I decided since there wasn't like a feature that I was just freaking out about,

59:23.980 --> 59:26.980
I would wait till the release candidate stage. So I'm ready to jump in.

59:26.980 --> 59:29.980
I will also toss a link in the show notes. So there we go.

59:29.980 --> 59:35.980
Well, interesting, Wimpy. And so I guess kind of zooming out a few levels

59:35.980 --> 59:39.980
and kind of getting back to an overall theme that we've had this episode.

59:39.980 --> 59:44.980
This to me seems like we've recently had a huge burst, even more so in the last few years.

59:44.980 --> 59:48.980
But really just honestly, if you look at the last six to seven, eight months,

59:48.980 --> 59:54.980
it feels like there's been a massive burst in development in Mate, which is benefiting a lot of distros.

59:54.980 --> 01:00:02.980
You mentioned Fedora. But also, I think it's obvious that it's going to benefit Ubuntu Mate as well.

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.980
And so there's been work that's getting done.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:09.980
And I think part of it is probably thanks to a form of crowdfunding that you've been doing

01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:13.980
over at the Ubuntu Mate project, like you mentioned earlier, a blending of crowdfunding.

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:18.980
And I gather you're devoting some of this funding towards the development.

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:25.980
And I'm kind of curious if you could kind of just recap how that works for the audience and really like,

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:31.980
why not just hire somebody over at, why not take some of these funds you're raising

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:35.980
and just hire somebody to sit there and work on this stuff full time for you?

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:39.980
Well, you can do that. You can hire people.

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:46.980
And that is still a Patreon goal for Ubuntu Mate, if we get to a specific funding level,

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:50.980
we'll have somebody work full time on it. That's an aspiration.

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:56.980
But in getting there, I've actually found that you can get an awful lot of good momentum

01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:03.980
by breaking down small projects and handing off small projects to individuals

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:06.980
and funding these discrete pockets of work.

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:15.980
And during the 1610 development cycle, so that's been running from basically the beginning of May

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:25.980
until the end of October, the Ubuntu Mate crowdfunding has paid out about $6,200

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:32.980
to open source developers to work specifically on Mate desktop and Ubuntu Mate projects.

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:37.980
And that has made a massive difference to the project momentum

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:47.980
because I was originally planning to complete this transition to GTK3 at the end of the 1704 cycle.

01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:49.980
End of 1704?

01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:52.980
At the end of 1704, which is in June next year.

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:54.980
So you're a little ahead of schedule.

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:56.980
We're six months ahead of schedule.

01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:02.980
So I planned that for a year we would just do that transition to GTK3

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:06.980
and all the other bits that we needed to port to GTK3.

01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:11.980
But all of that work has been done and all of it has been funded

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:15.980
from the investment that the Ubuntu Mate project gets.

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:18.980
And also I key noticed I'm using the word investment.

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:23.980
I read what you wrote about that and I've changed all the language I use on the Ubuntu Mate website

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.980
and what I say to say investment rather than donate,

01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:31.980
which is a little hat tip to Ikey and some sensible thinking that he shared.

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.980
That is really smart.

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:35.980
Because it really is an investment.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:38.980
It is and it's not technically a donation because it's not tax deductible.

01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:43.980
So that's a really good use of the word.

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:45.980
And it hasn't been an investment, hasn't it?

01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:49.980
Because now look, that's a huge leap ahead in the schedule there.

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:55.980
Yeah, so what we're going to focus on now for Ubuntu Mate specifically.

01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:04.980
In the 1704 cycle, Ubuntu Mate is just going to be about bug fixes, refinement and polish.

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:10.980
Not going to concentrate on bringing in new features and expanding the scope of the project.

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:18.980
Just make what we've achieved in this 1610 cycle move into GTK3 more reliable, more robust

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:23.980
more stable and true to the origins of the project.

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:26.980
So that's what 1704 is going to be.

01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:32.980
So a bit of a yawner by comparison, but I think important work that we have now afforded the time to do.

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:38.980
And I've been setting up with some of the core Mate developers.

01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:47.980
We're going to do some bounty source type funding to expand the scope of this project sponsorship.

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:55.980
And I'm hoping that we'll be able to invest even more money in independent developers and open source developers

01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.980
that are interested in working on Mate and Ubuntu Mate over the next six months.

01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:04.980
See that puts you in a very cool place where at least some of your funding comes from this community Patreon angle

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.980
and then you kind of get to help shepherd it and then through bounty source or other things

01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:14.980
then kind of give back to the community in a way where the whole thing is self supporting and growing.

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:23.980
And when I post our monthly summaries, I explain who the developers are that have received money

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:30.980
how much they've received, what they worked on and I also put their distro affiliation

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:38.980
and you'll notice in there that there are people from Debian, people from Fedora, people from OpenSUSE

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:50.980
and the most recent open, let's say, open content creator that has been rewarded through that program is Rotten

01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:53.980
who's done some work for us just recently.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:55.980
And also from Drupal Broadcasting.

01:04:55.980 --> 01:05:02.980
Yeah, and I'll give you an insight what Rotten's been working on is retouching some image assets

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:07.980
which are our first baby steps to high DPI support.

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:08.980
That's awesome.

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:09.980
That is, oh man.

01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:10.980
Good man, Rotten.

01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:11.980
Mr. Tonell.

01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:12.980
Mr. Tonell.

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:13.980
I now call him.

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:20.980
So that's, Wimpy, that's a huge amount of progress and I say good on you for taking 1704 release cycle

01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:26.980
and tightening it up because let's be honest, the expectation with the Ubuntu Batte distribution

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:32.980
isn't going to be rapid, crazy, revolutionary change every single release.

01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:36.980
There's going to be a certain point where people just want something that works really well to be refined

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:40.980
and refined and refined and I look forward to the process and watching that.

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:45.980
So I'm obviously going to have to try out 1610, obviously.

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:49.980
Before we get off of 1610 completely, I know RMH, you had something I wanted to get to

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:52.980
but I think I'll take it in the post-show because we're running long.

01:05:52.980 --> 01:06:00.980
But I did want to put a feeler out there and I'm kind of hoping you guys can help set my expectation

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:08.980
for Unity 8 on 1610 because I know one of the headline features is Unity 8 will be available as an optional session

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:14.980
and I'm kind of curious how I should set my expectations during the review process.

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:22.980
I have a feeling I should set them low but I also don't want to just set them so low that anything's fine.

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:28.980
I don't know where this should be at so I would love to hear both Popey and Wimpy's thoughts

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:31.980
and anybody else's thoughts on it. Popey, can I start with you and say what do you know about this

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:35.980
and have you tried it and what do you think I should set my expectations towards?

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:43.980
I haven't tried it yet. I'm only running 1604 here so for anyone who wants to try the Unity 8 session

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:46.980
it will be an option in 1610, not the default.

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:49.980
Now do I have to have Intel hardware for it to work?

01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:56.980
Intel or the Nouveau video driver on Nvidia. I've not tried AMD because I haven't touched AMD for years.

01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:08.980
It also works in KVM, QEMU and VMware Fusion. I don't think it works in VirtualBox but it works in KVM, QEMU.

01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:12.980
It doesn't work in VirtualBox or with the Nvidia proprietary drivers yet

01:07:12.980 --> 01:07:17.980
but I have seen that people are actively working on that right now.

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:20.980
So in terms of expectations...

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:24.980
And apps too. What do you think? Include the apps I might try.

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:31.980
So I think the default is just going to be pretty much the same apps that are available on the phone, the default apps.

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:37.980
So the same, the Ubuntu web browser, calendar clock, calculator, terminal, those kind of like the basic apps.

01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:39.980
No, not that much.

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:40.980
Oh really?

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:45.980
Yeah, it's the basic session is what you're going to get.

01:07:45.980 --> 01:07:49.980
So I'm testing at the moment the 1610 image behind me

01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:58.980
and the pre-installed apps that you'll have are the settings, the browser and the terminal.

01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:03.980
And one other thing I can't remember without moving across the office and looking.

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:06.980
I'm going to have a launcher, right? I'm going to have a launcher.

01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:09.980
Yeah, and the launcher. So fairly minimal.

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:17.980
But I'm expecting that you'll find that there'll be some documentation coming along fairly soon after the release

01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:24.980
that will explain how to install more of the Unity 8 apps and what have you.

01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:32.980
I'm wondering, should I, can I expect my Xapps to work? Will Xmere be a thing that's functional?

01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:38.980
Yeah, but you'll need to install some things. So there's a technology called Libertine.

01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:48.980
You'll need to install Libertine and Libertine Scope or Scope Libertine. I forget which way around the name of the packages.

01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:55.980
Once you've installed that through the Libertine manager, which will appear in the app launcher,

01:08:55.980 --> 01:09:00.980
you can create a container and it does that for you.

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:11.980
You just give it a name and once you've created your container, you can then install Debs into that container through a UI.

01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:17.980
So if you know that you want HexChat, you just type in when it says, what do you want to install?

01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:27.980
You just type HexChat in, hit enter. It installs that into the container and adds an icon to your desktop apps scope.

01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:30.980
And you'll be able to launch HexChat and that will open.

01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:38.980
And for example, today I've installed Chromium just fine and HexChat and LibreOffice and all of those sorts of things.

01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:48.980
So the functions to do that stuff exist and through Libertine, you can also enable third party repositories and PPAs.

01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:53.980
So I haven't tested this yet, but I was going to have a go a bit later is, you know,

01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:58.980
getting things like Google Chrome and Steam running to see if I can get those going up inside Exmere.

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:02.980
But so far, everything I've tried works just fine.

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:09.980
And that's what I'm using to sort of get my traditional desktop applications.

01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:12.980
What exactly is Libertine specifically?

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:16.980
Libertine itself is a container. Is it a Chirrut?

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:25.980
It creates Lexd containers and then launches those applications and binds them to Exmere.

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:27.980
Sounds like a snap.

01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:30.980
Almost. Not quite.

01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:33.980
So you can create many containers.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:43.980
So you could create one container for each application or you could create one container and install lots of different applications inside it.

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:47.980
Oh, OK. So it's sort of like a bottle in a sense.

01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:48.980
Yeah.

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:51.980
And an interface to help bind it to the system.

01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:57.980
Yeah. And then, of course, you've got snaps as well because underneath it's just up into 1610.

01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:59.980
So you can snap install bits and pieces.

01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:06.980
So if there are snaps out there that are using Mia, then, you know, they will work.

01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:14.980
Interesting. And I think I'm going to kick the tires, but I suspect it probably won't be the main driver for me.

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:22.980
This is the first steps. It's not by any means the full Unity 8 desktop experience.

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:26.980
So that means it's 1610, though, is shipping with Exmere.

01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:30.980
So they're both in there and they're both usable if you have an open source driver.

01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:31.980
Yep.

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:32.980
Hey, that's cool.

01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:38.980
Yeah. So, boy, isn't that interesting? Fedora's got Wayland in 25 and 1610 has got Mir.

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:41.980
And I don't – it's not like the two were like competing with each other.

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:42.980
It's just sort of how it worked out.

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:44.980
It's just how it worked out, yeah.

01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:46.980
Maybe we'll have to compare them side by side.

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:51.980
Oh, Wes, I love that idea. We should totally try it out.

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:55.980
Just see, because we have a couple of Intel rigs around here with the open source driver.

01:11:55.980 --> 01:12:00.980
And I think that Bonobo right there is like in the sweet spot with the Novu driver.

01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:03.980
So that might be a way to go.

01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:07.980
Well, I'll report back and see how it goes.

01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:08.980
Right.

01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:13.980
We'll see. That'll be part of the review, but not the review, I suspect.

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:16.980
Now, before we go any further, I do want to play the interview that we had for you.

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:19.980
And I want to mention Linux Academy for making the rest of the show possible.

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:22.980
Go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:26.980
Go there to learn about a platform built by Linux enthusiasts, educators, and developers

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:28.980
that came together and said, let's help spread Linux.

01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:31.980
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged is where you go to support this show.

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.980
And now with a new seven-day free trial.

01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:35.980
Oh, woo. Oh, boy.

01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:38.980
A seven-day free trial, which means no risk.

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:39.980
Get in there, try it out.

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:40.980
Google be addicted.

01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:42.980
Go wrap your head around something.

01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:44.980
They've got these quick starts, too, if you don't have a lot of time.

01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:45.980
You can go deep dive into something.

01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:48.980
And of course, if you ever get stuck, instructor mentoring is available.

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:52.980
And I love their video courses, because not only are they self-paced, in-depth courses,

01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:56.980
but you can download and take their comprehensive study guides and bring them with you.

01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:58.980
And they have everything. It's like, you know, you prefer the long-form articles.

01:12:58.980 --> 01:12:59.980
You prefer videos.

01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:00.980
They have everything you might need.

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:04.980
And the community is growing like crazy, stacked full of Jupyter broadcasting members.

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.980
And speaking of the community, they now have external profiles.

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:11.980
This is big, because not only is Linux Academy going up in stature,

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:13.980
so just linking to Linux Academy looks good on your resume,

01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:17.980
but now you can actually visually demonstrate in a public way what you've accomplished,

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:21.980
which is great if you have a current employer that's helping you with your training.

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.980
Yep. Or you need to prove that you've got the skills for that new promotion.

01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:25.980
This is brilliant.

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:28.980
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged is where you go.

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:30.980
And check out their video they have posted over there, too.

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:35.980
Whether you're an experienced sysadmin or new to the world of Linux, Azure and AWS,

01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:40.980
OpenStack and DevOps, a sharp skill set is an absolute necessity to succeed.

01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:44.980
Meet Linux Academy, an online Linux and cloud training platform

01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:48.980
that uses self-paced video courses and hands-on labs

01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:52.980
to give you real-world experience for a wide range of skills.

01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:56.980
Train for your certification, learn the latest DevOps tools,

01:13:56.980 --> 01:13:58.980
and grow your skill set to do better work.

01:13:58.980 --> 01:14:01.980
Linux Academy is not just a video library.

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:06.980
Our scenario-based server labs and quiz system allow you to learn hands-on.

01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:09.980
We also have full-time human instructors who answer questions

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:13.980
and help you earn that certification or promotion at work.

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:17.980
We add new training every week so you'll always be up to date on the latest tech.

01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:24.980
Sysadmins of every experience level use Linux Academy to stay on the bleeding edge of the Linux ecosystem.

01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:26.980
You should, too.

01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:30.980
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged now with a seven-day free trial.

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:34.980
And by the way, if you're going to be at Compute Midwest, go say hi to Linux Academy.

01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:36.980
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:40.980
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program.

01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:45.980
And a big un-thank you to my neighbor for mowing the lawn right in the middle of an ad read.

01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:47.980
This is lup time. Everyone knows that.

01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:50.980
I mean, even what's crazy, too, is I think...

01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:53.980
You need like an outside the studio, like an on-air light.

01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:54.980
Yeah, right.

01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.980
It wouldn't do anything, but it'd be very cool.

01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:59.980
Now, answer me this. Are you not sitting inside a soundproof insulated room?

01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:03.980
Yes, I absolutely am. Is this the world's loudest lawnmower?

01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:06.980
This is an intense amount of soundproofing in here. There is an intense amount.

01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:10.980
All right. So that's neither here nor there. We need to move on.

01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:14.980
I could do a whole podcast on why lawnmowers are the evil thing ever.

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:18.980
But I want to talk about our friend Andy from InnoCybe.

01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:21.980
Wes and I had a chat to chance with Andy.

01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:26.980
And InnoCybe is a pure play Open Daylight partner.

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:27.980
They're going all in on Open Daylight.

01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:28.980
They seem like one of the leaders.

01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:33.980
Yeah. And their story is a fascinating one.

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:35.980
I have a couple of clips from the interview.

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:41.980
I want to start with how by contributing upstream to Open Daylight,

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:46.980
by closing bugs, by fixing little things here, by submitting patches,

01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:50.980
they ended up getting leads, and they ended up getting contracts and making money.

01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:55.980
And I thought that was sort of a fascinating answer to the question that we often ask,

01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:58.980
how do you make money with something that's free? How do you make money with open source?

01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:00.980
And so this is a little insight into that.

01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:07.980
People typically will find out about InnoCybe because they see our names

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:12.980
on the committers lists of the different projects, and then if they need help with an ODL project,

01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:15.980
then they typically call us.

01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:19.980
And so I would say that now people have definitely gone beyond the POC stage,

01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:22.980
the proof of concept stage, and they're deploying real things in production.

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:25.980
And that's why we help them do that with our platform,

01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:30.980
get them to a commercial grade type of production deployment really quickly.

01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:32.980
So that's a really interesting thing there.

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:37.980
So you're picking up some customers because they're seeing the commits,

01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:39.980
and they're seeing the names on the commits, and they're saying,

01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:43.980
look at this work they're doing here. I want to work with them. I want to pick their brains.

01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:46.980
And then that's one of the ways the business relationship gets established?

01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:52.980
That's exactly right. I mean, ODL is similar to other large open source projects

01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:57.980
in that it's very powerful and flexible, and there's a lot of things you can do with it.

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.980
And then one of the negative things of that is it's really powerful and flexible,

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:04.980
and there's a lot you can do with it. So you can get yourself in trouble pretty quickly.

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:09.980
And so we help people stay out of trouble and kind of stay between the guardrails

01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:14.980
of what works, what doesn't work, what project is going to be useful for their specific use case.

01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:18.980
And we're sort of their lifeline into ODL.

01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:24.980
So they're able to sort of make money around this open platform from a contributing standpoint.

01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:29.980
And I wondered then, once that transforms into a client,

01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:34.980
what is really their main value? And you were kind of getting at this question too when we were there.

01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:38.980
You're like, how do you add value since Open Daylight is an open platform,

01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:41.980
the documentation is all out there, anyone can use it.

01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:44.980
Why do you need to pay contractors, third-party companies?

01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:50.980
Yeah, why am I hiring you? And this is probably true for all major open source projects, is the answer.

01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:52.980
I thought this was a good one.

01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:57.980
Great question. So I'd say one thing that's really common is because it's open source

01:17:57.980 --> 01:18:04.980
and it's sort of enticingly easy to get started, you can start down a wrong path.

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:11.980
And not necessarily a wrong path, but it's just that what you're creating might be great for a lab environment.

01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.980
You need to understand how to really scale it.

01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:20.980
Yeah, for scaling and getting into production and making sure it's a very robust solution

01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:26.980
that is not going to fail in corner cases, that sort of thing, that requires a different approach.

01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:31.980
And so when you're looking at things from a professional quality type of thing,

01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:40.980
that's often where we see that if we can get involved sooner, it's better to shorten the path to production quality.

01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:46.980
It was nice of Andy to chat with us and get an insight in how a company can make a decent living

01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:48.980
by supporting an open source project.

01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:50.980
Which then goes right back and supports that platform.

01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:53.980
The more people that are making money on it, the healthier future it'll have.

01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:58.980
So there's a lot of different ways, and somehow, there's a lot of different ways to crack this particular egg.

01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:02.980
And I just realized that they have eggs on there.

01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:06.980
And then I just sort of realized why they have – I was trying to – like as I said,

01:19:06.980 --> 01:19:08.980
I was like, why do they have a cracked egg on there?

01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:10.980
Ah, because the omelet reference.

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:15.980
Yeah, there's a lot of ways to make an omelet between Patreon, direct funding, Bitcoin,

01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:18.980
and commercial contracts and sponsorships.

01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:22.980
And somehow, by the time we get to the end of this episode, we had a theme.

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:25.980
We ended up with a freaking theme on the Unplugged show that was totally unplanned,

01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:27.980
but yet somehow magically worked out.

01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:28.980
Unplugged.

01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:32.980
Yeah, that'd be – wow, that's actually – that could be like our slogan was.

01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:33.980
Yeah, right?

01:19:33.980 --> 01:19:34.980
Let's go with that.

01:19:34.980 --> 01:19:38.980
Well, so thank you for listening to this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:39.980
Thank you to Andy for coming on.

01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:42.980
Thank you to Ike for letting us chat in the cone of silence.

01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:44.980
Sorry that didn't make it into the rest of the show for everybody else.

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:49.980
And of course, thank you to Mr. Wimpy for chatting with us and for Mr. Popey for letting me pick his brain today.

01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:52.980
I thought that was good to see him again. I hadn't been talking to him.

01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:54.980
And to the rest of our wonderful Mumble Room.

01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:56.980
Just one of those things.

01:19:56.980 --> 01:19:58.980
Love those guys so much in that Mumble Room. All of them.

01:19:58.980 --> 01:19:59.980
Thank you, guys.

01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:01.980
All of them. Let's chat more, guys. Let's do it more.

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:03.980
Come back maybe next week.

01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:05.980
We could even have a post-show.

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:07.980
Oh, that's a great idea. Let's try that.

01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.980
Okay, everybody, thanks for tuning in to this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:10.980
See you next week.

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:20.980
And don't forget to tune in live at jimmylive.tv.

01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:46.980
All right, jimmytitles.com.

01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:48.980
jimmytitles.com.

01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:50.980
All right, thank you, everybody. Thank you.

01:20:50.980 --> 01:20:52.980
That was a lot of fun.

01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:54.980
Mumble Room, I love you. You're fantastic.

01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:58.980
Now, I wanted to go to RMH, though, because he had something during the show that I wanted to punt to the post-show.

01:20:58.980 --> 01:21:02.980
So, I forgot what your point was, sir, but the floor is yours.

01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:04.980
Yeah, thanks.

01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:10.980
Basically, what I was saying is that there are a lot of people in the service industry like Noah,

01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:20.980
and I'm getting started with my own enterprise, and we are all just using this open source software

01:21:20.980 --> 01:21:29.980
mainly because it's free for the customer, so no licensing stuff, and we get regular updates and things like that.

01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:40.980
And in my business plan, I actually have 10% of my income dedicated to giving back to the community.

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:48.980
Whatever I'm using most or deploying most for that month, I try to give back what I earned.

01:21:48.980 --> 01:22:00.980
And I think it's pretty important that we who use the software that gets created for free for us, for use, that we give back.

01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:02.980
Yeah, that's great.

01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:04.980
That is. Good on you.

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:08.980
We've been experimenting more and more here with giving back to open source.

01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:11.980
It's been a mixed bag for us.

01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:17.980
I mean, good, but people usually take the code we use, and then they create something that competes with us,

01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:19.980
so that's when I was like, well, okay.

01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.980
But at the same time –

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:22.980
That's part and parcel, right?

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:23.980
Yeah, exactly.

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:28.980
So Linux Winter Developments and Vintage GTK3 are all towards the top.

01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:30.980
I like Linux Winter Developments.

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:33.980
I think that must be a reference back to Popeye's beer.

01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:35.980
How is that going, Popeye?

01:22:35.980 --> 01:22:36.980
All gone.

01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:37.980
Excellent work.

01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:41.980
I'm on my last vanilla cream right now.

01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:42.980
So there you go.

01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:47.980
Good on you, gentlemen, for both of you for recording double episodes and then still making it.

01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:48.980
Thank you very much.

01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:49.980
That is a lot.

01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:52.980
I don't think we'll be around next week because we're both –

01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:53.980
Traveling.

01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:55.980
Yeah.

01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:56.980
Wow, already?

01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:58.980
No, not traveling next week.

01:22:58.980 --> 01:22:59.980
What's next week?

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:00.980
There's the sprint.

01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:01.980
Oh, it is.

01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:02.980
I thought that was in –

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:03.980
We have a sprint in the Netherlands.

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:04.980
Oh, that is.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:05.980
Yep, yep, yep.

01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:06.980
So –

01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:07.980
We will miss you.

01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:10.980
Yeah, we will, but I'd kind of love to know how that goes.

01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:13.980
And aren't you guys having some press there this time or some bloggers or something?

01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:16.980
So there might actually be coverage during the event.

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:17.980
Is that right?

01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:22.980
There's going to be some community people invited, and we encourage them to blog about

01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:23.980
their experience and talk about stuff.

01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:24.980
Good, great.

01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:29.980
There's someone from the elementary project with some KDE people and, yeah, various people

01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:30.980
going.

01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:31.980
Excellent.

01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:33.980
Be sure to bring your score on the 40-yard dash.

01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:37.980
Is that the first time you guys have done that?

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:38.980
No.

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:40.980
We have one in Heidelberg a couple of months ago.

01:23:40.980 --> 01:23:42.980
So that was at the Snap one?

01:23:42.980 --> 01:23:43.980
July.

01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:44.980
Yeah.

01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:45.980
And this is another Snap one, Snappy Sprint.

01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:47.980
I mean, but there's going to be a whole load of other people.

01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:50.980
But specifically people that are in the press or like in blogs are going to be there, not

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:51.980
just –

01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:55.980
No, I don't think we've got journalists, but we're encouraging those people who are

01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:56.980
there to share their experience.

01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:57.980
To blog.

01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:58.980
Oh, okay.

01:23:58.980 --> 01:23:59.980
Good.

01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:00.980
Yeah.

01:24:00.980 --> 01:24:01.980
Yeah.

01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:04.220
I thought the stuff that came out of the Snap Sprint was like the most information I'd

01:24:04.220 --> 01:24:07.100
ever seen out of an event like that.

01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:11.500
And it was a super good one for that to happen because it was a bunch of different projects

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:14.180
coming together to work on Snap packages.

01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:15.180
So it seemed like –

01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:17.820
That's really an inflection point for the community there.

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:21.740
And you know, some companies are very clever.

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:25.420
They intentionally bring like favored bloggers along to blog about it so that way they get

01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:26.420
great coverage.

01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:28.620
And I kind of thought maybe you guys are going that direction.

01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:33.160
But also I kind of like the idea of just saying, no, just the people that attend, please do

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.160
blog about it.

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.160
Please share what you've done here.

01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.160
Because –

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:42.300
It does feel like – to some people, they probably don't even know that this isn't

01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:46.020
like the second time you've ever done this.

01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:48.760
I think some people don't know that you guys get together and do this from time to time

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:49.760
at all.

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:50.760
I mean, it's not the second one you've ever done, right?

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.760
Yeah.

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:52.940
No, we do sprints all the time.

01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:53.940
Exactly.

01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:57.100
There's like – I think there's five in a row in that one venue.

01:24:57.100 --> 01:24:58.100
Right.

01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:00.700
There's one right now and then we're joining next week and so on.

01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:06.300
Do you see why that is an important thing for the general Linux user base to know that

01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:07.300
even happens?

01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:12.200
Because it shows an output of canonicals, money, and resources to further development

01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:14.940
of their platform and it brings different people together.

01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:19.420
That seems like something that I would be bragging about a lot more –

01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:20.420
Right.

01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:24.740
I realize it's to further your own goals and to work on stuff.

01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:29.660
But at the same time, it seems like a perfect opportunity to brag about some of the progress

01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:31.940
and work that's being done and the outreach that happens.

01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:34.600
So I don't understand why it doesn't get better coverage.

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.900
So I mean, it can be quite intense.

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.820
There's a whole load of sessions over the week.

01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:44.860
We schedule like a tightly packed one hour to two hour sessions throughout the week.

01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:49.760
It's quite an intense amount of work that gets done and then that gets decompressed

01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:52.660
at the end of the week and some announcements come out of that.

01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:54.500
Maybe some press comes out of it.

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:59.140
But we rely on the people coming to blog about it because people have different perspectives

01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:01.500
and people join different sessions.

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:07.340
So you know, I might be in one session about Snap upstream related stuff and then Martin

01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:10.420
will be in something related to desktop apps.

01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:14.180
And so if we both blogged about it, you'd get a different perspective from either of

01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:18.060
us, which is why we encourage everyone who goes to blog about it because we get multiple

01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:22.060
perspectives with each person coming from their own project as well.

01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:26.380
Although I would argue – I mean, that's absolutely the way to do that.

01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:31.500
But I would argue that it's not enough because really the only time that gets any reasonable

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:36.180
dissemination is if a larger outlet then picks up that developer's blog and covers it on

01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:37.180
their medium.

01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:38.180
And –

01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:39.180
Right.

01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:40.180
But it depends.

01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:41.180
It depends how interesting that content is.

01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:42.180
If it was like –

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:43.180
Sure.

01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:44.180
Yeah.

01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:45.180
We sat in a room and –

01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:46.180
Right.

01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:47.180
And figured out some API or something.

01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:48.180
Nobody gives a toss about that.

01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:55.020
But unless it's like inside baseball, it's not interesting unless there's some big decision.

01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:58.820
Maybe if there was an upstream there who said, okay, we're fully committing to this and

01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:00.820
we're going to deliver all of our apps or something like that.

01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:01.820
Yeah, for sure.

01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:06.940
Although I kind of still disagree because you look at the Open Daylight Summit.

01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:12.100
That was pretty much just what you described and we've still got like three plus weeks

01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:19.660
of content out of it and they got quite a bit of exposure out of it because for me,

01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:22.320
I wouldn't be the one going to the Sprint event.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:28.020
But if I were going to the Sprint event to cover the development, I would build a story

01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:32.300
around the people that are there and the work that's getting done, not the decisions that

01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:33.300
were made.

01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:35.540
So I think it just depends on the outlet.

01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:37.700
I mean I know that's – but you've got work to do.

01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:40.500
I guess my point is it's just there's a lot of good damn work getting done and it's

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:41.500
not getting enough attention.

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:42.500
Exactly.

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:43.500
And I just wish we could solve that problem.

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:48.740
And it's also not remaining popular developers that have blogs in the sense of like a big

01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:53.340
time developer who also keeps track of stuff they do on a blog and most of the time they

01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:56.500
maybe make one blog a year or something like that.

01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:59.820
And so no one's paying attention to it so there's no traction.

01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:04.860
So yeah, they might blog about it but if the vast majority of people aren't looking then

01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:11.980
it doesn't really matter because if Canonical just did it where they just asked every blogger

01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:15.580
to do it and if they did submit like an email and then they just made an aggregate page,

01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:18.160
like here's all the blogs about it, check them out, that would be good.

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:21.820
Like planet.abuntu.com for example, that's where you can find it.

01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:22.820
Right.

01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:23.820
But most people don't even use that.

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:24.820
Yeah.

01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:29.300
I mean your best bet is Softpedia picks it up or Chris notices it and things like that.

01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:31.380
I mean that's really kind of your best bet.

01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:36.140
And the only reason I think I get a little righteous, just like 5% righteous about it

01:28:36.140 --> 01:28:40.480
is when I get a whiff of an injustice I start to get a little worked up.

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:47.980
And so the injustice that I see here is – the perfect lens to look at this is just the absolute

01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:53.860
talking points bullshit that came out after Snap packages were announced.

01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:56.620
People couldn't get – first of all, people that weren't involved with it couldn't get

01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:57.620
the terminology right.

01:28:57.620 --> 01:29:00.800
They attacked Canonical for not working with the community.

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:06.340
Just all of the typical talking points that roll out when a Canonical initiative is announced

01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:14.900
and I honestly feel like the work that gets done at some of these events would be a – so

01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:18.940
it would be a visceral demonstration that goes against that narrative.

01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:19.940
Right.

01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:22.300
And it's like even if you don't agree with this like the people are doing real work and

01:29:22.300 --> 01:29:24.500
there's momentum and a community behind it.

01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:27.900
I'll speak to my PR people, Chris.

01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:28.900
I'm sure.

01:29:28.900 --> 01:29:29.900
