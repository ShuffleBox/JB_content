WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.500
As we approach the 21st century, a new means of communication is emerging.

00:14.500 --> 00:21.940
This technology uses computer networks to link people on every continent.

00:21.940 --> 00:30.400
If we are destined to live in a global village, one day we will all be connected to the internet.

00:30.400 --> 00:45.880
This is Linux Unplugged episode 292.

00:45.880 --> 00:50.680
Welcome into Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's in a hot box this week.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.240
Getting ready for some podcasting.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.240
My name is Chris.

00:53.240 --> 00:54.240
My name is Wes.

00:54.240 --> 00:59.160
Hello, Mr. Payne, and joining us in studio this weekend is Mr. Cheese Bacon.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.160
Hello, Cheese.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.160
Hey, how's it going?

01:01.160 --> 01:02.160
Nice to finally be here.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.160
It is.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.160
Nice to have you here, I mean.

01:04.160 --> 01:09.880
Well, and it's always been unplugged, which has always been not central time, which has

01:09.880 --> 01:11.920
always been when I've been at work.

01:11.920 --> 01:12.920
Hey, that's true.

01:12.920 --> 01:13.920
That's true.

01:13.920 --> 01:14.920
So that's a thing.

01:14.920 --> 01:15.920
Now you can actually be here live, finally.

01:15.920 --> 01:19.360
Coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged program, we're going to look back at a couple

01:19.360 --> 01:25.960
of big milestones, including one from Mozilla, one for the web, and NGINX being sold for

01:25.960 --> 01:33.800
$670 million, plus Sway hits 1.0, and then we look at some leadership challenges facing

01:33.800 --> 01:35.040
the Debian project.

01:35.040 --> 01:40.880
And then later on in the show, myself, Wes, and El will join and get in here, talk about

01:40.880 --> 01:41.880
scale.

01:41.880 --> 01:42.880
We're going to get into scale.

01:42.880 --> 01:47.160
We're going to tell you how 17X went, what we took away from it, and a few stories.

01:47.160 --> 01:50.480
And then after all of that, we get to some of those emails.

01:50.480 --> 01:54.640
Finally, after what has been ages on the show, we'll answer a few emails that came in.

01:54.640 --> 01:55.640
We'll see how many we get to.

01:55.640 --> 01:56.640
Yeah, right.

01:56.640 --> 01:57.640
I should say that.

01:57.640 --> 01:58.640
It's not that we're not looking.

01:58.640 --> 02:01.400
There's just so much to talk about that we have to make time for feedback segments.

02:01.400 --> 02:02.400
No, we read it.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.200
We totally read it.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.600
But this week, we're going to try to include some of it, depending on how long the scale

02:06.600 --> 02:09.040
stories go, because then we have a hard out by the network.

02:09.040 --> 02:10.040
No, I'm kidding.

02:10.040 --> 02:12.000
It's just we try to keep it like an hour and change.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.800
But before we go any further, let's bring in that mumble room.

02:14.800 --> 02:15.800
Time appropriate.

02:15.800 --> 02:16.800
Greetings, mumble room.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.800
Hello.

02:17.800 --> 02:18.800
Hello.

02:18.800 --> 02:19.800
All right.

02:19.800 --> 02:20.800
All right.

02:20.800 --> 02:21.800
Hello.

02:21.800 --> 02:22.800
Hi, there.

02:22.800 --> 02:23.800
Hello.

02:23.800 --> 02:24.800
And I hear Elle in there, too.

02:24.800 --> 02:25.800
Hello, Elle.

02:25.800 --> 02:26.800
Hello, hello.

02:26.800 --> 02:27.800
Hello, hello.

02:27.800 --> 02:28.800
So we're starting today.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.800
And there's one thing that always plagues this episode.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.880
This is always the episode where the time zone math messes with everybody's head.

02:31.880 --> 02:35.960
So like a good chunk of our virtual lug can't make it because it's like a totally different

02:35.960 --> 02:36.960
time for them.

02:36.960 --> 02:37.960
Oh, yeah.

02:37.960 --> 02:38.960
I didn't even think time change.

02:38.960 --> 02:41.340
It's easier to just join and be here all day.

02:41.340 --> 02:42.640
And that way, you know, you won't miss it.

02:42.640 --> 02:46.200
It's easier if we just don't have time change savings.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.200
I know.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.200
Right.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.200
Wouldn't that be like way easier?

02:49.200 --> 02:50.200
Yeah.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.200
You would think.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.200
Yeah.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.200
I don't understand why they don't do that.

02:53.200 --> 02:57.320
Well, anyways, as you probably heard there in the intro, we have a bit of a milestone.

02:57.320 --> 03:06.280
It is at least if you're to believe the hype, the Web's birthday today, the Web turns 30

03:06.280 --> 03:07.280
years old today.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.540
It's also Linux Academy's birthday.

03:08.540 --> 03:09.640
So that's kind of cool.

03:09.640 --> 03:10.800
Two things.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.120
Two great things happening today.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.120
Those were planned.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.120
Maybe.

03:14.120 --> 03:20.520
You know, I think that's something worth maybe asking Anthony for sure.

03:20.520 --> 03:23.520
There's a bunch of different a bunch of different things going online, though, to celebrate

03:23.520 --> 03:30.160
the anniversary of Tim Berners-Lee proposal back in 1989 of March to put together.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.160
What did he call it?

03:31.160 --> 03:32.840
He didn't call it the World Wide Web back then, did he, Wes?

03:32.840 --> 03:35.080
He called it like an information proposal or something.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.240
Yeah, basically.

03:36.240 --> 03:40.600
And vague but interesting, I think, is what his boss described it as, which I mean, like

03:40.600 --> 03:44.400
all good ideas.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.400
Yeah.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.400
OK.

03:46.400 --> 03:50.740
Amazon, Google and others have been submitting like old versions of their Web sites to Twitter

03:50.740 --> 03:51.740
to celebrate the day.

03:51.740 --> 03:56.080
We have a link in the show notes that is actually really cool to see, like the old Amazon dot

03:56.080 --> 03:57.080
com.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.320
Welcome to the Amazon bookstore.

03:59.320 --> 04:02.640
We still shipping books from this garage, right?

04:02.640 --> 04:03.640
That's pretty great, though.

04:03.640 --> 04:06.200
It makes me feel a little old and nostalgic at the same time.

04:06.200 --> 04:10.880
It seems about as usable as some of their current pages.

04:10.880 --> 04:11.880
Wow.

04:11.880 --> 04:12.880
Wow.

04:12.880 --> 04:13.880
Savage, Wes.

04:13.880 --> 04:14.880
Savage.

04:14.880 --> 04:15.880
So savage.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.400
And actually kind of in a way would I wouldn't mind it.

04:17.400 --> 04:19.740
They sell too many things to organize it in that old way.

04:19.740 --> 04:23.920
But if they could have individual pages like that for for different categories, it might

04:23.920 --> 04:24.920
actually work.

04:24.920 --> 04:26.280
So I don't know.

04:26.280 --> 04:32.240
This is kind of this is a rough anniversary estimate because it's it's today technically

04:32.240 --> 04:36.480
because Tim Berners-Lee is going back to CERN to celebrate today, even though it was really

04:36.480 --> 04:37.480
in the month of March.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.240
And do we call that a birthday?

04:39.240 --> 04:40.240
I guess we can call that a birthday.

04:40.240 --> 04:44.120
I mean, as long as we can all just be grateful that we wouldn't be here talking without any

04:44.120 --> 04:47.460
of these inventions and the hard work over the years and the fact that so many of us

04:47.460 --> 04:49.840
have jobs that wouldn't have exist without it.

04:49.840 --> 04:50.840
It's deep, Wes.

04:50.840 --> 04:51.840
It's so deep.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.480
Mozilla is celebrating and giving the Web a birthday present today.

04:54.480 --> 05:00.560
They're moving their send service out of testing to an actual full fledged service.

05:00.560 --> 05:04.480
If you're not familiar, send is a free encrypted file transfer service that allows users to

05:04.480 --> 05:07.120
safely and simply share files from any browser.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.900
It doesn't have to be just Firefox.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.120
And now it's a keeper.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.280
And so they're upping the upload limit and giving some more controls.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.400
Looks like it's a full fledged service now.

05:15.400 --> 05:20.160
I was a little confused because I saw like announcing I was like, this this already existed.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.920
But yeah, everyone kind of forgot about it.

05:21.920 --> 05:25.800
It's always been useful this entire time, especially since it's end to end encrypted.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.860
And honestly, they've thought a lot about some of the UX here.

05:28.860 --> 05:32.280
There's some command line tools that interface with their system, reasonable limits.

05:32.280 --> 05:36.540
You get a gig free 2.5 gigs if you have a free Firefox account.

05:36.540 --> 05:40.760
And you know, you can set it to either expire on the number of downloads or time based or

05:40.760 --> 05:41.760
both.

05:41.760 --> 05:42.760
Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.400
And an Android app is apparently in beta.

05:45.400 --> 05:46.400
Oh, yeah.

05:46.400 --> 05:50.040
It's gonna be coming down the pipeline to which I think, obviously, mobile first everything

05:50.040 --> 05:51.040
these days.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.040
Right?

05:52.040 --> 05:53.040
Sure.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.040
Yeah.

05:54.040 --> 05:57.800
Send is a really simple way for the recipient to get the file to because they don't have

05:57.800 --> 05:58.800
to set up an account.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.800
They just can use any web browser and just download the file.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.460
And the end to end encryption means that even if it's stored on Mozilla servers, they're

06:04.460 --> 06:05.640
not reading it.

06:05.640 --> 06:07.660
So that's nice to see them take this out.

06:07.660 --> 06:11.240
Sometimes these test pilot programs don't get taken out and at a test pilot, they just

06:11.240 --> 06:12.240
sort of fade away.

06:12.240 --> 06:16.380
Well, I think what's really cool about it, too, is that in encryption, I mean, this is

06:16.380 --> 06:21.880
something my mother could use and her files would be encrypted when she sends them to

06:21.880 --> 06:23.240
my aunt or whatever.

06:23.240 --> 06:28.080
And she doesn't even need to know anything about encryption or you know, it's just it's

06:28.080 --> 06:29.080
built in.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.080
Here it is.

06:30.080 --> 06:31.080
Go with it.

06:31.080 --> 06:35.840
You know, I think it's cool for Mozilla to to spin up that sort of technology and just

06:35.840 --> 06:36.840
forever.

06:36.840 --> 06:37.840
Right?

06:37.840 --> 06:38.840
It's PGP.

06:38.840 --> 06:39.840
What?

06:39.840 --> 06:40.840
Yeah.

06:40.840 --> 06:41.840
Oh, for sure.

06:41.840 --> 06:42.840
Right.

06:42.840 --> 06:43.840
And so you can think about tax time.

06:43.840 --> 06:44.840
Yeah.

06:44.840 --> 06:45.840
Tax season.

06:45.840 --> 06:46.840
Absolutely.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.740
I can tell you right now it's like either it all gets sent in my email or I get sent

06:48.740 --> 06:51.960
off to links to like DocuSign or other services.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.400
And it's kind of a mess.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.400
It's a hodgepodge.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.800
Always, always seems to be for sure.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.360
Well, Mr. Cheese Bacon, that's who you're hearing right there.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.400
He's here in studio with me.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.400
This is the Texas studio.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.240
What do you think of the old Texas studio, man?

07:05.240 --> 07:06.240
It's nice.

07:06.240 --> 07:07.240
I mean, I can't compare it.

07:07.240 --> 07:08.240
You sound a little skeptical here.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.800
Or is it just because your new boss is right next to you in his studio?

07:10.800 --> 07:12.600
Well, I mean, that's that's a thing, too.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.600
But right.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.600
I haven't seen the other studios.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.600
Right.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.600
So I can only.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.560
I'm just going for like, you know, this is just like, you know, a podcast studio.

07:18.560 --> 07:19.560
I like it.

07:19.560 --> 07:20.560
I like it.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.560
I mean, I like this.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.080
This the swanky lounge chairs.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.080
Yeah.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.080
Yeah.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.080
I want people to be comfortable.

07:26.080 --> 07:27.080
I want people to be comfortable with all the things.

07:27.080 --> 07:32.160
And I think the only thing that doesn't have an acoustic foam light switches.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.160
Yep.

07:33.160 --> 07:34.160
Which there is a recording light.

07:34.160 --> 07:35.160
Right.

07:35.160 --> 07:37.120
So light switches don't have acoustic foam.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.120
Mm hmm.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.120
That's about it.

07:39.120 --> 07:40.120
Receptacles.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.120
Yeah.

07:41.120 --> 07:44.240
I've got like five or six Wi-Fi bulbs in here doing different colors and stuff.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.240
It's pretty great.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.240
It is.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.240
It is nice.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.240
It gives a nice ambiance.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.240
It gets warm, though.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.240
Yeah.

07:50.240 --> 07:52.800
So Cheese Bacon has officially joined our team.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.600
Yeah, I'm super excited about it, man.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.480
This is a dream come true for me.

07:58.480 --> 08:02.480
I think a lot of people in the community, you know, I'm sure they've seen me on IRC.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.560
Oh yeah, you've been around for ages.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.560
Through all of the...

08:05.560 --> 08:06.560
How many years have you been in the community?

08:06.560 --> 08:07.800
At least a decade.

08:07.800 --> 08:08.800
That's amazing.

08:08.800 --> 08:09.800
At least a decade.

08:09.800 --> 08:10.800
Yeah.

08:10.800 --> 08:11.800
Back and forth.

08:11.800 --> 08:15.720
And I've always been drawn to, I think for me really what it was is Linux and where my

08:15.720 --> 08:16.720
heart is with it.

08:16.720 --> 08:20.360
And I understand your frustrations, especially when you're trying to depend on it for a production

08:20.360 --> 08:21.360
level.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.360
Yeah.

08:22.360 --> 08:23.840
For those that didn't know, I was just griping on the livestream about audio issues we were

08:23.840 --> 08:24.840
going to get.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.800
Critical livestream issues, right?

08:27.800 --> 08:31.260
And sometimes, and that's why I say, you know, use the right tool for the job.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.000
But I'm a graphic artist.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
That's my day job.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.760
I've worked in television, I've worked in screen printing, I've worked in news, blah,

08:37.760 --> 08:39.200
blah, blah, on and on.

08:39.200 --> 08:43.600
But one of the things that I've always loved about Linux is that you can create Linux and

08:43.600 --> 08:45.880
you can make Linux what you want.

08:45.880 --> 08:48.940
And that's evident by all the slew of distros we have.

08:48.940 --> 08:53.280
That's evident by MioLinux that just came out recently, right?

08:53.280 --> 08:59.520
Even anyone that's in the Mumble Room, that's in the IRC, that's a student at Linux Academy,

08:59.520 --> 09:02.400
anyone can make their own distro.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.720
And I think for me, that's what really drew me into it.

09:05.720 --> 09:12.360
And then naturally, you know, I guess to date myself a little bit, we didn't have necessarily

09:12.360 --> 09:16.200
YouTubes in those days of learning the Linux.

09:16.200 --> 09:21.960
So I had to buy my first copy from a comp USA bargain bin at that, you know.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.720
Actually, but I enjoyed getting the box copy back then.

09:24.720 --> 09:25.720
I did too, man.

09:25.720 --> 09:26.720
I liked that.

09:26.720 --> 09:32.600
I did have to go out of my way to get a four megabyte Trident video card to support my

09:32.600 --> 09:37.880
first install of, I think it was Slack that I was having a problem with.

09:37.880 --> 09:42.560
Soos worked fine, you know, but it was Slackware at the time that my roommate had got me into

09:42.560 --> 09:45.440
that I couldn't run without having another video card.

09:45.440 --> 09:46.440
That's about right.

09:46.440 --> 09:51.400
And so I think like, I think back to some of the problems that I had like way back then,

09:51.400 --> 09:54.000
you know, it was like, it was broken.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.440
There was nothing there.

09:55.440 --> 10:02.080
There were no communication channels or YouTube videos or Linux academies to teach you, right?

10:02.080 --> 10:06.240
It was, you just slog through it, oh, you found IRC, right?

10:06.240 --> 10:10.080
And so then that's organically what brought me to Jupyter Broadcasting is the IRC channel

10:10.080 --> 10:14.600
and the support there and lack thereof sometimes.

10:14.600 --> 10:21.000
But you know, all around is a great community and I'm glad to finally be not only part of

10:21.000 --> 10:26.280
the Linux community and working professionally in the Linux community, but part of the JB

10:26.280 --> 10:28.960
family and of course, the Linux Academy family.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.440
Everyone here has just been so welcoming.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.440
Isn't that been great?

10:31.440 --> 10:32.760
Dude, it's so good.

10:32.760 --> 10:33.760
It's so good.

10:33.760 --> 10:37.040
I mean, everybody, I'm not good with faces.

10:37.040 --> 10:41.920
So I'll probably have to take a while go to the HR page and look at pictures and kind

10:41.920 --> 10:43.440
of associate names that way.

10:43.440 --> 10:48.560
But overall, like everyone has just been hands down super nice.

10:48.560 --> 10:51.280
I couldn't have asked for a better welcoming.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.040
Congratulations, Mr. Cheese Bacon.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.040
I have a question for you.

10:54.040 --> 10:55.040
Thank you.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.040
What's your actual role?

10:56.040 --> 10:58.280
What are you going to be doing with Chris?

10:58.280 --> 11:00.560
My title is a community creative engineer.

11:00.560 --> 11:05.760
So any sort of the marketing stuff that's going to be coming up?

11:05.760 --> 11:07.760
Yeah, job one is going to be swag from Linux Fest.

11:07.760 --> 11:11.060
Linux Fest, Northwest swag is in the works.

11:11.060 --> 11:16.600
If anyone just has some amazing piece of swag that they think we should look at, please,

11:16.600 --> 11:17.600
you know, reach out to me.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.040
I'd love to hear your opinions and your suggestions on that.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.040
JB engraved laptops.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.040
You heard it here first.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.040
Yeah.

11:23.040 --> 11:24.040
Branded ThinkPads for everyone.

11:24.040 --> 11:25.040
Yeah.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.040
Golden Yetis for everyone.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.040
Yeah.

11:27.040 --> 11:28.040
All right.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.040
I'm sorry, guys.

11:29.040 --> 11:34.280
Not only that, but we have new logos for all the shows in the works and updates to the

11:34.280 --> 11:37.540
website to accommodate those new logos.

11:37.540 --> 11:43.640
And so we've been working on upgrading our look because as an independent operation,

11:43.640 --> 11:47.780
I never, ever, ever had the budget to spend on that stuff.

11:47.780 --> 11:51.280
It was like a lot of times I'd come to cheese and I'd be like, hey, man, could you bang

11:51.280 --> 11:52.480
me this thing out real quick?

11:52.480 --> 11:56.680
Because I'm about to go live tomorrow morning and I need some art for the show that I just

11:56.680 --> 11:57.680
launched.

11:57.680 --> 12:02.680
Well, and tomorrow morning, maybe it may be I'm about to go live with this show in an

12:02.680 --> 12:04.920
hour and 37 minutes.

12:04.920 --> 12:05.920
Can you do something?

12:05.920 --> 12:06.920
Yeah.

12:06.920 --> 12:10.480
And of course, I mean, if wherever I can lend a hand back to the community, I was more than

12:10.480 --> 12:11.480
happy to do that.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.480
I just love it.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.240
I mean, we find somebody from the community and we can bring them in.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.240
You know, Wes too.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.240
Wes was started.

12:17.240 --> 12:21.400
You know, he came up for a community barbecue that we held at the at the studio and he smoked

12:21.400 --> 12:22.400
those meats, man.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.400
And now I'm hooked.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.400
That's right.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.400
He just took my smoked meat.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.400
Now he's in.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.280
So I just love it whenever we get an opportunity to do that.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.960
So it's really cool to have you here.

12:29.960 --> 12:30.960
Super glad.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.440
It's nice to have you in studio for this episode, too.

12:32.440 --> 12:33.960
Why don't we keep going?

12:33.960 --> 12:34.960
Keep talking a little news.

12:34.960 --> 12:40.200
We just have a few news items I'd like to go through and probably do some further digging

12:40.200 --> 12:42.200
on some of these in Linux action news this week.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.680
But let's start with this NGINX sale.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.680
Oh, yeah, that's a biggie.

12:45.680 --> 12:46.680
Yeah, man.

12:46.680 --> 12:47.680
Six hundred and seventy million.

12:47.680 --> 12:52.280
Six hundred and seventy million dollars for NGINX and they're being acquired by F5.

12:52.280 --> 12:56.760
F5 networks, which in your neck of the woods right now, aren't they, Wes?

12:56.760 --> 12:57.760
That's right.

12:57.760 --> 12:58.760
They're a Seattle based company.

12:58.760 --> 13:01.400
And if you're not familiar, I guess that's because you don't do anything with a lot of

13:01.400 --> 13:02.640
network traffic.

13:02.640 --> 13:06.480
They make load balancers, application gateways, all those things on your network that actually

13:06.480 --> 13:09.400
connects the important bits with your customers.

13:09.400 --> 13:15.420
Load balancing, eh, what would you say is a common use case for NGINX?

13:15.420 --> 13:16.420
That same thing.

13:16.420 --> 13:20.240
And you'll see a lot of stuff in this announcement about the, you know, the synergy opportunities,

13:20.240 --> 13:22.040
how they can mesh this together.

13:22.040 --> 13:25.680
But honestly, you go look at the NGINX blog from like two years ago and a lot of their

13:25.680 --> 13:29.520
entries are how to replace your expensive F5 appliance with NGINX.

13:29.520 --> 13:33.080
And now maybe that was them trying to sell their NGINX Pro, of course.

13:33.080 --> 13:38.520
But I can definitely see F5 being like, well, NGINX is by far the most popular Ingress controller

13:38.520 --> 13:41.360
on Kubernetes, especially compared to our own version of that.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.560
So how do we get our foot in the door here?

13:43.560 --> 13:44.720
I think this is a pretty smart move.

13:44.720 --> 13:45.720
I think you're right.

13:45.720 --> 13:48.440
I think this has a big part of an overall orchestration play.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.720
So that way you can snap their technology in.

13:50.720 --> 13:54.660
Now F5 is going to be able to have also a community offering that is going to remain

13:54.660 --> 13:55.660
free and open source.

13:55.660 --> 13:59.360
NGINX says that addition or their core product will remain free and open source, which is

13:59.360 --> 14:01.840
great news for me since I've run it on my personal.

14:01.840 --> 14:06.560
Yeah, I don't actually I don't get a big sense of dread and doom on this one.

14:06.560 --> 14:10.980
No, and I think a lot of times, you know, it's a lot of these doom and glooms are kind

14:10.980 --> 14:14.640
of built up by the persona anyway, right?

14:14.640 --> 14:15.640
It's kind of announcing it.

14:15.640 --> 14:18.880
Yeah, I think it's one of those things that we're just going to wait and see how it plays

14:18.880 --> 14:19.880
out.

14:19.880 --> 14:20.880
Exactly.

14:20.880 --> 14:21.880
It is definitely.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.920
Anybody in the Mumba room have a different take?

14:23.920 --> 14:26.720
Anybody concerned or startled by this acquisition?

14:26.720 --> 14:28.320
Maybe maybe I'm missing something here.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.040
I'm straight down the middle on this one.

14:30.040 --> 14:34.240
I've worked with F5 in the past as an actual vendor.

14:34.240 --> 14:39.560
I sit on the other side of the fence now with Red Hat looking in at some of the F5 integrations

14:39.560 --> 14:40.560
they have with OpenShift.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.120
That's what I was thinking about.

14:42.120 --> 14:47.840
Yeah, I think there's a lot of people use NGINX for a whole different slew of purposes.

14:47.840 --> 14:51.000
I'm going to wait and see how this one plays out.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.440
It's not like when GitHub got acquired, I was like, oh, no, what's happening here?

14:54.440 --> 14:59.180
But yeah, it's we'll see, I guess.

14:59.180 --> 15:00.180
We'll see.

15:00.180 --> 15:01.180
I agree.

15:01.180 --> 15:02.180
I don't have the GitHub sensation.

15:02.180 --> 15:04.240
So that's a that's a good way to put it.

15:04.240 --> 15:07.400
And I also I want to acknowledge you're right.

15:07.400 --> 15:11.480
We've sort of we sort of pigeonholed NGINX as one particular type of functionality.

15:11.480 --> 15:12.480
It does.

15:12.480 --> 15:13.480
It's a web server.

15:13.480 --> 15:14.480
It does a lot of things.

15:14.480 --> 15:18.600
It's just a very common use case has been accelerating applications behind it or proxying

15:18.600 --> 15:19.600
connections.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.160
We use NGINX in production.

15:21.160 --> 15:22.160
Yeah, of course we do.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.120
It is kind of a nice moment to reflect.

15:24.120 --> 15:27.000
I mean, I don't remember the last time I spun up an Apache server.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.920
I just really don't because NGINX by some measures is like 67 percent of web connections.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.640
It's just crazy how successful of a project it's been.

15:34.640 --> 15:36.280
Probably a lot of reason because it's open source.

15:36.280 --> 15:41.600
Have any of you seen whether there is any change in NGINX's commitment to being open

15:41.600 --> 15:43.120
or not as a consequence of this?

15:43.120 --> 15:44.880
Because that would change my opinion.

15:44.880 --> 15:48.960
As they say, F5 is committed to continued innovation and increasing investment in the

15:48.960 --> 15:52.680
NGINX open source project to empower NGINX's widespread user community.

15:52.680 --> 15:55.520
They're also keeping the CEO and founders on board.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.040
OK, until you all forget in three years anyway.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.040
Right.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.440
I mean, things got a vest and yeah.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.200
But it is a good sign that they're staying on board for now.

16:02.200 --> 16:07.080
I think, though, for me, the 670 million is I mean, that's a little low, right?

16:07.080 --> 16:08.080
Yeah.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.080
I mean, that's good money.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.080
Don't get me wrong.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.080
It is.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.080
It is good money.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.960
And it's, you know, or is this the first real software company valuation that we've seen

16:14.960 --> 16:15.960
for a while?

16:15.960 --> 16:17.320
Oh, there you go to us.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.320
That's a great point.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.320
Yeah.

16:19.320 --> 16:22.720
This is a first non overinflated right evaluation.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.720
Right.

16:23.720 --> 16:27.600
Yeah, there is there is that sort of hype bubble that we have right now where things

16:27.600 --> 16:30.240
are just going for, I mean, crazy prices.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.240
Absolutely.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.320
And then on the other end of the spectrum, you have projects like sway, which probably

16:34.320 --> 16:36.580
will never sell for millions of dollars.

16:36.580 --> 16:40.280
But heck, if they aren't just chugging away and getting more and more impressive all the

16:40.280 --> 16:46.780
time and they have finally reached version one dot o, which is the first stable release

16:46.780 --> 16:47.780
of sway.

16:47.780 --> 16:50.720
Now, I guess we should probably back up a little bit.

16:50.720 --> 16:55.680
Sway is how what is a what is a concise way to explain what sway is.

16:55.680 --> 17:02.140
So in the world of Wayland, you need certain new components that the in the past were provided

17:02.140 --> 17:03.820
by the display server.

17:03.820 --> 17:07.020
And now with Wayland being a protocol, you need to write your own display server and

17:07.020 --> 17:09.520
you need to be able to provide certain sets of functionality.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.680
And we spent a while kind of worrying about that.

17:11.680 --> 17:12.680
Right.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.800
We're like, well, OK, the big projects, they're going to make that happen.

17:14.800 --> 17:15.800
Sure.

17:15.800 --> 17:16.800
No KD.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.840
But what about all the other wonderful bespoke environments that we all love?

17:19.840 --> 17:20.840
Yeah.

17:20.840 --> 17:24.800
So sway is really turned into an umbrella project of a bunch of other things.

17:24.800 --> 17:29.420
You have a tiling window manager that runs on top of Wayland, but you also have sway

17:29.420 --> 17:38.800
idle, sway lock, grim slurp, WF recorder, a bunch of sub utilities that manage and take

17:38.800 --> 17:43.900
care of stuff in a Wayland setup that in the past you didn't have to worry about as much.

17:43.900 --> 17:45.120
And think I three as well.

17:45.120 --> 17:49.480
I mean, if you're if you're going to talk about the desktop, it's very much an I three

17:49.480 --> 17:50.780
compatibility.

17:50.780 --> 17:55.120
And you noticed in there that they have a particular tool and keeping in mind that this

17:55.120 --> 17:57.920
is a tiling window manager, which is usually going to be covered by windows.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.720
Why don't you tell us about that?

17:59.720 --> 18:00.720
All right.

18:00.720 --> 18:04.880
So so the last tool that they list here on their post is is a wall utils, which is a

18:04.880 --> 18:10.800
beautiful wallpaper utility that you can set time.

18:10.800 --> 18:18.280
So say if you wanted to crossfade two images between 10 a.m. and noon, you know, to basically

18:18.280 --> 18:20.960
transform your desktop throughout the day.

18:20.960 --> 18:21.960
You can do that.

18:21.960 --> 18:27.360
And I mean, there's just some really amazing other features there set set up.

18:27.360 --> 18:30.840
You can get your DPI really for all your monitors.

18:30.840 --> 18:34.360
You just put like for the for the background one, you just put the time of day range in

18:34.360 --> 18:35.360
the file name.

18:35.360 --> 18:36.360
Essentially.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.360
Yes.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.360
Right.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.360
Essentially.

18:39.360 --> 18:40.360
Basically.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.360
Basically.

18:41.360 --> 18:42.360
And then it from that interprets the range that you wanted to calculate.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.360
Absolutely.

18:43.360 --> 18:44.360
How does that work?

18:44.360 --> 18:45.360
So on a tiling window manager when you've got tiles?

18:45.360 --> 18:46.360
Yeah.

18:46.360 --> 18:47.360
Tiles of windows.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.360
Yeah.

18:48.360 --> 18:52.280
You know, they in the demo for it, they do show that you can you can gap the windows,

18:52.280 --> 18:53.280
right?

18:53.280 --> 18:58.300
So you can have 20, 40, 80, however many pixels, however far you want to reduce your window.

18:58.300 --> 19:03.560
But then you're still going to get the gap view of the desktop.

19:03.560 --> 19:07.240
I mean, I think that this is still a great utility that that's going to be used.

19:07.240 --> 19:10.200
I think we're going to see this widely adopted in other places as well.

19:10.200 --> 19:13.640
Yeah, that's the great thing is other projects can take advantage of this code.

19:13.640 --> 19:14.640
Yeah, absolutely.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.760
I mean, way bar is also really clean, really nice.

19:17.760 --> 19:18.760
That's an alternative panel.

19:18.760 --> 19:19.760
They've developed.

19:19.760 --> 19:20.760
Yeah, that's their alternative panel.

19:20.760 --> 19:27.400
They get their own video capture slurp, I thought was kind of a weird name for interactive

19:27.400 --> 19:28.400
region.

19:28.400 --> 19:29.400
Yeah.

19:29.400 --> 19:33.320
So like hovering your mouse to the corner and viewing your windows and stuff.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.800
That's another one with a tiling window manager.

19:35.800 --> 19:36.800
Oh, yeah.

19:36.800 --> 19:37.800
Good point.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.080
Most of those going to be present and visible.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.080
That's kind of a neat thing here, right?

19:41.080 --> 19:44.480
Is there are so many that just been this community that sprung up solving all kinds of little

19:44.480 --> 19:49.920
problems in the Wayland ecosystem, regardless of how directly useful they might be on sway.

19:49.920 --> 19:50.920
Exactly.

19:50.920 --> 19:54.600
I think that's what's really cool about it, because they say here in their release, nearly

19:54.600 --> 20:01.440
300 people work together for doing this over 9000 commits and almost 100,000 lines of code

20:01.440 --> 20:08.800
from version point one five to the one point I release, you know, I'm actually tempted

20:08.800 --> 20:10.200
to try myself, man.

20:10.200 --> 20:15.240
I was going to ask the community out there if anybody knows of like a distro that just

20:15.240 --> 20:17.400
sort of set up with this ready to go.

20:17.400 --> 20:20.560
So I could get like, I'd love to see it like in the floating window mode and all that kind

20:20.560 --> 20:21.560
of stuff.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.560
Absolutely.

20:22.560 --> 20:25.280
Just so I could like pop it on a live like USB thumb drive and try it out for an afternoon.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.680
So if you know of one, let me know.

20:26.680 --> 20:29.560
And supposedly there's improved touch screen support as well.

20:29.560 --> 20:35.280
So devices, mobile devices in the future can also utilize this, which, you know, tiling

20:35.280 --> 20:40.720
window manager in a mobile devices might be actually kind of a good use of mobile space

20:40.720 --> 20:41.720
screen.

20:41.720 --> 20:42.720
Especially like on a tablet.

20:42.720 --> 20:43.720
Absolutely.

20:43.720 --> 20:44.720
See that.

20:44.720 --> 20:45.720
Absolutely.

20:45.720 --> 20:46.720
Kind of want to give it a go.

20:46.720 --> 20:47.720
Be like a sway challenge.

20:47.720 --> 20:48.720
Sway challenge.

20:48.720 --> 20:49.720
Any distro you want.

20:49.720 --> 20:50.720
But try it out.

20:50.720 --> 20:51.720
Yeah.

20:51.720 --> 20:52.720
I can see that.

20:52.720 --> 20:53.720
All right.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.860
Why don't we this is the next one's kind of uncomfortable.

20:55.860 --> 20:59.000
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
It's at least negative.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.760
I don't know if it's in the freedom dimension or not, but it's negative.

21:02.760 --> 21:05.400
I don't know how to really tackle this one because we don't have direct involvement.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.300
But I think it's important because Debian is important.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.720
And so we're going to we're going to have to talk about this.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.800
This is a post by Michael Stapleberg, I think is how you say his name.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.280
But I've actually never had to say it out loud.

21:15.280 --> 21:17.520
So I apologize, Michael, if I got that wrong.

21:17.520 --> 21:22.680
He's worked with Debian for 10 years and he wrote a blog post a little while ago about

21:22.680 --> 21:27.160
issues debugging software on Debian and some of the workflow frustrations he had.

21:27.160 --> 21:31.480
And this week he's written a blog post about leaving Debian after 10 years.

21:31.480 --> 21:37.140
It's a long time, says a few weeks ago, I visited some old friends at a Debian meetup

21:37.140 --> 21:41.460
after a multi year period of absence on my bike ride home.

21:41.460 --> 21:47.360
It occurred to me that the topics of our discussion had remarkable overlap with my last visit.

21:47.360 --> 21:50.600
Have you ever done this like you go talk to some old buddies and just have like the same

21:50.600 --> 21:54.600
little conversation you had like five years ago and it doesn't quite click like it used

21:54.600 --> 21:55.600
to?

21:55.600 --> 21:56.600
Yeah.

21:56.600 --> 21:57.600
Yeah.

21:57.600 --> 22:00.520
So he's he's like a man, you know, I went to this meetup and we had a discussion about

22:00.520 --> 22:05.560
the merits of system D, which took a detour to the respect in the open source communities.

22:05.560 --> 22:06.560
Happens all the time.

22:06.560 --> 22:08.860
Especially when you bring up system D. Yep.

22:08.860 --> 22:15.480
And then he says it returned to processes in Debian and eventually culminated in a discussion

22:15.480 --> 22:21.160
around democracies and their theoretical and practical failings.

22:21.160 --> 22:24.960
Why do we always seem to dig ourselves into this hole?

22:24.960 --> 22:29.720
We like we always somehow the community manages to hate on itself.

22:29.720 --> 22:30.720
I know.

22:30.720 --> 22:31.720
We do.

22:31.720 --> 22:32.720
We do.

22:32.720 --> 22:37.280
And he says, I walked away from this thinking to myself, I think I'm done having this conversation.

22:37.280 --> 22:42.320
I think I'm done discussing the same things over and over again and nothing ever changes.

22:42.320 --> 22:43.600
And it wore him out.

22:43.600 --> 22:51.080
And he went on to point out some other issues that it sound are just brutal.

22:51.080 --> 22:53.480
Reviews are horribly slow.

22:53.480 --> 22:55.960
Publishing packages can take up to seven hours.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.520
Anonymous FTPs.

22:57.520 --> 23:03.560
Yeah, anonymous FTP uploads, filing bugs that with a bug system that doesn't even have a

23:03.560 --> 23:06.600
proper web interface where you communicate over email with it.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.620
And it's it's weird and ancient.

23:09.620 --> 23:14.000
It sounds like to that there's an issue where a lot of people can just sort of slow down

23:14.000 --> 23:16.320
the whole thing and make change very hard.

23:16.320 --> 23:19.120
Even if it's not something like system B, even if it's something simple, like we should

23:19.120 --> 23:21.640
change this package so that it meets our requirements.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.160
It makes a good point, right?

23:23.160 --> 23:27.200
Like our culture needs to shift from this package is my domain, how dare you touch it

23:27.200 --> 23:30.200
to a shared sense of ownership, which is as a community member.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.440
That's how I kind of thought things would already be thought of.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.440
Mm hmm.

23:33.440 --> 23:36.040
I don't see how it's possible to create a unified desktop without that.

23:36.040 --> 23:40.880
Yeah, he says my canonical example is our sink, whose maintainer refused my patches

23:40.880 --> 23:45.680
to make the package use Deb Helper purely out of personal preference.

23:45.680 --> 23:48.880
Personal preference to not match the way we do things for our sink.

23:48.880 --> 23:49.880
Right?

23:49.880 --> 23:52.280
We're not even talking like system D or controversial things here.

23:52.280 --> 23:55.120
We're talking our tiny little command line utility.

23:55.120 --> 23:56.120
Right?

23:56.120 --> 24:00.800
Yeah, he says granting so much personal freedom to individual maintainers prevents as a as

24:00.800 --> 24:05.360
a project from raising the abstraction level for building Debian packages, which in turn

24:05.360 --> 24:06.880
makes tooling harder.

24:06.880 --> 24:10.680
Then you have wildly divergent workflows.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.280
And he goes on a little bit about that.

24:12.280 --> 24:15.440
He talks about the time it takes to build packages.

24:15.440 --> 24:20.520
All of this really kind of comes into like a Yeah, I can understand that be really frustrating

24:20.520 --> 24:25.180
that would burn a lot of people out and is probably going to prevent a lot of new blood

24:25.180 --> 24:26.640
coming into the project.

24:26.640 --> 24:29.020
That's the part that I think is important is because we're hearing from someone who's

24:29.020 --> 24:30.960
been experienced and a member of the project.

24:30.960 --> 24:34.080
And there are some debates like newer is not always better.

24:34.080 --> 24:36.880
And there are sometimes reasons why, yes, it's good to get contributions.

24:36.880 --> 24:41.200
But if you get too many contributions that are, you know, aren't well formed enough that

24:41.200 --> 24:45.720
they take so much time, that can sometimes be worse rather than better.

24:45.720 --> 24:49.480
But it just seems like when you're hearing this stuff from someone who's trying really

24:49.480 --> 24:54.120
hard putting in a ton of time to make this work, a little modernization that could that

24:54.120 --> 24:55.400
could grease some wheels here.

24:55.400 --> 24:56.400
Yeah.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.240
So John had a follow up.

24:58.240 --> 25:02.360
He so another gentleman, John Grosman, I think is how you are probably getting that wrong

25:02.360 --> 25:03.360
too.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.360
That's what I do.

25:04.360 --> 25:07.000
Did a follow up defensive Debian blog post.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.240
I know you had a chance to read it, Wes.

25:08.240 --> 25:12.940
I'm curious what your takeaway from his defensive Debian was he like, for example, he spins

25:12.940 --> 25:17.280
like the bug tracker not having a Web interface as a good thing because it means less people

25:17.280 --> 25:18.280
submit bugs.

25:18.280 --> 25:20.160
So as a maintainer, you have less work.

25:20.160 --> 25:22.120
I don't know if that's quite how I would compare it.

25:22.120 --> 25:25.840
I think I think it's really low bugs that don't have any reproducibility information

25:25.840 --> 25:28.400
bugs that like are more work than they're worth fixing.

25:28.400 --> 25:31.920
If you can give me a really good bug case, I want to investigate it.

25:31.920 --> 25:35.100
But if it's just like, hey, this didn't work, I don't really know why.

25:35.100 --> 25:38.120
So really, the case was made for tools that help that.

25:38.120 --> 25:41.480
And when you're reporting something online, you don't have scripts that could go gather

25:41.480 --> 25:43.880
all that information on the command line.

25:43.880 --> 25:47.040
And really, I read this as not Debian is doing everything right.

25:47.040 --> 25:53.020
But sometimes workflows are different from either the person on the on the side accepting

25:53.020 --> 25:56.600
contributions than on the side making contributions.

25:56.600 --> 26:00.560
And that GitHub might, you know, we shouldn't think of GitHub as like the ultimate workflow

26:00.560 --> 26:03.040
for everyone, because it's just not it's a new thing.

26:03.040 --> 26:04.280
It's a proprietary service.

26:04.280 --> 26:05.280
Totally.

26:05.280 --> 26:09.020
It does make sense to try to optimize and make things smooth, but not at the expense

26:09.020 --> 26:11.320
of ruining all other workflows.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.080
I think the bug tracker one, though, is an interesting one.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.960
So it's software that was designed in 94.

26:15.960 --> 26:20.240
It had its one of its more major updates in 99.

26:20.240 --> 26:24.720
And the Gnome project and the KDE project abandoned it in 2002.

26:24.720 --> 26:26.280
And they were one of the last holdouts.

26:26.280 --> 26:32.560
Debian is the only project using this software that I know of besides I believe there is

26:32.560 --> 26:36.760
a GNU version that's that's used to build a viewer for it.

26:36.760 --> 26:42.280
So there is like a there is a second project, but again, no one widely uses it at all.

26:42.280 --> 26:47.120
And this whole barrier to entry is, I think, maybe maybe I'm wrong, Wes.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.840
But to me, it seems like it's going to turn off new adoption.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.080
Yeah, new adoption.

26:51.080 --> 26:53.280
And again, like you don't want to make it.

26:53.280 --> 26:57.600
It's not always only about making contributions easy, but you want the whole process to be

26:57.600 --> 27:00.840
easy so that it's easy to make a reasonable contribution and that you have the people

27:00.840 --> 27:04.320
on the back end trying to play in between all these systems can actually make it work

27:04.320 --> 27:05.800
without pulling their hair out.

27:05.800 --> 27:09.640
OK, so here's my here's my other take on this, too.

27:09.640 --> 27:14.920
Is you have this whole people in the project are slow to change.

27:14.920 --> 27:18.200
They have their they have their domains that they own and they don't want to do it their

27:18.200 --> 27:20.400
way because of their personal preference.

27:20.400 --> 27:24.360
And as a project, there's really nothing they can do about this.

27:24.360 --> 27:26.720
Is that actually a good thing?

27:26.720 --> 27:27.760
Is it a good thing?

27:27.760 --> 27:29.960
Because it's not the only Linux in town.

27:29.960 --> 27:30.960
We've got Fedora.

27:30.960 --> 27:31.960
We've got Ubuntu.

27:31.960 --> 27:32.960
We've got Gentoo.

27:32.960 --> 27:33.960
We've got Arch.

27:33.960 --> 27:37.480
We've got all these other distributions that are going at wildly different paces that have

27:37.480 --> 27:40.360
totally different organizational structures.

27:40.360 --> 27:43.800
And we're kind of field testing everything at once in this way.

27:43.800 --> 27:51.160
And so in in a like a high level version of looking at the Linux ecosystem, if you will,

27:51.160 --> 27:56.320
and the crazy experiment that is distributions of that Linux ecosystem, isn't it good to

27:56.320 --> 28:04.760
have one of them in the market be extremely conscientious about change and be really intentional

28:04.760 --> 28:09.340
about what changes make it in and make it harder even to make change because the end

28:09.340 --> 28:14.000
result is a distribution that has a type of stability that goes beyond software stability

28:14.000 --> 28:18.720
but is also a type of change stability, which makes it better for deployments and enterprise.

28:18.720 --> 28:22.080
It makes it easier to build your applications or services off of it.

28:22.080 --> 28:25.240
I mean, that can be seen as a positive thing.

28:25.240 --> 28:28.240
And because it's not the only Linux in town, it's not the end of the world.

28:28.240 --> 28:29.240
Yeah.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.820
And that has historically been one of Debian's strengths, right?

28:30.820 --> 28:33.840
You can trust that if you've got an LTS released, you're running on your server, you can you

28:33.840 --> 28:37.740
can probably apply all those unintended upgrades, and it's it's not gonna break.

28:37.740 --> 28:42.340
The question I think is not to avoid all modernization, but to find the best points to put in the

28:42.340 --> 28:46.300
effort so that you keep your old guard while making it easier for new people.

28:46.300 --> 28:50.320
And I think that's, that's the message we should take away here is Debian deserves more

28:50.320 --> 28:53.760
involvement and and everyone should be concerned about its future, not because it's the only

28:53.760 --> 28:56.600
game in town, but because it has a lot to offer everyone.

28:56.600 --> 28:57.800
I think it's it's Debian, man.

28:57.800 --> 29:00.200
I mean, that was one of my first distros, right?

29:00.200 --> 29:03.760
Slackware, Seuss, Debian, right?

29:03.760 --> 29:06.200
Look at the impact Ubuntu has, which is based on Debian.

29:06.200 --> 29:07.680
Absolutely, right?

29:07.680 --> 29:12.080
I think and I think you know, you really touched on something when you talk about should should

29:12.080 --> 29:15.860
a distro be slow to adopt new technology?

29:15.860 --> 29:20.240
And I think so, to some degree is, you know, they should, but I also see where Michael's

29:20.240 --> 29:27.720
coming from in that, guys, like, at this point, now we need to, you know, everybody buys their

29:27.720 --> 29:30.280
groceries online, right?

29:30.280 --> 29:34.220
We can still go to the store and get groceries and fill up baskets and do it that way and

29:34.220 --> 29:35.900
bag our stuff and bring it home.

29:35.900 --> 29:42.760
Or we can, you know, we don't have to jump the whole distro on board and change everything

29:42.760 --> 29:43.760
overnight.

29:43.760 --> 29:49.120
But I think small improvements that will help the workflow and that will inevitably help

29:49.120 --> 29:54.800
the distribution grow and help the distribution get patches.

29:54.800 --> 30:00.160
You know, I know that whenever just recently whenever Debian had its issue with apt, right,

30:00.160 --> 30:05.280
they were on top of it, and they got it patched quick, like the same day, practically.

30:05.280 --> 30:09.580
So I mean, they are there and they are willing, I think, to tackle tackle those problems.

30:09.580 --> 30:15.000
But I think that, you know, when you see all the evolution of technologies and how other

30:15.000 --> 30:21.120
distros handle things in today's day, that to bring some of that in isn't necessarily

30:21.120 --> 30:22.120
bad.

30:22.120 --> 30:27.940
But also, you should, you know, have that distro that's a little more staid.

30:27.940 --> 30:31.560
You made me think of our recent discussion about Fedora's internal discussion about,

30:31.560 --> 30:35.440
you know, maybe delaying the release to work on their developer Tungain.

30:35.440 --> 30:39.680
So clearly they are an example of people that are trying to actively tackle this problem.

30:39.680 --> 30:43.240
Okay, I've got a few more thoughts on this, but I want to give the virtual log a chance

30:43.240 --> 30:44.560
to chime in.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.760
Mr. Badger, what are your thoughts on this?

30:46.760 --> 30:55.720
So I use Debian as my primary home server, and I have done for maybe seven or eight years,

30:55.720 --> 30:56.720
at least.

30:56.720 --> 31:04.000
And over that time, I found that the actual distro itself, in my server context at least,

31:04.000 --> 31:10.720
has become less and less relevant as containers have taken over and other technologies that

31:10.720 --> 31:14.600
cheese bacon alluded to just now.

31:14.600 --> 31:21.360
And I think, for me, it boils down to how you structure the governance of an open source

31:21.360 --> 31:22.360
project.

31:22.360 --> 31:25.600
And this is something that we're trying to go through at Linux Server IO right now is

31:25.600 --> 31:31.720
trying to figure out how to structure decision-making processes and not just have it be beholden

31:31.720 --> 31:37.880
to one or two people's kind of beck and call, which it's a natural process growing out of

31:37.880 --> 31:41.440
a personal project into a community project.

31:41.440 --> 31:45.640
I think Debian's possibly too far the other way for my personal taste.

31:45.640 --> 31:51.280
I think it's a fantastic project and a great asset to the Linux community.

31:51.280 --> 31:52.280
Don't get me wrong.

31:52.280 --> 31:58.480
I do think that there are definitely opportunities for improvement in the way in which the governance

31:58.480 --> 31:59.480
model works.

31:59.480 --> 32:05.120
I don't know if the pace of packages and stuff like that could be potentially changed, but

32:05.120 --> 32:09.720
then does it need to when you have things like Ubuntu upstream that are a lot more quote

32:09.720 --> 32:15.760
unquote modern and fresh, and you have so many other distros filling that niche?

32:15.760 --> 32:20.640
I would argue that no, you don't need Debian to be completely up to date.

32:20.640 --> 32:26.960
But I do have another point around the relationship between Debian and its children like Ubuntu.

32:26.960 --> 32:32.260
I know I work for Red Hat, so that's full disclosure, but you look at the relationship

32:32.260 --> 32:38.000
between Fedora and Red Hat and CentOS, and I think there's definitely some room for improvement

32:38.000 --> 32:43.800
in just the velocity of the project and trying to make decisions and trying to keep people

32:43.800 --> 32:47.000
engaged with that workflow.

32:47.000 --> 32:52.560
I don't know quite what my point is, but I look at the ways in which Red Hat give back

32:52.560 --> 32:59.280
to the community via all the open source contributions to the kernel and to desktop environments and

32:59.280 --> 33:02.000
yada yada yada.

33:02.000 --> 33:07.120
I think that there's definitely room for improvement with Debian in that space.

33:07.120 --> 33:13.280
It's clear that there has been internal conflict that has torn the project up.

33:13.280 --> 33:17.640
It's not just one developer who's rage quitting, which he's not, he's actually very gracious

33:17.640 --> 33:19.760
in his goodbye letter.

33:19.760 --> 33:24.340
It's a bigger problem, and his leaving is symptomatic of that bigger problem.

33:24.340 --> 33:27.000
The System D debate tore them up.

33:27.000 --> 33:32.920
But now in almost an embarrassing statement of the state of the project, they literally

33:32.920 --> 33:36.200
could be entering a situation where they are leaderless.

33:36.200 --> 33:41.460
Yeah, normally this time in the year, well, it's election season for Debian.

33:41.460 --> 33:45.720
Over a six-week period, traditionally, interested candidates would put their names forward,

33:45.720 --> 33:49.760
describe their vision for the project as a whole, answer questions from interested developers

33:49.760 --> 33:51.920
trying to vet them, and then wait.

33:51.920 --> 33:56.000
Watch they'd have a voting period, wait for the votes to come in, and huzzah, a new leader

33:56.000 --> 33:57.480
would be elected.

33:57.480 --> 34:01.640
Unfortunately, this time around, no one has stepped forward.

34:01.640 --> 34:02.640
Yikes.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.380
They've missed the first one, right?

34:04.380 --> 34:06.080
So they're on the second round.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.080
Yeah, they just go again.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.560
They just keep going.

34:08.560 --> 34:12.360
Yeah, to their credit, the Constitution does have rules.

34:12.360 --> 34:14.240
It's just an infinite loop.

34:14.240 --> 34:18.440
Yeah, and there's no rule that says the current leader, Chris Lamb, must remain.

34:18.440 --> 34:19.440
Absolutely.

34:19.440 --> 34:22.180
Once his time is over, he's free to walk.

34:22.180 --> 34:28.160
And he said he doesn't intend to run for reelection for various personal and project-related

34:28.160 --> 34:32.360
reasons that he's asked people not to speculate about, so we'll respect that.

34:32.360 --> 34:35.800
And that leaves them in sort of an awkward position.

34:35.800 --> 34:39.840
The Debian project, though, scatters authority throughout the project, so it's not like they're

34:39.840 --> 34:43.960
going to be unfunctional, like they're going to continue on.

34:43.960 --> 34:49.760
A lot of it is in the hands of the individual maintainers or positions in the Debian project.

34:49.760 --> 34:52.220
I'll give you a couple examples.

34:52.220 --> 34:56.440
Individual developers have nearly absolute control over the packages they maintain.

34:56.440 --> 35:00.920
Difficult technical disagreements will get sorted out between developers and the technical

35:00.920 --> 35:01.920
committee.

35:01.920 --> 35:06.920
The release managers and the FTP masters make the final decision on when things actually

35:06.920 --> 35:12.760
ship, and the project secretary ensures the necessary procedures are followed in general.

35:12.760 --> 35:16.520
And then there's a policy team that handles much of the overall design for the distribution.

35:16.520 --> 35:20.800
So in a sense, there's not a lot left for the leader to do other than to fully represent

35:20.800 --> 35:21.800
the project and go out there.

35:21.800 --> 35:25.480
Just show up to the conference and be the face, right?

35:25.480 --> 35:27.160
Play the politics role, I suppose.

35:27.160 --> 35:28.160
Yeah.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.920
I think it also goes back to the last story, right?

35:30.920 --> 35:35.600
I mean, it kind of falls back on what Alex was saying about governance and how these

35:35.600 --> 35:37.440
things all play in together.

35:37.440 --> 35:38.440
Yeah.

35:38.440 --> 35:45.560
And are we just seeing a really outdated governance that needs to basically go back and kind of

35:45.560 --> 35:47.600
rewrite to freshen itself up?

35:47.600 --> 35:50.760
Or just even take a look at how they do things and see where they can improve or where they

35:50.760 --> 35:51.920
can modernize.

35:51.920 --> 35:55.600
We should compare it though, right, to other projects that have gotten this wrong, Solus

35:55.600 --> 35:56.600
comes to mind.

35:56.600 --> 35:58.820
Not that they haven't fixed it, but governance is a good thing.

35:58.820 --> 36:02.560
So while clearly there are some problems, is it better to have this problem than the

36:02.560 --> 36:06.040
problem of one person gets hit with a bus and there goes your distro?

36:06.040 --> 36:07.040
Yeah.

36:07.040 --> 36:13.160
Well, the Debian bunch is super easy to convince and get everybody on the same page.

36:13.160 --> 36:15.120
So I'm sure there'll be no problem.

36:15.120 --> 36:21.080
What was the one quote about machine learning in the Debian story?

36:21.080 --> 36:22.080
Oh, you're right.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.080
I don't know if you...

36:23.080 --> 36:24.080
Did you see this one, Wes?

36:24.080 --> 36:28.720
They put one of the Debian maintainers suggested that the leadership position could be fulfilled

36:28.720 --> 36:31.280
by a machine using some sort of machine learning program.

36:31.280 --> 36:32.280
Oh, that's great.

36:32.280 --> 36:34.160
As long as it's open source, I'm all for it.

36:34.160 --> 36:35.160
That's so funny.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.900
That would be actually kind of awesome, wouldn't it?

36:37.900 --> 36:43.680
If they open source like a distribution management engine that uses machine learning and just

36:43.680 --> 36:45.360
watches the mailing list and...

36:45.360 --> 36:49.800
But it's like taking everything from like pin and paper is where we are, guys, to robots.

36:49.800 --> 36:50.800
Yeah, here it is.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.020
Some developers seem to relish this possibility.

36:53.020 --> 36:57.160
Even one suggesting machine learning system could be placed into the role instead of a

36:57.160 --> 36:58.960
human for the leadership position.

36:58.960 --> 37:01.800
What does that say about the previous leader, if anything?

37:01.800 --> 37:04.040
That does feel like commentary on...

37:04.040 --> 37:06.000
Well, and also just the structure, right?

37:06.000 --> 37:07.000
Because there's not...

37:07.000 --> 37:08.000
The leader doesn't do that much.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
It's mostly a figurehead.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
There you go.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.880
Although I don't know how it would work at the conferences.

37:12.880 --> 37:16.560
You know, we sit here and we say, oh, modernize governance, improve this, do that.

37:16.560 --> 37:20.360
But the reality is that is way easier said than done.

37:20.360 --> 37:25.320
And time they spend on fixing that stuff is time they don't spend on shipping Debian.

37:25.320 --> 37:27.040
And that's going to be a constant struggle.

37:27.040 --> 37:31.280
But it's important, though, without the governance, you won't have a Debian going forward.

37:31.280 --> 37:32.280
I completely agree.

37:32.280 --> 37:36.360
But if you're using technology from the 90s...

37:36.360 --> 37:37.360
That's the trick, right?

37:37.360 --> 37:38.360
It's a balance.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.040
And so there's no like, we're not going to solve this right now.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.280
It's going to be a lot more work.

37:42.280 --> 37:43.880
Yeah, I suppose so.

37:43.880 --> 37:44.880
All right.

37:44.880 --> 37:45.880
Well, how about I pick us up with something?

37:45.880 --> 37:50.860
I found a couple of clips to celebrate the the World Wide Web and the Internet.

37:50.860 --> 37:54.880
And I went and you know me, I love pulling clips and cheese bacon here said, you got

37:54.880 --> 37:56.560
to go get some for the Computer Chronicles.

37:56.560 --> 37:59.880
So this is just a real quick little let's just pick us back up.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.280
Let's just change the mood a little bit with this one.

38:02.280 --> 38:07.040
Marshall McLuhan said that one day we would all live in a global village, an electronic

38:07.040 --> 38:11.960
community interconnected by communications networks that would shrink the earth.

38:11.960 --> 38:17.200
Well, the global village has arrived and its main street is called the Internet, where

38:17.200 --> 38:21.720
people from around the world do meet electronically to exchange ideas.

38:21.720 --> 38:26.960
Today we'll surf the net, we'll explore the Internet on this edition of the Computer

38:26.960 --> 38:27.960
Chronicles.

38:27.960 --> 38:38.180
The Internet, yes, and then we built these communities and then we created operating

38:38.180 --> 38:42.080
systems and well, I think we all remember what happened after that.

38:42.080 --> 38:43.080
I think we all know.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.080
There you have it.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.080
There you have it.

38:45.080 --> 38:48.520
I hope the Debian project, I hope things sort out.

38:48.520 --> 38:51.400
I think they've been doing a lot of things the same way for a very long time.

38:51.400 --> 38:52.400
So it's a difficult thing.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.000
But you know what?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.000
Enterprising people over there.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.160
How about a little housekeeping, gentlemen?

38:58.160 --> 38:59.960
How about a little housekeeping?

38:59.960 --> 39:03.600
Now, there's a couple of things to cover.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.480
First of all, I was going to introduce you, but I already did.

39:05.480 --> 39:06.480
So hi cheese.

39:06.480 --> 39:07.480
Hey, welcome aboard.

39:07.480 --> 39:08.480
Thank you.

39:08.480 --> 39:12.100
We published the Linux OS Fundamental Study Group that we did last week that is now up

39:12.100 --> 39:13.100
on YouTube.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.100
We have a link in the show notes.

39:14.100 --> 39:17.720
So if you were not able to attend live, you can go watch the recorded version.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.800
Thank you to Kenny and Elle for putting that on.

39:19.800 --> 39:22.920
You will find that in the show notes or on our YouTube channel.

39:22.920 --> 39:28.120
And speaking of YouTube videos, oh, boy.

39:28.120 --> 39:32.340
So they have today's the birthday for Linux Academy, so seventh anniversary.

39:32.340 --> 39:38.480
And to celebrate, they did a trivia game where they took a few contestants, including myself,

39:38.480 --> 39:41.680
and asked them trivia related to Linux Academy.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.720
And then if you got the trivia wrong, you had to eat a bowl of chili.

39:44.720 --> 39:45.720
And there was five bowls.

39:45.720 --> 39:49.400
And they progressively got hotter and hotter until they were eventually on fire.

39:49.400 --> 39:52.240
And being the new guy, I didn't do so well.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.760
I didn't know all this stuff.

39:54.760 --> 39:55.760
You know?

39:55.760 --> 39:56.760
I'm new.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.120
So I really bombed.

39:58.120 --> 39:59.880
And I had to eat a lot of hot chili.

39:59.880 --> 40:02.040
And they've posted that video today.

40:02.040 --> 40:04.400
And it's a lot of me being tortured.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.600
There's a lot of me getting tortured in that video.

40:06.600 --> 40:07.600
It's bad.

40:07.600 --> 40:09.480
You learned a lot about the Scoville unit that day.

40:09.480 --> 40:10.480
I did.

40:10.480 --> 40:11.480
I did.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.160
So that'll be in the show notes as well.

40:13.160 --> 40:16.240
It's up on the Linux Academy comm YouTube channel, Linux Academy comm.

40:16.240 --> 40:17.240
And it's great.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.120
It is a really good video.

40:19.120 --> 40:22.880
Jacob, the editor for that, managed to cut down an hour and a half into eight minutes.

40:22.880 --> 40:23.880
Did he?

40:23.880 --> 40:24.880
He did a killer job.

40:24.880 --> 40:25.880
Yeah.

40:25.880 --> 40:26.880
He really did a killer job at it.

40:26.880 --> 40:27.880
Impressive.

40:27.880 --> 40:28.880
Yeah.

40:28.880 --> 40:29.880
And man, did I burn my face off.

40:29.880 --> 40:30.880
Holy crap.

40:30.880 --> 40:35.200
And you know, and people will see, it's not like here's a whole bowl of chili that you

40:35.200 --> 40:36.200
have to.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.980
No, this is like condensed.

40:37.980 --> 40:38.980
It's hot.

40:38.980 --> 40:42.120
And like the peppers came out of like special jars and a special liquid.

40:42.120 --> 40:43.640
And he added more peppers.

40:43.640 --> 40:44.640
With gloves.

40:44.640 --> 40:45.640
Yeah.

40:45.640 --> 40:46.640
Yeah.

40:46.640 --> 40:47.640
Removing peppers with gloves.

40:47.640 --> 40:48.640
Yeah.

40:48.640 --> 40:49.640
Yeah.

40:49.640 --> 40:50.640
Removing it.

40:50.640 --> 40:51.640
And then he added more.

40:51.640 --> 40:52.640
So there was like fresh peppers in there too.

40:52.640 --> 40:53.640
It was really.

40:53.640 --> 40:54.640
You'll see in the video.

40:54.640 --> 40:57.400
There's a couple there I think where Richard complains about chewing.

40:57.400 --> 40:58.400
Yes.

40:58.400 --> 40:59.400
Yeah.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.520
He made the fatal mistake of chewing the peppers up.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.760
I made the mistake of licking my lips.

41:03.760 --> 41:04.760
Oh yeah.

41:04.760 --> 41:05.760
Oh yeah.

41:05.760 --> 41:06.760
That's not good.

41:06.760 --> 41:07.760
Absolutely.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.800
Now we've been taking in your feedback about these study groups and I think we're going

41:10.800 --> 41:13.680
to rework them into something bigger and better.

41:13.680 --> 41:16.820
I don't know because we don't have it finalized yet.

41:16.820 --> 41:23.080
So we're going to cancel the study group for next week and we will relaunch study groups

41:23.080 --> 41:24.760
again.

41:24.760 --> 41:27.200
We have the Ansible one I think on the 7th.

41:27.200 --> 41:29.440
I think we're going to leave that one on for now while we're reworking this.

41:29.440 --> 41:30.440
Is that right Elle?

41:30.440 --> 41:31.960
Is it the 7th we're doing Ansible?

41:31.960 --> 41:32.960
First Tuesday of the month.

41:32.960 --> 41:33.960
Oh yeah.

41:33.960 --> 41:34.960
There you go.

41:34.960 --> 41:35.960
That's easy to remember.

41:35.960 --> 41:36.960
First Tuesday of the month.

41:36.960 --> 41:37.960
That's much easier.

41:37.960 --> 41:42.200
And we'll hopefully have our secret plans completed by then.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.200
We'll see.

41:43.200 --> 41:44.200
I think I think people will like it.

41:44.200 --> 41:49.560
The feedback's been super good on the study groups and I think we could do it even make

41:49.560 --> 41:53.000
it an even more consumable way because the reality is, and this is going to be a big

41:53.000 --> 41:57.440
shocker everybody, there's more people that can download it than can attend live.

41:57.440 --> 41:58.440
What?

41:58.440 --> 41:59.440
I know, right?

41:59.440 --> 42:00.440
I know.

42:00.440 --> 42:01.440
I know.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.440
It's crazy.

42:02.440 --> 42:03.920
It's not like we would have ever had metrics or anything else from anything we do that

42:03.920 --> 42:04.920
would suggest that.

42:04.920 --> 42:06.320
No, no, no, no.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.880
So we're going to, but there'll be still a live component and all of that.

42:08.880 --> 42:11.520
But yeah, we're going to rework it with some of that in mind, make it a little more easier

42:11.520 --> 42:15.560
for people to consume because the one that we just published was, it was a hit.

42:15.560 --> 42:20.840
Well, I think it's fantastic, you know, and I'm sure Elle will go into it more and yes,

42:20.840 --> 42:21.840
I'm here.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.840
I can finally like take part in these things.

42:23.840 --> 42:25.400
I'm so excited.

42:25.400 --> 42:29.680
But you know, just what Elle's done just since she's recently joined the network too

42:29.680 --> 42:38.320
and the study groups and rallying people around to help teach and to help create a more positive

42:38.320 --> 42:39.320
community.

42:39.320 --> 42:41.240
And I think that's just, that's fantastic.

42:41.240 --> 42:42.600
She killed it at scale too.

42:42.600 --> 42:44.160
Well, that's, that's what I hear.

42:44.160 --> 42:45.160
That's what I hear.

42:45.160 --> 42:46.160
Hey, which bell was that?

42:46.160 --> 42:47.160
Here we go.

42:47.160 --> 42:48.160
Here we go.

42:48.160 --> 42:49.160
There you go.

42:49.160 --> 42:50.160
It's a real bell.

42:50.160 --> 42:54.040
Yeah, there were some things in the way on that first attempt.

42:54.040 --> 42:55.880
We got to find swag bells.

42:55.880 --> 42:56.880
We got to find swag bells.

42:56.880 --> 42:57.880
That'd be so great.

42:57.880 --> 43:01.680
I'm looking man, you know, but so far it's been like bicycle bells, right?

43:01.680 --> 43:02.680
Yeah.

43:02.680 --> 43:05.560
I think we need the singular ding, not the cha-ching, cha-ching.

43:05.560 --> 43:06.560
Yeah.

43:06.560 --> 43:07.560
Yeah.

43:07.560 --> 43:08.560
We don't want cha-ching, cha-ching.

43:08.560 --> 43:09.560
No, you just want ding.

43:09.560 --> 43:10.560
Yeah.

43:10.560 --> 43:12.920
We're talking about Linux fest Northwest and the scale was great.

43:12.920 --> 43:15.880
We'll, in fact, we'll talk about scale here in just a moment, but before we, before we

43:15.880 --> 43:20.400
get out of housekeeping completely, go check up the meetup page, meetup.com slash Jupiter

43:20.400 --> 43:24.160
broadcasting and just always over there keeping the details up to date for the Linux fest

43:24.160 --> 43:25.480
Northwest meetup.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.240
And so you can track it there.

43:27.240 --> 43:28.680
We got a lot going on.

43:28.680 --> 43:30.200
It's going to be a lot of fun.

43:30.200 --> 43:34.120
Meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting, future study groups also on there.

43:34.120 --> 43:37.000
And when we do meetups at things like scale, those are also on there.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.000
So there you go.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.000
All right, there's housekeeping.

43:39.000 --> 43:47.960
Let's talk about scale and it was a great scale, scale 17 X in Pasadena, California.

43:47.960 --> 43:48.960
Heck of event.

43:48.960 --> 43:52.360
I don't, I didn't ever got a final number on the attendees, but I'm sure it was way

43:52.360 --> 43:54.680
over 5,000, but I don't know for sure.

43:54.680 --> 43:59.800
I, I know they had 33,000 registered attendees, 33,000.

43:59.800 --> 44:00.800
Yeah.

44:00.800 --> 44:01.800
Isn't that crazy?

44:01.800 --> 44:06.280
You guys, you guys can't see in the studio, but I'm like giving Chris the like holy cow

44:06.280 --> 44:07.280
eyes.

44:07.280 --> 44:08.280
Yeah.

44:08.280 --> 44:12.600
And this wasn't my first rodeo, so I'll, I'll go last.

44:12.600 --> 44:16.340
I'd love to hear, I don't know, Wes, quick, I know you cut off a little bit on Coder,

44:16.340 --> 44:20.720
but I'd love to hear a couple of highlights from you and takeaways from scale.

44:20.720 --> 44:24.640
You know, I was really impressed with one, just how welcoming and friendly it was my

44:24.640 --> 44:26.160
first scale.

44:26.160 --> 44:27.260
It was great.

44:27.260 --> 44:31.200
It's kind of in that perfect middle ground between a conference that's big enough that

44:31.200 --> 44:33.920
you can really see the people you want, like Chris, you and I got to see Brendan Craig

44:33.920 --> 44:36.440
talk and that was awesome.

44:36.440 --> 44:39.840
But you know, people afterwards could just go right up and talk to him.

44:39.840 --> 44:44.380
He wasn't totally swamped, really friendly, plenty of time to talk to whoever you want.

44:44.380 --> 44:46.720
And it doesn't feel like a sales push at all.

44:46.720 --> 44:49.960
It's just a bunch of people who love Linux and open source.

44:49.960 --> 44:52.120
Brandon Greg's talk might've been one of my highlights.

44:52.120 --> 44:53.120
Right?

44:53.120 --> 44:54.120
Yeah.

44:54.120 --> 44:57.680
Let me just steal that from you, especially the part where he was live debugging Minecraft,

44:57.680 --> 44:59.680
but had never played Minecraft before.

44:59.680 --> 45:00.680
Yes.

45:00.680 --> 45:01.680
He didn't even know how to mine.

45:01.680 --> 45:02.680
That was amazing.

45:02.680 --> 45:04.800
It was great.

45:04.800 --> 45:09.520
In eBPF, in real time, he's like capturing performance information about Minecraft and

45:09.520 --> 45:14.200
figuring out like where it hangs on the CPU and he builds a fire graph of the different

45:14.200 --> 45:18.640
performance metrics and it breaks down like in red, like the biggest performance issues

45:18.640 --> 45:20.400
and he's like, Oh, need a little more information.

45:20.400 --> 45:21.400
Let's go do this.

45:21.400 --> 45:22.760
Oh, let's go load this library I've built.

45:22.760 --> 45:26.600
And he just does it all right there while he's giving a presentation and it never gets

45:26.600 --> 45:27.600
boring.

45:27.600 --> 45:28.600
Doesn't miss a beat.

45:28.600 --> 45:29.600
Isn't flustered at all.

45:29.600 --> 45:30.600
Really impressive.

45:30.600 --> 45:33.580
And that's like, that's the kind of caliber that you can get at scale, but you don't have

45:33.580 --> 45:37.880
to go to something like OSCON or reInvent and really just hate yourself while you're

45:37.880 --> 45:38.880
there.

45:38.880 --> 45:43.160
I was also impressed that like I just kept seeing organic meetings, like people who had

45:43.160 --> 45:46.920
no idea, had never talked to each other and were helping each other solve problems.

45:46.920 --> 45:52.040
Like I met a great guy, David, who was working in HPC and scientific computing and we were

45:52.040 --> 45:56.360
checking out the open power booth, which was fascinating in its own right.

45:56.360 --> 45:59.960
He had had some trouble with open power trying to get some complicated old fashioned Fortran

45:59.960 --> 46:00.960
programs to compile.

46:00.960 --> 46:02.440
I'm sure many people can sympathize.

46:02.440 --> 46:03.440
Yeah, sure.

46:03.440 --> 46:06.280
And the guy at the booth just offered like, oh, you know, I know another researcher who's

46:06.280 --> 46:07.280
struggled with that.

46:07.280 --> 46:08.420
Let me get you in touch.

46:08.420 --> 46:10.000
He's solved all those problems already.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.000
So I don't know.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.800
I was just really impressed by how friendly and easy everything was and just the great

46:14.800 --> 46:15.860
caliber of people.

46:15.860 --> 46:16.860
And the range.

46:16.860 --> 46:21.680
So here he is using the open power architecture, which we don't talk about very much, solving

46:21.680 --> 46:26.640
Fortran issues.

46:26.640 --> 46:28.800
That's a wide range of scale right there.

46:28.800 --> 46:32.920
So Al, this is also your first scale and I'd love to hear a couple of your highlights and

46:32.920 --> 46:33.920
takeaways from the event.

46:33.920 --> 46:36.940
You know, I think I had the same experience as Wes.

46:36.940 --> 46:41.280
I tackled it a little bit differently being my first time I turned to my Twitter family

46:41.280 --> 46:45.200
and just tweeted out, hey, first time at scale, how does this work?

46:45.200 --> 46:49.680
Within an hour, I was already invited to lunch with a group of scale people who had been

46:49.680 --> 46:51.740
there multiple times.

46:51.740 --> 46:55.160
And throughout the conferences I'm walking by, I have people walking up to me going,

46:55.160 --> 46:56.480
hey, Al, are you finding what you need?

46:56.480 --> 46:57.660
Do you have any questions?

46:57.660 --> 47:01.180
Can I get you a hold, you know, and get you in contact with anyone?

47:01.180 --> 47:03.920
So that kind of community was amazing.

47:03.920 --> 47:08.000
I had another speaker that spoke at the same time as I did and I just randomly tweeted

47:08.000 --> 47:11.200
out, you know, I'm really sad that I'm missing your talk, Justin.

47:11.200 --> 47:13.120
Is there any way I can get your slides?

47:13.120 --> 47:16.960
And he tweets me back and says, I'll be waiting at this table at this time.

47:16.960 --> 47:19.280
Come and ask me all the questions that you have.

47:19.280 --> 47:24.360
So that's the biggest small or the smallest big conference I've ever been to, if that

47:24.360 --> 47:25.360
makes sense.

47:25.360 --> 47:26.360
It does.

47:26.360 --> 47:27.360
And that guy was great.

47:27.360 --> 47:32.080
He was from opensource.com and he had some great questions that, or we had some questions

47:32.080 --> 47:34.400
that he had great answers for, I guess is the way to put it.

47:34.400 --> 47:36.800
It was really, it was really special to get to talk to him.

47:36.800 --> 47:41.000
It definitely was interesting because my takeaway, which I think I told you guys, which is funny,

47:41.000 --> 47:43.480
is I learned that when I grow up, I need to be an avocado.

47:43.480 --> 47:45.480
Now, what's the story behind that?

47:45.480 --> 47:51.620
It was so funny to see that community of community managers coming together and sharing what

47:51.620 --> 47:57.240
information that they've learned about what it means to develop an open source community.

47:57.240 --> 48:00.060
And understanding that, you know what, avocados are expensive.

48:00.060 --> 48:04.560
It's going to cost a lot of money to build a community, but in the end it's worth it.

48:04.560 --> 48:05.560
That's pretty great.

48:05.560 --> 48:06.560
That is pretty great.

48:06.560 --> 48:08.200
So I think you both would recommend going.

48:08.200 --> 48:11.880
I saw in the chat room, people were asking if that's maybe a way to get a job by going

48:11.880 --> 48:12.880
to scale.

48:12.880 --> 48:17.520
Saturday night was the bad voltage live night, which we went to, it was fun, but at the same

48:17.520 --> 48:22.880
time there was a job networking session going on where people that were looking for a job

48:22.880 --> 48:28.320
or had a job were getting together and giving each other tips on resumes and cleaning up

48:28.320 --> 48:30.920
their online profiles and maybe giving better pitches.

48:30.920 --> 48:32.920
So there's a whole range of stuff.

48:32.920 --> 48:34.800
And so I would say yes.

48:34.800 --> 48:38.560
Also a lot of companies are there to recruit.

48:38.560 --> 48:41.740
Because if you are going to an event like that, you're probably in the demographic they

48:41.740 --> 48:43.320
want to hire from.

48:43.320 --> 48:44.320
Yep.

48:44.320 --> 48:50.640
I believe talking with an individual I won't name, but Texas Linux Fest last year, three

48:50.640 --> 48:55.560
individuals from Texas Linux Fest now work here at Linux Academy.

48:55.560 --> 48:56.780
I'm one of them.

48:56.780 --> 48:59.280
As am I, right?

48:59.280 --> 49:00.280
The third person is a mystery.

49:00.280 --> 49:01.280
We don't know who that is yet.

49:01.280 --> 49:02.280
Well, I don't know who that is.

49:02.280 --> 49:03.280
I'm sure someone does.

49:03.280 --> 49:04.280
I do.

49:04.280 --> 49:05.280
Yeah.

49:05.280 --> 49:13.920
But I think that it's definitely a good avenue to go and just to be yourself and ask questions

49:13.920 --> 49:15.400
and not be afraid to ask questions.

49:15.400 --> 49:16.400
Yeah.

49:16.400 --> 49:17.400
It is a good environment for that.

49:17.400 --> 49:23.960
It's not the hokey, I'm on a terminal on the other side of the world and I'm going to give

49:23.960 --> 49:26.240
you some snarky answers, generally.

49:26.240 --> 49:30.080
It's generally someone who cares and is willing to help you out.

49:30.080 --> 49:34.320
With that, though, I will say if you're attending, you have to be willing to go up and talk to

49:34.320 --> 49:35.320
people.

49:35.320 --> 49:37.400
You know, the job isn't just going to fall in your lap.

49:37.400 --> 49:42.080
So it is a little bit of vulnerability of just walking up and starting conversations and

49:42.080 --> 49:43.520
doing a hallway track.

49:43.520 --> 49:44.520
That's a good point.

49:44.520 --> 49:48.880
I think the nice thing is with the caliber of people, sure, that can be really nerve-wracking

49:48.880 --> 49:51.960
and scary, but everyone there is basically like you.

49:51.960 --> 49:55.320
They're all interested in the same stuff and really friendly.

49:55.320 --> 49:56.320
Even the speakers.

49:56.320 --> 49:59.860
Like, you know, we had, Wes and I had a moment of celebrity with Brandon Gregg because we've

49:59.860 --> 50:04.800
been following the incredible work he does as a Netflix performance engineer.

50:04.800 --> 50:09.640
And you get a real sense of the gift that Netflix has given to the community by allowing

50:09.640 --> 50:13.820
him to open source his work because it's amazing.

50:13.820 --> 50:17.840
Having him do that with Minecraft using open source tools that are available to all of

50:17.840 --> 50:24.160
us and the functionality and features that eBPF is going to bring to Linux, incredible.

50:24.160 --> 50:28.800
And to watch him go through it and you realize he is a geek about this.

50:28.800 --> 50:30.240
He is super passionate.

50:30.240 --> 50:33.320
He gets excited about finding performance issues.

50:33.320 --> 50:36.880
And he is just somebody who's gotten over the fear of talking to people.

50:36.880 --> 50:38.320
And now he's at a point where he's a great presenter.

50:38.320 --> 50:39.320
Absolutely.

50:39.320 --> 50:45.020
And to Elle's point, too, is that if you're at one of these conferences and you see somebody

50:45.020 --> 50:50.220
that maybe might be an outlier, bring them over.

50:50.220 --> 50:53.040
You never know who you're going to meet there.

50:53.040 --> 50:57.960
And it's not always easy for someone to socially interact.

50:57.960 --> 51:00.800
Not everybody can just jump right into that.

51:00.800 --> 51:06.960
And if you see somebody, bring them into your circle and try and strike up conversation

51:06.960 --> 51:12.840
with them, and who knows what impact you're going to make on their life just by reaching

51:12.840 --> 51:13.840
out to them.

51:13.840 --> 51:16.640
So I think you definitely need to consider those things as well.

51:16.640 --> 51:20.480
I think Chris and Wes will speak to, if I'm at that conference, ping me.

51:20.480 --> 51:25.240
I will definitely bring you along and introduce you to people.

51:25.240 --> 51:27.560
It's one of the great parts of being part of this community.

51:27.560 --> 51:28.560
Just follow the hair.

51:28.560 --> 51:34.720
Yeah, that is so many times I found Elle in a crowd because of that hair.

51:34.720 --> 51:36.640
Mr. Popey gave a talk, which we attended.

51:36.640 --> 51:37.920
That was great.

51:37.920 --> 51:39.880
Try to link that in the show notes.

51:39.880 --> 51:44.180
The way they did it, it's a little complicated for getting the content after the fact.

51:44.180 --> 51:48.040
But they had YouTube channels for each room that was streaming live.

51:48.040 --> 51:52.160
It's like Ballroom A, Ballroom B, Ballroom C, D, E, F.

51:52.160 --> 51:57.760
And so not all of the talks were live, but a lot of them were live, and in various production

51:57.760 --> 51:58.760
states.

51:58.760 --> 52:02.440
But you can go back to those YouTube channels and skim the days and find some of the talks

52:02.440 --> 52:03.440
and stuff.

52:03.440 --> 52:06.240
But Popey's is linked in there, and it looks like he got that in there.

52:06.240 --> 52:08.680
We'll try to put that in the show notes.

52:08.680 --> 52:10.320
I had a great scale.

52:10.320 --> 52:15.200
I really focused on the hallway track, which is a silly thing.

52:15.200 --> 52:19.320
I always thought the people that did this were being lazy and wasting an opportunity

52:19.320 --> 52:22.440
because the talks are very valuable.

52:22.440 --> 52:28.160
But over the years that I've gone, I've realized it's the people and it's the only time I get

52:28.160 --> 52:29.640
to see some of these people.

52:29.640 --> 52:33.000
And that has become more and more important as time has gone on.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.720
And then the talks are kind of secondary to me now.

52:35.720 --> 52:37.640
So I didn't go to as many this year.

52:37.640 --> 52:42.160
Also, I felt like not as many of them applied to me.

52:42.160 --> 52:46.320
It felt like if there was a theme, which they don't have themes, but if you were to grok

52:46.320 --> 52:52.540
a theme by looking at all of the talks and aggregating it, it would be the cloud.

52:52.540 --> 52:54.640
Scale was really about the cloud.

52:54.640 --> 53:01.480
I mean, there was people giving talks about desktop stuff and applications and hardware.

53:01.480 --> 53:02.480
So it's not all cloud.

53:02.480 --> 53:04.560
It's not like it's 100% cloud.

53:04.560 --> 53:08.000
But if you were to if you were to abstract an overall theme, it would be the cloud is

53:08.000 --> 53:13.000
everywhere from the exhibition hall to the talks, cloud, cloud, cloud, in a way that

53:13.000 --> 53:16.560
kind of gave me a little bit of pause like, oh, man, we are really watching an era.

53:16.560 --> 53:18.480
This is a this is a changing of an era now.

53:18.480 --> 53:19.480
Yeah, right.

53:19.480 --> 53:21.960
I mean, the keynote was was the founder of HashiCorp.

53:21.960 --> 53:23.720
So that kind of sets the tone.

53:23.720 --> 53:24.720
Yeah.

53:24.720 --> 53:26.120
Now, of course, there was a lot of open source in there.

53:26.120 --> 53:29.640
So don't think it's just like cloud corporate side, but still right.

53:29.640 --> 53:33.540
They managed to strike that balance better than any other event.

53:33.540 --> 53:37.840
It's like one of the commercial ones, like the cons, LinuxCon, OSCON, they they weigh

53:37.840 --> 53:41.520
heavily on the commercial side because it's for enterprises, people in it.

53:41.520 --> 53:45.780
The tickets are like a thousand dollars for some of these events worth scale.

53:45.780 --> 53:49.320
The community is the one submitting the talks.

53:49.320 --> 53:51.080
So they're the ones setting the theme and the tone.

53:51.080 --> 53:55.380
It's what the community contributes is what the show or the expo becomes.

53:55.380 --> 54:00.520
So it is just a reflection of where the market's at now that that was fascinating.

54:00.520 --> 54:03.920
I got to go hands on with a couple of pieces of hardware that I wanted to try.

54:03.920 --> 54:05.040
That's what I was going to ask you about.

54:05.040 --> 54:12.360
Like, you know, the conferences, the few that I've been to, I've gone to the talks, but

54:12.360 --> 54:14.920
I'm always the nerd for the floor, right?

54:14.920 --> 54:16.880
Like what's their hardware wise?

54:16.880 --> 54:18.040
Oh, the expo hall?

54:18.040 --> 54:19.040
Yes.

54:19.040 --> 54:24.440
And so I'm really curious how does scale stack up in their expo hall compared to, say, some

54:24.440 --> 54:25.520
of the other conferences?

54:25.520 --> 54:26.520
I like it.

54:26.520 --> 54:31.320
They generally have along the outlies of the expo hall, like the open source projects,

54:31.320 --> 54:35.440
your inkscapes, your open seuses, your foundations, your next clouds, whatever.

54:35.440 --> 54:36.440
Yeah.

54:36.440 --> 54:39.760
And then in the middle, you've got high end commercial booths.

54:39.760 --> 54:46.800
I'm talking like high production, like booths with beer caps, plush carpet, a mirror, did

54:46.800 --> 54:51.040
you see that mirror picture I tweeted of a of a tux penguin made out of optron cores?

54:51.040 --> 54:52.040
Yeah.

54:52.040 --> 54:53.040
Yeah.

54:53.040 --> 54:54.040
Made out of optron processors.

54:54.040 --> 54:59.720
And then like the Microsoft booth was one of the booths I stopped by, super swanky lighting,

54:59.720 --> 55:05.200
great comfy carpet, and they had the Azure Sphere OS dev kit devices there.

55:05.200 --> 55:10.120
So I got to go hands on with the little Azure Sphere OS, which is Linux based, and some

55:10.120 --> 55:14.960
example hardware where it was like, this one I think was like a washing machine interface

55:14.960 --> 55:17.320
that was actually controlled by an Azure Sphere OS.

55:17.320 --> 55:18.320
Wow.

55:18.320 --> 55:21.160
And I mean, not only were we getting a spiel about it, right, but we were interacting with

55:21.160 --> 55:24.600
one of the developers who's been working on stripping Linux down enough to make it run

55:24.600 --> 55:26.200
on those kinds of platforms.

55:26.200 --> 55:27.200
Mm hmm.

55:27.200 --> 55:28.200
Mm hmm.

55:28.200 --> 55:32.120
And and got to talk to the Visual Studio program manager and got a little bit of back and forth

55:32.120 --> 55:38.680
regarding the new Windows open sourced calculator, gave him a hard time about that.

55:38.680 --> 55:43.120
So it was actually one of my favorite booths because they had a Linux running device they

55:43.120 --> 55:46.920
were showing off they were they were talking about some of the new things they're doing

55:46.920 --> 55:49.740
and they just open sourced the calc.exe app.

55:49.740 --> 55:51.200
So it was it was kind of fun.

55:51.200 --> 55:54.700
The other booth I really enjoyed, I mean, there were so many.

55:54.700 --> 55:56.720
But the other one that I really enjoyed was Purism.

55:56.720 --> 55:57.720
Yeah.

55:57.720 --> 56:01.000
Got to talk to Todd Weaver a couple of times did bumped him and bumped into him in the

56:01.000 --> 56:02.560
hotel as well.

56:02.560 --> 56:08.200
And I talked to their chief security guy, his name is Kyle, and he went over how they're

56:08.200 --> 56:12.720
using the Purism secure boot system, how it uses your GPG keys to sign things.

56:12.720 --> 56:16.560
So things are signed with your GPG stuff, how the hardware token works into that.

56:16.560 --> 56:18.740
And we talked a little bit about their convergence efforts.

56:18.740 --> 56:22.080
Then I got to hold the development kit for the Liebman five in my hands, which was like

56:22.080 --> 56:23.080
a brick.

56:23.080 --> 56:24.080
Yeah, it was a brick.

56:24.080 --> 56:26.720
Yeah, well, it was a big, big brick that didn't power on.

56:26.720 --> 56:30.280
Did you did you have and this is, you know, kind of one of the things that I was curious

56:30.280 --> 56:37.320
about a scale to did they have like pine 64 there with their quote unquote, I didn't

56:37.320 --> 56:38.320
see pine 64.

56:38.320 --> 56:39.320
No device.

56:39.320 --> 56:42.600
But there were some other hardware devices there, but I didn't see pine 64 more mobile

56:42.600 --> 56:43.600
hardware devices.

56:43.600 --> 56:47.200
I'll tell you the one that impressed me the most is the one Wes was talking about a little

56:47.200 --> 56:51.320
bit earlier, the the open power architecture booth.

56:51.320 --> 56:56.080
We talk a lot about future desktops that are based on ARM processors or what risk five

56:56.080 --> 56:58.080
might develop into one day.

56:58.080 --> 57:04.200
But these guys have power PC based desktops that are modern processors with, as he puts

57:04.200 --> 57:05.960
it just monster IO.

57:05.960 --> 57:09.880
And it was just like a real Linux desktop running right there on a rapture workstation,

57:09.880 --> 57:11.040
which was I'd never seen one in person.

57:11.040 --> 57:12.040
It was really cool.

57:12.040 --> 57:18.880
With like a real video card, like an AMD video card in there and like PCI slots and memory

57:18.880 --> 57:25.000
slots like a like a like a desktop tower running open running the open power power PC architecture.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.000
That's awesome.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.000
Yeah, it was actually really cool.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.680
It's something people don't talk a lot about.

57:28.680 --> 57:29.680
Part of it's the price.

57:29.680 --> 57:33.880
I'm sure a little expensive, like that rig he had there was like over $3,000.

57:33.880 --> 57:39.280
So yeah, I mean, but if you look at that and say look at a specked out, you know, or something

57:39.280 --> 57:40.280
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

57:40.280 --> 57:44.040
You know, I forgot to ask about the fan noise because boy, wouldn't that make a nice studio

57:44.040 --> 57:45.040
machine?

57:45.040 --> 57:50.240
Yeah, no, I guess the unlike risk five, like the whole architecture isn't open source for

57:50.240 --> 57:51.240
open power.

57:51.240 --> 57:54.200
IBM, though he seemed to think maybe one day IBM might.

57:54.200 --> 57:58.240
So there was I mean, there were so many cool booths got to bump into Jordan from Linux

57:58.240 --> 57:59.240
game cast.

57:59.240 --> 58:00.240
That was really cool.

58:00.240 --> 58:04.000
I got to meet him in person and they were at the Lutris booth.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.280
Lutris had a booth there.

58:05.280 --> 58:10.600
So that was really cool and saw Jill from their from their weekly show that they do

58:10.600 --> 58:16.520
and got to chat with them tons and tons of audience members and we had a great meetup

58:16.520 --> 58:23.760
over 30 people showed up for our dinner, which a PF Chang's left me with the bill.

58:23.760 --> 58:24.760
We go up we go there.

58:24.760 --> 58:27.960
This is actually I don't think you don't think Emma would mind me telling the story because

58:27.960 --> 58:29.400
it was so no so bad.

58:29.400 --> 58:30.400
She's awesome.

58:30.400 --> 58:31.400
Yeah.

58:31.400 --> 58:32.400
So we get there.

58:32.400 --> 58:33.400
And we asked the waiter like can you split the check?

58:33.400 --> 58:34.400
Oh, yeah.

58:34.400 --> 58:35.400
We asked the waiter like can you split the check?

58:35.400 --> 58:36.400
Okay.

58:36.400 --> 58:37.400
Well, how we can split it two ways.

58:37.400 --> 58:40.200
Well, I'm looking there's like there's like 32 of us there.

58:40.200 --> 58:41.200
Right.

58:41.200 --> 58:42.200
I'm like, that's not gonna work.

58:42.200 --> 58:44.520
And Emma's like, oh, no, I'm not having this.

58:44.520 --> 58:45.720
She's like computers can do this.

58:45.720 --> 58:47.600
I'm gonna go talk to the manager.

58:47.600 --> 58:52.720
So she gets up and she's gone for like, five, six minutes, seven minutes long enough that

58:52.720 --> 58:54.960
you know, she's having a conversation with somebody.

58:54.960 --> 58:57.640
She gets back and she kind of has like this little frustrated look on her.

58:57.640 --> 58:58.640
I'm like, what?

58:58.640 --> 59:01.640
Because it's like, didn't go well, like, what's the matter?

59:01.640 --> 59:05.560
They'll only split it four ways now, like, okay, so I'm sitting there doing the math.

59:05.560 --> 59:07.720
I'm like, well, which four suckers get stuck with the bill?

59:07.720 --> 59:09.440
Like, how are we going to spread around cash?

59:09.440 --> 59:11.040
Like, how are we going to do this, right?

59:11.040 --> 59:13.680
But as the night goes on, when you got a big group of people, we're getting taught, we're

59:13.680 --> 59:17.360
getting you know, we're drinking, we're talking loud, we're taking up a lot of space.

59:17.360 --> 59:19.640
They have a shift change.

59:19.640 --> 59:21.720
And the new waiter, he's not having any of it.

59:21.720 --> 59:24.600
He's because he has inherited a mess.

59:24.600 --> 59:26.160
The old waiter was great.

59:26.160 --> 59:32.440
Like, he was playing a long troll on us on one side of the table, he'd have an accent.

59:32.440 --> 59:33.600
That took us way too long to figure out.

59:33.600 --> 59:35.280
It was like, what is going on here?

59:35.280 --> 59:36.280
Yeah.

59:36.280 --> 59:37.960
And the other side of the table, no accent.

59:37.960 --> 59:40.640
I had that happen here at a Dunkin.

59:40.640 --> 59:41.640
Really?

59:41.640 --> 59:42.640
Yeah.

59:42.640 --> 59:43.640
A Dunkin Donuts?

59:43.640 --> 59:44.640
Yes.

59:44.640 --> 59:45.640
Well, it was pretty funny.

59:45.640 --> 59:48.280
Like, it had us, you know, we were like, sorry, everybody's like listening every time he

59:48.280 --> 59:49.280
came up.

59:49.280 --> 59:50.360
But he got shift changed.

59:50.360 --> 59:51.360
New guy came up.

59:51.360 --> 59:52.360
He wasn't having the bill split at all.

59:52.360 --> 59:56.240
I wonder if the new guy came up because he knew that he wasn't going to get the gratuity

59:56.240 --> 59:57.240
level.

59:57.240 --> 59:58.240
Right?

59:58.240 --> 59:59.240
Yeah.

59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.240
Right?

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.240
So he's like, no, guys.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.240
Yeah.

01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.240
Yeah.

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.240
That guy had invested.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.240
He had invested in it.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:06.240
Or the original waiter was just smart enough to get out of there before he had to deal

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.240
with any of our unhappiness about the bill.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:12.240
I had a lot of good fun, though.

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.720
It was a good night.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.280
And it was good to see everybody again.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.280
I do think four days is a lot for scale.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:22.200
You know, I think they could do it in two or three, cut a few talks, do it in two or

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.200
three days.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.200
Maybe two days would be perfect.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.200
Boy, by the end, yeah.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.200
It really feels like a slug.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.400
Even though you're having fun the whole time, it's just so much.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:30.400
Yeah.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.520
Now our attention turns to Linux Fest Northwest.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.480
Linux Fest Northwest coming up.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.480
So excited.

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.480
Texas Linux Fest coming up.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.480
Yeah.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.480
All of the Linux Fest coming up.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.480
Yeah.

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.480
Yeah, you're going to be there for Linux Fest Northwest.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.480
Yeah.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.480
About damn time.

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.480
Oh, that's awesome.

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:44.480
About damn time.

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.480
I know.

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.480
I'm super excited.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.480
It'll be my first time in Washington state as well.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:48.480
Wow.

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:52.160
And, well, one of the things that I did want to note that I noticed, because I was so jealous,

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.800
and then following you guys on Twitter, seeing all the things that were going on, I guess

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.880
one day you guys decided to take Elle to the Pacific Ocean.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:00:59.880
She had never seen the Pacific Ocean.

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:02.520
I thought that was great.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.760
But I'm looking forward to getting up there in Washington and checking it out too.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.640
So the amazing part of that is, I don't think that was a decision made.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.160
It's we're all headed back to the hotel to go to bed.

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.920
And I'm like, oh, I've never seen the ocean.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.160
And the next thing I know, we're in a car headed to the ocean.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.160
I like it.

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.640
You've got to do that, right?

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:18.640
Absolutely.

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:24.120
I think when she comes up to Washington, and you too, we should go visit some mountains.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.360
Real mountains.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.360
Real mountains, yeah.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:30.080
I called the hills mountains in California, and I'm never going to live that down.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:31.080
I wasn't having it.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.080
I wasn't having it.

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.560
I mean, California has a few mountains.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.560
Don't get me wrong.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.560
But not where we were.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:36.560
Not in LA.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.600
Not where we were at in Pasadena.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.600
Yeah.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.600
Good times.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:43.440
And if we didn't get a chance to see it scaled this year, maybe we'll get to see it at Linux

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.440
Fest Northwest.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.440
I know.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:47.280
I don't want people to feel like they're left out.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.280
But it is a lot of fun.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.720
And if you ever have the opportunity, I encourage you to take it.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.320
What do you say we do a few emails before we get out of here?

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.320
All right.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.640
One comes in from Ken about trying out software.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:59.800
And I wanted to read this one on the show because we've gotten variations of this email

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.520
over the years.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.200
And I can't quite remember if we've ever taken a crack at actually answering it.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.480
So he says, hey, Chris and team, I've been a regular listener now for over a year to

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.000
a number of the programs.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.520
I'm intrigued by many of the software picks.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:18.400
But even though I'm tempted to try it, I'm always concerned about how easy it might be

01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:21.920
to delete or clean off my system after I'm done with it.

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.260
I don't want a lot of leftover junk.

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:27.560
Can you give me some insight about how you usually handle this?

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:32.780
I'd rather not have to nuke and pave the OS over and over to ensure a stable system.

01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:35.320
Do snaps insulate you from the main OS?

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.560
Does this solve this problem?

01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:40.640
I'm inclined mostly just to install things inside a VM or not using known boxes or virtual

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.720
box and play with it there.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.260
On the other hand, I'm guessing I'm not really getting a true sense of the performance of

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.380
these apps.

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:49.760
So I thought maybe you could discuss this on the show.

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:54.000
We do install a lot of software for this show and we all know that feeling of, oh, my system's

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
so gross now.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.240
Well, and what was it last week?

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.240
Dot file nightmares?

01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.240
Yeah.

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:00.240
Yeah.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.240
I know.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.240
Right.

01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.240
Sort of.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.240
I mean, this kind of really plays into that.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.240
Damn it.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.240
You're right.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.240
So I'm not going to lie.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:14.660
I don't tend to uninstall often unless it is a real flop, then I uninstall it.

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:20.060
But because this space is cheap and it's generally using shared libraries that are already on

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:24.400
my system, once I've got the bulk of things installed, the cost of leaving it on there

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.080
is generally negligible.

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:31.040
Other than it's an entry in my software package database, which then has to then get updates

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.320
and things like that, which is kind of annoying.

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:37.120
Usually when I'm doing updates and I notice a program go by that I never, ever, ever use,

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.960
I usually contemplate removing it.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:42.640
But I will admit I kind of err on the side of just not bothering with it.

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:43.720
What about you, Wes?

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:46.280
These days, mostly I'm using Docker.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:50.040
It's pretty easy to pass, like your Xsocket or you can do it with Wayland, too.

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:52.680
So there's really no reason not to use Docker.

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:55.480
If you're already familiar with that tool and you want to try something out, especially

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:59.000
if it's on a different distro, that's really handy.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.560
Sometimes you'll get like little weirdnesses with, you know, toolkits and stuff.

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.680
So if you're going for like a really visual app, OK, maybe not.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:05.760
But that's one step.

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.800
And Ken, to answer your question, definitely go behind our show notes.

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:12.040
Watch Popeye's talks, because yes, snaps can help.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.000
Of course, you have to depend on that package being snapped.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
But once it is, and if it's not a legacy app, yeah, you don't have to worry about your system

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
when you install it.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.200
Yeah, that is.

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:23.120
That's a great plug for the old talk there.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.120
Nice call there, Wes.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.120
Nice call.

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.400
I was curious about you, Brent.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.800
Do you try to avoid installing software?

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.040
Do you install it and then leave it?

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.040
What's your approach?

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:36.280
I certainly don't try to avoid installing software because that's the best way to discover

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.160
new things.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:42.280
But I'm like you, if I see a piece of software scrolling by weekly and when I'm doing my

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:46.400
updates that I never use, I tend to lean to try to take it off.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:50.680
And if you're running like an Ubuntu based distribution, they make it pretty easy to

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:53.120
at least like purge packages and stuff like that.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:58.840
And I haven't had too many problems with the package manager uninstalling something useful

01:04:58.840 --> 01:04:59.840
in that process.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:06.680
It's been actually fairly smooth to kind of install stuff, uninstall stuff and just try

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:11.080
to keep things down to only the programs I'm using.

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:15.820
But I would say I've never run into a real problem with anything getting totally messed

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.820
up because of trying software.

01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:22.000
One thing too that makes me think of is it's often handy to have a good idea of what your

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.200
base is, whether that's in something like Ansible or just a bash script or just a list

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:28.460
of packages that you want on every system.

01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:31.440
Because then whenever you are back to nuking and paving or you just want to try another

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.760
distro, it's not as much work to get all set up.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.000
And backups, everyone.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Good backups.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.180
Yeah, backups do help.

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:43.120
And your package manager should warn you if it's about to do something that's going to

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:45.640
like uninstall the GNOME desktop or something like that.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.520
Yeah, it really pays to pay attention to what it's trying to tell you.

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:53.400
I've been caught a few times when it's trying to install like 400 packages just for a simple

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.680
application or something.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:57.360
And so yeah, read, read things.

01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:58.640
That's really important.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.640
Yeah, read it.

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:04.500
And I might say last, my last bit of advice would be give it a go because this is how

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:05.960
you learn.

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:10.320
You know, if you do break it, just like Brent says, make sure you got good backups and you

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.280
probably won't ever make that mistake again.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:16.600
Maybe not that particular one, but you will most definitely make more mistakes and break

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:17.600
the things in the future.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.640
Hopefully, if you're having fun.

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.800
It is okay to fail sometimes.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:25.840
I think that's a future topic that L suggested at scale that I like it is like we should

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.800
tell a few stories where we tried to do something and it blew up horribly in our face.

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.440
Like try to learn something new and it just didn't work out.

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:34.960
In fact, I'd love to get that as a feedback item too.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.160
I'd read a couple of those.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:40.540
If you want to share some with the class, go to linuxunplug.com slash contact and send

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:41.960
in your training fail.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:45.240
And I think especially the early day fails.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:51.080
What were some of your fails in the early days and maybe even, you know, in the 90s,

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:52.080
right?

01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:57.640
In the early 2000s when there wasn't really all that documentation, right, and you failed

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.640
miserably.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.640
Where did you go?

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.640
Yeah.

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:01.640
You know, how did you fail?

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.640
It happens.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:03.640
Super interesting to hear those stories.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:07.400
I remember having to go into school and look up stuff on the internet and take it home

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.760
with me for the next day.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:12.160
So he printed it out.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.160
Yeah, I love it.

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:19.520
Man, you know what I used to do back in the late 90s, early 2000s before we really had

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.520
great search engines.

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.720
We had search engines, but nothing to write home about.

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:27.520
And we had a monthly book trip that we would go on.

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.880
And we would each get to go and there was an IT budget for books and we would go pick

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:31.880
out a book.

01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:32.880
Wow.

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.560
And so that's where you acquired all your nutshell books?

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:36.560
Oh, yeah.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.560
So many.

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:39.920
We had so many shelves of books back then.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:40.920
It was really crazy.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:42.600
Of course, when I left, there were all the company's books and I don't know what they're

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.240
doing with all the probably fire starter now.

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.240
All right.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:51.600
Another email of the show comes in from Paul following up on our home automation topic.

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:56.320
Paul writes, as always, like the show, the bit about home automation, I thought I would

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:59.280
mention, there's something else you could look at.

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:01.400
It's called Node-RED.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:05.480
It's a great way to self-document all your automation using a GUI flow chart.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.480
It's very powerful.

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.640
I've only recently started to use it on my Ubuntu box at home.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:16.060
I connected it easily to my Echo and I also connected it to my Broadlink IR Blaster.

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:17.060
This is neat.

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:19.000
So this is something else to put on our list, Wes.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Yeah.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.280
I haven't played with it before, but looking at it, gosh, the GUI looks wonderful.

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.440
It's just very intuitive.

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:28.080
You can tie things together and it turns out just Googling around for some examples, a

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.240
lot of people are using it.

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:32.280
It's really popular as part of the home assistant community.

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:36.880
So like there's a couple of YouTubers, Dr. Z's is a good one that has some stuff on it.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.240
So take a look at that.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:42.480
Oh, when I get back, we're going to get that home automation system finished up in the

01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.480
studio.

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.480
We'll have to call it studio automation.

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:45.480
Yeah, it will be.

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:46.480
Of course.

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:47.480
I'm really looking forward to it.

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:50.600
Well, I'll just mention, I meant to mention earlier, if you want to see a picture from

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:54.400
our meetup and stuff, I have a link in the show notes to the picture that System76 tweeted

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.920
out of the meetup and a good group there.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.280
It's just so much fun.

01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:59.280
So much fun.

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.280
But it's good to be back.

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:05.760
Good to be back in the studio and back to regular shows for a bit, at least for a little

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:06.760
bit.

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:07.760
We'll see.

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.920
I'm going to be hitting the road soon actually and traveling back to Washington.

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:09.920
Yeah.

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:10.920
What are you talking about?

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:11.920
Normalcy.

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:12.920
You don't have that.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:13.920
I know.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.920
Actually, yeah.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:15.920
It's going to be a road for the show.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.200
It'll probably be a road show.

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.320
So yeah, nothing normal.

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.320
Nothing normal about that.

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:22.480
It's going to be crazy, but you should join us live and find out if we managed to pull

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:24.320
it off over at jblive.tv.

01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:25.320
We do it on Tuesdays.

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:29.200
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get it converted to your local time.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:32.520
It's 4 p.m. Central, 2 p.m. Pacific.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:35.280
Those are the two that I follow the most closely.

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.080
Mr. West, where can people go get more Westpain?

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.200
At Westpain or check out techsnap.systems.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.560
Oh, what about you, Mr. Bacon?

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.560
You got anything you want to play?

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.000
They can just go to atcheesebacon on Twitter.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Boom.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Check that out.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
What about you, Elle?

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000
You want to plug your Twitter handle?

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.880
I'm at L underscore O underscore punk.

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:53.880
That's L O punk.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:55.360
Owning those underscores there.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.760
Owning those underscores.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:57.760
And me?

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.760
Well, thanks for asking.

01:09:58.760 --> 01:09:59.760
I'm at Chris Elias.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.240
The network at Jupiter Signal.

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:06.760
Our website linuxunplugged.com, linuxunplugged.com slash contact for your feedback.

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:07.920
Let me know your training fail.

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:11.020
Maybe we'll cover that on a future episode of the Unplugged program.

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.940
And maybe consider joining us in our virtual Lug.

01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:18.200
You can Google, probably the easiest way to do it, Jupiter Colony Mumble.

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:21.120
You'll get all the information, the setup guide, how to get in there.

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:26.800
We just ask that you have a headset, some microphone that works, and a way to hear us.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:27.800
Pretty simple to participate.

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.000
And then you can get your opinions in the show.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.200
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:11:02.760
And we'll see you right back here, next Tuesday!

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:19.840
All right, now we just got to name this thing and we're done for the day.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:20.840
Hey Brent, what's the name?

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:21.840
Yeah, come on Brent, yeah.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.840
Amazing.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:23.840
I got a few entries in there.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:24.840
Oh, did you?

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:25.840
Good.

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:26.840
Good.

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:27.840
Brent's back.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.840
Everybody's back.

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:32.200
We miss you so much when you're gone.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.560
Today we'll surf the net.

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:34.560
That's not bad.

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.560
It's not bad.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.120
Debby and his children's also pretty good.

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.420
Oh, let's see.

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:40.820
We talked about scale too, so we could have scale in there.

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:42.960
I can't wait to step out of this hot box.

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:43.960
I cannot wait.

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.460
It's going to be glorious.

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:47.760
We should go outside for like a solid five minutes.

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.040
We should make a couple of laps around the building here.

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.040
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.280
Yeah, there is a possibility of tornadoes happening I think tomorrow morning.

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.640
Oh my gosh.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.720
I think tomorrow Chris and I are going to, because we're staying in the same hotel right

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:00.720
now.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.480
We're just going to scrap all of this and go like tornado hunting.

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.480
Be safe now.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.480
That would be awesome.

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:06.480
Yeah.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.040
That would be so great.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.040
New podcast.

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.040
Yeah.

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.760
Jupiter Broadcasting's Tornado Hunter.

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:14.360
It's very windy for the podcast, but if you can listen through that-

01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:15.360
Yeah, audio not so good.

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.360
Yeah, audio not so great.

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:34.360
Yeah, audio not so great.
