This is Linux Unplugged Episode 18 for December 10th, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.320
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux doc show that currently

00:40.320 --> 00:43.300
has more raw computing power than the NSA.

00:43.300 --> 00:44.640
My name is Chris.

00:44.640 --> 00:45.640
My name is Matt.

00:45.640 --> 00:52.760
And I'm surrounded right now by, let me count them down, one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:52.760 --> 00:53.760
seven screens.

00:53.760 --> 00:54.760
Wow!

00:54.760 --> 00:55.760
That's a lot of screens.

00:55.760 --> 00:59.020
Yeah, that's a lot of computers right now, so we're in the middle of this big hardware

00:59.020 --> 01:03.440
roundup where we're reviewing different gadgets from System76, different machines.

01:03.440 --> 01:06.200
And I just hooked up today the Leopard Extreme.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.640
I actually hooked it up late last night.

01:08.640 --> 01:11.560
So they sent it to me with 64 gigabytes of RAM.

01:11.560 --> 01:12.560
Oh!

01:12.560 --> 01:15.960
You gotta love that, you know?

01:15.960 --> 01:18.960
And I'm just going to tell you too, I decided to go for it.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.360
I installed Arch on the Ultra Pro.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.360
Nice, good choice.

01:22.360 --> 01:26.040
Yeah, so I got KDE 4 with Arch and I actually went a different direction this time.

01:26.040 --> 01:29.160
I had problems with Integros, like the, I don't know if it was the repos or what was

01:29.160 --> 01:31.000
going on, the install wasn't working.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.600
I love Integros, but it just wasn't working out.

01:33.600 --> 01:34.740
What exactly were you experiencing?

01:34.740 --> 01:36.480
Was it just not installing, like crashing?

01:36.480 --> 01:38.760
It would get like, no, no, it was fine, it was fine.

01:38.760 --> 01:42.640
It would get through like 70, 80% of the installation process and then it would just seem to start

01:42.640 --> 01:44.000
timing out and pulling down a package.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.040
I don't know if it was the Arch repo issue at the time or what it was.

01:47.040 --> 01:52.520
So I jumped over and tried out Bridge Linux, which is sort of along the same vein as Integros

01:52.520 --> 01:56.600
in the sense that they use straight Arch repos and they let you pick like your different

01:56.600 --> 02:01.880
desktop and they let you choose KDE right out of the box, which is what I wanted.

02:01.880 --> 02:07.920
It's definitely not quite as smooth as Integros, like it's a straight up command line installer,

02:07.920 --> 02:10.200
but it has like an Ncurses interface.

02:10.200 --> 02:11.900
Not bad.

02:11.900 --> 02:16.360
It's a little more, it's definitely for more power users, it's not quite as user friendly

02:16.360 --> 02:20.580
as Integros is, but I got it installed and now I have a completely current Arch installation

02:20.580 --> 02:24.200
and it took about 25 minutes, so it was an interesting experiment because I'd never tried

02:24.200 --> 02:25.200
it.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.200
Yeah, it's interesting.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.200
I'm going to have to check that out myself.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.800
One of the other things I thought was kind of interesting, to overuse the word already,

02:31.800 --> 02:37.080
is I also tried Manjaro, but Manjaro suffered from the same exact problem Integros did.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.080
Did it really?

02:38.080 --> 02:40.400
That's why I was thinking it might have been a repo issue.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.400
It must be.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.400
Yeah.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.400
I mean, it's really hard to say exactly what was going on.

02:43.400 --> 02:48.280
The only thing I've ever experienced as far as a Manjaro versus Integros situation was

02:48.280 --> 02:54.280
that one Ethernet, that one Broadcom Ethernet driver issue to where Integros was not having

02:54.280 --> 02:58.160
it and it couldn't install because, get this, it couldn't get to the Internet.

02:58.160 --> 03:03.480
Of course, there was no detection on the wireless front and of course, you're not getting any

03:03.480 --> 03:05.320
love on the Ethernet front.

03:05.320 --> 03:08.360
It kind of means you can either go the long way through Canvas, personally it would just

03:08.360 --> 03:12.000
be easier to install Arch at that point, but I just went with Manjaro on it and it worked

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
out okay.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.120
Well, so I want to apologize up front.

03:15.120 --> 03:20.080
I'm not really so sick anymore, like I feel fine, but I still have some junk in my throat

03:20.080 --> 03:24.000
and it's fine unless I talk, which is not really…

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
That could be a problem.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.520
Actually, when I think about it, it's kind of a problem.

03:26.520 --> 03:29.600
So you might hear, I'll try to mute my mic from time to time, but I do have a little

03:29.600 --> 03:30.600
junk in there.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.080
That'll give you an opportunity to yammer on.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.080
Yeah, that's true.

03:33.080 --> 03:37.840
And you know, I have, it's not the best solution, people, but it's all I have to

03:37.840 --> 03:41.680
work with is a little 100 proof peppermint schnapps.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.680
You can see it's already working.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.840
It's got the tongue feeling good.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.880
So I'll be sipping on that as the cough comes up.

03:46.880 --> 03:50.680
But I wanted to touch on something before we go on, Matt, because I have a little more

03:50.680 --> 03:57.020
things to say on the System76 stuff, but of course, as is to be expected on the internet,

03:57.020 --> 04:02.680
there was a critique and of course, Stowolf2 in our subreddit who saw it fit to post the

04:02.680 --> 04:07.720
same thing twice in the thread, said that the whole show was more or less a big commercial

04:07.720 --> 04:08.720
this time.

04:08.720 --> 04:12.360
This is, he's talking about our System76 laptop special from season 29 episode 10 of

04:12.360 --> 04:14.000
last that came out on Sunday.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.960
I really hope it won't take that long before they're finished this because I have no interest

04:16.960 --> 04:18.560
whatsoever with this kind of thing.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.480
I really hope they got paid quite a bit.

04:20.480 --> 04:23.600
I'm willing to go through a couple of them if it means shows will continue, but I cringe

04:23.600 --> 04:29.160
myself the whole time wanking off a sponsor the whole episode this week.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.440
So I think there's a bit of an assumption here that this was a paid.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.440
Yeah.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.480
And that's, well, first of all, there was no wanking that was happening to my knowledge,

04:36.480 --> 04:38.960
at least I didn't get anything there.

04:38.960 --> 04:43.440
But no, I would definitely say that this is based on the fact that we're celebrating and

04:43.440 --> 04:47.040
reviewing hardware that is built to run Linux.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.440
Yes, they are a sponsor.

04:48.440 --> 04:53.760
Yes, I've also been using myself as have you been using these guys long before the Linux

04:53.760 --> 04:55.600
eyes ever on the Linux action show.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.240
So I've been promoting them way before I had anything to do with them.

04:59.240 --> 05:02.760
So these are products and services, these are products we're actually excited about.

05:02.760 --> 05:06.360
So at least from my perspective, and that's what we're doing.

05:06.360 --> 05:10.320
That's exactly it.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.880
There's no exchange of money.

05:12.880 --> 05:17.040
When I asked to be sent these computers, we didn't tell them how to spec them or anything

05:17.040 --> 05:18.040
like that.

05:18.040 --> 05:19.040
We don't get to keep them.

05:19.040 --> 05:20.040
I mean, God, that'd be awesome.

05:20.040 --> 05:24.600
And I also would argue, I don't think we got necessarily preferential treatment either.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.360
I think we, you know, there's just as they became available, they were sent to us.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.360
Right.

05:28.360 --> 05:29.360
Yeah.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.360
Yeah.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.360
And there was a waiting list.

05:31.360 --> 05:32.360
Yeah.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.360
And it really and you'll notice.

05:33.360 --> 05:37.600
So the way the system 76 sponsorship works is system 76 sponsors a particular segment

05:37.600 --> 05:43.440
and not the entire show and we move that segment sponsorship out of the system, the review

05:43.440 --> 05:45.440
like we'll do next week when we're talking about the leopard extreme.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.440
Absolutely.

05:46.440 --> 05:50.320
And another thing that happened on Google Plus and I'm finally glad is taking place

05:50.320 --> 05:53.000
is the old, well, they're rebranded such and such and whatnot.

05:53.000 --> 05:58.440
And I'm really excited to see that Carl came out of the woodwork and actually address this

05:58.440 --> 06:02.080
and I'll actually provide it maybe in the show notes as to what he responded to.

06:02.080 --> 06:05.320
But he was actually talking about, you know, what makes them different, how, you know,

06:05.320 --> 06:08.960
what system 76 does to actually ensure that they're compatible.

06:08.960 --> 06:10.960
The custom bios, hand to hand.

06:10.960 --> 06:11.960
Right.

06:11.960 --> 06:12.960
The hardware keys for the function keys.

06:12.960 --> 06:13.960
Yeah.

06:13.960 --> 06:14.960
Exactly.

06:14.960 --> 06:15.960
Right.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.080
And in case of my bonobo, the modification so that the GPU would work properly under

06:17.080 --> 06:19.600
Linux and not just under Ubuntu but all Linux, right?

06:19.600 --> 06:23.680
Which was later on, I mean at the time I bought it to run Ubuntu but then later on I decided

06:23.680 --> 06:24.740
to run Arch.

06:24.740 --> 06:27.920
So there's all this stuff that they don't spend, because, you know, this is of no value

06:27.920 --> 06:30.380
to you guys to sit there and for them to ramble on about all this stuff.

06:30.380 --> 06:33.540
But this is all the stuff that's actually happening behind the scenes that make these

06:33.540 --> 06:35.400
guys unique.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.560
And I think it's pretty exciting.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.120
So are they Clivo based?

06:39.120 --> 06:40.120
Yes.

06:40.120 --> 06:41.120
That's the base, right.

06:41.120 --> 06:42.120
Yeah, they're based.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.940
But there's a lot of extra stuff there you're not seeing.

06:43.940 --> 06:48.360
But unfortunately it's easier a lot of times to, from an easy chair to point and go, it's

06:48.360 --> 06:49.360
just rebranded.

06:49.360 --> 06:54.440
So there's changes at the hardware level, but then there's also there's the support

06:54.440 --> 06:58.100
angle of it, which for some folks matters a lot more than other folks.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.680
What I come back to at the end of the day is the strongest statement we can make as

07:00.680 --> 07:03.520
Linux users, and this is one of the reasons why even though I don't play all of them,

07:03.520 --> 07:07.420
I often pick up a Steam game, is there is nothing more powerful than Linux users voting

07:07.420 --> 07:08.420
with their wallet.

07:08.420 --> 07:12.120
And in the Linux ecosystem, especially in the free software world, there's not always

07:12.120 --> 07:15.600
a lot of opportunities to clearly make your voice be heard.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.480
And the thing is, is one of the reasons why I've been buying, and they don't sponsor this

07:19.480 --> 07:20.480
show, right?

07:20.480 --> 07:21.480
Right.

07:21.480 --> 07:22.480
Exactly.

07:22.480 --> 07:23.480
They don't sponsor Unplugged.

07:23.480 --> 07:24.480
I can say whatever I want.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.840
But the truth is, the reason why I've been buying them for seven, eight years is because

07:26.840 --> 07:32.040
that money goes into a company that then continues to push the desktop Linux agenda forward,

07:32.040 --> 07:33.040
right?

07:33.040 --> 07:34.040
Right.

07:34.040 --> 07:38.640
And so the thing is, is I know, for example, a lot of people love Lenovo ThinkPads, and

07:38.640 --> 07:42.600
they probably are, I don't actually, I haven't had one for a while, but they often are very

07:42.600 --> 07:43.600
good hardware.

07:43.600 --> 07:47.960
But the problem at the end of the day is that purchase is actually voting for the Windows

07:47.960 --> 07:54.280
desktop, because they're not counting it as like an Ubuntu desktop machine.

07:54.280 --> 07:55.280
They're not counting it like that.

07:55.280 --> 07:58.720
Because on top of that, there's the aspect of the interaction with the community, with

07:58.720 --> 08:02.200
the drivers, the Ubuntu forums, and all of that that I really respect.

08:02.200 --> 08:05.640
I respect a company that actually follows the community and doesn't just get Linux,

08:05.640 --> 08:07.860
but actually actively participates in it.

08:07.860 --> 08:12.560
And it's not that I, no disparity for anybody that wants to buy a Lenovo.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.480
You buy whatever hardware works best for you.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.640
Everybody, I mean, I've got Macs in the studio, okay?

08:16.640 --> 08:19.080
So I understand there's hardware out there that does what you need to do and you need

08:19.080 --> 08:20.080
to buy it.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.720
My point is, is that is a vote.

08:22.720 --> 08:28.280
And that's like when I do decide to buy a Mac, that internally for me is a very long

08:28.280 --> 08:34.800
process of reflection that I go through and I spend way more time than I should like specking

08:34.800 --> 08:39.120
out a Hackintosh, trying to figure out how to not vote with my wallet, because that is

08:39.120 --> 08:40.120
the most powerful vote.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.960
And that's another reason why I like System76 quite a bit.

08:42.960 --> 08:47.520
And all of that plays a factor into when I look at a System76 unit and I think, you know,

08:47.520 --> 08:52.060
this is something for Linux and how good is it in that context?

08:52.060 --> 09:01.000
And that's why for me, Ultra Pro, not only did it change my perspective on Ultrabooks,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.440
because obviously somebody has the Bonobo, I'm kind of as much power as I can cram in

09:04.440 --> 09:05.440
there.

09:05.440 --> 09:09.600
But it also changed my perspective on Intel graphics, which I think in the long run is

09:09.600 --> 09:13.680
going to be the biggest thing I carry forward from this review is just how far the Iris

09:13.680 --> 09:15.200
graphics have come.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.840
And again, the Linux games aren't the most demanding games on the market.

09:18.840 --> 09:22.700
I really haven't seen anything that the 680 and my Bonobo can't just chew through without

09:22.700 --> 09:23.920
ultimate settings.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.400
So it's maybe not a fair test.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.560
Maybe it wouldn't perform as well under Windows.

09:27.560 --> 09:28.560
I don't know.

09:28.560 --> 09:29.560
I didn't try.

09:29.560 --> 09:37.360
But I loaded Half-Life 2 on this Ultra Pro under Arch using Steam and it was butter smooth.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.800
I didn't even adjust any of the video settings.

09:38.800 --> 09:42.840
I just wanted to get in game and see like could I get enough frame rates to actually

09:42.840 --> 09:44.440
expect to be able to shoot somebody.

09:44.440 --> 09:47.800
And it was like it was as if I was playing on an embedded video.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.880
And I understand that Half-Life 2 is not, you know, it didn't just come out.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.240
It's not the most current game.

09:52.240 --> 09:56.160
But at the same time, the way I look at it is if you're looking at getting an Ultra

09:56.160 --> 09:59.460
Book, gaming for you is probably not the first priority.

09:59.460 --> 10:01.920
It's probably more like something you do on a social occasion.

10:01.920 --> 10:02.920
And I think…

10:02.920 --> 10:03.920
It's secondary, yeah.

10:03.920 --> 10:04.920
Right.

10:04.920 --> 10:08.840
It's something you might like to be able to do, but it's not going to decide the purchase.

10:08.840 --> 10:13.020
And I feel like the embedded graphics are now at that level and that's extremely exciting

10:13.020 --> 10:17.760
for me because Intel graphics are a cheap, they're low power.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.840
If you consider the Intel chip too.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.800
And also open source, the drivers, right?

10:22.800 --> 10:24.760
So you have open source drivers, which is great.

10:24.760 --> 10:28.600
And not only do we have open source drivers, but Intel has shown us that they will work

10:28.600 --> 10:32.160
with the Linux kernel team one generation out.

10:32.160 --> 10:36.480
So while one generation is on the market, before Haswell even hit the stores, they already

10:36.480 --> 10:38.380
had drivers into the Linux kernel.

10:38.380 --> 10:40.560
And to me, that's huge.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.540
So I'm really excited to see where that goes.

10:42.540 --> 10:44.940
And so they haven't paid for any special treatment.

10:44.940 --> 10:46.800
We asked to be sent the hardware.

10:46.800 --> 10:52.600
We wanted to check it out because in both Matt and I's opinion, this is the premier

10:52.600 --> 10:54.160
Linux hardware vendor.

10:54.160 --> 10:59.320
Well, in my own personal desktop computers and old, I mean, hell, I've got my laptop

10:59.320 --> 11:00.320
behind me from 2008.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.320
It's a system 76.

11:01.320 --> 11:02.320
It still works.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.560
I've got a pile of laptops in front of me from other companies that don't work any

11:05.560 --> 11:06.560
longer.

11:06.560 --> 11:09.520
So I think the quality is certainly reasonable in that regard.

11:09.520 --> 11:14.120
And I've had good experiences with them coming from an old PC repair background and watching

11:14.120 --> 11:18.840
people buy crap and then get all butthurt over it when their stuff doesn't work anymore.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.760
I really value quality.

11:21.760 --> 11:26.680
I don't want to, and that's not just the product, but also the service and the way I'm treated.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.320
And that's a big part of it for me as well.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.320
Yeah.

11:29.320 --> 11:36.120
So on my Google Plus page, I posted some hardware porn of the intern of the leopard extreme.

11:36.120 --> 11:38.520
And this is a really well-built computer.

11:38.520 --> 11:42.680
And I'm looking at it as a Mac Pro competitor.

11:42.680 --> 11:50.040
So the unit they sent me, 64 gigs of RAM and a six core Intel i7 processor.

11:50.040 --> 11:55.120
What I want to try to figure out is a lot of, once I'm done editing a show, I hand it

11:55.120 --> 11:58.180
off to FFmpeg on different computers throughout my house.

11:58.180 --> 12:04.120
And through benchmarks, I've determined which computers are best at encoding which versions.

12:04.120 --> 12:09.200
Some are better at shrinking video down and then putting out an iPod friendly format.

12:09.200 --> 12:14.480
And some are better doing just straight encoding to 720p with no scaling.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.480
And it's all-

12:15.480 --> 12:16.480
Oh, that's interesting.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.480
Yeah.

12:17.480 --> 12:20.840
So you're saying that different machines actually specialize more so in different encoding techniques

12:20.840 --> 12:21.840
than other machines.

12:21.840 --> 12:22.840
Right.

12:22.840 --> 12:23.840
Yeah.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.040
And so I'm wondering where this thing falls down.

12:25.040 --> 12:30.640
So what would be incredible, and I don't actually know if it can be accomplished, is if this

12:30.640 --> 12:35.520
machine could make web and video encoding economical.

12:35.520 --> 12:41.440
Because right now, what happens on the Jupiter Broadcasting website is I post a show and

12:41.440 --> 12:45.920
I usually use the YouTube embed for sometimes a couple of days because the web and video

12:45.920 --> 12:49.600
takes so long to encode that I often just don't get back to it till a couple of days

12:49.600 --> 12:50.600
down the road.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.200
So I can't use HTML5 video.

12:52.200 --> 12:56.760
And so I'm hoping that this might be the machine that makes webM doable.

12:56.760 --> 12:57.760
We'll see.

12:57.760 --> 12:58.760
I don't know yet.

12:58.760 --> 13:01.640
I got a lot of things I'm going to be throwing at it, but it's pretty cool.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.360
I got it under my desk right now sitting right next to me.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.800
And I got a nice Logitech G19 keyboard hooked up to it.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.400
So I'm like, I'm full in.

13:08.400 --> 13:09.400
Yeah.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.400
I'm enjoying it.

13:10.400 --> 13:11.400
All right, Matt.

13:11.400 --> 13:12.960
Well, we got a couple of emails we should get into.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.720
The first one is getting girls on Linux.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.720
This was a response to some comments we made on a recent show.

13:17.720 --> 13:18.880
Did you want to read this one?

13:18.880 --> 13:19.880
Yeah.

13:19.880 --> 13:20.880
Let's get over to that.

13:20.880 --> 13:21.880
Girls on Linux.

13:21.880 --> 13:22.880
Getting girls on Linux.

13:22.880 --> 13:23.880
Okay.

13:23.880 --> 13:26.360
Getting girls, which I think was a pickup from a topic we touched on last week.

13:26.360 --> 13:27.360
Yeah.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.360
Okay.

13:28.360 --> 13:30.080
So I'm going to try not to butcher this here as we go.

13:30.080 --> 13:34.880
As a female who discovered Linux in college, I wanted to add my own response to the questions

13:34.880 --> 13:37.080
on how to get girls to use Linux.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.080
Okay.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.080
Interesting enough.

13:39.080 --> 13:43.680
The most important reason for someone to switch – I'm reading word for word, so it's

13:43.680 --> 13:45.040
going to be a little bit short.

13:45.040 --> 13:52.480
The most important reason for someone to switch OS is not who will be doing their tech support.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.320
So okay, I think basically what they're saying with that was regarding the tech support.

13:55.320 --> 13:56.320
Okay.

13:56.320 --> 13:57.320
Moving on to the next piece.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.600
It is how – let me make that bigger so I can see it.

13:59.600 --> 14:00.880
Hang on just a minute.

14:00.880 --> 14:01.880
Probably reread that.

14:01.880 --> 14:02.880
All right.

14:02.880 --> 14:03.880
Let's try it again.

14:03.880 --> 14:04.880
Let's see.

14:04.880 --> 14:08.160
It is how they switch that will make their life easier.

14:08.160 --> 14:12.360
Any female studying STEM in college – I studied physics and used tons of open source

14:12.360 --> 14:17.640
software in my research – using Linux is a great way to separate yourself when applying

14:17.640 --> 14:18.640
for research positions.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.440
That's actually a really good point.

14:20.440 --> 14:21.440
Okay.

14:21.440 --> 14:25.440
It also offers some awesome creative outlets for other majors as well.

14:25.440 --> 14:31.200
Liberal arts students should love the freedom and ideals that Linux offer to the user.

14:31.200 --> 14:35.520
Most importantly, it can save them a ton of money, which is also true.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.520
Great point.

14:36.520 --> 14:37.520
Yeah.

14:37.520 --> 14:38.520
Excellent point.

14:38.520 --> 14:39.520
Okay.

14:39.520 --> 14:40.520
I know it wasn't your intention to demean women.

14:40.520 --> 14:45.600
However, let's stop focusing on women as outliers who need a different type of convincing

14:45.600 --> 14:48.680
than men on why to use Linux.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.000
The benefits of Linux apply to all genders equally.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.200
I think that really summarizes in that last sentence.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.200
Yeah.

14:54.200 --> 14:57.240
I think this is something, too, that really resonated with me.

14:57.240 --> 15:01.020
I kind of feel like it's insincere when a bunch of guys talk about how to get women

15:01.020 --> 15:02.020
into technology.

15:02.020 --> 15:03.020
That kind of seems like –

15:03.020 --> 15:07.520
I can't speak for you, Chris, but I know talking with my wife, there is absolutely

15:07.520 --> 15:08.520
a thing there.

15:08.520 --> 15:13.920
Not because she's a woman, but because she looks at task management and various things

15:13.920 --> 15:18.040
differently than I do because hold on to your hats, kids, because of gender.

15:18.040 --> 15:22.960
I think it's interesting because at one end, what's going to draw women into technology?

15:22.960 --> 15:26.200
It's going to be the same thing that draws men into technology, but when you look at

15:26.200 --> 15:30.880
the actual end-use cases like in the home, my wife and I use technology very differently.

15:30.880 --> 15:34.680
I would even say my wife's more effective with technology than I am in a lot of ways

15:34.680 --> 15:36.520
because she does tend to work smarter.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.640
I'm the guy that does multiple trips to bring groceries into the house when she will

15:39.640 --> 15:42.040
find a way to do it in one or two trips.

15:42.040 --> 15:46.840
There's definitely an effectiveness there, but I think at the end of the day, I see what

15:46.840 --> 15:50.420
they're saying, but I definitely think that there are differences and they can be embraced

15:50.420 --> 15:52.920
in a healthy, non-negative way.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.080
One thing I wanted to clear up is I think there was a misunderstanding.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.280
She said one of the things, what's going to make women switch is who's going to be their

15:58.280 --> 15:59.280
tech support.

15:59.280 --> 16:02.800
I didn't mean it as in women will switch to whatever the men will help them with.

16:02.800 --> 16:05.860
What I mean is usually when you're switching to something new, you're going to have the

16:05.860 --> 16:10.040
most success when other people in your immediate social group also use that same technology

16:10.040 --> 16:15.920
so that way they can share experiences or provide insights when you get stuck somewhere.

16:15.920 --> 16:19.840
I don't think it necessarily depends on, although in a sense, I guess that does mean who's going

16:19.840 --> 16:20.840
to be the tech support.

16:20.840 --> 16:25.480
But at the end of the day, honestly, if we want to really quit trying to be politically

16:25.480 --> 16:30.260
correct and be honest with ourselves, there are some things, like I'm very good at certain

16:30.260 --> 16:32.120
things that my wife's not good at.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.580
My wife's very good at things that I'm not good at and they're not necessarily gender

16:34.580 --> 16:37.200
specific, but some of them are.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.640
Some of those things, like for instance, when it comes to actually planning out the layout

16:40.640 --> 16:43.120
of our home, that was my wife.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.160
You guys are like peanut butter and jelly.

16:45.160 --> 16:46.160
I know, right?

16:46.160 --> 16:50.000
I mean, at the end of the day, it's like I don't want to be too sensitive about this

16:50.000 --> 16:54.240
because it just doesn't really add any value to it.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.880
Yeah, I don't know.

16:55.880 --> 16:56.880
It's a tough call.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.920
I definitely hear what she's saying and she's got some great points.

16:58.920 --> 17:02.920
I definitely like the benefits of all genders equally, but I think there are inherent differences

17:02.920 --> 17:05.920
that we can embrace and do so in a positive way.

17:05.920 --> 17:12.520
So moving on as a follow-up thread to the topic of swap partitions, we had a lot of

17:12.520 --> 17:13.520
interesting facts.

17:13.520 --> 17:15.000
I've got a couple I'll get to here.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.920
Panda Brain wrote and he said in the debate last week, no one mentioned swap files.

17:19.920 --> 17:24.080
Those are files that can be used for the same things as a swap partition is used for, i.e.

17:24.080 --> 17:26.560
offloading content from memory and hibernation.

17:26.560 --> 17:30.680
Unlike swap partitions, they can be created, removed, or resized on the fly.

17:30.680 --> 17:35.160
There is no real disadvantage unless you use ButterFS, which just simply doesn't support

17:35.160 --> 17:36.160
them.

17:36.160 --> 17:39.680
You'll find more information about swap files in the always excellent Arch Wiki, and he

17:39.680 --> 17:42.160
has a link to that.

17:42.160 --> 17:45.160
So the swap partition thing, it's so funny.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.160
Gosh.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.520
Yeah, you really opened up a can of worms with that one.

17:48.520 --> 17:52.520
If this was a Windows podcast, it would be our should I defragment my drive topic.

17:52.520 --> 17:55.640
This is something Linux users pine over all the time, and you know what?

17:55.640 --> 17:59.680
I think SSDs have made it even more... Now everybody's like, well, now I don't have very

17:59.680 --> 18:00.680
much space.

18:00.680 --> 18:03.720
I've only got 128 gigabytes of space.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.560
Should I really give several gigabytes to my swap file?

18:06.560 --> 18:08.080
What am I even using that for?

18:08.080 --> 18:09.400
I've got eight gigs of RAM.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.600
That's what everybody's thinking.

18:12.600 --> 18:18.560
There are ways to take advantage of hibernation without the swap file.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.880
But it probably requires a little bit of research.

18:20.880 --> 18:23.820
You actually got to kind of plan out what your goals are and decide which approach is

18:23.820 --> 18:24.820
best for you.

18:24.820 --> 18:25.820
So yeah, there's a little bit of homework involved.

18:25.820 --> 18:26.820
Yeah, yeah.

18:26.820 --> 18:31.260
We're going to get to the topic of the swap file again, but I wanted to read some feedback

18:31.260 --> 18:36.840
we got from Ray, which I had actually been meaning to personally write Ray back, but

18:36.840 --> 18:40.280
I just haven't done it yet, so this will be the first time I've addressed him.

18:40.280 --> 18:45.320
Ray wrote into the show and he said, hey Chris, I'm one of the golden ticket winners from

18:45.320 --> 18:46.320
Ting.

18:46.320 --> 18:50.720
I just wanted to say how happy I am I have switched to their service.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.640
So I wanted to say thank you, Ray, for doing this.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.360
This is an excellent point.

18:54.360 --> 19:00.400
So Ting is sponsoring this episode of Linux Unplugged and I have to tell you, I am a big

19:00.400 --> 19:01.400
fan of Ting.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.560
I've been telling you about Ting for a while now and I think they're a great company.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.600
It's not just that I like their service and it's not just that I like their pricey model

19:07.600 --> 19:11.520
and it's not just that they have no contracts and no early termination fees and that I own

19:11.520 --> 19:14.080
the phone and that hotspot and tethering are included.

19:14.080 --> 19:19.520
And honestly, all of those things are what got me to switch to Ting, but they're not

19:19.520 --> 19:20.920
what keeps me at Ting.

19:20.920 --> 19:25.560
What keeps me at Ting is the fact that I'm, again, voting with my wallet and I'm giving

19:25.560 --> 19:28.320
my money to a company that I'm really passionate about.

19:28.320 --> 19:32.280
So Ray Roni says, I signed up through the last URL and I purchased a Nexus S with a

19:32.280 --> 19:33.280
$25 discount.

19:33.280 --> 19:34.280
Nice.

19:34.280 --> 19:37.640
Yeah, you can get that same discount by going to linux.ting.com.

19:37.640 --> 19:41.200
He says, the phone arrived sooner than I expected and I couldn't be happier after working out

19:41.200 --> 19:45.120
a few bugs with tech support and later a new battery that cleared up some problems.

19:45.120 --> 19:53.180
It's been a little tight on cash flow for a long time and I have an $85 phone that has

19:53.180 --> 19:58.560
4G and it's near showroom-like condition plus a $400 credit that I will cover my cost for

19:58.560 --> 20:01.240
my Ting plan for the next year.

20:01.240 --> 20:05.520
He was on an Android 2.2.2 device before that his dog had slobbered up a little bit.

20:05.520 --> 20:06.520
Whoa.

20:06.520 --> 20:07.520
Yeah.

20:07.520 --> 20:08.520
He said, I'd have been...

20:08.520 --> 20:10.800
By the way, he got to use Nexus S, which is a really great way to save money when you're

20:10.800 --> 20:11.800
switching to Ting.

20:11.800 --> 20:15.640
He said, I would have been without a personal phone by the end of October if not taking

20:15.640 --> 20:18.200
advantage of the deal and the affordable service.

20:18.200 --> 20:22.360
I'm blessed with grateful and willing budgeting for my next device on Ting sometime next year,

20:22.360 --> 20:23.680
maybe the Nexus 5.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.680
So get started by going over to linux.ting.com.

20:26.680 --> 20:27.860
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

20:27.860 --> 20:31.000
They're my mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.960
Personally I've got the HTC One and the Nexus 5 on Ting service and it's awesome because

20:35.960 --> 20:39.320
they have a great dashboard that lets me see exactly where each phone is at.

20:39.320 --> 20:42.740
I can put one phone on suspend if I'm not going to use it for a little while.

20:42.740 --> 20:45.640
There's tons of really nice things in the Ting dashboard, but really the great thing

20:45.640 --> 20:47.680
about Ting is you only pay for what you use.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.620
They take your messages, your minutes, and your megabytes and they add them all up at

20:50.620 --> 20:53.180
the end of the month, whatever bucket you fall into.

20:53.180 --> 20:54.440
That's just what they charge you for.

20:54.440 --> 20:58.480
You want to turn on tethering for a little while, do it because son, it's only $6 a month

20:58.480 --> 21:01.680
flat and then you only pay for what you use on top of that.

21:01.680 --> 21:04.920
Average Ting bill is between $21 and $33 a month.

21:04.920 --> 21:05.920
Think about that.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.280
What are you paying right now on your smartphone?

21:07.280 --> 21:10.920
Go over to linux.ting.com and click that how much would you save button right in the middle

21:10.920 --> 21:12.080
of the page.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.860
Put your current stuff in there.

21:13.860 --> 21:14.860
Just put your bill in there.

21:14.860 --> 21:15.860
I'm not judgy.

21:15.860 --> 21:18.800
Just put your bill in there and see how much you're paying right now and compare that to

21:18.800 --> 21:23.720
Ting because I've got Hotspot and tether, I've got an up to date Android phone that

21:23.720 --> 21:27.980
is awesome that I own, that I only pay for what I use and I have no contract and there's

21:27.980 --> 21:29.280
no early termination fee.

21:29.280 --> 21:33.260
I'm truly in control and as these mobile devices become more popular, as this computing platform

21:33.260 --> 21:37.080
becomes the norm, these are the little details that will matter the most.

21:37.080 --> 21:40.360
You can get started by going to linux.ting.com and don't worry, if you're in a contract

21:40.360 --> 21:46.320
right now, Ting has an early termination relief program and they'll take up to $75 per line

21:46.320 --> 21:47.320
that you have to cancel.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.320
It's super easy.

21:48.320 --> 21:51.420
All you have to do is go over to Ting, get your phone, port your number and then submit

21:51.420 --> 21:52.420
your ETF claim.

21:52.420 --> 21:53.960
That's early termination fee.

21:53.960 --> 21:57.000
Submit your ETF claim to Ting and they'll take care of you.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.640
So, go get started by going to linux.ting.com and a huge thanks to Ting for sponsoring

22:01.640 --> 22:05.400
Linux Unplugged and congratulations to Ray for becoming a golden ticket winner.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.880
Isn't that awesome?

22:06.880 --> 22:07.880
You know, it's so cool.

22:07.880 --> 22:12.760
It is so cool and also, I don't want to steal thunder, but we have a little announcement

22:12.760 --> 22:14.680
to make on the Fo' Show.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.280
Somebody just got a whole bunch of service too.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.840
Alright, so let's get back on this topic.

22:18.840 --> 22:19.840
I got a big one.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.200
I got a big one on swap files, Matt.

22:22.200 --> 22:23.480
Are you ready for a little more?

22:23.480 --> 22:24.520
I think I'm ready.

22:24.520 --> 22:25.520
I can only imagine.

22:25.520 --> 22:29.800
So, there's only one way to take a swap conversation and make it better and that's to bring in

22:29.800 --> 22:31.320
ZRAM and Hibernate, right?

22:31.320 --> 22:33.280
I mean, that's really going to take the next...

22:33.280 --> 22:34.280
Oh no.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.280
Oh boy.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.280
That's just really over-complicating.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.280
Oh my goodness.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.280
Okay.

22:38.280 --> 22:39.280
Alright, so Kevin writes in.

22:39.280 --> 22:40.280
Hey Kevin.

22:40.280 --> 22:41.280
He says, Hi Chris and Matt.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.520
I'm glad you brought up the topic of swap.

22:43.520 --> 22:47.760
Despite the beardiness of the topic, it's something I've been following since SSD price

22:47.760 --> 22:53.600
drops and 2GB of RAM have made a swappable system not just possible, but perhaps desirable.

22:53.600 --> 22:57.120
With the community having a greater experience about it, I wanted to toss around a few ideas

22:57.120 --> 22:58.800
to the Jupyter broadcasting audience.

22:58.800 --> 23:03.440
Alright, Matt, so I'm going to activate our Mumble Room for this one too so that way they

23:03.440 --> 23:04.440
can answer.

23:04.440 --> 23:05.440
Alright.

23:05.440 --> 23:07.840
So, question number one and I pose this to the Mumble Room.

23:07.840 --> 23:12.560
I've heard good things about ZRAM, but I don't want to spare a machine to test on it yet.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.840
Has anyone replaced your swap file with ZRAM?

23:15.840 --> 23:17.680
Will it work with Hibernation?

23:17.680 --> 23:21.580
Is performance under heavy load better than disk-based swap?

23:21.580 --> 23:23.800
Anyone in the Mumble Room tried ZRAM yet?

23:23.800 --> 23:25.800
If only Ant was here.

23:25.800 --> 23:35.760
I tried it on, I have an AC100, which is a Toshiba ARM-based laptop shipped with Android

23:35.760 --> 23:41.920
and we replaced Android with Ubuntu and memory was a bit tight.

23:41.920 --> 23:50.000
So we used ZRAM or ZRAM as we call it over here and really didn't notice any difference

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
at all.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
It's fine.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.240
And how much RAM do you think the system, do you remember how much it had in it, physical

23:55.240 --> 23:56.240
RAM?

23:56.240 --> 23:57.240
A gig.

23:57.240 --> 23:58.240
Oh gosh, I have no idea.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.240
Okay.

23:59.240 --> 24:00.240
Two, five, six maybe.

24:00.240 --> 24:04.240
It's either 512 or a gig because I remember looking at it, it's a Tegra 2-based system.

24:04.240 --> 24:05.720
Yeah, it's pretty lean.

24:05.720 --> 24:06.720
Yeah.

24:06.720 --> 24:07.720
Okay.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.800
The other thing to note is that ZRAM does not fix the Hibernation problem.

24:10.800 --> 24:11.800
Oh, okay.

24:11.800 --> 24:12.800
Yeah.

24:12.800 --> 24:13.800
Okay.

24:13.800 --> 24:14.800
This period does not fix it.

24:14.800 --> 24:15.800
Okay.

24:15.800 --> 24:19.040
There is no way to currently hibernate, which does not require you to write to disk at some

24:19.040 --> 24:20.800
point your contents of RAM.

24:20.800 --> 24:21.800
Right.

24:21.800 --> 24:22.800
Because you're powering down the RAM.

24:22.800 --> 24:23.800
Exactly.

24:23.800 --> 24:24.800
Yeah.

24:24.800 --> 24:25.800
Another thing.

24:25.800 --> 24:30.520
No, I don't get why there isn't some solution that creates like on Windows creates a Hibernation

24:30.520 --> 24:36.000
file separate from swap if you don't wish to have a large swap file that matches the

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
amount of RAM you have.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
Yeah, let's go.

24:38.000 --> 24:44.600
Another thing I've been noticing just on my main machine is that ever since kernel 3.8

24:44.600 --> 24:48.440
for some reason, ZRAM causes a kernel panic when enabled.

24:48.440 --> 24:49.440
What?

24:49.440 --> 24:54.720
And sometimes just randomly it'll kernel panic and I don't even know why.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.520
What distro is this?

24:56.520 --> 24:57.520
Any distro.

24:57.520 --> 24:59.440
With anything after 3.8?

24:59.440 --> 25:00.440
Anything after 3.8.

25:00.440 --> 25:01.440
That is weird.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.440
Linus, dammit.

25:02.440 --> 25:03.440
No.

25:03.440 --> 25:08.080
Okay, now here's, let's talk about swap files specifically.

25:08.080 --> 25:12.240
So Kevin wants to know, is there a big difference between swap files and swap partitions?

25:12.240 --> 25:17.000
If the system partition and swap are on the same disk, I can't see where an improvement

25:17.000 --> 25:21.240
would be, especially since I could remove or add swap files with much less hassle than

25:21.240 --> 25:23.800
a swap partition.

25:23.800 --> 25:27.240
Now I have a theory, but has anybody actually tried swap files?

25:27.240 --> 25:28.240
No.

25:28.240 --> 25:32.120
All right, so here's my theory on the swap partition.

25:32.120 --> 25:35.720
This is just a raw space that the kernel can write to.

25:35.720 --> 25:40.320
And I gotta believe that is faster than going through the file system driver and whatever

25:40.320 --> 25:45.020
it is, BotRFS extended for, I have to believe it is a much more direct connection when you

25:45.020 --> 25:50.960
have a raw partition space that is just only for swap.

25:50.960 --> 25:51.960
That would be my belief.

25:51.960 --> 25:52.960
You would think so.

25:52.960 --> 25:55.720
Yeah, I mean, you would think it would be a straighter shot anyhow.

25:55.720 --> 25:56.720
Yeah.

25:56.720 --> 26:01.100
All right, so he goes on to ask about USB 3.0 flash drives being cheap enough and maybe

26:01.100 --> 26:02.320
storing swap on there.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.320
No.

26:03.320 --> 26:08.060
See, the one problem with USB is that it uses the CPU for the controller logic, so you're

26:08.060 --> 26:09.640
gonna have CPU load for doing that.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.360
I just don't think that's a good idea in general.

26:11.360 --> 26:15.720
He said, it sounds like some of the Mumble members would go swappless if not for Hibernate,

26:15.720 --> 26:20.160
and he includes a link where we can find out more information from the Debian Wiki.

26:20.160 --> 26:21.160
How about that?

26:21.160 --> 26:22.160
A plug for the Debian Wiki.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.160
Woo!

26:23.160 --> 26:27.600
On at least running Debian Hibernate without a official swap file.

26:27.600 --> 26:28.600
So there you go.

26:28.600 --> 26:31.320
All right, so he says, thanks for relieving my ramblings.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.840
Well, Kevin, thank you for emailing in.

26:32.840 --> 26:33.840
That was a good one, right?

26:33.840 --> 26:34.840
Yeah, very good.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.640
I thought that was a good little topic.

26:36.640 --> 26:37.640
All right.

26:37.640 --> 26:38.640
Really well thought out too, I think.

26:38.640 --> 26:42.680
Yeah, it's funny how, like, there's just the semantics, you know, where you think about

26:42.680 --> 26:43.680
these kind of things.

26:43.680 --> 26:47.320
Like, honestly, when I was resetting up this Ultra Pro, I was like, should I make a swap

26:47.320 --> 26:48.320
partition?

26:48.320 --> 26:49.320
Right?

26:49.320 --> 26:50.320
Yeah, exactly.

26:50.320 --> 26:51.320
Yeah.

26:51.320 --> 26:52.320
Yeah.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.720
Unless you're running, like, openSUSE and you just import what you're working with.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.960
Yeah, I mean, I decided to go for it, but yeah.

26:55.960 --> 26:56.960
Okay.

26:56.960 --> 26:57.960
All right.

26:57.960 --> 27:00.760
Well, I wanted to remind everyone that we'll be doing a double recording on Tuesday the

27:00.760 --> 27:02.640
17th, starting at 12 p.m.

27:02.640 --> 27:03.640
So we're gonna start early.

27:03.640 --> 27:04.640
Oh, boy.

27:04.640 --> 27:05.640
Don't forget, man.

27:05.640 --> 27:07.440
I almost, I actually forgot until I read that.

27:07.440 --> 27:12.760
I got multiple entries in my phone as well as other, actually, both of my smartphones.

27:12.760 --> 27:14.760
And they beep and squeal all day long, so I don't forget.

27:14.760 --> 27:15.760
Yeah, you know, so, okay.

27:15.760 --> 27:16.760
Here's what we're gonna do.

27:16.760 --> 27:23.840
We're gonna start at 12 p.m. Pacific over at jblive.tv next week, on Tuesday the 17th.

27:23.840 --> 27:27.960
We won't be live on the 24th, which is Christmas Eve.

27:27.960 --> 27:29.920
So we're pre-recording.

27:29.920 --> 27:36.280
And I'll tell you, this show, having no topics and just going off the cuff is fine for one

27:36.280 --> 27:37.280
episode.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.280
Yeah.

27:38.280 --> 27:39.280
I don't know about two episodes.

27:39.280 --> 27:40.280
It might devolve into another Star Trek review.

27:40.280 --> 27:41.280
No, I'm kidding.

27:41.280 --> 27:43.040
But show up and hang out in our mumble room.

27:43.040 --> 27:45.440
You'll have more opportunities to do so.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.000
So I'll go to that.

27:47.000 --> 27:51.600
Matt, speaking of opportunity and things that you've been dealing with, I know, were you

27:51.600 --> 27:53.200
dealing with car troubles earlier today?

27:53.200 --> 27:54.200
Okay.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.200
Yeah.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.200
I mean, just keeping it real loose here.

27:56.200 --> 28:01.040
Basically, I had, I known for some time, and I'm sure Ange and Chris have certainly heard

28:01.040 --> 28:05.200
it as I'm pulling in or pulling out, my car likes to squeal like it's dying a horrible

28:05.200 --> 28:06.200
painful death.

28:06.200 --> 28:11.160
You know, I have a trusted mechanic, a very good guy here locally that I take it to top

28:11.160 --> 28:12.160
of the line fella.

28:12.160 --> 28:16.680
Well, anyway, shaving a few things off, even relying on a battery warranty, I'm looking

28:16.680 --> 28:18.720
at just under $1,000.

28:18.720 --> 28:20.520
Oh my gosh.

28:20.520 --> 28:21.520
Yeah.

28:21.520 --> 28:25.000
And it's like, I'm literally going to be delivering phone books to pay for it right

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
now.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.480
So, you know, so you got to do the balance.

28:28.480 --> 28:29.480
For the belt?

28:29.480 --> 28:30.480
For the belt?

28:30.480 --> 28:31.480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

28:31.480 --> 28:32.480
I need a new axle.

28:32.480 --> 28:33.480
What?

28:33.480 --> 28:34.480
I got all kinds of stuff.

28:34.480 --> 28:37.840
I actually went, I went to, I had a second mechanic look at it to make sure.

28:37.840 --> 28:39.200
And yeah, it's the real deal.

28:39.200 --> 28:42.520
There's a number of things that are going to be, I'm going to see what the timing belt,

28:42.520 --> 28:43.520
I think it's the other one or time.

28:43.520 --> 28:44.520
Yeah.

28:44.520 --> 28:45.520
Timing belt was the other one.

28:45.520 --> 28:46.520
There's a number of things I'm looking at.

28:46.520 --> 28:51.920
So yeah, so definitely been, you know, just one of those tough life lessons, but the good

28:51.920 --> 28:54.120
news is, is it's going to be possible.

28:54.120 --> 28:55.120
So that's what's awesome.

28:55.120 --> 29:00.320
Man, I'll tell you what, so car problems and they have a great way of coming like at the

29:00.320 --> 29:01.320
worst time ever.

29:01.320 --> 29:02.320
Well, it's December, right?

29:02.320 --> 29:04.520
I mean, clearly this is what you do.

29:04.520 --> 29:08.200
Now do you have like a business that you can like say that the vehicles for the business

29:08.200 --> 29:09.200
travel?

29:09.200 --> 29:12.960
No, at one time, yes, but not anymore because I don't, because I don't work outside of the

29:12.960 --> 29:13.960
house really.

29:13.960 --> 29:18.400
I mean, I do kind of, but not really as much as I used to, I don't just mathematically

29:18.400 --> 29:21.240
the count actually said it's easier to go this other way.

29:21.240 --> 29:24.640
Rethinking that now, but no, I really can't.

29:24.640 --> 29:27.680
So you know, it's just, it's just one of those things to where you just got to, you know,

29:27.680 --> 29:29.160
stomach it and move on.

29:29.160 --> 29:30.160
Yeah.

29:30.160 --> 29:33.760
And so, you know, I mean for us, the biggest upset has been this whole Amazon affiliate

29:33.760 --> 29:34.760
thing.

29:34.760 --> 29:35.760
Yeah.

29:35.760 --> 29:40.160
And it's been interesting because when I set up the Amazon affiliates program, I set up

29:40.160 --> 29:41.240
like four or five of them.

29:41.240 --> 29:42.240
I can't remember.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.480
I set up like, I think it was four because I was going to do an affiliate ID for each

29:44.480 --> 29:45.480
show.

29:45.480 --> 29:46.480
Yeah.

29:46.480 --> 29:49.480
And then I realized the way the Amazon system works is by traffic base.

29:49.480 --> 29:53.360
So if you have everybody use one affiliate ID, you get, you know, better results, which

29:53.360 --> 29:54.360
is totally legit.

29:54.360 --> 29:55.360
Yeah.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.760
So I had all these other accounts available.

29:56.760 --> 30:00.400
So when they shut down our account, I still had these other ones.

30:00.400 --> 30:01.800
So I thought, okay, let's see how these go.

30:01.800 --> 30:06.740
Of course, they've all, they were all systematically shut down within a period of time, including

30:06.740 --> 30:12.160
my wife's account, which is on her mom vault.com blog, completely unrelated to Jupiter broadcasting.

30:12.160 --> 30:15.400
It's just her own personal blog where she sells.

30:15.400 --> 30:18.720
If she talks about a mom product, a mommy product that she bought from Amazon, she'll

30:18.720 --> 30:21.840
put a link to it with the affiliate ID, but it's like straight up like that's all she

30:21.840 --> 30:22.840
uses it for.

30:22.840 --> 30:23.840
Yeah.

30:23.840 --> 30:25.120
It's not involved with our company at all.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.160
And they still shut even that account down.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.160
Really?

30:28.160 --> 30:31.800
Is it based on, I wonder if they're like looking at address or what the hell, I mean, or last

30:31.800 --> 30:32.800
name or I don't understand.

30:32.800 --> 30:33.800
It's gotta be address, right?

30:33.800 --> 30:34.800
Yeah.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.800
It's gotta be, right?

30:35.800 --> 30:38.320
I mean, cause you got your 10 versus SSN and all that.

30:38.320 --> 30:39.320
I don't know.

30:39.320 --> 30:44.400
I'll tell you, it comes kind of at a sucky time because so the, the early 2014 window

30:44.400 --> 30:50.820
was we were going to start up, I have a townhouse that I own that is currently rented out.

30:50.820 --> 30:56.480
And my, my idea was is I will take that townhouse and I will convert it into, I will ask the

30:56.480 --> 31:01.960
renters to vacate and then I will convert it into a studio.

31:01.960 --> 31:08.080
And part of that would also be hiring a full time person to operate the studio.

31:08.080 --> 31:12.480
And then what I would do, and this is the part that I really want to do, and I, even

31:12.480 --> 31:15.040
if we can't do the new studio, I still want to figure out a way to do this.

31:15.040 --> 31:20.360
So I'm putting the call out to the Linux unplugged audience is I want to take Tuesdays and I

31:20.360 --> 31:26.600
want to go on location to a company in the greater Seattle area that is using Linux.

31:26.600 --> 31:27.600
Ah, yeah.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.400
I mean, valve would be the dream, right?

31:29.400 --> 31:30.400
Oh yeah, right.

31:30.400 --> 31:32.040
Any company, any company.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.000
And I want, I mean, I'm asking for a lot.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.620
I mean, I realize this upfront, but what I want to do is I want to go there and here's

31:37.620 --> 31:41.800
my thought, man, just totally, it's totally economical in terms of production senses.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.600
I want to go down there on a Tuesday.

31:43.600 --> 31:47.320
I want to spend the morning shooting a segment for the Linux action show.

31:47.320 --> 31:51.120
And then I want to spend the afternoon doing a podcast from their office and maybe bring

31:51.120 --> 31:52.840
in like their sys admin, right?

31:52.840 --> 31:58.280
Bring in somebody who works with Linux onsite, have them sit down on microphone with us.

31:58.280 --> 32:01.000
And you know, you could be there in person sometimes and sometimes you'd be on Skype,

32:01.000 --> 32:02.920
whatever, whatever works for you that week.

32:02.920 --> 32:06.160
We bring it all in and we'd have somebody back at the studio who could switch it.

32:06.160 --> 32:07.160
So I'd Skype in.

32:07.160 --> 32:12.040
Maybe I'd buy myself a Galago Ultra Pro and how you utilize this nice webcam.

32:12.040 --> 32:13.040
Woo!

32:13.040 --> 32:14.040
I like that.

32:14.040 --> 32:18.400
So that's, that's my 2014 dream, so I don't know how we're going to pull that off, but

32:18.400 --> 32:23.040
if you are in the Seattle area and you would like to have us come and burden your office

32:23.040 --> 32:28.920
with our presence and abuse your bandwidth and ask you all kinds of personal probing

32:28.920 --> 32:33.240
questions about your Linux infrastructure, email me chris at jupyterbroadcasting.com

32:33.240 --> 32:35.000
because I want to start setting this stuff up.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.640
I want to start doing Linux unplugged on location and then come back with something for last

32:39.640 --> 32:43.000
on Sunday so we can, I mean, I think the opportunities here are great.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.680
Like you'll get the behind the scenes story here on unplugged.

32:45.680 --> 32:48.360
You'll get all of like the nitty gritties, the stuff that we don't tell you about on

32:48.360 --> 32:49.360
last.

32:49.360 --> 32:52.120
Just cause we'll call on last, we'll cut down and give you like, here it is, boom, boom,

32:52.120 --> 32:53.120
boom.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.120
Here's the information.

32:54.120 --> 32:55.120
Here's the interview.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.120
Here's what they're doing.

32:56.120 --> 32:57.120
But on unplugged, we're going to do it right there on location.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.120
We're going to bring their guys on.

32:58.120 --> 33:01.120
They're going to chat with us and I think this could be a great opportunity.

33:01.120 --> 33:05.400
So if you are in the greater Seattle area, Chris at jupyterbroadcasting.com, let me know

33:05.400 --> 33:08.640
and maybe we'll do an episode on site in early 2014.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.720
I don't know how, I don't know how we're going to pull that off.

33:10.720 --> 33:12.040
Oh yeah, no kidding.

33:12.040 --> 33:16.240
One way we're going to pull it off is we are rocking our, our teespring.

33:16.240 --> 33:19.040
This is, we've exceeded my, my greatest expectations.

33:19.040 --> 33:24.800
We're now at 722 of 499 that we needed to unlock it.

33:24.800 --> 33:27.000
So this, I'm just mentioning it real quick.

33:27.000 --> 33:31.380
You have five days and two hours left as of this recording to grab yourself a Jupiter

33:31.380 --> 33:36.400
broadcasting limited 2014 shirt or hoodie or ladies tee.

33:36.400 --> 33:37.400
Hello.

33:37.400 --> 33:38.680
Oh, it says women's tee.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.440
I think they should put ladies tee in there.

33:40.440 --> 33:43.360
And I think they should say it that way with a little Barry White in the background.

33:43.360 --> 33:44.360
Ladies tee.

33:44.360 --> 33:49.880
Also, I've heard from, from our, from our Aussie viewers and folks in Florida, I'm not

33:49.880 --> 33:50.880
kidding.

33:50.880 --> 33:53.640
They're happy that we have a short sleeve option as well, just a straight up tee.

33:53.640 --> 33:59.200
So if you want to get those, teespring.com slash Jupiter 2014.

33:59.200 --> 34:03.400
And if you're listening to this six days from when it was posted, it's too late.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.480
We won't have them anymore.

34:05.480 --> 34:08.520
Before we get in and we got our mumble room back and I'm going to ask the mumble room

34:08.520 --> 34:12.800
if Linux user groups are dead and Matt and I are going to share experiences with some

34:12.800 --> 34:16.320
local Linux user groups who we both love, but we're going to talk about it first.

34:16.320 --> 34:20.080
I want to thank our second sponsor this week and that is digital ocean.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.740
Digital ocean is cloud hosting made simple.

34:22.740 --> 34:25.840
They offer the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

34:25.840 --> 34:30.880
Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds and pricing plans start at only $5 per month.

34:30.880 --> 34:36.520
Which gets you 512 megabytes of RAM, 20 gigs of SSD storage, one CPU and a terabyte of

34:36.520 --> 34:40.880
transfer digital ocean has data centers in New York, San Francisco and Amsterdam.

34:40.880 --> 34:41.880
Hey oh.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.720
The interface is simple, intuitive.

34:43.720 --> 34:47.160
The control panel lets you deploy a droplet super easy.

34:47.160 --> 34:49.160
I have right now an arch server up.

34:49.160 --> 34:51.480
Yes, I said arch.

34:51.480 --> 34:56.380
It's kind of my personal experimentation and I'm going to keep pushing it, see how far

34:56.380 --> 34:57.380
I can take it.

34:57.380 --> 35:01.560
But one of the really cool things is if you want to try something out for a little bit,

35:01.560 --> 35:04.840
digital ocean also offers hourly pricing.

35:04.840 --> 35:06.480
Yes, hourly pricing.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.840
If you want to spin up a cloud server.

35:07.840 --> 35:12.360
I know and what's so awesome is you could create, so like take my arch machine that

35:12.360 --> 35:15.480
I have right now that has BitTorrent sync and other goodies on there.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.200
I have a backup snapshot of that.

35:18.200 --> 35:23.360
I can redeploy that dozens of times if I want and only pay hourly and there's something

35:23.360 --> 35:24.600
even better.

35:24.600 --> 35:29.600
Listeners of Linux Unplugged can take advantage of a special offer Linux Unplugged December.

35:29.600 --> 35:33.900
Linux Unplugged December will get you a $10 credit when you check out.

35:33.900 --> 35:35.480
Use that promo code at $10 credit.

35:35.480 --> 35:39.280
So if you're using the $5 machine like I am, well that will get you two months of that

35:39.280 --> 35:40.280
$5 machine.

35:40.280 --> 35:45.020
That's a pretty good deal and I invite you to take advantage of it because I didn't actually

35:45.020 --> 35:48.700
fully appreciate how awesome digital ocean was until I spun up a server and I've really

35:48.700 --> 35:49.880
been enjoying it.

35:49.880 --> 35:53.640
Digital ocean also has a really good community and they in fact are trying to encourage that

35:53.640 --> 35:57.220
sort of grow it a little bit and so right now they're offering those of you who want

35:57.220 --> 36:01.240
to create articles or tutorials for their community.

36:01.240 --> 36:05.480
If digital ocean selects the piece that you wrote, they'll give you a $50 credit.

36:05.480 --> 36:08.560
You can follow the link in our show notes to find out more about that but if you think

36:08.560 --> 36:13.680
about the baseline server is $5 a month, well if they give you a $50 credit, that's going

36:13.680 --> 36:17.920
to get you going for quite a while and at $5 a month, I'm thinking about taking, so

36:17.920 --> 36:21.980
right now I have an Arch server and one of the criticisms of Arch is that, oh it moves

36:21.980 --> 36:26.480
too much and that's scary because apparently we're all scared of our computers.

36:26.480 --> 36:32.040
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to also take advantage of Docker, something we talk

36:32.040 --> 36:37.640
about a lot and Matt, my thought is, is why not take Docker and spin it up on Arch and

36:37.640 --> 36:43.040
create an Ubuntu LTS or a CentOS environment in that Docker instance, install things like

36:43.040 --> 36:46.740
Zimbra or whatever sort of productivity suite I want.

36:46.740 --> 36:52.280
It lives in this cocoon of protection, this cocoon of long-term support while it rides

36:52.280 --> 36:57.800
on top of that wily and crazy ArchOS and of course DigitalOcean will let you spin up instances

36:57.800 --> 37:03.160
with Docker ready to go, also the LAMP stock totally configured CentOS, Ubuntu, they got

37:03.160 --> 37:07.280
a whole bunch on there, go check it out, go over to DigitalOcean.com, Linux Unplugged

37:07.280 --> 37:11.240
December is your promo code to get that $10 credit, that way you can check it out for

37:11.240 --> 37:16.560
a couple of months and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.720
Huge thank you, I love those guys, I love the fact that you have all that freedom and

37:19.720 --> 37:23.800
availability to actually really pick and choose the kind of lifestyle you want to lead in

37:23.800 --> 37:24.800
the cloud.

37:24.800 --> 37:28.200
And it's so nice for like software development and testing for the hourly pay as you go,

37:28.200 --> 37:29.200
that's super easy.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.560
All right, Mumble Room, are you back?

37:30.560 --> 37:31.560
Are you here?

37:31.560 --> 37:32.560
Yes, we are.

37:32.560 --> 37:37.520
All right, so let's put your flame retardant pants on and let's have a frank conversation

37:37.520 --> 37:39.600
about the state of Lugs.

37:39.600 --> 37:43.880
Popey very pointedly asked the question on the pre-show, are Lugs dying?

37:43.880 --> 37:47.560
And I think Matt and I both chimed up and said, with much respect and appreciation for

37:47.560 --> 37:52.020
both our local Everett and Bellingham Lug, which by the way, our Bellingham Lug puts

37:52.020 --> 37:54.480
on Linux Fest Northwest every year.

37:54.480 --> 37:59.640
So much respect, but sometimes it kind of feels like it's last generation that's left

37:59.640 --> 38:00.640
at these Lugs.

38:00.640 --> 38:04.320
Like, for example, in the Everett Lug, they're kind of famous for these are the guys you

38:04.320 --> 38:08.160
go to when you want to put Linux on a 486, right?

38:08.160 --> 38:10.200
It's not the kind of stuff I'm interested in anymore.

38:10.200 --> 38:13.760
I mean, I have a lot of respect for what they're trying to do and I think it's really cool.

38:13.760 --> 38:18.280
And I kind of want a 486 running Linux in my house, but at the end of the day, to get

38:18.280 --> 38:22.480
my work done, I'm looking at six core i7s, right?

38:22.480 --> 38:26.080
So I wonder to you guys, I want to start maybe Popey, are you still here?

38:26.080 --> 38:27.720
Do you want to share your thoughts on the state of Lugs?

38:27.720 --> 38:30.120
Because you're really the one that kicked this conversation off.

38:30.120 --> 38:38.040
Yeah, so this came from, I've been involved in the UK Linux user group scene for a few

38:38.040 --> 38:42.280
years and I've been to my local Linux user groups.

38:42.280 --> 38:48.120
There's three in a fairly small catchment area and when I first started going to them,

38:48.120 --> 38:53.480
it was, there were lots of talks being given.

38:53.480 --> 38:59.920
We would video the talks and we put them online and we'd get like 40 or 50 people in one

38:59.920 --> 39:07.680
county Lug coming every month, once a month, and we'd debug people's issues, we'd chat

39:07.680 --> 39:12.920
about various like salient newsworthy things that were going on.

39:12.920 --> 39:13.920
When was this?

39:13.920 --> 39:15.360
What year?

39:15.360 --> 39:21.960
This would be probably about 10 or eight years ago, somewhere around about there.

39:21.960 --> 39:25.080
And then over the years, I've kind of noticed it drop off a bit.

39:25.080 --> 39:30.120
The amount of traffic in the various mailing lists on all the Lugs in the UK has tailed

39:30.120 --> 39:31.120
off quite a lot.

39:31.120 --> 39:35.440
I mean, Popey, don't you think maybe the internet is killing the Lug a little bit because we're

39:35.440 --> 39:39.960
more connected now where we go off into our community silos and we just hyper interact

39:39.960 --> 39:40.960
there?

39:40.960 --> 39:41.960
Sure.

39:41.960 --> 39:46.400
And I know when the Linux user group nearest me first started, it was one of these ones

39:46.400 --> 39:51.760
that was a mailing list on the end of a dial up line so you might get a batch of mail every

39:51.760 --> 39:58.240
couple of days or something when the guy dialed in and processed all the requests.

39:58.240 --> 40:03.840
And now you can probably get an answer to your question before the modem has finished

40:03.840 --> 40:05.360
negotiating the call.

40:05.360 --> 40:12.240
So here's what I worry, though, is there really truly is something to that meat space connection.

40:12.240 --> 40:18.360
When I go to Linux Fest Northwest or I go to PAX and I shake the hand of a Linux action

40:18.360 --> 40:21.520
show listener or I don't know, does Brian2040 leave?

40:21.520 --> 40:22.520
No, I'm still here.

40:22.520 --> 40:23.520
Right.

40:23.520 --> 40:27.120
Like Brian2040, he was a name in the chat room until one day he's driving my truck home

40:27.120 --> 40:28.560
when I'm too sick to drive it, right?

40:28.560 --> 40:30.640
And they become real people.

40:30.640 --> 40:36.180
And that meat space connection, I think, is easy to sort of undervalue on the Internet.

40:36.180 --> 40:40.960
And I worry that lugs brought like it like now with like laptops and all this, like lugs

40:40.960 --> 40:42.860
seem like they could do more good than ever.

40:42.860 --> 40:43.860
But I agree with Popeye.

40:43.860 --> 40:45.800
It seems like they've faded big time.

40:45.800 --> 40:47.680
Yeah, and I agree with you.

40:47.680 --> 40:53.240
There is there is that element of personal interaction.

40:53.240 --> 40:58.040
And I agree with you that there are some people of an older generation in our local lug.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.440
But that works in both ways.

40:59.440 --> 41:04.200
There's a guy who's recently had to go to hospital and spent time in hospital with a

41:04.200 --> 41:08.200
netbook and found that he it was difficult for him to type.

41:08.200 --> 41:12.120
So, you know, we rallied the troops and sent a mail to the lug and I guess the keyboard

41:12.120 --> 41:13.120
they send him.

41:13.120 --> 41:14.120
Yeah, that kind of stuff.

41:14.120 --> 41:17.800
I feel like the reason why the lugs in my area are populated by the graybeards, the

41:17.800 --> 41:22.120
older guys, is because they're more socially adjusted and they're more socially balanced

41:22.120 --> 41:26.560
because they haven't been perverted by the easiness of the Internet that allows them

41:26.560 --> 41:31.160
to create these fake social connections that don't truly connect them at a human level

41:31.160 --> 41:32.160
to another person.

41:32.160 --> 41:33.640
What the actual lugs do.

41:33.640 --> 41:36.040
And I feel like we're losing something there.

41:36.040 --> 41:42.920
If I may interject, because LinuxFast Northwest was like my first really big festival I went

41:42.920 --> 41:46.680
to, at least in my experience.

41:46.680 --> 41:51.640
And you know, from what I've heard and it's just it just in and that sort of environment

41:51.640 --> 41:55.880
where it's more of a development festival almost, it feels like lugs are growing at

41:55.880 --> 41:56.880
the same time.

41:56.880 --> 42:06.320
A second ago, he's saying that lugs also were a place where you could actually get help.

42:06.320 --> 42:11.720
And when it got to the point, honestly, like it's so easy to just help yourself now.

42:11.720 --> 42:12.720
Right.

42:12.720 --> 42:13.720
The Google factor.

42:13.720 --> 42:18.240
How easy it is to take a USB stick and install it and boot you on it, like you get it done

42:18.240 --> 42:19.720
in 20 minutes by yourself.

42:19.720 --> 42:20.720
Right.

42:20.720 --> 42:23.640
Whereas before you go to a lug to have somebody walk you through the Slackware installation.

42:23.640 --> 42:24.640
Yeah, exactly.

42:24.640 --> 42:29.000
So I don't really I don't really agree with you guys.

42:29.000 --> 42:34.880
Because I'm one of the officers of the lug at UCLA, University of California, Los Angeles.

42:34.880 --> 42:41.720
And at least in my experience, we hold install fest every quarter, we give talks and stuff.

42:41.720 --> 42:47.300
And at least in the at least in our academic, like the realm of students and stuff, a lot

42:47.300 --> 42:50.160
of people just are never introduced into Linux.

42:50.160 --> 42:54.680
And then by the time they do in classes or whatever, they are introduced to such a cursory

42:54.680 --> 43:01.020
level that they need an extra place to go to to get the kind of help they need.

43:01.020 --> 43:05.000
So do you is the majority of your users group a fellow college students?

43:05.000 --> 43:06.000
Yeah.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.240
And then we also have professors and people from around the area.

43:10.240 --> 43:11.760
Okay.

43:11.760 --> 43:16.080
I think a lot of Los Angeles has scale, obviously, which I've been doing a couple times, it's

43:16.080 --> 43:17.800
just an awesome conference.

43:17.800 --> 43:21.360
But it does happen to be I mean, we have media temple and a lot of the big companies that

43:21.360 --> 43:24.960
are very focused on open source software.

43:24.960 --> 43:30.280
But it does seem that a lot of the focus is in the industry and isn't big companies.

43:30.280 --> 43:35.480
As far as the community scale, and there's a couple other lugs around LA.

43:35.480 --> 43:37.920
But we're definitely one of the biggest on the west side.

43:37.920 --> 43:39.160
And we're still not very big.

43:39.160 --> 43:41.960
But it I think it helps that we're part of university also.

43:41.960 --> 43:45.080
So do you guys meet on a regular basis?

43:45.080 --> 43:47.920
Yeah, so we have meetings every week.

43:47.920 --> 43:48.920
Okay.

43:48.920 --> 43:51.640
And how was the attendance like on those?

43:51.640 --> 43:57.560
So we probably have seven or eight extremely active people who come to every meeting.

43:57.560 --> 44:02.040
We have a lot of legacy users and one of the a lot of legacy members.

44:02.040 --> 44:07.560
And we have a lot of people hang on to RSC, or I'll come to install fast and stuff.

44:07.560 --> 44:09.160
But in terms of active is maybe 10 people.

44:09.160 --> 44:14.400
So it's still not very many that come to every single meeting or whatever.

44:14.400 --> 44:15.400
Go ahead.

44:15.400 --> 44:21.160
I mean, I was gonna say, for the longest time, I actually hung out in the IRC of a Linux

44:21.160 --> 44:25.240
user group that started out actually as an Ubuntu Loco.

44:25.240 --> 44:29.200
They were Ubuntu Loco Kentucky, and then they went to Bluegrass Linux user group.

44:29.200 --> 44:31.240
It was active for a while.

44:31.240 --> 44:35.820
I went to a few meetings in 2011.

44:35.820 --> 44:37.160
But it's really tapered off.

44:37.160 --> 44:42.240
A lot of the major members moved down to Texas, I think.

44:42.240 --> 44:45.080
And then I myself ended up moving out to Kansas.

44:45.080 --> 44:48.920
Yeah, see, I found it moved the other way where I am.

44:48.920 --> 44:56.100
There was a distinct move from geographically centered Linux user groups, like in the UK,

44:56.100 --> 44:59.360
you have one per county, and I'm sure you have one per state or one per city in the

44:59.360 --> 45:01.120
US.

45:01.120 --> 45:04.880
It moved to a UK wide Ubuntu Loco.

45:04.880 --> 45:05.880
Like I moved that way.

45:05.880 --> 45:07.980
And a lot of people move that way, too.

45:07.980 --> 45:15.400
And then there were various other distro specific groups as well, which kind of made the Locos,

45:15.400 --> 45:20.000
the Lugs somewhat less populated and less utilized.

45:20.000 --> 45:25.800
Geographically, I have to say, that's probably a lot easier to do in the UK than it would

45:25.800 --> 45:29.120
be in the United States.

45:29.120 --> 45:35.640
In my area, the user group in my area is very scarce.

45:35.640 --> 45:42.920
So there was one Lug that was here for a couple of years, and it's been just disbanded, but

45:42.920 --> 45:45.760
it's been replaced by a meetup group for just Linux users.

45:45.760 --> 45:51.640
Yeah, that's the thing that hindered me from going to a lot of meetings is I was in Louisville,

45:51.640 --> 45:56.720
Kentucky, and I was younger at the time, and most of the meetings were over in Lexington,

45:56.720 --> 45:59.360
Kentucky, so a majority of the time, I couldn't make it.

45:59.360 --> 46:05.480
Yeah, see, I'm in North Georgia, and of course, as a person that uses Linux that I know personally,

46:05.480 --> 46:09.880
I mean, I don't know him, but Brian, he was probably like an hour from me, just to kind

46:09.880 --> 46:14.600
of give you an example, it's just spread out all over the place.

46:14.600 --> 46:19.120
Is there some value in a Linux user's group that exists virtually, like this Mumble Room

46:19.120 --> 46:22.720
right now is as big as some Lug attendees are, right?

46:22.720 --> 46:25.800
And the IRC is many times larger.

46:25.800 --> 46:31.000
Right now, 367 people in the IRC right now are chatting about Linux related topics, way

46:31.000 --> 46:32.960
bigger than a local Lug.

46:32.960 --> 46:40.320
So is the amount of connectivity and the frequency of connectivity and the availability of information

46:40.320 --> 46:46.400
and help, does that in some ways, I guess if the end goal is Linux adoption, if the

46:46.400 --> 46:51.080
end goal is getting people using Linux, doesn't this new model where the Lug plays less of

46:51.080 --> 46:55.440
a role still promote Linux on the desktop more?

46:55.440 --> 46:56.440
I completely agree.

46:56.440 --> 46:57.440
I remember that.

46:57.440 --> 47:04.320
And the reason being is that in my area, there aren't very many even computer user groups,

47:04.320 --> 47:12.720
let alone Linux user groups, or even, I was looking for an Ubuntu Loco for some time ago.

47:12.720 --> 47:20.840
The closest one is over the Seattle area, and then there's another one that's in Boise,

47:20.840 --> 47:21.840
Idaho.

47:21.840 --> 47:22.840
That's the next closest.

47:22.840 --> 47:23.840
Right.

47:23.840 --> 47:24.840
That's just how it is here too.

47:24.840 --> 47:28.160
There's like nothing computer-related groups like that.

47:28.160 --> 47:32.600
Yeah, that's a big factor, especially in the US, is there's massive groups of areas that

47:32.600 --> 47:36.360
don't have other technology enthusiast groups.

47:36.360 --> 47:41.480
But at the same time, going back to the IRC thing, IRC has been around since like a dawn

47:41.480 --> 47:42.480
of time.

47:42.480 --> 47:49.240
So here in Kansas, the closest Linux user group to me is the Kansas City, Missouri one,

47:49.240 --> 47:53.080
although that doesn't seem all that active.

47:53.080 --> 47:54.820
It's more than that, I see.

47:54.820 --> 48:02.080
It's like for me, I live in a huge city center, I live in Toronto, and I can't get to their

48:02.080 --> 48:07.840
local user group because it's so packed and I'm on such a small time straight.

48:07.840 --> 48:08.840
Interesting.

48:08.840 --> 48:16.920
I also think that the idea that an online friendship, an online relationship is a lot

48:16.920 --> 48:20.680
considered a lot more legitimate these days than it was 10 years ago.

48:20.680 --> 48:21.680
True.

48:21.680 --> 48:29.480
I remember some five, six years ago when Lug Radio, John O'Bacon, Stuart Langridge podcast

48:29.480 --> 48:30.480
was going.

48:30.480 --> 48:31.480
Right.

48:31.480 --> 48:36.760
There's a guy in France, there's an IRC channel and it's still going now, hash lug radio on

48:36.760 --> 48:39.760
free node, long after the podcast finished.

48:39.760 --> 48:45.240
Podcast finished six years ago and the IRC channel is still there and people still come

48:45.240 --> 48:49.040
in there and say, good morning, morning everyone, there's still a community around it.

48:49.040 --> 48:58.680
And I remember Bruno, a guy from France who listened to the podcast and was always in

48:58.680 --> 49:03.160
the IRC channel said, lug radio is my lug.

49:03.160 --> 49:09.200
And this was five, six years ago, he saw this online virtual community as his Linux user

49:09.200 --> 49:13.920
group, as the people he was empathic with that he could relate to.

49:13.920 --> 49:17.320
This could be the Irish schnapps talking, but you guys literally are my lug.

49:17.320 --> 49:19.600
Oh, I love you too.

49:19.600 --> 49:20.600
I mean, same here.

49:20.600 --> 49:24.560
You know, Chris, when you mentioned something earlier about, you know, when you met Brian

49:24.560 --> 49:29.760
at the Linux Fest Northwest, you know, that kind of reminded me how earlier this year

49:29.760 --> 49:36.600
I also helped Brian pack his stuff when he was moving from Southern Indiana down to Georgia.

49:36.600 --> 49:37.600
Right.

49:37.600 --> 49:41.280
Well, that is really the interesting thing is there are members in like our IRC chat

49:41.280 --> 49:43.360
room that have been met up in real life.

49:43.360 --> 49:45.240
Like Brian, didn't you meet up with Mail Hauler?

49:45.240 --> 49:46.240
Twice, actually.

49:46.240 --> 49:54.560
Met up with Tyler, Mail Hauler and his entire family and you, Angela, and Ty the Geek over

49:54.560 --> 49:55.560
at Linux Fest.

49:55.560 --> 49:56.560
So yeah, lots of people.

49:56.560 --> 50:02.600
I mean, it is hard out going home for Brian too from Atlanta.

50:02.600 --> 50:07.200
I actually plan on certain early this year saving up to get a plane ticket to head out

50:07.200 --> 50:09.320
towards Linux Fest Northwest in April.

50:09.320 --> 50:10.320
Oh, man.

50:10.320 --> 50:11.320
Awesome.

50:11.320 --> 50:13.880
See, this makes me want to get the studio started up because then we could have like

50:13.880 --> 50:17.160
a spot for everybody to come hang out after Linux Fest Northwest.

50:17.160 --> 50:18.160
That would be cool.

50:18.160 --> 50:19.160
Yeah, I would love to go up there too.

50:19.160 --> 50:20.160
Yeah, that would be a lot of fun.

50:20.160 --> 50:26.000
What's happened to Lugs is that all the simple support stuff has gone online and now it's

50:26.000 --> 50:33.480
just the dedicated users that go to these hyper-focused events like hackerspaces or

50:33.480 --> 50:35.080
in their towns or these conventions.

50:35.080 --> 50:39.760
See, hackerspaces are different though because hackers are like more like computer centric

50:39.760 --> 50:40.760
focused.

50:40.760 --> 50:51.520
So there's a big overlap there though, if I go to any of my hackspaces nearby, they're

50:51.520 --> 50:56.280
the same kind of people like, you know, people who want to take things apart and make them

50:56.280 --> 51:01.280
work the way they want to don't necessarily want to use devices the way that the manufacturer

51:01.280 --> 51:02.280
intended.

51:02.280 --> 51:05.280
They're the same kind of ethic that we have.

51:05.280 --> 51:06.720
Yeah, it is.

51:06.720 --> 51:10.720
So I totally agree with Popeye because at least in LA, we have DevOps LA meetups and

51:10.720 --> 51:16.720
different infrastructure like industry type user groups and in many ways, I think those

51:16.720 --> 51:24.160
have replaced the Lug movement because as more and more people want Linux professionals,

51:24.160 --> 51:28.320
they kind of congregate within their own professional groups rather than these informal Lug type

51:28.320 --> 51:29.320
situations.

51:29.320 --> 51:35.400
Well, and it's interesting too as new Linux based technologies take off like Android online,

51:35.400 --> 51:39.720
the communities solely seem to be forming online, right?

51:39.720 --> 51:42.040
And very large ones like the XDA form.

51:42.040 --> 51:45.480
Oh, Bruce Phoenix actually just had an awesome idea.

51:45.480 --> 51:49.960
What if you got your new studio and turn it into a Jupiter broadcasting hackerspace?

51:49.960 --> 51:51.360
Oh, that would be cool.

51:51.360 --> 51:54.920
You know, we would have a garage so there is possibilities.

51:54.920 --> 52:02.680
And you know, if you made that new studio, you could have a couple interns too.

52:02.680 --> 52:07.400
All right, well, interesting thoughts.

52:07.400 --> 52:11.400
You know, I'd love to hear also if anyone out in the download audience has experience

52:11.400 --> 52:15.980
with a local Linux users group or runs one or is involved with one.

52:15.980 --> 52:16.980
We'd love to hear what you think.

52:16.980 --> 52:20.500
Go over to Jupiterbroadcasting.com and pop that contact link at the top of the site.

52:20.500 --> 52:24.000
There is actually a Linux unplugged drop down there.

52:24.000 --> 52:28.440
Any other closing thoughts you guys like on the Lug topic?

52:28.440 --> 52:33.320
I have all I got to say is coming April, party at the J.B. studio.

52:33.320 --> 52:34.320
Yeah, I agree.

52:34.320 --> 52:35.320
All right, Matt.

52:35.320 --> 52:41.960
Well, also, when it comes to things, well, I was going for most of this topic.

52:41.960 --> 52:47.160
Well for me, all those groups, all those groups, they're more of the follow up from the old

52:47.160 --> 52:54.320
school computer clubs that used to do the old hardware stuff and the old OS stuff.

52:54.320 --> 52:56.760
I wouldn't discount them because of that, though.

52:56.760 --> 52:58.960
Well, they never had the Internet back at that time.

52:58.960 --> 52:59.960
No, I agree.

52:59.960 --> 53:00.960
It was just being like invented.

53:00.960 --> 53:05.600
But there is something about seeing somebody else do something in Linux that makes you

53:05.600 --> 53:09.640
go, oh, I could do that when you see it happen.

53:09.640 --> 53:10.640
I'll tell you this.

53:10.640 --> 53:15.160
The reason I say this is because for years I went to clients and a few of these clients

53:15.160 --> 53:20.540
I would have like the tech savvy guy or gal that worked there who was like the tech person

53:20.540 --> 53:21.740
for the company.

53:21.740 --> 53:27.200
And when she would see Compiz on my Linux machine, that was the coolest thing ever.

53:27.200 --> 53:29.920
And that made her or him want to run Linux.

53:29.920 --> 53:36.920
If I can say something, honestly, that kind of concept is what actually, because I'd say

53:36.920 --> 53:41.200
my first experience with that was actually watching the Linux action show.

53:41.200 --> 53:43.400
That's kind of how I got into it in the first place.

53:43.400 --> 53:45.800
And now you're spinning out your own distro.

53:45.800 --> 53:46.800
Yes.

53:46.800 --> 53:48.800
Yeah, that's interesting.

53:48.800 --> 53:52.320
So I think for myself, what really killed the whole Lug situation really comes down

53:52.320 --> 53:53.320
to the following.

53:53.320 --> 53:58.600
I poked in and out of the Bellingham Lug for a few years, just real occasional.

53:58.600 --> 54:05.680
And I found it remarkable how it felt like Groundhog Day, no new faces, always the same

54:05.680 --> 54:07.400
folks, great folks, awesome people.

54:07.400 --> 54:11.320
But it was just the same thing over and over.

54:11.320 --> 54:14.720
And honestly, it's like even online, it's hard to get that stale.

54:14.720 --> 54:19.320
So for me, I stopped attending just because I was really not getting anything new from

54:19.320 --> 54:20.320
it.

54:20.320 --> 54:22.880
Everybody used OpenSUSE, and if you didn't, you weren't, or not OpenSUSE, but a SUSE

54:22.880 --> 54:23.880
at the time.

54:23.880 --> 54:26.880
It was very much an echo changer.

54:26.880 --> 54:31.520
Yeah, I could see the echo chamber in the same old stories over and over again.

54:31.520 --> 54:35.260
So that sounds like a Lug that's kind of given up on recruiting.

54:35.260 --> 54:37.320
And they're kind of in a rut.

54:37.320 --> 54:41.480
Because we've had an experience where this year we did a pretty heavy recruiting drive

54:41.480 --> 54:46.680
with all the club fairs and stuff at our school.

54:46.680 --> 54:51.440
It's basically just about you need to, because we're in a room in the bottom of the engineering

54:51.440 --> 54:55.960
building and unless you know about us, unless you have discovery, no one's going to know

54:55.960 --> 54:56.960
we're here.

54:56.960 --> 55:03.400
I would say from what you're saying is that the Lug is most likely to live on the best

55:03.400 --> 55:04.400
in a college campus.

55:04.400 --> 55:05.400
Yeah, I would agree with that.

55:05.400 --> 55:13.560
And the thing is, is the college campus doesn't really, as much as, I totally dig that Cognizant

55:13.560 --> 55:17.040
was talking about a Lug and that's awesome, but to me it seems like it's only successful

55:17.040 --> 55:18.960
because you kind of have a captive audience.

55:18.960 --> 55:23.160
It's easy to message to them because they're all in one location and they're sort of already

55:23.160 --> 55:24.160
there.

55:24.160 --> 55:25.160
And you got people churned.

55:25.160 --> 55:26.160
You got new faces at least.

55:26.160 --> 55:27.160
Right.

55:27.160 --> 55:28.160
Oh, great point.

55:28.160 --> 55:30.840
Isn't that what a business would want if they want to hire people who know Linux?

55:30.840 --> 55:35.680
And they want to team up with somebody who's attracting other young, fresh blood who are

55:35.680 --> 55:36.680
coming through the colleges?

55:36.680 --> 55:37.680
It's funny you mention that.

55:37.680 --> 55:44.520
It's funny you mention that because that's one of the primary reasons we exist.

55:44.520 --> 55:51.040
Our school is a typical high level CS department where they really don't teach a lot of practical

55:51.040 --> 55:52.040
skills.

55:52.040 --> 55:57.400
Because in CS and academic levels, almost like math, it's like math for computer programs.

55:57.400 --> 56:03.920
And to teach, like for example, I've been doing a lot of work professionally with Puppet

56:03.920 --> 56:09.720
and very different DevOps, vagrant stuff, type CS integration stuff.

56:09.720 --> 56:13.080
And those are skills that I basically taught myself.

56:13.080 --> 56:18.080
And I've gotten jobs because I've known these skills from teaching myself.

56:18.080 --> 56:22.640
And when there's an interest group where we give talks about these things and we have

56:22.640 --> 56:26.240
other people who are interested in them, like I've had, I'm not going to name names, I think

56:26.240 --> 56:31.040
it's probably not the best thing, but we've had very massive companies come and trying

56:31.040 --> 56:35.240
to partner directly with us and give sponsor talks and things to try and attract our members.

56:35.240 --> 56:36.340
So they're looking for talent.

56:36.340 --> 56:37.560
They're looking for hires?

56:37.560 --> 56:38.560
Yeah.

56:38.560 --> 56:43.800
So like I've gotten three jobs from, I don't know, I don't know if it's directly from the

56:43.800 --> 56:51.200
Lug, but it's from just knowing these things and having that kind of interest.

56:51.200 --> 56:52.520
That actually makes a lot of sense, right?

56:52.520 --> 56:55.920
Because these companies don't know quite how to find these people.

56:55.920 --> 56:59.840
And a Lug is something they can see, something they understand, something they can approach

56:59.840 --> 57:03.440
and they can come to the Lug and say, we're looking for somebody who is talented NGINX

57:03.440 --> 57:06.160
and et cetera, et cetera, right?

57:06.160 --> 57:10.680
So this is something that is actually, I was talking to the Facebook recruiter and she

57:10.680 --> 57:15.480
was telling me, okay, so Facebook has this position called production engineer.

57:15.480 --> 57:20.720
And the reason this position exists is because the software engineers they hire don't know

57:20.720 --> 57:27.160
enough about the infrastructure backbone to make the kind of decisions they have to make

57:27.160 --> 57:30.000
about how will this application run in production.

57:30.000 --> 57:33.760
And so a lot of what happens is a software engineer will end up learning a lot of these

57:33.760 --> 57:38.200
skills after they've been on the job for a while and then transition to this role.

57:38.200 --> 57:44.280
Well, another thing is if you remember at Linux Fest Northwest, Chris, that lots of

57:44.280 --> 57:48.480
job recruiting people are also there like Dice.com was there.

57:48.480 --> 57:49.480
Yeah.

57:49.480 --> 57:50.480
Yeah, it's true.

57:50.480 --> 57:52.360
That's a great point.

57:52.360 --> 57:56.240
And I think part of that is because some of these companies have their foot in the old

57:56.240 --> 58:00.080
world and they really haven't figured out how to approach a community.

58:00.080 --> 58:03.920
Like if you think about it, like if you were trying to hire a sys admin or you're trying

58:03.920 --> 58:08.160
to hire somebody to take care of your backend infrastructure, dude, I would totally troll

58:08.160 --> 58:11.320
the Linux action show subreddit, but these companies haven't figured it out, right?

58:11.320 --> 58:16.480
They haven't figured it out, but what they have figured out is Lugs and user conferences.

58:16.480 --> 58:17.480
That's a great point.

58:17.480 --> 58:19.520
I didn't even think about.

58:19.520 --> 58:23.640
And now that I think about it, if I was going to hire somebody for like to handle the Jupiter

58:23.640 --> 58:27.200
broadcasting backend, that's probably where I would look to actually.

58:27.200 --> 58:28.840
Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.

58:28.840 --> 58:29.920
Yeah, it does make a lot of sense.

58:29.920 --> 58:32.100
I never even thought about the employment aspect.

58:32.100 --> 58:37.520
And so, I mean, that's probably another argument for like, how do we figure out how to rejuvenate

58:37.520 --> 58:40.160
the Lug and does it need to be rebooted?

58:40.160 --> 58:41.160
Okay.

58:41.160 --> 58:42.160
Let me ask.

58:42.160 --> 58:43.160
Okay.

58:43.160 --> 58:44.160
Mumbo room.

58:44.160 --> 58:45.160
Let me ask you this and Popey, I want to start with you because you're the one that brought

58:45.160 --> 58:46.160
up the topic.

58:46.160 --> 58:48.200
So I think you should get first shot at this.

58:48.200 --> 58:50.960
Would a Google Hangout replace a Lug?

58:50.960 --> 59:01.240
No, because the people that you want to get involved are highly opinionated and the kind

59:01.240 --> 59:04.480
of people who wouldn't touch Google Hangouts with a barge pole.

59:04.480 --> 59:05.480
Well, okay.

59:05.480 --> 59:07.360
I'll give you that on the last part.

59:07.360 --> 59:11.040
But let's look at the Ubuntu Developer Summits.

59:11.040 --> 59:15.200
You guys have moved to these virtual summits and you're still getting a lot of stuff done.

59:15.200 --> 59:16.880
There's a lot of discussions that are happening.

59:16.880 --> 59:20.400
People are able to attend because they're able to just connect in.

59:20.400 --> 59:22.360
You're seeing each other face to face.

59:22.360 --> 59:25.500
I mean, there's productivity happening there.

59:25.500 --> 59:27.400
Isn't it better than nothing?

59:27.400 --> 59:35.700
Yeah, but UDS is a very different animal than Lugs.

59:35.700 --> 59:43.000
And we all have Google accounts by virtue of the fact that we have a Google set up.

59:43.000 --> 59:44.480
Oh, that's a good point.

59:44.480 --> 59:46.560
Not everybody has a Google account.

59:46.560 --> 59:52.800
But Lugs are the place where you find people who buy Android phones and then immediately

59:52.800 --> 59:58.640
flash them so they don't ever have to connect to Google or the kinds of people who refuse

59:58.640 --> 59:59.640
to have smartphones.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:04.000
I'm not saying there's anything bad about that, but it's a different type of person

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
in a Lug.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
All right.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Isn't that the problem?

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.960
Don't we need to reboot the Lug and make it more modernized that way guys like me who

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:15.060
want as I want a 12 core processor, maybe I want two of them in my box, I want 64 gigs

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:16.060
of RAM.

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:17.400
Why don't we reboot the Lug for that guy?

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:21.400
So you're saying that's exactly what to turn it into.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:25.680
Having it turn into a hack fest type thing would be more similar to the old school's

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.680
Lug.

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:32.240
At the same time though, that's like Linux was for those people who wanted not to use

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.240
them.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:37.000
Like it's for open and free software and not like hangouts.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.080
Also, when you're in some person, all the creative juices happen a little bit better

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:45.880
and you're more competitive when you're in person versus just the internet.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:46.880
That's interesting.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:55.560
It makes you think better and harder about what the hell to counteract this guy's idea.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:03.680
A few years ago on OMG Ubuntu, which is a popular blog you may have heard of, Benjamin

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:11.040
Humphrey who used to write for them wrote a post about neck beards and he got a massive

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:17.700
negative feedback from the community because he was basically having a pop at people in

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:25.100
the way that you're suggesting that we should move on and maybe we should involve younger

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:32.600
blood who want faster processors and the JavaScript and that kind of thing of today rather than

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.720
COBOL and mainframes and 26s.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.920
You are blaming me for stereotyping when you are saying that all these people at Lugs are

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:47.400
old school mainframe COBOL guys and I'm saying that stereotyping of Lug, you are really sir.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.400
Really sir.

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:52.400
What I'm saying is that he made that kind of suggestion and he got a lot of flack for

01:01:52.400 --> 01:02:01.420
it and rightly so because what the reaction was actually that people, what you're doing

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:08.160
now and in the future is built on the shoulders of what the people did before you.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:13.240
If those Lugs didn't exist three years ago, ten years ago, then your podcast wouldn't

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:14.240
exist.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.240
Yeah, isn't that true?

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.240
Do you see what I mean?

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.240
Yeah, I do.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.240
What's come out of this to me is that you need...

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:22.000
This podcast is almost like the recording of a huge Lug meeting.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.480
I'd say a community though has to center itself around far more than just a Google Plus hangout.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.520
There needs to be more substance to it.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:36.080
But you've also got to have, you've got to close the loop locally like what's happening

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.720
at Cogsues College, so you need two separate things.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:44.040
The online stuff is going to solve itself and happen and is happening right now, but

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.120
you need to close the loop locally.

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:50.560
I think you might be onto something there because going back to the Linux Fest Northwest,

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:56.520
it's like it is truly one thing to know these people and hear their voices, but to actually

01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:02.000
shake their hand, see them as a human with their flaws and with their pluses that you

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.120
never knew about until you saw them personally.

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:10.800
Like I really, really love my truck, okay?

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:19.360
I really love my truck, and I gave the keys to my truck to Brian2040, and I think that

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.980
no other man, maybe with the exception of one or two other men, have ever driven my

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:25.000
truck and will never drive my truck.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.280
I will make that point right now, will never drive my truck, but I gave it to Brian2040.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.760
Part of it was because I knew him in the IRC, but then I met him and there's a connection

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.400
that is made.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.400
And it's interesting, I think-

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.400
Get a room.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:43.680
I remember Chris standing out there with a food box in his bathroom, but you also had

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.440
to point out you were violently ill as well, so-

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.440
I was quite sick.

01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.440
My options were limited.

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.440
That is true.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:51.760
I remember very clearly as Chris looks me dead in the eyes, deadpan serious, and says,

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.760
dude, I don't feel good.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:53.760
And I was like, oh, okay.

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:59.480
I was like, no, Matt, really, I don't know what's going to happen, and I'm just like,

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.480
oh, crap.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.640
Yeah, we were actually all concerned because Chris went out into his car and then it was

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.640
just nothing for like two hours.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.640
Yeah.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:09.640
It was funny.

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:10.640
He died.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:11.640
I kept thinking like, I'll get better.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:12.640
I'll get better.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.640
I'll be all right.

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.640
I'll be okay.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:18.200
But I will tell you that it wasn't for Angela coming in and basically looping all of us

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:20.920
together, because we're a bunch of trained monkeys going in circles.

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.060
She was the one that set us straight and made sure we got things done.

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:26.800
So I got to give props to her on that one, big time.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.800
Big time.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.800
I'll be all right.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.800
It's just a flesh wound.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.800
Yeah.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:31.800
Yeah, exactly.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.800
Exactly.

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:33.800
Oh, yeah.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:34.800
No, he was so...

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.800
I felt so bad.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.160
I totally see the closing the loop argument.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.900
But unfortunately, that's not a practical...

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:46.100
So people listening to us in the UK, they can't realistically attend Linux Fest Northwest

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.120
and shake our hands.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.480
So I want to offer something to them.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:53.040
I want to say to them that even though you're not visiting the Lug, you're still part of

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.960
an overall larger community.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.960
Yeah.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:56.960
Hugs for Lugs.

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.960
Hugs for Lugs.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:04.880
What you need is you need to start a fundraiser so you could take a trip with the family over

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:07.760
to the United Kingdom to have a meetup there.

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:11.880
Once I get the staying on the air thing figured out and the studio thing figured out and the

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:16.240
doing Linux action shows and Linux unplugged on location thing figured out, then it's the

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.640
travel to the UK thing I got to figure out.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:23.200
So Chris, let me know when you're coming over to the UK so I can go to another country.

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:24.200
Ouch.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.080
The poppy that hurts on the inside, deep down.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.080
Wow.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.080
We're Americans.

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:33.640
We like our little angry bubble.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.480
All right.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.480
We love our ignorance.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:38.480
Okay.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.480
Now, this is...

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.480
This is the...

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.480
Oh, boy.

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:42.480
These are the final thoughts.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:45.960
You know, the Linux action show went down to the Ubuntu one conference back when they

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.360
did these things in the meet space and that was a good time.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.860
That was actually a really good time.

01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:51.860
So all right.

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:52.960
Any final thoughts, you guys on the Lug?

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.680
I know Ixl, you were thinking about...

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:58.520
Ixl, what you think about starting the Lug on your own?

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:05.240
I thought about it and kind of played around with the idea, but with me moving, there's

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.880
no real sense in doing it over here.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:10.720
So I mean, if there's anybody else like in the chat room, I saw somebody else from the

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:11.720
Spokane area.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.720
Oh, he just found spokane-linux.org.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:14.720
How about that?

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.280
That's actually pretty cool.

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.280
All right.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:22.840
Well, it's an interesting topic and it's one that I'd love to hear the audience sort of

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:23.840
at large.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:29.080
Like, I wonder if maybe because we're living on the West Coast, we're right by...

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:33.720
I mean, I think I could get to Microsoft in 45 minutes if traffic was good.

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:35.560
You could throw rocks at them from the house.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:39.640
So maybe they're interfering with my thought process just because of the proximity.

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:44.000
So if you are living out there and you have a rocking Lug, we'd love to hear about it.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.360
And I know they're out there, like our Bellingham Lug puts on Linux Fest Northwest every single

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:50.120
year and those guys are awesome.

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:53.800
The Everett Lug is nearby and they're working out on some pretty cool stuff, but I'd love

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.800
to hear what you guys are doing.

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:59.800
So go over to jupitabroadcasting.com and pop that contact link and let us know what's happening

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:00.800
in your neck of the woods.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.600
And don't forget, we're doing a double back, back-to-back special of Linux Unplugged next

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.600
week.

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:07.600
So join us for that.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:08.800
We'd love to get you in the mumble room.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:13.280
That'll be on the 17th starting at 12 p.m. Pacific over at jblive.tv.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.400
Don't know what time that is in your local area?

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.400
That's okay.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.400
It's okay.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:22.840
We've got a jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar and it uses secret technology that automatically

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.680
converts it to your local time zone.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.160
I don't even know how that's possible.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.160
It's some sort of...

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.160
Munchkins and gremlins.

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.560
It's some sort of, yeah, exactly, right?

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:34.760
I think we've had munchkins and gremlins that have been working on our website named Hymer

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.320
16 and they are incredible.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:40.720
All right, Matt, well coming up on Sunday, we'll have a look at the Leopard Extreme.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:44.080
I'm punishing it right now as we speak.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:49.640
So and I know we've got more to talk about too so I want everybody to go over to jupitabroadcasting.com

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.960
and go watch our last episode of Linux Action Show if you didn't catch that and then tune

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:53.960
in next week.

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:58.180
We've got a big one where I'm taking the Leopard Extreme, the real System76 Mac Pro competitor

01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.840
and we'll see how it holds up to a production workload.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:01.840
Definitely.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:02.840
All right, Matt.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:03.840
Well, I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:04.840
See you on Sunday.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.840
Okay, everyone.

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:08.600
Thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.400
We'll see you on Sunday for the big show and we'll see you right back here on Tuesday

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:12.960
for the next episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:13.960
Thanks so much.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:14.960
Take care.

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:43.960
Bye-bye.
