1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I think you should see this.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's just a kid.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is a G chord.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
He's learning. Absorbent. He's getting smarter every day.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Homo Habilis was the first to use tools.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A player who makes a team great is more valuable than a great player.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Losing yourself in the group for the good of the group. That's teamwork.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's happening fast.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We've always watched the stars. If you look at the sky, you can see the beginning of time.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Collecting data is only the first step toward wisdom.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But sharing data is the first step toward community.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Poetry. There's not much glory in poetry. Only achievement.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Knowledge amplification. What he learns, we all learn.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What he knows, we all benefit from.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
One little thing can solve an incredibly complex problem.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Everything's about timing, kid.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This is business. Faster, better, cheaper.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Constant improvement.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So, you want to fly, huh?

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Wingspeed, thrust.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's physics.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Republica non dominitur.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Plummet. It's all about the tools.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Speaking of that, go back down.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Go back down.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Does he have a name?

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
His name is Lennox.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Welcome to Lennox Unplugged, episode 309.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
My name is Chris. My name is Wes.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's a big day today, Wes. Huge!

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, we'll get into some of that in the news.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Plus, Mozilla has been labeled a villain.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Villainy!

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
For supporting DNS over HTTPS.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We're going to talk about DNS today in a way that I hope is approachable to everyone.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And talk about some ways you can implement some of these own solutions that can be very advantageous, have a lot of benefits.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And we'll tell you also what the possible downsides are and what has everybody so upset.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Plus, we have some feedback, some great pics.

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But before we get to any of that, we've got to say hello to everybody who's joining us today.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hello to Cheese, Alex, Andrew. Guys, good to have you here.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hey, how's it going?

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hello. We have a panel of experts today, really.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But as always, we're like staffed by what I would consider to be a council of internet experts.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hello.

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You know, on the pre-show, we were talking about how great it is that we have like a multi-year lug going now here.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And we meet every single week. It's so cool.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And then when you join our lug, you get to be part of the conversation in a show that is...

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
All you have to do is show up and you're a co-host with us right here on air.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
There's a few people that listen to the show and you can be part of that.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And there's also our chat room that goes along while we do the show at irc.geekshed.net pound jupiter broadcasting.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And all of our live times over at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I bring all of that up to point out that we won't be here live next week.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We will have an episode.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm super excited though, Wes, because last night I made the plunge to switch to Evolution.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, this is, you know...

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Did you see this one coming?

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, because it's been months and I thought you would kind of quietly forsaken desktop email on Linux.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, for sure.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You just moved to mobile devices and that's fine. I'm a web email guy myself.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Evolution? Tell me about it.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I've been quietly struggling with MailSpring.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's a decent, it's an electron-based mail application that ties in pretty good with Google Apps, which is...

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Now I've got like a couple of Google Apps accounts.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh, so many, yeah.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And that's been nice, but the other day I opened it up and it lost its entire config.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The JSON files just totally messed up.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You do not have a high tolerance for events like that, I would say.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And you have a few emails.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yeah, so I messaged Wimpy and I'm like, okay, you and I...

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He understands my email plight, like he knows my struggle.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm like, Wimpy, I know you're using MailSpring, this just happened to me, this line no farther.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The line must be drawn here.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What are your email secrets?

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And he says, you know what I'm doing?

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He says, a bit ago, I switched to Evolution.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And I like it so much that we're moving Ubuntu Mate that direction off of Thunderbird to Evolution.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And I'm like, Evolution?

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I used that like...

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Ages ago.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Maybe seven, eight, nine years ago.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I mean, it's been a really long time.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It was during the era of Exchange 5.5, maybe the next revision up.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I just hadn't gone back.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And I'll tell you, Wes, I installed it via Flatpak.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Of course.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And the setup to connect to Google Apps accounts felt very old school.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I had to put smtp.gmail.com and stuff.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Full details, no fancy little graphical icon.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, you've got a Google account? Let me fill everything out for you like everything else does now.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
None of that. But it does, once you set all that up, it's like, oh, this is a Google account.

93
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, let me import your calendars for you.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And it actually does that really, really well.

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Once you just Google search, hey, what are your mail search, you know, IMAP and SMTP stuff,

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
underneath all of it, Evolution knows it's talking to Google.

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
See, that's smart. And calendar is probably the next most important thing, right?

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes. I am very happy with the results.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I plugged three of my large...

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Just as an example, today, my Jupiter Broadcasting email account has 14,000 unread emails in it.

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I was going to say, yeah, you should explain.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You're working at a little bit of scale here.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And I re-email every single day. I try to keep on top of it.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And it's just like, and Evolution just handled it like I had to download and stuff, like I had to give it time.

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's handling it like a champ.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How do you feel about the interface these days?

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Not bad. You know, I had to fix it. I had to fix it.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What I discovered is Flatpaks won't use your system theme unless you install...

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
On FlatHub, there's like all the fairly well-known GNOME themes.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
So do you have to go install it so you can kind of connect to that ecosystem?

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Exactly. So I installed a Flatpak for ArcDark.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh, well, there you go.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
And now all my GTK Flatpak apps, once I launched them again, all got ArcDark.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So it worked out.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Now I love the interface because it's flat, it's modern, it's working, it's fast.

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It feels fast compared...

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So Evolution used to feel slow to me.

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Evolution used to be what I considered to be a slow application.

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
But my...

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That baseline has changed with Electron, my friend.

121
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
When you have a mail application that has 70,000 emails in it or something like that, it really chugs.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And you need, in my opinion, you just need a native application.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Wow. Yeah, you're excited about a native desktop Linux application.

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I love it. No, it's great. Honestly, I'm installing it from FlatHub right now.

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Because why not? Especially, I mean, it's Flatpak, that's fantastic.

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's easy to try and it's classic open source software.

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yeah, you do end up...

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You do end up having to install a theme twice.

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
One is the actual system and one is a Flatpak.

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That is a little weird, I suppose.

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But today is the big day.

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We've all been kind of holding our breath.

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I think some of us kind of were thinking maybe it wouldn't happen.

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And there was a crack in the armor in Brazil when the regulators did not approve the IBM and Reddit acquisition.

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Nervous little moment.

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Oh, didn't... Nervous little moment.

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But today, at least everywhere else, including the United States,

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Red Hat's acquisition by IBM has closed.

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
They have tweeted out this morning that Red Hat will remain independent and neutral to give customers freedom.

140
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And they've released a video of IBM and Red Hatters talking together to show their commonality.

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So you just kind of just keep looking at me the whole time.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And then we just kind of chit chat back and forth about it.

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But I think that there is a lot of really great affinity between IBMers and Red Hatters.

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Each one of our stories is different.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I think I was probably always destined to be an engineer.

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And actually, initially, I was very much into math.

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So I was really curious, like, how do you go about building systems?

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
People like us that when we see something, we want to take it apart and see how we're from the inside.

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Some of us got our start at an early age.

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I mean, I don't really remember a time where I wasn't interested in technology.

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And I actually learned how to read playing text parser adventure games.

152
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
My father rescued a Commodore pet from the garbage.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Shortly thereafter, he purchased this book for me, which was Beginning Basics.

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And I was like, this is it!

155
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And the video continues on for a bit.

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll have a link in the show notes if you want to watch the entire thing.

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's a cut of some fairly well-known Red Hatters.

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And some not-so-well-known IBMers talking about their common interests, I suppose.

159
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yeah, you've got some distinct cultures working just a little bit closer together now.

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The one message that has been so, so super clear, it was crystal clear at Red Hat Summit.

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It has been really clear since the communication.

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
They have doubled down in every possible meaning of the word on the fact that IBM is going to remain independent.

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So much so now that everyone in the world will be watching to see if that actually is the case.

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yeah, IBM's kind of just saying, alright, keep doing what you're doing Red Hat.

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Make a whole bunch of money and we have easy ways to work with you when we want to resell your stuff.

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, and by the way, OpenShift all the things.

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Of course.

168
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,000
OpenShift all the things.

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Do you have any thoughts on that, Alex?

170
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I know you have to trade carefully here, but do you have any thoughts on OpenShift seems to be a key part of both IBM and Red Hat's future strategy?

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It absolutely is.

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The acquisition is all about the hybrid cloud and making OpenShift into the next rail.

173
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So I'm cautiously optimistic.

174
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I really hope that they maintain the culture that Red Hat currently has.

175
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I love it.

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I think it's great.

177
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's very open.

178
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
There are a lot of opinionated people working at Red Hat and that's what makes the company what it is.

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So leave it alone, leave it as it is, and I think they have a good chance of succeeding.

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I hope so.

181
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So OpenShift does seem to be a pretty good strategy.

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
How do we encapsulate what OpenShift is in a way for the audience that doesn't follow it in a really quick elevator pitch?

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Pretend I don't want to buy anything.

184
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's an enterprise distro of Kubernetes.

185
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Yeah, with surprise, surprise rel sort of at the core of it.

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
When you think about it, Red Hat has this history of taking open source components, contributing to them, building on them, and then packaging it up for real world applications.

187
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yeah, and it's Red Hat recognizing the significant role that Kubernetes is playing in the industry now, which is a trend we've been watching, but more on that later.

188
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So here it is.

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's done.

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It is complete.

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And now we just wait and see.

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I kind of take them at their word from an overall global market strategy, where I'm watching very cautiously is at the projects that make the Linux desktop so much better.

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Things like Network Manager and Bolt and a lot of the Gnome stack itself.

194
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The things that feel a little far away from rel server boxes.

195
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
One point on Gnome, though, is that rel ships with Gnome as the default desktop these days.

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And then that includes Pulse and a bunch of other low level system things.

197
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So I don't think it's all that bad, necessarily.

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's my hope is that because those things do play a part in rel that they're safe.

199
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And I suppose that'll be part of the test too, right?

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If they really do treat it as an independent agent and Red Hat, I mean, obviously they've been comfortable with that expense on their books.

201
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
They're happy with that contribution.

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Kind of a test of, you know, that seems like something a legacy company might like to look at the line item and be like, well, what's the value here?

203
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's not how Red Hat operates.

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's why we like Red Hat.

205
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
See if it keeps going.

206
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That'll be the area that I think we watch the most.

207
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The industry will watch like a lot of their sales tactics and for layoffs and things like that.

208
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm going to watch for contributions to projects that don't seem like they necessarily immediately benefit the bottom line.

209
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And Red Hat's at the center of a lot of that.

210
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
In fact, it's one of the stories I wish we told a little more here on the network.

211
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But it is what it is.

212
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And so we'll be watching.

213
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Do you think that this maybe frees up Red Hat to some degree to so that they don't have to worry about the money and they can kind of rely on IBM to guide them through the market while they just continue to be Red Hat and do what they do?

214
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I mean, if you look at some of the other reviews and some of the TV pundits and these finance people, you know, they're saying that within two years, Red Hat plans to be on the positive side of growth again after the acquisition and all this sort of stuff.

215
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You know, I think maybe IBM is just kind of playing that part of it.

216
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Maybe.

217
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Maybe.

218
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So there's some acquisitions where the acquisition is all cash and there's some acquisitions where the purchasing company borrows like almost 30 to 40 percent of the capital.

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's the situation we find ourselves in with the IBM and Red Hat acquisition.

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And so for that to pay off, when you consider the interest rate on the money that they had to loan to buy Red Hat, the back of the napkin comments math like on Hacker News and whatnot suggests that that interest rate alone, again, this is just what people say on the Internet, could be 700 million dollars.

221
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So there is a there is a bit of a pressure to produce, to grow and continue to grow.

222
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Red Hat's on that trajectory already.

223
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So that's it's a it's a safe bet that that's going to be what happens.

224
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But even if kind of unspoken, it's definitely sitting there.

225
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But in the next two years, Fuchsia could launch and disrupt the entire Linux market.

226
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Stay tuned for the next episode of Fuchsia Unplugged.

227
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
We'll have Fuchsia today here where we cover daily Fuchsia developments.

228
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
But, you know, something could come along and disrupt the market.

229
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But it's very unlikely.

230
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I think it's a safe bet that IBM is making here, but they do need it to pay off.

231
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It doesn't I don't think to answer your question specifically.

232
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I don't think it means they can coast and just afford to spend money on things now.

233
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I think it means they need to actually produce to pay off.

234
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Right. This is not like some large company getting some buying some small startup as a bet to see if it really does well.

235
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
This is a serious strategic move for IBM.

236
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Quite literally one of the perhaps the largest software acquisition ever.

237
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Does this mean that open source has won then?

238
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah, I think it means that open source technologies on cloud infrastructure and server infrastructure and on the back end for developers has won.

239
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And that's where the money is.

240
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I mean, Microsoft made a ton of money for a long time that way, too.

241
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What a what a what a wild, wild, wild, wild 2019.

242
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
We're going to do a special next week that is a reflection on what all has happened in 2019 so far.

243
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
See if it was in line with where we thought things are going.

244
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Because honestly, I mean, so much we kind of just need to take a little break and assess.

245
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Otherwise, I'm going to not be able to keep track of it for the end of the year.

246
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's remarkable.

247
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
So we've had our quote research team on it doing the research.

248
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But also the team here on the show has just been like, well, let's let's think about this ourselves here.

249
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And we look back at 2019 already.

250
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Holy crap. Holy crap.

251
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Well, this this might not be unlike anyone's list for major events, but it's still something people are talking about.

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Canonical's GitHub account was hacked this week.

253
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh, it appears a hacker was essentially just creating empty repos.

254
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It looks like like just screwing around.

255
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Nothing actually really got messed with.

256
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And of course, I think all of the actual jewels are on launch.

257
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yeah, that was the first statement I really was.

258
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Don't worry. This isn't where we keep things.

259
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's mostly just a mirror.

260
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Didn't prevent certain pundits from claiming that Canonical needs to throw everything out and start all over again.

261
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I can't believe the crap I see.

262
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It is a good time for a security review.

263
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And before he found out about it, Coder Radio host Michael Dominic was just pointing out to me like how important it is to have your two factor off set up for things like this.

264
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah, what happens is some, you know, contributor somewhere in the chain might accidentally commit their credentials to something and then somebody sees it because there's lots of scrapers to find that kind of stuff.

265
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And it doesn't take it doesn't take like a nation state.

266
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It doesn't take an expert.

267
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It just it just takes somebody who can run a script that finds and scrapes and then they can log in.

268
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's all that happened here.

269
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But Canonical did release a statement saying that they can confirm that on 2019 on seven six of 2019 there was a canonical owned account on GitHub GitHub whose credentials were compromised and used to create repositories and issues among other activities.

270
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Canonical has removed the compromised account from the organization in GitHub and is still investigating the extent of the breach.

271
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But there's no indication that anything for the Ubuntu distribution at all has been affected by this because again, infrastructure for that's on Launchpad.

272
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
They plan to post a public update after the investigation that was launched July 6.

273
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Have you heard anything more?

274
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
No, not yet.

275
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But I haven't heard anything either.

276
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We'll have to stay tuned for that.

277
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yeah, it's just a couple of days ago.

278
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
A lot of people talking about it, though.

279
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Well, I mean, it is it is big news and it's not an event you like to see even if this time, you know, the outcomes were pretty good comparatively.

280
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Yeah, I guess in this case, yay Launchpad.

281
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yeah, I suppose so.

282
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But right. I mean, like, if it did happen on GitHub, maybe that's a consequence of them not really using it.

283
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You know, it's not their source of truth.

284
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So they're less concerned about it.

285
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But it's just a breach of good practice.

286
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah, my understanding of the nature of the breach was it was a contributor who made an accident, a mistake.

287
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And when you have a big organization, that's just it's a thing that can happen.

288
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And perhaps a two factor here played a role, you know.

289
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm sure they know that, though.

290
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
We don't need to tell them how to do it.

291
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So let's talk about the Raspberry Pi, because that also made big news recently.

292
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And there has been some wonkiness with the Raspberry Pi power source.

293
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I got to say, Joe Rez right here.

294
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't know if you heard of this guy.

295
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh, yeah.

296
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
He's a fantastic podcaster.

297
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yeah.

298
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yeah, he's new.

299
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Upstart.

300
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yeah, I just tuned into his late night Linux podcast.

301
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
First time I ever listened to it in my life.

302
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And he seems to be really on top of this Raspberry Pi stuff.

303
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeah.

304
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
He also has this podcast called Linux Action News.

305
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What do they like cover sort of relevant news stories in a quick and timely format?

306
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I don't know.

307
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I can't watch their faces talking to a large microphone on YouTube, so it's not for me.

308
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But my understanding is they recently reviewed the Raspberry Pi 4.

309
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That's my understanding.

310
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Got their hands on it and everything.

311
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I came across it because he was one of these guys who was bellyaching early on on Twitter about the heat issues of the Raspberry Pi.

312
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And then later on was bellyaching about the weird charger and how you can't just use any old USB-C.

313
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
And I don't know who this guy is.

314
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
He seemed like a real grouch.

315
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So I started following him.

316
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And lo and behold, it appears that the Raspberry Pi folks have admitted to a faulty USB-C design on the Raspberry Pi 4.

317
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And this Joe guy must have called it.

318
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I just can't even with this.

319
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Maybe a fix will be inbound, but it may have to be a hardware fix.

320
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
This is being detailed by Tyler Ward.

321
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The Raspberry Pi 4 has a non-compliant USB-C charging port and doesn't work with many chargers as it should.

322
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Thanks to the open nature of the Raspberry Pi, Ward was able to discover that the Raspberry Pi didn't design its USB-C port correctly.

323
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And as you know, Chris, USB-C, well, just a little bit complicated.

324
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Apparently.

325
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
In this case, two CC pins on the USB-C port itself are supposed to each get their own 5.1 kilo ohm resistor.

326
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The design this latest Pi used, well, they use their own custom design that, I mean, one upside was it allowed them to share a single resistor.

327
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Oh, good.

328
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,000
But this is not a compliant design and therefore breaks compatibility with some of the more powerful USB-C chargers out there.

329
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So there you are sitting with your Pi and you've got this great, you know, really nice, like say laptop charger that I have for my laptop.

330
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'd like to be able to use.

331
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yeah, you can't because whether your USB-C charger works with the Pi 4 has to do with whether it uses what's known as an e-marked cable.

332
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:34,000
E-marked cables are fully featured USB-C cables with chips inside that negotiate power management, accessory modes, data rates and other communication specs.

333
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
So like this chip must detect something's not right and not supply the correct amount of power.

334
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yeah, right. So since the Pi 4 USB-C port is wired incorrectly, these smart cables basically just say this is an audio adapter accessory.

335
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That's what it gets classified as.

336
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Oh, interesting.

337
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And then it just refuses to charge them because it says this is not standard.

338
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's just not going to work.

339
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
So those are more expensive and they come with stuff like laptops.

340
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's where you're mostly going to see them.

341
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Dang it.

342
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I mean, like USB-C was already complicated enough.

343
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I really liked the words from Benson Leung, an engineer at Google.

344
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The USB-C guy.

345
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yeah, the USB-C guy.

346
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah, exactly.

347
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And he titled this snarky post over at Medium, how to design a proper USB-C power sink.

348
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Hint, not the way Raspberry Pi 4 did it.

349
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Oh, ouch.

350
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Instead of trying to come up with some clever circuit, hardware designers should simply copy the figure from the USB-C spec exactly.

351
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Strong words.

352
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yeah, you know, this reminds me of the Nintendo Switch.

353
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It also doesn't have a standard USB-C charging implementation and is a little wonky.

354
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You've got to be careful when you plug USB-C into the Switch.

355
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Well, as these reports started to pop around on the Internet, Eben has admitted that, yep, it does appear that this is an issue.

356
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
And I like this quote.

357
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
How about this?

358
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I expect this will be fixed in a future board revision.

359
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I've already bought mine.

360
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Lucky me.

361
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Uh-huh.

362
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But for now, users will need to apply one of the suggested workarounds.

363
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's, quote, surprising this didn't show up in our quite extensive field testing program.

364
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Thanks, beta testers.

365
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You screwed me.

366
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
They just used probably the cable that it came with, I guess, huh?

367
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That must be it.

368
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You know, I wonder.

369
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So we were surprised about this, right?

370
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
We're all like, whoa, a new Pi just dropped?

371
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Is this a sign it was rushed or was this just slow and they missed it?

372
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Felt like they could customize, save some money, be clever, and it backfired.

373
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I think that's part of it.

374
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Let's use USB-C because we can do our own implementation and be clever.

375
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
By the way, that suggested workaround?

376
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Just use their charger.

377
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Suggested workaround.

378
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
So beware, if you buy a Pi 4, make sure you get the right kind of charger for it.

379
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And that's not that big of a deal.

380
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Or wait for the next board revision, maybe.

381
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah.

382
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And maybe you'll get eight gigs, too.

383
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Although they say that was now a typo in the manual.

384
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
A typo.

385
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
A typo.

386
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I accidentally typed in eight gigabytes.

387
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That was also not caught in their extensive copy editing.

388
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I accidentally typed in eight gigabytes and the board accidentally supports up to 16 gigabytes.

389
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Accidentally.

390
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And I think eight gigabytes was on its own line underneath everything else, too.

391
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Well, all right.

392
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
There you have it.

393
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
So I'll let you know.

394
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
When I get my Raspberry Pi 4, I think I'm going to put a buntremonte on there.

395
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I don't know.

396
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I should ask Wimpy first.

397
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But I'm going to give it a go as a desktop.

398
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It seems actually like, I mean, this is going to be the best one yet for it, right?

399
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
As long as you can stand the heat.

400
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Oh, yeah.

401
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Well, I think in a month or two, there's going to be more than one or two third-party CPU coolers.

402
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You know they're coming.

403
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Oh, yeah.

404
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
With fans.

405
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
There'll be Air Ones.

406
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And somebody ought to take a bet right now in the audience.

407
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Somebody should get like a website set up with a pool.

408
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You know there's going to be a water-cooling YouTube video for the Raspberry Pi 4.

409
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It's just in a matter of days.

410
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So is it 30 days?

411
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Is it 15 days?

412
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Is it five days?

413
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
There's a bet to be had there.

414
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Somebody could win some Dogecoin.

415
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
In the meantime, let's talk about a brand new version of Firefox, which I'm all about.

416
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I wouldn't normally mention an individual release other than this one has such a killer feature.

417
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It's such a small thing, but I just wanted to let you all know about it.

418
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It's now possible to get dark mode in the reader view.

419
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I was hoping this is what you were going to say.

420
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I actually installed Firefox 68 right before we went live doing this show.

421
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Try it out, this new dark mode, and it's fantastic.

422
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Also, just props to Firefox for continuing to develop their fantastic reader mode,

423
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
which I think is the best of the lot.

424
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
One of the best things about using it on the desktop.

425
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Also, you and I are both in agreement now that it renders pages faster than Chrome.

426
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It is snappy.

427
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I feel like the UI might be a little laggier than Chrome,

428
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
but I feel like the page rendering is significantly faster.

429
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I like that they added a feature where you actually have to interact with a page

430
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
before they can prompt you for notifications,

431
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
so it's not just like right there already prompting you for notifications,

432
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
and you can disable having that at all.

433
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
You tell me, wait a minute, that's in 68?

434
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I believe so.

435
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Shut up.

436
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
That is great, Wes.

437
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Oh, man, those notification things.

438
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I don't see it on this page.

439
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I don't see it on this page either, the one we have in the show notes,

440
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
but I'm going to look for that because between the cookie notification

441
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
and the I want to send you notifications and oh, by the way,

442
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
can I have your location stuff,

443
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
and then they have some pop-up about their newsletter,

444
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm about done with the web.

445
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I'd like your microphone so you can chat with a Jupiter Broadcasting

446
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
representative to find the right podcast for you.

447
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Hey, we should probably implement that.

448
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Let's do that real quick.

449
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Also, just a side note,

450
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
we've talked about this more extensively on Linux Action News,

451
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
including where this is going,

452
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
the Firefox 69, the next release,

453
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
will be the final version on Android that has extensions and add-on support.

454
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Oh, that's a big change.

455
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Heads up on that and more details on where Mozilla is taking that,

456
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
which actually long-term is a good direction in Linux Action News,

457
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
but I don't want to make the whole show about Firefox.

458
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I am getting very excited about it though.

459
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm happy to say I've switched back.

460
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm very happy with it.

461
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Now using Firefox as my primary and Chrome as my secondary,

462
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
which was the opposite.

463
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Yeah, kind of Chrome is, if I can get away with it,

464
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
just sort of the media one.

465
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I use it for the Chromecast stuff and some of the DRM stuff maybe,

466
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
if you have to.

467
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Chromecast and just a couple of other things that work better in Chrome

468
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
and that's pretty much it.

469
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
But all my day-to-day stuff is in Firefox and I'm very happy with it.

470
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Very happy with the Sync, very happy with all of it,

471
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
and happy in the direction Mozilla is going in general these days.

472
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm cautiously optimistic they're going to take this services stuff

473
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
and turn it into a way to fund a good web browser

474
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
that has a positive impact on the web.

475
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
We'll see if that's the case.

476
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I know.

477
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I almost just want to just sort of buy it for a while for that reason alone

478
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and also get the benefit of trying it out.

479
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I want them off the search sauce.

480
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
I don't want them hooked to that search sauce.

481
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
They're valuable and it would be nice to have them be able to stick around

482
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and know that they have secure funding.

483
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Just a couple of things in the old housekeeping this week.

484
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
First of all, we have a link in the show notes.

485
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
You'll have to dig it a little bit because it will be a little bit down.

486
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
But we have a Google form to ask for you to submit.

487
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I think it's what, four questions?

488
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'll pull it up right here because I didn't actually pull it up ahead of time.

489
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Yeah, four questions.

490
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
One question.

491
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Yeah, four answers.

492
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Yeah.

493
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Oh, right.

494
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
All right.

495
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
So let me back up.

496
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Oh, jeez, did you make these graphics too?

497
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
This is amazing.

498
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I just saw this.

499
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
That's beautiful.

500
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
So on the Friday stream, we play Who Wants to Be a Millionaire

501
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
and give away some games to people that are in the chat room.

502
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
That's one great reason to show up live.

503
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And generally, we've just been doing typical trivia.

504
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
But we've decided to step it up and do Linux trivia

505
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
and open source and free software trivia.

506
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Doing it right.

507
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And in this game, you need a kind of like easy question,

508
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
medium question, and a hard question.

509
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's actually got a scale of like zero to four-ish.

510
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
That's the largest I've seen in the set.

511
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I'm not sure what the maximum really is.

512
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeah, so you said a difficulty.

513
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
But we have a form right now where you can ask a question

514
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
that the contestant would then be asked

515
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
and then provide us with the correct answer

516
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and then a few wrong answers that sound right enough

517
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
that they could be it to make it challenging.

518
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Am I making sense?

519
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Absolutely.

520
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Yeah, so we have the Linux Millionaire form.

521
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
We'll have linked in the show notes.

522
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
And essentially, our ask here is we'd like to crowd source

523
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
some of these questions that we can ask.

524
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And we could use these on live streams and all kinds of things

525
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
to kind of quiz people like Linux trivia, history stuff.

526
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I like that we'll have this set up ready to go.

527
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
That's fantastic.

528
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
And we'll have a link in the show notes.

529
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I feel like I'm doing a horrible job explaining it.

530
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
But I'm very excited about the potential.

531
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
It's Linux Who Wants to be a Millionaire live on Fridays.

532
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Yeah.

533
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
And we need your help.

534
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Help us out.

535
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
You've got great Linux knowledge.

536
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You've got great questions in there.

537
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Because we want questions that would make even people

538
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
who have been using Linux a while think.

539
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Do be aware of what difficulty you put.

540
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Because we want the easy ones to be easy enough.

541
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
You've got to have some hundred dollar questions.

542
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
What happened to poor cheese on this Friday episode?

543
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
We won't talk about it.

544
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Don't even.

545
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Cheesy.

546
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Don't even give me story.

547
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Cheesy.

548
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I did include a dime question, though.

549
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
We need like some thousand dollar questions

550
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
and a hundred dollar questions.

551
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But we also need like $32,000, $64,000.

552
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
You've been reading LWN for the past 10 years.

553
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yeah.

554
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Awesome.

555
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Yeah.

556
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
All right.

557
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Would you say that cheese had a hard dime of it on Friday?

558
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
No.

559
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
No.

560
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Wouldn't say that, actually.

561
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
It was funny.

562
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Even if it was wrong.

563
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It was still funny.

564
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
All right.

565
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
All right.

566
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Moving on.

567
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Moving on.

568
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Link in the show notes for that.

569
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
We have a bunch of updates to cover now.

570
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Linux Academy is doing new positions.

571
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
They have new content launching.

572
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
So I encourage you to check out links in our show notes

573
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
for that as well.

574
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
A new DevOps professional certification exam has just been updated

575
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
with a new emphasis on the developer tool suite.

576
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
If you don't know what that is either,

577
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
probably worth checking out the links in the show notes.

578
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
They have 28 job openings currently.

579
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
What?

580
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
At least the last time I checked.

581
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
That is crazy.

582
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
A lot of those positions are remote, full-time, full benefits.

583
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Check that out.

584
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Some of them are local too in town.

585
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And then a couple more things.

586
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Our study group, Understanding Burnout, went live on YouTube a few days ago

587
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
and it's really good.

588
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
If this is something you're struggling with,

589
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
you guys know this is something I've struggled with.

590
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Do you work hard?

591
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I mean, are you a person who has a job?

592
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Well, then you probably have struggled with this.

593
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I can tell you this too.

594
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It sneaks up on you.

595
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And there's some really good stuff.

596
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Hayden?

597
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Is it Hayden?

598
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I hate it when I get it wrong.

599
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Major Hayden.

600
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Major Hayden from Red Hat.

601
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Major Hayden.

602
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I got it wrong once and now I'm like,

603
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
it's like a dog that gets scared by fireworks.

604
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I got it wrong once.

605
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So Major Hayden joins L and it's Major Hayden from Red Hat.

606
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And it's really, really, really good.

607
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And then last but not least,

608
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
if you need to learn up on AWS on July 31st,

609
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
we're kicking off another round of totally free study groups.

610
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It's something we do kind of off air with the community

611
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
to help people learn up and pass the AWS cloud practitioner exam.

612
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
That's coming up soon.

613
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Details at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

614
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Speaking of the job market,

615
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
our friends over at System76 are also hiring.

616
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Emma is looking for customer service tech

617
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
to join her happiness team,

618
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
and she has details on her Twitter page.

619
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'm imagining they have a link too

620
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
that you could probably check out.

621
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I assume you have to be able to tolerate pink

622
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
at least a little bit.

623
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
But other than that,

624
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
it seems like a fantastic place to work.

625
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Yeah.

626
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So check out Emma's tweet.

627
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
We have a link in the show notes.

628
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
If you're in their area, go work.

629
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Emma would make an awesome boss.

630
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
She really would.

631
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
That would be awesome.

632
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And let me tell you, that's a fun group to work with too.

633
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
So that would be a great gig.

634
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
If you want to get out there

635
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
and do a little customer service support

636
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
in the greater Denver area,

637
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
check out a link in the show notes for that.

638
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
We're trying to get people hired.

639
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
That's the thing we've been doing.

640
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I wonder if you get like an employee discount,

641
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
one of those sweet Thaleos.

642
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Yeah, you do.

643
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Of course you do.

644
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Yeah, get some sweet Linux rigs too.

645
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
You'd probably have to build it yourself though, I bet.

646
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Oh, yeah.

647
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
That'd be fun.

648
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
That would be killer.

649
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Something I hope we can do

650
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
is get more and more people hired.

651
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
That's something I hope we can do.

652
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It's something I feel like if we could meet a few people

653
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
and we hear a few stories every now and then

654
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
where people have got jobs through the network

655
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
and stuff like that.

656
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
I love hearing that.

657
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
So we'll have links to that as much as we can

658
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
in the show notes.

659
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And that is over where, Wes?

660
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm a little Linux unplugged at that ground.

661
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Slash 309?

662
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Well, I mean, they're all right there on the front page.

663
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
That's true.

664
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
But yeah, we have easy URLs.

665
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You just put the show number.

666
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
This is 309.

667
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Yep.

668
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Links to all that stuff.

669
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
All right.

670
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:57,000
So this week, there has been a lot of news around Mozilla.

671
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
The ISPA labeled them as one of the 2019 internet villains

672
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
along with Article 13 and Wes's good friend, Donald Trump.

673
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
So sorry, Wes.

674
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
This has caused an uproar of conversation.

675
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
We're going to skip the drama this week

676
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
and talk about the technology specifically

677
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,000
at the root of this conversation is DNS over HTTPS.

678
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
But we're going to broaden that up

679
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
and talk about some other secure DNS solutions,

680
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
what the current issue is with DNS in general

681
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
and why people are all upset

682
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
and time providing some solutions you can implement yourself

683
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
to just control all of this

684
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
and not worry about different cloud-hosted solutions.

685
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Is that a good summary of it?

686
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Yeah, I think so.

687
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Wow.

688
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I think it's got some attention

689
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
because in the last segment of the show,

690
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
we were talking about how we see Mozilla

691
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
as generally good actors for the internet at large.

692
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So when you see someone calling them a villain,

693
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
it's a little bit shocking.

694
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
But it does make sense because once you start digging into,

695
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
this is a change to the way DNS works

696
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
and change always makes people mad.

697
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And right now, ISPs in particular

698
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
and enterprise admins the world over,

699
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
they're usually the ones who are in charge

700
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
of where your DNS goes.

701
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
This is essentially it.

702
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So the core issue that the association has, the ISPA,

703
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
is that DNS over HTTPS will bypass ISP DNS servers,

704
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
which will then bypass filtering,

705
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
which will put children at risk, hence the villain label,

706
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
because filtering equals children's child safety.

707
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And I think there's been an added degree of concern,

708
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
let's say, over this because it's not enabled by default anywhere

709
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
or really it's kind of just being tested out.

710
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And Cloudflare was one of the first organizations

711
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
to really adopt it and have publicly available servers to use.

712
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And so Mozilla has been working with them

713
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
in the initial rollout of this technology.

714
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So yes, by default, Cloudflare gets all your DNS

715
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
if you use the DOE technology.

716
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Yeah, so Mozilla has been working on this.

717
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
Google has as well.

718
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
We'll get to that in a moment.

719
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
And with Mozilla's implementation,

720
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I can't speak to Chrome's,

721
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
but Mozilla's implementation uses Cloudflare.

722
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
So you turn this on and it uses Cloudflare DNS.

723
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
So the most technically literate counterargument

724
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,000
against DNS over HTTPS has been that it enables centralization of DNS

725
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
and it gives Cloudflare, which people, I would presume, think is evil,

726
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
more control and more information about what people are doing online.

727
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
So you go from dispersed DNS where it's a bunch of different ISPs,

728
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
aka Comcast, to it's Cloudflare.

729
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And that is technically a valid argument and concern, I should say.

730
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
It's not technically valid, but it is a valid concern.

731
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,000
We have to, and this is how the conversation I feel I should proceed

732
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
from here on, is we have to separate the implementation from the technology.

733
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
All things can be implemented poorly and be compromised.

734
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Encryption can be implemented poorly and be compromised.

735
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
DNS over HTTPS can be implemented poorly and lead to monitoring.

736
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
So while that is a valid argument,

737
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Mozilla's implementation, and others will vary,

738
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
but Mozilla's implementation allows you to specify your own DNS servers

739
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
if you choose to, it's just using Cloudflare by default.

740
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
And devil's advocate, just for a second, who else could they use?

741
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Because if you turn this feature on, how many millions of DNS requests an hour

742
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
all of a sudden does that provider receive?

743
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Who else could handle that level of traffic and support this service?

744
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Because it's not traditional DNS.

745
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
You're now taking these DNS requests over port 443 HTTPS.

746
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Yeah, the flip side is, yeah, Cloudflare's doing a lot of work,

747
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
spending real money to provide this service,

748
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
even if you don't trust why they might be doing it.

749
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I do think it's kind of interesting, and I think we should make sure

750
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
we bring our friend Drew in on this,

751
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,000
because I know he has a lot of experience in this area.

752
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You do as well.

753
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I can appreciate the admin side of this, too.

754
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
It is a big change to the way DNS works,

755
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
and there's a lot of techniques that people have learned

756
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
and are legitimate from just running an internal only DNS server

757
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
or trying to do perhaps what you consider essential filtering,

758
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
and those techniques may have to change in this implementation.

759
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But the flip side is when we think of maybe countries

760
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
with governments we don't like or censorship we don't agree with,

761
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
we want that power to be in the individual.

762
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
The other part, too, is this could happen all the time, right?

763
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Browsers can already make web requests,

764
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
so this is really just a culture change.

765
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
It's not really a technology change.

766
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Yes, it's a new standard, yes, interruptibility,

767
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
but it's not really giving the browser any more power in a strict sense.

768
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I tend to like to think about this, too, beyond the browser.

769
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
This might be the first implementation,

770
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
but you could see a future where almost every application

771
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
has its own DNS servers baked in that it's doing over HTTPS.

772
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Telegram or WhatsApp would be fantastic candidates

773
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
because a government isn't likely going to shut down Cloudflare,

774
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
because if they block Cloudflare,

775
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
they're breaking the Internet for their users.

776
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Right.

777
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
So what are they going to do?

778
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
If I were Telegram, I'd have a version in development right now

779
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
that's already using this.

780
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Drew, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this part.

781
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
The thing that drives me crazy as an old sys admin

782
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,000
is there's value in having every application on your network

783
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
using a common DNS.

784
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Yes.

785
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
So DNS is absolutely one of the most important functions of the Internet.

786
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
It's the domain name service,

787
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,000
which will provide an IP address when you give it a host name.

788
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And that host name could be something local

789
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
or it could be something on the Internet.

790
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Google.com isn't really Google.com.

791
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
It's a string of octets that you're going to string together

792
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
to create a web address.

793
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
So you need DNS to do that.

794
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Now, the flip side of that is most people are using their ISPs DNS by default.

795
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
You get a dynamic address when you connect via DHCP,

796
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,000
and they tell you, okay, use this DNS address via DHCP.

797
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
So if you want to use a different DNS service,

798
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
you do have to go in and manually make that change.

799
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Or if you're using static IP,

800
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
you're going to have to manually enter that DNS server anyways.

801
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:47,000
So realistically, you can do a full network DNS service

802
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,000
and not have to worry about doing it in a specific app or specific apps

803
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
just by changing the DNS service that your router is handing out

804
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
to all of your devices.

805
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
That is certainly a thing.

806
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And I did want to point out,

807
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Cloudflare isn't the only game in town for this.

808
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Google does support it, as does Clean Browsing, CZ.nic, and Quad9.

809
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
They all have DNS over HTTPS support already.

810
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Now, I haven't actually used those.

811
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I've only tested the Cloudflare implementation,

812
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
but presumably you could get those working

813
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
if you trust them more than Cloudflare or Google.

814
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Sure.

815
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And we'll talk about here in a moment some ways you could do it yourself

816
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
on your LAN and maybe even set yourself up

817
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
so that way you could use one of these technologies to say,

818
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
if you're on an airplane, get access to the internet without actually paying.

819
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
But that's a different technology.

820
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,000
We'll get there in a moment.

821
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Byte, you had a tech question at the top before we dig into all this.

822
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Go ahead.

823
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Yes.

824
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
So I went to a talk about someone who is very skilled with DNS,

825
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:02,000
and he told that using DNS over HTTPS causes that we need to be identified

826
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
to get our content.

827
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And with the HTTPS, there are a lot of flags that can identify us

828
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
to get us anonymous.

829
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,000
So what I'm very curious about is what kind of information is being sent

830
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
that is identifiable and what keeps us anonymous.

831
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I actually think this is one of the technical arguments for DNS over HTTPS.

832
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
There is a consideration here of it is more identifiable in some ways

833
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
because you have more information being negotiated at that layer.

834
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
That's true.

835
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
I mean, I would say just go take a look right now.

836
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
There are kind of two competing,

837
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,000
at least there are two common sort of standards for how this is going,

838
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
and that's being resolved.

839
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
You can go take a look at their open specs,

840
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
so go see what kind of data is there.

841
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And then one of the upsides at least is the rest of it is just standard HTTPS.

842
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So if you're not willing to connect to the site,

843
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
a lot of the big implementations are going to be connecting to services

844
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
you're probably already connecting to.

845
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
If you trust them for regular web traffic,

846
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
probably trust them for this.

847
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So when you're dealing with identity,

848
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
you have the advantages and disadvantages of that.

849
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
The advantage for the user is that the identity of the DNS server

850
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
is also confirmed because it is HTTPS.

851
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
So there is some security you're also gaining

852
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,000
when you consider the fact that today DNS is just plain text,

853
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
and there's no verification of the server that's responding to you.

854
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Yeah, right.

855
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Now, I suppose you could do some things,

856
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
like if you really wanted to try to do some, you know,

857
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
plain text with the dead simple UDP DNS,

858
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
maybe there's some argument there, but you're right.

859
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
The DNS most of us are using right now is just totally plain text.

860
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It can be man in the middle, it can be messed with,

861
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
and it can certainly easily be logged.

862
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Can you explain to me now, before we go any further,

863
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
where DNSSEC fits in with all of this?

864
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Because I thought that's where everything was going,

865
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
but that was years ago, and it hasn't gone anywhere.

866
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I mean, I remember Windows 2000 shipped with DNSSEC support.

867
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Well, DNSSEC added ways to be able to assure

868
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
that you weren't being man in the middle,

869
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
but it didn't necessarily add all these privacy features.

870
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,000
And then there's also DNSCrypt, which came out of OpenDNS.

871
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
That is also supported by some of these not universal.

872
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And then there's the simpler, arguably,

873
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
some people consider it technically better,

874
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
just using, you know, DNS with TLS

875
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
and not adding all the HTTP stuff to it.

876
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And that works, too.

877
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
That's on Android 9, for instance.

878
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And a lot of these services support that as well.

879
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I'd like to comment, I saw, you know, DNS over HTTPS,

880
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
it might not be technically the best or even optimal thing,

881
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
but it seems to have legs, and it's good enough, right?

882
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
It's going to be easy for people to implement,

883
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
because HTTP is, like, the most used protocol ever, right?

884
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
We have libraries for it in every single language, everywhere.

885
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
kernel already supports it.

886
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,000
It's simple to interact with.

887
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,000
That's the crux.

888
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
And it's not really worse.

889
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Yep.

890
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
At the sort of base of it, it's easier for developers.

891
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And that is what will make all of the difference.

892
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I mean, they're the ones doing the things, right?

893
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And it can be done at the application level,

894
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
so Google can have their own verified,

895
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
secure DNS servers that they use by default.

896
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
And this is years down the road.

897
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You know, every application, if they choose to,

898
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
can have their known good DNS servers

899
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
and use those by default.

900
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
It'll all be different.

901
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
It'll be radically different, depending on the implementation.

902
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Like, Mozilla has one of the best right now.

903
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Their early implementation in Firefox

904
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
actually has considerations for, like,

905
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
falling back to, like, your systems DNS

906
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
to resolve certain names.

907
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Like, imagine the ramifications of this on an intranet.

908
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Well, Firefox has been thinking about that.

909
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
So they've tried to build in some sort of considerations

910
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
for, like, when you're trying to resolve local servers

911
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
on your LAN.

912
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
It's like, okay, don't use DNS over HTTPS for this.

913
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
But, again, that's software logic,

914
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
and it's not going to be perfect,

915
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
and we're going to have to work these kinds of things out

916
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
for a while.

917
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
And it is a funny, interesting case.

918
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It just reminds us the complexity.

919
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
You know, change was going to come,

920
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
because DNS did kind of need a polishing.

921
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Yeah.

922
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,000
It is maybe problematic for some admins.

923
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
But then again, you're right.

924
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
They're going to build in solutions.

925
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
So if you're out on the admin for your employees' boxes,

926
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
you can also just pre-configure it

927
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
so that Firefox is installed with your DNS servers.

928
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
So there is some advantages for just end users today.

929
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Like, if there are reasons you might want to use DNS over HTTPS,

930
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:26,000
a lot of networks may block using your own DNS server,

931
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
but they're not blocking HTTPS traffic.

932
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Yeah, right.

933
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Or you're traveling abroad, for instance.

934
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I've run into that.

935
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
And instead of having to go full-on VPN

936
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
if you're using Firefox, right,

937
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
you would just tick this on, and suddenly all your sites work.

938
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So we thought, since this is a pretty fun technology

939
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
that has a lot of possibilities...

940
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
And it's open source.

941
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,000
...let's divorce it from all of the drama and potential,

942
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
you know, oh, it could be implemented horribly,

943
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
and let's do our own implementations.

944
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
So the crew went off and did different setups,

945
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
from running on a Raspberry Pi

946
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
to running it up on servers and whatnot.

947
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
And, Drew, I know you had some success

948
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
getting it running on a Raspberry Pi.

949
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I think you ended up even using Pi-hole to do it?

950
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
I did.

951
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,000
So I took an old Raspberry Pi 2 B+,

952
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
so, you know, not exactly a spring chicken here,

953
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,000
and I set it up in about an hour.

954
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
It was easy and works really, really well, and it's fast.

955
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So, you know, first stand up the Pi,

956
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,000
and then what I needed to do was set up Pi-hole itself.

957
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And there are nice, easy instructions on the Pi-hole website.

958
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
We'll have those linked in the show notes.

959
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Now, after Pi-hole is stood up,

960
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
then to really get this going with DNS over HTTPS,

961
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
you've got to set up a little daemon on your system

962
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
that the Pi-hole can pull DNS information from

963
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
and use that as its upstream DNS

964
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
before serving it to your devices.

965
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,000
And doing this with Cloudflare D is astoundingly simple.

966
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
You really just have to pull it down from the Internet,

967
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
put it in your slash user slash local slash bin,

968
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
and then create a system D service to launch it.

969
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
That's it.

970
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Are you essentially seeding your database

971
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,000
with their information, but then future requests

972
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
from that point forward are responded locally on your box,

973
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
and Cloudflare is just completely unaware of it?

974
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Or is it more like a proxy situation?

975
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Right.

976
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,000
So, what you're alluding to is when you have a DNS query,

977
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
your query will go to whatever your DNS server is defined as.

978
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
And if the local or ISP DNS server

979
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
does not have that information,

980
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
it will forward that request to another DNS server to provide it.

981
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
That's how all of these domain names get distributed.

982
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Somebody's got it somewhere,

983
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
we'll keep reaching until we find it,

984
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
is essentially how it works.

985
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
So, you set up Pi-hole as your locally cached DNS,

986
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
and if it doesn't have an address,

987
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
like say I've not gone to slash dot before,

988
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
and I try to go to slash dot,

989
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
okay, Pi-hole doesn't have it cached,

990
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
so it reaches out to whatever you set its upstream DNS as

991
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
to pull that address down before giving it to you.

992
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
And that's what that Cloudflare D is doing,

993
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
is it is acting as the upstream DNS provider.

994
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It essentially opens up a port on the Raspberry Pi

995
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
for the Pi-hole service to query,

996
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
which then runs all of these requests through that HTTPS tunnel

997
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
to pull down results.

998
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
I see.

999
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
So, once the result has been cached,

1000
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
from then on, your Pi-hole is serving the results.

1001
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Yes, exactly.

1002
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And that's what's neat, like whether you use the HTTPS version

1003
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
or just TLS or DNS crypt,

1004
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
if you think about it, a lot of people are running DNS mask

1005
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
or something similar, maybe just for the caching

1006
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
or you're using it to do DHCP or whatever else.

1007
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
When you're doing plain DNS, right?

1008
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
You're still leaking that, your ISP can still see all of that.

1009
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
If you just make this change, suddenly it's encrypted.

1010
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Now, to stay on theme, Drew,

1011
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
you don't actually have to run it on a Raspberry Pi either.

1012
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
You could actually run Pi-hole in a container.

1013
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
You could.

1014
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Now, I haven't tested out getting Cloudflare D

1015
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
running inside a container yet,

1016
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
but there's no reason that you couldn't do that,

1017
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
or you could even run Cloudflare D on the bare metal

1018
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
and have the dockerized Pi-hole query that.

1019
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Sure.

1020
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
We'll have links in the show notes, too.

1021
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
So, there's other... Facebook's got an implementation.

1022
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
There's a couple of different open source ones up on GitHub,

1023
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
so there are a ton of proxies available

1024
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
if you want to start playing with DNS over HTTPS.

1025
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I mean, I could almost see us setting one up as, like,

1026
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
let's do one for us just because...

1027
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I want it on my home network now, too.

1028
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Yeah, and we have no agenda. We don't care.

1029
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
That's really fascinating.

1030
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Now, you gave it a go.

1031
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
How did you experiment with it?

1032
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Yeah, I just set up one on a droplet

1033
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
and then tried to connect my Firefox to it.

1034
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
How did that work?

1035
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
That worked pretty darn well.

1036
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
The configs in Firefox is a little bit weird,

1037
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
so you might have to futz with that a little bit.

1038
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I know I did, but once it was working, it seemed just fine.

1039
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Is there any...

1040
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It's a little clunky.

1041
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
You do have to go to, like, bout config and stuff.

1042
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I didn't notice a ton of change,

1043
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
but I was on a nice home connection, so...

1044
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
So, no real perceptible performance difference?

1045
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Yeah, it was just fine.

1046
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Hmm.

1047
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
What kind of investment would you say it is time-wise

1048
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
and steps to get it working on the droplet?

1049
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Is it packages? Is it a PPA?

1050
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I tried DNS script proxy, and I just kind of got...

1051
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Is it a container or...?

1052
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
You know, I don't know.

1053
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Normally, I try things in the container right away.

1054
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I didn't see one.

1055
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I just kind of ran it because...

1056
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Well, it's written in Go, so they just had to...

1057
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Yeah, you just run it.

1058
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Exactly.

1059
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
That's probably what I would do.

1060
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I was curious about configuring Firefox, all right?

1061
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
So...

1062
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Yeah. Hmm.

1063
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,000
And I've already thrown the droplet away.

1064
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Hmm.

1065
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
So, it looks like...

1066
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I mean, to my count, we've got, right now,

1067
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
one, two, three, or four different solutions now

1068
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
to try to secure DNS, and nothing's really sticking.

1069
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I think this is... I mean, honestly, DOE seems like

1070
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
it's going to have the most legs, at least in the short term.

1071
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Yeah.

1072
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
You know, if Mozilla really does it,

1073
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
when we see it actually shipping in Chrome...

1074
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Well, so DOE, again, DNS over HTTPS,

1075
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
isn't just a Mozilla thing.

1076
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
It is also a Google thing,

1077
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
and I think that's something worth considering.

1078
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
On the mobile versions of Chrome right now,

1079
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
they already support it.

1080
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Google is standing up servers,

1081
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
and there is patches landing in Chromium to support this as well.

1082
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
You can turn it on now.

1083
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
So, it seems like they're kind of behind it as well.

1084
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And if you think about it,

1085
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
it's a good business move for them to help people bypass censorship.

1086
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Well, and you were talking about, you know, using it in the app, too.

1087
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
So, they have a JSON API.

1088
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
It's dns.google, and you can just shoot JSON requests at it,

1089
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
and it gives you DNS records, right?

1090
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Like...

1091
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
DNS over JSON?

1092
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Yeah, that's right.

1093
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
2019's just lost it.

1094
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
It's just totally gone off the rails.

1095
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
It's just... I can't believe that's just happened.

1096
00:51:54,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Also, I know it does look like a systemd resolve, the systemd DNS implementation.

1097
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
It doesn't do HTTPS, but it does do DNS with TLS,

1098
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
so you can get stuff there, too.

1099
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
All right.

1100
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Well, we have a whole bunch of resources to point people to,

1101
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
including client resources, stuff you can run on the server,

1102
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
explanations of the different DNS securing solutions,

1103
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
and what's wrong,

1104
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
and, of course, the guides to implementing your own.

1105
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
We need to set something here at the studio.

1106
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
We don't necessarily need HTTPS over DNS,

1107
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
but we do need a good DNS solution here at the studio.

1108
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
So, thinking about doing PyHole in a container just for fun.

1109
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
And PyHole's great.

1110
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
It's got a lovely little UI.

1111
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
It's easy to set up.

1112
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I like that it also has just a script you can run.

1113
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
So, you can run a container, you can run it on a Pi,

1114
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
or just install it on your distro.

1115
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Geez, you love you some little PyHole, don't you?

1116
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Yeah, yeah, I set it up.

1117
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
I played around with it for a little bit.

1118
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I did notice that there are some issues if you are standing it up on a Pi.

1119
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Most routers nowadays will let you set a custom DNS.

1120
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,000
However, if you do that and still have your router set up to do DHCP,

1121
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,000
you could run into some problems like I did,

1122
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
where it's just extremely slow.

1123
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And I think that's essentially because it's trying to find

1124
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
all the devices on the network and it can't.

1125
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I could be wrong there, though.

1126
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I probably am.

1127
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Also, whenever you get going, ideally what you want to do

1128
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,000
is just go ahead and tick the box on your router, turn off the DHCP server.

1129
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
PyHole has the DHCP servers built into it.

1130
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Just fire that up, and then Bob's your uncle, and boom, it's off and running.

1131
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
And after that, I lit it up and I had no problems.

1132
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Also, if you don't want to affect your entire network when you're testing this,

1133
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
you can just stand up the Pi and then just point your network adapter

1134
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
at that DNS server.

1135
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So, if you actually want to work with PyHole that way,

1136
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,000
you can do that and maybe you won't get your wife so angry

1137
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
that you brought down the internet.

1138
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Just don't even use DHCP at all.

1139
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Yeah, just bypass that.

1140
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Now, one thing that I will bring up is I was talking to Cheese

1141
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
about the issues he was having, and you've got a, it's a Nighthawk, right?

1142
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Yeah, it's a Netgear Nighthawk 7800, I believe is what it is.

1143
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
What I was reading about that is it does not let you define

1144
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
what the DHCP server in the Nighthawk will provide down to clients.

1145
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,000
So, you are having to set it as the router system-wide DNS server,

1146
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
which is typically not recommended.

1147
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
You want that to be something upstream, but then your DHCP clients

1148
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
get something else from them.

1149
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
So, I think that's where you're running into issues.

1150
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
If you do have a router where you can define the DNS server

1151
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
that DHCP hands out, then that's going to be a much better way,

1152
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
and then you don't have to move your DHCP to the Pi-hole itself.

1153
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
But you do now owe Drew some money.

1154
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,000
He'll have your invoice arrive shortly.

1155
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I'll get you some brews.

1156
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Sounds good.

1157
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Now, Alex, you've been rather quiet on the subject.

1158
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Is this anything you've messed around with using Pi-hole

1159
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
or any of these kinds of shenanigans?

1160
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
A little while ago, the guys over at Linux Server

1161
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
did an ad blocker kind of challenge,

1162
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
and we ended up running AdGuard Home, a few of us out of a container,

1163
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
and that worked pretty well.

1164
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Some of them experienced slowness with encrypted DNS.

1165
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I'm wondering, geez, whether that is the same symptoms that you had or not.

1166
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I don't know.

1167
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Generally speaking, though, it's really easy to set up one of these ad blockers.

1168
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Yeah, it's really easy, and it works across all of your devices.

1169
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
That's one of the really cool things for me.

1170
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Trying to install an ad blocker on Android, for example, without routing is a tricky task,

1171
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
but if you are doing it at the router layer or something like that,

1172
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,000
then the network level, you're able to stop ads before they even reach your device,

1173
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
which is super-duper cool.

1174
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Sweet.

1175
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yeah, that's compelling to me.

1176
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
All right.

1177
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Well, that's fun.

1178
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
We have a whole bunch of resources in there,

1179
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
but one thing I'd kind of like to ask from the audience on this particular topic,

1180
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
if you go over to linuxonplug.com slash contact,

1181
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
or you could just tweet me at chrisles.

1182
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Are you concerned about Cloudflare?

1183
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I get the concerned sort of vibe from the community, and I feel it myself,

1184
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,000
but I don't have an articulate reason.

1185
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I couldn't just sit here and Mike can tell you why.

1186
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I would love to hear some, yeah, right?

1187
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
And I hate to condemn them just because they're successful.

1188
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I don't want to do that.

1189
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
So I'd love to hear some thoughts on it, linuxonplug.com slash contact.

1190
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
You know, maybe compare some contrasts,

1191
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
because as you say, there are limited solutions for general providers,

1192
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
so who's a better org to trust?

1193
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Yeah, who's another?

1194
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Who could handle that scale?

1195
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
That's great.

1196
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Include that, please.

1197
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
But also remember, the implementation is not the technology.

1198
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
There are other providers, and you can roll your own.

1199
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
That's the beauty of open source.

1200
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
It doesn't have to be Cloudflare.

1201
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
You can stand it up on a Raspberry Pi, a DigitalOcean droplet,

1202
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
anywhere you can possibly get access.

1203
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
So it's a cool tech, and you can be in control of it.

1204
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
It just depends on the implementation.

1205
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

1206
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
All right, well, as we come in for a landing here,

1207
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
so we're going to turn off the bathroom and turn on the seat buckle signs.

1208
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Wes, you got to sit down now.

1209
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Always going for that mile high club.

1210
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
We got some really good feedback that we need to incorporate right here

1211
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
in the studio, Wes.

1212
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I'm telling you what.

1213
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I think this is the way to go.

1214
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,000
It's about wandering windows in XFCE, and it comes in from Peter.

1215
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
He says, hi, Chris.

1216
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
He says, try installing DevilsPi.

1217
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
You use the terminal with X win info to obtain the window stats,

1218
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
like the size, its PID, and then you can use DevilsPi to write a profile

1219
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
about each important window, save each one,

1220
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
and then make sure the DevilsPi daemon runs on startup.

1221
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
To fine tune the adjustments positions,

1222
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
you can tweak each attributes of each window.

1223
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
You could disable the daemon altogether if you don't want it, et cetera.

1224
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
But the idea is it solves your window sizing problems,

1225
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
positioning, and attribute problems.

1226
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Easy for me to say.

1227
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Ah, so you've solved the problem that you created

1228
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
when we switched away from Plasma.

1229
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Yeah, yeah, the very thing that Kwin had built in that I love,

1230
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
the Kwin rules.

1231
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
That's what DevilsPi solves.

1232
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Actually, this does look pretty neat.

1233
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
And it's broken out as a little standalone application.

1234
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
We could totally use it.

1235
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,000
And also, by the way, there's a newer version called DevilsPi 2,

1236
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
which we'll have a link in the show notes.

1237
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,000
It could be worth checking out.

1238
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Because he says here, he's got it really laid out.

1239
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,000
He calls it his perfect tool, and the project describes it even as crack.

1240
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
They say it's crack once you get it just right.

1241
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
You get all your windows just the way you want them on your desktop,

1242
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,000
even their transparencies and everything, and you set it once,

1243
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
and then you hit a button, and it scripts it, and it lays them all out.

1244
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Maybe you're finally ready for a tiling window manager.

1245
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
You stop it.

1246
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
You stop it right now.

1247
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
You stop it right now.

1248
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Actually, I'll tell you what.

1249
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:05,000
The guys and gal over at Choose Linux, our very own Drew here on the show

1250
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
and Elle are now joining Joe Rez on the unit.

1251
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Have you heard of Joe Rez?

1252
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Oh, that guy.

1253
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Yeah, right.

1254
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,000
He's sure popping up a lot.

1255
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I'm a fan of the Joe Rez podcast, but that's all I know about.

1256
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
I've heard he's got a few other shows, and one of them is called Choose Linux.

1257
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
New to me.

1258
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:26,000
But I do know of Drew and Elle, and they are joining this new upstart

1259
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:32,000
in podcasting to discuss an i3-based desktop this week.

1260
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Is there anything we could tease, Drew?

1261
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Is there anything you could tease about that that wouldn't be given away?

1262
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Because that, I've got to say, has got me kind of thinking about it.

1263
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1264
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,000
So with the Devil's Pie thing, that's exactly what I was thinking is,

1265
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
well, you could just do this in i3.

1266
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And if you wanted i3 with like desktop environment niceties,

1267
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
well, that's where Regolith comes in.

1268
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And we did a pretty deep dive, and I even contributed some issues

1269
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
to their GitHub after doing that challenge.

1270
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,000
So it's a really cool project, and tune in to find out more.

1271
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Also a look at Rosa, as well as this really cool game that Wimpy wrote in Bash.

1272
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Oh, it's so amazing.

1273
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
It's so neat.

1274
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So that's all in the latest episode of Choose Linux.

1275
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Well, it might not be the latest as you're listening,

1276
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
but it'll be sort of in the recent.

1277
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Go check that out as well.

1278
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I'd say just subscribe, and then you'll get all the episodes.

1279
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Yeah, that is sound advice, Wes Payne.

1280
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Brilliant.

1281
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Chooselinux.show for that, and chooselinux.show slash 12,

1282
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,000
specifically for that one about Regolith, which it does sound pretty cool.

1283
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I've got to admit.

1284
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
If you'd like to give us your feedback, again, that's linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

1285
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
And give a big shout out to Linux Academy.

1286
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Go over to twitter.com slash linuxacademycom and say,

1287
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
hey, thanks for your support of Linux Unplugged and at Jupyter Signal.

1288
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
We sure appreciate it.

1289
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Share them some love over there, because it's their backing that makes these shows possible

1290
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
every single week to not only staff an entire team,

1291
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
to make these shows ad-free as well.

1292
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
That's a huge deal.

1293
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
So give them some love.

1294
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Twitter.com slash linuxacademycom.

1295
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Thank them, because I'm very thankful.

1296
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Sure am.

1297
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Also, go check out all the great shows over on the network,

1298
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,000
jupyterbroadcasting.com.

1299
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Tons of great shows.

1300
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
User Air is one of my favorite shows of all time.

1301
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
If you're not listening, you're missing something really special.

1302
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Check it out.

1303
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Now, I'll be off next Tuesday, but we'll have a new show at linuxunplugged.com.

1304
01:01:44,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Jeez, I don't know if you guys know this, but there's an outro.

1305
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Barely made it.

1306
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Barely made it.

1307
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Yeah, so now tomorrow, we all got to show up in our wizard robes.

1308
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
We're going to have to burn some incense, and we're going to have to really get zen

1309
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
to talk about what-

1310
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
You don't sleep tonight.

1311
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
You're going to need to just-

1312
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Yeah.

1313
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
No, you're going to need to-

1314
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Meditate.

1315
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Yeah.

1316
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
We're going to need to talk about what has been a crazy 2019.

1317
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
We are, this little behind the scenes info, we're pre-recording next week's episode,

1318
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
taking the family on a little trip.

1319
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Man, am I excited about this episode.

1320
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I've been really enjoying doing these specials.

1321
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
We just started doing these one-off specials from time to time.

1322
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Keep it fresh.

1323
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I don't know.

1324
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,000
I really like it.

1325
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
It's nice to deep dive.

1326
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Absolutely.

1327
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Well, I think that that's kind of what you would get from a lug, right?

1328
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Once you go sit down, and there might be that topic one day, and it's just DNS over HTTPS

1329
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
or TLS or-

1330
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Yeah, it's true.

1331
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Sometimes there's a special guest or an interview, and sometimes we focus on an in-depth topic.

1332
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Barbecued me some brats last night.

1333
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
How were they?

1334
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Good.

1335
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Man, the JB title thing still isn't working.

1336
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,000
How come that's not working?

1337
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Wes?

1338
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Geez.

1339
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:22,000
So it's probably just that your browser has it cached, because it was a 301.

1340
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Guys, what do I do?

1341
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
It's probably that you're using DNS over HTTPS.

1342
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Oh my God, how amazing is it I'm having a DNS issue after this?

1343
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
That's perfect.

1344
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I can tell you the IP address.

1345
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
That is so great.

1346
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I got it.

1347
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I got it.

1348
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I opened up a private session, and you're right.

1349
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
It's working just fine.

1350
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,000
All right, so we got to go over to JBtitles.com and vote.

1351
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Yeah, we did, funny enough, have a little laugh.

1352
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
You know, if I was using our own DNS server, this wouldn't have happened.

1353
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
That's right.

1354
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
This wouldn't have happened.

1355
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Or it would have been cached, and actually it would have been a problem for all of us.

1356
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
One of the two.

1357
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
It is weird when you were talking about Cloudflare, because I do kind of feel the same way.

1358
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
It's very apprehensive about them.

1359
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Yeah, bro, but lava lamps.

1360
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Anything that's a centralization of power makes me nervous.

1361
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Yeah, that's what it is.

1362
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Well, so cheesy, who do you have your upstream set as?

1363
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Is it Google?

1364
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Can you play a little millionaire music as he answers this?

1365
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
It's dime dot dime dot dime dot dime.

1366
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,000
We should confess.

1367
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Let's do a little confession.

1368
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Wes, do you know at home, is your upstream provider just your ISP?

1369
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
No, no, it's almost never my ISP.

1370
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Yeah.

1371
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
You know, I kind of do like Google's resolver.

1372
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I find that they, when I make DNS changes, theirs is the quickest.

1373
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
I've tried Cloudflare's a little bit when they made that announcement.

1374
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I was curious to just play with it.

1375
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:44,000
I don't know what mine is right now off the top of my head, but probably one of them is the 8844 Google one.

1376
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And then I've used, you know, I've looked at other lists and used a couple other providers in the past.

1377
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
And I don't mind my local ISP.

1378
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I'm lucky to not have something like Comcast at home.

1379
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,000
So that would probably realistically be fine.

1380
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Yeah.

1381
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I use a mix of OpenDNS and Comcast DNS.

1382
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And at home, I use my ISP's DNS because it's a little rural local ISP.

1383
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I know the business folk.

1384
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
What about you, Alex?

1385
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Who are you using for your DNS?

1386
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Cloudflare?

1387
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Oh, my gosh.

1388
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
What about you, Drew?

1389
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Who are you using for your upstream DNS?

1390
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Well, definitely not Comcast because that's my ISP.

1391
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
And I'll be damned if I give them my request.

1392
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
That's right.

1393
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I'm using Cloudflare over HTTPS right now.

1394
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
You're keeping that setup, huh?

1395
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Yeah.

1396
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Why not?

1397
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,000
I love Drew.

1398
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Absolutely.

1399
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,000
That's awesome.

1400
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
But I have used Google in the past as well.

1401
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,000
There is an app you can download that kind of benchmarks all the different name servers and all that from your system.

1402
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,000
And I seem to recall that Cloudflare was the fastest.

1403
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
So why wouldn't I go with that?
