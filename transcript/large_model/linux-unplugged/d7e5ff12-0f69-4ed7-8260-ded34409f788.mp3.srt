1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
So there's one thing I thought we'd talk about before the show starts, and that's the Omega

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,000
2, a $5 Linux computer with Wi-Fi built in.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That is nuts.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And of course, it's on Kickstarter with Kickstarter music.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We use development boards to build all sorts of cool stuff.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,840
Most development boards on the market fell short of our expectations.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,880
They're bulky, confusing to set up and over complicated.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,680
We usually spend far more time reading the documentation than actually using them to

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,680
build things.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Today, we're changing that.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
That is one of the dumbest statements I've ever heard.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,320
Say hello to the Omega 2, the world's simplest development board.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,760
The Omega 2 is tiny.

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,840
At less than a quarter of the size of your credit card, it can easily fit into any project.

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,560
But don't be fooled by its size.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,640
The Omega 2 is powerful.

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,160
It is a full Linux computer.

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,640
That's right, this tiny purple thing runs the same operating system that powers some

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,640
of the world's most efficient infrastructure.

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,720
The Omega 2 works out of the box.

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,720
It comes with built in Wi-Fi and onboard storage, so it comes to life the moment you power it

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,720
on.

23
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,720
Onboard storage for something that small is impressive.

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,720
Built in Wi-Fi too.

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,660
You can control it with apps just like your regular computer.

26
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:22,340
We even have an app store so you can discover apps created by the community.

27
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,680
The Omega 2 is easy to program.

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,480
In fact, you don't even have to write any code.

29
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,120
It supports Node-RED, a graphical tool that you can use to create programs by simple drag

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,000
and drop.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,720
But if you are into writing code, the Omega 2 supports many programming languages.

32
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,960
So I was a backer of the Omega 1 and also TechSnap host Alan Jude, huge fan of the Omega

33
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,960
1.

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,360
They actually really delivered on the first Omega.

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,640
So they make some pretty funny claims, but they are already, because of their past success,

36
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,720
they are just, look at this, they are crushing it with a goal of $15,000.

37
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,640
They have raised $268,392.

38
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:15,560
Holy smokes, so the Omega 2 is coming.

39
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,760
I don't know, I'm interested, especially with the built-in Wi-Fi.

40
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,760
Incredible.

41
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
Yeah.

42
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
I wonder how...

43
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
This is considerably incredible.

44
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,440
Can I just back that right now?

45
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:36,400
With Wi-Fi and storage built-in for $5, will it really be $5 when it ships?

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,540
See if you pledge $10, you get your hands on the Omega 2 Plus, double the memory and

47
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,400
storage and double the fun.

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,880
And it includes a built-in microSD slot and shipping by November too.

49
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
Wow, really?

50
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,360
I guess that they've got the supply chain down.

51
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,840
Yeah, they've got the supply chain, look at that, look at that compared to a size, that's

52
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,760
compared to a cherry right there.

53
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,000
That is amazing.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,140
That is amazing.

55
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:20,280
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 157 for August 9th, 2016.

56
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,640
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux podcast that's wrenching all of the news out

57
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,560
of the dry August month.

58
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
My name is Chris.

59
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
My name is Wes.

60
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
Did I get that right, Wes?

61
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
Pretty good, pretty good, Chris.

62
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
I like it.

63
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,920
Actually, I thought at the beginning of the week we were going to have a small show for

64
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
you.

65
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
And I hate saying that.

66
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Right.

67
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,240
And I thought, okay, maybe we might end up with a medium-sized show.

68
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,240
We were hoping for a nice, medium, average.

69
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,240
Yeah, because August tends to be a little slow.

70
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
People are on vacay.

71
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Yeah, exactly.

72
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,200
But no, it turns out we have a big show coming up on 157.

73
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,840
Linux botnets are on a rampage, apparently.

74
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,560
And it's because you suck at managing them, at least according to experts, quote, unquote,

75
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,540
will tell you about this ridiculous story.

76
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,920
The guys over at Solace have a pretty nice, solid upgrade.

77
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,840
Humble has a bundle that actually includes some Linux games.

78
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,480
We've got some benchmarks that compare Ubuntu versus Ubuntu on Windows, native versus Windows.

79
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,960
And it's actually kind of interesting.

80
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Snap's got some updates.

81
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:24,920
And then later on in the show, we're going to talk about our favorite SSH hacks.

82
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,940
One of the coolest tools ever invented for internet communications, built right into

83
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,080
our Linux box.

84
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
And there's so many neat things.

85
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,200
So we're going to go around the virtual log and talk about some of our favorite SSH tricks.

86
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,000
And Wes and I will share ours.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,280
Plus, we'll tell you about a new feature in OpenSSH 7.3 that was just released that's

88
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,000
really cool.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,120
Then after all of that, inspired by Noah's app pick this week, I'm going to talk about

90
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,880
how I have recently started using tag spaces to tag and manage my local encrypted text

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:04,440
files with a system that allows me to add keywords and groups and labels and metadata

92
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,120
information on top of my file system.

93
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Whoa.

94
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
Yeah.

95
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
That's very interesting.

96
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
It's tag spaces.

97
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,960
The communities, all credit goes to them, really.

98
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
I tell you.

99
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
You know what?

100
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Somebody pointed me in the direction.

101
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,960
I looked into it.

102
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
And I was damn impressed.

103
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
So I've just started messing around with it.

104
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
I'm going to give you my quick take on it.

105
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,920
But before we do that, we have community updates.

106
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,720
So let's bring in our virtual lug, time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

107
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,720
Hello.

108
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Hello.

109
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Hello.

110
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
Greetings.

111
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
Hello.

112
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
Hello.

113
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,400
So I'm excited to break this next story down with you guys.

114
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Hello.

115
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Hi.

116
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,560
This, you know, I just, I smiled when I saw the headline.

117
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,320
It was one of those where I saw it go by and I'm like, open a new tab, coming back to that

118
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
one later.

119
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,480
And it is now time to share it with you.

120
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:57,240
Linux botnets are on a rampage.

121
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
That's right, Wes.

122
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,040
Not just your average rampage.

123
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Oh, no.

124
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
Oh, no.

125
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,000
A rampage of epic proportions.

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,120
Linux-operated botnet distributed denial of service attacks have surged in the year's

127
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,280
second quarter due to a growing interest in targeting Chinese servers and Wes.

128
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,880
This is according to Kaspersky Labs that was in a report released last week.

129
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Now, I'm scared.

130
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,440
I'm just going to come on right and say it right now.

131
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
I'm scared.

132
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,720
How does Linux fit in?

133
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,360
Well, the Linux server is the go-to platform, they say, for orchestrating denial of service

134
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:34,720
attacks because of its latent vulnerabilities, said Charles King, a principal analyst at

135
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Pund-IT.

136
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,840
A common problem is they're not protected by reliable security solutions.

137
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
He goes on to say.

138
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
Oh.

139
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,040
Is he perhaps a vendor of any of that I could buy for him?

140
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Why don't you Google?

141
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:55,160
I have a hyperlink, but it's Pund-IT, P-U-N-T-IT.

142
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Let's see.

143
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,720
Their URL is Pund-IT.com.

144
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,240
We shouldn't give them any promotion, but that means you got to look for me.

145
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
All right.

146
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,200
So he goes on to say, this is a quote from this principal analyst here.

147
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,740
What the hell is that even?

148
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,800
That makes them prime targets for hackers, especially those that leverage C&C servers

149
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,160
to centrally manage and carry out denial of service attacks.

150
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,880
This is what he told Linux Insider.

151
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,920
Deploying leading security solutions as well as utilizing and updating established Linux

152
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,500
distros can go a long way to protecting against these kinds of issues.

153
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,600
So what are you grokking when you visit their website there, Wes?

154
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,840
They have some solutions they could sell me, perhaps?

155
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,840
Actually not much.

156
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,840
It's a pretty minimal website.

157
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,840
So this guy's a BS guy?

158
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,840
Yeah.

159
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
Oh, my God.

160
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,580
I got to show this on the live stream.

161
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,300
This is embarrassingly bad.

162
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,180
You have to see this.

163
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,760
This is like a WordPress template.

164
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:57,560
This is as low-budge as it gets, and this is a leading principal analyst that is railing

165
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
against.

166
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
OK, so he goes on.

167
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:06,960
This expert goes on to talk about how, and by the way, listen to the logic in this.

168
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,480
Listen to the logic, and tell me how much sense this makes.

169
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
He goes on.

170
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,920
Remember, this is a botnet rampage, breaking news, you guys.

171
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,480
We don't see any changes in tactics.

172
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,200
Brute forcing passwords, exploiting common vulnerabilities in web applications, hijacking

173
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,080
or sniffing wireless communications.

174
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,280
These are old and well-known issues and threats.

175
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:33,640
Now brute forcing passwords, exploiting common vulnerabilities in web applications, and hijacking

176
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,040
or sniffing wireless communications.

177
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:41,960
How is this taking advantage of latent vulnerabilities, quote unquote, in Linux?

178
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,440
Stiffening wireless passwords and brute forcing passwords, that's not latent vulnerabilities

179
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,840
in Linux.

180
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,840
This is trash.

181
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Mm-hmm.

182
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,720
Which, I mean, not to say that there aren't, or that Linux security is a very legitimate

183
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,080
topic, especially in IoT in that rain.

184
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
But yeah, you're right.

185
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,440
What he was saying before really seemed like it was going to be a kernel level or something

186
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
at the core here.

187
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Yeah.

188
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,120
Now, John McCarty, he's got a Cisco cert, and he works for Aztec Consulting, and he

189
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,920
is a direct quote, Linux is becoming more commonplace and used in most embedded systems.

190
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,880
Okay, well, that's actually wrong too.

191
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,320
I mean, Linux isn't becoming commonplace in the server environment, which is the context

192
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
in which he's speaking.

193
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,160
Linux has been commonplace.

194
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,400
So that's, okay, that's a minor thing.

195
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,280
And in embedded systems, yeah, Linux is pretty successful, so is NetBSD, so is Android.

196
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,000
Those are other platforms that are also successful.

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,560
But he goes on to say, these implementations are often not hardened or patched or upgraded

198
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
regularly.

199
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
I agree with that.

200
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,040
Which has led to these systems being compromised and becoming part of a botnet.

201
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,200
I would like to see numbers, because to me, and I absolutely have participated in the

202
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
hysteria.

203
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
I hand up...

204
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,000
I thought you were going to say you participated in a botnet there.

205
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,600
No, no, hand up to the sky.

206
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,920
I have participated in the hysteria, but the hysteria goes something like this.

207
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,920
There are so many unpatched Linux devices all around the world that at any moment the

208
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,560
entire infrastructure could go Mr. Robot on us and we could all come crashing down.

209
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,960
Oh my God, all of the patches.

210
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,880
That's the hysteria.

211
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,880
But we actually haven't had a doomsday scenario yet.

212
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,480
There hasn't been that moment where everything's come crashing down.

213
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,640
It is definitely reasonable and logical to be concerned, prepared, and thoughtful about

214
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
this issue.

215
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,680
But it is not necessarily reasonable to be so hysterical to say that Linux botnets are

216
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,200
on a rampage because people can sniff Wi-Fi and crack passwords.

217
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,600
There's a cognitive disconnect here.

218
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,360
I also wonder who exactly this article is targeting, because it's either just the lazy

219
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,520
sys admins, but there's not a lot of technical details.

220
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,920
And it really doesn't help a desktop Linux user to do anything except for maybe go try

221
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,960
to buy antivirus software that they don't need.

222
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
You know what?

223
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,840
We'll bring up the antivirus software when it comes back to the Ubuntu on Windows benchmarks.

224
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,920
Turns out, big, big difference there.

225
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,680
All right, so just wanted to put that out there.

226
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
You'll see the news.

227
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,520
Linux botnets on a rampage and it just, I scratch my head.

228
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,120
I don't see Ikey or Josh in the mumble room today.

229
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,000
They're probably too busy blogging or something.

230
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,700
They do a lot of that.

231
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,660
They do have some new features though in Solus, which I wanted to just mention really quickly

232
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,080
because I'm always impressed with at the speed they get this cool stuff out.

233
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,880
They've upgraded their entire Gnome stack from version 3.18 to 3.20.

234
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,880
Nice.

235
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,880
Yeah, I know.

236
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,480
That's not just nice because Gnome 3.20 is pretty solid.

237
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,280
It also means you get things like Flatpak, but it's also, what's really nice is a lot

238
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:51,560
of the GTK desktop distros, not all of them, and with some significant missing notable

239
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,240
ones, but a lot of them are all landing on 3.20.

240
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,760
It seems like a milestone release.

241
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,440
Yeah, it's becoming a nice base, reliable.

242
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,720
I think the 3.20 will become the GTK platform for a while, and so it's really nice to see.

243
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,320
That's just, I think, I don't know.

244
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Maybe not.

245
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,320
It'd be nice.

246
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,320
It's a nice round number.

247
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
Yeah, and it seems to have a pretty wide adoption.

248
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,020
Another major change in Solus is they've got Linux 4.7 in there now, which of course brings

249
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:21,320
better hardware support and under the hood improvements like AMD GPU support, PowerPlay

250
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:27,080
support, NVIDIA GeForce 800M support, and Maxwell support, as well as C720 trackpad

251
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:35,280
support, finally, and last but not least, USB 3.1 support, as well as support for third-party

252
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,920
generation or random generation of Thunderbolt IDs, Polaris architecture support, multiple

253
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:49,040
Radeon features, and Skylake improvements, as well as whatever SKL, RAPL support is.

254
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,040
In color management.

255
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,840
It's a color management thing that's way beyond.

256
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
Yeah, me too.

257
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
But apparently it's in Solus.

258
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,120
It sounds like a great kernel to have.

259
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
It does sound like a great...

260
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
You know what?

261
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
It sounds like a great distro.

262
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
Yes, it does.

263
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,680
Legitimately, me, I'm always the one that's like, oh, it doesn't have these packages.

264
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:12,960
But if Aiki could get over his apparent philosophical hump about SNAPs and more and more stuff started

265
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,880
coming out of SNAPs, I could use Solus's...

266
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:21,680
I mean, imagine if the world's largest Linux podcast was using SolOS, or however it's pronounced,

267
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,680
on its desktop.

268
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,320
And not only would I be using SolOS on my desktop, but I'd be screwing up that pronunciation

269
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,520
all the time, so they'd be getting multiple name mentions.

270
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
It's great.

271
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
It's great.

272
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,120
And so if they just implemented SNAP support, I could almost do it.

273
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
It's ironic, isn't it?

274
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
It's ironic.

275
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
Is this your tacit endorsement?

276
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
What's that?

277
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
Oh.

278
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
Hello, sir.

279
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,120
Wait a minute.

280
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Wait a minute.

281
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Wait a minute.

282
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,600
Did a wild Aiki just show up?

283
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Like you say his name three times.

284
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,520
He pronounces distro wrong.

285
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
He's there.

286
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,520
Yeah, I love it.

287
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Okay.

288
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,240
So wait a minute, because last time you and I talked, you were like the anti-SNAP guy.

289
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,360
Well, at least you very well articulated the other side, I should say.

290
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
Yeah.

291
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,520
I mean, it's a case of far and against, but I mean, we've been a little bit more flexible

292
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,120
about a couple of things lately, like Electron apps are now allowed in Solus.

293
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,120
Oh.

294
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,120
That is a big step.

295
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
Such as Slack.

296
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,200
Like I was vehemently against that and wanted it to die in a fire, but I've allowed it in

297
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,120
because at the end of the day, once you sit down there thinking, it's like, I'm a C guy

298
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,120
and I'm going to hate basically every bit of software that's ever been written by anyone,

299
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
including myself.

300
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Yep.

301
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,760
So I was like, well, you know, it's not really about what I want, is it?

302
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,880
It's kind of what the users want.

303
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,480
So Electron apps and things like that are now finding their way into the repos.

304
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,480
I mean, we've had Kodi and everything going in in the last few days.

305
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Really?

306
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,480
Wow.

307
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,960
We've had like huge growth in the last few days.

308
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,640
We've completely redone our infrastructure.

309
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,760
You know, we've solved massive bugs that have been there since 1.0 in the last few days.

310
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,440
Complete stack updates, Skylake, Maxwell, Polaris support, everything's just landed.

311
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:02,000
So what I've said is I would allow snaps as a secondary deployment mechanism, but never

312
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
as a primary.

313
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I think that makes sense.

314
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I mean, yeah.

315
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,300
I mean, if you wanted that available, like then yes, that could be done, but I mean,

316
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,480
as a primary mechanism, that's kind of what I'm trying to get across.

317
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,480
Mm-hmm.

318
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,480
Yeah.

319
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,320
And I don't know if everyone agrees with you on that point, but I can see your perspective

320
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,320
on it for sure.

321
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,320
Yeah.

322
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,800
I mean, we spoke about the difficulty of dev deployment, didn't we, before as one of the

323
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,760
main reasons for wanting something like Snap to exist.

324
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,880
But I mean, you've seen what we've done with this last stack of updates.

325
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,280
That's just kind of not really possible anywhere else ever.

326
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:43,480
So the way that we're built works for us, but as a secondary mechanism, yeah, I mean,

327
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,960
I can make some exceptions.

328
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Yeah.

329
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,400
I think at least for our case, it comes down to like sometimes you just, even if it's a

330
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,000
little bit ugly, there are times where you just need some software.

331
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Very practical.

332
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yeah.

333
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,920
It's not about, it's about like, oh, I have to have this.

334
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
Yeah.

335
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,920
I'd really love this thing.

336
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
Right now, it'll solve my problem.

337
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
I'll uninstall it later and be done with it.

338
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,080
Man, there's even apps where I'll make wine.

339
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,040
I'll use wine as a compromise for that.

340
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,560
And that really saves you something.

341
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,040
What I would really do, really, really, really strongly request though, like if you started

342
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,880
to use Snap, I'd always suggest like whatever the app is you happen to be using, just request

343
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,800
that we put it in a repo and we make sure it's integrated natively.

344
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,400
So do you remember we spoke before about having the maintainers between the package and the

345
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
distribution, right?

346
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,960
We just spoke about updating to GNOME 3.20.

347
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,400
One of the first bugs I hit was actually launching GNOME calendar, which all of a sudden decided

348
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,840
it absolutely required GNOME shell for this one particular setting, which happened to

349
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,480
be, do I show weekdays or not?

350
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,040
And these are the kind of bugs that come up where you need the maintainers because that

351
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,440
could have been deployed as Snap and it's like, yeah, I don't know what I'm doing.

352
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
I don't know how to run.

353
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,200
What the hell, what?

354
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,880
So I think that's where you need that middle ground.

355
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,960
And at the end of the day, we would like to get things integrated better, just so they

356
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,320
run that little bit better for solos.

357
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,280
Like I mean, we've just integrated Golang 1.6.3, Rust 1.10.0.

358
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,760
So you can build these things natively.

359
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,320
You can take advantage of more updates.

360
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,600
And you know, like if you've got an app or something, solos is, you know, we're kind

361
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,360
of going to bend over backwards for app developers.

362
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,200
So as an example, Budgie took something like five or six months to get into Debian after

363
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,120
going through all the political process with Debian and Ubuntu and then getting it sponsored

364
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,840
and monitored because that's how things roll over there.

365
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,840
And that's the same for any new app.

366
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,640
And solos, we kind of need the apps to be here.

367
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,280
So we're going to make sure your app is out there.

368
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,420
And you don't have to wait for a new major release for somebody to get your features

369
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,920
or rely on a snap.

370
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,660
We'll make sure it gets integrated and it's working properly.

371
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,240
So that's kind of our value add.

372
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,680
So having the native forms over the snap packages, it's always going to be preferable.

373
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,260
I will definitely give you this.

374
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,320
You know, you are catching my attention with these releases.

375
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
Yeah, me too.

376
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,560
I'm going, I'm looking at that.

377
00:17:54,560 --> 00:18:00,120
And Ike, I swear I was thinking of you on Saturday because I went to go fire up a game.

378
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,760
I think it might have been Starbound, but I can't remember which one it was.

379
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,560
And I got a bunch of Intel driver errors.

380
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,520
That Solus runtime, man.

381
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Yeah, I know.

382
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
I think about that too.

383
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,520
That's exactly what it was.

384
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,520
I had to go.

385
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,100
Essentially, there's just Arch, Intel, like you really the solution was go use all your

386
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,100
native libraries.

387
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,720
Go get rid of the steam stuff that installs.

388
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,480
I think we've been in the same place with it.

389
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,360
I thought the Solus, I thought, son of a gun.

390
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,280
Well, I've got news for you there.

391
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,840
So you've got, yeah, I was surprised to see this turn up.

392
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,880
So some nice soul has packaged up Linux Steam integration in the AUR.

393
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,640
Yeah, I saw that.

394
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,640
It doesn't install.

395
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,280
Yeah, I forgot why it didn't install for me.

396
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,280
There was.

397
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:48,000
Okay, so you have to move your user bin steam to wherever it's configured, the steam to

398
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,360
really exist, which is going to be like user lib steam or something like that.

399
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,800
Take a look at the package build to see how they're configuring it, but you need to mask

400
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,660
where the steam binary is, but then just install that.

401
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,720
And then, you know, you'll be using LSI instead.

402
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,600
God, I do love Arch though.

403
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,880
This could almost be Arch's slogan.

404
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,960
If it's great, it'll end up in Arch.

405
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,440
Well, and I think that's where something maybe that to go back to earlier, the snaps kind

406
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,720
of play a role, especially if people are good about asking you guys to upstream stuff.

407
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,080
That's kind of what the AUR does for Arch is like a proving gown.

408
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
How much interest is there?

409
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,460
Wouldn't that be interesting if you could derive user interest by watching snap packages

410
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,320
and seeing, okay, well, this is probably something we should just bring in house.

411
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
Huh.

412
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
Interesting.

413
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
All right.

414
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,440
So, let's take a moment and talk about snap since we've been talking.

415
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,680
There's just been a pretty cool update, and then after we talk about this, I kind of wanted

416
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,720
to pick Wimpy's brain because he published a snap package that I am particularly interested

417
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
in.

418
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,220
So, SnapCraft 2.13 and SnapD 2.11 landed with support for downgraded and installed snaps

419
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:55,800
as well as other things like new commands, buy, try, find private, disable, refresh,

420
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,500
and revert.

421
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,560
These new commands let users buy various applications that are being distributed in snappy stores.

422
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,980
Also, they obviously allow other, not just Ubuntu, but other distros to do the same thing.

423
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,920
They also allow you to find private snaps, which I think is an interesting concept, disable

424
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,560
installed snaps altogether as well as downgrade any snap package you've installed.

425
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,820
Now, this is definitely turning on some of the obvious features that snaps can provide.

426
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,360
When logged into a store, snap find dash dash private lets you see snaps that have only

427
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,400
been shared with you.

428
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,400
That's pretty interesting.

429
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,360
So, snaps are getting some pretty cool updates.

430
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,720
And I wanted to pick Wimpy's brain about one of the snaps he published recently about maybe

431
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,120
the process, what it was like.

432
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,920
It's called PodPublish, a tool for encoding and publishing podcast content and assets,

433
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,480
which has been, I think, a fork of something that Stuart Langridge started a while ago.

434
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,320
And I've seen people that work on some of our GitHub projects associated with this.

435
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,240
Wimpy, what is PodPublish and what was the process like of creating a snap of it and

436
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,240
then publishing it somewhere?

437
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:07,800
PodPublish is a re-implementation of BV Publish that's written by Stuart Langridge for publishing

438
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,240
the Bad Voltage podcast.

439
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:15,540
And is this like a bash script or is it something beyond that or is it like a series of prompts

440
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,000
that it asks you for information about the show and does like the tagging and encoding?

441
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,680
No, so Stuart's was a Python implementation and I know Python, so my implementation is

442
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,280
in Python as well.

443
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:37,160
You basically have, in its simple form, you have two commands, encode podcast.

444
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,000
And to invoke that, you point that at a configuration file.

445
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,520
And in the configuration file, you specify the paths to your artwork and show notes in

446
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,960
markdown and what the episode number is and all of that sort of thing.

447
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,800
And it supports string interpolation.

448
00:21:53,800 --> 00:22:00,520
So you can define some sort of like global variables, if you like, in the configuration.

449
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,320
And then they'll be inherited into the various, yeah, exactly like, yes.

450
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,280
What does it assume is on the other end receiving this information?

451
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:15,720
At the moment, it will, for the encoding process, it'll encode to OGG and MP3 and MKV, which

452
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,320
is H264 with AAC audio.

453
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:26,840
And the MKVs are specifically designed to go into YouTube with little to no reencoding

454
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
on YouTube.

455
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
That is nice.

456
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,840
Good idea.

457
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,840
So in terms of the...

458
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
Yeah, go ahead.

459
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:41,360
And in terms of the publishing, it will publish to SSH or SFDP using just about every authentication

460
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,480
mechanism you can muster.

461
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:51,200
And it will also publish to WordPress, it assumes PowerPress at the moment as the only

462
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
backend.

463
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,000
In fact, actually, it doesn't assume any backend at the moment, it'll publish to WordPress

464
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,960
and also upload to YouTube.

465
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,440
You can define in the configuration which of those you have enabled or not.

466
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,780
So at the moment, the Ubuntu podcast YouTube channel is banned for the second time.

467
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:14,320
So we have that feature disabled in our configuration file right now.

468
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,240
How does that happen?

469
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,560
How do we get banned?

470
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,560
Yeah.

471
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:25,200
Because we've got out of copyright theme music from 1927 that somebody claims is in copyright.

472
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
Oh, here's the thing.

473
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,320
That literally happens to me three, four times a day.

474
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,440
So I don't understand why you got it.

475
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,280
Yeah, it's a long, it's a long, tedious story.

476
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,680
We uploaded a load of stuff at the end of last year.

477
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,760
We basically uploaded the whole back catalog of every of the previous eight years.

478
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,240
That'll do it.

479
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,040
Yeah, and that and we got community strikes for that and then got banned.

480
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Yeah.

481
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,200
Yeah, it doesn't take much.

482
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,880
Then we persuaded them that we've been ignorant, but not malicious.

483
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,040
So we were unbanned.

484
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,640
But then we'd got a couple of strikes remaining on a few podcasts, you know, a few episodes.

485
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,560
So I filed an appeal against one and it was successful.

486
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,900
So I thought, brilliant, I'll just do the same appeal against the other seven.

487
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,200
And then we got banned again, because you're not allowed to appeal more than one at a time.

488
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,440
Yeah, isn't that a great system?

489
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
Wow.

490
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,280
And legitimately, I have, I have thought about on, you know, just sort of principle getting

491
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,000
off of YouTube.

492
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,400
But it really is, it really is a good platform for so many people.

493
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,680
Like I just asked him on the Linux action show on Sunday, hey, you know, give me a comment

494
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,680
if you watch the this entire show on YouTube, because it's not common for people to watch

495
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,360
long shows, lots of comments from people saying they did.

496
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,880
You know, I watched the entire show also, if you're on YouTube, thumbs up this video

497
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,880
right here.

498
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
Do it.

499
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,040
If you if you listen or watch the entire Linux unplugged on YouTube, give it a thumbs up

500
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,920
because what I want to demonstrate is there are a huge amount of Linux users that and

501
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:58,040
there's lots of reasons I hear work blocks RSS feeds like feedburner.

502
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,160
Oh, that's a common one that I hear is work blocks x and the only way I can get around

503
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,680
it is I use YouTube DL or something like this to pull your show down the playlists or whatever.

504
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
Yep.

505
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,640
So there's a there's a huge percentage of people that have like deals for YouTube.

506
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,840
Like if they watch YouTube, they get a they get it for free or they get a deal or doesn't

507
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,640
count against their cap or even for ISPs.

508
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,640
And so that's so there's a lot of reasons to be on YouTube.

509
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,880
Makes it really easy to do Chromecast, that kind of stuff.

510
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
Yeah.

511
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,160
So I feel you wimpy.

512
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,680
I'm curious about this stuff.

513
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,640
How from just from the Python angle from like, you know, like for the virtual env or pip

514
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,360
requirements, how is the snappy packaging gone?

515
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,800
That was actually quite straightforward.

516
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:48,920
The only complexity with snapping that application was originally the in snaps, you can stage

517
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:54,640
packages and that means pull in a deb and put that in my snap because I want to use

518
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,660
it or things that are in it and I originally staged FFmpeg and that didn't work.

519
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:06,000
But now snaps have got they originally called wiki parts and I think they might be called

520
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:15,360
online parts now, but a way of pulling in an existing snap source part into your snap.

521
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:22,380
So now the pod publish snap actually builds FFmpeg in the specific way that's required

522
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,480
by pod publish within the snap.

523
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,480
So it's got its own special version of FFmpeg integrated within it.

524
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,480
That's very interesting.

525
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,360
So that was the only on the only sort of caveat, but it works quite well.

526
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,440
It works better that way, actually, because you can, you know, customize it just enable

527
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,600
those codecs that you need and keep the size of that FFmpeg implementation minimal.

528
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
Yeah.

529
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,080
OK, so what when you hear something I think we haven't figured out yet with snaps and

530
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,720
it's probably going to be true with all the other universal application installers that

531
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,640
may or may not come to fruition.

532
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,680
There's there's no there's no contract.

533
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,960
There's no there's no guarantee on updates.

534
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,640
You know, I, for example, I'll use the snap for Telegram and then very quickly discovered

535
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,040
that it's several releases behind.

536
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,120
And then I realized, oh, yeah, of course.

537
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,760
Just because I'm using a snap doesn't guarantee I'm going to get updates back to Ike's argument

538
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,440
about just using, you know, the distro's repos or package management system.

539
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,640
But Wimpy, what are your thoughts on that?

540
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,680
When you publish a snap, what is sort of the implied contract there and and what are your

541
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:33,080
intentions with something like with like Pod Publisher or other snaps you publish?

542
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:40,160
So you talked about the new version of snap earlier, 2.13, and you mentioned the refresh

543
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,600
command.

544
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,560
That is the command that will update your installed snaps.

545
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,800
But it's still incumbent upon the snap author to actually...

546
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
At the...

547
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Sorry, go on.

548
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,800
Carry on.

549
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,980
Well, I mean, that my issue appears to be that the snap the snap authors are not updating

550
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,480
their packages all the time.

551
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,640
So the issue is not so much that I don't have a mechanism to update the snap is that they

552
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
are not...

553
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,640
How will you know what the schedule is?

554
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,640
What?

555
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,640
And what is the...

556
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,640
There's no implied contract yet.

557
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,760
There's no established norm.

558
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,400
It seems like some it seems like it's just up to the whim of the...

559
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,800
Does it follow the master branch?

560
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,160
Does it follow stable releases?

561
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
Does it follow?

562
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Yeah.

563
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
Nothing at all.

564
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,960
So the version of the snap should tell you what version it's using, whether it's, you

565
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,560
know, tip of git or a git snapshot or a stable release version.

566
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:34,080
And a lot of the snap activity that took place making snap packages that took place through

567
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:41,520
the snappy playing pen initiative was lots of people making snap packages to find out

568
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:49,680
where the edge cases were where it was difficult to, you know, create a snap or impossible

569
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,680
in some cases.

570
00:28:51,680 --> 00:29:00,680
The product of that is to try and get those snap craft packages that were made adopted

571
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,320
upstream.

572
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:10,400
So the view of snaps is it's the upstreams that will actually maintain the snap packages

573
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:16,180
and they will release snap packages in accordance with their release schedules in the same way

574
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,080
that they release new tables, for example.

575
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,080
I see.

576
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,440
Like in a sense, you could have it almost integrated in with the CI systems or anything

577
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
else.

578
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
Yeah.

579
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
Yeah, you can.

580
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,920
I mean, everything in...

581
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,920
I think this is true.

582
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,640
If it's not true now, it will be.

583
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,560
Everything in the snappy playpen is actually built in Docker containers in Travis CI, for

584
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
example.

585
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:45,520
So, you know, it's quite easy to hook that stuff up.

586
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,280
I like that.

587
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,280
I have an idea for a new show, just a really simple show kicking around in the back of

588
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,960
my head that would probably be only an MP3 just because it'd just be for fun.

589
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,960
And I really like the idea of installing pod publish as a snap and then using that to publish

590
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,960
the show.

591
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,060
So that would be a totally cool workflow to just, you know, use a snap in a way that is

592
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,280
in a production workflow and something that would, you know, I just think it'd be a really

593
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,280
great experience.

594
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,640
Especially with these new updates.

595
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,240
That's where I'm kind of curious to see how snappy snap packages get deployed to enterprises.

596
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,080
That's one big thing where it's like, if we've deployed our new release, we really need to

597
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,280
roll back in the next 20 minutes.

598
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,320
And so having these kind of tools integrated in.

599
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,320
Yeah.

600
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,320
Yeah.

601
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,800
You mentioned snap revert, and that's the tool that does that now.

602
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,440
So you can manually roll back to the previous version.

603
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,320
And it doesn't just roll back the app, it also rolls back the data for that version

604
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,320
as well.

605
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,320
I see.

606
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,040
So if you've got, if you've interest in, you mean when you mean data, do you mean application

607
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,960
settings data or do you mean user data?

608
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,960
Yeah.

609
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,960
Okay.

610
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Application settings data.

611
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,960
Well, it could be both potentially.

612
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,600
It depends how that application is, you know, whatever's in the sandbox or that sort of thing.

613
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
Yeah.

614
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
Okay.

615
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Okay.

616
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,760
Wimpy, while we've got your ear, I would love to know more about what seems to be a pretty

617
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,760
neat development and kind of makes me want one of these BQM 10 tablets even more.

618
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,760
I saw it come across your Google Plus feed here.

619
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:23,200
This to me, and I'm, you know, just looking on Google Plus, but it looks like Ubuntu Mate

620
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,360
running on the BQM 10 tablet full on touch and everything.

621
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,120
But that couldn't be, that couldn't be because this is the Mate desktop and et cetera, et

622
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
cetera.

623
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,280
Yes, it is exactly that.

624
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:45,120
So like all of the best developments in Ubuntu Mate, this came from the community.

625
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,360
It came from a guy called Marius Quebec, I hope I'm pronouncing your name correctly.

626
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:56,880
And he had worked with somebody else to come up with the basic principle of how to get

627
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,280
this going.

628
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:03,820
And he posted on G Plus and I saw it and said, please document how you did this because I'd

629
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,440
be interested in taking a look.

630
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,320
So a few days later, he pings me and sends me a document on how we did it.

631
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,560
And then I looked at that and then started to think about how it could be refined a little

632
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,480
bit because, you know, that's what I do.

633
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,740
You know, when we had the first Raspberry Pi version, I took a look at that and figured

634
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:26,280
out how it could be slightly improved and the same with the power PC port and so on.

635
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,800
So I've taken a look at what Marius has done.

636
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:36,080
And essentially the way that he's done this is to take the Xenial pre-install image of

637
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:47,320
Unity 8, stick that into a CH root on the BQM 10, bind mount the relevant places, launch

638
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:55,200
Exmere and then spawn the, oh, and then what he does is he then installs the Ubuntu Mate

639
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:02,040
Core meta package over the top of the Unity 8 CH root and then spawns the Mate session

640
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,640
into that Exmere window.

641
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,400
So and it works, you know, touch works and you can rotate the screen and the screen resizes

642
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,600
and it does all the things you'd expect it to do.

643
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,440
And you know, you've got things like Firefox pre-installed, which actually work very well.

644
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:24,360
Curiously, it seems to work better than the version of Firefox that's shipped along with

645
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,360
the M10.

646
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,200
I haven't quite figured out why that can be the case, but it appears to be.

647
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,500
So because I've done the work with the Raspberry Pi images, I've got a build system for making

648
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,440
root file systems for RMHF.

649
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,360
So I've been tinkering with that so that instead of having to put the Unity 8 image on and

650
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:53,360
then install some extra stuff into it, I've made just a Mate core root file system that

651
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,840
you can just extract directly and use that directly.

652
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,140
And I'm just trying to clean up some of the rough edges and find out how to integrate

653
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,560
it a little bit more seamlessly because it requires a little bit of hackery in order

654
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:09,040
to sort of put the scaffolding up for XMirror and then run the session.

655
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,120
You have to do it all through the phablet shell and I'm trying to find a way to do it

656
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:17,480
directly on the tablet so you can just have a launcher icon, click it and it starts.

657
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,480
Here's my use...

658
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,480
Oh, go ahead.

659
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:25,800
Oh, maybe you're about to say it because I think my use case fantasy for this is not

660
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,120
so much in full on tablet mode, although that sounds useful when I need something quickly

661
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,480
and I'm on the go.

662
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,120
But to me, what feels like the real ace in the hole use case for this would be I connect

663
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:44,440
it to an HDMI hookup and a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse and now I'm using the Mate desktop

664
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:50,600
on a lower end resources machine on a large screen that has, you know, perhaps a better

665
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
response time.

666
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
But I don't know.

667
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,760
I mean, what is the use case here?

668
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,760
Because this seems...

669
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,400
It seems at first like not...

670
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,560
It seems like Ubuntu Mate is not itself lended, as you might say, to a touch environment.

671
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,440
It is not necessarily the one I think of when I think of a touch screen experience.

672
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,600
No, it's not.

673
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:14,800
I mean, you can do a surprising amount actually by touching the screen on Mate and in Mate

674
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:22,240
1.4 we added some new features so you can make the menu icon sizes and the panel icon

675
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,120
sizes much, much bigger without changing the DPI of the whole UI so you can actually make

676
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,920
those a little bit more touch friendly.

677
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,800
Honestly, myself, I would absolutely...

678
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,640
Even if there was, let's just say, a compromise in some of the usability in a touch experience,

679
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,960
if it meant it was a useful practical desktop experience and then I could have the same

680
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,840
information and the same state when I'm on the go and when I'm hooked up to a...

681
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,840
The same state.

682
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,160
That's really what it is.

683
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:55,560
If I have notes in gedit when I'm plugged into my desktop when I'm at the client's desk

684
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,120
sitting down trying to remember what it was or when I'm at work trying to remember that

685
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:04,560
great idea I had for the show, that same gedit doc is still up on the screen.

686
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:12,220
So what's important to understand here, this is not Ubuntu Mate running on the tablet instead

687
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,100
of Ubuntu Touch.

688
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,440
It's like running inside Ubuntu Touch, right?

689
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:25,800
It's running inside a CH root inside Ubuntu Touch and it's effectively like a full screen

690
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
app.

691
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:34,680
So you can still swipe in and switch to the native touch apps, but you can go back to

692
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:40,000
it as it is its desktop and it will work with Bluetooth mice and keyboards and all the rest

693
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
of it.

694
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,840
Is there a performance penalty there?

695
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
There doesn't seem to be.

696
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:52,360
It's running extremely well and because it's running in a CH root, you've got apt so you

697
00:36:52,360 --> 00:37:01,240
can apt install those applications that you want into that CH root to add the functionality

698
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:11,000
or application richness that might currently be missing from the Ubuntu Touch ecosystem.

699
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,880
All kinds of tools I could think of.

700
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
Absolutely.

701
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
Hmm.

702
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,880
That's neat.

703
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:21,880
So Wimpy, in your estimation, what's sort of the fundamental thing that made this possible?

704
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,040
Is it once you get Ubuntu on a device like this, you can sort of just build out from

705
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,040
there?

706
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,400
Was there something else that made it?

707
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,600
Was it a firmware thing?

708
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,320
What was the quote unquote enabling technology for this?

709
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,320
It's two things.

710
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,520
It's Ubuntu and Exmere.

711
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,400
Right because this is running under Exmere, isn't it?

712
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,400
Yeah.

713
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,880
The whole that whole desktop environment is rendered with Exmere.

714
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,080
And the performance is still pretty solid.

715
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,080
It's great.

716
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,080
Boy, that's...

717
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
See, that's exciting.

718
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
Mm hmm.

719
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,080
Good.

720
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,080
Well, look at that.

721
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,080
And, and it's...

722
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,680
So there's there's quite a bit of refinement to make this a thing that people can use trivially.

723
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,640
I mean, it's fairly trivial to use if you're comfortable with the shell, but at the moment,

724
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,480
you have to have a computer hooked up to the tablet in order to, you know, bootstrap it

725
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,480
all.

726
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
I see.

727
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,800
You have to have a computer around that so you can bootstrap it from the tablet directly.

728
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,840
From the tablet without an external Linux system.

729
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
Exactly.

730
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,520
That is going to be something the iPad could never do.

731
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
No, right?

732
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,520
Like that's a fundamental...

733
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,520
Yeah.

734
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,120
And it doesn't have to be, you know, Ubuntu Mate.

735
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,640
That's obviously what I'm interested in.

736
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,880
It could be Zubuntu, Lubuntu, Kubuntu, Ubuntu Unity, Ubuntu GNOME.

737
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,080
You know, all of those will do it too.

738
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Hmm.

739
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,440
Well, that sounds super awesome.

740
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,520
Now picture it, friends.

741
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,520
Picture it.

742
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,320
You take a BQ tablet like that and you combine it with a data connection from Ting.

743
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,320
Oh, I know.

744
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,320
I know.

745
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:51,920
It sounds impossible, but friends, it is possible and it just got better than ever.

746
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,080
In fact, if you go to linux.ting.com, you support the show and you get a little money

747
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,080
off your first Ting device.

748
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
Yeah, yeah.

749
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
In fact, if you...

750
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,080
You know, here's another thing.

751
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:05,480
If you bring a Ting device, something when I say a Ting device, that's just a GSM or

752
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,440
CDMA device that's compatible with Ting's network options.

753
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,040
They got a page that tells you all about that.

754
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,680
They give you a $25 credit, average first month, or actually every month if you just

755
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,680
have one device, $23.

756
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,680
What?

757
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,000
So the $25 credit is kind of a nice thing too if you already have a device.

758
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,640
But I want you to wrap your head around this.

759
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:32,920
Ting is just pay for what you use wireless, $6 for the line plus Uncle Sam's take and

760
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,920
then you just pay for what you use.

761
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,440
And the price for pay for what you use just got even better.

762
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,960
In fact, our friend Kyra is here to tell us all about it.

763
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,220
Data is now cheaper on Ting.

764
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,800
From now on, prices look like this.

765
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,400
Need more?

766
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,200
It's just $10 a gig.

767
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,960
That's what new customers pay.

768
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,840
That's what current customers pay.

769
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,840
It's simple.

770
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,840
We like simple.

771
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,040
See for yourself at ting.com slash rates.

772
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,400
You know what I hear the most though from people that switch to Ting after hearing our

773
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,400
spots?

774
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,880
Well, you wouldn't guess because I mean, I guess I do hear quite a bit OMG, I saved a

775
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,880
ton of money.

776
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,560
I can't believe I do hear that a lot, especially from folks that are small businesses.

777
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:21,440
But the surprising one is the is the stories I hear about the experiences with their customer

778
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,440
service.

779
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,640
So they have really good customer service and I get emails and tweets in a lot.

780
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,280
In fact, in fact, if you want to send those in, keep sending them and go to the general

781
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,520
comments and keep sending them in because people have been doing that.

782
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,840
I haven't really been soliciting this, but keep doing it.

783
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,480
And if you want to take a picture of the note or something that somebody from Ting sends

784
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,480
you, please do.

785
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,160
Like people are getting personalized and I'm not shitting you here.

786
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:50,600
People are getting personalized gifts from the Ting support.

787
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,980
Like little notes, little notes or like a little card or something like that.

788
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,840
And it's just it's blowing people's minds and it's, you know, it's I don't know if it's

789
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,360
something they do all the time or if it's just something they do from time to time.

790
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,520
I mean, nothing is like the Ting customer service.

791
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,840
You call them, you talk to a real human being and there's no BS.

792
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,280
They stick with you through a problem.

793
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,360
Let me tell you, I can testify to that.

794
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:13,240
The one time in over two and a half years I've used Ting, the one time I had to call

795
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,100
in was when I was doing the road trip to Noah's house and I don't know, I was in Montana or

796
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:21,600
some some crazy backward place and no offense, Montana.

797
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:26,880
And the Ting rep literally stayed on the phone with me for over an hour as we worked through

798
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,160
all kinds of bad connectivity problems with the CDMA network and none of it was Ting's

799
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,160
fault.

800
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,560
And they still stuck with me till the end to make sure it all got working.

801
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,520
They could have punted at any moment and they didn't.

802
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,880
They have tons of nice devices you can buy directly, all of them unlocked.

803
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,760
You own them outright or you can bring your own or just buy it directly from the Play

804
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,760
Store.

805
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,800
Check them out at Linux.Ting.com.

806
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,840
You want to go get a line for your tablet and only pay for the data when you have to

807
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,200
go off Wi-Fi from time to time?

808
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,200
Exactly.

809
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
Ting is a great option.

810
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,000
Linux.Ting.com.

811
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,680
So I want to just take a real quick moment to mention that the Humble Bundle Survive

812
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,840
This Bundle is out.

813
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,280
The Humble Survive This Bundle, I guess.

814
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,280
Oh, this looks great.

815
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,960
Yeah, and it is nice because they've got three actual games, which is somewhat progress.

816
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,960
Although all the ones I'm interested in, like this first one and this one that looks like

817
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:21,280
it's a Mars one, not available for Linux because apparently they hate me.

818
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,240
But there are a couple of good ones like Rust, Early Access, available for Linux.

819
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,520
I think this Colot one looks kind of interesting.

820
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,520
Tell me about it.

821
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,520
Colot?

822
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,520
Yeah, I actually haven't looked at the game.

823
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,440
I remember looking at it during the Steam sale, but it's narrated by Sean Bean.

824
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,040
It's an exploration adventure game, so you kind of have to be into more of that, like

825
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,840
a little slower paced, a little creepy, you know, kind of just going around.

826
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,220
But actually it follows this like really kind of creepy incident where a bunch of graduate

827
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,480
students died hiking this mountain.

828
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,480
Have you seen Rust?

829
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,480
Yeah, Rust looks fun too.

830
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,640
Yeah, it does.

831
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,520
And that's almost worth the price of admission right there if you don't have it already.

832
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,080
Especially it's nice to get a DRM free version.

833
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,080
It's not-

834
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,800
And when you give to the Humble Bundle, you can feel good about it.

835
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,080
Yeah, plus it's nice to see Linux stats on there.

836
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,400
Just saying, just saying.

837
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,640
But yeah, I would love to see all of the games.

838
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,640
All of the games.

839
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,800
Also, they have a discount on the Humble Monthly.

840
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:18,280
All right, I was teasing it earlier, and this is a little embarrassing to show on air because

841
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:19,400
I don't know what happened.

842
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,880
You know, Dustin, I like him.

843
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,880
You know, I've met Dustin.

844
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,360
He probably doesn't remember because it was years ago.

845
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,280
But I met him at, I think it was Ubicon or something like that.

846
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:33,120
And I just don't know about this picture of him over on linux.com.

847
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,040
It's like a picture for you, those of you listening, it's all inverted.

848
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,440
So what's black is white, and what's white is black.

849
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,340
And then they have the tux.

850
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:46,000
They have Dustin wearing a overcoat, which he either-

851
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,040
And then like a weird blue-green glowing skin tone.

852
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,760
Which he either sent them a picture of him like that, or he took it just for this, or

853
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,760
they shopped it.

854
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,280
Does it not look, just a little bit, kind of look like he might be offering you like

855
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,840
on the cheap organs in an alleyway somewhere?

856
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:07,800
In a futuristic like sci-fi post-apocalyptic like nuke war kind of movie?

857
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,800
Yes, it does.

858
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,800
New Noosepleen, sir.

859
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,520
Yes, it does.

860
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,160
So that said, he is rocking a bitchin' beard in that photo and reppin' that.

861
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,680
So pretty much, I'm not even joking, the beard makes the entire photo work, doesn't it?

862
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,680
It really does.

863
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,320
If it wasn't for that beard, that photo would suck.

864
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,680
But Tux needs a beard too.

865
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,240
Quite literally, the beard in that photo saves the rest of it because he's almost got a,

866
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,560
I mean I'm just, I'm getting wafts of Chuck Norris.

867
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,560
Yeah, you are.

868
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,160
Oh man, without the beard here, it would be very different.

869
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,520
Right, but with the beard and that jacket, I am getting wafts of Norris.

870
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,800
And then all of a sudden it's gotten my attention.

871
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,960
Oh, it also has the shitty Windows logo on there.

872
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:49,640
Anyways, if you scroll down, he talks about benchmarking Ubuntu under Windows versus Ubuntu

873
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,640
native.

874
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:57,440
And he's doing it on the Lenovo X250 with an Intel i7 5600 CPU, 16 gigabytes of random

875
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:06,600
access memory, and 512 gigabytes of transcend SSD and a two terabyte Samsung SSD.

876
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,800
So this is, in perhaps the kid's parlance, a hell of a machine.

877
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,340
And he's using sysbench for a lot of these, and what's nice is he just gives you the commands

878
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,340
to reproduce.

879
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,340
Yeah, it is really nice.

880
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,760
Yeah, you can just go on your machine and do this yourself.

881
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,440
Anyways, he had some interesting tests.

882
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:28,200
He wanted to nail the CPU, he wanted to check disk I.O., network performance, and of course

883
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,920
you've got to do the classic, he built the Linux kernel.

884
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,300
You've got to do that, that's required.

885
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:39,080
And so when he starts with the CPU benchmark, he said that he saw almost identical results

886
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,040
between Ubuntu native and Ubuntu under Windows.

887
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,480
It took basically 2.8 seconds to run 10,000 CPU instructions.

888
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,440
Not bad.

889
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,800
But I want to move on to the memory benchmark, because this is where things got interesting.

890
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,680
So he's going to move 100 gigabytes of data through memory.

891
00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:03,300
Native Ubuntu was able to move data through memory at 4,235 megabytes a second.

892
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:09,720
Ubuntu on Windows was able to do it at 2,309 megabytes a second, so two gigabytes versus

893
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,480
four gigabytes.

894
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,360
That's a second, that's a huge difference.

895
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,680
This difference exposes a bit, not only the difference in I.O. performance between the

896
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:23,800
two systems, but also the overhead involved with Ubuntu under Windows.

897
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,000
So then another interesting look here was disk performance.

898
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:34,420
He says we're writing one gig file with just nothing but zeros synchroously to the disk.

899
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:40,560
Native Ubuntu yields about 147 megabytes average write speed to the disk.

900
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:47,020
Ubuntu under Windows manages to get 248 megabytes.

901
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:54,320
So a difference of 147 under native Ubuntu, 248 megabytes under Windows.

902
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,520
A massive difference!

903
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,520
How is this possible?

904
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,440
Well, it's a bit of trickery on Windows.

905
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:02,800
The flag that we're sending the DD command, the desync command, which is supposed to guarantee

906
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,120
synchronous writes to disk, ensuring that every single byte is in fact written to disk

907
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,540
and not cached in a buffer memory, you know, kind of cheating the throughput.

908
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:16,500
That same flag was used on both the Windows and the Ubuntu machines, but it seems the

909
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,760
implementation of Ubuntu under Windows does not yet quite support that.

910
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,880
And you got to wonder about that, like in how many cases they're like, you know, there's

911
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,120
a lot of stuff, things to implement in that layer.

912
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,740
So it makes sense that not everything is bit perfect.

913
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,920
And yeah, and that's a there's a big translation probably happening there.

914
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,160
Network throughput, specifically testing TCP bandwidth using IP perf.

915
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:43,480
The native Ubuntu machine averaged 935 megabits, while Ubuntu on Windows an average of 805

916
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,480
megabits.

917
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,700
A noticeable reduction there.

918
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,400
But the one we've all been waiting for, the Linux kernel compilation test.

919
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:57,440
The native Ubuntu build took five minutes, 38 seconds, while Ubuntu on Windows took eight

920
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,240
minutes and 47 seconds.

921
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,680
I don't want to wait that long.

922
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,680
No, no.

923
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,720
It's suggested, by the way, this is, remember, I mentioned this earlier.

924
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,160
So Dustin contacted some folks at Microsoft, and you know what their response was?

925
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,160
What?

926
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:23,960
I know we turn this on by default, but you might want to disable Windows Defender.

927
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:24,960
No way.

928
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,960
Yeah.

929
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,960
Yeah.

930
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:27,960
Yeah.

931
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,960
Really?

932
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,960
Wow.

933
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,960
Yeah.

934
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,960
So now he didn't have time to try it.

935
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,920
But that does that seems to be anyone else.

936
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,920
If anyone has a has this redstone.

937
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,920
Yeah.

938
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:37,920
They could try it.

939
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,920
Stuff built in.

940
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,920
Yeah.

941
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,920
Get back to us about it.

942
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:44,680
So he concludes from a performance perspective, CPU and network bound processes will perform

943
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:49,760
nearly identical in Ubuntu on Windows as native Ubuntu on bare metal would.

944
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:56,080
For heavily cached disk IO operations, Ubuntu on Windows might even outperform native Ubuntu

945
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,880
on bare metal.

946
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:02,240
But for heavily randomized reads and writes and memory heavy operations, Ubuntu on Windows

947
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,400
does introduce a bit of overhead that might be noticeable in some workloads.

948
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,400
Pretty cool test.

949
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,160
It is kind of an interesting, even though you introduced this translation layer, it's

950
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,640
kind of an interesting way now where you can benchmark a Windows system or a Linux system

951
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:22,360
and then use the very same tool regardless of it actually supports Windows or not and

952
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,360
run the same benchmark.

953
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,360
So that's kind of interesting.

954
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,360
Yeah.

955
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:30,600
And, you know, it really does also speak to the to the rather awesome technical implementation

956
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,280
that the Windows subsystem folks have done here.

957
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,000
I mean, that's pretty impressive.

958
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,120
It's damn near a wine quality, you might say.

959
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,320
Also it's probably a lot easier now you have Windows you want to I mean, you want to install

960
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:45,600
Linux, but you're kind of a purist and you want your own custom compiled kernel.

961
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,640
Makes it a lot easier to do that, too.

962
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,120
I want to continue to follow with like a remote distance.

963
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,560
Like I'm not going to install Windows 10 and try it.

964
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,560
Right.

965
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,560
We're not hosting the show from Linux.

966
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,080
No, I'm not that motivated.

967
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:01,400
But I will watch as things drive by me and I'll go, oh, that's interesting.

968
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,400
OK, I'll note that.

969
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,120
I do see a lot of excitement from like the people who use Linux professionally because

970
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,980
they have to deploy to servers, but like aren't they're not they're not watching the show.

971
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,360
They're not Linux enthusiasts.

972
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,520
And there seems to be a lot of excitement there, just like, oh, I don't have to use

973
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:15,520
a Mac.

974
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,520
It's a nice feature.

975
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,520
I don't have to install Cygwin.

976
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,520
Yeah.

977
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:21,160
You know, Rekai, editor of the show, and much more.

978
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,920
The beard ended up breaking down and taking advantage of the free upgrade.

979
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:24,920
I understand.

980
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,920
I understand Rekai.

981
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,120
I only slightly judge you.

982
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,920
And he went ahead and installed the Ubuntu subsystem.

983
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:39,760
And you know, it is the only the only thing I can the only way I can describe it as is

984
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,140
it's unnerving.

985
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:45,800
It's unnerving to all of a sudden see him using Linux commands in what is clearly a

986
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:46,800
Windows box.

987
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:47,800
See, that is weird.

988
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,560
It's like, oh, that's not LS.

989
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,560
That's not right.

990
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,560
You mean dir.

991
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:53,560
Yeah.

992
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:54,560
You mean dir.

993
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,880
Wimpy, can we go back to full bandwidth here for a second, full spectrum wireless bandwidth?

994
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,000
And can you chime in a little bit for the folks over here in the US that might not have

995
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,320
heard about it or those that missed out on what the heck FOSStalk is and how the hell

996
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,320
it went?

997
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:14,120
Because I listened to the Ubuntu podcast and it sounded like a pretty fun event.

998
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:20,820
Yeah, so FOSStalk, it was the first event.

999
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:24,680
It was organized by Joe Ressington from the Linux Luddites.

1000
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:30,240
I happen to know Joe is trying to fall asleep at the moment with one earphone plugged in.

1001
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,600
So if you can just pan me left to right a few times, I know that'll irritate him insanely

1002
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,840
and wake him up.

1003
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,760
So yeah, Joe Joe organized the event.

1004
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,720
It was this Saturday just gone.

1005
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:46,520
It was a small, small event.

1006
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:53,640
Joe wanted to make sure that, you know, it was small enough that if lots of people didn't

1007
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:58,400
turn up who'd said they were going to turn up, it wouldn't look, you know, like it was

1008
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,400
a complete disaster.

1009
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:03,640
As it turns out, I think pretty much everyone that requested a ticket turned up.

1010
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,880
So there's about 50 people at this event.

1011
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,240
It was at a pub in London.

1012
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:17,080
So it was a gastro pub, so good food, good beer on the ground floor.

1013
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:23,800
There was a small hotel above it and then a basement venue where the event itself took

1014
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,600
place.

1015
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:30,640
And we had the Linux Luddites do a 45 minute show.

1016
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:35,760
The Aventive Podcast, we did one, and then Linux Voice did a podcast.

1017
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:42,000
And then there was what was billed as the drunken mashup as the last show of the evening,

1018
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:49,320
which was Joe and Stuart Langridge and Dave Meckerslippers from Geek News Radio, and a

1019
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:55,040
lot of heckling from the audience by that time of night with the intake of beverages.

1020
00:52:55,040 --> 00:53:01,400
So yeah, four 45 minute podcasts with a half hour in between, an hour and a half or so

1021
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:06,840
beforehand for drinks and chatting, and then late night drinking at another venue around

1022
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,840
the corner afterwards.

1023
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:17,200
So it was basically a big social gathering with some podcasts going on to keep people

1024
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,200
entertained.

1025
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,760
That that's a nice way to describe it.

1026
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,760
I like that atmosphere.

1027
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:26,560
You know, it makes me want to I just I want to go like, let's do this here in the States.

1028
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:31,120
Let's figure out a time after scale or some some other Linux fest or something like that.

1029
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,800
And let's just do one of these here because that's oh, man, that seems cool.

1030
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,800
Yeah.

1031
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,120
I wish you guys would have streamed it live.

1032
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,120
If I could.

1033
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,120
I would have watched that.

1034
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,120
Yeah.

1035
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,120
Or even listen.

1036
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,480
I listen to I know that but you actually overall the audio turned out pretty good.

1037
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,400
So I got to give Joe Joe knows what he's doing.

1038
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,640
I was Joe's roadie.

1039
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,440
So he just pointed at cables and told me what to do and I got on with it.

1040
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:58,320
But yeah, I think I think the idea was to keep it as simple as possible this first time

1041
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,080
round.

1042
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:03,600
And yeah, and maybe there'll be another event.

1043
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,640
I think the aspiration is definitely for there to be another one or this is the first of

1044
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:14,240
many who knows the life the scope and scale will increase over time good, good approach

1045
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:19,600
really very good approach because there's nothing like doing a live performance doing

1046
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:24,480
it doing something that you normally have recorded in a in a setting where you're comfortable

1047
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,600
you have everything you need your notes, you have time to collect your thoughts.

1048
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,480
You're often in a room by yourself when you're podcasting right.

1049
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,320
And to take what has been and you do that for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and

1050
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,680
weeks and weeks and weeks sometimes years and years and years and all of a sudden you

1051
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,760
do it in the same room with people.

1052
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,320
So not only you not normally record looking at these people, but there's also a whole

1053
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:51,120
bunch of other people there that are looking at you and you're always performing the performance

1054
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,120
never stops.

1055
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,640
I know downtown and there's nobody there.

1056
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:55,640
Right.

1057
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,080
There's no editing out that pause.

1058
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,880
So what was that like for you, Wimpy?

1059
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,880
It was good fun.

1060
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:01,880
Yeah.

1061
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,880
Yeah.

1062
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,880
Yeah.

1063
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,640
Joe Joe's actually telegramming me as we're talking he said that someone said to him that

1064
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:12,580
that Fostalk was like the best bits of odd camp, but in one evening, which is a glowing

1065
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:17,440
endorsement and it really was it was basically a condensed version of the social track of

1066
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,840
odd camp with many of the odd campers in attendance.

1067
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:26,840
Not all of them because it was obviously in London and all campus typically in the north

1068
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,840
of England.

1069
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,320
So we didn't have the full spread.

1070
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,760
But yeah, the event venue is very small.

1071
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:40,400
So we were only about three or four feet from the front row of the audience so you can see

1072
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:46,360
the whites of people's eyes and you you could very definitely tell whether or not things

1073
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,280
are going going well or not.

1074
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,800
Thankfully it seems to go well just like with music where it's like it's a whole different

1075
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,760
thing for the performer but also for the audience that kind of live interaction you really feel

1076
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,440
much more close much more engaged with the presenter.

1077
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,240
Basically you never live up to what people expect by listening to you.

1078
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,800
It's just it's it's a winning it's a never winning thing it's.

1079
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,280
So there's that initial awkward moment where they know you they have heard you they know

1080
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:16,120
how you think how you talk and you have no idea who they are and it's it's it is funny

1081
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:22,960
because I have I have entered I have I developed a response.

1082
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,780
So when people like every now and then I'm out shopping it does happen where I'll run

1083
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:32,040
into a listener and so people go Chris and and what do you do when somebody if somebody

1084
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:35,320
walk to me go Wes you know you don't have a right.

1085
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,320
What do you say.

1086
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,560
My initial response is that's me.

1087
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,680
And so when I started dating Hadeah she noticed that this is how it happens and that's that's

1088
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:43,680
me.

1089
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,800
So she makes fun of me every time it happens right.

1090
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,240
And because people walk up to you and they're like oh I know you and I have no idea what

1091
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,360
your name is so and you don't know if it's like someone you should know or if it's someone

1092
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:56,680
you've never met or but at the same time then all of a sudden you get to put a face to like

1093
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:59,640
an IRC name or like an email address.

1094
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:04,240
Yeah so I say yeah there was there was lots of that lots of people introducing themselves

1095
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,320
and saying it's good to put a face to the name.

1096
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:15,000
And also lots of people very generously buying all of the podcasters beers Joe rather rather

1097
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,640
optimistically had a large bucket in which to collect money to buy beers for the podcasters

1098
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,040
and people were extraordinarily generous.

1099
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:30,360
So yes my headache the following morning reflected people's generosity in that regard.

1100
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,240
So I just have one last question and Poby's not here.

1101
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:37,160
So I want the full real story.

1102
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:42,640
What was the deal with the laminated show notes?

1103
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:51,560
So the Ubuntu podcast has a reputation for being very well organized.

1104
00:57:51,560 --> 00:58:01,000
And in particular Graham from Linux voice finds this a point of much irritation.

1105
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,480
So the laminating of the show notes was really.

1106
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,480
And the passing of the biscuits.

1107
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,480
Really just to wind up Graham.

1108
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,480
Yeah.

1109
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,480
That was pretty good.

1110
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,480
That was.

1111
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,480
Yeah.

1112
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,720
That was good.

1113
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,240
Now laminated show notes is I almost want to.

1114
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,240
We'll have to copy that.

1115
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,080
I almost want to continue that tradition because it's so brilliant.

1116
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,560
I think it's a good reference.

1117
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,560
You know it's right on top.

1118
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:22,560
It's great.

1119
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,560
Yeah.

1120
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,560
Yeah you could.

1121
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,720
It worked really well actually because we knew we had 45 minutes and so on our on our

1122
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:38,200
show notes we had the times as you know at 7.30 7.33 you know the bits that we were doing

1123
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,000
and we actually stuck to time perfectly.

1124
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,760
So it worked out really well in the end.

1125
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,960
Well it sounds like a fun event and if we ever get a few of you over here in the US

1126
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,800
at one time we've got to.

1127
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,800
Yeah it was.

1128
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:56,280
So if anyone isn't hasn't heard so you can go to the current episode of Linux Luddites.

1129
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,000
They've got their live recording published now.

1130
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,360
The current episode it's episode twenty three and a half of the Ubuntu podcast is just the

1131
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,040
live recording from Fostalk.

1132
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:11,840
I don't know if Linux Voice are going to be recording their live recording because there

1133
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:17,320
was a fair amount of beer had been consumed by that point in the evening but I think Joe

1134
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:24,280
is planning to release the Drunken Mashup show as soon as he gets his domain whitelisted

1135
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,280
with PodTrack.

1136
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,640
So I think definitely three of the shows are going to be.

1137
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:35,400
If you're listening at home I think the order to listen to would be Luddites 84 then the

1138
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,880
Ubuntu podcast then Linux Voice if they get it out right.

1139
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,520
That's if you want to order the night.

1140
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:48,120
Yeah yeah so it's Linux Luddites, Ubuntu podcast, Linux Voice and then the mashup.

1141
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,120
Love it.

1142
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:50,120
Well that sounds like a fun event.

1143
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,120
Yeah it really does.

1144
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:52,120
And I think it really was.

1145
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:55,160
Maybe we could see the laminated show notes traditionally continue on.

1146
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:59,000
And thanks to Joe for organizing it because it's a new event in our schedule now and it

1147
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
was a lot of fun.

1148
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,400
How come we don't do more like that Wes?

1149
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,400
We need that.

1150
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,400
We're going to.

1151
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,400
Yep.

1152
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,400
Absolutely.

1153
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,400
We'll figure that out.

1154
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,400
We're resolved.

1155
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,400
Janice!

1156
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,400
Janice would you get on that?

1157
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,400
Get right on that.

1158
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,680
I just want to talk about SSH hacks.

1159
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,680
We got to move in.

1160
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,880
That was the community updates and there's a hell of a lot of them it's good stuff too

1161
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,280
so thank you everybody.

1162
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:20,760
Let's get ready for the next segment by mentioning DigitalOcean.

1163
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:26,000
Now this a lot of what we're about to talk about you could easily try out on DigitalOcean.

1164
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,720
Simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to getting it your whole system up and running

1165
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,720
in no time.

1166
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,700
Really simple straightforward and intuitive.

1167
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,200
Great UI to manage it all.

1168
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:39,520
You can get a system spun up in less than 55 seconds and for about five dollars a month

1169
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,720
you can run a system with 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte

1170
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,720
of transfer.

1171
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,260
I say about because I actually would look at DigitalOcean more like in the hourly context.

1172
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:52,880
If you go over to their pricing switch over to the hourly button there and then you can

1173
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,220
really see how this rocks.

1174
01:00:54,220 --> 01:01:01,240
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED DOUNPLUGGED all one word lowercase.

1175
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:05,500
You smash it together you put it in there you apply it and they'll give you a $10 credit.

1176
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:09,120
Now here's what I did this morning just to give you an example of how handy this is.

1177
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:15,360
I wanted to try out a local wiki and I don't really want to learn docu wiki syntax although

1178
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:20,300
I might just end up doing that but I wanted to try out I think it's MD wiki it's markdown

1179
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:24,160
wiki because I use markdown every single day for our show notes and I thought well wouldn't

1180
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,480
it be great if my wiki was marked down.

1181
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:31,080
Oh here we go and so I looked at MD wiki which apparently has been updated for 20 by since

1182
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,320
2014 but I thought I don't care.

1183
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,880
If I use this I'm gonna put it on my own local LAN.

1184
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:41,600
So I could live with that but I'll be honest with you I didn't feel like installing Apache

1185
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,760
on my system and setting up PHP.

1186
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:48,760
I just I have better things to do but I want to try don't set up PHP just don't do it don't

1187
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:49,760
do it.

1188
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,760
I know right.

1189
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:54,440
I have better things to do and I just don't want to chunk up my system but I wanted to

1190
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:59,920
see if MD wiki was a viable solution because if it is I will set it up on a home server

1191
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,640
that's on my LAN for my notes about things like warranty information about appliances

1192
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:09,840
or you know the model of surge protector I got for this or that you know these kinds

1193
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:13,640
of stupid things that you kind of want to keep track of especially when you're in warranty

1194
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:14,640
stuff.

1195
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:17,360
But you don't want to keep the papers around you don't want to keep anything like that.

1196
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:22,800
So I thought okay MD wiki it is so instead of junking up my system in just seconds I

1197
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:30,580
spun up a San Francisco based droplet with Ubuntu 14.04 Apache MySQL and PHP all good

1198
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,580
to go.

1199
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:35,960
So I log in I change my root password first time I log in I change my root password right

1200
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:41,320
there in the message of the day it tells me this is my web directory.

1201
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:43,520
Drop your HTML files in here.

1202
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,960
This is the oil to go to.

1203
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,160
This is your info dot PHP if you want to see what your PHP install can do.

1204
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:50,760
I mean I love that.

1205
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:58,800
I up I FCP up the MD dot wiki dot HTML file and I mean within two minutes and 45 seconds

1206
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:02,600
I was able to determine that MD wiki was a total waste of my time.

1207
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,600
Like it just sucks.

1208
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,240
It doesn't render properly.

1209
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,080
It hasn't been updated for years.

1210
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:11,200
It was a and you know what I immediately destroyed the drop.

1211
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,720
I just like kill it.

1212
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:13,720
One API call away.

1213
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,000
Did I even pay a penny for that.

1214
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,080
I don't know.

1215
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:19,600
That's why if you use the promo code deal unplugged this is just a scenario where you

1216
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,760
apply a ten dollar credit to your account and leave it in there and when you want to

1217
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:28,640
try something like this you I deployed the entire stack uploaded the file and determined

1218
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,960
that it was a garbage project.

1219
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:33,480
Now within minutes I didn't have to junk up my local host.

1220
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,480
I could have installed all of that stuff on my Linux box but I don't really I don't want

1221
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,000
Apache installed on my Linux box.

1222
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,360
You don't need it and that's why it's great to get that.

1223
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,920
So even if you if you want to try out the five dollar machine and run it two months

1224
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,460
for free that's awesome.

1225
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:50,520
But if you just want to apply the credit you can try out like they're super powerful machines

1226
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:51,760
just for minutes.

1227
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,200
Try them create something and then destroy them.

1228
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,240
And if you want to end up.

1229
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:58,800
And here's the other thing like if I was trying something other than empty wiki because I

1230
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:03,000
would always run that locally but if I was trying something else and it worked fine then

1231
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I'm done.

1232
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
It's in production.

1233
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,880
It's on a production grade system.

1234
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:07,880
It's ready to go.

1235
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:08,880
Bam.

1236
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,520
You have backups you have snapshots whatever you need.

1237
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:14,160
Yeah and they have an API that makes it super easy to interact with open source apps that

1238
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,160
have already been written.

1239
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,160
So check it out.

1240
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,160
Use the promo code D.O.

1241
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:22,560
Unplugged and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring you know they got a they got

1242
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,520
a brand new fancy looking website.

1243
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:25,880
I was about to comment on that.

1244
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,880
It's nice right.

1245
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:27,880
Yeah.

1246
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:28,880
Nice and clean.

1247
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:29,880
All right.

1248
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,540
So we're going to talk about SSH hacks and I definitely want to hear from our virtual

1249
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:35,360
lug on their hacks but you know tricks.

1250
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:41,080
But we should start by mentioning that open SSH version 7.3 was released recently.

1251
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:44,720
And it has a feature that I want to talk about kind of right off the top before we get into

1252
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,340
this thing because this is so cool.

1253
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:53,360
It added some new features to the proxy jump option proxy jump a command line flag to allow

1254
01:04:53,360 --> 01:05:00,480
simplified indirection through one or more SSH base stations or jump hosts.

1255
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,920
So we have an article linked in the show notes how to use a jump host in your SSH client

1256
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,080
configurations.

1257
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:13,240
So my having never actually surprisingly use this and it seems really useful very useful.

1258
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:18,360
But my understanding is I SSH to one machine which then proxies my SSH connection to an

1259
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,100
entirely separate machine.

1260
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:24,280
And maybe I do this because I could have SSH running on host a on some crazy like port

1261
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:28,200
four four three kind of config and then it could connect to my actual client.

1262
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:32,760
Well it's also if you're part of like a larger enterprise or like I'm sure I know border

1263
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:33,760
SSH server.

1264
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,760
Yeah.

1265
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,760
OK.

1266
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:36,760
These are the things.

1267
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,720
And a lot of in the past a lot of people use net cat or other things to like proxy the

1268
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,760
ports between these.

1269
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,200
But for a while now SSH has supported this directly.

1270
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:45,560
They have the capital W command here which takes care of it for you so you don't need

1271
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:49,980
to evoke any other third party system as you can do it all itself.

1272
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:54,760
So this is just the like tip of the iceberg of stuff that you don't even think about when

1273
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:01,600
you when I don't want to think about SSH and we have like a whole line of of SSH type tricks.

1274
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:05,120
But there's one I wanted to kind of talk about that you've installed earlier today that's

1275
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,080
sort of the opposite of this stuff.

1276
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:11,920
It's it's really for fun or maybe even for a little bit of research on your own and it's

1277
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:15,320
called cow wire or co wire.

1278
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,600
I guess it's cow or I don't know co wire.

1279
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,560
I like cow wire because I like it.

1280
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,680
I like the idea of like a trip wire.

1281
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,680
That's right.

1282
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,680
But I think it's a co wire.

1283
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,800
Let's go with co wire.

1284
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:26,800
It's co wire.

1285
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,800
I love it.

1286
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:33,360
And it's an SSH honeypot that Wes has set up on one of his servers for us to talk about

1287
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,360
here.

1288
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,680
Yeah I love this.

1289
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,680
And I'm kind of curious you've had it going for a couple of hours.

1290
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,680
Yeah that's true.

1291
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:41,680
Let's go look.

1292
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:42,680
Yeah.

1293
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:46,480
So let me tell folks what co wire does is it's an SSH honeypot designed to log brute

1294
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,760
force attacks and shell interactions performed by the attacker.

1295
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,760
Here's some of the interesting features.

1296
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,760
You ready for this.

1297
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:58,080
It creates a fake file system with the ability to add remove files a full fake file system

1298
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:02,880
resembling resembling I'm sorry a Debian 5.0 install.

1299
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:03,880
How wonderful is that.

1300
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:04,880
Nice and secure.

1301
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:05,880
Yeah.

1302
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:09,320
You have the possibility of adding fake file content so the attacker can cat files such

1303
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,160
as Etsy password.

1304
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,480
Only minimal file contents are included by the default.

1305
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:20,120
Open logs are stored in a UML compatible format for easy replay and co wire saves the file

1306
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:29,160
downloads with wget and curl or uploaded with SFTP and SSCP for later inspection.

1307
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:33,960
So you if they if they if they transmit something up to the box it stores it away for you to

1308
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,040
look at later.

1309
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,040
Which is great.

1310
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,040
What are they trying to do.

1311
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:38,040
Mm hmm.

1312
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:39,040
It's a honeypot.

1313
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,680
Yeah it's it's a very easy to set up honeypot.

1314
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,680
How easy was it to set up.

1315
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:45,720
I think they might need I'll see about maybe sending them some pull requests.

1316
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:49,680
There's a couple dependency things that maybe need to be update updated or on like at least

1317
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,360
on they had some instructions for Debian at least with 16 or four there's a few things

1318
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:57,840
like their PIP requirements were slightly off but I mean no more than like 10 minutes

1319
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,320
of once you've got the Python dependencies installed they have a very nice start and

1320
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:05,560
stop set of bash scripts for you that you can specify even like a virtual environment

1321
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:09,280
for you to use that so you don't have to set up anything like that.

1322
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,520
So I thought it was pretty easy to get going.

1323
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:14,760
I do recommend that you have a non root user that you run this as because all of the SSH

1324
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,560
sessions will be in that user's name.

1325
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,560
Oh yes.

1326
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,560
Is that what you did.

1327
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:19,560
Yes.

1328
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,560
So do you.

1329
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:21,560
So OK.

1330
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:28,760
So could we give the live stream a URL SSH into I mean an address SSH into but they would

1331
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:34,800
they would have to know the I mean so essentially it's a it's a honeypot they could bang on and

1332
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,120
then we could watch what they do.

1333
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:40,680
It does legitimately have like a username and password they would have to know like

1334
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:43,520
there they'd actually have to be able to hack it right.

1335
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:48,880
Well you can configure that so that actually that's sorry no that's exactly that that's

1336
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,720
exactly the point of a honeypot.

1337
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:54,960
You don't just give direct access you need to make it you know challenging so that it

1338
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:55,960
seems real.

1339
01:08:55,960 --> 01:09:00,400
The first right yeah for yeah for legitimate honeypot but if we want to let the audience

1340
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,640
bang on it and so it actually starts out the way this one's configured as it denies them

1341
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:09,640
the earliest the default config they ship with it denies the two most common root passwords

1342
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,520
which is one is just root and the other is like ABC one two three or something like that

1343
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,500
or one two three four five six I think is what it is.

1344
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:17,500
It denies those two.

1345
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:22,360
But right now it's configured so that pretty much any password and any user name you want

1346
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,680
to put the host name in the chat room we'll see if people want to hack away.

1347
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:28,260
And then it's so I have up on this screen over here is this the is this the correct

1348
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:29,260
log file.

1349
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:30,260
It looks like it.

1350
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:32,200
So you would have maybe refresh it right now though.

1351
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,800
OK what have you used to generate this live log file that I'm looking at here.

1352
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:40,480
That is SOCAT and tail dash F. There are some better there are some fancier ones that like

1353
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,080
WebSocket D is kind of like a Unix philosophy style WebSocket thing.

1354
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,780
It just takes a little bit of JavaScript on the client side to get you to render it.

1355
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:50,820
So in the future I'd like to have a better prepared live log file.

1356
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:54,080
But here is a very hacky.

1357
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,480
So we put it in there.

1358
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,480
It's a wasp nest.

1359
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,480
Is that what it is.

1360
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:58,480
Wasp nest.

1361
01:09:58,480 --> 01:09:59,480
Yep.

1362
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,480
That noble pain dot com.

1363
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:04,160
I'm seeing some incoming connections right now coming into your system West.

1364
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:07,000
I'm going to zoom in on the text so we can we can see it.

1365
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,320
So if in theory would we see what they do on the file system go to the log here or we

1366
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,320
just seeing their connection.

1367
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,400
You know and it does at least like it logs.

1368
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,480
It doesn't necessarily log all the output seemingly but it does log and they have a

1369
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,960
separate audit log I can show too.

1370
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,200
It does log all of the commands that people try to run.

1371
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,280
So it'll say like like it and it denies some.

1372
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:29,580
So like if config IP it won't let you run but like it'll it'll show you when it finds

1373
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:31,440
curls w gets that kind of stuff.

1374
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,920
I know I would instead of it so I won't show people's IPs on the screen but I see people

1375
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,640
like honey Alex I see trying to log in right now.

1376
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,440
This is interesting.

1377
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:44,320
New keys looks like I don't see if anybody's gotten access yet to you.

1378
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,400
I see authorization failed.

1379
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,640
This is really should have.

1380
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:52,920
So if you I mean I think even with a blank password you should be able to get in.

1381
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:53,920
That's easy to act.

1382
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,120
Actually maybe these people are connecting here because I don't see failed logins for

1383
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,120
these ones.

1384
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,120
Oh here we go.

1385
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,120
Oh boy.

1386
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,920
So we got some we got some activity happening now.

1387
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,720
We got some Python scripts running.

1388
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,760
This is this is getting so this is going south real fast.

1389
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,800
Oh my gosh Wes.

1390
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,200
Oh I don't know if this is a good idea after all.

1391
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:11,200
But this is pretty fun to watch.

1392
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:14,760
It is pretty fun to watch because we get to we get to watch from like this sort of like

1393
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:17,220
admin perspective and watch people go crazy.

1394
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:22,920
This is kind of a fun real easy or I mean relatively easy to set up honeypot co wire

1395
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:26,840
will have a link in the show notes if you guys want to check it out.

1396
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:27,840
That's pretty neat.

1397
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:28,840
Are you watching this.

1398
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,840
That's pretty fun.

1399
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,960
So in the future I'd like to have a live log that like scrolled as you update right now.

1400
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:33,960
Yeah.

1401
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:34,960
Keep scrolling.

1402
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:35,960
Yeah.

1403
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:36,960
But that's still some people.

1404
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,880
It's surprising how many people can't log in and is command not found L.S. you don't

1405
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,200
have L.S. on this thing.

1406
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,200
That is weird.

1407
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,200
I think it should.

1408
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:46,960
I mean when when I it's interesting I can see what commands are attempting to run.

1409
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:47,960
Yes.

1410
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:48,960
Yeah.

1411
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:49,960
I like that a lot.

1412
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:50,960
Yeah.

1413
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:51,960
This is the future of pair hacking.

1414
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:52,960
Yeah.

1415
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:53,960
There's already a pair program.

1416
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,200
We could have competitions around this legitimately.

1417
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:59,640
We could set up because we can populate that thing with like rewards and like things for

1418
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:00,640
people to find.

1419
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:01,640
Oh yeah.

1420
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:02,640
And it seems very configurable hackable.

1421
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:03,640
It's just like a Python.

1422
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:09,520
Imagine if we if we seeded that with with a pretty big user land full and we had files

1423
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,760
in there they had to find and get access to as part of a challenge so you have to get

1424
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:17,400
access to the remote S.H. box and get in there and find certain things on the file system.

1425
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,400
That could be a fun game.

1426
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,320
And you could watch it all in real time.

1427
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,000
Now everybody so I'm just going to mention it real quick and we have a great tutorial

1428
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,240
linked in the show notes.

1429
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,400
Everybody knows you can use S.S.H. to copy files right.

1430
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,400
You guys all know that.

1431
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:28,960
I think that's pretty basic.

1432
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:30,560
You probably if you're listening to this show know that.

1433
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:35,100
But if you don't or you haven't messed around with a lot if you've ever heard that Linux

1434
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:38,320
is hard to copy files around on networks then you don't know about S.C.P.

1435
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,600
So we have a link in the show notes that walks you through how to use it.

1436
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:45,440
I use it almost every single day almost almost but you're just moving something down from

1437
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,080
a droplet to my machine or something like that.

1438
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,080
Like I just.

1439
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:51,760
Especially if you're doing it right and you already have your key off authenticated that

1440
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:52,760
kind of stuff set up.

1441
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,760
It makes it very easy.

1442
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,560
And we have we have some instructions on that too.

1443
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:59,160
There are commands you can do to remotely copy your keys around and we're going to we're

1444
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,640
going to get to that.

1445
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,840
Before we go any further though I before I go through my list does anybody in the Mamba

1446
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,040
room have something they use S.S.H. for all the time like you know copying files with

1447
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:11,880
our sink or something like that that they want to mention because I think there's some

1448
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:17,280
uses that people have come up with for S.S.H. like publish something remotely or grab something

1449
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:20,880
or update something remotely that a lot of us don't think about because we don't have

1450
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:21,880
those use cases.

1451
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,640
If somebody has an interesting S.S.H. uses I'd love to hear it.

1452
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:31,240
I heard in my in the company I work in if any of the developers is using S.S.H. to connect

1453
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:37,040
to somewhere to do some administrative work usually means somebody's getting fired.

1454
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:38,040
Why?

1455
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:42,280
Because system administrators should be just have everything magically working for the

1456
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:46,440
developer not to have to go there and set anything up.

1457
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:50,320
Yeah so they want them and they basically don't want them having shell access.

1458
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,200
Yeah they shouldn't be needed.

1459
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:57,840
Like we're trying to get rid of system administrators and now we're just praising apps for system

1460
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:58,840
administration.

1461
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,120
Well there I mean there is a certain amount of truth there it just in that like ideally

1462
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:07,980
and it depends very much on the case and how much technical debt you have etc etc but ideally

1463
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:11,920
you should have like a log server set up you should have that being absorbed somewhere

1464
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,680
you should have configuration management set up so that ideally the need to S.S.H. is minimal

1465
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:20,760
but there are lots of cases QA etc where you really do need that S.S.H.

1466
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:21,760
Yeah sure.

1467
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,920
I'd love to hear the use cases over at Solace.

1468
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:33,360
So in Solace we had to come up with a scalable build system as you can imagine and we use

1469
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:38,000
S.S.H. in a couple of ways to achieve this basically the there is a couple of rules whenever

1470
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,520
writing any software.

1471
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:44,300
Rule number one never write your own crypto algorithm never do it.

1472
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:51,080
It's rule number one rule number two behind that really apart from don't use GLib it should

1473
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,900
probably be don't reinvent authentication.

1474
01:14:53,900 --> 01:15:01,160
So have any of you guys used anything like Garrett or get a light or anything like that.

1475
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,080
Yeah I've seen it get a light before.

1476
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:08,000
Okay so one of the very unknown features of S.S.H. is you can actually tell it to run

1477
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
a command associated with a public key.

1478
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Oh yeah.

1479
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,080
So what we've taken advantage of there is there is an isolated S.S.H.D. which is completely

1480
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:20,780
separate from the Solace infrastructure itself.

1481
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:26,280
This one is public key based only and exists only to serve our build system.

1482
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:30,000
So you have to have a public key and what it does is it S.S.H. is to our script that

1483
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:35,100
runs behind this as a server if you like which then controls all the builds and uses a database

1484
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,480
to store the builds there.

1485
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:41,680
So we've got public key authentication and we've got Unix PAM authentication going on

1486
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:42,680
in the background there.

1487
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,680
We didn't have to reinvent any of that.

1488
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:50,480
The build servers as well do it though so we can just revoke a key immediately for any

1489
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:54,000
of these servers that are doing it in a pull based system instead of a scheduler and pushing

1490
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,400
them out.

1491
01:15:55,400 --> 01:16:01,600
On top of that our packages are also uploaded with SCP over another S.S.H.D. with only one

1492
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:07,360
there's only one that can upload to this S.S.H.D. which is a true directory where the files

1493
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:12,760
then land before an I notify team in the background then pulls those files in to index them into

1494
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:13,760
the unstable repo.

1495
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,200
So it's all S.S.H. powered.

1496
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,200
That's pretty nice.

1497
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,200
I like that.

1498
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:22,720
Nice and secure and easy to understand too.

1499
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:27,640
Now Wimpy you said you use something that does hardware acceleration for S.S.H.

1500
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:32,440
What do you what are you talking about or in combination with hardware elaborate sir.

1501
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:38,920
Well so you've got the different crypto algorithms that you can negotiate to establish a S.S.H.

1502
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:43,560
connection and if you're just you know at the terminal that's kind of irrelevant but

1503
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:51,880
if you're R-syncing or S.C.P.ing data then you should elect the crypto algorithm that

1504
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,760
is most accelerated on your platform.

1505
01:16:54,760 --> 01:17:01,560
So there are ways to evaluate what the hardware capabilities are both ends and you can then

1506
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:07,640
configure your S.S.H. config so that when you're connecting to particular hosts it forces to

1507
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:11,600
use the most accelerated crypto algorithm.

1508
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:22,400
And generally those are the AES 128 GCM and AES 256 GCM algorithms and they can run just

1509
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,040
over more than twice the speed of the others.

1510
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:33,040
So you can on the line get nearly up to 400 megabits per second transfer speed as opposed

1511
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:39,560
to the default which will be maybe 160 170 megabits.

1512
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,680
That is a good one.

1513
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:48,200
And Darsani you have kind of an interesting use case where you wanted to remotely watch

1514
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,120
a server's traffic to do some troubleshooting.

1515
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,920
Tell me about this.

1516
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:56,760
Well I was testing a, first of all can you hear me?

1517
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:57,760
Yeah yeah we hear you.

1518
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:58,760
Okay okay.

1519
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:05,360
I was testing this man-in-the-middle sort of software it would watch outbound packages

1520
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:12,560
to make sure that you know no one was suspiciously sending bad, sorry secret stuff to the network

1521
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:13,760
right.

1522
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:21,520
And so we had to use a regex and it would watch the outbound traffic using regex.

1523
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:27,120
So I ran a, well I had to do both of the things on my server right.

1524
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:33,440
I had to watch the wowza traffic which is a RTMP server and I had to run that on my

1525
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:38,480
local machine and then I had to run the client to the local machine.

1526
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,320
So I had to use a SH tunnel to myself.

1527
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:45,880
I could have used netcat but I didn't have that available at the time.

1528
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:54,720
So I was able to watch the traffic inbound on the wowza server and then like TCP dump

1529
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:59,440
it or was it Wireshark it so I can read it.

1530
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:04,040
Yes that is super super useful and a nice little, well not a hack but it's a hack in

1531
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:08,640
like the workflow sense a hack where you can sort of put yourself over there.

1532
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:14,760
You know you heard us mentioning keys there is a command called ssh-copy-id and then user

1533
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:20,240
at host and this is a nice way to enable passwordless logins, copy your keys around.

1534
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,240
We have a couple of articles.

1535
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:24,640
I have a couple that I highlighted like you can output, here's a good one.

1536
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,840
You can output your microphone to a remote computer speaker.

1537
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:35,680
If I don't have not tried this but supposedly using DD and then piping it over to SSH and

1538
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:41,600
then at the remote host using DD to go to their sound device the output of the sound

1539
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:45,800
from your microphone port to the SSH target's computer speaker port, sound quality is very

1540
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:48,120
bad so you hear a lot of hissing.

1541
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:52,520
I haven't tried it but that sounds freaking ridiculous.

1542
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:57,480
Also you can attach to a screen over SSH which that's probably a hack worth mentioning right

1543
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:05,200
there is use screen with SSH, use screen with SSH and also how to establish a remote GNU

1544
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:09,280
screen session that you can reconnect to right by starting the SSH command.

1545
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:14,520
You SSH in to the machine and then you execute the user bin screen command dash lowercase

1546
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:17,760
X capital RR and then start with the screen session.

1547
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,060
That's a good tip right there.

1548
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:20,060
Screen with that.

1549
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:23,920
Just reading the SSH man page is a great tip I think honestly.

1550
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,280
There are so many arguments there that just are gold mines.

1551
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:32,680
Did you find this hacker news thread where a bunch of people posted their favorite quote

1552
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:39,200
unquote things you can make SSH do and there's some very good ones over here that we'll link

1553
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,520
in the show notes too also.

1554
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:49,600
So I think I have probably shared this story before but I'll risk sharing it again.

1555
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,480
I don't know if I actually have shared it on the show but before I do it, is anybody

1556
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,400
else in the – oh there we go, Mr. Fax.

1557
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,400
You had – Auto SSH, right.

1558
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:57,400
Yeah, I saw that earlier.

1559
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:58,400
Tell me about Auto SSH.

1560
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:02,680
Well, Auto SSH is very cool.

1561
01:21:02,680 --> 01:21:07,720
For example, if you have a remote computer that cannot open a firewall port but you have

1562
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:15,360
a server at home that can open the port, then you can set up Auto SSH that the server automatically

1563
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:21,200
– that the client connects to the server automatically and then you do a reverse, tunnel

1564
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,840
to the client and get a shell of the client.

1565
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:29,280
And so you can use Auto SSH for backing up the client via Orsync or something else.

1566
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,440
It's really, really cool.

1567
01:21:31,440 --> 01:21:33,240
That is – I like that.

1568
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:35,040
And so it's Auto SSH.

1569
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:40,520
So Wimpy, you were talking about fwknop which is like a – I'm guessing a port-knocking

1570
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,520
tool.

1571
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,520
What's this?

1572
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:43,520
It's not port-knocking.

1573
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:50,600
It's a single packet authentication mechanism so it's like an additional layer on top

1574
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,600
of SSH.

1575
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:56,560
So like instead of port-knocking, something maybe – like an alternative, cool, cool.

1576
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:05,840
So it's sort of a key-based packet authentication mechanism that then enables you the rest of

1577
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:09,320
your SSH connection to then establish.

1578
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:14,400
So you can have SPA and then you have your key-based authentication.

1579
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,640
So this is the way we have things.

1580
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:22,840
We have SPA, key-based authentication and then you get a one-time password as well.

1581
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:28,240
And it actually prints the QR code on the terminal that you can scan with your phone

1582
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,920
to get your then second factor as well.

1583
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,880
So it's like three-factor authentication to an SSH jump server.

1584
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,040
That's awesome.

1585
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:43,560
I guess I almost feel like I have to mention, yes, you can do X11 forwarding with SSH too.

1586
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:46,240
I think people would be like, how come you didn't mention this?

1587
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:49,160
And probably remote command execution.

1588
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:53,040
You can just send a remote command over there, which is amazing.

1589
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,040
The other one is –

1590
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,040
Socks proxying.

1591
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,040
Yes.

1592
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:57,040
Socks proxying is huge.

1593
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,040
Of course.

1594
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,040
I have to mention that, yeah.

1595
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,600
I will say too, like you were talking about SCP, which works great, but when you're doing

1596
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:04,520
a recursive copy, a lot of times piping tar over SSH will be better.

1597
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,520
Yeah.

1598
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,520
Or rsync.

1599
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,000
I used rsync in combination.

1600
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:14,040
So rsync is managing the file copy, but it's doing it through SSH, which if you think about

1601
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:17,000
it, is such a brilliant combination of two of the best things.

1602
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,760
It's legitimately like Nutella and peanut butter, which really does go well together,

1603
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,800
and peanut butter and jelly, which my kids don't think go well together, but one day

1604
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,480
I will convince them does go well together.

1605
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:33,840
It is so great, because you get the power and really the reliability and peace of mind

1606
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:39,700
of rsync with the encryption and protection of SCP or SSH.

1607
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:40,780
So that's a great combo too.

1608
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:44,520
So I feel like I'd be probably remiss, because a lot of comments would be, how come you didn't

1609
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:45,520
say this?

1610
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,120
Those are sort of the obvious ones too.

1611
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:50,760
Yeah, the proxying stuff is really nice.

1612
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:55,160
I've seen a lot of articles online called the poor man's VPN using SSH.

1613
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:56,840
There's a lot of articles that cover how to do that.

1614
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:00,700
Oh yeah, especially the SOCKS proxy, aka the capital D flag.

1615
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:02,640
It's better than rsync thing.

1616
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:03,640
Hmm.

1617
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:04,640
Yeah, maybe.

1618
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,840
Yeah, that might be true.

1619
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:11,240
All right, Mumble Room, anybody else have an SSH tip or trick or hack that they love

1620
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:13,240
about SSH before we move on?

1621
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:14,960
Going once.

1622
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:15,960
You do?

1623
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:16,960
I do.

1624
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,520
I just want to mention the lowercase w flag for setting up ton slash tap devices.

1625
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:23,440
SSH can be your layer two, layer three VPN.

1626
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:24,440
It's all over TCP.

1627
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:27,760
So if you're super performance critical, it's not the thing to do.

1628
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:33,080
If you're on a good connection, I've gotten speed ups over bad links using DigitalOcean.

1629
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:37,080
Or if you just want something like you have some apps that don't respect SOCKS proxies,

1630
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:41,640
but you want to proxy them through SSH, on Linux you just bam, now you have a new interface,

1631
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:42,640
bind them to that interface.

1632
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:43,640
There you go.

1633
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:46,920
And it's nice because everything you need is already installed, as long as you have

1634
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:47,920
SSH installed.

1635
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:48,920
Exactly.

1636
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:49,920
And so it's, and you know it's there.

1637
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:52,720
You just need to enable the right things in your SSH deconfig on the other end, but that's

1638
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:53,720
the case for a lot of these.

1639
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:56,560
Will you toss that in the show notes too, how to do that?

1640
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:57,920
We'll have a link in there, how to do that.

1641
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:02,500
You know, this is actually, so how to do it, I should really stop right here and I should

1642
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:07,220
mention Linux Academy because if we're talking about this stuff and it's a little over your

1643
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:12,360
head or you want to know more, Linux Academies would just be a fantastic resource.

1644
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:15,440
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug to support this show.

1645
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:19,480
Now they also have all the advanced topics around Linux, but it really is a great platform

1646
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,200
for learning more about this kind of stuff.

1647
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:25,440
They've got the essentials and really all of the things that have sort of been built

1648
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,440
on top of it.

1649
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:31,640
Stuff you really, if you haven't been through proper training, the little details you might

1650
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:34,860
have missed that make a difference, plus on top of all of it they have instructor mentoring

1651
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:36,040
to help you as you go.

1652
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:40,440
Learning paths, series of courses and content planned by instructors for very specific types

1653
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:45,900
of career tracks, and then if you're busy, they have learning plans, so you can pick

1654
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:49,680
a course and set a time frame and fit to it that matches your schedule.

1655
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:52,800
They have note cards that can be forked by the community to help with studying.

1656
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:57,520
They have video courses with self-paced in-depth video guides on every single freaking topic

1657
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:02,380
around Linux, the cloud itself, DevOps.

1658
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:06,500
The labs and exercises are unique because they give you the real world confidence to

1659
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,080
do this stuff.

1660
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:12,200
You're walking away from something where you've really worked hands-on with it, so you have

1661
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:18,880
the confidence to work with the real technology in production.

1662
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:23,980
For me personally, that would be worth the entire Linux Academy subscription right there.

1663
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:29,600
The Nuggets give you a deep dive into something when you just want to go into a single topic,

1664
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,440
and they have iOS and Android apps to help you study from your mobile device.

1665
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:36,080
They have a community stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members because they've been

1666
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:39,560
advertising here for a while now, and they're constantly expanding.

1667
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:41,580
They're always adding new content.

1668
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:43,600
They're always improving the previous content.

1669
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:48,800
From fundamentals to the advanced stuff, check them out at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1670
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:53,080
If anything we've mentioned today sounds new to you, you probably could have learned more

1671
01:26:53,080 --> 01:27:00,120
at Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1672
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:07,720
Over the years, I have bought into many management systems, systems to manage my photos, systems

1673
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:13,840
to manage my mp3s, applications and systems to manage my notes, my personal notes, my

1674
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:17,240
client notes, my family notes, my work.

1675
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:23,240
Oh, Wes, you know what I've learned after all of these years?

1676
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,840
Just put it on the damn file system.

1677
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,460
Turns out we solved this in the early 90s.

1678
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:29,880
Just make a damn file out of it.

1679
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:33,720
If you have it on the damn file system, then I can get to it when I SSHN.

1680
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,720
I can get to it when I bring up my file manager.

1681
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:37,680
I can get to it from my Guake drop-down terminal.

1682
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:44,680
I can get to it from an application that sits on top of it.

1683
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:52,280
Not many times, I would imagine, in my adult life will I sort of completely start over.

1684
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:56,960
The house I moved out of, it was unique because we had a lot of input on how it was built.

1685
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:01,800
I had a lot of knowledge of how it was wired and where everything was done at and what

1686
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:06,800
was what, but I didn't properly capture that information.

1687
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,960
As time went on, the details became fuzzy.

1688
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:13,840
I thought I'd memorize it, and today I couldn't even tell you how many Ethernet ports I had

1689
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:17,200
installed, which to me just seems ridiculous.

1690
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:21,280
Now that I've moved into LadyJubes and I've begun building a home network, which you and

1691
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:27,760
I were talking about on the pre-show, I thought to myself, I am really at such a square one

1692
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:30,880
position again, which is so rare, which I know you're kind of going through the same

1693
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,880
thing having just moved.

1694
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:38,160
It's rare when you're like, I can tear down everything I have right now and start fresh.

1695
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:42,800
One of the things I have learned about myself is I will forget the little details over time

1696
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,640
because life goes on.

1697
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:47,640
I thought, wouldn't it be wonderful?

1698
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:54,320
Wouldn't it be an accomplishment if I could document properly everything, serial numbers,

1699
01:28:54,320 --> 01:29:00,040
warranty information, support information, implementation, configuration details, and

1700
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:04,280
have a spot to put it all that I could recall it fairly easily.

1701
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:09,480
That started me down the path of trying to find the perfect wiki software.

1702
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:13,640
I think I kind of blame Noah for this because he started talking about it on Linux Action

1703
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:14,640
Show this Sunday.

1704
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:18,800
It's a diary where he puts his thoughts and feelings into about clients and stuff.

1705
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:21,940
And I thought, geez, I could really use a spot that was kind of safe.

1706
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:25,000
Some sort of like personal store, you can come back to it.

1707
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,000
It's there when you want it.

1708
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,240
You can ignore it when you want to.

1709
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:32,320
And maybe, and legitimately, Wes, years could go by before I have to reference information.

1710
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,400
Without touching it.

1711
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,720
It's like maybe my refrigerator's warranty information.

1712
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:40,080
Or that old notebook you have and you come back and you're like, okay, yeah, that's right.

1713
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:46,460
And so I started with DocuWiki, which is a very simple to use local wiki.

1714
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:47,760
It's really nice.

1715
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:52,780
I highly recommend it if you are very familiar with its Wiki Sinti.

1716
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:55,440
But it didn't fit my needs.

1717
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,480
So I was a little disappointed.

1718
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:01,880
I looked at MD Wiki, didn't fit my needs, hasn't been updated.

1719
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:04,440
So I've been a little disappointed.

1720
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:09,440
So Wimpy, I want to hear about ZimWiki because it is definitely a name I've seen go by online,

1721
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,320
even if mentioned by the community a few times.

1722
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:12,680
Have you messed around with it?

1723
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:17,880
Yeah, it's what I use for keeping all of my sort of documentation notes.

1724
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:24,640
So it's a desktop wiki, a GTK desktop application for doing wiki and note taking.

1725
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:28,920
And it does, you know, document linking, just like how wiki works.

1726
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:31,800
But all of the documents are just text documents.

1727
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:35,800
So I've got those synchronized to all of my machines.

1728
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:39,680
Now the syntax, is it like its own unique little special syntax?

1729
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:40,680
Or is it?

1730
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:44,960
Well, I'll tell you what, I'll bring one up in a text editor rather than Zim and I'll

1731
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:45,960
tell you.

1732
01:30:45,960 --> 01:30:46,960
Oh, OK.

1733
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:47,960
Yeah.

1734
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:50,640
And and it just it just it just looks at local files on your file system.

1735
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:54,200
And yeah, so I just got a folder called notebooks.

1736
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:56,120
I think I have looked at ZimWiki in the past.

1737
01:30:56,120 --> 01:30:58,520
You know, it does seem very familiar.

1738
01:30:58,520 --> 01:30:59,520
Yeah.

1739
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:02,320
But so why use this instead of just create files on your file system?

1740
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:08,720
Why not just have a directory structure that makes sense and just put on the file system?

1741
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:18,600
They its content type is text X in wiki and the markup looks like markdown ish.

1742
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:19,600
Hmm.

1743
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,600
Hmm.

1744
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,320
I like markdown ish.

1745
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:26,640
I mean, it depends on how close, but and and you find this to be more efficient than just

1746
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,320
having a good file structure?

1747
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:36,520
Yes, because you can cross link the documents and you can create like a higher level category

1748
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:39,480
and then hierarchies within that.

1749
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:41,960
And it does the wiki linking within it as well.

1750
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:49,400
So if you want to link back to stuff, I think I mean, I don't use it for formatting.

1751
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:52,600
I use it for hurling information in.

1752
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:59,200
So when I'm chatting to people on IRC, I just grab whole conversations out of IRC, dump

1753
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,960
them into Zim wiki.

1754
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:05,880
So I've got a record of that and then I can go through and, you know, tidy up a later

1755
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:09,500
date and turn it into something, you know, more useful.

1756
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:12,320
In fact, I've got all of my documentation in there.

1757
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,920
And how are you syncing that at all?

1758
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:15,680
Are you just one machine has it all?

1759
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:18,360
No, I'm I sync it.

1760
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:20,120
Using?

1761
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:21,720
I use Sparkle Share for that.

1762
01:32:21,720 --> 01:32:24,160
Oh, man, I want to use I want to pick it up.

1763
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:25,440
I'm thinking about using Sparkle Share.

1764
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,000
You know, that's the one I haven't tried.

1765
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,720
Yeah, I like.

1766
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:31,280
For this Sparkle Share works really well.

1767
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:32,280
Yeah.

1768
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:36,120
Because it's just text you come in, you can put screenshots and stuff in there.

1769
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:40,160
And Sparkle Share is designed to do that sort of collaboration thing.

1770
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:44,920
So it's got get behind the scenes, you just blast all up to GitHub, you just like slam

1771
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:46,280
it all up there.

1772
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,440
You don't have to do it.

1773
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,280
Sparkle Share just does it for you.

1774
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:53,620
It's the read and write operations and does all of the commits for you.

1775
01:32:53,620 --> 01:32:55,240
And it has a format for the commit.

1776
01:32:55,240 --> 01:33:00,560
So you can see what was an addition or an edit or a deletion or, you know, and so on.

1777
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,240
So it just takes care of it all for you.

1778
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:06,880
As I recall, the last time I do remember now looking at this, you can do things like you

1779
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:11,120
can set bolted lists, or I mean, lists that you can checkbox like checkbox lists, you

1780
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,960
can have calendar embeds with reminders.

1781
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,800
Oh, yeah, that is quite a lot of functionality.

1782
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,240
Yeah, this is a good one.

1783
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:19,440
This is Zim Wiki, I think has got to be top of my list.

1784
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,700
Here's the other one I'm playing with right now.

1785
01:33:21,700 --> 01:33:24,200
And I don't know if you've had a chance to try it out.

1786
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:28,840
It's called, it's been recommended before, I think I might have mentioned it even before,

1787
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:31,320
and I've been intending to really give it a go.

1788
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:33,160
It's called Tagspaces.

1789
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:36,080
And you can find it at tagspaces.org.

1790
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:40,620
And it's an open source personal data manager, quote unquote, that helps you organize and

1791
01:33:40,620 --> 01:33:43,200
browse your files on every platform.

1792
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,320
Now, here's a couple of the details.

1793
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,880
And I'll tell you why I ended up using it too.

1794
01:33:47,880 --> 01:33:49,560
It's running completely offline.

1795
01:33:49,560 --> 01:33:53,560
There's no cloud integration at all, no login required.

1796
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:57,840
And you can still use it on platforms like own cloud or Dropbox or BitTorrent Sync Sync

1797
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:01,660
thing, Sparkle file, Spider Oak, whatever.

1798
01:34:01,660 --> 01:34:06,080
It's got a pay version, and it's also all open source.

1799
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:11,360
So I like that it does have a sustainable revenue model that seems pretty reasonable.

1800
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:12,360
Totally.

1801
01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:13,360
I'm going to be around for a while.

1802
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,340
If I'm going to rely on it, yeah.

1803
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:17,040
It is an Electron app.

1804
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,980
I'll get that out here, but then I'll tell you a bit more about it.

1805
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:24,120
You can organize your photos, eBooks, music, recipes, invoices, and you can do it on Windows,

1806
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:28,640
Linux, OS X, Android, Firefox, and Chrome because they have plug-ins.

1807
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:31,440
It features basic file management operations.

1808
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:34,640
You can create edit notes in plain text, markdown, or HTML.

1809
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:38,080
You can use Tagspaces to organize eBooks too, which I think is especially nice.

1810
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:43,500
But on top of that, which is also especially nice, is managing PDFs.

1811
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:47,860
This is something where I have gotten an influx recently of manuals and PDFs for pieces of

1812
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:52,440
equipment that I now have in Lady Jupiter, and what the hell do I do with these PDFs?

1813
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:55,520
How do I keep track of which one's for the water pump, which one's for the furnace, which

1814
01:34:55,520 --> 01:35:01,140
one's for the inverter, which one's for the converter, which one's for the black tank?

1815
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:05,660
This is ridiculous, and so this kind of helps me put my head around all of this, and also

1816
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:09,960
it does the same thing for photos, which is nice because I have photos of particular pieces

1817
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:11,960
of equipment and electronics.

1818
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:16,840
The application supports adding tags to files in a transparent, not vendor-locking way.

1819
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:19,040
You can tag your files by simply drag and drop actions.

1820
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,360
You can organize your tags thematically in groups.

1821
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:24,480
It has smart tags too for date-based stuff.

1822
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:27,460
Of course, it has file and search and all that.

1823
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:29,480
It has a quote-unquote responsive design.

1824
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:30,480
You can resize it.

1825
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:38,400
You can browse by tag, and it has a pro version if you want to spend the money, and I've only

1826
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,400
begun working with it.

1827
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,440
And it sits right on top of whatever file system you have.

1828
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:45,660
Exactly, and that's what I like is, so at the end of the day, I could SSH into a home

1829
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:49,460
server and just browse the file system and get this information, but if I'm sitting at

1830
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:54,640
a machine, there's a bunch of different filters I can get at and use based on tags or metadata

1831
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:59,720
information or file creation date or category or by linking.

1832
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:04,820
I could go look at the RV branch or the audio equipment branch and have all of the information

1833
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:11,860
I need in there, and I like that I can also then include things like pictures and markdown

1834
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:16,120
information so I can put links in there and all of it's offline.

1835
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:17,680
See, that part is awesome.

1836
01:36:17,680 --> 01:36:22,320
So all I have to do is load up a computer with this to sit on top of the file system.

1837
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,320
It scans the file system.

1838
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:24,320
It gets this information.

1839
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,000
Where does it store its configuration?

1840
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,280
Now I haven't dug too far, but there is a database file.

1841
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:34,680
So the way I currently use it is I downloaded the entire thing, and there's packages available,

1842
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:37,660
but it's also an Electron app, so I just downloaded a single directory.

1843
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:38,660
Everything is self-contained.

1844
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:41,640
All the data files, config are all in this one directory.

1845
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:46,040
I tar.gz this one folder, and I've got everything I need.

1846
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,040
I extract that.

1847
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:50,680
I've got everything I need to just have it once again point at the file system, and it's

1848
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:51,920
good to go again.

1849
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,040
So that's been working.

1850
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:55,800
That's sort of a real portable setup because I've been able to replicate that a couple

1851
01:36:55,800 --> 01:37:00,160
of times now and have it look at the same network path, and that's been pretty solid.

1852
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:04,080
So this isn't totally in production yet because my final plan would be I'm going to set up

1853
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:09,540
a final file server in LadyJubes, put all of the data on that, and then from a laptop

1854
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:10,920
front end point this at it.

1855
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:14,200
So I've just been experimenting temporarily, and I'm liking this.

1856
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:16,160
I'm not totally done yet.

1857
01:37:16,160 --> 01:37:21,920
So there is still room for something like ZimWiki or another solution, but the one thing

1858
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,700
I do like about this is over the years I keep going back to just putting it on the file

1859
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:30,400
system for my photos, my audio books, my MP3s, my docs.

1860
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,400
Just put it on the file system.

1861
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:35,560
And especially it excels at that if you can bin it and just stick it in a thing, like

1862
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:40,200
a drill down hierarchy, and so if this can add that missing layer of kind of like how

1863
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:41,200
do I find related things?

1864
01:37:41,200 --> 01:37:42,200
How do I find these?

1865
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:45,440
I don't want to put them in the same folder, but I do want to know that they're related.

1866
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,480
So if that could easily add that on top, that's very interesting.

1867
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,480
And it's also available for Android.

1868
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:52,240
Now I don't know exactly how this would work.

1869
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:55,680
I don't know how I would point Android at the same data source.

1870
01:37:55,680 --> 01:38:00,720
However, they do have some WebDAV support, and I've included that in the show notes where

1871
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:04,160
you can host it and then use WebDAV to connect to it.

1872
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:08,320
Maybe that's how I could have my laptop and my Android client accessing the same information.

1873
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:12,640
I'm not sure I'd want to expose it this way, but it's nice that it can look at a WebDAV

1874
01:38:12,640 --> 01:38:15,680
share and have the same functionality.

1875
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,440
But if I was really going to go that route, I'd probably use something like Spider Oak

1876
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:22,960
or C file or some sort of background syncing service, yeah.

1877
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:23,960
So that's tag spaces.

1878
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:25,760
I really have to think I'm going to give that a try.

1879
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:29,240
I've looked at some like there's some fuse based tags, file systems, that sort of thing,

1880
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:32,360
and none of them have really stuck.

1881
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:34,920
Have you thought about as you're setting up your network in your new place, if you're

1882
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:39,200
going to take down notes on how things are set up, like what the passwords are and...

1883
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:42,520
Yeah, you know, and I do have my own key pass database and that kind of thing.

1884
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:43,840
You just kind of keep notes in there right now?

1885
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:48,480
I do that for like account based things, but there's a lot of stuff, kind of stuff you're

1886
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:52,680
hitting on, a lot of that maintenance stuff, a lot of the just the little details in life

1887
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:55,920
that I don't, you know, maybe they're in Google Drive.

1888
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:57,580
Maybe they're on my own file server.

1889
01:38:57,580 --> 01:39:01,140
Maybe they're backed up in tar snap, but I don't have a lot of those linkages between

1890
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:03,760
them and I rely on the find command or something like that.

1891
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:07,680
So this seems like a really good way to be like, okay, these are all associated with

1892
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:08,680
the network.

1893
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:12,840
These are all associated with, you know, the appliances that I own.

1894
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:15,040
So I'm very curious to see how that works out.

1895
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:18,040
And I do think that the, you know, there's a lot of objections to being an electron app,

1896
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:21,720
but this seems like also kind of a middle ground where it's actually kind of reasonable

1897
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:25,720
because the features they want, I like that it's very pretty.

1898
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:26,720
It seems usable.

1899
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:29,800
It seems like something I could have someone who wasn't even a Linux user or a tech savvy

1900
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:32,600
person jump right in and use it without worrying about it.

1901
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:37,200
Seriously, when you first launch it, it steps you through sort of the logic of the application

1902
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:41,320
and it gives you a good layout of how this is, how you interact with it.

1903
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:42,640
This is where things are stored at.

1904
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:43,640
Yeah, that's really nice.

1905
01:39:43,640 --> 01:39:48,200
Wimpy, you had a point of clarification about open filer or filler or I don't know unless

1906
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:51,040
go ahead, sir, fire away.

1907
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:56,160
At the end of this week's lash, you said that you were experimenting with open filer.

1908
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:57,200
Yes, sir.

1909
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:59,040
Did you mean open filer?

1910
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,040
I don't know.

1911
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:01,040
I guess.

1912
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,040
Why would I not?

1913
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:03,520
I don't think Chris knows what he's talking about.

1914
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:05,160
Have you listened to the show before?

1915
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:08,040
I have not installed it.

1916
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:15,060
I intend to install on an Intel NUC attached to probably about three terabytes worth of

1917
01:40:15,060 --> 01:40:21,160
test storage open filer, but unless I'm calling for it.

1918
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:22,560
You're getting name conflated.

1919
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:23,560
With what?

1920
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:26,640
So we were discussing Open Media Vault.

1921
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:27,640
There are two of them.

1922
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:28,640
Yes, that's right.

1923
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:29,920
Yeah, maybe I was because I haven't downloaded it yet.

1924
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:30,920
So maybe I was.

1925
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:33,800
That's actually my to-do this week.

1926
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,680
Open filer is like a sort of a dead project.

1927
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:38,520
So you and I were discussing Open Media Vault.

1928
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:39,520
I can't keep it straight anymore.

1929
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:40,520
Yeah.

1930
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:41,520
I guess I probably was.

1931
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:42,520
It was probably that's what I give for it.

1932
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:44,000
Was it an off-the-cuff comment that I make?

1933
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,600
Was an off-the-cuff thing I said on the show?

1934
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,400
Yeah, it was towards the end of the show.

1935
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:48,400
Yeah.

1936
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,400
Yeah.

1937
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:52,740
Sometimes when I speak off-the-cuff, I don't really, I get, I do that, I got in trouble

1938
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:58,540
last week for saying something off-the-cuff too, which was just a totally like, I just,

1939
01:40:58,540 --> 01:40:59,540
you know what I'm talking about.

1940
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:00,540
I do.

1941
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:02,840
I don't know what my problem is.

1942
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:03,840
I don't know what it is.

1943
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:07,680
And unless it's a prepared statement, take Chris's words with a grain of salt.

1944
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:09,920
He probably means like two versions different.

1945
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:10,920
I would like that not to be the case though.

1946
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:13,280
Or around the name by a few letters.

1947
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:16,740
The only reason I'm seeking clarification is because Chris and I've been discussing

1948
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:17,740
Open Media Vault.

1949
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:21,960
And if he downloads Open Filer thinking this is what I recommended, he's going to be very

1950
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:22,960
disappointed.

1951
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:24,600
Well, I did download Open Filer though.

1952
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:30,080
So I guess I just won't even, I haven't installed it yet, but I have downloaded it.

1953
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,680
And I don't know if I've downloaded Open Media Vault.

1954
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:34,960
I feel like I should, so the project's not being, because I feel like I was going to,

1955
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:35,960
I should at least look at it.

1956
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:40,320
But if the project's not really being worked on, that sort of seals that deal for me.

1957
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:45,720
I thought it had sort of stagnated and when, SP in the chat room says 2011.

1958
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:50,300
Yeah when you look at their documentation, they talk about Linux 2.6.

1959
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:53,520
So you are, this is probably, this is a good time to mention this.

1960
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:56,080
So I don't want to overdo this.

1961
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:59,920
I know I've talked about this a lot recently, but I'm currently in the process of redoing

1962
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:02,560
my network storage and I want to try out a bunch of things.

1963
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:05,720
And I had Rockstore on the list too, although I just recently eliminated that, I was talking

1964
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,240
to Wes about that earlier today.

1965
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:10,120
It sounds like Open Filer's off the list now.

1966
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:17,700
Right now what's on my list is Open Media Vault and Free NAS and I have feelers into

1967
01:42:17,700 --> 01:42:23,200
QNAP because they have a rig that runs Ubuntu that I think would also be very cool.

1968
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:28,760
Now I'm just crossing, I'm just going to cross Rockstore and Open Filer off the list, which

1969
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:33,640
really brings it down to, if I'm going to roll it myself, Free NAS or Open Media Vault.

1970
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:39,280
Like I'm down to two now and what's pushing me towards Open Media Vault in honesty is

1971
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:42,560
Wimpy has got a great testimony for it.

1972
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:45,280
He's really sort of sold me on it.

1973
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:48,240
Do you want to talk about your implementation at all or at least why you've been happy with

1974
01:42:48,240 --> 01:42:49,240
it?

1975
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:53,200
Yeah, I mean I've been using it for years and years now.

1976
01:42:53,200 --> 01:43:00,480
I think I started using it around the 0.4 period and it's 2. something is the stable

1977
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:07,120
release and 3.0 is imminent I think looking at how that's been developing.

1978
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:12,360
But it's a Debian based NAS solution.

1979
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:19,040
The two series is based on Weezy and the three series is based on Jessie.

1980
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:26,240
There's a site called omvextras.org which is the community maintained plugins and it

1981
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:34,640
has plugins for quite literally everything imaginable including ZFS and SnapRaid and

1982
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:42,120
Grey Hole and just about every disk management and redundancy strategy you can imagine.

1983
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:46,720
So it's a fun thing to play with because you can really explore the options that best suit

1984
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:54,840
you if you just want to add disks of unequal sizes there are redundancy strategies to support

1985
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:55,840
that.

1986
01:43:55,840 --> 01:44:00,120
Or you can go with ZFS or you can go with LVMs and XFS you know there's a whole raft

1987
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:01,320
of options.

1988
01:44:01,320 --> 01:44:08,160
But it's got plugins for MB server and Plex server and all of the stuff that some people

1989
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:11,640
use sick beard and couch potato and stuff like that.

1990
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:12,640
Nice.

1991
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:13,640
The essential.

1992
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:18,720
Yeah it just is just everything it just you know all in one thing and because it's Debian

1993
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:24,960
under the hood when you need to you can just SSH into it and set up the bits that you need

1994
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:27,400
that are specific to what you want to do.

1995
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:32,640
This is exactly what I was talking about earlier this is yeah so if I so just to just to jump

1996
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:41,080
in here is it if I'm correct is it based on Debian 8 is it or so 2.2 whatever the current

1997
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:45,320
two series is which is the stable version currently that's based on wheezy which is

1998
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:50,760
Debian 7 yeah the three series which is in beta at the moment and I get the impression

1999
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:57,420
is very close to final that's based on Jesse which is Debian 8 nice okay I'm currently

2000
01:44:57,420 --> 01:45:09,860
running two instances of open media vault 2 and like you I'm preparing a nut to replace

2001
01:45:09,860 --> 01:45:14,520
both of those and that's going I'm going to I'm building that the moment that's running

2002
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:19,080
version 3 and and how has that gone so far because that's I was thinking about starting

2003
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:24,120
with 3.0 when it came to open media vault just to just so I got a sense of where they're

2004
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:30,240
going because I'm not likely to want to reload my system a month from now or up and when

2005
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:37,760
I when I went to version 2 a couple of years ago I did install the betas and upgraded them

2006
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:42,060
to final so I you know I did the initial deployment on the beta so I've done that before and it's

2007
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:48,000
been fine yeah it's fine it's got 30 terabytes hanging off the back of it so that's cooking

2008
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:53,720
along just fine and how the plugins work for you yeah so that was the thing I've been sort

2009
01:45:53,720 --> 01:46:00,040
of keeping track on how the plugins are developing and the ones that I need are now all available

2010
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:06,380
and as best as I can see all work perfectly fine so the first beta for version 3 came

2011
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:12,040
out in sort of January of this year there was another beta release about a month ago

2012
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:17,640
so you know this sort of six months development time and in that period I think a lot of the

2013
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:22,320
work has really been around the having the community maintainers for the plugins update

2014
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:30,040
their plugins to support the new API in version 3 so that on launch day all or most of the

2015
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:36,140
plugins are available yes absolutely that's that's a good healthy community you know and

2016
01:46:36,140 --> 01:46:40,880
I was just talking to Angela too she has an old arch system that hasn't been updated for

2017
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:48,200
like a year and wow I was thinking maybe we just the Chris ops special over there yeah

2018
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:55,340
and I thought well whatever whatever in media open media vault or free nas or whatever solution

2019
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:59,960
I end up on I should probably replicate because she has a knock at her house okay and so I

2020
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:04,500
think I'm gonna it whatever when I end up on I'm probably gonna do a pretty wide deployment

2021
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:09,400
of it and at least two maybe three installations well it would be really nice to have nailed

2022
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:13,160
down that like storage appliance roll at your own something you understand that you don't

2023
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:17,560
have to necessarily buy you can roll it your own and I like buying local aka having it

2024
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:22,360
run Linux yeah I think that's nice not the free nas isn't a great product no totally

2025
01:47:22,360 --> 01:47:28,700
but you already open media vault is kind of a not spin-off exactly but a reaction to free

2026
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:35,240
nas so the lead developer of open media vault was a free nas developer and he had a disagreement

2027
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:42,920
with direction that free nas was going so created a media vault as a result interesting

2028
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:48,640
and also sort of encouraging as well so I will put a link to open media vault org if

2029
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:53,800
you guys have any implementation tips or experience let me know because I'll be kicking the tires

2030
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:58,880
probably in the next couple of weeks I'll have I'm gonna I'm gonna try to get it installed

2031
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:03,980
by Thursday afternoon so I have at least a couple of weeks of production experience with

2032
01:48:03,980 --> 01:48:07,840
it and you mean so you can tell Alan that you really don't need BSD to run your storage

2033
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:13,820
appliance and then I'll probably review a little bit after that and then whatever I

2034
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:20,960
end up on I'm going to deploy a stamp of approval yeah I'll go put I'm gonna go install under

2035
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:27,920
some bench seats in in lady jibs cool so are you using a ZFS wimpy or you're using a different

2036
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:36,460
file system I've got one of the boxes so the primary box is running XFS on an LVM and the

2037
01:48:36,460 --> 01:48:44,280
backup unit is running on ZFS cool that's and when I say backup this is an active passive

2038
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:51,360
cluster so if for any reason I need to update or reboot the first one then the the other

2039
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:57,720
one takes over that's the way to do it well betide I interrupt my daughter's viewing of

2040
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:03,160
her favorite right so I'm looking back at their release log too and you know I see I

2041
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:08,120
see updates in May I see updates I think two updates in May actually and I see an update

2042
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:13,480
on June 15th so and then of course three I was just around the corner so the projects

2043
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:17,680
boy what I mean compared to open file looking open filers releases this so there's definitely

2044
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:23,440
a pulse here yeah and there's also images for the Raspberry Pi and the Odroid C2 and

2045
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:29,320
the Odroid XU3 and 4 so there's you know and cue boxes and stuff so it's quite an interesting

2046
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:36,800
project in that the the main OS is it's just bulletproof I mean it just runs and runs and

2047
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:40,800
runs I've never had any problem with it and I've used it at work as well I've used it

2048
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:46,080
for file servers in offices and stuff like that hmm now the big question though can I

2049
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:57,780
use butter FS only if you're insane all right well very good I will put I'm I am I think

2050
01:49:57,780 --> 01:50:01,740
irrationally excited about the possibility of rebuilding we're setting up and picking

2051
01:50:01,740 --> 01:50:05,920
a new file server right figuring out how I'm gonna do all of this but I'll check back in

2052
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:09,840
at the end of the day for Linux users here and it's just really exciting to be like yeah

2053
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:14,640
free I can do it and it solves a real problem and stuff like open media vault didn't really

2054
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:19,040
exist the last time I really gave us a thorough look a few years ago like it just wasn't there

2055
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:24,700
and free nas was an option but so everything has changed which makes it all new and exciting

2056
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:30,440
again that does bring us to the end of this week's broadcast thank you to everybody who

So I get your you're traveling up to the Pacific Northwest.

2066
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:47,080
Oh what.

2067
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:51,720
Yeah I'm going to be in Portland well I'm leaving on Saturday so I'm going to be out

2068
01:51:51,720 --> 01:51:55,240
there and I'm going to be out in Hillsborough a lot as well for work going to be there for

2069
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:56,240
two weeks.

2070
01:51:56,240 --> 01:51:57,240
Hmm.

2071
01:51:57,240 --> 01:51:58,240
Oh really.

2072
01:51:58,240 --> 01:51:59,240
Two weeks is a nice window.

2073
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:00,720
Yeah are you going to have a vehicle.

2074
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:01,720
Are you.

2075
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:02,720
Do you have a means of.

2076
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:06,080
I am not unfortunately but you know there's methods.

2077
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:09,440
There may be there may be there because we have we have a fair amount of listeners in

2078
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:14,540
Portland because here's the thing West is what do you think the J.B. one studios from

2079
01:52:14,540 --> 01:52:17,320
Portland that's about it what three hour drive.

2080
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:21,120
Yeah depends on traffic but if we do it at the right time yeah three hours we should

2081
01:52:21,120 --> 01:52:22,120
be there.

2082
01:52:22,120 --> 01:52:23,120
Yeah interesting.

2083
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:24,120
That'd be fun Nike.

2084
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:25,120
That would be a lot of fun.

2085
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:26,120
That would be too much fun.

2086
01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:33,880
Because what I want personally from you yeah so it's these kind of the whole user story

2087
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:39,880
thing and so I kind of like to get your views there and then a solid as opposed to you know

2088
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:44,360
like via text or you know remotely over the internet so you can just tell me to be faces

2089
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:51,040
like this is a heap of shit you bollocks fix it you know hardcore user test case I see.

2090
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:52,040
Yeah.

2091
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:53,040
Hmm.

2092
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:54,040
Wow.

2093
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:55,200
So how far out is that.

2094
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:57,040
Two weeks are you going to be there going to be here for two weeks.

2095
01:52:57,040 --> 01:52:58,040
How far out.

2096
01:52:58,040 --> 01:52:59,040
So I'm leaving on Saturday.

2097
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:03,920
I'm going to be I'm going to be getting burgers that night because it's the end of the burger

2098
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:04,920
week isn't it.

2099
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:08,800
So I'm going to be getting me burgers that night then there for a whole two weeks.

2100
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:16,240
Yeah I'll be staying in Portland downtown hanging with Linus actually met him in Dublin

2101
01:53:16,240 --> 01:53:21,920
last year I was presenting that Linux Con Europe so I saw him out the back there.

2102
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,920
Yeah.

2103
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:23,920
Yeah.

2104
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:24,920
Linux Con is the place.

2105
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:26,960
If you get to meet him that's usually the place to do it.

2106
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:29,280
He doesn't otherwise really like to attend.

2107
01:53:29,280 --> 01:53:34,360
Well we also have conferences at work as well because my office is the Intel Jones well when

2108
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:38,320
I'm there it's the Intel Jones Farm campus over in Hillsborough.

2109
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:42,640
So we have the conferences up in Washington up in you know Skamania.

2110
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:43,640
Yeah.

2111
01:53:43,640 --> 01:53:44,640
Yeah.

2112
01:53:44,640 --> 01:53:45,960
So like we go up there and he's there as well.

2113
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:49,440
So I've met him there a couple of times but the first time I ever met him like I was kind
