WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.040
Shop dot gnome dot org. I know should I say gnome or gnome?

00:04.040 --> 00:08.840
I you know, I was wondering that when you're referring to a web URL. Do you say?

00:09.580 --> 00:11.580
Do you which one do you say?

00:12.320 --> 00:18.240
Gnome or gun? Oh, I would say gnu but it's just me who cares. They have a merch store and that's all that matters

00:18.240 --> 00:25.160
Hello friends and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hi, Wes. Wow

00:25.840 --> 00:28.760
Did you put those fancy boots on for me? Of course I did

00:28.760 --> 00:31.600
I wanted to welcome you back from your grand adventure. Thank you

00:31.600 --> 00:37.080
It is really great to be back and we have a great show so much to catch up on some more

00:37.080 --> 00:41.720
Fun stuff coming up in the next episode. So stay tuned for more fun stuff coming up in the next episode

00:41.720 --> 00:48.200
Adventure. Thank you. It is really great to be back and we have a great show so much to catch up on some

00:48.800 --> 00:54.000
Solid feedback and some great picks this week. It's a real classic and before we get any further

00:54.000 --> 00:59.080
I want to say hello to drew and cheese. Hello, gentlemen. Thanks for being here. Well, hello there. Hello

00:59.240 --> 01:04.520
Hey, you both are also quite dressed up cheese. I don't think I've ever seen you in a suit before and the bowtie

01:04.520 --> 01:10.280
I know dude, it's weird. Yeah, I actually think the bowtie is working. I think it's working drew in a tie though

01:10.280 --> 01:13.720
That's gonna take some getting used to but you're supposed to put it around your neck

01:13.720 --> 01:16.040
Not your forehead drew also before we go

01:16.040 --> 01:23.320
I have to say a huge hello a hearty time appropriate greetings to our mumble room. Hello virtual lug. Hello

01:25.320 --> 01:28.360
Tuesday happy Linux Tuesday to y'all and

01:28.880 --> 01:30.880
It's true. I'm I'm back

01:31.320 --> 01:37.360
Back in the Pacific Northwest. It's really nice to be back in the studio. It was about 5,000 miles

01:37.360 --> 01:40.560
almost 50 days of traveling

01:41.160 --> 01:47.960
Tricky keeping everyone healthy and safe during all of that while also visiting family and working and of course

01:48.400 --> 01:52.080
Trying to also make it a memorable experience for the kids and do the shows

01:52.160 --> 01:56.320
this is a lot, but it was maybe one of the

01:57.000 --> 02:02.120
greatest road trips of our family's lifetime, so I really enjoyed it and

02:03.080 --> 02:05.880
awesomely while I was out and about

02:05.880 --> 02:09.560
Angela managed to get the roof replaced on the studio

02:09.560 --> 02:15.680
So we got some really really important work done for the studio that we've been needing to do for a long time

02:16.560 --> 02:18.560
Taken care of while I was out for so long

02:18.760 --> 02:25.760
So that's pretty great big old thanks to and for pulling that off because I never would have got it done

02:25.760 --> 02:29.560
No, or you would have scheduled it for the same day. We were doing a Linux unplugged

02:29.560 --> 02:31.560
So there would have been roofing noises in the recording

02:32.160 --> 02:34.080
Yeah, that was really the strategy of it

02:34.080 --> 02:38.560
But now that I'm back, I don't know. I guess I was I was so stupid

02:38.560 --> 02:41.700
I thought I would I don't know

02:41.700 --> 02:48.300
I would spend 50 days on the road and I would be in such different conditions that when I got back I wouldn't have

02:49.400 --> 02:54.080
RSI, but within a couple of hours of sitting back at my desk. I

02:54.840 --> 02:56.240
was having

02:56.240 --> 03:03.240
Significant bad RSI again. I mean seriously from my fingertips into my wrists into my elbows all the way up to my shoulders. There's

03:03.240 --> 03:07.040
intense pain and I I have trouble now holding stuff

03:07.720 --> 03:12.960
so I need some RSI tips from the audience because I was trying to pretend like this was gonna go away if I just

03:12.960 --> 03:14.960
changed things up for a bit and

03:15.120 --> 03:19.800
it's like even now I haven't really done I've tried not to be at my desk a ton this morning and

03:20.560 --> 03:22.720
My hands are stiff and sore

03:24.080 --> 03:26.120
Exercises anything people could give because you know

03:26.120 --> 03:27.800
This is starting to freak me out because I'm worried

03:27.800 --> 03:31.760
I'm not gonna be able to use the computer for more than an hour at a time without hurting myself

03:31.760 --> 03:34.520
so I mean I've had issues and I know that

03:35.440 --> 03:41.440
Previously, I was really bad about putting my elbow on my desk and then like resting my chin on my elbow

03:41.520 --> 03:44.440
Yeah, I do that on my armchair. That's really bad

03:45.160 --> 03:51.320
but you know one one suggestion I would say is get yourself a motorized desk where you can stand and then

03:51.920 --> 03:56.680
Alternate between sitting and standing. I do that about every hour hour and a half

03:57.280 --> 04:01.640
You know sit down for an hour and a half stand up for an hour and a half and that seems to help out a lot

04:01.640 --> 04:07.240
you cannot buy any personal fitness stuff on Amazon really right now because of the pandemic, but

04:08.200 --> 04:10.200
you can pick up a

04:10.360 --> 04:14.280
It's like an elastic band set that you just throw over the door

04:14.280 --> 04:18.640
And then that way you can do like a couple of you know, like different kind of strokes

04:19.320 --> 04:22.480
Using these bands and it'll help out a lot, too

04:22.480 --> 04:27.800
It'll strengthen all the muscles that are kind of in the front of your chest and down your arms and your biceps and help out

04:27.800 --> 04:34.040
a little bit so that's helped me out a lot, but you know ultimately I did have to have a surgery

04:34.480 --> 04:37.480
Related to my neck and I don't know if it's connected to that

04:37.480 --> 04:39.800
We're not years of being at a computer desk

04:39.800 --> 04:44.120
But it certainly could be Neil some of us Linux users are just aging a bit

04:44.200 --> 04:47.760
Think it's gonna be something that happens to a lot of us. Is this something you've struggled with?

04:47.800 --> 04:52.840
I've dealt with this quite a lot. It got much worse once I started working from home

04:52.840 --> 04:57.880
because my setup at home is not optimized for

04:58.600 --> 05:01.320
Continuously doing the same kinds of things I do at work

05:01.320 --> 05:06.240
It's actually more optimized for me to just sit and play games, right? Yeah chill

05:06.320 --> 05:11.040
My desk is actually a little too tall. So typing is like quite painful

05:11.040 --> 05:14.960
so a couple of things that I wound up doing the first was I

05:14.960 --> 05:21.600
I did some awful work to slightly lower my desk a little bit so that the height wasn't

05:21.920 --> 05:26.560
exactly at eye level for me for the because my my I have no stands or

05:27.240 --> 05:32.800
Auxiliary whatever's but like getting my keyboard to be lower so that I don't always have to like prop up

05:33.200 --> 05:35.840
My arms to type helped

05:36.640 --> 05:40.720
Also getting a very soft wrist rest across the whole keyboard

05:40.720 --> 05:45.800
So that whenever I'm typing it can rest and not feel like I'm digging into my wrists

05:46.520 --> 05:49.560
Having an ergonomic keyboard making sure you have a good wrist rest

05:50.000 --> 05:55.680
Actually making that making it so that you don't have to prop up your arms to like type on your keyboard

05:55.680 --> 05:57.680
It also makes it so that you have less

05:58.240 --> 06:04.760
You're less likely to like dig into and put pressure across everything at least in my experience that has made it better again

06:04.760 --> 06:09.600
Not medical professional, please go seek a doctor but so that's helped for me

06:09.600 --> 06:14.000
It's kind of fascinating. It just makes me think about when I was a youngster taking piano lessons

06:14.000 --> 06:19.320
And you know you got to learn the proper form and despite many of us being professionals or just hobbyists

06:19.440 --> 06:22.560
Either way spending all of our time sitting at the computer

06:22.560 --> 06:26.360
We don't think that we need to invest in that and you know get the forms, right?

06:26.360 --> 06:31.200
If we're gonna be doing it all the time. I wish I had taken it seriously sooner

06:31.720 --> 06:34.480
because it's gotten to the point where I

06:34.880 --> 06:39.160
Was out doing some yard work in the junkyard just because while I was gone it turned into a jungle

06:39.160 --> 06:43.800
And even 15 minutes of holding the whacker thingy

06:44.400 --> 06:46.800
My elbow was was done for the night

06:47.440 --> 06:52.280
It was really it just stinks like so I got to get ahead of it or or at least I I mean

06:52.280 --> 06:54.280
Maybe I'm not ahead of anymore, but I got to do something about it

06:54.880 --> 06:56.280
anyways, I

06:56.280 --> 07:01.320
just wanted to put it out there because I think a lot of us who are into Linux are very intense about the amount of

07:01.320 --> 07:03.800
time we spend at the keyboard and I

07:04.200 --> 07:06.440
do want to try to get the word out there because I

07:06.440 --> 07:12.440
I think one of these it's one of these things if you don't take care of it before it starts once it starts you're at a

07:13.000 --> 07:19.280
Basically a stage of mitigating and managing it from that point forward instead of preventing or curing it. Maybe I'm wrong

07:19.840 --> 07:24.320
That seems to be what I'm discovering moving on though because we have some really good news

07:24.320 --> 07:29.380
And that's jellyfin has a brand new release that looks pretty great in general

07:29.380 --> 07:35.200
But one thing that Wes and I both noticed is it introduces a new feature called sync play

07:35.200 --> 07:41.360
sync play allows you to create a room that other users can join in order to share

07:42.160 --> 07:47.800
Essentially a common viewing experience and there seems to be no limit on the number of users in a room

07:47.800 --> 07:49.680
You're all free to join its jellyfin

07:49.680 --> 07:56.640
so there wasn't there's a login but you can share that same user account or you could be the same user on multiple devices and

07:57.680 --> 08:00.800
We had a chance to try it out this morning. Yeah, we did

08:00.800 --> 08:07.360
I mean, this is something that both you and I have been looking for it. Now. There's various solutions for there's a there's a plugin system

08:07.360 --> 08:12.120
For VLC there's stuff for Netflix. There's stuff for YouTube, but none of them really kind of hit the sweet spot

08:12.200 --> 08:16.560
I think jellyfin sync play is getting close because you and I were able to watch

08:17.160 --> 08:22.320
Co watch an episode of Picard this morning. I guess I should maybe step back if you're not familiar with jellyfin

08:22.320 --> 08:24.320
It's a media management

08:24.920 --> 08:30.400
System for your videos it indexes them it goes out and gets the metadata a lot like Plex one thing

08:30.400 --> 08:33.640
I like is it's you know, it's it's just a little more lightweight Plex is amazing

08:33.640 --> 08:37.380
Don't get me wrong, but you know, it's it's tied into the company. It's tied into the web servers

08:38.120 --> 08:42.280
Jellyfin was forked off MB and you know, you just start up the doctor container get it going

08:42.280 --> 08:44.760
You can make a guest account. You can make local user account

08:44.760 --> 08:49.320
so it's really easy to share with people even if they're not totally bought into the whole

08:49.760 --> 08:54.480
Ecosystem and now the supports getting way better. It works with the Chromecast

08:54.480 --> 08:57.720
I don't think it has integration with many of the clients yet

08:57.720 --> 09:01.440
But hopefully that will that will come down the road and really a huge

09:01.440 --> 09:06.960
Thank you both from from me from Chris and I think from the jellyfin community to first-time contributor

09:07.320 --> 09:12.240
Andre Hanka, who's a computer science student over at a university in Italy

09:12.440 --> 09:19.200
He submitted pull requests for both the server changes and the web client changes that laid the foundations for all of this

09:19.200 --> 09:25.540
And I think it's a really cool open source success story because they've actually been like a feature request for something like this feature

09:25.540 --> 09:31.320
Since all the way back till like 2018 and it just took someone stepping up

09:31.820 --> 09:34.980
Doing the work putting it in and then the project was you know

09:34.980 --> 09:38.700
Happy to include it and actually shipped it out where we can all go test it and abuse it

09:38.700 --> 09:39.180
Yeah

09:39.180 --> 09:44.820
And the timing is pretty good right because this is a time when people maybe would get together and watch something that are now

09:45.260 --> 09:47.820
Spending time apart, but there's still

09:48.580 --> 09:53.260
options like this to do some kind of remote viewing party and

09:53.260 --> 09:59.500
The great thing is is there wasn't something that was free software and readily available and didn't require cloud services

09:59.760 --> 10:03.660
Until this came along so I'm really glad the jellyfin project proceeded

10:04.100 --> 10:10.580
With implementing this because I know there was some people in the community thought oh, maybe this isn't something we should really do

10:10.580 --> 10:13.980
We don't think we can get it right, but I'm here to tell you it works pretty well

10:14.100 --> 10:19.980
Wes and I were pretty quick to get it set up and going we both had control over the player

10:19.980 --> 10:23.820
We could skip ahead and skip back play pause and it worked really well

10:23.820 --> 10:26.540
It seems like one of the little tricks they do is when you skip ahead

10:26.540 --> 10:32.660
They pause the playback for everyone which probably gives the players time to sync up and then when you hit play by then

10:32.660 --> 10:35.940
They've already kind of figured out their positioning and it picks right back up

10:36.180 --> 10:42.380
When you consider how far apart folks might be the various latencies introduced between locations and how close you are to the actual server

10:42.500 --> 10:43.660
It's pretty impressive

10:43.660 --> 10:49.500
There were a few little details that you kind of have to get used to and I did find in my own testing that you know

10:49.500 --> 10:53.820
If someone's watching something you join in the sink will be a little a little rougher

10:53.820 --> 10:56.980
But once you've paused and then resumed playback, it was really tight

10:57.020 --> 11:04.860
Yeah, and we immediately just started chatting in a separate text chat about the show. We were watching there's no chat aspect to it

11:04.860 --> 11:07.100
So you provide that separately and I like that?

11:07.100 --> 11:13.220
I don't want them to try to integrate some sort of web RTC voice chat into this thing

11:13.500 --> 11:17.500
Just focus on the video playback and we'll use the existing communications channel

11:17.500 --> 11:19.500
We already had to set the whole thing up in the first place

11:20.060 --> 11:26.340
There's also just traditional improvements. They're working on a more modern web client

11:26.340 --> 11:32.580
It's it's had a lot of technical debt. It's really kind of just coming from a fork of MB and then implementing it themselves

11:32.580 --> 11:35.660
There's just old technologies in there at this point

11:35.660 --> 11:39.980
so some of those until recently prevented them from being able to use modern JavaScript tooling which

11:40.620 --> 11:46.740
They have taken a whacking to thanks to a contributor who worked on improving the way they build the web client

11:46.740 --> 11:49.700
They can now get to some of this also Wes

11:49.700 --> 11:51.700
It looks like some of this

11:52.060 --> 11:58.420
greatly simplifies the support for some of their legacy clients and the reason why that's sort of notable is that means they could

11:58.580 --> 12:03.660
Extend support back to web OS and Tizen versions of the client

12:03.660 --> 12:08.420
And I just love that because if you've got devices like that laying around and they have the means to make it work

12:08.420 --> 12:10.940
I think it's pretty great to see them put the effort into it

12:10.940 --> 12:13.620
Yeah, you know once you've got some of this additional tooling available

12:13.620 --> 12:20.820
That means you can target older versions of JavaScript, you know other ancient clients that they still have the hardware to do it

12:20.820 --> 12:22.860
They just don't support the latest standards

12:22.860 --> 12:27.020
But with a tooling cleanup now that can be a lot better and actually, you know

12:27.020 --> 12:31.900
This is a pretty big change. Once it's complete. It should make the web client a lot simpler

12:31.900 --> 12:36.340
I already think the web clients I mean pretty decent although you can tell there's some rough edges

12:36.960 --> 12:43.400
Sounds like eventually jellyfin wants to migrate over to view one of the hot new JavaScript frameworks and really just you know

12:43.400 --> 12:48.340
Do a good summer cleaning of all this code that they've inherited lots of good stuff

12:48.660 --> 12:49.780
Lots of old stuff

12:49.780 --> 12:52.500
But if you want it to be shiny and fast and new

12:52.740 --> 12:56.900
You got to make sure you tackle that technical debt and it's really nice to see the project trying to take that on

12:56.900 --> 12:59.740
It still feels like there's more to be done in that area

13:00.900 --> 13:03.380
significant work to be done in that area, but

13:04.020 --> 13:07.020
They're really making it attractive and if you've thought about Plex

13:07.020 --> 13:11.880
But you're not comfortable with it for whatever reason take a look at jellyfin. We'll have a link in the show notes

13:11.880 --> 13:17.880
Well, let's change gears and talk about Proxmox. Proxmox is an enterprise class

13:18.600 --> 13:23.260
Virtualization system based on Linux. I used to use it in the studio

13:23.940 --> 13:26.300
Now we run on arch and just put it all in containers

13:26.460 --> 13:32.340
But I really like Proxmox and it's developed nicely over the years and this last week

13:32.340 --> 13:37.500
They announced the Proxmox backup server. This will be an enterprise grade

13:37.500 --> 13:42.740
Backup server for your virtual machines containers and the physical hosts

13:42.740 --> 13:48.740
It is specifically optimized for the Proxmox virtual environment platform and allows you to back up and replicate

13:49.100 --> 13:55.580
the data from that platform securely and it has easy management and command-line tools got a web user interface as well and

13:56.540 --> 14:01.260
It's licensed under the GNU a GPL version 3. Hey, those are all good things

14:01.260 --> 14:08.860
Other good things about the Proxmox backup setup and especially on the server side is that it supports incremental backups

14:09.420 --> 14:11.860
deduplication compression and authenticated encryption

14:12.620 --> 14:17.160
Plus Chris you'll love uses rust as the implementation language

14:17.160 --> 14:23.440
So that there's good performance and low resource usage and maybe a high quality code base time will tell on that one

14:23.860 --> 14:27.980
It also has strong encryption on the client side. Hey, that's where you want it

14:27.980 --> 14:33.200
So you can back up to something you might not fully trust what I love about rust is

14:33.380 --> 14:39.260
It's used to sell a tool as production grade just because you name drop rust. Have you noticed that? Yeah

14:39.260 --> 14:43.220
I don't know that that's really fair because any new code base is likely to have bugs

14:43.560 --> 14:46.340
Even if you have an amazing compiler like you do with rust

14:46.340 --> 14:46.780
Yeah

14:46.780 --> 14:52.300
But then again if you were to come to me and say hey Chris if you want us to build some really nice high-performance

14:52.300 --> 14:59.220
Low-level enterprise grade tools. What language do we write it in? I'd probably say rust and here I thought you like to see plus-plus

15:01.780 --> 15:07.180
All right, well that concludes the rust watch for this episode, you know, I'm not a huge Proxmox user

15:07.180 --> 15:09.180
But I do know a lot of folks who found it useful

15:09.820 --> 15:11.620
You know, maybe you don't like the license

15:11.620 --> 15:15.060
Maybe you just don't like the tooling but it gives access to a lot of the you know

15:15.060 --> 15:20.020
Ecosystem that we talked about here on Linux unplugged and I just like seeing in general

15:20.020 --> 15:21.820
Making backups easier for folks, right?

15:21.820 --> 15:25.540
If you're gonna have to go do it yourself or learn a whole bunch while that might be valuable

15:25.540 --> 15:32.500
It might also mean delaying taking those backups. So if you can just integrate with you know with these new features, that's great

15:32.500 --> 15:35.100
Yeah, I wish we had a reason to use it here

15:35.100 --> 15:37.140
Like if that arch box would screw up a whole bunch

15:37.140 --> 15:42.900
I'd say we should Proxmox it up if I wasn't all piled up in the RV and with x86

15:42.900 --> 15:46.100
I'd probably use Proxmox underneath whatever I ran

15:46.100 --> 15:50.300
But I just haven't had that use case for it yet

15:50.300 --> 15:53.380
And the reason why it kind of bothers me is I want to talk about it more on the show

15:53.900 --> 15:59.140
Because it's really good and we just don't talk about it enough, but I just haven't quite

15:59.860 --> 16:06.260
Found that use yet before we kind of changed everything up and went on a free NAS tear for a while and all that

16:06.260 --> 16:09.820
We used to use Proxmox to do a lot of what we now do in

16:10.340 --> 16:11.340
containers

16:11.340 --> 16:17.540
But that just made sense to use containers for the types applications we're doing if you have a good use case out there

16:17.540 --> 16:19.540
Let us know linuxonplug.com

16:19.620 --> 16:21.620
slash contact

16:22.340 --> 16:24.340
Alright now for the Microsoft watch

16:24.660 --> 16:30.580
Those crazy cats at Microsoft have released Procmon. No, no, no not that old sis internals one

16:31.140 --> 16:35.260
Procmon for Linux. It's a process monitor tool and it's in preview now

16:35.260 --> 16:42.260
They write process monitor is a Linux reimagining of a classic Procmon tool from sysinternals suite of tools

16:42.260 --> 16:49.620
That were for Windows Procmon provides a convenient and efficient way for Linux developers to trace the syscall activity on the system

16:50.340 --> 16:53.620
And I have to say I was shocked to find

16:54.180 --> 17:00.140
It is not in the AUR at least when I checked yesterday. Wait, what how is that possible?

17:00.140 --> 17:07.220
I I don't know. I don't know not enough ARCH users over at Microsoft. I guess I mean they do have a PPA

17:07.740 --> 17:11.740
Yes, they do. They do. So what do we think about this story?

17:11.740 --> 17:17.260
Is it still a big deal when Microsoft is releasing some of these classic tools as open source on Linux?

17:17.260 --> 17:22.900
It feels to me like kind of routine at this point. I think that means things have really shifted

17:22.900 --> 17:29.140
You know, this would have been huge massive news what two years ago, but just feels like it's been a long time

17:29.140 --> 17:35.420
But just feels like a regular week with some new stuff from Microsoft. So that's kind of how I feel about it

17:35.660 --> 17:36.620
Neil what about you?

17:36.620 --> 17:43.500
What about seeing some of these classic Windows tools that were honestly some of the gems of Windows coming from Microsoft to Linux?

17:43.500 --> 17:47.100
I started on as a Windows developer and I did do

17:47.900 --> 17:49.940
Windows systems administration as well

17:49.940 --> 17:55.380
So like these tools were things that I relied on when I did a lot more Windows stuff when I was younger

17:55.380 --> 18:02.500
It's nice for me to see that these are coming to Linux. I personally relied a lot on Procmon when I did Windows stuff

18:02.540 --> 18:06.260
so when I when I saw it was released, I tried to grab it and build it and

18:06.860 --> 18:12.980
Package it up for Fedora, but alas it actually doesn't build. There's a couple of things wrong with it

18:12.980 --> 18:18.180
They have bundled copies of libraries that don't compile and it tries to fetch stuff from the Internet

18:18.260 --> 18:21.940
Which is a no-go for shipping it in any Linux distribution, right?

18:21.940 --> 18:25.580
I know that a lot of people think this is kind of the good way to do things now

18:25.580 --> 18:27.580
But like it feels real bad

18:27.940 --> 18:35.020
especially from a company like Microsoft who should at this point know the value of reproducibility and stuff like that

18:35.940 --> 18:43.260
And this also kind of showed a little bit of like they don't really get how to make open source software that people can

18:43.660 --> 18:45.580
easily consume because they

18:45.580 --> 18:50.500
They made it so that it's it's just like a bunch of silly putty thrown over the wall

18:50.500 --> 18:53.060
Yeah, I think it's pretty early days. You know, if you look at the commit

18:53.060 --> 18:59.860
It does seem like it's something developed maybe internally not introduced into any sort of build system and just yeah now

18:59.860 --> 19:02.220
It's out there and Neil is that criticism fair?

19:02.820 --> 19:06.820
Holy like if you balance expectations with how large corporations work

19:07.540 --> 19:13.380
Maybe this is the best that's going to get for jumping code over the wall because think about it from this standpoint

19:13.740 --> 19:17.580
this is probably after a long series of discussions about

19:17.580 --> 19:25.340
This strategy this tool how this developer will spend their time and there's even like legal analysis, right?

19:25.340 --> 19:30.940
Like a complete version of the project to an extent that has to probably be reviewed by several parties before they can release it

19:30.940 --> 19:32.940
Sure. Sure. No that that's all good

19:32.940 --> 19:39.020
Well and good, but but Microsoft is not new to this whole trying to release open source software thing

19:39.620 --> 19:42.380
Microsoft today is not a company that I would consider

19:42.380 --> 19:49.180
completely unaware of how you do free software or open source software or whatever term you'd like and

19:49.340 --> 19:52.580
They continue to struggle with this in frustrating ways

19:53.180 --> 19:55.860
with dotnet with MS build and

19:57.300 --> 20:04.400
Monodevelop like they're not new to this it this is something that I expect from somebody who's really new to this and has no

20:04.420 --> 20:07.500
Experts or no people from the community. Yeah

20:07.500 --> 20:11.860
I think it's a fair criticism on how the code is released and that they've had time to adapt

20:11.860 --> 20:16.940
So I follow you there. Let's talk about something that I think those of us on this show

20:16.940 --> 20:22.000
We're pretty pleased to see although we'll wait to see how it ultimately plays out, but it's official

20:22.060 --> 20:28.500
It's been approved for fedora 33 to switch the desktop variants default file system to butter

20:28.500 --> 20:36.460
Fs the fedora engineering and steering committee formally signed off on this which means we're going from extended for to butter fs

20:36.460 --> 20:38.460
Oh my god. Yes

20:38.460 --> 20:43.740
But having it formally approved it all the T's are crossed and all the eyes were dotted

20:44.140 --> 20:47.640
We're now, you know, we're just proceeding forward and getting everything working

20:48.220 --> 20:53.900
Crossing my fingers. We'll actually have it in G in beta and GA. I'm pretty confident

20:53.900 --> 20:55.900
It'll be at least in be a bit in beta. I

20:56.540 --> 21:01.980
have no reason to believe that it won't make it to GA so I am I'm really happy about this and

21:01.980 --> 21:08.700
Man years and years of effort are finally paying off. Well, it is very exciting and congratulations, and I

21:09.420 --> 21:14.620
Thought it was sort of driven home recently because we just got an email from Steven or Stefan

21:14.620 --> 21:16.620
I'm sorry Stefan if I'm getting it wrong

21:16.620 --> 21:21.020
He was upgrading from open Sousa 42.1 to 15.2

21:21.020 --> 21:25.740
And he said butter fs and snapshotting were a total lifesaver

21:26.380 --> 21:29.180
He writes I've never had to start over on my main machine

21:29.180 --> 21:33.420
Anytime I hosed the system by making a big error or an upgrade went awry

21:33.900 --> 21:40.060
I just reboot into an older snapshot and use snapper to roll back once I'm in a working system

21:40.380 --> 21:44.940
Of course the implementations would eventually be different in fedora once it got to that point

21:45.340 --> 21:51.740
But just think about how critical a snapshot and rollback option is for a distribution that is

21:52.540 --> 21:57.420
Updated as frequently as fedora and not just major releases which are frequent

21:57.420 --> 22:04.380
but significant package updates including new versions of the kernel come down while you're running a current release of fedora and

22:05.100 --> 22:09.260
While it generally works really well and dnf is pretty great at catching stuff

22:10.060 --> 22:14.540
There's nothing like that belt and suspenders where you also have the reliability of those snapshots

22:14.780 --> 22:19.420
And I think it makes the risk of upgrading to the next release of fedora even less now

22:19.980 --> 22:26.220
So i'm excited to see where this goes. Yeah, um right now. We're not doing the automatic snapshotting stuff. That's down the road

22:26.220 --> 22:31.980
That's down the road. I'm trying to be methodical about how we how we move forward and integrate these things

22:32.060 --> 22:37.500
Well, it's kind of like I said recently you have to get the file system shipping before you can start building the tools based on

22:37.500 --> 22:42.140
It exactly and like we can take advantage of the lessons learned from open susa

22:42.620 --> 22:45.920
From other companies who have been rolling it out into production on nas devices

22:46.540 --> 22:55.100
In in server fleets and stuff like that and we can hopefully make better decisions and and and optimize for our use case a lot better

22:55.100 --> 23:00.540
With all of this, you know knowledge and experience and that's what i'm hoping to go towards like

23:01.180 --> 23:05.420
Some of the choices that are a little bit weird from my perspective on open susa for their layout

23:05.900 --> 23:09.020
We're probably not going to do those on fedora because we don't need to

23:09.500 --> 23:12.780
Uh, and we're making already some enhancements are coming down the pipeline

23:13.020 --> 23:19.340
There are some patches written for libvert to better handle the creation of virtual machines on butterfs making them no cow

23:20.060 --> 23:24.000
For the disk images is disk image files. So that'll happen automatically

23:24.000 --> 23:28.640
So that means that you won't be impaired by butterfs just out of the gate

23:29.040 --> 23:32.560
Um in that sense and there's other things that we're working on across the board

23:32.800 --> 23:36.960
Things for like improving performance when dealing with sqlite postgres mysql all the things

23:37.360 --> 23:40.480
So like we're we're looking at it. We're actively doing these things

23:41.040 --> 23:43.680
Um, i'm i'm confident. It's going to be a great experience

23:44.160 --> 23:48.160
Um by the time fedora 33 rolls out it won't be like super fancy

23:48.720 --> 23:53.120
The idea is that you won't notice anything, but it'll be there making things better

23:53.120 --> 23:58.000
That's what i'm so excited about is that you know, suddenly without the user having to do anything

23:58.800 --> 24:01.540
You've got all of these additional things like copy and write snapshots

24:02.000 --> 24:05.680
File system compression optimizations for ssds built-in raid

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
You might not need any or all of these

24:08.320 --> 24:13.520
But they're all at your fingertips now and you don't have to know about it before you go install your linux system

24:13.760 --> 24:17.920
You can opt into it later. Yeah, I look forward to trying it in fedora 33 to tell you the truth

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I think it's going to make it an exciting release

24:20.000 --> 24:25.840
Just because of this even though nothing really fancy is going to happen and it's pretty much transparent to the user

24:26.240 --> 24:30.400
I'm still looking forward to it and wes while we're shucking and jiving about fedora

24:30.800 --> 24:35.920
One of the things we liked about the previous release was they shipped a user space out of memory killer

24:36.400 --> 24:42.080
Which in our testing actually made a significant difference if you're on a linux box with some memory pressure

24:42.640 --> 24:44.480
and now it seems

24:44.480 --> 24:46.480
That this is going to be built into

24:46.480 --> 24:54.480
System d yes, you guessed it because of course it will now I believe this is actually uh, some of the

24:54.880 --> 25:02.080
Original code that was developed by facebook, right? Yes system d o m d is the out of memory demon developed by facebook

25:02.560 --> 25:04.560
And now system d developers

25:04.960 --> 25:09.840
They're aiming for this to be better linux handling of out of memory or just low memory situations

25:10.160 --> 25:13.360
And while facebook originally wrote this code for their servers

25:13.360 --> 25:18.320
And it's continued to be refined and adapted so that now it works pretty well on desktops, too

25:18.560 --> 25:24.000
Now neil do we notice this likely mean that fedora will stop using their version and switch to this

25:24.320 --> 25:29.520
I've been keeping a close eye on this as I told you when we were putting early oom into fedora

25:30.640 --> 25:35.120
Last release cycle. We were actually also tracking this this this came up as part of it

25:35.680 --> 25:37.680
Things are actually moving faster than I expected

25:37.680 --> 25:44.080
Like I originally expected that uh system d oom d would not land for another eight months

25:44.400 --> 25:46.640
And it looks like it might land in a few weeks

25:47.200 --> 25:52.320
So this means that we're probably going to start looking at it in fedora 34. That makes sense

25:52.960 --> 25:58.960
Wes one of the things that's kind of neat about having it down there at the system d level is it's also c group aware

25:59.280 --> 26:07.040
Yeah system d o m d pulls system d for out of memory enabled c groups to monitor them and then kill based on memory pressure

26:07.040 --> 26:11.920
Which is that that new measure that facebook helped add to the kernel or swap usage?

26:12.160 --> 26:14.160
So I think it'll be interesting to see you know

26:14.800 --> 26:18.960
If this solution that is already in place or this new system d based solution

26:19.200 --> 26:23.040
I wonder if that might find different use cases that work a little bit better, especially, you know

26:23.120 --> 26:25.120
It does say this works well for the desktop

26:25.440 --> 26:26.880
But in the facebook world, you know

26:26.880 --> 26:31.280
They could opt into all this stuff make sure that all their utilities on the server side were playing nicely with c groups

26:31.280 --> 26:36.880
It may vary a little bit on desktop environments, uh, how well all this stuff works?

26:38.880 --> 26:41.840
Why don't we stop now and do a little housekeeping just to change it up a bit

26:42.400 --> 26:45.600
Because that was a lot of information to go through i'm out of memory

26:46.480 --> 26:50.640
Yeah, and we're gonna kill it right now. Uh, I don't want to get the word out about guatic 2020

26:50.800 --> 26:56.640
It starts july 22nd, which is tomorrow as we record this and goes to the 28th of 2020

26:56.640 --> 27:02.560
The guatic is the gnome community's largest conference and it's online this year. So I would imagine

27:03.360 --> 27:07.360
This could be the first guatic I ever attended if I had given it any thought and maybe I still can

27:07.840 --> 27:10.800
Uh, i'll look into that and you can too with the link in the show notes

27:11.040 --> 27:16.340
Also, if you want to join us live you'll find out when did you know that calendar jupitabroadcasting.com

27:16.700 --> 27:20.900
Slash calendar link for that's in the notes as well and we do it over jblive.tv

27:20.900 --> 27:27.380
Every sunday the lup lug the folks in the mumble room get together and hang out at noon pacific

27:27.460 --> 27:30.900
That's the same bat time. We do this show. It's just on a bat sunday

27:31.540 --> 27:37.540
We hung out last sunday. I talked about how I reflashed the computer in my rv for more performance and uh,

27:37.860 --> 27:39.860
It made for some good stories

27:40.420 --> 27:46.340
Uh lots of good stuff. We had some new folks show up. Of course as always we talk a little butter fs

27:46.580 --> 27:48.580
so the lup lug is

27:48.580 --> 27:52.900
It's often a multi-hour event, but you can show up for as little or as much as you like

27:53.460 --> 27:57.220
Every sunday at noon pacific. It's also on the calendar if you just want to check that

27:57.780 --> 27:59.780
so we'd love to see you there and

28:00.820 --> 28:02.820
I've made it easier than ever

28:03.060 --> 28:07.380
To get the mumble server info. You just go to linux unplug.com slash mumble

28:07.940 --> 28:09.700
And it's all there the quick stuff

28:09.700 --> 28:15.060
Or there's a link at the top of the page and the extended guide is still available at the jupiter colony page

28:15.060 --> 28:19.940
If you want the full thing if you're brand new to mumble and you you want a guide on how to set up all the audio

28:19.940 --> 28:25.860
Interface stuff the full guide is still available. But if you just need the quick server info linux unplug dot com

28:26.420 --> 28:28.420
slash mumble

28:30.260 --> 28:34.660
There we go see that doesn't that feel better west so much cleaner in here

28:35.060 --> 28:40.900
And did you put an air freshener in the studio? Yeah, that's just levi. I gave him a shower. Yeah, he's much better now

28:40.900 --> 28:46.820
So let's talk about element. This is something we've been watching really closely the riot chat

28:47.380 --> 28:55.220
Program and the company actually has been renamed to element, which is a matrix chat

28:55.700 --> 29:01.300
Client element, which I don't know if that's any easier to google than vector. I guess we'll see

29:01.860 --> 29:07.700
It's the new flagship secure collaboration app for the decentralized matrix communication network

29:07.700 --> 29:14.660
Element lets you own your end-to-end encrypted chat server. Well still connecting to everyone else in the wider matrix network

29:14.900 --> 29:20.260
Yeah, that's right. That's the big federation play. We did know this name change was in the works

29:20.580 --> 29:22.100
They explained it

29:22.100 --> 29:26.980
Um, even a few weeks ago mostly in a in a blog post talking about some of the issues they had with

29:27.300 --> 29:30.660
Gigantic game companies who blocked them from being able to trademark the name

29:30.980 --> 29:36.660
Which then had a knock-on effect of them being unable to go after abusive forks in the google play store

29:36.660 --> 29:40.580
And it just essentially came down to also being associated with

29:41.300 --> 29:44.340
Violence rather than a more constructive form of chaos that they're into

29:45.300 --> 29:49.940
As they write on their blog, and I think that's nice because the name doesn't really matter in the end

29:49.940 --> 29:50.900
I got used to riot

29:50.900 --> 29:55.700
I'll get used to element and I think it's great because they've also renamed the company now to just sort of keep it simple

29:55.860 --> 29:59.140
Right. It's a little more consistent and you're right. We just got to we got to get used to these things

29:59.140 --> 30:02.340
You had to put a label and naming is hard. Don't we all know it?

30:02.340 --> 30:06.580
It's the worst part about coming up with a new podcast is coming up with the name. It's the worst

30:07.060 --> 30:10.820
Uh, they said they wanted to future proof it as well. So this is their rationale for it

30:10.820 --> 30:15.800
They said as matrix.org announced last month p2p matrix is in heavy development

30:16.420 --> 30:23.380
And we see a world where element will literally be an element of matrix running your own home server within the app

30:23.700 --> 30:29.380
So you can communicate if you don't have a server or even internet that actually is pretty cool

30:29.380 --> 30:34.600
That is really cool. And that's one of the things, you know, the whole matrix ecosystem is filled with fascinating ideas

30:34.900 --> 30:40.980
And a lot of potential the math names. I kind of love too. Hmm, and they're not just doing name changes west

30:41.220 --> 30:46.420
They're rolling out pretty big improvements on their mobile apps and a massive refresh

30:46.980 --> 30:49.780
To their web ui, which looks really good

30:50.500 --> 30:56.180
I am seriously eyeballing matrix right now as the chat platform for jupiter broadcasting

30:56.180 --> 31:02.340
The telegram group is still going jupiter broadcasting.com slash telegram. We haven't plugged it a lot recently because i've kind of just been

31:03.060 --> 31:09.460
Watching how the chat ecosystem is unfolding because for self-hosted and the unfilter show

31:10.100 --> 31:16.100
Discord has been very successful. So that gave me pause. I didn't want to just write discord off

31:16.980 --> 31:21.380
But at the same time when I look at what would be a proper fit with this show

31:21.380 --> 31:28.020
When I look at what would be a proper fit with this show, I think something like matrix which interconnects to all the different platforms

31:28.020 --> 31:32.020
Which is the kind of thing our audience can geek out on but also it's free and open source

31:33.140 --> 31:34.180
and

31:34.180 --> 31:35.700
It's self-hostable

31:35.700 --> 31:43.140
All these things sort of stack my general bias towards matrix as a chat platform that would potentially replace irc and telegram

31:43.620 --> 31:48.500
And we would just use this for all of our primary text-based communication with the community

31:49.300 --> 31:50.900
But at the same time

31:50.900 --> 31:58.580
there's that network effect to consider so I have to look at things very seriously like irc telegram and discord and so i've been

31:59.220 --> 32:07.380
Keeping an eye on matrix for a while and sort of mentally doing the math on how it would play into a wider ecosystem for us

32:08.340 --> 32:15.700
And with element now making these improvements to the web ui and the mobile clients you have the general connected nature of matrix

32:15.700 --> 32:22.580
And this new p2p stuff they're working on I find that to be a really compelling package all in we need it to be easy

32:22.740 --> 32:25.220
Frankly, you know, it's got to be it's got to be worth the install

32:25.300 --> 32:27.860
So the client can't be gross you got to be easy to connect with us

32:28.500 --> 32:35.700
When you live in a world of so many solutions, that's how you differentiate. So elements of thing now no longer will be called riot

32:36.340 --> 32:40.660
Now I don't really have much to say about this last one. It's just a little weird

32:41.300 --> 32:43.960
There's a job posting over at microsoft's

32:43.960 --> 32:45.960
jobs page

32:45.960 --> 32:47.960
about a program manager

32:48.360 --> 32:50.600
for a cloud pc project

32:51.480 --> 32:53.640
That would be a desktop delivered

32:54.440 --> 33:00.680
From azure and managed by microsoft at a flat per user price

33:01.320 --> 33:03.960
They call it the microsoft cloud pc

33:04.520 --> 33:10.520
A new offering that would be built on top of the windows virtual desktop to deliver desktop as a service

33:10.520 --> 33:17.420
It would really be targeted to business customers that are looking for a modern quick workstation experience that have high connectivity

33:18.120 --> 33:20.120
And I have to tell you

33:20.280 --> 33:26.440
I could see this being appealing because I know of companies that sell versions of this based on aws right now

33:27.000 --> 33:29.400
and you go into the businesses and

33:30.040 --> 33:36.120
They don't have any on-premises services other than a switch a router and a wi-fi access point. There's no file server

33:36.200 --> 33:38.200
There's no directory server

33:38.200 --> 33:42.440
It's just a flat network that provides high-speed internet access

33:42.520 --> 33:45.880
And I think you can hear that in the first sentence of that description that you read there that

33:46.440 --> 33:50.840
This is the azure and microsoft managed solution that this already exists

33:50.840 --> 33:55.480
And yeah, clearly it's interesting because as anyone who's administered windows pcs knows

33:56.280 --> 34:02.200
It's kind of a pain and if you can just let microsoft handle it if you already have to be an internet connected company anyway

34:02.200 --> 34:06.300
From all the other sas products that you buy that makes your company run in 2020

34:06.300 --> 34:09.820
Yeah, all right. Why not use the desktop and maybe maybe

34:10.300 --> 34:13.420
Microsoft can do this better than others since they control all the pieces

34:13.900 --> 34:21.420
What's funny is I know that linux has all of the pieces to do this because I rocked linux terminal servers way back in the day

34:22.460 --> 34:28.380
And we have all kinds of means to accomplish this now and there are companies out there working on it. But

34:29.100 --> 34:31.660
Where microsoft is going to have this this sort of?

34:32.700 --> 34:34.700
home turf advantage

34:34.700 --> 34:39.180
Is they're going to sort of package it all up with microsoft's office 365 offering

34:39.740 --> 34:43.420
which it's it's sort of like this obvious solution you have

34:44.300 --> 34:49.100
All your data in the ecosystem of office 365 word excel teams

34:49.500 --> 34:52.860
One drive is your storage or teams. It's weird and

34:53.580 --> 34:58.860
You just need essentially a chrome pc, but instead of getting that google stuff

34:58.860 --> 35:02.700
That's all connected to the google ecosystem. You get microsoft's version of it

35:02.700 --> 35:06.060
You get microsoft's version of it and this one's a step further

35:06.780 --> 35:12.540
And it's maybe even a more pure version of that chrome experience where it's a complete remote cloud pc

35:12.780 --> 35:20.540
Managed by microsoft as part of your office 365 subscription. You know what? I want to know is wsl going to work on cloud pc

35:23.740 --> 35:29.420
Brent i'm sure you'd get one of these wouldn't you? Well, it means maybe I'd I'd need less fancy hardware all the time

35:29.420 --> 35:33.100
But uh, no, I'm sorry. I'm not in my hand is not raised

35:33.420 --> 35:39.500
I would like to see a vendor come along and offer this up with mate as the desktop experience

35:39.900 --> 35:44.540
Libre office as the office solution connected to some sort of central cloud storage

35:44.540 --> 35:50.060
So that way you can have multiple users from a workspace use the same storage

35:50.540 --> 35:53.740
maybe create some sort of user id system for them, I mean there's

35:53.740 --> 36:00.460
Small versions of this have been implemented or there's amazon's implementation of these but there's not a complete

36:00.620 --> 36:06.860
Package of you need office and a computer and you just need these storage services for your company

36:06.860 --> 36:10.860
And here's another alternative for you. That's not google or microsoft the business ready

36:11.420 --> 36:13.420
All wrapped up ready to go stuff

36:13.420 --> 36:13.980
Yeah

36:13.980 --> 36:19.100
And all of the pieces are there and it's something that linux could be particularly good at because I don't know which

36:19.260 --> 36:22.860
System you'd want to use a remote desktop system or a linux terminal services setup

36:22.860 --> 36:25.900
but the cool thing about a linux terminal services setup

36:26.620 --> 36:29.980
is a lot of those programs run locally in memory and

36:30.380 --> 36:36.140
They will use your local gpu if you have one which means you can make thin clients that have gpu acceleration

36:36.140 --> 36:39.820
But additionally if libre office is loaded in your local ram

36:40.300 --> 36:46.860
Your internet can blip or your latency can be bad and you're completely unaffected on a linux thin client setup

36:46.940 --> 36:51.820
Now if you're doing something like xrdp or another type of remote desktop protocol that wouldn't be the case

36:51.820 --> 36:54.940
So it just depends on the implementation, but there's so much opportunity here

36:55.740 --> 36:58.140
it makes me wish I had the time to like start a business because

36:58.940 --> 37:08.460
there is a whole area of small business in the states that is somewhere between five to 25 people and

37:08.860 --> 37:13.580
These annual subscriptions just stack up and they're a little allergic to them

37:13.660 --> 37:19.580
And they just need somebody to show them a solution that works for them and give them an implementation. That's not some sort of

37:19.580 --> 37:26.220
Moral choice they're not choosing microsoft because of some moral reason it's just they don't have any other options presented to them

37:26.460 --> 37:28.780
Right, they have the most hand holding that way and that's what they need

37:29.020 --> 37:32.860
But kudos to microsoft. I think it's probably going to be a successful product if they launch it

37:32.940 --> 37:36.780
They've tried stuff like this in the past, but I think you know now is the time

37:37.100 --> 37:41.260
I wonder if it's you know, we've kind of talked about other microsoft assets like office 365

37:41.260 --> 37:46.140
You know things you used to have to have a windows desktop to use or maybe a complicated wine setup that

37:46.140 --> 37:52.460
Since they've migrated to the cloud into an online offering while we might not love having to use them from the free software world

37:52.780 --> 37:55.740
It's good for people trying to use a linux desktop and still get work done

37:55.900 --> 37:59.900
And I mean this almost seems like it's it's the ultimate in that it's making windows the same thing

38:00.220 --> 38:05.180
I I somewhat recently had to go for an unfortunate reason go spin up a windows vm

38:05.180 --> 38:08.860
And I did it on azure because I didn't want to clutter up any of my local systems

38:09.180 --> 38:13.420
And it was kind of a painful process with all of the pains of using windows

38:13.420 --> 38:19.180
If I could just have a cloud pc pop it up get my windows specific stuff done and then go back to my pure linux world

38:19.660 --> 38:25.900
Yeah, all right. I'll I'll pay microsoft a couple bucks for that. So do you rdp into a azure windows vm?

38:25.900 --> 38:30.060
How does that work? They've got like a web um a way to view it on the web, too

38:30.060 --> 38:33.900
Of course, but yeah, I just rdp'd up uh up in there got my work done

38:34.380 --> 38:36.140
And uh got the heck out of there

38:36.140 --> 38:37.820
But it took forever and of course, you know

38:37.820 --> 38:42.060
I was doing updates and had to spin all the way up and getting it actually installed and booted up took

38:42.060 --> 38:47.980
Much longer than an equivalent linux vm. I was honestly surprised by how painful it was, huh?

38:47.980 --> 38:51.500
That's a that's an interesting experience. Wes. Thanks for sharing that with the class

38:52.220 --> 38:52.780
All right

38:52.780 --> 38:56.780
So if anybody out there knows of a service like this for linux where you could go set up an account

38:57.100 --> 39:00.940
It'll spin you up a virtual desktop and then you can remote desktop into it

39:01.580 --> 39:07.660
Let me know linux unplug.com slash contact or chris lass on twitter because i'll give that a try and I want to give it a review

39:07.660 --> 39:10.460
Because that's a product that should exist for linux desktop as well

39:10.460 --> 39:16.540
We can do it better. Maybe rdp is actually kind of legit, but we can use xrdp. So we could probably do it better

39:18.380 --> 39:21.980
What do you say we do some picks before we get out of here because we got some good ones and we got some

39:22.060 --> 39:28.460
Feedback too and we start with poly bar a fast and easy to use status bar

39:28.780 --> 39:31.580
And I think a couple of you had some experience with this one. Yeah

39:31.580 --> 39:36.620
Well, actually I just stumbled across it the other day and I was thinking to myself man. This would be

39:36.620 --> 39:43.660
A great addition to something like open box or i3 and then after mentioning it to you guys

39:43.660 --> 39:49.600
I believe drew didn't you try it on i3? Yeah, i've used it a number of times on i3

39:50.220 --> 39:53.740
i'm not using it right now, even though i'm on i3 but

39:54.300 --> 39:58.060
It is a really great and good looking bar

39:58.060 --> 40:04.460
That's easy to get going and easy to add like custom blocks and stuff too and change

40:04.460 --> 40:07.260
the way it looks and give it a nice color scheme and

40:08.060 --> 40:14.700
All around it's just a little slicker and more fully featured than you know, the stuff that like comes stock with i3

40:15.340 --> 40:20.540
The orange one's been using it for about a year. So give us the the why i've been using it for a year review

40:21.100 --> 40:27.340
Originally when I started with i3 naturally I found a rust implementation of those bars and it's really nice

40:27.340 --> 40:31.200
But the nice thing about poly bar is there's just tons and tons of extensions

40:31.200 --> 40:40.640
And the fact that you can have it show spotify cpu you see volume time current window. Everything is just great and

40:41.680 --> 40:48.480
Massively like beats like the windows taskbar and what you'd normally expect from a taskbar like that. Hmm

40:49.520 --> 40:54.880
That's a pretty hardy plug. So check out poly bar. We'll have a link in there and then

40:54.880 --> 41:01.920
We have a fun one for those of you who like your stats. It's called y-top and it's essentially go-top

41:02.880 --> 41:05.520
Only this time it's in rust

41:06.400 --> 41:09.200
And you thought we were done with the rust watch heck no

41:11.040 --> 41:12.160
Yes

41:12.160 --> 41:19.200
Another system monitor only this one is written in rust. It's it's familiar to those of you who have been enjoying batchtop

41:19.280 --> 41:21.280
I think we mentioned that in episode

41:21.280 --> 41:26.180
351 so it's been a little bit, but this is another one now. There's go-top out there as well

41:26.500 --> 41:30.580
But this is y-top and yes, it's it's rust based, you know

41:30.580 --> 41:34.980
I think our unofficial goal here on the mix unplugged is to just find every single possible top

41:35.380 --> 41:41.620
Implementation out there and talk about them on the show and i'm interested in what each one chooses to show because yeah

41:41.620 --> 41:45.780
Okay, you're all just going to go scrape the kernel for a whole bunch of information display it for the user

41:45.780 --> 41:51.060
But how you display it that kind of counts and you know y-top. It's a decent contender

41:51.060 --> 41:53.060
It's got a really nice cpu graph going

41:53.140 --> 41:59.060
I also like the network usage graph that it displays because hey right now i'm chatting with you. I can monitor my connection

41:59.380 --> 42:03.860
Yeah, and the hit on the system seems to be very minimal, which is always my thing

42:03.860 --> 42:06.820
I don't want the monitoring tool to put abusive load

42:07.460 --> 42:12.420
On the box, which is really actually kind of an issue on the raspberry pi you you have to be careful

42:12.420 --> 42:15.860
Like on the raspberry pi 3, uh, you could run net data

42:16.500 --> 42:22.020
But it basically will can start consuming the device, especially if you're running off the sd card

42:22.180 --> 42:27.620
But something like this is so much so much lighter. And if you just need quick information over a terminal session

42:28.580 --> 42:33.380
It's hard to a bash top might look a little better, but it's uh, I don't know. It's it's hard to beat this one

42:34.020 --> 42:37.860
I like it a lot. So get a link to those in the notes and

42:37.860 --> 42:42.020
Feel free to send yours along. Why don't we get to a little feedback west? Do you want to take this first one about?

42:42.260 --> 42:46.180
Some next cloud follow-up and questions. Oh boy, eric, aka

42:46.720 --> 42:50.900
Pedestrian had some feedback for us about our recent discussion around next cloud

42:51.460 --> 42:54.260
Hello chris and wess. I really enjoyed the next cloud discussion

42:54.980 --> 42:57.700
But I have a few questions and comments to share

42:58.500 --> 43:04.020
One are you using redis? If not, it might go a long way towards addressing any concurrency issues

43:04.020 --> 43:08.660
You're still seeing. Yes, we are using redis. Although I don't know that we've tuned it a whole bunch

43:08.660 --> 43:12.980
We're using a docker compose stack setup from the next cloud project itself

43:13.140 --> 43:19.620
So we haven't spent a ton of time going outside those bounds, but we are running a redis container. That's a good tip though

43:20.340 --> 43:24.660
Number two using the s3 compatible storage background has been great for me

43:25.140 --> 43:31.380
The interesting part is that any s3 compatible storage provider will work. I've been using redis for a long time

43:31.380 --> 43:37.380
S3 compatible storage provider will work. I've been using a do droplet with wasabi as the back end and it's both cheaper

43:37.780 --> 43:39.780
And more performant than spaces

43:40.500 --> 43:44.740
That's also probably a good tip. You know, we went with spaces because well, we were already a do customer

43:44.740 --> 43:48.340
We had access to it. We had account set up for you know, access to the team all that stuff

43:48.420 --> 43:50.340
So it made sense to plug right in

43:50.340 --> 43:56.180
But the whole beauty of using something that is s3 compatible is you have options there including s3 itself

43:56.180 --> 44:03.140
Of course now i've not used wasabi, but I will say we've received a couple other items of feedback that are also recommending it

44:03.380 --> 44:10.520
Yeah, like rick here writes in and he said in your recent episode when you talked about your expensive next cloud implementation

44:10.980 --> 44:15.060
I found it totally unacceptable. I cringed when I heard the price

44:15.700 --> 44:22.420
This is homework for you and the jb crew to do he says 10 terabytes of hot aka active storage on wasabi's service

44:22.420 --> 44:29.700
Is fifty nine dollars a month combine that with the 15 a month droplet and it should be just about 80 a month

44:30.020 --> 44:31.520
with tax

44:31.520 --> 44:37.780
Overages if any would be much more affordable and manageable can next cloud integrate with wasabi. Hell. Yeah

44:37.940 --> 44:40.260
Here's what I found to get you and the crew started

44:41.540 --> 44:45.060
And he says it also allows you can pick a cdn in front of wasabi

44:45.380 --> 44:51.300
He says I have an idea use the storage on a droplet for temp storage and then move it to wasabi instances as needed

44:51.300 --> 44:54.020
You just figure out a storage strategy and create docs for the crew

44:54.820 --> 44:59.140
Save your hard-earned money. I agree with that. We are going to fix it for the record

44:59.220 --> 45:01.700
I'm not affiliated with wasabi or any storage company

45:03.380 --> 45:07.540
I think this is something we'll have to look at because we're either going to have to stop using it

45:08.100 --> 45:13.060
Or switch to something cheaper and if this math is right, I mean around 80 a month

45:13.940 --> 45:16.600
It's still more expensive than dropbox

45:16.600 --> 45:20.600
But not by much, especially if you consider how many users we have because dropbox

45:21.240 --> 45:23.240
charges by the user

45:23.320 --> 45:28.680
Right if you consider how many users we need our cost is probably around a hundred dollars a month for dropbox if you were to

45:28.920 --> 45:33.720
Take the annual cost and spread it out. So 85 would be cheaper. It's still it's still a lot of money

45:34.200 --> 45:35.880
It's still a lot of money

45:35.880 --> 45:41.720
And I wonder if what we really need is something that's just a small tiny storage of in progress files

45:42.040 --> 45:45.800
I think that's big a big part of this is we got to go we should go do some pruning and see

45:45.800 --> 45:51.000
Go do some pruning and figure out like what do we need to have hot and what can be left in archival storage?

45:51.320 --> 45:53.320
And then invest in

45:54.280 --> 45:58.840
Storage at the studio in the physical box here that we can add to

45:59.400 --> 46:03.320
But then it just sort of changes the backup scenario here in the studio. So I got to think about that

46:04.200 --> 46:09.720
It's a can of worms, but we do appreciate uh, the feedback guys. It's given us something to think about

46:10.520 --> 46:14.040
Now, uh west there was somebody wrote in asking for time stamps. You want to take that one?

46:14.040 --> 46:17.160
Yeah, oh, yes. Okay. I guess this is a request for me then

46:18.040 --> 46:19.800
as it writes in

46:19.800 --> 46:25.100
Wanting time stamps. Here's a humble request that time stamps be included in the podcast description

46:25.320 --> 46:29.960
So I can go right to the segments. I most want to hear. Thank you. Love the show great work

46:30.840 --> 46:37.080
Okay. Hey, that's pretty reasonable. We do have them, you know available as chapter markers and we've got them on youtube

46:37.400 --> 46:38.760
But that might not be everywhere

46:38.760 --> 46:43.420
I guess that's something we could consider because I guess we could just extract it from the chapter information

46:43.420 --> 46:49.820
And there's just put it in the description. Yeah, we can add it to the long form description. That shouldn't be too big a problem

46:50.060 --> 46:51.420
That's something we'll think about uh

46:51.420 --> 46:56.540
But this also is just a good chance to remind you that we do have chapter markers for almost all our shows all our shows

46:56.700 --> 47:01.980
Yes, and um, you can jump right past any segment you like or you can jump to a topic

47:02.700 --> 47:09.580
um using those and they should be in just about every mobile podcast player and uh, we'll we'll start

47:09.580 --> 47:15.340
Um looking into embedding it in the show notes. There's a possibility too there because we already have the information

47:16.300 --> 47:22.940
All right. Now we have one last feedback that I will read and it's a plug for a audience member's own project

47:23.020 --> 47:24.780
But it's so dang cool

47:24.780 --> 47:26.380
I wanted to talk about it

47:26.380 --> 47:31.180
He said i've created an app just for linux that I think fellow space nerds like you would be interested in it's called

47:31.640 --> 47:37.260
Astro ninja and it's written in python using mostly pi q5 and scrappy spiders

47:37.260 --> 47:43.820
I love it. It has the full worldwide launch schedules industry news hubble images

47:44.300 --> 47:51.600
Launch tallies and spacex live streams built in the project just reached its alpha release and i'm trying to invite like-minded individuals

47:51.820 --> 47:56.060
To check it out and seeing how I really oh, geez now he's bragging now

47:56.060 --> 47:57.100
He's talking nice about it

47:57.100 --> 47:59.820
He loves the show and he sees he's been listening for years

48:00.060 --> 48:03.180
And he said he first thought of thought of us and wanted to pass it along

48:03.180 --> 48:09.020
So in the show notes will have a link to his email where he has links to a youtube video that shows it off

48:09.180 --> 48:11.340
And we'll put a link to his github repo

48:12.140 --> 48:16.220
Um, which you can go check out the project if you're a space nerd want to geek out on that stuff

48:16.220 --> 48:21.100
It's astro ninja and it just hit alpha and it's up on github kind of cool

48:21.420 --> 48:25.820
This looks pretty handy as a little dashboard and it's not another electron app

48:25.820 --> 48:31.740
So you just need python and uh cubed installed and away you go. Yeah, most linux desktops are gonna have that

48:31.740 --> 48:34.080
So thanks for sending that along tom and congratulations

48:34.860 --> 48:40.300
On the release it does look like it's a pretty cool project astro ninja is a good name, too, right?

48:41.100 --> 48:45.180
I love that. I love watching those spacex launches too, right? And you know, they use a bunch of linux

48:45.180 --> 48:47.180
So clearly linux and astronomy

48:47.820 --> 48:49.820
They're just made to be together

48:50.460 --> 48:55.100
All right. Well that brings us to the end of this week's official program. Thanks so much for listening

48:55.340 --> 48:57.040
We'd love to have you tune in live over jblive.tv

48:58.140 --> 48:59.900
or if you can't

48:59.900 --> 49:02.860
Thanks for listening on the download. We like that too. That's just fine

49:03.100 --> 49:05.980
In fact, why not share this podcast with a linux loving friend?

49:06.620 --> 49:11.980
That'd be great, too. You can find links to everything we talked about at linux unplugged dot com slash

49:13.560 --> 49:20.460
363 63. Yeah. Thanks wess. I was gonna get there 363 linux unplugged dot com slash 363

49:20.460 --> 49:22.620
And the show is at linux unplugged on twitter

49:23.020 --> 49:27.820
Thanks so much for tuning into this week's episode of the unplugged program and we'll see you right back here

49:27.820 --> 49:29.820
next tuesday

49:57.820 --> 49:59.820
So

50:06.380 --> 50:07.980
So by bitten you were

50:07.980 --> 50:13.500
Chatting in the irc that there is a linux desktop service out there called ubi desktop

50:13.740 --> 50:21.420
Yeah, so I stumbled upon it and it is kind of neat for uh 10 years a month you get a uh, single core

50:22.440 --> 50:24.540
3.4 gigahertz 2 gigabytes ram

50:24.540 --> 50:32.140
Uh 32 gigs of ssd storage and one terabytes a month of trap traffic at one gigabits a second

50:32.380 --> 50:39.020
How do you know how much your desktop traffic's gonna that's that's a tricky one, but a terabyte you'd think would be enough. Yeah, and uh,

50:40.060 --> 50:44.300
It is depending on if the rdp or uh, what kind of uh,

50:44.940 --> 50:49.980
Uh vnc kind of service if that data gets counted, uh against it or not

50:49.980 --> 50:55.660
Uh, but it is very easy and they have a free to try option

50:55.740 --> 51:03.020
And if you scroll a bit more down, they have a discount coupon code and they have an extreme version at 43

51:03.340 --> 51:11.340
90 a month you get four virtual cpus eight gigs of ram 128 gigabytes of ssd and five terabytes of traffic

51:11.900 --> 51:13.900
That ssd is a little tight though

51:13.900 --> 51:18.620
That's interesting. If you were a new business that was starting up. You didn't have any machines

51:18.620 --> 51:24.300
Right and someone was going to sell you this service. Would they just run on thin clients? Yeah, exactly

51:24.300 --> 51:26.300
I mean think about another way

51:26.300 --> 51:32.940
Isn't it silly to buy 800 pcs with 125 monitor and a mouse and keyboard?

51:33.260 --> 51:37.180
That you then go license software for then you have to have an it person manage it

51:37.900 --> 51:42.220
How silly is that for an office of five people or 15 people or even 100 people?

51:42.380 --> 51:46.940
And if you scroll down far enough, do you need a vdi try desktop as a service?

51:46.940 --> 51:55.020
They even support those kind of things. Yeah, it's pretty wild. Um, so it's coming and obviously it doesn't mean it's going to replace

51:55.740 --> 52:00.220
Traditional computers because there's so many reasons why you still need a traditional computer at a desk

52:00.220 --> 52:03.580
But you got to figure if chromebooks have been pretty successful

52:03.580 --> 52:08.620
There's probably a market for this kind of thing too. And i've heard from listeners in the past that

52:09.420 --> 52:14.780
Use this as a daily driver as part of their work. It's some other vendors virtual desktop solution right now

52:14.780 --> 52:20.300
But it's already out there to some degree and being widely used one challenge. I can't get around is the

52:20.860 --> 52:25.580
Necessity for always connected internet. I run into this all the time even at home, you know, okay

52:25.580 --> 52:30.940
I've got this stable connection and it just you know drops and so if i'm in the middle of something that is one of the

52:31.420 --> 52:37.900
Biggest productivity killers ever. That's why I think it's so office focused, you know, you picture someone in a downtown office suite

52:38.220 --> 52:40.220
Their building has fiber connection

52:40.780 --> 52:42.780
Probably, you know the best case scenario

52:42.780 --> 52:46.080
It's basically the opposite of wherever Brent is. Yeah, or me
