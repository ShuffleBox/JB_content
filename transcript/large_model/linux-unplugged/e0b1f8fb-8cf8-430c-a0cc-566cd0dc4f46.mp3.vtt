This is Linux Unplugged Episode 6 for September 17th, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:41.360
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, a weekly unscripted Linux podcast that's been taking RMS a little

00:41.360 --> 00:45.120
more seriously. It's brought to you by our fine sponsor Ting.com. I'll tell you more

00:45.120 --> 00:51.000
about how great Ting is as the show goes on. My name is Chris and my name is Matt. Welcome

00:51.000 --> 00:56.520
back from the trip. Thank you. Thank you. Good times. How was the trip? It was unbelievable.

00:56.520 --> 01:01.560
It was just what the doctor ordered. Oh, I bet. So I think I saw your waterfall picture.

01:01.560 --> 01:05.760
That's what it was. Yeah, we went out to Lake Chelan here in Eastern Washington and it was

01:05.760 --> 01:09.760
just amazing. Yeah, I showed that to the kids. They're like, I don't want to go there. So

01:09.760 --> 01:13.480
that sounds like a must do. And you did it just at the right time. It wasn't probably

01:13.480 --> 01:22.280
too hot, right? Oh, yes, it was. When we first got over the mountains, we were about 101,

01:22.280 --> 01:29.600
I think it averaged in the mid nineties, the rest of the trip. Oh, wow. So I forget, you

01:29.600 --> 01:32.800
know, like you were just saying on the pre show, uh, there is a whole nother side to

01:32.800 --> 01:36.840
our state that is like a completely different state. It really is. Yeah. It's fascinating

01:36.840 --> 01:40.040
when you go over those mountains, how warm it gets. Well, uh, we've got a big show. Guess

01:40.040 --> 01:44.440
what? Big show. Uh, so this week I want to talk a little bit about losing the flame for

01:44.440 --> 01:47.640
Android. Uh, if you've followed this week's Coderator, you probably know where I'm talking

01:47.640 --> 01:50.760
about what we're going to get into it on this backing up a Linux server and a set it and

01:50.760 --> 01:54.720
forget it way. I'd like to maybe pick the mumble server, uh, their brain folks on the

01:54.720 --> 01:59.240
mumble server. And then of course we've got our feedback on our follow-up as always, but

01:59.240 --> 02:02.920
nothing planned, nothing planned. I'm just saying, I'm just saying, so why don't we just,

02:02.920 --> 02:07.040
why don't we bust through some quick F U that's what I'm labeling the follow-up is F U, the

02:07.040 --> 02:11.320
F U segment, the F U segment. And, uh, the, probably the first thing, uh, oh, you know

02:11.320 --> 02:14.640
what I need, I need like an F U a segment here. Let's see, maybe this could be our F

02:14.640 --> 02:19.080
U segment bump. He's a jackass. What do you think that works? I, you know, I think it's

02:19.080 --> 02:24.120
short sweetened. It's a, to the point. All right. Well, so I remember last week during

02:24.120 --> 02:28.520
the news segment on the Linux action show, we were saying that a system D a number build

02:28.520 --> 02:33.480
207 is coming to, to all of a distributions near you that run system D and that there

02:33.480 --> 02:38.960
was that Etsy sys tl.com file that I was wondering if arch users were going to get bitten by.

02:38.960 --> 02:43.800
Exactly. I specum allocated out loud in the, uh, in the show and we had a few people write

02:43.800 --> 02:49.320
in and, uh, tell us what's up with that. And they pointed us to the source of all knowledge

02:49.320 --> 02:55.400
in arch and that is the arch Wiki. And actually in this case is the news section. Uh, uh,

02:55.400 --> 02:58.560
and it is, you will have a little bit of work to do if you've been using it, but however,

02:58.560 --> 03:02.000
if you have a fairly recent installation, you probably don't have anything in there.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.720
There is a Sim link you need to do if you do have config info in there. And if you don't

03:05.720 --> 03:08.860
just go look at that file and if you really haven't said anything in there, you don't

03:08.860 --> 03:12.960
have to worry. Good times. I love that. I love the fact that their Wiki really spells

03:12.960 --> 03:16.720
it out in a real clean, easy to follow way. Yeah. Following the arch news and there's

03:16.720 --> 03:21.480
also a mailing list you can follow is always a good step. I, um, I don't always check before

03:21.480 --> 03:25.960
I, before I, before I run it. Uh, but I, I generally try to, and we're going to have

03:25.960 --> 03:29.320
a, we're going to have an email, um, coming up a little bit later in the show about the

03:29.320 --> 03:33.680
arch challenge again, King backup. And so I thought we'd cover that and let people know.

03:33.680 --> 03:38.100
There's also another email. Actually, this was a bit message we got and they said in

03:38.100 --> 03:41.840
last episode of last, you talked about note taking programs, which by the way, some people

03:41.840 --> 03:45.680
loved Matt and then some people hated, some people were down with it. Well, you know,

03:45.680 --> 03:49.080
some people take notes and other people have that mega memory thing going on. So yeah,

03:49.080 --> 03:53.120
okay. Yeah, I guess so. Uh, but one that didn't get mentioned. And so our bit messenger wanted

03:53.120 --> 03:57.840
to make sure I gave it a shout out is cherry tree. Cherry tree, I think has gotten some

03:57.840 --> 04:01.520
love on the show. I want to say it might've been a pick at one point. Cherry tree notes

04:01.520 --> 04:06.080
is great though. And it's got, it's got its own good, uh, like it supports rich text formatting.

04:06.080 --> 04:12.000
It's got its own syntax. You can, uh, you can follow. And, uh, I have not actually, uh,

04:12.000 --> 04:15.120
used it beyond like, you know, trying it out to see if it would do my, what I wanted for,

04:15.120 --> 04:18.920
I don't remember what it was about if it didn't quite grab me. Maybe it was the way it implemented

04:18.920 --> 04:23.960
X, Y, and Z or whatever it was. Sure. The UI actually, to be honest with you, it's sometimes

04:23.960 --> 04:28.640
with note taking part of it is like, um, you know, you got to work in this space. You got

04:28.640 --> 04:33.100
to live inside this application. So, well, I know UI is a big, it's an important part

04:33.100 --> 04:37.840
of your space because it's, you know, you, you're very UI centric. And so for me, it's

04:37.840 --> 04:41.720
a lot of times of, you know, can I, I don't know, ham fist through it. And a lot of times

04:41.720 --> 04:44.880
I'll put up with a lot of that kind of stuff. I don't know. I'm looking at it now and it's

04:44.880 --> 04:49.840
honestly, I don't, I doesn't look so bad, you know, it definitely kind of has a QT feel

04:49.840 --> 04:56.480
to it. So yeah. So I thought, um, uh, one last bit of followup that I wanted to get

04:56.480 --> 04:59.920
to, uh, because I wanted to spot to talk about this where people wouldn't be like, oh, you

04:59.920 --> 05:04.560
guys are just saying this because they sponsor you. Right? Sure. And that is today the new

05:04.560 --> 05:09.280
system 76 rig was launched. Now remember last week we said they're going to have a new leopard

05:09.280 --> 05:12.800
extreme coming. They're calling it, I think they're calling it like the leopard X four,

05:12.800 --> 05:17.400
the Leo X four. I'll pull it up here while we talk about it. Um, so system 76 sponsors

05:17.400 --> 05:21.320
Linux action show, but they don't sponsor this show. Um, but we are both personally

05:21.320 --> 05:24.560
fans of system 76. That's one of the reasons we were able to twist their arm to come on

05:24.560 --> 05:28.920
board. Oh yeah. And so they updated today, their leopard extreme rig, man, have you had

05:28.920 --> 05:32.600
a chance to look at this thing? I was looking through it and it's just like, I mean, first

05:32.600 --> 05:36.160
of all, the first tip I would give anyone looking at the pictures is prior face off

05:36.160 --> 05:40.960
the screen so you can actually take in the images because I was so busy trying to like

05:40.960 --> 05:45.200
throw my money at the screen and get it, you know, like trying to like make it materialize

05:45.200 --> 05:47.960
in front of me that I wasn't able to fully appreciate it till I pulled away a little

05:47.960 --> 05:51.640
bit and I looking at it, it looks really powerful. I've already done a few builds. Yeah. They're

05:51.640 --> 05:57.520
using a Corsair, um, um, water cooling solution. I've used the similar water cooling solution

05:57.520 --> 06:00.960
and it's really cool because what it does is it's not very complicated. It just runs

06:00.960 --> 06:04.840
to a radiator. I believe I'm guessing based cause I have a similar model. It runs to a

06:04.840 --> 06:09.520
radiator that's connected to your 120 millimeter fan in the back of the case. And so it's,

06:09.520 --> 06:12.400
it just uses the regular case cooling to cool it. So you don't have to have like a radiator

06:12.400 --> 06:17.620
sitting on top of the rig. Um, and, and so this to me is one of those things where I

06:17.620 --> 06:20.980
think the first reaction a lot of people are going to have is it's probably too expensive

06:20.980 --> 06:25.280
because it is a, it's a highly priced machine. It's for, it's a high end machine for folks

06:25.280 --> 06:29.680
that want high end performance and a high end experience without having to monkey with

06:29.680 --> 06:33.700
something themselves. I think that's the real differential. This is a total pro level machine.

06:33.700 --> 06:37.980
So like here, I thought I'd, so if I was going to build a machine, I would get the six core

06:37.980 --> 06:44.160
fourth gen Intel I seven, which runs at 3.4 gigahertz. I would get 32 gigs of Ram. Uh,

06:44.160 --> 06:48.360
probably because if I'm going to have a machine this nice, I also want to play video games

06:48.360 --> 06:52.960
and I also use GPU accelerated functions. So they have an Nvidia graphics card here that

06:52.960 --> 06:58.720
has a 5, uh, 1,500 CUDA cores. Uh, that would be the one I'm going to go with kind of expensive,

06:58.720 --> 07:03.520
but I could use that. Um, I would probably not go rate. I'd go a 240 gigabyte SSD for

07:03.520 --> 07:08.760
the primary hard drive and then maybe like, uh, I probably keep it as tight as I needed.

07:08.760 --> 07:12.380
Three terabytes would probably be enough for my working space for my scratch. Oh yeah.

07:12.380 --> 07:16.080
You know what'd be awesome with this too is if you're someone that does a lot of VMs like

07:16.080 --> 07:19.880
simultaneously and you just don't care about, you don't want to have to think about do I

07:19.880 --> 07:23.360
have too many running or whatever, that would be fantastic. Anything that's really performance

07:23.360 --> 07:29.160
intensive. It actually clocked in less than I thought, uh, 30 at $3,059. Oh, that's actually

07:29.160 --> 07:34.400
a lot. So now I would have figured for, I'm going to go to apple.com slash door. And the

07:34.400 --> 07:41.080
reason why is because I'm comparing this leopard extreme to the Mac pro. I think this is for

07:41.080 --> 07:47.000
content creators is for people who want, um, you know, like if I'm a plumber, I get myself

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
a real special kind of, this is not to compare the Mac mini to, uh, the extreme is to prepare.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.200
I would go a slightly slower processor, but I would go two cores, uh, or, uh, this is

07:58.200 --> 08:03.720
yeah. Six core. Now this is a Xeon 32 gigs of Ram. Um, let's go. We can't do, we'll do

08:03.720 --> 08:11.180
a fire already without even going to step two at 61 99. No, and I'm at 7,500. Wow. Crap.

08:11.180 --> 08:14.320
And the thing looks like a trashcan. So we'll know that we don't even know what the price

08:14.320 --> 08:19.200
of that one's going to be. But my point is, is this leopard extreme is this is a professional's

08:19.200 --> 08:22.800
computer. This is something that I, you know, if Chris Buysie writes off on his taxes, right?

08:22.800 --> 08:27.400
This is, that's what this is now. I just even the next gen a Mac yet, or is this still the

08:27.400 --> 08:30.920
old one? That's the old one. So this is the one that looks like a computer. But I think

08:30.920 --> 08:35.480
this, because it's, it's got, it's a tower. So it has PCI express slots available to you

08:35.480 --> 08:39.960
where the new trashcan doesn't like, I think as more people move to Linux for certain functionality,

08:39.960 --> 08:44.560
I've been looking at a new generation of media production apps. Uh, one that just hit the

08:44.560 --> 08:48.760
subreddit today. It's an audio editing application. It's in beta. I've been keeping an eye on

08:48.760 --> 08:51.880
it. Um, and then another one that a video editing application that hit the subreddit

08:51.880 --> 08:57.860
a couple of days ago that is yes, once again, another video editor, but I actually edited

08:57.860 --> 09:03.140
a mock episode of Linux unplugged in that video editor last weekend. And I, it actually

09:03.140 --> 09:09.680
wasn't perfect. It definitely wasn't as fast as my current workflow, but it was the closest

09:09.680 --> 09:14.720
I've ever gotten to taking non-native Linux codecs. These were ProRes codecs, bringing

09:14.720 --> 09:18.720
them into a Linux editor, assembling it the way I need it with the music cues and the

09:18.720 --> 09:25.320
transition spots and, and then export it out to a file, a master file that I can then encode

09:25.320 --> 09:30.320
on the distributed machines that produce all the different file formats. Um, it, it like

09:30.320 --> 09:35.200
actually the whole process from end to end actually happened in this, in this environment

09:35.200 --> 09:40.600
like on a Linux box. It was amazing. And so we're definitely very close to the point where

09:40.600 --> 09:45.600
if I changed a few behaviors and if I changed a work, a few workflow things and I was willing

09:45.600 --> 09:49.240
to live with maybe a little less quality, maybe, you know, silly things too, like night

09:49.240 --> 09:53.300
is not, not as nice transitions, maybe a reduction in audio quality slightly because this didn't

09:53.300 --> 10:02.020
have any audio processing. Um, we are at the point where I actually think this could all

10:02.020 --> 10:05.400
be done on Linux. And that's pretty exciting because then it starts, you start looking

10:05.400 --> 10:09.440
at this like the celebrity extreme and now it's actually like, you know, we're really,

10:09.440 --> 10:14.560
really close. Um, and I think I could do 70% of it today on that. So I'm really excited

10:14.560 --> 10:18.920
about it. I'm going to, you know, I'm not sure I'm ready because honestly the Bonobo,

10:18.920 --> 10:23.120
uh, with its, I mean the thing has two hard drives, so my IO problem is solved. They're

10:23.120 --> 10:28.480
both SSDs. It's a core I seven, it's got 16 gigs of Ram. So the Bonobo has done so well.

10:28.480 --> 10:32.760
So I'm, I'm like, do I just run it on the Bonobo or do I maybe do this towards the end

10:32.760 --> 10:37.780
of the year as like a, you know, 2013 taxes thing? I don't know, but I'm really excited

10:37.780 --> 10:43.120
about it. I say hats off to system 76, that elaborate extreme. I think people can think

10:43.120 --> 10:46.000
I'm, I think I'm crazy for saying this, but I think it looks like the best computer for

10:46.000 --> 10:50.240
Linux for this year, maybe even 2014. Oh, that's not even a question. I mean, you just

10:50.240 --> 10:53.300
look, I mean, as you just did the comparison with the Mac, there was no question there

10:53.300 --> 10:57.640
at all. And then of course, as far as knowing the machine is going to be built to the specifications

10:57.640 --> 11:01.880
you want and everything just works, it's got a solid warranty. The company's been around

11:01.880 --> 11:05.880
for a long time. It's just a win-win. So yeah, it looks really good too. I like the look

11:05.880 --> 11:10.480
of it too, the size and anyways, really excited. And, uh, I emailed them asking them for a

11:10.480 --> 11:15.120
demo unit. So we'll see, I know that would be fantastic. Their inventory is tight and

11:15.120 --> 11:18.640
they're building a lot of them in the U S now and that makes it even tighter. So I know

11:18.640 --> 11:22.360
it's, it might not happen, but I thought I'd, I'd put it out there. Doesn't hurt. Yeah.

11:22.360 --> 11:26.680
Yeah. All right, Matt. Well, before I get to what's been troubling me this week, deep

11:26.680 --> 11:31.880
down on the inside and why I think maybe RMS has been right all along and we just haven't

11:31.880 --> 11:37.440
been receiving his wisdom and now I'm rethinking everything. I want to talk about our sponsor

11:37.440 --> 11:42.920
this week and that my friends is ting.com. Look, if you go to linux.ting.com, we've got

11:42.920 --> 11:48.640
a landing page for you built just for you, customized just for you. Now ting is mobile.

11:48.640 --> 11:52.960
That makes sense. They're a completely new way of doing mobile and they give me a lot

11:52.960 --> 11:57.180
of hope for the future of this industry. First of all, probably the biggest differentiator,

11:57.180 --> 12:01.400
no contracts, no early termination fees and you pay for what you use. So you get a line,

12:01.400 --> 12:06.280
it's $6 a month. If you use a hundred minutes, you end up just going to that hundred minute

12:06.280 --> 12:09.560
bucket and that's what you pay. Ting takes your minutes, your megabytes and your messages

12:09.560 --> 12:12.480
and they add them all up at the, at the end of the month. And if you're like me and you're

12:12.480 --> 12:18.080
a little bit savvy on your voice, some months I squeak away with hardly any voice minutes

12:18.080 --> 12:23.280
at all. And my bill is about as low as it can get. It's usually in the $12 to $15 range.

12:23.280 --> 12:28.680
Average price, average bill on ting for a ting customer is $22 or $21. I'm sorry. Uh,

12:28.680 --> 12:31.200
so you know, it's a pretty reasonable price. It's not only that, but they have a good range

12:31.200 --> 12:35.680
of phones from pre pre-owned phones that you can get at a great discount feature phones

12:35.680 --> 12:40.880
and also high end phones like the HTC one, which is, which has fantastic speakers, which

12:40.880 --> 12:44.720
is great for podcasts listening, but also has incredible screen, which is great for

12:44.720 --> 12:49.160
watching content like our shows. So when you go over to ting, you might notice if you play

12:49.160 --> 12:52.960
around that they've got some shots of their dashboard. That's actually what their dashboard

12:52.960 --> 12:57.000
looks like. It is legitimately that beautiful. It is legitimately that easy to use and it

12:57.000 --> 13:01.120
is very functional. You can do everything from porting a phone, deactivating a phone,

13:01.120 --> 13:05.000
buying a phone, transferring a phone, anything for their website. Matt, what was your impression?

13:05.000 --> 13:09.420
You know, you're on ting too. You got, you got the note too. What was that process like

13:09.420 --> 13:11.620
setting that up on, on the ting website?

13:11.620 --> 13:15.560
Setting it up was surprisingly simple. I was amazed that even though I had to release the

13:15.560 --> 13:19.840
phone from its original owner, which was you, that only took like a couple seconds, uh,

13:19.840 --> 13:23.880
just using their help file. And once that was done, the actual setup process, I think

13:23.880 --> 13:27.760
was under like a two minutes, minute and a half. It was something crazy. I didn't have

13:27.760 --> 13:31.760
to talk to anybody, even though you can get a real person if you do. But it was awesome.

13:31.760 --> 13:32.760
It was so easy.

13:32.760 --> 13:36.720
Yeah. Ting, uh, ting also has a great blog where they're actively posting the stuff that

13:36.720 --> 13:39.700
they think people that are ting users might be interested in because the ting customer

13:39.700 --> 13:43.240
base I think is a little savvier than your average bear. And so here's five things you

13:43.240 --> 13:46.920
didn't know your smartphone could do. Matt, this is totally, totally up your alley. Remotely

13:46.920 --> 13:51.600
control your electronics. They highlight these Belkin Wemo switches that integrate with an

13:51.600 --> 13:52.600
app.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.600
That's awesome.

13:53.600 --> 13:57.280
Yeah. So you can control your different devices, scan high quality documents, play laser tag.

13:57.280 --> 14:01.160
And here's one that I really like. Measure the speed of a moving object. They talk about

14:01.160 --> 14:05.160
this app called speed gun that lets you, you take speed gun, you pointed at something that

14:05.160 --> 14:09.280
moves across the frame and it tells you how fast that thing is moving. How cool is that?

14:09.280 --> 14:12.920
Pick up a notch. And you said they have, you can do laser tag. They have an article telling

14:12.920 --> 14:13.920
you this. This is cool.

14:13.920 --> 14:17.480
Yeah. They got laser tag. They got laser tag. Yeah. It was called app tag and it's designed

14:17.480 --> 14:20.840
to let you play. Yes. Ting blog is awesome. But one of the things that I caught on the

14:20.840 --> 14:25.380
ting blog recently is they're doing early termination fee relief. So if you're in a

14:25.380 --> 14:29.000
contract now and you really want to get out and you want to start saving money, you want

14:29.000 --> 14:32.280
to move over to ting because you love that included hotspot. You love that included tethering.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.400
You love the fact that they don't bundle anything along that you wouldn't expect. You love the

14:35.400 --> 14:38.600
transparent nature of the company and you love what they're about. Maybe you want to

14:38.600 --> 14:41.480
get out of that contract a little early. Now ting is going to help you with that. They're

14:41.480 --> 14:46.080
going to take up to 75% off of that early termination fee. So all you have to do, get

14:46.080 --> 14:50.440
your ting phone, you activate it and then you send them your ETF claim and they'll cut

14:50.440 --> 14:53.880
you a check right there or actually maybe a credit. But think about that. Think about

14:53.880 --> 14:58.440
how awesome that is. It helps not only relieve the blow of having to cancel that contract,

14:58.440 --> 15:02.020
but then it just increases the amount of money you're going to save on the long run by switching

15:02.020 --> 15:07.880
to ting. So go to linux.ting.com. Take $25 off your first device or $25 off your first

15:07.880 --> 15:10.640
month of service if you're going to bring your own device. In fact, they even have a

15:10.640 --> 15:15.240
concierge service to help find a used device for you so you can get a great deal on a device.

15:15.240 --> 15:18.800
I love that. And if you've got somebody on maybe in your family that doesn't want a very

15:18.800 --> 15:22.600
powerful phone, you can still bring them on, have a shared family pool of minutes with

15:22.600 --> 15:25.680
unlimited lines and you can just give them a feature phone because ting has some great

15:25.680 --> 15:29.280
feature phones. Yes, they're still a thing. They're out there. So awesome things got them

15:29.280 --> 15:34.000
including some of the best android devices. So thanks to ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged

15:34.000 --> 15:42.440
stuff. So one of the things that RMS warned us about, Matt, was that TiVo... It's negative

15:42.440 --> 15:48.680
in the freedom dimension. Remember, he was quite concerned about the TiVoization of Linux.

15:48.680 --> 15:54.240
And in fact, you could say that maybe that was a huge inspiration for a lot of the provisions

15:54.240 --> 15:59.160
in the GPL3. I think so. I think that was definitely something that they forced them

15:59.160 --> 16:02.640
to take a second look at that. And now we're looking back at it and it's like, oh my God,

16:02.640 --> 16:07.480
he's right on a lot of stuff. I think the TiVoization... I think what TiVo has done

16:07.480 --> 16:14.360
to Linux is quaint and adorable in comparison to what Android has done to Linux. I think

16:14.360 --> 16:19.120
what has happened where you have an open source operating system where the core is open and

16:19.120 --> 16:22.520
then there's layers of stuff on top of it that are Apache licensed and then there's

16:22.520 --> 16:26.100
layers on top of that that are just commercially, you know, whatever their commercial proprietary

16:26.100 --> 16:31.440
licenses and then Google takes this, all bundles it all up and hands it out to these OEMs that

16:31.440 --> 16:35.800
then inject their proprietary code at the firmware level, at the radio level, at the

16:35.800 --> 16:40.720
OS kernel level, at the user land space level, and even in the services level with the cloud

16:40.720 --> 16:45.620
services these things connect to. Every single layer, we take this open source operated open

16:45.620 --> 16:51.640
platform and we inject this proprietary code and lock down into it at all different levels.

16:51.640 --> 16:55.840
We bastardize this thing. We make it an embarrassment of the original intent and then we ship it

16:55.840 --> 16:59.840
as a product out to consumers and then to make matters worse, not only have we developed

16:59.840 --> 17:04.480
one of the most incredible fast-moving open source projects that has thousands of intelligent

17:04.480 --> 17:08.160
contributors making the thing better every single day, but we managed to figure out a

17:08.160 --> 17:11.320
way to ship a product running that that doesn't receive updates.

17:11.320 --> 17:15.440
That's right. And people are excited to get new ones, you know, that are literally oftentimes

17:15.440 --> 17:17.560
running the same OS as the phone they just had.

17:17.560 --> 17:24.760
So I'm at a point now and I think it's one part NSA inspired fear mongering because like

17:24.760 --> 17:28.760
maybe it just has me thinking about cloud services in a different perspective, right?

17:28.760 --> 17:31.800
I think it had, yeah, I think it, for you, it has a lot to do with that. I think it has

17:31.800 --> 17:38.680
a lot to do with, I want to find devices and tools that compliment my desire to internalize

17:38.680 --> 17:41.800
my own personal cloud in my own land, not outside of it.

17:41.800 --> 17:47.160
Right. Yeah, exactly. Create your own cloud. Um, and I, so I, I think I'm not, I don't

17:47.160 --> 17:52.280
want to start this off to, to slam Android because I think Android is a really great

17:52.280 --> 17:58.520
solution for a lot of people that offers a lot of great features over the other alternatives.

17:58.520 --> 18:02.240
Let's take the number one alternative iOS and let's just, you know, here's a great one

18:02.240 --> 18:05.080
off the top of my head. Swabbing out the keyboard. We were talking about this on the pre-show.

18:05.080 --> 18:10.720
The fact that the fact that iOS still has this, this ridiculous keyboard. I mean, it's

18:10.720 --> 18:15.080
a, it's kind of an embarrassment, right? So I'm not, I don't mean to demean Android or

18:15.080 --> 18:18.780
demean anyone who chooses it to use it as their mobile platform because I think there's

18:18.780 --> 18:24.680
a lot of merit to the platform. However, I have to bring up issues with what, what Google,

18:24.680 --> 18:27.640
I think Google has been a bad steward of this operating system.

18:27.640 --> 18:32.560
I think they have left consumers in vulnerable positions. I think it is not an exaggeration

18:32.560 --> 18:36.640
to call year old Android devices exploits in the pocket. I think that's exactly what

18:36.640 --> 18:41.440
they are. But, and I acknowledge there are power user solutions to this, like replacing

18:41.440 --> 18:46.680
ROMs and other things, but they're not a solution for the majority of people. So I want to couch

18:46.680 --> 18:51.920
this by saying I'm about to get a little ranty on Android, but I don't, I don't want anyone

18:51.920 --> 18:57.320
to take that as judgment because I, I'm not saying there's a perfect solution here, but

18:57.320 --> 19:02.520
I'm looking at this now, Matt. So this last week in a Linux action show, I ended the,

19:02.520 --> 19:05.160
the Android app picks. I didn't say anything to you because it was just something internally

19:05.160 --> 19:09.800
to me that like, I just knew I was done doing this. And I said in the show, I don't want

19:09.800 --> 19:13.920
to, you know, I don't want to make a big stink about it in the Linux podcast of record in

19:13.920 --> 19:18.440
the big show, but I said in the show that I didn't feel like I need to evangelize this

19:18.440 --> 19:19.440
platform anymore.

19:19.440 --> 19:23.760
Yeah. I remember. And it was, it was for me, it was cause I knew nothing really any backstory

19:23.760 --> 19:28.000
to it. It was very sudden and I figured it must have been okay. Maybe it's just burnout

19:28.000 --> 19:31.080
on talking about apps. Okay. Yeah, that's cool.

19:31.080 --> 19:38.080
So I feel like it's probably, it's, it's deeper than that. I think I've been rethinking cloud

19:38.080 --> 19:43.680
services. I've been rethinking the treatment of this open platform by the carriers, by

19:43.680 --> 19:51.240
the OEMs and by Google. In fact, I have a, I have a quote here from RMS that I, I, you

19:51.240 --> 19:56.520
know, it's been interesting as some of this stuff has come out, either be the, either

19:56.520 --> 20:01.920
be the NSA stuff or looking at the situation with Android. A lot of stuff that RMS said

20:01.920 --> 20:06.120
a while ago actually rings true with me now. And he was just kind of ahead of us. And so

20:06.120 --> 20:11.240
here, here's the point. So in an interview by the Guardian, Richard Stallman was asked

20:11.240 --> 20:14.560
whether Android should be considered free or open, right?

20:14.560 --> 20:15.560
Sure.

20:15.560 --> 20:20.840
So RMS responds with Google has complied with the requirements of the GNU general public

20:20.840 --> 20:26.200
license for Linux, but the, but the Apache license on the rest of Android does not require

20:26.200 --> 20:30.880
source release. Google has said it will never publish the source code for Android 3.0 aside

20:30.880 --> 20:35.120
from the Linux component. And even though executables have been released to the public,

20:35.120 --> 20:40.080
Android 3.1 source code is also being withheld. Thus Android 3, apart from Linux, is non-free

20:40.080 --> 20:44.840
software pure and simple. Android is a major step towards an ethical user controlled free

20:44.840 --> 20:50.200
software portable phone, but there is a long way to go. Hackers are working on Replicant,

20:50.200 --> 20:55.520
but it's a big job to support a phone model. Uh, I'm sorry, a new phone model and the remain

20:55.520 --> 20:59.360
and then there remains the problem of the firmwares. Even though Android phones of today

20:59.360 --> 21:05.000
are considerably less bad than Apple or windows smartphones, they cannot be said to respect

21:05.000 --> 21:10.800
your freedom. And the part that I challenge there is I was, I think one of the things

21:10.800 --> 21:15.280
that sort of started to shift my perspective on this is I watched and I watched it happen

21:15.280 --> 21:19.760
in our community and I watched it happen on the internet in general. When the iPhone five

21:19.760 --> 21:25.280
S was announced, everybody took to the web proclaiming that the fingerprint scanner was

21:25.280 --> 21:32.760
an NSA mass collection device and that this would be used to track iPhone users fingerprints.

21:32.760 --> 21:38.280
But I didn't see the same outcry when Android face detection launched or when the Moto X

21:38.280 --> 21:42.440
launched with always listening capabilities. Well, let me ask you this, and I'm asking

21:42.440 --> 21:46.320
this from someone that's not familiar with what's mandatory, what's not on the iPhone.

21:46.320 --> 21:50.980
Is that a mandatory feature or an optional feature? Optional. Okay. And on the Android,

21:50.980 --> 21:57.960
is that a mandatory feature or an optional feature? Uh, for the face unlock? Yeah. Optional.

21:57.960 --> 22:04.400
Both are optional. From that perspective, I award Darwin awards to people that choose

22:04.400 --> 22:08.960
to use them. Right. Well, yeah, there's that, right? And there's, there's a, there's a,

22:08.960 --> 22:11.960
there's a whole series of issues like, uh, like wire point out, like pleading the fifth

22:11.960 --> 22:15.040
when you use your fingerprint or your face to unlock. But well, I think my point was

22:15.040 --> 22:18.440
as people, I feel like our community doesn't think critically about these things. Like

22:18.440 --> 22:23.520
one's always good, one's always evil. I would say that by and large, that's true.

22:23.520 --> 22:27.920
But I think it, I think it's, we look at the lesser two evils, like most people do politically,

22:27.920 --> 22:31.800
I think at that, I think, and that's, and I don't, I don't support that idea, but I think

22:31.800 --> 22:36.080
that's kind of where we're at. And so for each individual, one of us, the most powerful

22:36.080 --> 22:40.160
thing we can do is to have the discussion we're having now talk about the good, the

22:40.160 --> 22:43.680
bad, the ugly, and the choices that each one of us need to reflect on to make the decisions

22:43.680 --> 22:47.240
that's right for us. I think, you know, I'll get some crap because I was particularly hard

22:47.240 --> 22:51.400
in code or radio. Um, but really I think it's being just intellectually honest with yourself,

22:51.400 --> 22:55.880
reanalyzing this stuff and, you know, making sure that it all, it all checks out, you know,

22:55.880 --> 23:00.080
passes the sniff test. Absolutely. So I think you nailed it. I think it's picking the less

23:00.080 --> 23:05.540
of two evils, right? And I think some of us sort of assume Google is less of two evils

23:05.540 --> 23:09.800
because well, Google does summer of code and Google also often mentions things are open

23:09.800 --> 23:14.800
and I love open and better marketing to geeks, quite frankly, right? Right. Yeah. And then

23:14.800 --> 23:19.800
their slogan is don't be evil. I mean, so your first impression is okay, they probably

23:19.800 --> 23:26.680
a good guys. Uh, but I, I just, I think that is not necessarily the case. I think there's

23:26.680 --> 23:31.840
a case to be made that that is a misplaced amount of trust, but I want to back up a little

23:31.840 --> 23:37.000
bit because way I open it. So there's not a great solution either way. And you've recently,

23:37.000 --> 23:43.480
well not recently, but a little while ago you switched from the iPhone to Android. Absolutely.

23:43.480 --> 23:47.280
Yep. And as far as a system functionality level goes, that's, I mean, to you, it must've

23:47.280 --> 23:50.760
seemed like a pretty big upgrade. It was a, it was a huge upgrade. And my motivation,

23:50.760 --> 23:54.200
honestly, I, for a long time, cause I've, you know, you want to go back far enough.

23:54.200 --> 23:58.360
I was on very early versions of a windows mobile, then of course later on blackberry

23:58.360 --> 24:02.120
and so on and so forth. And then I tried this whole iPhone thing and it was just a total

24:02.120 --> 24:05.240
wake up call, especially with, from the browser and all this sort of stuff and being free

24:05.240 --> 24:10.040
of a keyboard. It was a, it was a great experience for what it was. iPhone one, iPhone two, three

24:10.040 --> 24:14.080
and 3G. And then at the, by the time 3G rolled around, I was kind of like, yeah, I'm kind

24:14.080 --> 24:18.320
of done. And, you know, my wife went for, and I actually went with an Android phone

24:18.320 --> 24:23.400
and it was just like someone pulled the, like pulled a kidnapper's hood off my face when

24:23.400 --> 24:27.360
I tried the Android. It's like, oh my God, there's widgets and control and I can make

24:27.360 --> 24:31.040
adult decisions with my phone. Holy crap. It's like, I felt like, there's a file system

24:31.040 --> 24:37.280
in here. It appealed to someone that wanted to really play, you know, with the underpinnings

24:37.280 --> 24:39.920
of their phone a little more as you want to, you know, root it or whatever to get that

24:39.920 --> 24:43.220
functionality with an iPhone, I would have to actually jailbreak it. And I never wanted

24:43.220 --> 24:48.760
to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, I've been looking at it

24:48.760 --> 24:53.420
from the standpoint of a privacy aspect and I, I think, I think the iPhone has a better

24:53.420 --> 24:59.600
argument here. Um, I, I feel like there and it comes down to kind of almost like a fundamental

24:59.600 --> 25:06.100
corporate philosophy. I feel like Android is sold to, so the goal of selling Android

25:06.100 --> 25:09.960
and this is why Google literally gives it away, right? Is because they really want to

25:09.960 --> 25:16.020
eventually sell Google services. That is true. And, and arguably people would point out that

25:16.020 --> 25:21.320
Apple is not motivated in doing that right now. I would counter with bull jobs. Steve

25:21.320 --> 25:25.800
Jobs has passed on. Cook is absolutely going to keep that company competitive. And in order

25:25.800 --> 25:29.320
to do that in the coming years, you damn well better believe they're going to mimic Google's

25:29.320 --> 25:33.560
model. It will happen. I, but here's the difference, right? So here's the difference is they're

25:33.560 --> 25:40.360
making the iPhone and as a checkbox on that, on that box or on that spec sheet, they have

25:40.360 --> 25:47.400
this companion iCloud service, right? Google is the cloud and they make Android to connect

25:47.400 --> 25:53.480
you to it. So Apple is making the iPhone to sell you a overpriced piece of hardware. Google

25:53.480 --> 25:58.300
is making Android to sell you their cloud services. But the problem here is those cloud

25:58.300 --> 26:04.460
services rely on extracting as much information about you as possible, logging that information.

26:04.460 --> 26:08.360
And because they are a US held company, this is where the NSA paranoia comes in. Anything

26:08.360 --> 26:14.400
they learn about you is subpoenable by the FBI, whoever needs to get it right. So arguably

26:14.400 --> 26:20.480
Apple is not a threat in that regard yet. You know, I think even as they begin to roll,

26:20.480 --> 26:24.760
ramp out more and more of those features, it still comes down to a, the basic alignment

26:24.760 --> 26:29.060
of the priorities of the company. Apple is a hardware manufacturer. They live and die

26:29.060 --> 26:32.960
on making that hardware. All of their margins are on hardware. They give away all of the

26:32.960 --> 26:36.700
software because they don't make any money on it. We're talking about a company that

26:36.700 --> 26:42.520
makes billions and billions and billions, hundreds of billions even on selling little

26:42.520 --> 26:47.680
gadgets. Google makes its billions on selling advertising. That's a hundred percent accurate.

26:47.680 --> 26:51.420
No, absolutely true. But I would also point to the evolution of, and I hate to keep bouncing

26:51.420 --> 26:55.920
back to Apple, but it's part of the conversation. Apple computers wasn't always just Apple.

26:55.920 --> 27:00.400
It used to be Apple computers. And they evolved. They had to change their model. They were

27:00.400 --> 27:04.880
no longer just about selling, you know, selling an Apple computer. They were moving into complete

27:04.880 --> 27:09.480
and more of a, I would argue, more of a services based experience, whether it be iTunes or

27:09.480 --> 27:14.160
I this or I that or whatever. And I think the iCloud stuff, and I think that over time

27:14.160 --> 27:19.440
we're going to see them, I would even say probably within, no later than two years from

27:19.440 --> 27:22.160
now become on par with what Google's doing.

27:22.160 --> 27:24.640
So, you know, I think you might be right.

27:24.640 --> 27:29.840
So if you lock yourself into that ecosystem, yeah, you buy yourself a little time, but,

27:29.840 --> 27:34.240
but are they truly going to, do you trust Jim, you know, do you trust Cook enough that

27:34.240 --> 27:37.000
you're going to believe that he's going to tell you, Hey, by the way, we're changing

27:37.000 --> 27:39.920
everything around and we're going to start doing this, this stuff behind the scenes?

27:39.920 --> 27:40.920
Probably not.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.520
I think, I think it might be a heretic in this room, but I think I trust Tim Cook more

27:43.520 --> 27:49.000
than I trust the Google boys. I really do. And like, I'll give, I'll give you an example.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.040
Let's just say all of this information that Google is collecting on us never is used against

27:53.040 --> 27:56.900
us. It's never leaked. It's never, it's never given to the authorities. It's never used

27:56.900 --> 28:01.000
to build a creepy database about knowing what you want before you notice. It's never anything

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
like that.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.800
What happens when the next regime comes in and they have all of that data, they have

28:05.800 --> 28:09.440
access to all of that information. They have all of that there. It's going to get twisted.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.700
And you know, the other thing that I want to get, I want to just mention before it leaves

28:12.700 --> 28:18.100
the chat log is you queue in the chair and GQ says Android is open source and iMessage

28:18.100 --> 28:21.520
is backdoored. Well, how do we know that? Because what we actually have documented is

28:21.520 --> 28:25.800
that iMessage creates an, it has a key on both ends and the messages are encrypted between

28:25.800 --> 28:29.240
the two parties. That's what we know about iMessage. What we know about Hangouts with

28:29.240 --> 28:33.240
the comparable on Android is we know everything on Hangouts goes through Google and is logged

28:33.240 --> 28:36.400
by Google. That's what we know. Those are the things we know there. And you can't call

28:36.400 --> 28:40.240
Google open because it's completely locked down by the carriers, right? And the other

28:40.240 --> 28:43.920
thing is when you say the iPhone is more locked down, everybody's always talking about the

28:43.920 --> 28:47.440
app store, right? Oh, well the iOS app store is super locked down. Well, you know what?

28:47.440 --> 28:52.120
I'm the jackass that just got a crap ton of spyware on his Android device because I installed

28:52.120 --> 28:57.940
a $5 Star Trek application, right? So maybe that is a little reasonable on a phone that's

28:57.940 --> 29:01.460
meant so I can call my wife to see how the kids are doing. Maybe that is partially reasonable.

29:01.460 --> 29:07.200
But also, if the measuring stick for what makes a platform open or closed is how you

29:07.200 --> 29:11.720
load apps, if you can sideload apps or not, or who gets into the Android app store, then

29:11.720 --> 29:15.460
let's talk about Ubuntu Touch and Firefox OS because those would also be considered

29:15.460 --> 29:20.560
locked down because they don't even have an app store. There is open as Safari is on iOS

29:20.560 --> 29:25.480
or Chrome is on Android, right? HTML5, baby. It's an HTML5 app. That's open. There's your

29:25.480 --> 29:26.480
openness.

29:26.480 --> 29:30.440
I think that's really where the focus needs to be is less about Apple, less about if Android

29:30.440 --> 29:33.940
is a concern for folks. And believe me, I get it. I understand that. I just don't buy

29:33.940 --> 29:37.480
into that Apple is going to be wholesome for two years down the road. I think that's crap.

29:37.480 --> 29:43.220
I think at some point, just if they want to be competitive and get onto that whole database

29:43.220 --> 29:46.040
tit that everybody's making all the money on, I think they're going to have to jump

29:46.040 --> 29:49.560
on at some point. But for now, they're not. I get that. But I think the HTML5 stuff, I

29:49.560 --> 29:52.480
think that's where people need to be looking. I think you're spot on with that.

29:52.480 --> 29:53.480
Absolutely.

29:53.480 --> 29:59.320
Again, I'm not throwing my HTC One in the garbage, but I just want to throw a few things

29:59.320 --> 30:03.840
back to people and just get them to think about this a little more because I look at

30:03.840 --> 30:08.320
like trying to move away from Google now and I think about, in a lot of ways, I'm kind

30:08.320 --> 30:11.480
of locked in here. I've got my contacts syncing through Google. I've got my calendar syncing

30:11.480 --> 30:16.140
through Google. All of these cloud services in a form are a type of data lock-in.

30:16.140 --> 30:20.160
And even if you go to Data Liberation, whatever the hell it is that Google offers, they still

30:20.160 --> 30:22.320
retain that information. So that's legitimate as well.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.240
Well, then you think what? Then you get it in like some big old file and it's just a

30:25.240 --> 30:26.240
pain in the butt.

30:26.240 --> 30:28.680
Right. And you've got to deal with it. Yeah. I hear you.

30:28.680 --> 30:32.080
I just wanted to put the brakes on everybody and say, okay, think about this a little bit

30:32.080 --> 30:36.800
because I had an iPhone over the weekend playing with iOS 7 to talk about it on Koda Radio

30:36.800 --> 30:44.080
on Monday. I actually thought it performed better than any Android device I've used.

30:44.080 --> 30:53.920
I hadn't used iMessage before. I think iMessage is great. I actually thought it was a fantastic

30:53.920 --> 30:57.960
user experience. I thought the battery life was way better than I expected. I couldn't

30:57.960 --> 31:02.720
believe how good the battery life was. And to be honest with you, when I'm looking at

31:02.720 --> 31:08.880
the two, I don't think you can really be mad at anybody for choosing one platform over

31:08.880 --> 31:12.960
the other because I think they both have this long list of disadvantages.

31:12.960 --> 31:18.040
Sure. And in my household, as in yours, we run all of them. So I totally get you. No,

31:18.040 --> 31:21.960
I think for me, it's that I look at iOS 7 and it's like, oh, look, I should put on my

31:21.960 --> 31:28.840
Stussy t-shirt and get my TNC surf shop gear because I'm looking at fricking this neon mess.

31:28.840 --> 31:35.520
It kind of does have elements of iOS Vista. It's like they're Vista of iOS a little bit.

31:35.520 --> 31:39.160
So if I wear sunglasses, I can enjoy the performance. I mean, it's just, it's, you know, we just

31:39.160 --> 31:42.880
wait. That's going to make it everywhere else. You just wait. I know it is. And then, and

31:42.880 --> 31:46.680
then all the Linux distros are going to start mimicking. I know. Oh man. That's going to

31:46.680 --> 31:50.520
be awful. All right. I'm harsh on it. I'm harsh on it. I want to see a mumble room.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.640
You guys have been quiet. I know this is something we kick around on the pre-show. What do you

31:53.640 --> 31:59.200
guys think? Am I just off my rocker here? Am I, am I, am I losing it? That was to you

31:59.200 --> 32:03.960
mumble room. Definitely not losing it at all. Like I said in a previous one, they do lock

32:03.960 --> 32:10.680
you down with the ecosystem. Both sides though, right? You get locked into play area. I experienced

32:10.680 --> 32:18.120
that now. It's a necessary evil in many ways. That's interesting. It's like using gasoline.

32:18.120 --> 32:21.520
At the end of the day, you have to choose what's best for you and your condition, your

32:21.520 --> 32:27.240
situation. You can't have ideology around very critical aspects of your life. Yes. If

32:27.240 --> 32:32.920
you believe Android is better for certain reasons, you use that. But if iOS offers you

32:32.920 --> 32:37.720
something that you absolutely need, you can't just abandon it. You can't just ignore it

32:37.720 --> 32:43.240
because you believe in something. So I think you have to choose what's best for you at

32:43.240 --> 32:48.240
the end of the day. At the end, you know. That's rational. Yeah. Very rational point.

32:48.240 --> 32:56.320
I actually have a specific analogy that I use to describe an Apple product. It's akin

32:56.320 --> 33:02.680
to having a steak in your front yard and your chain to the steak on your front yard. And

33:02.680 --> 33:08.240
within this radius, you are happy. But if you ever want to get out of this radius, you

33:08.240 --> 33:14.400
will never, ever get out of this bubble. But in it, it's pretty. As soon as you ever want

33:14.400 --> 33:19.320
to go, you're screwed. Yeah. OK. I mean, I think but I feel like they both even like

33:19.320 --> 33:24.220
Blackberry does that to an extent. But what about my what about my issues around as a

33:24.220 --> 33:29.960
Linux user? I'm a little incensed that they're taking my baby and they're making it a whore,

33:29.960 --> 33:33.240
a two dime whore at that a two bit whore. I mean, do you get my way off on that? What

33:33.240 --> 33:39.720
do you guys think? Apache allows anything. But if we were going to get upset about what

33:39.720 --> 33:44.920
Tivo did, how come we're not upset about what this what's happening here? Because I think

33:44.920 --> 33:49.260
we're being I think Android and any any I won't even say Android, I think any passionate

33:49.260 --> 33:54.200
mobile operating system experience that we're passionate about spoon feeds us B.S. and sunshine

33:54.200 --> 33:58.520
to a point where we're fat, dumb and happy. And so regardless of what mobile platform

33:58.520 --> 34:03.400
you're in, if it involves an app store and some level of vendor lock in, you're so into

34:03.400 --> 34:07.220
that because you're enjoying the experience. You're really not interested or even that

34:07.220 --> 34:11.760
concerned about the negative side of it. I know I fall into that category. I'm I'm aware

34:11.760 --> 34:16.080
of it because I like to be educated. I just can't get myself to care enough to do anything

34:16.080 --> 34:19.440
about it. That's a terrible thing to say, but it's true. That's why I'm I'm happy with

34:19.440 --> 34:24.800
Android, despite knowing the fact that I've been indexed and doing decimal system by Google.

34:24.800 --> 34:30.120
I don't know. I almost feel like the rational thing to do when I when I sort of weigh all

34:30.120 --> 34:33.720
the pros and cons, I go into more depth on quarter radios, I kind of feel like jump off

34:33.720 --> 34:37.840
Android and wait for a couple of years for Firefox OS to get rockin. And, you know, wait

34:37.840 --> 34:41.600
for it to get a good messaging application, wait for it to get WebRTC integrated, wait

34:41.600 --> 34:46.840
for, you know, some kind of ecosystem to build up around it and then get a Firefox OS phone

34:46.840 --> 34:52.640
and then just be like, OK, I'm going to I'm going to live here. Or I'm going to. Yeah,

34:52.640 --> 34:56.680
in the meantime, civilization is important because a lot of TVs and embedded devices

34:56.680 --> 35:03.120
run Linux, whether we know or not, it's allowed the use of many like it to spread to many

35:03.120 --> 35:08.280
factors of our life without us even knowing our cars. It would never be able to be put

35:08.280 --> 35:13.840
in a what is that new electric awesome car there? Yeah, Tesla. Yeah, the Tesla. We'd

35:13.840 --> 35:19.560
never have the Tesla running Linux if it wasn't too visible. Right. You see the Tivo

35:19.560 --> 35:26.600
issue. Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. The Tivo issue is also Tivo never acknowledges Linux

35:26.600 --> 35:32.360
is there, whereas Google does actually acknowledge it, but just they don't market it. Yeah, but

35:32.360 --> 35:37.320
remember, I mean, remember what just happened with the Chromecast. I mean, that that's disappointing.

35:37.320 --> 35:42.840
That is not encouraging when it's just basically a bare Linux installation. I think it might

35:42.840 --> 35:47.880
have been a Buntu based or Google to base with a binary named Chromecast running or

35:47.880 --> 35:52.360
Gentoo. That's what it was Gentoo with a binary running. That's the Chromecast app.

35:52.360 --> 35:57.440
It was a Linux box. It's a Linux device. Why not promote that to make? I mean, because

35:57.440 --> 36:01.200
if they base their style, their stack on Linux, then doesn't it benefit them to show how Linux

36:01.200 --> 36:05.160
can be used in like all of these different use cases? Like, it seems like it's not just

36:05.160 --> 36:09.440
good for Linux, but it's good for them to not from a marketing perspective. If I'm not

36:09.440 --> 36:13.880
mistaken, it's a yeah, it is a marketing thing, right? The Chrome, the Chrome ideology that's

36:13.880 --> 36:18.640
easy to use. So if they call it a Chromecast, not like a Linux cast, it then sounds like

36:18.640 --> 36:24.240
it's this easy to use thing that sort of relates to the web. And so it relates to the Chrome

36:24.240 --> 36:27.480
streaming thing because a lot of what they do is they stream from the Chrome browser

36:27.480 --> 36:31.880
to that device. So they want to make it sound like the two products are linked is sort of

36:31.880 --> 36:32.880
my understanding.

36:32.880 --> 36:38.240
Yeah, right. Okay. From like a, okay, okay. Yeah. From like a, oh, I know what that is

36:38.240 --> 36:39.240
kind of standpoint.

36:39.240 --> 36:43.200
Well, to give you an example, I work for a company that recently went through a name

36:43.200 --> 36:46.480
change and of course the original name, no one ever heard of, but the brand name, people

36:46.480 --> 36:52.400
are well aware of it. And you know, we don't, all the branding efforts go into the flagship

36:52.400 --> 36:57.080
product name and the flagship brand name versus the tech, the underlying technology behind

36:57.080 --> 37:01.680
it, because honestly no one cares. Geeks might care, but Joe user doesn't give a flying rip.

37:01.680 --> 37:04.960
Yeah. I mean, a lot of windows users, you ask them, well, what version of windows you

37:04.960 --> 37:07.600
have? I don't know. I got the one that came on my computer. They don't have a clue. I

37:07.600 --> 37:11.480
have an HP or I have a Dell. You know, that's, that's the brand that they've been taught

37:11.480 --> 37:15.200
to associate with. So I think that's the same thing with Google.

37:15.200 --> 37:20.000
And there's still, there's still that, that, you know, mindset that, oh, it runs Linux.

37:20.000 --> 37:24.520
Oh, it's, it's, you know, you know, just for hackers, it's just for command line and all

37:24.520 --> 37:30.160
this other stuff. And which is obviously wrong, but yeah, you get a windows power user aware

37:30.160 --> 37:32.560
of it and then they're start spreading thought everywhere. Absolutely.

37:32.560 --> 37:33.560
Yeah.

37:33.560 --> 37:37.560
Thing is, the thing about open source is that you don't actually have control over what

37:37.560 --> 37:42.280
somebody else does with it. If Rome disagrees with what Cinnamon is doing, they can stop

37:42.280 --> 37:48.420
it. If Ubuntu disagrees with what elementary OS is doing, they have no say in it. So similarly,

37:48.420 --> 37:54.240
if somebody takes a Linux kernel under the, under legal licenses or whatever, and does

37:54.240 --> 37:59.480
whatever to it, nobody else has a choice to, nobody else can stop it because it's open

37:59.480 --> 38:04.760
source. They have the option to modify it and use it as they see fit, you know.

38:04.760 --> 38:05.760
I agree.

38:05.760 --> 38:10.840
Okay. Let me give you another aspect of, of Android that's bothering me. And I've mentioned

38:10.840 --> 38:16.520
this before on previous shows, but it goes back to the original getting into the carriers.

38:16.520 --> 38:21.160
So let's hit the, let's hit the way back machine. Back when Jobs was still kicking it at Apple

38:21.160 --> 38:27.400
and in full evil Jobs force, he went around to every single carrier, starting with Verizon

38:27.400 --> 38:31.400
and said, here's our product. We'd like to sell it on your wireless network. And then

38:31.400 --> 38:35.380
as soon as the conversation got too great, we'd like to preload our applications and

38:35.380 --> 38:39.240
do things like carrier IQ. Does everybody in the chat room who's giving me a hard time

38:39.240 --> 38:43.300
about iOS being a spy device, does everybody remember carrier IQ? Because that got loaded

38:43.300 --> 38:46.440
up on our free phones and that was a nightmare. If you don't know what carrier IQ is, go

38:46.440 --> 38:52.140
Google that because your device probably still has it. So, so Apple said, no, go screw yourself.

38:52.140 --> 38:56.700
And they walked and they ended up going to the smallest wireless carrier in America.

38:56.700 --> 39:00.880
And that was singular. They were the small fry that everybody thought was a joke. And

39:00.880 --> 39:04.420
they were the only ones willing to take Apple up on their offer. And then we all know what

39:04.420 --> 39:09.600
happened to singular. They blew up and they became AT&T. And now to this day, Apple rolls

39:09.600 --> 39:13.400
into Verizon store and it's not shitted up with a bunch of Verizon apps. And when they

39:13.400 --> 39:18.760
roll into sprint, you don't get your sprint sports cast broadcasted to your iPhone, right?

39:18.760 --> 39:24.400
They still to this day say, go, go F yourself. And even in China, they just blew off a deal

39:24.400 --> 39:27.680
with the biggest manual with the biggest wireless carrier in China because they wanted to load

39:27.680 --> 39:32.680
it up with some crap. And Google has never, never had the balls to do that. In fact, Google

39:32.680 --> 39:37.980
sells it on the exact opposite, just like Ubuntu touch is going to. They sell it on

39:37.980 --> 39:42.320
shit it up all you want. And in fact, shit it up so bad, you can never get an update

39:42.320 --> 39:46.360
ever. You can have the top of the line number one Android phone, best built phone ever still

39:46.360 --> 39:50.800
being sold as a top of line phone and it will never get an update. We don't care. And that

39:50.800 --> 39:55.460
is a complete FU to the users. That is an FU that is disregarding every lesson we have

39:55.460 --> 39:59.240
learned about internet security, about software update, about platform maintenance and about

39:59.240 --> 40:02.240
being a good steward of a platform and pushing it forward so that way developers can take

40:02.240 --> 40:06.480
advantage of new features. They forfeited all of it just for market share because they

40:06.480 --> 40:11.840
want the information. And at the end of the day, that really upsets me. Oh yeah, no, I

40:11.840 --> 40:15.280
can understand being upset by it, but I think you got to understand the motivation behind

40:15.280 --> 40:20.280
it. Apple's motivation for doing that is not to benefit the user. It is because they're

40:20.280 --> 40:23.440
purist and they want it to have it their way and that's how they've always been. Think

40:23.440 --> 40:27.000
different. It's all about their approach. I agree, but doesn't that exactly line up

40:27.000 --> 40:31.320
with a customer's needs? In this case, not always. I mean, it can lead them down routes.

40:31.320 --> 40:34.240
No, it's definitely an important and it's an important thing that people need to know.

40:34.240 --> 40:37.240
I think that's an important differential that when people are making the decision what phone

40:37.240 --> 40:40.560
to get, they need to know this stuff. That's really important. I mean, basically, I feel

40:40.560 --> 40:45.160
like every Android device sold in the store should have a big warning label on it that

40:45.160 --> 40:50.080
says, warning in six months to a year. This will be a walking exploit in your pocket.

40:50.080 --> 40:54.480
This will not get updates. This is a security flaw. If you want a good device that's updated,

40:54.480 --> 40:59.520
please go to play.google.com and buy it there. Or check out CyanogenMod. I mean, every Android

40:59.520 --> 41:03.200
box needs to have that disclaimer because when I bought my Android device, I assumed

41:03.200 --> 41:06.760
I would at least get six months worth of updates. I got no idea. Maybe I will, maybe I won't,

41:06.760 --> 41:11.240
but you know what? Tomorrow, every freaking iPhone user for the last three years is getting

41:11.240 --> 41:15.640
iOS 7. And there's no reason Android can't do that.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.640
Well, and I suspect that...

41:16.640 --> 41:22.720
See, the thing about Apple is that they have the ability to tell the carriers to just bend

41:22.720 --> 41:26.360
them to their will, unlike Google who has it the other way around.

41:26.360 --> 41:29.640
That's crap. Google had that power. Google just didn't want to exercise it because they

41:29.640 --> 41:33.440
wanted the market share. They could have stuck to it. But you know what the other thing was

41:33.440 --> 41:36.560
is their product wasn't good enough. I mean, if we go back to the G1, let's be honest,

41:36.560 --> 41:37.560
that was not good enough.

41:37.560 --> 41:38.560
No, the G1 was garbage.

41:38.560 --> 41:41.440
It wasn't really until the Droid, right, that Android really was usable. I mean, that's

41:41.440 --> 41:42.440
when I switched.

41:42.440 --> 41:44.200
I suppose so, yes.

41:44.200 --> 41:48.280
So I mean, I feel like they torpedoed their users to compete with Apple.

41:48.280 --> 41:52.320
Well, and I think part of the difference is too is that Google is interested in their

41:52.320 --> 41:57.200
penetration into the market at all costs as much as possible. And that's their goal, market,

41:57.200 --> 42:03.920
market, market, market, market, where Apple is ideology, ideology, ideology. And in this

42:03.920 --> 42:09.280
particular case, it aligns with good user experience, and that's great. But I do agree

42:09.280 --> 42:16.480
with the whole disclosure thing. I think that's important. But I think that we got lucky with

42:16.480 --> 42:21.000
Apple in that it just happened to fall under our benefit. And maybe they're even smart

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
enough to realize that.

42:22.000 --> 42:26.720
I don't know. I think what Apple, I think honestly what did it in a big part was Steve

42:26.720 --> 42:32.960
Jobs wanted to be able to get everybody to push the latest features out. They wanted

42:32.960 --> 42:36.360
essentially this update thing because when you look at it right now, it's something like

42:36.360 --> 42:40.520
some ridiculous stat like distributor to the Android OS.

42:40.520 --> 42:43.560
This is the problem, though. They could have. They could have in the light. They could have

42:43.560 --> 42:47.320
structured the licensing the way Microsoft structures the Windows phone licensing where

42:47.320 --> 42:52.280
they allow for some time. But it was within the contract that they have to meet a certain

42:52.280 --> 42:56.840
window. And I think that would have been completely appropriate. And it's Microsoft learning from

42:56.840 --> 43:00.920
twenty five plus years in the PC licensing business had to handle this. And the reason

43:00.920 --> 43:03.880
why Apple wanted to have a pristine OS on there is that way they could push out the

43:03.880 --> 43:08.320
updates. And the reason isn't just security because it probably isn't their primary motivator.

43:08.320 --> 43:12.860
The reason is, is because they want developers to target the new features, which is a massive

43:12.860 --> 43:17.280
train wreck on Android. And they're now beginning to fix it with the play API, which is, by

43:17.280 --> 43:20.940
the way, completely closed source. So great. They're fixing this fragmentation problem

43:20.940 --> 43:23.720
with more closed source software. Yay, Google, way to go.

43:23.720 --> 43:28.200
So in the meantime, every every like it's like something like ninety five percent of

43:28.200 --> 43:34.680
iPhones run the latest OS that gives developers this massive opportunity for creating brand

43:34.680 --> 43:38.600
new feature rich applications that take advantage of everything these new OS is and phones can

43:38.600 --> 43:43.640
do. That isn't that is not as optional on Android. And it is just yet another. It's

43:43.640 --> 43:47.400
not so it's not just the security thing. It's the feature is the end user. And it's about

43:47.400 --> 43:51.120
getting the investment out of my six hundred dollar device.

43:51.120 --> 43:54.680
I would agree. I would even go so far as to say I suspect at some point you're going to

43:54.680 --> 43:59.200
see toward individual hardware manufacturers a couple of class action lawsuits. I'd say

43:59.200 --> 44:05.240
the odds are fairly reasonable in that regard, just because there's not there's a lot of

44:05.240 --> 44:07.880
marketing promises that make it sound like this is going to constantly be updated when

44:07.880 --> 44:11.160
in fact that's not the case. That's for a court to decide. I don't know. But I suspect

44:11.160 --> 44:14.200
that it's probably going to end up taking care of itself at some point because eventually

44:14.200 --> 44:18.360
people will have enough and will have to make that decision of, wow, not buying that. I'm

44:18.360 --> 44:22.020
not buying HTC again or I'm not buying Motorola again or whatever it may be. They're going

44:22.020 --> 44:27.000
to have to make those choices, you know, based on those experiences must have, you know,

44:27.000 --> 44:33.760
an update repository. So then future phones will fill this void of like security void.

44:33.760 --> 44:38.400
They will eventually have repositories that you can say update the kernel or operating

44:38.400 --> 44:43.720
system. But right now it's a void. That's up to Google if they want to do that or not.

44:43.720 --> 44:48.120
Well, here's an interesting idea that dream dream points out, like if HTC one sold me

44:48.120 --> 44:56.760
like this overall not warranty, but like if I could pay HTC $35 or whatever, kind of like,

44:56.760 --> 45:01.720
you know, you go buy a new, you know, a new OS. If I could buy the new OS for my HTC one,

45:01.720 --> 45:06.960
like I would buy it for a computer. Sure. I would do that. I would totally do that.

45:06.960 --> 45:11.620
And I think that would actually be not an ideal solution, but it's totally what I would.

45:11.620 --> 45:15.720
It's at least a workable solution. When I think squeaky wheel gets the grease. I think

45:15.720 --> 45:20.720
if P if we, if people continue to educate non aware folks of this situation to where

45:20.720 --> 45:25.120
they can then become noisy about it, then I think we might begin seeing these changes,

45:25.120 --> 45:27.700
but I think that's the thing. The best thing we can do right now is to make people aware

45:27.700 --> 45:30.600
of it. Not to say you should go one direction or the other, but to be like, Hey, by the

45:30.600 --> 45:35.360
way, when you're buying your phone, are you asking these questions on, are you implementing

45:35.360 --> 45:38.620
that into your decision? Cause I think that's an important thing to do, but you can have

45:38.620 --> 45:42.680
company company a company B company C and they're all going to have different business

45:42.680 --> 45:49.640
models. Um, the way that they're successful is, um, either they have great marketing and

45:49.640 --> 45:55.380
or, um, their, their, uh, business plan or their, their direction aligns with customers

45:55.380 --> 45:59.040
needs and wants, um, or they just have a fantastic product.

45:59.040 --> 46:05.680
Right. It'll be nice as if Google in their contract, like with HTC and Samsung said after

46:05.680 --> 46:09.240
a year, you know, you have to release X to the community so that way they can maintain

46:09.240 --> 46:16.000
or something because no, well, no, I mean, I think a Cyanogen mod and Google play devices

46:16.000 --> 46:19.880
and nexus devices are not a good enough answer because they only apply to the people that

46:19.880 --> 46:22.820
are in our IRC and on this mumble server and listening to this podcast. They don't apply

46:22.820 --> 46:27.120
to our, you know, to the immediate group outside the tech circle.

46:27.120 --> 46:31.600
There is a solution to that though. Like, like with, for example, neck nexus devices

46:31.600 --> 46:36.000
could, if they, the reason people don't buy nexus devices is because they're too expensive

46:36.000 --> 46:40.260
and they're not even that expensive. They're like an extra 150, 100 maybe. But if you,

46:40.260 --> 46:45.240
if they had a plan where you could buy the, the nexus devices from Google on a monthly

46:45.240 --> 46:49.480
basis, just kind of like the jump plans or something like that, then a lot of people

46:49.480 --> 46:53.960
would see that as a much better option. And then people would have phones that are not,

46:53.960 --> 46:57.760
that are not like mine where it took 18 months to get an update.

46:57.760 --> 47:01.520
Yes. However, I don't think Google can actually do that because that would require them to

47:01.520 --> 47:05.620
sell the phone through the carrier and the carrier is not going to want them to not put

47:05.620 --> 47:07.000
the carrier software on there.

47:07.000 --> 47:10.520
It all comes back to that original deal. It all hinges on that.

47:10.520 --> 47:14.800
That is why Google sells the phone separately. I'm convinced. And I think all of this goes

47:14.800 --> 47:20.720
back to the evolution of the smartphone market. Apple with Steve Jobs took a risk by not selling

47:20.720 --> 47:25.000
it to these carriers that wanted to put their crapware on it. And I think because he was

47:25.000 --> 47:30.000
the, they were the first ones to the market that they had the ability to say no and not

47:30.000 --> 47:33.480
just, you know, install the crapware and go for market penetration because they were there

47:33.480 --> 47:38.160
pretty much first. They were able to do that and as soon as they rose to power, now they

47:38.160 --> 47:43.880
have the market by the balls and they can say, well, Verizon, they're selling, you know,

47:43.880 --> 47:49.440
the iPhone in massive quantities over at AT&T. If you want to sell it, you can't put your

47:49.440 --> 47:53.620
crapware on it. And they sort of have Verizon by the balls now because they don't want customers

47:53.620 --> 47:54.620
to go to AT&T.

47:54.620 --> 47:57.080
Yeah, it took them like two to three years to get them on Verizon.

47:57.080 --> 48:01.260
And so I think that's how they had the handle, whereas Google came late to the party just

48:01.260 --> 48:04.960
like Ubuntu phone is. And now they really need to cater to the carrier so that they

48:04.960 --> 48:09.440
can push their phone everywhere and try and gain market capitalization. Whereas Apple

48:09.440 --> 48:10.440
already had this.

48:10.440 --> 48:15.000
I mean, we see what Google had to do reflected in what Ubuntu touch has to do only magnified,

48:15.000 --> 48:18.700
right? I mean, they have this massive carrier advisory group and they're literally pitching

48:18.700 --> 48:22.680
it as carrier custom as a carrier customizable platform where you slot in your own services.

48:22.680 --> 48:27.000
In fact, one of the quote unquote features is that you can put your own app store in

48:27.000 --> 48:30.480
there. You can put your own, you know, media back into it.

48:30.480 --> 48:31.840
That sounds worse than Google.

48:31.840 --> 48:37.840
Yeah, exactly. It does. It does. It does. And I guess the thing is I have to ask myself

48:37.840 --> 48:42.680
is if, if we're getting to the point where, uh, for some of us, like, you know, we could

48:42.680 --> 48:46.840
get the nexus devices, you know, and we can get the signage and mods and we can make buy,

48:46.840 --> 48:52.320
we can make do we're fortunate like that, but what do we do for everybody else? Like,

48:52.320 --> 48:56.200
I mean, this is a problem where I feel like, I don't know, because I see an opportunity

48:56.200 --> 49:03.200
for a business and or a, or a nonprofit foundation, one of the other, and it sounds like they're

49:03.200 --> 49:07.920
trying to go back and retroactively fix this by making all of their Google applications

49:07.920 --> 49:09.520
a separate package from the OS now.

49:09.520 --> 49:10.520
Right.

49:10.520 --> 49:13.480
And it sounds like, you know, they acknowledge that they kind of screwed up on the deal where

49:13.480 --> 49:18.440
they let carriers and let vendors customize the phone OS and now they want to distribute

49:18.440 --> 49:22.600
their apps separately and that controls most of the software functionality on the phone.

49:22.600 --> 49:26.720
So now you can get updates to most of the core applications. Yeah. You still can't get

49:26.720 --> 49:31.200
complete core OS updates. You can't get kernel updates necessarily, but at least you get

49:31.200 --> 49:32.320
the Google apps.

49:32.320 --> 49:37.080
And you get some security updates, but not necessarily all security. Yeah. It's not a

49:37.080 --> 49:38.080
good, it's not a good solution.

49:38.080 --> 49:41.540
At least you get the Chrome browser updates, right? I mean, I think that's probably one

49:41.540 --> 49:45.280
of the most important things that they're going to be giving out with that.

49:45.280 --> 49:48.240
But I think if enough geeks get passionate about this enough to where they want to come

49:48.240 --> 49:53.440
together and they want to look at the more open source, you know, centric solutions,

49:53.440 --> 49:56.880
like what you're talking about in our community, if that gets to be loud and scary enough and

49:56.880 --> 50:01.960
enough people care, I think eventually you're going to see some entity catering to that

50:01.960 --> 50:02.960
at some level.

50:02.960 --> 50:06.160
It's not going to appeal to Joe average, but to, you know, to people, to geeks that do

50:06.160 --> 50:08.600
care about these things, you know, I think it'll take care of itself.

50:08.600 --> 50:12.400
So then why do we have, so all of this sounds completely reasonable. So then why do we have

50:12.400 --> 50:19.760
things in our community like Ubuntu shame, iPhone shame? Why do we, why is there this,

50:19.760 --> 50:25.360
why is there this lack of critical analysis on Google and, and why is there this sort

50:25.360 --> 50:30.780
of pre pretty, um, assumption that, uh, you know, somebody must be an idiot if they're

50:30.780 --> 50:34.880
using the iPhone, they must be because we're it's honestly, and pardon my French, but we're

50:34.880 --> 50:39.720
fart sniffers, uh, geeks as a whole, you know, especially Android geeks and, and they are,

50:39.720 --> 50:44.480
it's like, well, you know, clearly I'm, I know what I'm doing. You're an idiot. Um,

50:44.480 --> 50:48.860
well clearly I, I see the benefits and the, and the functionality benefits of using the

50:48.860 --> 50:52.880
platform I'm using and I'm, I'm, I'm their king in that regard. Cause I look at Android

50:52.880 --> 50:56.240
and then I look at iPhone and I'm like, yeah, right. I can understand that. Yeah. And so

50:56.240 --> 50:59.920
that I get in that mindset. And so I will be your representative, you know, tool bag

50:59.920 --> 51:03.720
here and pointing out that I walk around looking at iPhone, yours is going, Oh God, why the

51:03.720 --> 51:07.860
hell would you use that? Not really stopping to consider there are in fact some advantages

51:07.860 --> 51:12.520
to it. And I'm, I'm definitely guilty of that. So I think that as a whole, as a community,

51:12.520 --> 51:19.520
a lot of Android folks do fall into that, you know, but I did use an iPhone for a long

51:19.520 --> 51:22.720
time so I can back it up and not just say, I'm just talking to Android. I, you know,

51:22.720 --> 51:28.740
I used to, you know, I, I, I've been, I walked that path. It had its preferences in your

51:28.740 --> 51:33.600
needs and you're going to use what fits your needs. Not because it's popular. I mean, I

51:33.600 --> 51:38.800
know people go out and buy new phones because the new hotness, but it's, it's, it's, it's

51:38.800 --> 51:44.040
what, it's what you need. And, and people as us as a community or not, maybe not us,

51:44.040 --> 51:48.760
but people in general should really just stop hating on other people just for the sake of

51:48.760 --> 51:52.600
hating out other people because they're using something different or look down on instead

51:52.600 --> 51:56.480
of the grass is always greener. The grass is always Browner on the other side.

51:56.480 --> 51:59.720
I think for geeks and our people in our community, I think that's absolutely true. I think for

51:59.720 --> 52:06.400
Joe average, I would absolutely say 120% people buy the latest idiot thing on the television.

52:06.400 --> 52:09.800
Just average people. I see it all the time with the young, my nephews, poster child.

52:09.800 --> 52:13.160
Oh my God, you see that one phone? I don't even know what the hell it does, but God,

52:13.160 --> 52:16.400
it looks great. I got to get it. You know, you got those types of folks as well.

52:16.400 --> 52:17.400
Yeah.

52:17.400 --> 52:20.960
Non tech savvy people purchasing new hardware that they, they don't really know what's,

52:20.960 --> 52:21.960
what's going on.

52:21.960 --> 52:22.960
You don't even need it.

52:22.960 --> 52:23.960
Yeah.

52:23.960 --> 52:27.000
Things like that. Or here, here does, here's something that, that doesn't really help,

52:27.000 --> 52:33.400
the case is you have the marketing, the commercials that's that, what was it? I think it was one

52:33.400 --> 52:39.080
of the Samsung's commercials that was showing like the old folks in line waiting for the

52:39.080 --> 52:40.080
iPhone.

52:40.080 --> 52:41.080
That was awesome.

52:41.080 --> 52:42.080
Yeah.

52:42.080 --> 52:43.080
Yeah.

52:43.080 --> 52:45.760
And that, and that's kids pay attention to that. Believe me, they really do. You ask

52:45.760 --> 52:51.080
my nephew, he's 16 years old. Would you want a brand new iPhone or would you want my used

52:51.080 --> 52:55.320
note too? There is not even a conversation there. He wants the note too, because that's

52:55.320 --> 52:59.200
what he's been told is awesome. He's been told the iPhone is something dinosaurs use.

52:59.200 --> 53:00.200
Well, all right.

53:00.200 --> 53:03.200
And it sucks, but you know.

53:03.200 --> 53:06.440
As far as the geek community goes, I think there's a stigma attached with something popular

53:06.440 --> 53:11.680
because I mean, what I'm saying is Ubuntu is popular. Apple, iOS is popular. That's

53:11.680 --> 53:16.040
why we must hate it. We must always root for Luke Skywalker, the underdog.

53:16.040 --> 53:18.800
That's true. Yeah. That's an interesting perspective. I'm considering that.

53:18.800 --> 53:23.160
Yeah, perhaps. I think, I think I want to, you know, I think maybe for a future conversation,

53:23.160 --> 53:27.560
I want to talk about how a lot of these open platforms ended up saving their data back

53:27.560 --> 53:32.920
to closed source programs and platforms that are really generally meant for tracking users.

53:32.920 --> 53:35.160
But I think that could be a conversation for a future episode.

53:35.160 --> 53:36.160
Yeah.

53:36.160 --> 53:39.080
All right guys. Well, good on you. Thanks for kicking that around. And I, you know,

53:39.080 --> 53:46.200
I leave it, I leave it kind of buttoned up with, you know, I'm left with, I try to find

53:46.200 --> 53:51.800
the Zen of the situation and tell myself that honestly the HTC One, which is running 4.1.2

53:51.800 --> 53:55.000
has everything I need. Really. I mean, there's nothing like in the new updates that I have

53:55.000 --> 53:59.800
to have and I'm, I'm trying to be careful. Although I did just get recently bit with,

53:59.800 --> 54:05.440
with spyware crap, but I try to be careful and studious. And so it's not really functionally,

54:05.440 --> 54:08.400
it's you know, if there, if there was something really confidential and secret that I didn't

54:08.400 --> 54:10.840
want logged by Google, I'd probably just not put it on my phone.

54:10.840 --> 54:15.560
Well, and as someone as myself, who is, I would say I'm reasonably new to Android, so

54:15.560 --> 54:20.560
I can still be kind of a newbie in this regard. What's your view on things like lookout and,

54:20.560 --> 54:23.560
and anti, you know, security software? Is it crap?

54:23.560 --> 54:26.560
No, I mean, no, I mean, I've tried it. I had a,

54:26.560 --> 54:29.560
Cause I have no idea. I mean like, this is all new to me.

54:29.560 --> 54:33.320
No, I, I used one of those programs actually to clean it up. I had a, I have a program

54:33.320 --> 54:36.200
on here that scans it and it went through and found and cleaned it up for me. So I mean,

54:36.200 --> 54:41.360
they don't seem to be totally, totally a waste of it. It seems so ridiculous. I guess.

54:41.360 --> 54:44.080
It is. Yeah. And that's what puts all the overhead on my old phone. You know, you were

54:44.080 --> 54:46.520
talking about how it was slow. That's, that's where a lot of the overhead comes from is

54:46.520 --> 54:49.680
running lookout. And I, and it's, it's seemed to have kept my phone. It actually caught

54:49.680 --> 54:53.040
me from keeping a few things off my phone. As a matter of fact, I remember when I switched

54:53.040 --> 54:56.800
cause I, I, I followed the same path that you followed. I even tried windows phone,

54:56.800 --> 55:02.320
you know, like the old, I had an old HTC windows phone that was just like this ridiculous joke.

55:02.320 --> 55:05.520
And so when the iPhone came, I was impressed and I got like the, I didn't buy the first

55:05.520 --> 55:09.760
one cause I was like, no way I'm going to buy first gen Apple, anything. And I think

55:09.760 --> 55:15.200
I got like the, the three GS. I can't remember. I got somewhere around in there and I remember

55:15.200 --> 55:18.680
thinking it was pretty good and I waited until the droid came out on Verizon. And then when

55:18.680 --> 55:23.600
the droid came out, I remember switching and thinking, God, this feels like an actual computer.

55:23.600 --> 55:28.620
Like this is, this is like, you know, and that was my feeling. So I, Android fits my

55:28.620 --> 55:34.920
user style. My, the style, I'm a, I'm a power user. Android fits that better. And I have

55:34.920 --> 55:38.780
options out there like Cyanogen mod, you know, just like I can use encryption to, and I can

55:38.780 --> 55:43.360
use bid message or whatever. Right? Like I have all these options. I just, I wish that

55:43.360 --> 55:46.040
when we just stop at the end of the day, I wish we would just think more critically about

55:46.040 --> 55:51.520
some of it. Well, and I'm holding out a lot of hope more and more for Firefox OS. I really

55:51.520 --> 55:56.680
want to see this be the solution with a company behind it. That's going to keep the value.

55:56.680 --> 56:00.960
Even if Firefox OS is great. You've got, you've got a couple of years of, oh, it's going to

56:00.960 --> 56:04.440
be a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. You got a couple of years. But I'm holding out hope longterm.

56:04.440 --> 56:08.200
I'm thinking long game here. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, I want to read a couple of emails

56:08.200 --> 56:12.800
before we run. Peter wrote into the show. He says, hi Matt and Chris. I just backed

56:12.800 --> 56:18.680
a zero AD on Indiegogo and then later had my credit card compromised by a payment made

56:18.680 --> 56:22.760
to Samsung telecom in the US. That's pretty strange since I'm based out of the UK and

56:22.760 --> 56:27.560
I've had no other US transactions except for Indiegogo. Who knows? He says, but by the

56:27.560 --> 56:31.200
way, I also moved to mint 15 and the Chrome browser on all my machines. Steam was the

56:31.200 --> 56:36.400
last thing holding me back from Linux. I don't think Linux games are cheap or gamers are

56:36.400 --> 56:39.760
cheap going back to our conversation from a few episodes ago. In my case, I already

56:39.760 --> 56:45.320
own most of the games. Yeah. And then of course when he moved over, he just downloaded them

56:45.320 --> 56:49.520
on the Linux version. And what we kind of sussed out, I don't remember how we got to

56:49.520 --> 56:54.920
the bottom of this. I think somebody wrote into the show. Steam, it's not just the survey.

56:54.920 --> 57:00.540
So steam collects usage stats via that survey, but then also after you've played a game on

57:00.540 --> 57:04.640
a certain operating system, after a certain amount of time, it also then logs you on that

57:04.640 --> 57:10.840
operating system. So if you have a bunch of games that you bought on the Windows side,

57:10.840 --> 57:14.280
all of those purchases are counted for Windows. And then when you move over to Linux, which

57:14.280 --> 57:18.320
probably some people are doing, and you redownload them, it's not until you've played each one

57:18.320 --> 57:22.240
of those games for a certain amount of time that they're still counted as a Linux user.

57:22.240 --> 57:26.800
Oh, so that's a double whammy then. Okay. And then he had a question after being bit

57:26.800 --> 57:30.940
by that credit card problem they had. He said, can you guys recommend what internet security

57:30.940 --> 57:35.720
software I should be using on the now sinking windows platform? I used a combination of

57:35.720 --> 57:40.960
McAfee and spy bot surgeon destroy. Thanks in advance, Peter. So is he asking about security

57:40.960 --> 57:47.680
software for Linux or Linux? Uh, well, I would, I mean, not a good firewall. Yeah. So here's

57:47.680 --> 57:52.400
what I would say. Don't run his route, which you, which you're not probably on a mint 15

57:52.400 --> 57:57.000
and um, use really good passwords everywhere. Maybe use something like key pass or last

57:57.000 --> 58:00.680
pass. My personal favorite don't execute random commands or random binaries or things

58:00.680 --> 58:05.520
of that sort. I would say the most important security precaution you could take on Linux

58:05.520 --> 58:10.680
is don't run random binaries, like Matt just said, and used a different password for every

58:10.680 --> 58:15.180
website. Yeah. Yeah. That's really, Oh, and uh, don't, don't install Java. That would

58:15.180 --> 58:19.080
be another, you know what? Yeah. Don't, don't, don't use Java unless you need to. Yeah. And

58:19.080 --> 58:22.480
don't bother with the browser plugin if you don't need to. Right. Don't. Yeah. That's

58:22.480 --> 58:29.120
a good one. Why not? Um, and, and then like in the chat, in the chat, keep your updates,

58:29.120 --> 58:32.600
keep your, you know, stay current with the OS updates. And when mint 15 stops getting

58:32.600 --> 58:36.640
updates, you know, just remember that on mint, you're going to do a full reload and you're

58:36.640 --> 58:39.080
going to upgrade. You're not, there's not an upgrade path. You're going to load the

58:39.080 --> 58:42.280
next version. But I mean, let's be honest. Sometimes it's good to start clean. If you're

58:42.280 --> 58:45.040
really, really concerned about, you know, that's the elephant in the room of course

58:45.040 --> 58:48.760
is people surf about content. If you're going to be one of those guys and really, I, as

58:48.760 --> 58:54.280
a guy, yeah, I dealt with a lot of men, a lot of married men that came in begging for

58:54.280 --> 58:58.920
help and I actually had a special program for them. It's called the live CD or the live

58:58.920 --> 59:05.640
USB without writeable options. I'm telling you, what about like a porn VM? I never thought

59:05.640 --> 59:09.860
about this. I just thought of a great business. Like totally just go all QVC with it. Right?

59:09.860 --> 59:14.720
Like a porn VM that lives inside a true Crip volume, right? Okay. So I've come into, Oh,

59:14.720 --> 59:19.640
are you busted again? He's all, Oh, now you can have another, here's the pitch. Now you

59:19.640 --> 59:25.800
can have another computer in your computer and it's encrypted, right? Call it the porn

59:25.800 --> 59:29.920
box and it's based on virtual box.

59:29.920 --> 59:37.240
Oh my God. I'm on this. This is going to happen. This is the next moneymaker. I have no ethics.

59:37.240 --> 59:42.400
Yeah, let's do it. All right. Distributed via bit torrent, right? Um, all right. Uh,

59:42.400 --> 59:45.640
so I had it, let's see, I think I didn't, I have another one. I just accidentally closed

59:45.640 --> 59:49.960
it. Um, Oh man, I'm a bad person. I'm a bad person. I just closed the other email. Sorry

59:49.960 --> 59:53.640
about that. But I'll look for it. Okay. And I got off on a tangent. I got all excited,

59:53.640 --> 59:56.440
talking about Peron. It gets me going. I didn't have a big message. It's here. So here's the

59:56.440 --> 01:00:00.160
arch challenge. Follow up. This came from Carl and he says, hi Chris and Matt. I started

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:03.880
to watch the show about three months ago and I've been a fan ever since. I know I'm a bit

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:08.000
late to the arch challenge, but I wanted to mention it anyways. First, I should say that

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:13.120
the first Linux I installed was Slackware 2.0. Hmm. Okay. So that's, that's, that's

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:19.960
quite a while ago, but, Oh, this is where it takes this work. There's always a, but,

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:26.160
but after moving to Apple for a good 10 years, I forgot most of it. Uh, anyway, I saw the

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:30.560
episode with the arch challenge and I thought, yeah, I should give it a go. So I did install

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.120
of arch and when I first came out and got it started, I was a little disappointed when

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:38.480
I found out there wasn't an installer. Okay. Yeah. So I'm kind of, well, there isn't, there

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:43.160
isn't, I'll get into that. Should we have not, I mean, there isn't a separate ISO, but

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:47.660
yeah, not officially. I just, I didn't, when we did the arch challenge, I didn't mean for

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:52.200
somebody that to take the arch challenge that was at that level. Yeah, right. Because like,

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.800
if you didn't know that about arch, I didn't whether it was intended for you. So I'm impressed

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:59.360
that he went for it, especially after living on the Mac for 10 years. So good on, good

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:04.440
on you, Carl. So he goes on to say, I did the arch install and, um, after, after three

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:10.440
tries I succeeded and now I'm running arch. Uh, and he's sticking with it. The bad point

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:13.880
about this, and here's the downside he says to arch and, and actually I have found this

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:17.760
to be the major disadvantage to arch too. And I'm wondering if you agree, Matt, uh,

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:21.120
he says the bad point is now he can't go back to any of the distro because there's no match

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.120
for arch.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:27.800
Uh, you know, I would say that for, it depends on the person. For me, I dual booted arch

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:32.320
and Manjaro for a long time. And just because I wanted to really understand what that was

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:36.520
going to be like. Yeah. From a meta standpoint, I consider arch, Manjaro, Linux, all that

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:40.400
to kind of be the, yeah, I did, I did found some distinct, there's definitely some differences.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.920
There's definitely some differences. I would absolutely say Manjaro is totally not arch.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:48.640
It just happens to share some similarities. Is that bit you now? Did that bite you in

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:49.640
the butt?

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:53.440
Um, honestly, no. I, you know, I, you know, with arch I just kind of, it's, I think it's

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:56.280
actually stolen the partition. It's hardly ever used it. But with Manjaro, it's like

01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:59.560
all the stuff that I was reading that was negative or they screwed this up or screwed

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:03.240
that up. As long as you're on the mailing list and you pay attention, you know, I mean,

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:07.280
and they, and, and yes, it is officially they say it's arch, but there's some, they use

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:11.760
their own repos. There's a lot of things that they do do completely differently. Age software,

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:15.160
that sort of thing. But it's kind of like for it's, you know, like it's arch for people

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:20.420
don't care, care about security. I would say it's for people that don't really aren't paranoid

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.920
about security. I'd say it's a more accurate statement. Yes, it's, it's often a month or

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.400
two older, but I've probably still fresher than a lot of distros. And on all these horror

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:33.560
stories I've read are generally, there's never anything to really back up an actual use case

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:38.040
scenario. So based on my own usage, I would say that arch is awesome. And if you want

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:42.400
to go that route, go that. But as far as men, Gerald being scary, a bullshit, I'm sorry.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.280
It's just that I, you know, I look at it, I have a single problem with it. Oh, neither

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:47.280
with arch either.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:52.240
So you and I have been, um, um, you and I off, off, uh, off camera and talked a little

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:57.320
bit recently about preparing for the Ubuntu 1310 review. Yeah. And the problem I have

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:02.640
with it is, uh, now I got a good way to do this because I've got on the bonobos, I've

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:08.200
got USB three and I got a, um, I got a USB three, a one terabyte drive. And it's one

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:13.720
of those hybrid drives that has SSD and, and, and then the, so it's, it's pretty fast and

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:18.320
I'll load Ubuntu on that. And you know, I'll, I'll be fine. I'm not looking forward to it

01:03:18.320 --> 01:03:22.080
at all. And not because, I mean, honestly, I remember I used to run it. That was my previous

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:25.880
distro, but what it really is for me. And I know I've said this a lot and it's so funny

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:31.700
because it's what I was like, what's a, you are, that's what I was like, you are no dude.

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:36.800
It's all about the AUR. It's all about it because at the end of the day, Katie is Katie.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.520
Gnome is gnome. It doesn't matter what, you know, you put, you put your theme on it. You

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:43.920
set your background, you load your favorite apps. They're all the same. Yeah. But the

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:48.360
AUR buddy, I mean like, you know, that was, that was it for it for me. And that's what,

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.080
you know, let's say Majuro disappears tomorrow. That's not a big deal. I still got the arch

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:55.280
installs roll back to it. No biggie that for me, it was the AUR experience that I cared

01:03:55.280 --> 01:04:00.320
about. I, the, the arch way is awesome. I just don't care. Um, you know, what I cared

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:04.960
about was the, you know, the arch user repository. That's what sold me on the experience in general,

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.600
whether it be whatever it is, you know, what, whatever the distro is that happens to embrace

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:13.480
that as seamlessly. Hey Matt. Yeah. Uh, president Obama's here. He, hello everybody. Uh, he

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:17.800
wanted me to make a point that, uh, he wanted me to mention that Gentoo is awesome and the

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:24.480
Gentoo is incredible. Um, there we have fulfilled our duty. If our president says that it's

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.800
awesome and clearly, you know, I guess Obama's, I guess Obama's a big Gentoo user. Who knew

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:32.120
you'd think he'd be busier than that. You thought he was an apple guy, but you know,

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:36.240
this is good to know. Uh, he also says, by the way, he's loving the new show. And, uh,

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:40.600
he also just wanted to point out that he liked the Star Trek segment. Oh, no kidding. Oh,

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:44.280
he's a Star Trek fan. We got a Star Trek fan. We got a Star Trek fan. And he said that in

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.760
Carl, something to be a bit message. Uh, and we have the bit message address in the Linux

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.880
action show show notes. Um, I'm going to just, uh, mumble room, just one quick, uh, shout

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.700
to you guys. If there's anything you guys want to touch on, if anybody had last thing

01:04:55.700 --> 01:05:00.400
on the tip of their tongue before we run, uh, now is your chance. I wanted to say was,

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:07.160
uh, why can't system 76 just make phones and put whatever we want on it. I'm saying, I'm

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:15.600
thinking more like a tablet. I think a tablet, it would be awesome. Tablet. Yeah. You know,

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:20.080
I'm kind of, there would be a use for Nome three and Ubuntu and unity and all that. I,

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.400
I, you know, one of the things, one of the things we got a little, a little, a little

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:27.240
S for last week, Matt was, we talked about that. Remember that block phone where like

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:33.840
each thing, that's where I'm, that's where that with Firefox OS. Oh yeah. I mean, I

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:37.520
have to be honest. I mean, I, I acknowledge that's pretty unpractical that that thing's

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.960
going to ship. And even when it did ship, like it might not really work out really that

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.720
well, but I love to just think about that in a different way. And when you think about

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:51.400
a hardware platform like that, I mean, one of the things that really makes me sad about

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:56.160
is apparently a self fulfilling prophecy of the post PC era because PC manufacturers can't

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:59.160
figure out how to make computers. People want to actually spend their money on. I love the

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:03.560
idea that we all pretend like we haven't just had this global economic meltdown and that

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.880
nobody's got as much money as they used to have. And that everybody in the, in, at least

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:10.680
in the middle class that is the, is the bulk of people who buy these machines is struggling.

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:13.840
But let's all pretend like instead it's tablets that's causing the sales to drop down right

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.760
now. It's the fact that everybody's money is a little more precious and I'm not going

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:20.920
to spend it unless you give me something to pay for that I really, really want. It's more

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:25.040
about value. So instead they make these cheap tablets. That's fine. Whatever. I'm not going

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:29.960
to get all worked up about it. But what, what pains me about the loss of the PC is this

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:36.240
build it yourself if you want option and load any OS you want option. And I want that same

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:40.040
and that's what I loved about the block phone, right? I mean, even if it doesn't happen,

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:45.920
I love that it was just making us think about a future where that kind of possibility existed

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:49.000
where you have the choice of deciding not only what hardware is going to go into it,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.200
but also what operating system and what software you're going to plug into it to where you,

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:56.720
if you, if something screws up, it was your fault because you did it. Right? That's awesome.

01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:01.760
Democracy of a phone. Yeah, exactly. Right. Exactly. Yeah. I have a question. How is it

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:05.720
going to be different than how is it now? Because you still, I mean, if it's a lot easier

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:13.280
to install cyanogen or whatever on it, you still have a 95% users being windows and you

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:18.160
know, just like that, you still have a certain percentage being Android, certain percentage

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:23.400
being iOS. If you want to load another OS, you still have to do a lot of work. You have

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:28.280
to install it yourself. So we'd be back in the same position. If that's where other third

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:32.480
party companies will come in. That's what I'm thinking. Those little stores down the

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:36.680
road that would unlock your phone. It would say, do you want to try something else? We'll

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:42.600
do it for you overnight if you like, or in the next, whatever. Exactly. Well, I mean,

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:47.520
think about going back to system 76, you could have vendors like system 76 that take the

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:51.240
hardware and do the custom builder, do they take an OEM product and they create a solution

01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:55.560
around it. And then they, they put the OS that that market wants, right? And then they

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:59.320
support it and they back it up and they build a whole business around it. You could have

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:05.560
that. So yes, I mean, so are you taking this to Danica then? There's a, here's a new business

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:12.560
idea. Yeah, I like that. Why would that, why hasn't that happened? I mean, that hasn't

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:17.080
happened on PCs yet. Why would that be more possible on the phone? Isn't, isn't aren't

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:23.160
companies like system 76 and za reason, um, examples of that happening? Yes. Right. But

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:28.080
they're not as popular. They're nowhere near as popular as they should be or could be.

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:32.920
Windows still controls the market. Linux is still 1%. I mean, windows Vista has more market

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:37.080
share. Well, I mean, it would shut us all up though, wouldn't it? We're going to have

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:41.420
to be moaning about this. We just move over to a system 76 or there's actually something

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:47.520
out now called the open moco device. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah, I, I, I think some

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:52.080
of this, I mean, we got to scratch our Gabe beards here for a second and look at his conference

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.280
keynote that he just gave that we're going to talk about more on Sunday. Uh, you know,

01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:59.640
he says the Linux is the future of gaming. I don't, I mean, who knows if he's right,

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:05.200
but I've been saying now for a while that as Microsoft just continues to screw it up

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.680
real bad and they're going to just keep screwing it up because they have to, because that's

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.760
the direction they got to move in. And you just wait for Apple, man. They are going to

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:15.760
bone the Mac desktop like nobody's business. You just wait till the iOS, that thing put

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:20.780
arm in it, in, in their machines. Everybody's going to need everybody who needs a truck

01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:26.440
is going to have to bail and good old Linux is going to be there with system D and Wayland

01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:33.760
and great video drivers and steam and hopefully a desktop that is usable. And I really think

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:40.380
that while these are today's problems, these might be solved in 2015, 2016 and beginning

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:46.340
to be solved in 2014. Are they already starting to be so exactly how I said that everything

01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:52.240
is going to be, you know, thin client remote that like remote processing of everything

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:59.220
and only thin clients will eventually do that and screw us. And that's what Chrome and OS

01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:02.320
is going to be. And that's what Android is going to be. That's their, that's their value

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:09.040
card. Yes. Yeah. I think everyone should have a little nasi in the corner. All cryptography's

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:15.760
math is correct. The implementations, sometimes buggy, but the math of crypto is correct.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:18.880
Don't worry about being tin foil hatty about it.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:24.200
So I leave us on that point. I mean, like, uh, we have some today problems with Android

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:29.940
that really bother me. Um, and, and I'm not actually sure that we've even scratched the

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:34.800
surface of this conversation around Google, Android, cloud services, monitoring and all

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:40.560
of that. But I think what we do see is solutions that are being created, right? We see solutions

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:44.700
in the PC industry that might actually end up being a lot of people's salvation. And

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:50.920
we might eventually with things like sailfish and fire Fox OS, I think we'll see solutions

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:55.560
there too. And you know, we'll just talk about them as they come up. But as of right now,

01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:00.320
I don't begrudge anybody for going out on Friday and buying themselves an iPhone. I

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:04.400
say good on you. I'll be happy with my HTC one. I'm going to stick with it for at least

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:08.000
now. I don't know. I could see you hanging out in a, hanging out in a car somewhere with

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.880
a hoodie and sunglasses and a baseball bat watching for folks at the Verizon store. Yeah,

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:17.600
yeah, yeah. I could see that too. All right. Mumble room. Well, thanks you guys for joining

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.320
us. Hey, uh, you guys in the download audience, if you want to join us live, you can, uh,

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:28.200
we do this on, uh, Tuesdays over at jblive.tv at, uh, 2 p.m. Pacific, which, uh, I believe

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:33.160
clocks in at like 9 p.m. UTC. If you want to join us over at jblive.tv or jblive.info,

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:36.560
we have a mumble server, which you can participate in, or we have an IRC chat room and, uh, we

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.320
watch that too. And then we also have a little, a pre and post show that, uh, is pretty great.

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.680
And don't forget to tune into this Sunday's Linux action show. We've got a big show coming

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:49.260
up. I am going to talk a little bit about, uh, there's a topic that's been coming up

01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:53.880
and up and up and over and over again is this building the personal cloud, right? Building

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:58.080
your own cloud on your land because that's really the most secure, but it's not just

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.320
about security. It's also about reliability, performance, and it's about being able to,

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:08.000
for example, my house could be a, my house is a big Netflix house, but Netflix doesn't

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.240
run so good on the Linux. So we've been moving that in the house. If there's a series of

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:14.680
the family likes rip it and I put it on the server for them. There's a lot of things you

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:19.040
can bring into the internal cloud, but how do you protect that home cloud? Well, one

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:23.640
of the oldest standing popular topics on Linux action show goes back to the very first couple

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.960
of episodes is firewalls. This Sunday, we're going to retackle that topic. Also bring back

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:31.880
some of the things we've talked about, cover Gabe's speech at the Linux con, Linux con

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.440
and a whole bunch of other stuff, Matt. So I think we're going to have ourselves a great

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:38.340
show. Oh, I'm excited about it. There's some great topics in there and you're fresh back

01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.880
from a little trip. That's awesome. And I had Saturday and Sunday off. That was, that

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:46.560
was actually quite nice. And you know, I was even able to play our pre show from Friday

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:50.600
on Sunday's live show. So people who showed up on Sunday still got to see a little bit

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:54.240
of that's awesome. Yeah, that was good for them. Yeah. All right, everyone. Don't forget,

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:57.720
you can contact the show. You can go over to Jupiter broadcasting.com pop that contact

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:02.120
link at the top of our show and choose unplugged from the dropdown box or even better start

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:07.960
a thread in our subreddit over at Linux action show.reddit.com. We check that out. All right,

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:12.520
Matt. Well, I'll see you on Sunday. I will see you on Sunday. Yeah, thanks. Thanks to

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.920
you, man. All right, everyone. Well, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.880
Linux Unplugged. See you right back here next Tuesday.
