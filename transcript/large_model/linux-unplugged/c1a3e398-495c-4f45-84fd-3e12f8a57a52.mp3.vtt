00:00.880 --> 00:07.400
Wester is a conspiracy afoot it appears that office 365 one drive looks at user agents to determine performance

00:07.400 --> 00:13.000
This is breaking news on the r slash Linux subreddit, which everyone knows is the Bastion

00:16.080 --> 00:21.100
CNN level style reporting here, but this is something to consider from tornado. He says a few weeks

00:21.120 --> 00:26.120
I've been running Linux mint 18.1. I got on my lappy. I'm still in school. I started a new project

00:26.120 --> 00:33.360
We have a project where we use one drive on an office 365 when he uses Firefox 52 and goes online

00:33.600 --> 00:38.880
He gets it in compatibility mode. Sadly enough. He said I experienced a lot of performance issues with that

00:38.880 --> 00:42.360
He says I have a desktop running Windows 10 in the same Firefox 52 web browser

00:42.360 --> 00:47.400
I tried working on the document and I see no I see if the problem is this but it does not there was no problem

00:47.400 --> 00:50.160
I began thinking about trying a few different things

00:50.160 --> 00:56.200
So he began switching the user agent under his mint install to make it look like he was running on Windows NT 6.1

00:56.880 --> 01:01.880
64-bit version of Windows but still Firefox gecko and after changing the user agent

01:01.880 --> 01:06.600
He says the performance problems were resolved the UI of one drive worked flawlessly

01:07.080 --> 01:11.760
The only thing the user the only thing that was changed was the user agent in the user agent was the OS

01:11.760 --> 01:14.020
He left all the version stuff of Firefox the same

01:14.020 --> 01:19.340
He thought maybe it was a random occurrence. So then he changed it back to the regular agent problem comes back

01:20.980 --> 01:25.820
Have we discovered a massive controversy here Wes or do you think it could just be a

01:26.380 --> 01:30.060
Testing thing like wow, we didn't test that one very well. So we'll put it in compatibility mode

01:30.060 --> 01:33.820
I am inclined to think that you should more often attribute things

01:34.940 --> 01:39.020
Two bugs rather than malice. Yes, I would imagine so in this case

01:39.020 --> 01:42.700
Yeah, especially in a case like this where I wouldn't expect Microsoft to do that

01:42.700 --> 01:48.460
I wouldn't expect Microsoft to put a ton of resources into researching and testing the Linux side of things

01:48.460 --> 01:53.500
So they dad just this should work, but we haven't tested it. So slap compatibility on there

01:53.500 --> 01:57.860
That doesn't pretty boss. All right, darn it conspiracy busted right here on the unplugged program

01:59.020 --> 02:01.020
This is Linux unplugged episode

02:01.780 --> 02:03.780
189 for March 21st

02:03.780 --> 02:15.780
2017

02:16.420 --> 02:24.060
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's alive and strong. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes

02:24.500 --> 02:30.140
Hello, sir. You know what Wes today is a great day. We have so many fun topics to cover

02:30.140 --> 02:34.940
Yeah for me personally, there's some great ones in here too. But I know for some of the other projects the shows just talked about

02:34.940 --> 02:37.620
in the past we got some great updates and then and

02:38.620 --> 02:40.300
Then I am I am really excited

02:40.300 --> 02:43.260
We have a we have a great attendance in the in the virtual lug today

02:43.380 --> 02:46.780
And I know one of the main topics we're gonna get into later in the show

02:46.780 --> 02:49.500
I don't want to say too much because I don't want them to yeah quiet now

02:49.500 --> 02:56.080
I don't want them to spoil it but we have we have a really great conversational topic about long-term future desktop like

02:56.700 --> 02:59.540
Stuff that's sort of an elephant in the room kind of stuff that we're going to be talking about

02:59.540 --> 03:04.620
We'll also get an update from I key on that what the solace project is up to some new code has been pushed and I got

03:04.620 --> 03:11.260
A few questions, but obviously obviously we're gonna start with a bunch of updates that are totally totally rockin

03:11.260 --> 03:14.220
So mr. West we've been supplied with are these are these a

03:14.980 --> 03:19.580
Are these an ale technically or are these consider a cider? It's a wheat ale. Oh, it's a wheat ale

03:19.580 --> 03:22.180
Okay, so wait us to help us to help

03:23.220 --> 03:25.220
grease the wheels of Linux unplugged

03:25.220 --> 03:30.100
West has supplied us with a passion fruit kicker. Oh, yeah a wheat ale with passion fruit built-in

03:30.100 --> 03:34.500
So that is that is that that'll be what we're drinking along here. Here you go. Cheers. Cheers

03:34.500 --> 03:40.500
Yes, cheers to 189. Yeah, and a Linux and to our mumble room. Oh speaking of that mumble room

03:40.500 --> 03:42.620
Let's bring them in time appropriate greetings a virtual lug

03:46.020 --> 03:48.020
Hello

03:48.100 --> 03:53.580
I am very excited a little bit of late-breaking news as we go into the show today

03:53.580 --> 03:57.820
Those of us that run Kodi are going to be very very excited by this news

03:58.660 --> 04:02.180
It looks like a proper Netflix plug-in could be coming to Kodi soon

04:02.180 --> 04:05.780
What in fact if you're on Kodi Android you can get your hands on it already

04:06.420 --> 04:08.420
so this is um

04:09.180 --> 04:10.380
This is not a sanctioned thing

04:10.380 --> 04:12.860
I'm gonna just get that big big caveat out of the way

04:12.860 --> 04:15.940
But after years and years a user of using different workarounds

04:16.180 --> 04:20.860
There is now sort of this legit Kodi native Netflix plug-in add-on being developed

04:20.860 --> 04:26.540
It's it's open-source. So that's kind of a big deal right there. Just this plug-in itself being open-source is nice

04:27.260 --> 04:29.260
Because it not only does it mean

04:29.420 --> 04:33.660
Maybe we could get off our Android Cody, but it could also do from architecture. Yeah, exactly

04:35.100 --> 04:39.820
So it's interesting because it's based on Cody's input stream binary add-on extension

04:39.980 --> 04:46.220
Which can serve as an input stream for Cody's video player, which is new since Cody 17, which has been a massive update

04:46.220 --> 04:50.700
The add-on it enables playback of the DRM protected content

04:51.260 --> 04:56.140
Without having to break the DRM distribution chain that Netflix uses to encrypt its video stream

04:56.940 --> 05:00.700
Now I think that's important because it means that Netflix might be content

05:01.020 --> 05:07.900
Pretending like this doesn't exist because you're not you're not doing anything improperly. You're not busting the DRM

05:09.020 --> 05:12.700
It only works with Kodi built for Android, but it should be possible to port it to Linux

05:12.700 --> 05:18.380
Right, like as long as it's not enabling workflows that break your user agreement or make it really easy to make it easy to pirate

05:18.380 --> 05:23.900
Yes, exactly. Then maybe they will just uh-huh. So this slide it is up on uh, it is up on uh,

05:24.860 --> 05:30.380
This is a messed up post. The Kodi 18 isn't anyways, it says a pre-rec is Kodi 18

05:30.380 --> 05:35.740
But the Ferronix post is the pre-rec is Kodi 17. I would guess it's 17 since 18 isn't

05:36.460 --> 05:38.460
A downloadable thing right now

05:38.460 --> 05:45.580
But uh for me using the NVIDIA shield android tv and having Kodi on there and it I right now

05:45.580 --> 05:50.860
I use Kodi to also play Plex media because I I yes, right I find um

05:51.180 --> 05:53.260
I find that every now and then when I back up something

05:53.260 --> 05:58.940
There's like a flaw in the file that I don't catch until I've tried to watch it and um the standard Plex player

05:59.740 --> 06:01.020
Just dies

06:01.020 --> 06:04.700
When oh, I hit it hits it, you know a couple of drop frames or drop audio files

06:04.700 --> 06:09.260
When oh, I hit it hits it, you know a couple of drop frames or drop audio package just dies

06:09.500 --> 06:11.500
Kodi will just and then keep going

06:11.820 --> 06:13.580
Go right. Um

06:13.580 --> 06:16.780
And it's faster too. And the plus you get all the other benefits of Kodi. You don't have to leave Kodi

06:16.940 --> 06:18.940
So now I can add one more thing to that

06:19.020 --> 06:21.340
exactly that that's where I would change things for me is I could go from

06:21.660 --> 06:25.980
You know before I have to rely on things like a chromecast or maybe it's built into a smart tv or I have a third

06:25.980 --> 06:29.260
Party device if it could all just be right in my Kodi appliance

06:29.260 --> 06:32.300
It really would make it more of an appliance to me because I do I mean or the people that

06:32.300 --> 06:35.020
Use it in my life and a lot of us use Netflix. Mm-hmm

06:35.020 --> 06:39.100
Yeah, otherwise you're always jumping out of Kodi to go watch exactly eventually now, uh, we have mr

06:39.100 --> 06:45.660
Colonel linux joining us this week and he he and I did like this, uh, accidental versus like cheap android tv box versus

06:46.220 --> 06:48.220
The nvidia shield which is kind of on the higher end

06:48.700 --> 06:53.500
I've since bought two more nvidia shields since that review. I really like the product, but I wanted to check in with you

06:53.500 --> 06:55.420
Colonel linux. Are you still using uh?

06:55.420 --> 07:00.300
Are you still using that android tv reviewed ages ago or if you all have you rolled all back to the western digital lives?

07:00.300 --> 07:04.540
Nope, so I have uh still in the house the majority of the um

07:05.020 --> 07:09.260
Of the media players are still the western digital tv lives the box you're talking about is the matricom

07:09.660 --> 07:12.780
uh m a t r i c it's like 99 bucks, right

07:13.100 --> 07:18.460
Yeah, it's a little cheaper than that and I have the I have the q2 which comes with the the built-in ir

07:19.420 --> 07:24.940
Connector as well as wired ethernet. Um, and so far i've had not I have not had any problems

07:24.940 --> 07:30.700
I'm still using that the the q2 downstairs in my shop where so basically every day when i'm working on something

07:30.940 --> 07:33.100
I just have it kind of up playing some media

07:33.580 --> 07:36.860
Um, and I really really like it. They're only I only have two hits

07:36.860 --> 07:41.420
I found once I tried to take it with me to the lake and the western digitals are all 12 volt dc

07:41.420 --> 07:46.700
So you you know living in an rv you can understand why that's amazing and the the q2 is is five volts

07:47.100 --> 07:51.660
So I have to use a either an ac inverter. I'd have to use like a voltage step down transformer

07:51.660 --> 07:58.460
Transformer, um, and then uh, the other thing I don't like about it is there's no there's no the western digitals are very square

07:58.540 --> 08:03.180
So they mount very nicely to the wall and the the g2 is or the q2 is kind of a i'm surprised

08:03.180 --> 08:06.700
How many boxes do that? Yeah, that's weird, right? That is uh, that is a thing

08:06.780 --> 08:11.740
They do they they do make they make a bracket for uh, the roku and I was I was planning on using that

08:11.740 --> 08:15.820
But you know the fact that you have android means that it works with netflix means it works with cody

08:15.820 --> 08:22.640
Yes means, you know and and the ability to to be that flexible is actually worth overcoming some of the other shortcomings

08:22.780 --> 08:26.060
That's how that's that's exactly been my takeaway. I key. I saw you in there saying

08:28.060 --> 08:31.580
Can you explain a little bit of that I mean I saw a lot of that it seemed like you were going

08:33.100 --> 08:39.340
Using a player I just use my web browser like a man explain yourself. Oh, yeah. I mean that's pretty much it

08:40.940 --> 08:43.660
I like that I do this massive characterization. Yeah, that's about right

08:43.660 --> 08:48.380
Yeah, I have youtube and I have netflix in the browser. I mean what else do I need?

08:48.460 --> 08:50.460
Well, I think I don't have downloads

08:50.780 --> 08:52.940
I think for I think for me and you know

08:52.940 --> 08:57.660
I think one of the reasons I talk about cody more is when I when I moved into lady jubes

08:57.660 --> 09:03.340
I made this huge shift into consuming a lot of my video content via the television instead of on my my desktop

09:03.420 --> 09:07.340
Yeah, and it's a totally different experience for me. Like it is a legit way

09:07.820 --> 09:11.740
For my my fiance and I to sit down right, especially when you're sharing it with yeah

09:11.740 --> 09:15.740
And the family too like it is it has become like our primary way of we don't have television

09:15.820 --> 09:20.620
We barely get any where i'm at right now. I get decent reception, but usually I don't hardly have any reception

09:21.180 --> 09:26.860
Um, so for me, it's I I yeah, obviously if i'm at my desk i'm using chrome. Yeah, i'm not using cody

09:26.940 --> 09:30.220
I'm using chrome, but if i'm on the if i'm on my tv

09:30.940 --> 09:32.780
I want something that is

09:32.780 --> 09:37.020
Appliance level reliable and fast and cody's the only one that delivers that and it has you know

09:37.020 --> 09:42.060
Like it integrates well if you want to tie in like an ir remote or other things that will be feel first class

09:42.140 --> 09:47.260
In the tv. Yeah system. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean right now I have it all tied in with the echo, which is right

09:47.340 --> 09:51.500
Yeah, there you go. Yeah something don't don't tell noah, but I just walk in I tell it to turn on the tv

09:51.580 --> 09:53.180
And it just does all that stuff

09:53.180 --> 09:57.180
Um, all right. Well, let's move on because I know not everybody cares about cody and just next one

09:57.180 --> 09:59.900
I just wanted to take a moment. There's two pieces of kind of

10:00.620 --> 10:02.300
I don't know if malware is the right term

10:02.300 --> 10:04.860
It's not because the first one's ransomware and the other one's an exploit

10:04.860 --> 10:10.780
But I just thought both these stories were interesting. Uh, and so I wanted to throw them together really quick first. I love this

10:11.340 --> 10:14.540
Um, there's new ransomware out written in python and it's called

10:15.100 --> 10:17.840
Kirk ransomware. Yeah, it's kirk ransomware

10:18.540 --> 10:23.580
Um, and it's the first ransomware really that uses the are you familiar with this mono monero?

10:24.140 --> 10:27.980
Monero, uh payments. It's like an alternative. It's an alternative to bitcoin

10:29.340 --> 10:34.300
What kind of big crap what oh, yeah, okay. It's an open source cryptocurrency created in april 2014

10:34.300 --> 10:36.380
Yeah, I don't know why i've never heard of it. No, I haven't heard it about either

10:36.460 --> 10:37.740
Yeah, but i'm sure

10:37.740 --> 10:41.580
But you know what? I i'm gonna read on but I have I have a little bit of bacon about this

10:41.660 --> 10:43.660
I I kind of I kind of suspect something

10:44.540 --> 10:47.580
Yeah, so it is uh, it's written in python

10:47.580 --> 10:53.180
So it seems like it could probably be moved over to linux and you know screw up your home directory if you're not careful

10:53.740 --> 10:56.620
Um, but there was one little bit of tidbit that I liked about it

10:57.260 --> 11:01.020
It is not knowing how it's being distributed. So don't worry. This is not like a this is not something

11:01.020 --> 11:03.500
That's like a big deal. I just some of the details are interesting. Um

11:03.500 --> 11:11.120
Um, it masquerades as a network stress testing tool called low orbital ion cannon, which we've heard of before. Absolutely

11:11.900 --> 11:15.100
So what happens is people go out and they look for like I want to do a network stress test

11:15.820 --> 11:20.220
Or I want to just be a dick to somebody and they go get low orbital ion cannon thinking that well

11:20.220 --> 11:23.580
This is the python script that does it turns out no actually it encrypts your home directory

11:24.620 --> 11:25.500
um

11:25.500 --> 11:30.140
The kirk ransomware will then generate an aes password that will require the user to

11:30.140 --> 11:36.060
Put in um the unlock key to decrypt the files, but this is the best part. This is the best part of all of it

11:37.820 --> 11:39.420
The decrypter tool

11:39.420 --> 11:43.580
Do you have a guess what it's called? It's called kirk ransomware. What do you suppose the decrypter tool is called?

11:44.940 --> 11:49.980
Really hoping for something with con or spock one of those two. It's spock. The decrypter is called spock. Yeah

11:50.060 --> 11:54.540
Yeah, you run the spock decrypter and they supply that to the victim once the payment's made

11:55.180 --> 11:58.780
Nice, and I mean the live long and prosper thing after yeah, that's nice. That's nice

11:58.780 --> 12:03.740
They got a screenshot of that. I really some production quality like, you know, they wanted the appearance to be nice here

12:04.460 --> 12:06.460
It's me. It's it's

12:06.780 --> 12:11.740
It's I think a promotion for the cryptocurrency. Yeah, I think somebody created this what?

12:12.860 --> 12:14.940
Like why not con like yeah

12:15.100 --> 12:20.140
Well, I guess spock is saving the day right because con would be destroying your files and spock is rescuing

12:20.140 --> 12:20.220
Yeah

12:20.220 --> 12:24.300
So if it didn't if it like fake decrypted and just deleted them then it would be con

12:24.460 --> 12:26.620
I really feel like this is a promotion for a cryptocurrency

12:26.620 --> 12:31.100
Like hey, how do we get some movement in the market? You know what we do? We get people to have to go buy some

12:31.340 --> 12:35.260
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, not only does to get the name out there, but about six moneros

12:35.900 --> 12:38.220
That's not true, but i'm mining moneros right now, dude

12:39.820 --> 12:45.980
Now kirk will ruin your plans. So maybe we should like create a fix for this

12:46.920 --> 12:50.860
Ransomware that will maybe that will be called con the fix for the man's rent

12:50.860 --> 12:55.020
Right, right. I think I think or the ransomware should have been called the wrath of con

12:55.020 --> 12:56.140
um

12:56.140 --> 13:00.300
All right, then just one other thing just to follow from a story. We covered recently that cia vault 7

13:00.780 --> 13:02.780
well, it turns out now that with some of the

13:03.260 --> 13:04.060
I

13:04.060 --> 13:08.540
It's funny because wikileaks has been getting a hard time for releasing code that that makes us more vulnerable

13:08.620 --> 13:13.580
But I wish they would have released more code so we could have built better tools to detect where cia tools are being used

13:13.900 --> 13:18.860
But there have been some people uh sabana virus companies that have taken some of the wikileaks releases

13:19.260 --> 13:23.420
And generated pattern recognition to detect the tools and stuff like that. So there is some stuff that's coming out

13:23.420 --> 13:25.020
um

13:25.020 --> 13:28.140
And there's this one a simple command allows the cia to commandeer

13:29.080 --> 13:31.340
318 different models of cisco switches

13:32.060 --> 13:34.060
The bug relies on a telnet protocol

13:34.860 --> 13:36.700
Yeah relies on the telnet protocol

13:36.700 --> 13:41.500
um, and uh, yeah over three three hundred and eighteen switches. All right, what's the command?

13:42.300 --> 13:47.660
Yeah, right. Um, I don't know because all they say is the bug resides in the cisco cluster management protocol

13:48.060 --> 13:51.660
Which uses the telnet protocol to deliver signals and commands on the internal network

13:51.660 --> 13:56.220
So I don't I don't ours is not really giving you the command here in the article

13:56.860 --> 13:59.100
Uh, I just thought I thought you know

13:59.260 --> 14:04.380
Just wanted to follow up on the vault 7 stuff and also include it maybe with the with the star trek malware

14:04.540 --> 14:07.980
Or i'm, sorry ransomware. Oh, that's beautiful. Yeah, or horrible. Yeah

14:08.460 --> 14:13.900
now william, I see you're you're back in the room and your your timing couldn't be more perfect because there is

14:14.540 --> 14:19.100
One big update on a project that you've gotten me really excited about and that is bcash fs

14:19.100 --> 14:23.020
I think a new version has shipped and lots of stuff's been going on

14:23.020 --> 14:28.780
I think the biggest milestone has been that all of the breaking on disk format changes are landing like all that stuff's getting out of

14:28.780 --> 14:31.180
The way that should be over now in theory

14:31.820 --> 14:34.300
But there's also some other big features that have rolled out

14:34.540 --> 14:37.260
Where do you where should we start when we're talking about the new bcash fs?

14:38.060 --> 14:41.580
I think the most interesting thing is the on disk encryption stuff that we're doing. Yes

14:41.660 --> 14:45.180
The cache fs that's great because you build that right into the file system

14:45.180 --> 14:50.300
And so now you'll have competition in that space and I think what's even better is that not only do you get encryption?

14:50.300 --> 14:52.140
But you also get verification

14:52.140 --> 14:57.180
So that someone can't just come along and write bytes to the underlying file system and corrupt your data without you knowing about it

14:57.420 --> 15:02.460
Because with something like dm crypt you just get encryption. It doesn't actually check to see if what you wrote is authentic

15:02.940 --> 15:04.940
Okay, I hadn't even thought of that

15:05.100 --> 15:10.220
Uh, and then also, uh, can you tell me about the wonders of the new backup super blocks?

15:10.220 --> 15:13.340
I mean that just brings it up in the line with the butter of fs and zfsd, right?

15:13.340 --> 15:16.140
So you get a bunch of super blocks distributed across the file system

15:16.380 --> 15:19.500
That way in case one of them gets corrupted you still have backups to go back to

15:19.740 --> 15:23.100
Because before I think on the version that i'm using on my laptop you just have one super block

15:23.340 --> 15:25.900
So the moment that one thing gets corrupted you lose everything

15:26.540 --> 15:29.100
So is this uh, is this new in node format?

15:29.100 --> 15:32.300
Is this one of the larger sort of practical changes in the new in the new release?

15:32.300 --> 15:37.580
It's not necessarily interesting to end users, but it is a little bit more compact and it does allow him to um,

15:37.580 --> 15:40.700
Add more features to the file system over time. So I think it's actually a good thing

15:40.700 --> 15:44.700
Oh, and also I like this line being able to fit all of your metadata in ram smiley face

15:45.260 --> 15:49.340
Yes, that is that is very a lot of them are just small underlying changes that make it more performant

15:49.900 --> 15:53.260
User space fsdk. That seems kind of nice. Yeah, that just is yeah

15:53.260 --> 15:59.980
Actually having the fsdk already done before it's even integrated into linux is probably a huge selling point because neither zfs or butter

15:59.980 --> 16:03.740
Fs had that. How do you feel about the file system migration stuff?

16:03.740 --> 16:06.140
So apparently it works flawlessly i've never tested it

16:06.140 --> 16:09.420
I actually am not using the new version yet. I'm still on the old disk format

16:09.420 --> 16:14.300
I mean like somebody wants to bail on butter fs because it's garbage or somebody wants to upgrade from extended four

16:14.620 --> 16:17.500
Or somebody wants to purge zfs from their life. Hello

16:17.580 --> 16:19.580
Fantastic because it'll take any file system

16:19.660 --> 16:24.060
It'll build an image and then you can rewrite that image over once you verify the image is correct

16:24.140 --> 16:26.460
Obviously, this means that you're going to store the data twice

16:27.020 --> 16:30.140
So you're using less than 50 of your file system currently. Yeah, that's right

16:30.140 --> 16:34.460
But it is nice if you have a fairly small amount of data and you want to migrate your root fs over or something

16:34.460 --> 16:42.700
And you could you could also oh, yeah. Okay. So, um, could you could you actually boot from from a bcash fs file system?

16:43.420 --> 16:45.900
Yeah, i'm booting my laptop, but i'm running the whole thing on the

16:45.900 --> 16:51.100
Oh, I thought that wasn't a thing partition the efi partition has to be readable by the efi. Okay, so it's fat 32

16:51.180 --> 16:53.180
Yeah, um, but otherwise it's all bcash

16:53.660 --> 16:56.460
Uh, it's built right into the kernel. Unfortunately, that doesn't work

16:56.460 --> 17:01.580
You have to build his linux tree, right? Uh, I maintain my own with the most stable patch set

17:01.580 --> 17:05.100
He actually just keeps it at like the base 49 and just keeps adding patches on top

17:05.420 --> 17:08.540
But I merge in the stable versions every now and then as soon as they come out

17:08.940 --> 17:13.340
So i've just been keeping with that. It's a fairly up-to-date kernel. Like it's still 49. It's not 410 or you know

17:13.340 --> 17:18.380
The rc but he pushes it forward every now and then so kent's assertion here is that uh,

17:18.700 --> 17:21.900
Raid one and raid 10 are raid one and raid 10

17:21.900 --> 17:28.060
Potentially work. It's not very well tested as my understanding and i'm not 100 sure the recovery code is even in place

17:28.620 --> 17:31.500
And then so it'll distribute the blocks across multiple disks. Uh-huh

17:31.980 --> 17:36.860
Uh, but beyond that i'm not really sure how well you'd be able to recover your data stuff went bad

17:36.940 --> 17:40.700
I know it is doing checksumming. So it is aware of disk errors

17:41.020 --> 17:44.220
I'm, just not sure what the replication code does in the case of seeing an error on one

17:44.460 --> 17:47.900
Disc if it copies the crank over from the other disk, right? Yeah, but it's not

17:47.900 --> 17:53.260
An error on one disk if it copies the crank over from the other graph, right? Yeah, what is the tooling like around the?

17:54.200 --> 17:58.780
Replication support like I you know, i'm familiar with like zfs send obviously is that is it in line?

17:58.940 --> 18:04.700
Well, that's different right? Okay, that's sending and receiving uh file system images more or less or compression

18:04.940 --> 18:10.700
Okay, this is different than this. This is the raid levels. This would be like, you know running mirrored mode in cfs

18:13.740 --> 18:16.140
I think eventually he's going to grow send receive support

18:16.140 --> 18:20.700
I just don't think that's a major feature major milestone on his plate right now, right?

18:21.260 --> 18:25.580
Man, this is sounding like an awesome freaking this is sounding like my future linux file system right here

18:25.820 --> 18:26.220
Yeah

18:26.220 --> 18:30.060
It'll be really interesting to watch as it uh gets closer to being ready to be upstreamed

18:30.220 --> 18:33.580
I think someone said deduplication in the chat room. No, there's no deduplication yet

18:34.780 --> 18:37.900
I assume that will also be something that's pretty trivially possible at some point

18:38.140 --> 18:42.060
I think the hardest thing is going to be getting snapshot support. Oh, yeah. Why is that?

18:42.060 --> 18:49.100
Oh, just given the structure of the file system using b-trees. It's fairly hard to do snapshots correctly

18:49.740 --> 18:53.820
Oh, okay. I think at butterfs. It's actually fairly complicated logic

18:53.900 --> 18:59.260
I was gonna because that was gonna be my next question is it seems like that was something that butterfs sort of rolled out with is

19:00.220 --> 19:02.220
Is this?

19:02.220 --> 19:10.380
Is this not a format sorry, is it not a copy-on-write file system? It's a copy-on-write file system then didn't

19:10.940 --> 19:16.780
Normally, well copy the attitude do it is yeah copy you copy it and then just stop

19:18.300 --> 19:22.940
Sorry, you just stop writing where it was writing you write somewhere else sort of

19:24.460 --> 19:29.340
I know that's a gross oversimplification. That's a gross oversimplification and I don't think those are the underlying issues

19:29.340 --> 19:32.380
Okay with doing snapshotting. Well, hmm

19:33.180 --> 19:36.220
You know what? I I would love to know more about that. Maybe yeah

19:37.100 --> 19:41.100
The hardest part i'm not necessarily very familiar with the topic, but I think the hardest part is actually

19:41.500 --> 19:48.460
Purging old snapshot data. Oh interesting keeping ref counts correctly and those sorts of things and then rebalancing the b-tree. Hmm

19:49.580 --> 19:53.180
This is uh, this is this is this is a project we've been watching now for I don't know

19:53.260 --> 19:56.380
I mean feels like it's been it's been a little while now. Uh, it's been going

19:56.380 --> 20:00.860
Yeah, he announced it. I think in august or june and you've been that time frame somewhere in the summer

20:01.020 --> 20:03.020
You've been running it for how long?

20:03.260 --> 20:05.260
I've been running it since he announced it basically

20:05.820 --> 20:11.660
And I haven't reformatted once love it dude. I will say there's probably a bit of corrupted stuff on there. Oh, just a little

20:13.020 --> 20:18.780
Wow, it seems to be running. Okay still I think one of the nicest things is the tail the long tail latency is fairly low

20:19.180 --> 20:25.100
So all your operations perform incredibly quickly when you're just trying to do small accesses. Oh, man, that's nice

20:25.100 --> 20:31.100
Yeah, random performance is very good. Assuming that the underlying device is also decent right like a modern ssd or something

20:31.260 --> 20:33.260
Yeah, which is what you want

20:33.980 --> 20:37.820
Yeah, because the problem with butter fs i've noticed is you get a lot of hangs doing certain operations

20:38.060 --> 20:41.260
Every now and then like it'll just go to sleep for a second and come back. Yeah

20:41.500 --> 20:44.300
Um, especially this is better with that especially under different

20:44.620 --> 20:48.620
There's some conditions where that seems to be worse too with butter fs. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it seems

20:49.100 --> 20:51.820
It's not a well understood thing. It's a very complex code base

20:51.820 --> 20:55.100
So maybe if I grab edge cases where you can run into really long tails

20:55.340 --> 20:59.260
And bcash does as much as it can to not run into those long tails for reason rights

20:59.340 --> 21:02.700
I see so it tries to avoid doing most of the work in the critical path

21:03.500 --> 21:08.380
So if I get this kernel and the synchronous path, maybe if I compile that wire guard module, too

21:08.460 --> 21:13.180
I can just be the ultimate kernel hipster. So you're just going to switch to gen 2 got my wire guard

21:13.260 --> 21:14.460
Nice

21:14.460 --> 21:16.460
Living in the in the future you do

21:16.540 --> 21:20.460
Like william's like yeah, that's my setup. What disk are you using william? I'm using xms

21:20.460 --> 21:23.660
Oh, yeah, that's right. That's why you're one of my favorites

21:24.620 --> 21:28.780
We got to do an episode on that. Yes, we do. We can do an episode. I can show you nixos in production

21:30.220 --> 21:34.620
Awesome. Yeah, write that down. I think I think I think I want to do that. Let's talk to know about it

21:34.700 --> 21:36.940
We'll figure it out. Okay. Yeah, cool. All right

21:36.940 --> 21:40.140
Well, uh, let's uh, let's talk about solace here in just a moment

21:40.140 --> 21:43.900
But first first I would like to say a big thank you to linux academy

21:44.300 --> 21:49.820
I I am so I am so happy with the growth linux academy has seen and and the pickup there again

21:49.820 --> 21:51.820
And the partnerships they're establishing now

21:51.900 --> 21:57.660
it's one of those things where if you signed up like a year ago like every single week something new and

21:58.620 --> 22:00.620
Just constantly improving

22:00.620 --> 22:02.620
It is so so valuable

22:02.700 --> 22:05.680
Uh, but if you're new to it, I would I would encourage you to get started at linuxacademy.com

22:06.780 --> 22:12.300
Unplugged you get a seven-day free trial that is going to get you acquainted with like the essentials of this platform

22:12.380 --> 22:17.980
It's it's a platform to learn about linux. It's a platform to advance your career and go into a new field

22:17.980 --> 22:21.340
It's a it's a platform to double down on the area that you work in

22:21.820 --> 22:22.860
It is

22:22.860 --> 22:28.780
So well built because it was designed by linux enthusiasts linux educators and developers who came together and said, all right

22:29.580 --> 22:31.580
How can we advance linux?

22:31.820 --> 22:37.020
And I had this conversation with their ceo before they were even a sponsor when we just started flirting about

22:37.660 --> 22:41.820
It's okay. What are you feeling it out feeling it out? Just no, that's that's that's that's a whole different

22:41.900 --> 22:47.100
Hold on. Hold on to a different picture. We were we were just kind of talking just talking at first and uh,

22:47.100 --> 22:50.940
He said, you know where we watched jb, uh, but I don't understand how you make any money at it

22:50.940 --> 22:52.460
I said, well, we don't make very much. It's like yeah

22:52.460 --> 22:52.620
well

22:52.620 --> 22:57.660
We think we might have a way to advocate linux make money and actually improve the workforce in a way that it was like

22:57.900 --> 23:01.820
A tool that was never available when you were in the workforce like oh, yeah, sure anthony. Yeah, that'll happen

23:02.300 --> 23:05.900
And you know what a couple of years later now it is unbelievable what they've accomplished

23:06.280 --> 23:11.900
Self-paced in-depth video courses on every linux cloud and devops topic and they're not afraid to branch out into areas that you need

23:12.700 --> 23:13.660
it's

23:13.660 --> 23:20.220
Very impressive hands-on scenario-based labs give you experience on real servers instructor mentoring. That means an actual human being

23:21.180 --> 23:24.220
That knows what they're talking about an instructor that will work with you and you need help

23:24.220 --> 23:28.300
That's that's phenomenal for the type of course where they're covering. This is unique to the linux academy

23:28.460 --> 23:32.300
They have lab servers that spin up on demand as you need them a course scheduler for your busy schedule

23:32.620 --> 23:34.560
I would like you to go check them out at linuxacademy.com

23:35.500 --> 23:39.420
Unplugged that supports the show and from there you can sign up for a free seven-day trial

23:39.420 --> 23:43.340
well, the other thing that's nice is even when life gets busy like

23:44.620 --> 23:46.940
Say it's the holidays right and life is super busy

23:47.260 --> 23:51.340
They have nuggets that can be just a few minutes long where you can just go in and get a little value that week

23:51.580 --> 23:54.700
They have availability planners that can build courseware for your busy schedule

23:55.420 --> 23:57.100
And on top of all of that

23:57.100 --> 23:59.900
You can just log in and just get snapshots of what your progress is out

23:59.900 --> 24:03.660
So you can kind of just keep track of how you're doing you get time estimations for every major topic

24:03.660 --> 24:06.060
You want to learn python? You want to learn ruby? You want to learn php?

24:06.060 --> 24:11.100
It's going to take you six hours four hours seven hours. It's like quantifiable. Yep. It's great

24:11.340 --> 24:14.620
Like you I know I I don't know how to wrap my head around learning ruby

24:14.700 --> 24:18.860
I know how to wrap my head around six hours where you have to go find all the documents then do it

24:19.020 --> 24:20.620
Oh, this is all just right there

24:20.620 --> 24:20.780
Right

24:20.780 --> 24:24.780
Have an idea of how long it's going to take and for me taking it down from i'm going to learn this

24:24.920 --> 24:31.340
Nebulous topic that is is massively broad and there's so many different opinions taking it from something like that to

24:31.340 --> 24:36.140
I'm going to spend six hours and learn a thing is so much more mode

24:36.140 --> 24:41.900
It's like I have so much more motivation to do that because it's a clearly definable object to that same point

24:42.540 --> 24:46.780
You can just browse through right? Like maybe I want to learn ruby by looking you can see all the stuff

24:46.780 --> 24:50.060
You'll do after going through their resources. You'll have an idea like okay. Yes

24:50.060 --> 24:53.760
I'll be able to accomplish my goal after six hours. Absolutely linuxacademy.com

24:54.460 --> 24:56.700
Unplugged go there to keep us going support the show

24:56.700 --> 24:59.660
Let them know you heard about it here and then sign up for a free seven-day trial

24:59.660 --> 25:06.460
And by the way, the community rocks because it's stacked full of jupiter broadcasting members. They fork like the study cards and stuff

25:06.540 --> 25:08.540
So that way they get even better over time

25:08.620 --> 25:14.620
It's nice and they've got downloadable guides you can take with you and lessen audio personal notebooks tools that help you study

25:15.100 --> 25:17.840
Ios and android apps as well linuxacademy.com

25:20.060 --> 25:22.400
Thanks linux academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

25:23.100 --> 25:28.780
So mr. Aiki joins us again, which is it's always a it's always a nice pleasure. So thanks for being here ike

25:28.780 --> 25:33.180
I appreciate it because I know it's not like the middle of it's not like the afternoon over there like it is here

25:33.180 --> 25:37.180
So I always really do appreciate it's about nine o'clock. Well 20 to 10 now

25:37.580 --> 25:41.420
I I I don't i'm grokking from what's happened that you probably don't sleep much anyways

25:41.500 --> 25:45.020
Because it looks like a lot's been going on with solace. It got uh mate matea

25:45.560 --> 25:49.980
1.18. I got new linux kernel coming in got a new budget coming in. Tell me what's going on over there

25:50.860 --> 25:52.860
Uh, yeah, basically all that stuff

25:54.220 --> 25:56.220
And lots of new apps too or updates

25:56.220 --> 26:02.540
Yeah, I mean matea 1.18 went in I think it was the day after or maybe even two days after i'm not even sure now

26:02.940 --> 26:06.060
Uh, we got that into solace got that tested very quickly and out to people

26:06.620 --> 26:13.180
No breakages was very very happy with that. Congrats. Uh, we got the lib input support as well. So that's very nice. That's great

26:13.740 --> 26:17.740
Oh, yeah, so now people will have less touchpad problems. Really that's super nice

26:18.460 --> 26:22.860
Yeah, so there's been bugs about that on the tracker long standing issues, but upstream solved them

26:22.860 --> 26:28.060
So we have those in one of our changes from solace that actually landed for this release cycle

26:28.620 --> 26:32.860
Was the action icon support within mate notification daemon. Oh nice

26:33.500 --> 26:38.460
It's a trivial little change, but it just allows you to have icons instead of just plain text on there

26:38.620 --> 26:43.900
Yeah, and some applications like rhythm box express more actions when icons are available

26:44.220 --> 26:48.140
So it's uh, it's a more natural use of things like media players

26:48.140 --> 26:52.540
So we was happy to get something in at least into that release

26:53.100 --> 26:57.820
And we got four point nine point sixteen kernel, I believe we're on now

26:58.220 --> 27:04.860
Uh, we're following the lts tree for now until we got a clear boot manager integrated and then we can have switchable kernels

27:05.100 --> 27:06.620
How is that going?

27:06.620 --> 27:08.140
That's actually gone really well

27:08.140 --> 27:15.580
So the last bit of stuff that I was doing there was basically implementing proper name spacing on the efi system partition

27:15.580 --> 27:20.220
Uh, so the decision was made to namespace under the efi directory

27:20.700 --> 27:27.500
So for solace it would be slash efi slash com dot solace project and then all of our files will live in there

27:27.900 --> 27:34.620
And we're going to want to add things like uh, firmer update support in there using the fw upd project

27:35.500 --> 27:36.860
and i've

27:36.860 --> 27:40.540
Pretty much finished the grub 2 support for legacy booting

27:40.540 --> 27:45.420
So I need to test that on the laptop, but once that's done, it's pretty much close to a 2.0

27:45.820 --> 27:50.940
And then that will be deployed first as a suicide test. So remind me, uh, yeah

27:50.940 --> 27:56.060
I mean, I mean it seems like you're going to be uh aside from clear linux won't you be?

27:56.860 --> 28:00.940
Won't won't you be the only other distro that's shipping? Uh, that is the bootloader

28:01.900 --> 28:08.380
Yes, well, it's not the bootloader itself. The idea is explain it to me because I barely understand so explain it to me. Yeah, so

28:08.380 --> 28:09.740
so

28:09.740 --> 28:11.740
basically want to have a

28:12.140 --> 28:17.100
Safe and bulletproof approach to booting and the management of kernels themselves, right?

28:17.420 --> 28:20.620
We've broken it down a few weeks ago, and I thought it was actually a pretty brilliant idea

28:21.180 --> 28:23.180
Uh, it's it's an intel project, right?

28:23.820 --> 28:29.260
Yeah, so basically bootloader tools you can kind of trust them. Not always

28:29.900 --> 28:35.820
When it comes to things like case sensitivity it matters to linux. It doesn't matter to fat 32

28:35.820 --> 28:41.980
So simple things like that if you was to go and rename some of your directories to some cranky mixed case names

28:42.460 --> 28:46.140
And then if you started to use things like a gummy boot or boot control

28:46.620 --> 28:52.780
You're going to run into problems where you can no longer install or update because it's trying to create new name directories that already exist

28:53.100 --> 28:55.660
So it started out of those problems and having

28:56.380 --> 29:01.740
Having a way of updating to a new kernel and retaining the last kernel without having to have

29:01.740 --> 29:08.140
Lots of meta packages depending on new versions of those packages to push the updates because you don't want to end up where you've got

29:08.460 --> 29:12.140
47 different kernels on your system and no way to garbage collect them

29:12.460 --> 29:17.340
So I had to implement a policy whereby it knows if a kernel is booted, which is very simple

29:17.340 --> 29:20.140
That's just a system d job to run the tool, right?

29:20.460 --> 29:25.500
It then needs to know what the new default kernel is. It needs to know about different types of kernels

29:25.900 --> 29:28.220
And when to kill an old kernel

29:28.220 --> 29:35.740
So basically everything lives in user lib kernel and once once you call the tool everything happens in a single atomic

29:35.740 --> 29:41.260
Atomic operation if you can't continue it's going to bail and it will try its absolute best

29:41.660 --> 29:46.780
Not to murder your system. This is really an attempt to get as close as possible to bulletproof kernel updates, right?

29:46.780 --> 29:51.820
Yeah, that's the thing. So sometimes I mean we've all been there. You've updated kernel you boot to the new kernel

29:51.820 --> 29:58.380
You boot to the new kernel at crap, you know, it's completely trashed now if you're using solace or even arts linux

29:58.380 --> 30:00.780
You know yourself the way the kernel updates work

30:01.420 --> 30:03.420
Your last kernel is gone

30:03.420 --> 30:07.900
It's just completely gone now. You're on the new kernel. You've had the carpet ripped out from underneath your feet

30:08.540 --> 30:11.020
And all the kernel modules are gone. You've got a reboot

30:11.340 --> 30:14.220
So it's all those things now distributions like ubuntu

30:14.220 --> 30:17.900
They use meta packages to depend on the new package they put out, right?

30:17.900 --> 30:21.980
Right, but then you still have all those old packages. You still have the complexity of it

30:22.300 --> 30:28.060
You still have poor maintenance of the esp itself where you have something like slash vm linux

30:29.580 --> 30:31.580
How do you jewel boot with that?

30:31.900 --> 30:33.660
It's it's just not really good

30:33.660 --> 30:39.260
I mean we've jewel booted for years with legacy boot purely because we all maintain our own separate boot trees

30:39.660 --> 30:41.660
Um, we get away with that, right?

30:41.740 --> 30:46.220
When you start having a boot partition you start to get conflicts when you've got an esp

30:46.220 --> 30:50.540
You're almost certainly screwed. So, you know, you need to be able to jewel boot

30:50.540 --> 30:55.180
You need to be able to have bulletproof updates and always always always do the right thing

30:55.580 --> 30:58.300
So if something does go wrong, you can just boot back to the old kernel

31:00.140 --> 31:05.420
That's going to be a great way to make sure you know feeling comfortable with updates especially kernel updates

31:05.580 --> 31:09.740
Yeah, I mean imagine look at the just look at the hoops that mint goes through to avoid kernel updates

31:10.140 --> 31:14.220
I would much rather just know that I could boot right back into my last configuration if I need to

31:14.220 --> 31:19.500
And yeah, I mean that's kind of the main thing now the problem you have like, um, if you use system deep boot

31:19.580 --> 31:21.660
You know, it's basically the same as gummy boot, right?

31:21.740 --> 31:28.700
Yeah, and solus a long time ago forked gummy boot when we had the whole fiasco of system d. Oh really swallowing

31:29.340 --> 31:30.620
uh gummy boot

31:30.620 --> 31:35.580
And my reasons there was the whole distro side of it not the actual boot side of it

31:35.740 --> 31:39.660
It was things like the case sensitivity because it's actually a case of case ignorance

31:39.660 --> 31:45.580
Because linux cares fat does not care, but if you try and create two files uppercase and lowercase

31:45.980 --> 31:47.580
Linux is going to scream

31:47.580 --> 31:53.260
But fat again doesn't care it would just fail to create the file because it already exists linux doesn't know it exists

31:53.580 --> 31:59.980
So because of problems like this and basically upstream system d didn't care at the time or being able to upgrade from

32:00.460 --> 32:04.380
Gummy boot 49. I think it was to the first system debut again

32:04.380 --> 32:08.300
They didn't want to implement that logic and I wasn't particularly happy

32:08.300 --> 32:15.900
So that's why my fork came about but the stuff that went into that that that approach to the esp and the maintenance of it

32:16.700 --> 32:19.660
That's what clear boot manager now does anyway

32:19.660 --> 32:19.980
Yeah

32:19.980 --> 32:23.260
So I can now drop a fork I can adopt system debut

32:23.740 --> 32:27.340
And I can have cbm manage all these things the nicer bits that it does

32:27.820 --> 32:32.060
Is it automatically generates and maintains the loader entries on the esp?

32:32.620 --> 32:36.620
So you probably seem like the loader entries star.com files that you have

32:36.620 --> 32:41.980
What cbm does is it will emerge the upstream command line files, which is on a per kernel basis

32:42.460 --> 32:46.780
So we could have like linux and linux lts. We have a default command line in those

32:46.780 --> 32:51.180
Yeah, you can have etc command line files as well, which are then merged into it

32:51.180 --> 32:56.140
It will dynamically find the root partition and put the root equals part into there as well

32:56.140 --> 33:00.300
So you don't have to go looking for block id stuff anymore. Yes. I hate that

33:00.300 --> 33:03.900
You know the pain with that and one of the nicest things it actually does

33:03.900 --> 33:08.540
At the moment, it's limited to draco, but it can actually find out if you're running an encrypted root fs

33:08.540 --> 33:11.420
And put in the lux uuid in there for you

33:12.300 --> 33:17.660
Which i've had problems with that with grub and if you're manually creating entries with something like system debut

33:17.980 --> 33:20.860
It's very very hard to get all those things consistent

33:21.500 --> 33:25.820
So it does all of this stuff for you create entries just so you're safe all the time

33:26.700 --> 33:29.180
Pop up bless you see kernel linux when I say

33:29.180 --> 33:33.820
I feel like solace is a is a different distribution. Even if it might be a smaller distribution

33:33.820 --> 33:38.140
I you know, I think it's something you can't know as a regular end user

33:38.380 --> 33:42.700
Maybe you can tell by certain external properties of a project, but there's no way to really know

33:43.580 --> 33:49.420
Unless you listen to these shows I suppose like the heads behind these projects like ike that's you're obviously

33:49.420 --> 33:55.260
Solving you're solving a problem there with with clear root manager that red hat's trying to solve the canonical is trying to solve

33:55.260 --> 34:01.740
and This seems to be a very very very obvious way to do it after you explain it's like that makes sense

34:01.740 --> 34:02.940
That's of course, that's how we should do it

34:02.940 --> 34:06.620
Like this seems like and I really like the the using of prior art

34:06.620 --> 34:10.460
Maybe that isn't well known but seen, you know seeing that diamond in the rough. I'm like this

34:10.460 --> 34:14.300
This is something that everyone can benefit from that. Yeah, that takes a lot. Yeah

34:14.300 --> 34:18.300
I mean a lot of my projects now have been trying to focus on making them distro agnostic

34:18.300 --> 34:22.540
So while clear bit manager obviously started out with clear linux to a large extent

34:22.540 --> 34:29.740
So you don't have this benefit anymore of you know, having these um, these meta packages and these new dependencies been introduced

34:30.060 --> 34:33.900
You don't have that. You have a static file system contents. There's atomically written to this

34:33.900 --> 34:35.580
This is what you have to work with

34:35.580 --> 34:40.140
So the idea was to turn the update mechanism into the delivery mechanism

34:40.700 --> 34:43.980
So you'll have like these user lib code that you can use to do that

34:43.980 --> 34:47.820
And then you'll have a bunch of other things that you can do that you can do that you can do that

34:47.820 --> 34:54.140
Update mechanism into the delivery mechanism. So you'll have like these user lib kernel files that turn up

34:54.540 --> 35:00.140
The only thing that really changes there is the sim link. So you'd have like default lts or default kvm

35:00.620 --> 35:02.780
Those point to the newest kernel. So there's no

35:03.420 --> 35:06.860
There's none of this trying to figure out by the release number or the version

35:07.260 --> 35:11.020
Which is the newest thing because I did that in the past. It doesn't work very well

35:11.580 --> 35:14.620
So it looks at the sim link what whatever's the newest one is the default one

35:14.620 --> 35:18.140
Which should be your basically your head or your tip kernel. Hmm

35:18.780 --> 35:22.140
And it took a while to get that right. But once it started getting fleshed out

35:22.140 --> 35:25.580
It's like this clearly could be used in other places damn

35:25.740 --> 35:30.620
So I set about making that agnostic and i've been trying to do that with a lot of my projects. Yeah, you have I agree

35:30.780 --> 35:33.660
I you know, and I don't I don't agree. Everybody always takes it up

35:34.140 --> 35:40.780
Sometimes somebody else somebody else just creates the same idea and uh, but it's a start to try to have less of that

35:40.860 --> 35:43.180
now you think arch would actually uh would be

35:43.180 --> 35:47.580
Would it be open to something like this because I I mean arch is the perfect candidate

35:47.580 --> 35:51.340
I agree. They've got a very similar process to the way that solace does it?

35:51.900 --> 35:53.900
You know like you you have this kernel package

35:54.300 --> 35:59.660
And then you have this danger of you're removing a live kernel and live modules from the system

35:59.820 --> 36:04.540
Yeah, and that's just incredibly dangerous and it's got to lead it's got to be the number module breakage

36:04.620 --> 36:07.980
It's got to be got to be the number one rolling cause rolling break

36:08.060 --> 36:11.900
Yeah, I mean my usb no longer works because these modules are buggered off, right?

36:11.900 --> 36:15.820
I can no longer use my speakers or you have all these problems

36:15.820 --> 36:19.900
But yeah, something like this would be very easy for them and it's a very fixed scheme

36:20.460 --> 36:23.340
so you'd have like a user lib kernel and then you'd have like a

36:23.740 --> 36:29.340
Kernel dash com dot solace project blah blah blah each one has a a namespace I configure time

36:29.660 --> 36:35.660
So you customize it for your distro the the branding stuff that's put into the loader files

36:36.060 --> 36:39.420
That's just taken from the os release file. So it's all standardized stuff

36:39.420 --> 36:44.540
Uh, one of my rules when i'm creating anything and you'll see this even in solace or any other projects I do

36:45.100 --> 36:47.740
Not a lot of what I do is original or new

36:48.380 --> 36:51.500
It's just doing something in a sensible way

36:52.060 --> 36:57.580
I'm, not necessarily inventing anything new because again, this is using the existing technology. It's just trying to

36:58.140 --> 37:00.140
Trying to make it sane

37:00.220 --> 37:04.780
Basically, hmm, you know, I feel like uh, well, I guess I'll ask you this question

37:04.780 --> 37:09.500
Do you think the success of the clear boot manager might be dependent on the success of clear linux?

37:10.780 --> 37:13.740
Um, do you think it stands on its own because to me it feels like it stands on its own

37:15.900 --> 37:17.020
Well, I mean it's not one

37:17.020 --> 37:23.180
I mean i'm not going to talk about the success or whatever of clear linux because obviously i'm not in capacity to do that

37:23.260 --> 37:24.300
Right

37:24.300 --> 37:30.220
But clear bit manager itself while it started out as just a solution for clearing is something that quit very quickly

37:30.540 --> 37:32.540
Became obvious. It had to be agnostic

37:32.540 --> 37:37.020
And you know, that's something that's maintained in my own namespace up on github

37:37.740 --> 37:39.180
quite deliberately

37:39.180 --> 37:42.140
and at some stage, I probably will change the name as well because

37:42.860 --> 37:47.260
It was at the time. It was like, okay. What's a generic descriptive name? All right clear bit manager

37:47.820 --> 37:53.180
Yeah, I actually I really like it. I think it's actually I think it I think it's very good

37:53.260 --> 37:57.580
I we're going to get it adopted very very soon in solar. So over the next week

37:57.660 --> 38:00.860
I mean i'm on vacation at the moment, but i'm going to be finishing this up over the next

38:00.860 --> 38:05.820
Six weeks along with the other solace bits, you know how vacations work. You just go mad at projects

38:06.620 --> 38:09.020
So i'll get that finished up tested once that's in

38:09.580 --> 38:13.820
We can just throw that straight into solace and then immediately everyone is then on

38:14.700 --> 38:18.060
I mean, it's it's been an issue like for over a year in solace

38:18.540 --> 38:22.860
People like I update and then my windows entries are gone because what actually happens there

38:23.420 --> 38:26.140
Is your ntfs and f80 modules have disappeared?

38:26.140 --> 38:31.260
And because it's the first time it's trying to load them using os prober. It tries to mount the file systems

38:31.340 --> 38:35.420
It can't do them because the modules are gone. So you lose windows from grub

38:36.060 --> 38:41.900
And those are the sort of usability problems we've had or i've stuck in my headphones. They're no longer working yet

38:41.900 --> 38:47.020
Sorry, you're gonna have to reboot, you know, the whole thing sounds it sounds like it sounds like a really great solution

38:47.020 --> 38:49.580
and I can't wait for solace to ship it because

38:50.220 --> 38:53.820
That's it's an example of something that solace is willing to do that

38:53.820 --> 38:58.300
I just don't think ubuntu is going to do right now or fedora is going to do right now

38:58.860 --> 39:02.380
Um, I maybe I could tell but I think once solace proves it

39:02.380 --> 39:03.980
I think I could see them doing it

39:03.980 --> 39:09.420
But I the reason why I mentioned that is because it takes me back to the conversation that noah and I had

39:10.620 --> 39:14.620
months ago where he felt like he was kind of writing off solace because

39:15.100 --> 39:21.820
It was some sort of boutique. It was esoteric in a sense and my my point was is it might be slightly boutique at the moment

39:21.820 --> 39:28.140
But it is it is in that position where it's it's you guys are the right size and have the right temperament to

39:28.700 --> 39:35.340
Implement sweeping changes like this that people that are playing it a little bit safer are not willing to make and the issue is

39:36.140 --> 39:39.260
If you're always living in the little bit safer zone of linux

39:39.500 --> 39:41.660
You kind of miss out on some of the best stuff that's being

39:42.220 --> 39:46.620
That's happening and you kind of something you kind of miss out on some of the new solutions to solve the problems like

39:46.940 --> 39:49.340
This is gonna this could potentially one day

39:49.340 --> 39:55.820
Legitimately lead to bulletproof kernel updates on arch and solace and other distributions. That's a big deal

39:55.900 --> 39:58.860
That's a really big deal. And if you're hanging out on ubuntu

40:00.060 --> 40:00.700
And it's fine

40:00.700 --> 40:06.300
But you're gonna miss it until it until it trickles down years down the road and that's totally fine and legitimate for a lot of

40:06.300 --> 40:08.060
People but for some of us

40:08.060 --> 40:13.180
You want that now if you're not riding that solace wave or you're not on the arch system or you're not want to insert distro

40:13.180 --> 40:18.220
X right, whatever you're gonna miss it and I and I think you guys are in a really great position to do that

40:18.220 --> 40:21.020
You guys are in a really great position because you've got a good size user base

40:21.020 --> 40:23.980
So it matters these things matter and you have to be careful

40:24.380 --> 40:26.540
You have to contemplate very carefully about this

40:26.860 --> 40:29.500
But you're also not at the size where it's so so large

40:29.900 --> 40:33.820
That 200 people lose their job if everything falls apart. And so I mean that's the thing

40:33.900 --> 40:35.900
we we don't have to play it safe and

40:36.460 --> 40:41.740
One of the things that we have that the other projects done and it's not me blowing smoke up my own arse here, right?

40:42.060 --> 40:45.420
We're one of the very very few independent projects that

40:46.220 --> 40:47.820
is not

40:47.820 --> 40:50.620
Commercial viability is not an aspect in any decision

40:51.340 --> 40:54.380
And that's something that we have that none of the other independent projects have

40:54.780 --> 40:59.500
Because even though they might be independent and they might be you know, they might be 501c or whatever

41:00.220 --> 41:02.460
They still have interests to consider

41:03.020 --> 41:06.060
Whereas we are fully independent. We can go make changes

41:06.620 --> 41:13.020
And there isn't a board to satisfy there are no shareholders there to get again frightened by the changes

41:13.020 --> 41:17.980
And so we can go in and make the changes that nobody else is willing or able to make

41:18.700 --> 41:20.140
And then you know

41:20.140 --> 41:22.140
They can say that we've done it. Well, it's all right

41:22.220 --> 41:27.660
And then it might change their thinking as well and that's one of the things that's it goes back to again

41:27.660 --> 41:32.700
Like, you know, how do you measure success if we get people to rethink how they've been doing these things?

41:33.260 --> 41:36.700
You know, we're the disruptor at the moment when it comes to linux

41:36.700 --> 41:44.140
We've chosen desktop linux and we're going to disrupt and make people reconsider the way things have been going on for the last 10

41:44.220 --> 41:45.900
20 years whatever

41:45.900 --> 41:48.620
So if we can only just do that then we've already succeeded

41:49.100 --> 41:52.860
I like I like that how you phrase that especially given how much we talk about fedora

41:53.180 --> 41:58.380
As playing kind of a similar role of pushing the edge, but from a very you know red hat comes, you know

41:58.380 --> 42:01.100
It's a very traditional enterprise perspective

42:01.420 --> 42:05.980
Uh, so I like that that solace can come from a very different place and innovate in the same. That's a super good point

42:05.980 --> 42:09.980
No, were you were you about to jump in there? Yeah, i'm just gonna say so I think I think saying I wrote

42:10.140 --> 42:12.560
Um solace off might be a slight mischaracterization

42:14.460 --> 42:16.940
So I I think I think that um

42:17.740 --> 42:21.740
I think that really what I was trying to get at was that it's great to have

42:22.140 --> 42:25.020
Uh people that are idealists like ike and I think it's great to have

42:25.260 --> 42:29.680
Projects that have to stop you there because i'm not an idealist. I'm very pragmatic

42:29.680 --> 42:35.280
If you're pragmatic though, why why exclude java java is you know, java is a very needed thing

42:35.440 --> 42:37.680
And there are a lot of apple. It would nobody likes java

42:37.680 --> 42:41.520
I don't like java, but the reality is I need java to do half of the things I do during the day

42:43.280 --> 42:45.280
Uh, well the last time that we tried to use it

42:45.840 --> 42:50.240
The last time we tried to use solace. Yeah, java was not working properly and simple help didn't work properly. Oh

42:50.800 --> 42:56.240
Simple, right. I remember. I mean, well anyway, but just electron app and it's not even java. No, it's not electron

42:56.240 --> 42:59.840
Here's the thing we can go on. I mean there there I I can pick it apart piece by piece, right?

42:59.840 --> 43:01.920
We can I could go out and say there's a you know

43:01.920 --> 43:05.760
Like we could go back to the minicom thing. I need to be able to use, you know serial communication

43:05.760 --> 43:11.200
But that my overall point is that you're making you make decisions with the project that say

43:11.760 --> 43:16.640
We're not going to do x because I have a belief system of y and that's a good thing

43:16.880 --> 43:22.400
And I think you should be commended for it. I don't think I don't think you can necessarily say that um,

43:22.400 --> 43:29.520
That that we're on the same level playing field as somebody like a bantu who says here are the requirements of xyz users

43:29.520 --> 43:30.880
Here's what they want to be able to do

43:30.880 --> 43:36.320
Let's accommodate that and make what compromises we need to make to make that distribution useful to those people. Sure

43:36.320 --> 43:37.120
Yeah, all right

43:37.120 --> 43:41.520
But what am I doing then if i'm not making compromises for users and addressing real world needs?

43:42.080 --> 43:48.720
To look at and reevaluate problems that have existed for a very long time and lex and i'm already looking at how our

43:48.720 --> 43:53.600
Distribution, would you characterize it? I'm saying they're doing it wrong. Yeah, I am saying that they're doing it wrong

43:53.760 --> 43:57.280
How do I add software to your distribution without compiling it from source?

43:58.000 --> 44:02.640
Install it from the repos if we don't have it request it flat pack will be the future method

44:03.280 --> 44:04.480
Okay

44:04.480 --> 44:07.360
What if they're okay? Well, right? What how do I do it right now?

44:08.960 --> 44:12.560
If it's not in the repos and I don't want to compile it from source, but I just want to install the software

44:12.560 --> 44:15.680
How do I get it then request it? Okay, you have to install it from source

44:15.680 --> 44:19.360
I just want to install the software. How do I get it then request it? Okay, you have a book tracker

44:19.600 --> 44:23.840
And in fact, we redid the requirements after that last how should we say?

44:24.640 --> 44:26.640
mild fiasco

44:27.600 --> 44:32.480
We've redid the requirements because I basically said the same as everyone else the requirements were complete bullshit

44:32.560 --> 44:34.160
We know they were bullshit, right?

44:34.160 --> 44:37.680
But we hadn't had a discussion about it until that point they've been read

44:38.160 --> 44:42.640
But you still have a gatekeeper you still have ultimately you still have a person that decides this can be right

44:42.640 --> 44:48.400
But that's no different to debian or abuntu. You still have to request a package that's not there. That's not entirely true

44:50.560 --> 44:55.200
Right, but somebody else has had to package it. How is it different from solace when somebody has to package it?

44:55.520 --> 44:57.520
Could I not package it myself on abuntu?

44:58.480 --> 44:59.840
Yes, but

44:59.840 --> 45:02.240
I can't do that around in a circle from what you've just said

45:02.480 --> 45:06.400
You said if it's not on solace and you know, I I would then have to package it

45:06.400 --> 45:10.240
That's a bad thing on solace, but you're then allowed to package it on a bun too

45:10.240 --> 45:13.360
What i'm saying what i'm saying is it what i'm saying is

45:13.920 --> 45:18.800
That as an if I was a software you could make your own you could make your own custom

45:19.600 --> 45:22.480
I could make my own ppa. I could just make a dead file

45:25.280 --> 45:30.320
If you want ppa support and solace ask me and i'll set it up i'm not an augur off in the distance

45:32.880 --> 45:37.920
If there is demand for it, I will happily do these things there has to be an actual demand

45:37.920 --> 45:44.000
But I guess my my my my I guess my overall point is the fact that we're having this discussion now

45:44.560 --> 45:48.240
Rather like you didn't you didn't see that people would want to add

45:48.400 --> 45:54.000
A software and if you didn't have your own method you wouldn't have included ppa that that's something that

45:54.320 --> 45:58.000
After we've already had the discussion of it being a boutique or not boutique distribution

45:58.080 --> 46:01.680
Now we're having the discussion of how we're going to maybe include ppas

46:02.560 --> 46:06.400
And so if we go back to the core problem here, it's about software availability, right?

46:06.400 --> 46:11.200
The thing is if you want something like ppas, you also need people willing to maintain those ppas

46:11.760 --> 46:13.760
You know, you can't just say

46:14.800 --> 46:19.040
Because i'm wasting money i'm pissing money in the wind if I do that, right? It doesn't help anyone

46:19.360 --> 46:24.640
We've got to a point now where we have people coming through and I think so far we had something like 15,000 patches

46:24.960 --> 46:30.480
With multiple revisions come through to solace from the community. We're at a point now where our tooling is in place

46:30.480 --> 46:37.840
Where we're switching our infrastructure over. There's actually an open bug for this to allow community maintainers for packages within solace

46:38.240 --> 46:40.560
So that that in itself isn't really a problem

46:40.880 --> 46:45.680
There has to be people willing to package those things our packaging is very very very simple

46:45.920 --> 46:48.880
I made our policies very very simple for those to do that now

46:49.120 --> 46:54.160
Yes, the software isn't completely there at the moment, but then again, we're not exactly an old project

46:54.480 --> 46:57.760
So there are going to always be things that you want and aren't there yet

46:57.760 --> 47:03.680
If you want them ask us someone's going to put it in it might even be us now because people from the community are doing it

47:03.920 --> 47:05.920
It takes time to build things up

47:06.160 --> 47:10.160
But it takes even longer to build them up properly and that's what we've been doing

47:10.400 --> 47:13.760
So you say that you're so would you say your position has changed from the last time?

47:13.760 --> 47:21.600
We had a conversation where you said that part of your part of your part of your methodology was to exclude software that you didn't think was

47:22.060 --> 47:24.060
appropriate or well maintained

47:24.060 --> 47:29.820
I've been more lax on it. Yes, right because first of all, we had a policy that's basically come through

47:30.540 --> 47:36.380
From the evolve os days and you have certain protective policies in place because at the time, you know your capabilities

47:36.380 --> 47:41.820
You know your size and you know your your technology at the time our tooling very much sucked

47:42.140 --> 47:45.420
And we didn't even have white package or soul build back then

47:45.900 --> 47:52.860
So there are certain things we basically said absolutely no way in hell are going in because it's going to cause us grief down the road

47:52.860 --> 47:57.020
We've now got to a point where white package soul built all of these tools exist

47:57.340 --> 48:02.620
And it's very very very trivial for anyone to just sit there and package something. It's a yaml file

48:02.860 --> 48:08.220
You know, we've got a troop builder. You don't need to install a ton of dependencies on the system. It's very very easy

48:08.460 --> 48:13.340
So it's allowed me to be more lax on them. Did I take too long in doing the policy?

48:13.720 --> 48:19.340
Probably but the the conversation wasn't properly had we saw how it went someone went and bitched on reddit

48:19.340 --> 48:23.500
That's that's not how you do things. You know people normally know i'm very upfront, you know

48:23.500 --> 48:27.100
I'll be very blunt about things but go and whingeing behind me back on reddit

48:27.100 --> 48:29.100
It's not going to do anyone any favors

48:29.100 --> 48:34.300
Raise it up with me and we'll fix it. I would respectfully i'd respectfully disagree with the characterization there as well

48:34.460 --> 48:36.460
You know, it's one thing to you know

48:36.620 --> 48:42.540
To me complaining on reddit is simply going to reddit before taking any other action and right but I hadn't seen it

48:42.540 --> 48:45.820
This is this is the point if it didn't go to me, how was I going to know here?

48:45.820 --> 48:50.300
But so where on the solace site does it tell me that I need to direct solace project.com?

48:50.300 --> 48:51.980
There's a tracker link in the bottom

48:51.980 --> 48:56.780
But my point is that he attempted to go through what you know based on based on his

48:57.100 --> 49:00.940
Based on the time constraints that he had he went through to try to submit an issue to you guys

49:01.180 --> 49:04.060
He got formal communication back from the solace project

49:04.060 --> 49:06.060
Maybe maybe you had or had not seen it

49:06.140 --> 49:08.140
But how is he supposed to know that you know?

49:08.460 --> 49:10.620
What i'm saying is like if I submit something to canonical

49:10.700 --> 49:12.780
I don't wait for mark to come back and say

49:12.780 --> 49:17.340
Hey, you know i'd say did mark personally review this when I submit something to system 76. I don't make sure that well

49:18.700 --> 49:21.020
You're making a very unfair comparison there, right?

49:21.580 --> 49:27.100
We are not the size of canonical. We do not have 700 employees fine fine compare it to altus

49:27.340 --> 49:32.140
I have five. I have five the lead developer personally review every single issue that comes through our company

49:32.300 --> 49:37.740
I delegate out to other people and I would expect that a customer wouldn't expect me to review every single issue as well

49:37.740 --> 49:43.820
So I think that I think that I think that just because that you didn't personally see it to then and then after he took

49:43.980 --> 49:50.060
Steps to submit it to you and then was rejected and after that process completed then went on reddit and said here was my experience

49:50.060 --> 49:53.820
I think to characterize that as complaining, you know, that might be a bit unfair to him

49:54.860 --> 50:01.340
Right, but what i'm saying, right long story short is could have complained then say look let's look at the policy

50:01.660 --> 50:05.980
Nobody then said let's look at the policy and i've said we took too long in fixing the policy

50:05.980 --> 50:09.660
But we did put a policy in place. It wasn't the right way to go around it

50:10.060 --> 50:14.060
And that's all it comes down to I I suppose and that's a matter of opinion at the same time

50:14.140 --> 50:18.700
I also don't think it's necessarily appropriate to expect your users to uh

50:19.020 --> 50:24.380
To suggest policy revisions to to the project because you know like to for to a large example

50:24.940 --> 50:31.580
As a user if a software company or software project doesn't meet my needs or isn't willing to work with me at some point

50:31.580 --> 50:36.140
I just say okay. That's the direction they want to go. I'll go a different direction. That's fine. Hmm

50:37.660 --> 50:39.660
All right, look everyone's entitled to their own opinion

50:40.700 --> 50:47.420
But we are talking about someone who did provide a patch right and that incur that it does infer not just a user

50:47.660 --> 50:51.580
Right. So let's get that one out of the way. That is a contributor and a developer

50:51.900 --> 50:55.180
Yes, they had a bad experience, but that was the policy at the time

50:55.260 --> 50:58.300
Yeah, and at the time the policy said no this thing can't go in well

50:58.300 --> 51:03.740
Which was fair because the policy that then said this thing is basically dead. It's abandoned, right?

51:04.620 --> 51:06.780
Then we did revise the policy afterwards. Yes

51:06.780 --> 51:11.500
It wasn't exactly a great experience the way it turned out and I don't think anyone wanted to turn out that way

51:12.140 --> 51:16.860
Me and that particular guy spoke and read it afterwards and we said we said it didn't really need to go this way

51:16.940 --> 51:20.780
Right and and I followed that conversation one minor correction to chat room is reminding me

51:20.860 --> 51:25.020
It wasn't uh, it wasn't simple, uh note that I had problems with it was simple help

51:25.020 --> 51:31.100
Uh, and which which heavily relies on java just one minor correction. So yeah, we've only got open jdk at the moment

51:31.180 --> 51:34.860
I guess we do like the oracle jdk. So I just want to might be part of it

51:34.860 --> 51:39.020
I just want to step in here for a second and just say, you know when I uh, when I think about this

51:40.220 --> 51:43.740
uh, I think what I what I what I do take away is, uh

51:45.660 --> 51:52.380
Almost every time he comes on the show he's evolved in a way that's logical and and understandable on a position

51:52.380 --> 51:57.580
Uh, like you know, he just sprinkles and you know things like flat pack bombs and things like that in his conversation generally

51:57.580 --> 52:03.500
But that's a huge that is a huge change from where you started originally on this show and I

52:04.140 --> 52:06.140
as someone who also um

52:06.860 --> 52:12.060
Tries to allow myself to change my mind on things and just you know get get into something and then decide to change it

52:13.020 --> 52:18.540
Because I feel like if I don't evolve my position that i'm not taking in new information. I'm not taking in new input

52:18.540 --> 52:24.220
I'm not considering all of my possibilities if I just stay really fast and on a particular course

52:24.620 --> 52:25.820
so I

52:25.820 --> 52:29.100
I guess I I I look at this and I think we'll we'll

52:29.660 --> 52:34.060
Screw all of this crap. Let's move forward and just get flat packs. Like if this i'm i'm sick

52:34.140 --> 52:36.140
I am so sick of this conversation

52:36.460 --> 52:40.300
Let's get flat packs up in here and you know what i'll install the three programs

52:40.380 --> 52:42.380
I need that aren't in the repo at this point

52:42.540 --> 52:47.180
Maybe two at this point that aren't in the repo from flat packs. I'm good. I'm good

52:47.180 --> 52:50.780
But it comes down to a simple thing. It's it's

52:51.500 --> 52:55.020
The solo started off very very very very tiny. It was basically just me

52:55.580 --> 53:00.220
Originally making something for myself. It grew a lot quicker than I expected

53:00.700 --> 53:03.420
You know, it's it's had problems. It's had growing pains

53:04.140 --> 53:08.220
And every so often, you know, we go through this new expansion right now

53:08.380 --> 53:12.700
We're right on the edge of one and you always know when it's coming because you can feel the tension

53:12.700 --> 53:17.260
We have this kind of debates as well. God, do I know what you mean? They do happen, right?

53:17.500 --> 53:22.780
And at the moment we're on the verge of expanding again. It's like an exponential growth. We do it every few months, right?

53:23.420 --> 53:28.220
And the the problem we have right now and it's it's basically a meme solace has no software, right?

53:28.700 --> 53:30.620
And yes, it's valid

53:30.620 --> 53:35.420
But the thing is we're willing to look at ourselves and say right this thing isn't being done, right?

53:35.420 --> 53:41.260
We could do it better. So in terms of maintenance load and core software availability

53:41.260 --> 53:46.480
We're basically moving all of our infrastructure into fabricator, which is the dev.solaceproject.com

53:47.020 --> 53:52.940
What that'll allow us to do is allow people within the community to own a git repo within solace

53:52.940 --> 53:57.980
Which corresponds directly to a package. They'll be able to publish it directly to the unstable repo

53:57.980 --> 53:59.980
Obviously we'll have checks and stuff. Don't worry about that

54:00.300 --> 54:04.860
But for the core repo, we're going to go from just a few gatekeepers and that kind of is the problem here

54:04.860 --> 54:07.500
Isn't it? It's gatekeepers, which is what noah said, right?

54:07.500 --> 54:11.980
We'll go from just having a few select few to a basically this tick list

54:12.460 --> 54:18.380
Of what is okay to go in and we've even got a two distro role if it's in two mainstream distros, you know

54:18.380 --> 54:20.380
It goes in

54:20.380 --> 54:25.900
Interesting for sure. Yeah, because it was it was it was so anal but it protected us during growth

54:26.540 --> 54:30.620
So then we'll have this checklist. It's there's a few things that it basically says, you know

54:30.620 --> 54:33.580
Like if it's introducing huge stack complexity

54:33.580 --> 54:35.580
Whoever said getting this half the fun never

54:35.580 --> 54:42.700
Whoa, whoa kaira. Sorry over eager kaira was very excited about you

54:43.340 --> 54:45.340
Huge stack that was really scary

54:45.820 --> 54:49.180
That was one of the scariest things ever happened on this show actually

54:49.340 --> 54:55.180
Yeah, if it introduces like really large complexity, um, like something like plasma then someone would have to maintain it because yeah

54:55.340 --> 55:00.540
Okay, we can't do it ourselves. That's very logical outside of the core applications. We're we're gonna back flat pack

55:00.860 --> 55:02.540
We're gonna help get them hosted, you know

55:02.540 --> 55:07.580
Like and we've done the the gl validation for the the open gl driver support nvidia and stuff

55:07.900 --> 55:10.700
So there will be choice. It's not all completely there now

55:11.100 --> 55:13.180
But if you look at it the the last year or so

55:13.180 --> 55:19.660
We've been building that engine that core part of solus and defining what solus actually is, right?

55:20.220 --> 55:22.380
Now it's the time when we say let's flesh it out

55:22.860 --> 55:28.220
Let's legitimize ourselves as a distro and that's where we're at now. So we've been a project we've

55:28.220 --> 55:32.060
Focused on the os aspect for it for a very long time

55:32.860 --> 55:37.900
And now it's about legitimizing ourselves as a distro as a larger player within the scene

55:38.220 --> 55:40.300
And yeah, we're going to want the community to help us do that

55:40.780 --> 55:43.900
You know, it's like kaira says getting there is half the fun and we're watching

55:44.860 --> 55:48.940
Just like people are watching last go through a a transition, uh, you know

55:48.940 --> 55:52.780
we watch solus in some sense go through a transition and uh, I

55:52.780 --> 55:58.140
I don't know. I so I find that all to be I find I find everything from from flat packs to clear boot manager

55:58.220 --> 56:01.980
To the latest mate all to be extremely interesting development. So thank you for coming on

56:02.780 --> 56:05.340
I'll say one last thing before I go now

56:06.060 --> 56:10.780
A lot of things I say are a lot of things I say about solace. I'm not saying in a blanket statement way

56:11.180 --> 56:13.180
solace is for

56:13.260 --> 56:17.100
Some people it's not for everyone. It's the same as for budgie. It's for some people

56:17.420 --> 56:21.420
It's not for everyone when i've complained about things like valor before it's

56:21.420 --> 56:24.460
It's good for certain jobs. It's not good for everything, right?

56:25.340 --> 56:27.340
Use the right tool for the job

56:27.660 --> 56:33.680
We need to stop being so religious and trying to blanket apply these things to every given situation

56:34.140 --> 56:36.780
Solace is not trying to dominate every market

56:37.100 --> 56:40.140
It is trying to go for the home and give users a good experience

56:40.540 --> 56:45.020
That does not mean we're going on satellites and we're going on servers or raspberry pies

56:45.020 --> 56:47.980
We've a given focus if it doesn't work for you. That's great

56:47.980 --> 56:53.820
We work on projects that go on over distributions to work with us on those things. Hmm. I like that boy

56:53.820 --> 56:55.900
That's a great philosophy. I got one question for you

56:56.460 --> 56:58.460
Uh bungee 11. What am I getting it?

56:58.700 --> 57:04.940
Bungee 11. What's this shit? I know budgie. What is it? Should be right, right? Yeah, we're doing 10.3 first

57:05.580 --> 57:07.580
Because we have some issues with

57:08.700 --> 57:11.340
I don't want it. Yeah, it's old. It's crusty. It's

57:13.180 --> 57:15.900
It's well refined it works good. It's stable well

57:15.900 --> 57:20.140
Apart from all who wants those don't even get started on the alt. Okay. Okay

57:20.380 --> 57:26.620
So budgie 11 we're looking to have that basically in next quarter and we're we're right on there to going into next quarter now

57:27.260 --> 57:32.220
And we will be one in testing on that and i'm gonna i'm gonna try and see if we can do some kind of

57:32.600 --> 57:35.580
Unstable testing images so you can just download them and give them a go

57:36.620 --> 57:38.860
Don't know how that's going to be working yet

57:39.500 --> 57:44.700
But yeah, I mean that'd be kind of cool if you can just get like unstable builds of budgie and try it out

57:44.700 --> 57:49.900
Yeah, I think that'll be and maybe submit a few times. It's gonna be a few months. Yeah, very good. Very good

57:50.220 --> 57:53.100
Yeah, all right kind of stay tuned. Well, thank you very much, sir

57:53.100 --> 57:56.940
Thank you for taking the time and like kairos is getting there is half the journey and half the fun

57:57.020 --> 58:01.100
I know that i'm coming i'm gonna go but texas you're about to find out you know what dylan my son

58:02.140 --> 58:07.660
That my my drive down to texas lands right on the spring break. Yeah, so he's gonna he's gonna go with us

58:07.660 --> 58:10.140
He'll be there the whole trip. It's gonna be a ton of fun

58:10.140 --> 58:14.860
Uh, and you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna use my ting my fi i'll have a cdma and gsm

58:14.860 --> 58:20.940
My fi go to linux.ting.com to sign up you get a twenty five dollar dollar discount if you sign up or

58:21.500 --> 58:23.500
If you're bringing advice

58:23.580 --> 58:27.100
They give you twenty five dollars in service credit now your average ting bill twenty three dollars

58:28.860 --> 58:32.060
Can you believe that I heard an ad for a network the other day

58:32.860 --> 58:36.800
It was just 23 or no actually it was 22. It was just 22

58:36.800 --> 58:40.640
22 for the entire line that's before your usage

58:40.800 --> 58:48.240
That's before that 22 just to add in a line a line 22 ting is six dollars

58:50.320 --> 58:52.880
Gsm and cdma six dollars

58:54.080 --> 58:59.920
22 just for the line, you know, it's six dollars and you pay for what you use minutes messages megabytes

59:00.000 --> 59:02.160
You add them up whatever you use. That's what you pay

59:02.160 --> 59:07.440
It's really easy to keep track of too because they got apps for your mobile device and they have a totally killer website

59:07.600 --> 59:12.320
They also have really good customer service if you need to talk to a human being and get some actual support from a geek

59:13.280 --> 59:15.840
Ting's ting's got that they have cdma and gsm

59:15.840 --> 59:18.320
So you can either bring a device or pick whatever works best for you

59:18.560 --> 59:24.400
I'm mentioning that because that's huge for me right now because most of my trip i'll be on gsm

59:24.400 --> 59:31.120
But there will definitely absolutely without question be times where I need a cdma network and that's what's so great about ting

59:31.120 --> 59:34.640
I got the tools to keep control. I can turn them off when i'm done. That's something else

59:34.720 --> 59:38.240
I think that is maybe overlooked because there's no contract. There's no really termination fee

59:38.240 --> 59:40.400
You can turn the line on for two months and turn it off

59:41.520 --> 59:46.320
I got this little tracker that I was i've been thinking about putting in the rig again so people can track the trip

59:47.520 --> 59:49.680
Well, I i'm like I use that once a year

59:50.640 --> 59:54.400
Am I seriously gonna go get a contract or i'm sorry. It's not a an agreement

59:54.720 --> 59:58.660
Am I gonna for for something to use once a year? No, that's ridiculous

59:58.660 --> 01:00:03.140
I'll put it on the cdma network. I'll pay it for one month and then i'm done

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:10.420
I can use these devices like the tools they are linux.ting.com go there check them out

01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:12.980
And you know what since we had a little random kyra

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:16.340
Let's go get an app pick from kyra because they otherwise that's just like we got

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:21.620
Hanging kyras, so we got to get this in here. Whoever said getting there is half the fun never flew economy

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:24.500
Oh, i'm kyra and this is the ting app of the week take the rv kyra

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.500
Tripcase

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:32.260
Tripcase aims to take the trouble out of travel. If they don't already have a slogan

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.100
They're welcome to use that one

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:38.340
The first time you try tripcase, it might blow your mind when you get a travel email confirmation

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:44.260
Just forward it to trips at tripcase.com. That's it. All the relevant details of your trip are now on your phone

01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:48.500
If there's a change in your itinerary if your flight is delayed or the gate changes

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:53.380
You'll be among the first to know tripcase can send you a push notification of changes if you give it the okay

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:57.700
It's about more than air travel though tripcase can help you plan your trip on the ground too

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.980
See details on your hotel check-in and out as part of your itinerary

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:05.380
See what the weather is like at your destination with a 10-day forecast. Is that perfect or what?

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:08.980
Tripcase has detailed maps of many airports, which is super handy

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:11.140
Especially if you have time to kill before you fly out

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:16.420
All right, decide what you want to do while you're visiting by pinning attractions appointments and stuff. You want to see on a map

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.900
You can even get driving directions or book a ride with uber with a couple of caps

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:26.340
Damn dude two cases free in the apple app store and in the google play store. All right links are directly below. Thanks. Kyra

01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:32.020
Thanks for watching subscribe to ting on youtube and get the latest app of the week episodes quick unboxings reviews and much more

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:34.580
until next time

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.820
Linux.ting.com

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:41.800
It's mobile that makes sense. Thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program

01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:44.900
Now let's roll into a few more updates just really quick

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:51.220
First one I like a lot here. This is a big one for the beard serious sam fusion 2017 is rolling into public beta

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:55.060
He says this is a great game. You ever played any serious sam. Oh, yeah, I have not

01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:58.180
Oh, actually, that's not true. I've played one. I've played one of the serious sam

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:03.380
also, there's going to be vr support and the other thing that's really big is

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:10.500
Vulcan support. In fact core team is bringing vulcan to their linux ports. This is another big publisher

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:15.620
That's going to be using vulcan. Awesome. Yeah, man. This is this is a huge deal actually. Uh, so

01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:20.360
It's in beta right now 64 bit vulcan multi-threaded rendering

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:23.940
Totally new save system all of that buzzwords, man

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:29.460
All the buzzwords buzzwords I love also while we're in the sort of media consumption category

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:34.260
This is no longer a valve update, but so we'll close the valve section. Goodbye. Um,

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.640
mozilla has proposed obsidian

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.240
Obsidian

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:45.640
Do you know what obsidian is? I don't well besides being obviously what the original user. Hold on. Hold on a second

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:51.160
Hold on west. I got you got this. We can't gotta get out of the I gotta get these out of my pajamas

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.160
But I feel like we can't go any further

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:57.720
I feel like I would be negligent. Yes, you would in my duties as a host of the show

01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.920
define obsidian

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:06.280
Obsidian a hard dark glass-like volcanic rock formed by the rapid

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.380
solidification of lava without crystallization

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:14.940
Obviously, I think the irc is right though. We can't forget about the obsidian order. Uh, you know, yes, right, right

01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:22.060
The obsidian order is uh, one of my favorite uh groups of uh spies that are directly modeled after our own cia

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:28.700
Which is pretty frightening. So obsidian has been published as a possible pro proposal from mozilla as the next web gl

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:30.700
technology

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:33.980
Yeah as a as something, you know, you probably stay hip to this

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:37.580
but the kronos group has been getting ready for web gl next

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:43.580
And they've been looking for for new proposals on the on the next version of web gl and guess who one of the first

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.220
to submit a proposal was

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:48.220
mozilla foundation

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:52.940
Uh, they say this is a draft proposal for the new gpu api for the web called obsidian

01:03:53.100 --> 01:04:00.240
It's a low level api that provides maximum feature set for the gpu to web applications. The api is designed for web assembly

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.240
Web assembly

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:09.040
Modern gpus and multi-threaded environments now web assembly just recently shipped in firefox as a default feature

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:15.360
It's kind of a big deal also shipping in chrome's latest I think version 53 and it's in web kits development builds

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.880
but not in any uh, like safari or anything, uh

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:26.640
Now mozilla already has a prototype that's been built into servo which provides a metal like api in web idl for javascript backed by

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:28.880
Vulcan

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:34.240
Yeah, so this this is this this is a big deal this obsidian thing could work out to for my reasons

01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:38.160
I'm glad mozilla is still around. Yeah. Yeah, because otherwise

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.960
Who knows who would be pushing this agenda? Yeah, exactly

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.600
Now I also wonder why we're in the media section

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:48.880
And I know we have we have a big conversation still to get into but I wanted to talk about this really quick

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:54.020
Because I think this is going to be one of those things that silently passes in the night, but it has long-term ramifications

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.040
Uh at midnight on march 20th

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.040
2017

01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:02.660
Dolby's last relevant patent on dolby digital

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.500
expired

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.020
So we're talking ac3 here

01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:12.340
So if you have ac3 audio in any television show you've ever captured any television show or movie you've ever downloaded

01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:20.260
Um, in fact some cameras record an ac3 audio all digital television is a it's mandatory actually for digital television

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:25.860
a lot of internet streams actually come in ac3 that are high fidelity netflix can use ac3 to give you a

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:27.860
Like a surround sound

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:35.060
Yeah, uh, and if you take out all references to dolby and any dolby properties, you can now ship ac3 technically

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:37.140
This is this is huge. It's out of patent now

01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:43.060
yeah, and uh, you can find out more at ac3 the number three freedom day.org and uh, if you

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:49.140
First of all, if you've ever played for the fluendo media pack like I have a couple of times you were paying for ac3

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:54.180
That's going to go away. Now. That's just you can just be included in the in the distro now, I would assume

01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:56.100
um

01:05:56.100 --> 01:06:00.100
And it also means that most live tv content can now be legally decoded

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:07.220
Most recorded tv content from like a pvr legally decoded videos from dvd or blu-ray the audio can be legally decoded now

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.140
um

01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:11.140
some camcorders and uh

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:16.420
Mostly netflix and maybe hulu that uses ac3 in their streams. I'm not sure

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:22.180
And maybe amazon anybody that offers but you see it a lot it established. Oh, yeah, man. Yeah, it's all over the place

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:26.100
So pretty much all of the videos I play back on my media box

01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:28.740
Probably have ac3 audio

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:30.340
Almost all of them

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:31.300
So that's a big deal

01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:34.500
And again, you can you can find a link in the show notes if if you want to check it out

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:39.780
I I it's funny because it's one of those things where one day you don't even notice it, right? It's just eventually

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:46.740
Distros will start. Well, it's been it's been six months. I haven't sued anybody like to get let's just include it

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:50.020
And then just all of a sudden you're just legally playing files. You didn't even realize

01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:52.020
Right. It's like it used to it used to be

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:54.660
back

01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.620
Back in my day

01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:02.900
We we couldn't even play mp3 files or mp4 files. You couldn't even play an h264 file, right?

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:05.780
And and and now the kids today

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:10.980
They're just they're just randomly playing mp3 files or randomly playing h264 files

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:15.060
And now their ac3 is just gonna work like nothing. They didn't they didn't buy a codec back

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:17.220
They didn't have to extract it put into a dot folder

01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:22.900
Right kids today. Yeah, there was no, you know sketchy. Ooh, uh g-streamer bad ugly. Ah,

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:27.140
Right. Yes. Oh my god. Oh, oh, man. All right

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:31.060
So there's a topic that i've been wanting to discuss and i'm really glad that noah's here because I think he's going to be

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:35.300
Uh somebody that's going to chime in on this. Uh, but before we go I got it

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:38.900
I gotta think I gotta do this because I even just recently

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:42.980
Just recently spun up a digital ocean droplet tried out an open source project

01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:47.300
Did a little hmm and ha and and then just destroyed the droplet and probably in two hours

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:52.900
I was done a digital ocean dot com go there and use our promo code do unplug to support the show

01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:58.580
This is a great way to get a linux rig with a crazy great 40 gigabyte connection all ssd storage

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:05.380
Kvm for the virtualizer with data centers in new york, san franc, singapore, afghan, london, toronto, germany and dimension b

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:10.420
They got them everywhere. You have a great control panel. That's really easy to use super intuitive

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:14.020
If you're a total noob that does barely kind of understands what a server is

01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:18.180
Maybe you've never even heard the team the term uh vps before or a droplet

01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:21.220
You're gonna be able to use this if you've been setting up virtual servers for a decade

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:26.260
You're gonna be able to use this and best it this is like do you use the api because i'm oh, yeah

01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:28.340
Oh, yeah, totally. Oh, man. I

01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:33.140
That's me throwing a piece of paper around because i'm so excited about the api

01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:36.660
For me, I use it every single day multiple times a day. What kind of things do you use it for?

01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:41.300
Well, I what my favorite part about one you can just use it like I mean i've used my own scripts

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:47.300
But because it's so easy a ton of community stuff like vagrant, right vagrant has a have a writer

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:51.860
Basically any scripting component they probably have a like drop in digital ocean

01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:55.300
Just you spin up a droplet you run your code there done couple of open source projects

01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:59.620
I've checked out have a button on their website that uses the api and you click the button and then it

01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:02.420
It just connects to your account and spins up a droplet with the whole stack

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:08.500
I'm going to lts docker a container with I mean, it's just like one button and you have the whole thing

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:16.180
And I feel like 2017 is up there right like even before some of the more maybe quote-unquote enterprise providers

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:18.660
You'll get a dio plug-in before you're going to get one

01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:21.780
Yeah, and and you know part of that too is they have incredible pricing

01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:25.060
So it starts at five dollars a month, but you can pay hourly too, which is nuts

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:30.260
And then on top they've layered on these incredible services that are integrated right into the dashboard

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:37.940
they're part of the api their their first class like load balancers block storage high ram systems like it's it's

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:41.220
Every move they have made has been really smart

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:46.660
And it's I think why they've just rocketed to the top digital ocean.com use our promo code dio unplug that lets them know

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:48.900
You heard about it here, which means they keep us going

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:53.700
But also it gives you a ten dollar credit try out the five dollar rig or my favorite

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:56.580
The three cents an hour rig with a ten dollar credit

01:09:56.580 --> 01:10:00.360
It really makes it there's there's several projects you could try with that digital ocean.com

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:04.980
Give it a go build your back end infrastructure your future website your personal blog

01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:10.100
Or just toy around and learn more at digital ocean.com dio unplugged is the promo code you use

01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:12.660
After you sign up

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:15.060
Let's do a little elephant in the room discussion

01:10:15.940 --> 01:10:19.060
There is uh, there is a real serious reality

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:24.340
It's not something that we're totally shy of but there's a real serious reality that for desktop linux to be relevant and be successful

01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:31.380
Long term, we're just going to have to have a whole crap ton of web apps universal apps. Maybe some are web assembly some are electron

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:32.900
just

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:35.940
A desktop full of them simple node slack

01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:37.940
skype

01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:39.940
everyday business tools

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:46.180
Web applications now and it's just going to there's everybody has their pet favorites. It's just going to increase right?

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:53.060
Um, and I thought I thought this was kind of an interesting blog post about uh setting a just a let's just embrace this

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:56.740
And set a dot web app file standard. So it's a file type

01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:00.600
Dot web app and it's a free desktop specification

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:04.580
And if you use something like natafire, which we're going to talk about a little bit more here in a second

01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:09.940
This would be a way to just make a real simple. Here's the way here's the dot file the dot web app

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.660
This is where you create this how you create the menu structure for it

01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:15.940
This is the icon all this stuff like it's like it's it's like a known standard

01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:20.580
And in part part of what I read this is like, oh geez, this is this is not the direction. I want things to go

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:21.940
so

01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:23.940
but then I thought about it it's like

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:29.140
You have tools like natafire you have people that are distributing their entire applications and electron like n1

01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:35.220
Yeah is one that I still use today. I mean how many people use uh, adam or visual studio totally every day. Absolutely

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:38.100
and in some ways

01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:44.600
This is critical for future expansion of the desktop I think for linux because it it's platform neutralizing

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:51.640
Uh, but we all are like intimately aware of what the problems are many of them are closed source completely closed source

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:55.320
Many of them require some sort of backend infrastructure, which is also closed source

01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:00.760
And in some cases has pervasive user tracking that violates your privacy and all of them so far

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:06.520
Seem to have a performance overhead when compared to native applications that is less than ideal

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.480
um, and so these are like obvious

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:15.000
Problems with that web applications, but then like at the same part the same time the advocate of me says

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:20.760
Yeah, but screw all that stuff. I want linux to be the successful prominent desktop platform one day

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:23.400
um

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.740
And you know there are some advantages

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:30.200
As time goes on I start to suspect that

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:38.760
Once again, we're never going to agree on a on a universal packaging format. There's going to be app images and flat packs and snaps

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:44.280
And we're never going to have a universal packaging format. It's never going to really be something that all distros support

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:47.400
It's never going to happen, but you know what is universal the web

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.480
so

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.480
Why not bypass all this bullshit?

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:56.200
All this crap that the linux community can't get their shit together around and just deliver a web app

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:58.360
plus

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.560
large industrial vendors like adobe and autocad and others

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.520
especially with things

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.840
Like mozilla's initiative around webgl next

01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:13.480
There could be like legitimate performance possibilities in an electron app in a web app

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:20.360
And and they could just bypass dot exe they can bypass dmgs. They can bypass flat packs

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:23.960
Here's the web app. Here's you can download for these different systems. Here's the web app

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:30.360
It almost and then plus the other benefit would be of course that it's available to a shit ton more developers and and people can target

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:37.240
Many platforms so it's much easier to carve out some revenue because you can get a couple of cheapo mac users to pay

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:41.800
You can get a few ten tens of thousands of windows users and a few linux enthusiasts to pay

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:44.680
And so you're not tied to one platform to make your money

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:49.800
So when microsoft finally kills the desktop and makes it just a linux based os and apple makes ios for the desktop

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.040
You you're not completely screwed. So

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:55.400
You're not completely screwed. So you've diversified your income sources

01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:03.320
So it's obvious for developers too because you bypass distribution standards you bypass app stores you bypass packaging issues you bypass dependent on a platform

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:09.720
It's a it mean like if i'm adobe and i'm going to commit the next 15 years of development to something

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:11.800
It almost seems like a foregone conclusion

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:17.560
Which means as linux users we have to accept that our future is going to be tied to back-end services that require monthly payments

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:24.760
Invade our privacy and web applications that don't run as fast as they should even though we now have these badass kit car

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.560
Style systems with an entirely open source platform

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.400
And we're running these closed source applications connected to closed source backends that run like shit

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:40.440
Is this a reality that we have to face and is there some sort of middle in here that i'm not seeing

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:44.680
What do you think wes and i'm gonna and after that i'm gonna i'd love to toss it around the chat room

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:48.200
I'd like joe's in here. I'd love to toss it to joe. See what he thinks kernel linux is in here

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.880
I'd like to get his thoughts, but i'll let you start. I think there's a lot of things they're tied together

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:55.080
Uh, especially especially the proprietary aspect. Um

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.400
We're gonna have proprietary software. We do already either way

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:05.240
I think there's a there's a legitimate case that's frequently made on this network that we do want that that we want that as part

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:10.360
Of our success whether whether or not an individual linux user wants that or not may be different right? We all have opinions there

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:11.880
um

01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:15.880
I think there is a good case that you know that we are tied to these backend services. But again

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:20.440
When you get google drive integration in files on gnome

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:22.200
That's the same thing, right?

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:28.360
Like you're still tied to proprietary service what the front end there doesn't really matter good point where I see it from the development side

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:34.040
I agree. Like there's some things that it makes sense for and some not uh, i'm running hyper.is or it's like the term

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:38.360
It's a terminal written in electron. I don't know if that makes sense. It's pretty snappy honestly terminal

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:43.000
Yes, I mean a generic, you know, you can run whatever shell you want in it. Really? Yeah

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.480
Here's a here's a shell. It feels very snappy. I've I only just installed it looks good

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:51.720
It's in an app image. It does let you then right you have the full html if you want

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:54.280
My mind is spinning right now and that's on the edge for me

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.400
I don't know if that makes sense, right?

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.840
And I wouldn't I wouldn't necessarily do like a tiny little app, right?

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:01.560
You don't need a full chrome thing just to draw a little bit

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:07.720
But on the flip side if you've spent your career developing interactive web apps, you're using d3 you're using other things

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:12.040
Are you really going to go spend your time learning gtk? No, maybe qt

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:15.560
I think qt has the strongest case right in terms of cross-platform availability

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:22.360
But what where where electron shines is because it's javascript and it's web and that is reach and if you're a developer with limited time

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:26.280
You're not excited about linux or windows or mac you're excited about the product you're making right?

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:27.880
But okay, so let me ask joe this so joe

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.760
What about the users though?

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:32.440
Because like one of the reasons I switched to linux is because I was sick of bad performance on other systems

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:35.080
One of the reasons I switched to linux is because I want a transparency of code

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:39.560
One of the reasons I switched to linux is because I wanted long-term visibility of where a project was going

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:44.600
And what's the point of having a gpl kernel and gpl user land tools in a gpl desktop environment?

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:49.000
If i'm running a closed source application, is this is this a compromise too far joe?

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:57.480
Well, I think it's not a compromise too far for most people because most pragmatic people will use a bit of proprietary software

01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:02.840
On the desktop regardless, but I think that you're kind of looking at this from the wrong angle here

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:08.280
You see you're talking about um these kind of consumer applications like skype

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.120
Although I suppose skype's a bit of a business application, but you see the thing is the desktop is

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:21.800
More or less dead or at least dying and everyone is moving to mobile right except for the professionals using

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:26.200
Big software like people that want to get their work done

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:32.280
Yeah, and that kind of stuff is it's very very difficult to make that into web apps, isn't it?

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:35.080
Yeah, well, I think today it is but I don't know about long term

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:41.880
And so you think that maybe long term that is the way to get I don't know if big video editors and stuff over to

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.760
God, I hope so in some ways

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.160
Because otherwise it's never going to happen

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.520
I really think the only choice I think the only the only

01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:55.560
Realistic shot that linux has is that adobe releases premiere for linux at this point

01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:59.100
And the only way they're going to do that is if there's something that is substantially

01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:03.900
Especially better to move to that is like the next 10 years plus for their platform

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:07.500
I would think otherwise why not just keep releasing native builds for windows and mac

01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:12.140
The other benefit maybe could be that it it does make it right if you can get better

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:18.540
Web acceleration use of those hardware components other things that you need the differentiated web app from a real app

01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:20.060
Then you've solved it for everyone

01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:23.500
But if you've got something like obsidian and you start getting like a standard for audio

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:26.540
And you start getting a standard for local database cache and stuff like that

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:29.020
You get to a point where you essentially have

01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:34.140
The workings of anything you could have made out of a java app or anything you could have made out of you know

01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:38.460
Something else it's it's it's in a runtime. I I feel like you get actually pretty damn close

01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:42.300
What you're talking about is the web browser becoming the operating system

01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:42.940
Yeah

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:49.100
In a sense or or an electron app or a natify or something like that where it's it's using those technologies

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:51.100
But it pretends to be a desktop application

01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:54.140
And I don't I don't like it really

01:18:54.140 --> 01:18:58.540
And in fact see current linux I wanted to ask you because it seems like a huge component to all of these is then they

01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:01.580
Always it's not just that it's a web or an electron app

01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:07.660
It's also that it's it's cloud dependent and and you have the whole lock-in now to a cloud service

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:12.940
Which has all kinds of uh long-term ramifications, which could be one of them being shut down

01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:14.940
And so this could be another issue where all of a sudden

01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:21.100
One of the benefits of desktop linux was with open source native applications a developer might decide to quit one day

01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:25.980
But if you if your business depended on it, hey you fork the shit out of that thing run an internal build and hire

01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.700
Somebody to keep it going and that was an actual possibility

01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:35.680
But right now if nalais decides to pull the plug on n1 i'm totally screwed my desktop application becomes completely

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:39.180
Non-functional and you that's got to bother you colonel linux

01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:43.980
And you know additionally to that when you start looking at independent content creators now

01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:47.580
We're taking our content things that we've spent our money time and effort

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:51.100
And we're putting that up into the cloud and you know

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:55.500
A lot of us would say well, you know in the case of video editing, you know and stuff like that

01:19:55.580 --> 01:20:01.100
Especially for adobe. They wouldn't do anything, you know terrible with it. But a lot of times what you see is as they change

01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:03.660
uh to accommodate

01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:06.300
Users that don't want to pay a lot of money. So for example in facebook

01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:10.140
When it started out you uploaded a bunch of media. That was all your media

01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:12.700
It was your pictures your videos that kind of thing then later on

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:17.020
They started changing the user agreement so that they could use some of some of that stuff

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:20.700
And so anytime you have content that you've created on somebody else's computer

01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:25.660
I think that's that's a dangerous thing anytime you're running your business based on someone else's computer. I think that's a dangerous thing

01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:27.740
hmm

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:28.780
So

01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:33.420
I don't have a real way to like spin this into like a happy go lucky hara desktop linux thing

01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:38.940
I guess I would just like to to point out that you can have an entirely open source electron app, right?

01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:40.220
The whole framework is open source

01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:45.100
If you want to improve it to not use as much memory or whatever and you're capable of doing that you totally can yeah

01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:50.060
Now also use electron with offline apps. You don't need to be online either. Yeah now rotten

01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:51.740
Producer michael

01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:53.740
I wanted to give you a chance also to sort of touch on

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:58.620
On your thoughts on using nata fire to take some of these applications and make it essentially feel like a local app

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.180
Because that's sort of I mean where we're going

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:07.980
Well, I mean I i've been using nata fire for a little while and i've built like probably 10 of my own apps with it

01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:09.900
um

01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:11.180
It can do a lot of

01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:15.180
It's really interesting because its purpose is to kind of like auto build an electron app for you

01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:22.220
You give it uh, tell it what you have in node and npm installed and you have uh electron in your system

01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:27.820
And then it just uses electron to build everything for you based on the command the parameters you use in the command

01:21:28.380 --> 01:21:31.980
And then it just builds it and it gives you like a full folder that's portable

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:37.340
But it also integrates with your system. So it uses your home folder to store the config files

01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:42.320
So you can remake a new version with a new electron when it comes out, uh, you can have notifications

01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:45.900
Built into your put whatever pretty much whatever de you want

01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:48.460
um, like there's there's a lot of

01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:53.020
Great tools for it. And the best part about it is that you can build your own

01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:56.060
um your own apps

01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:59.820
without having to deal with uh any kind of services like

01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.220
I got mine. I have like

01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:07.660
Like I have stuff that's on my server that is you know, it is it is a cloud service that is running on my server

01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:09.980
That is using electron to do it to use it

01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:15.740
That's cool. All right, so that's kind of that's sort of like a that's a middle ground. That's good. That's good

01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:19.340
That's a middle ground. I was looking for less depressed than we thought we thank you producer

01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:22.380
Michael you gave us the middle ground that we were hoping for

01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:22.860
All right

01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:25.840
Now if you have a little middle ground and you want to share your thoughts go over to jupitabroadcasting.com

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:28.380
contact

01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:32.480
Of course, you can also go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com

01:22:32.700 --> 01:22:34.380
although

01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.380
bit of a shit show right now, so

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:43.740
Probably probably would maybe just find us on twitter or or join us live. Yeah, that'd be good jblive.tv for the live show

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:51.420
I'm at chris las i'm at westpacethenetworks at jupiter signal also go follow colonel linux at colonel linux on the network

01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:55.680
Uh, he's over there doing his thing and tweeting about all his shenanigans

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:59.200
And also we appreciate the mumble room for joining us. You can also join that

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:02.800
Just check out the chat room at jblive.tv do a bang mumble get the info

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:25.780
We do a little mic check and you can join us. We'll see you right back here next tuesday

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:38.800
And the value of this is negative

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:47.840
JBtitles.com everybody go over there. We'll pick our title and then we will get out of here for the tech snap crew

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:50.820
Thank you for being here everybody jbtitles.com

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:59.920
Uh, also, I just want to point out another way about uh etcher is awesome. Oh, yeah etcher is I forgot about etcher damn

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:04.640
That's a that is actually the counter example right there etcher for etcher for the win

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:10.640
And i've actually been uh studying up on app images with uh with electron based stuff

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:13.360
and uh, it's really cool like

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:18.080
I like app images a lot more than I used to because after researching it

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.800
It's uh, I kind of like app images more than flat packs now

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:27.200
The first time I used etcher that was the first time I used uh app image and I was just I was blown away

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:29.200
Like it was it was one of those moments

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:32.400
Where the thing downloads I double click on it and I click on install and i'm like

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:39.280
Why why is not every application on linux using this and why haven't we been doing it for 20 years?

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:40.640
All right

01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:42.080
I did it on my arch desktop

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:43.440
Then I did it on my fedora laptop

01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:47.440
Then I did it on my bungee laptop the same freaking file runs on every single distro

01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:53.360
Share share share share. We need to pick a title jb title share. We need to pick it to jimmy share

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:56.320
We need jimmy titles. Sure. We need to pick a title jimmy titles.com

01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:58.960
Chris loves that's funny

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:00.960
Sandboxing now too. Oh, really?

01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:06.800
Pack attack solace my solace getting in the limitations with app images as well

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:09.920
Of course, but there's also limitations when flat packs as well

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:16.000
Well games not the same limitations with an app image you'll run into library issues. Oh

01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:19.200
Yeah, so they might bundle some of the libraries

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:23.680
But you're still going to run into the sort of issues that you would have if you just downloaded a terrible and running it from

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:24.720
That route

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:29.060
Whereas if you use something like flat pack, you've got a fully contained root fs essentially

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:36.560
You've got an entire trip environment because they've changed app images changed how they do their stuff within uh, like four or five months ago

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:40.560
They're now using squash fs now. So there's no yeah, that's right, but that's squash fs

01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:46.480
That's just a bind mount that's gone into the true. It doesn't have a full troop. So the system libraries can still contaminate

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:51.120
That's one of the problems app image is very very attractive because you can just double click it and go for it

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:57.120
As norah said but you can still get those issues. So they do need to be watched out for if you use a sandboxing

01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.280
That's not going to happen

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.840
That's what I just said for example

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:05.520
No fire jail on type of app image. You're not going to have those problems

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:10.560
Or you could just use one that works out of the box without layers, right?

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:15.200
But when you have to install flat pack into your system and then your system doesn't work in any way and then annoying

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:21.120
And it gives you these like ridiculously obscure errors and the only and the actual solution is to reboot your machine

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:24.800
But the but the the system doesn't tell you that because that's that'd be too easy

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:29.120
You had the quark errors as well then yeah, it's ridiculous

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:35.440
It's like hey you're missing this thing like why am I missing it? Oh because I didn't reboot. Oh, yeah

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:37.520
Thanks, you could have just told me I need to reboot

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:41.840
Yeah, it's not kind of has the usability upper hand there a little bit

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:46.480
Yeah, but uh, there's there's a thing I think the app image is only there's it's only flaw

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:50.000
Not really only flaw because the sandboxing is a problem, but they have a solution for that

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:54.880
The only main thing that they don't have a solution for is the updating method like uh, yeah

01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:00.480
Yeah, they had a self-updater. That would be nice. So they have a built-in updating daemon

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.280
But the app image it has to implement it

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:09.840
It doesn't um, it only does it when you when you launch it. So like it says, okay, here's an update

01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.960
so it does work, but the app images developer has to use it and you know, there's

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:22.480
It is really cool and also like a mac a lot of people well, it's more mac than not but it is but a lot of um,

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:25.280
People think that app images bundles everything and they don't

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:28.880
App images only bundle what's necessary to bundle if the system

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:34.240
If an app image can assume that a package is available, like, you know a super massive

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:37.600
You know global package. It's not going to be bundled

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.600
You
