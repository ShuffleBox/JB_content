00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Holy smokes, this man builds a giant computer in his home.

00:03.000 --> 00:11.000
It's a 16-bit mega processor, 14,000 individual transistors, and 3,500 LED lights.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
It's going to have seven panels like the one they're picturing here when it's finished.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
How about that?

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
It's costing about $20,000, he's told the BBC News.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
Mr. Newman said he hoped it would have education of value,

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
but it would be hard to transport as well as likely to weigh about half a ton once he's finished.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
The bits of the processor light up as they operate,

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
but other than that the entire machine operates the same as a standard chip-sized microprocessor

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
found in all computers.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
I was taken by the idea of being able to see how the thing works, Mr. Newman said.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
I have a visual way of thinking about things,

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
and I want to be able to see how a computer works and see how things flow around with it.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
I intended this as a learning exercise, and man have I learned a lot.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
The processor that powers the Michigan Micro Note,

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
the world's smallest computer, is a fraction of the size of a penny.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
He's saying this in a capture here.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
He says he's now relying on determinedness to get through it.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
He says he is concerned about the space the processor takes, which is about two meters high.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
He says when it's set up, it takes up the entire living room.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
There's not much space left for living.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
One of his fantasies is to line the hallway with it.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
My friend thinks I'm mad, but they're also slightly jealous that I allow myself to do it.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Look at that, he's building a 16-bit computer.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
Oh my god, if he can run Linux on there, he should come on the show.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Wow.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
That makes me feel like that is a summer project that somebody should send to the FoShow.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
That makes me feel like my summer projects are kind of lame.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.000
This guy, it's going to take him a long time to build something like that, but that is so neat.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
And to see it light up as the computer works, man, that's Star Trek. I want that.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Now Wimpy, I don't want to ask this question and imply that you're old,

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
but you've been around for a while, watching the Linux scene for a while.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
Okay, I hope you don't take that the wrong way.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
I'm sure there's a compliment bursting to get out somewhere here, Chris.

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
Well, you have keen observational skills of the landscape,

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
and I'm sure that with your keen observational skills, have you noticed every year or two,

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
maybe it's just me, but I swear these articles come up like, what if Linus dies?

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
And it's like this theoretical piece of what happens if Linus dies, what happens to Linux?

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
And it seems like we're a little obsessed with what happens if Linus dies. Have you seen this?

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah, it's not the first time I've seen this.

02:26.000 --> 02:33.000
Maybe in the first few years, it had some credence, but now Linux is just so huge.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.000
There's so many mega corporations behind it. There's so many thousands of developers responsible.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
There's so many subsystem maintainers.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.000
I don't want to wish an early demise upon Linus,

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
but if he does have a disastrous diving accident, then I think we'll all mourn his loss

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
and we'll all reflect on what he's delivered to the world, but Linux will carry on.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Isn't that good? And you know what, Linus says just as much, really.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
So the reason why I'm getting to this is because Bloomberg had a piece up over the weekend,

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
and I totally intentionally ignored the entire article.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.000
Even though it was about Linus and Linux, I saw that headline and I went, not this again.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Are they just trolling for clicks?

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
Do they have it on a calendar and they get a reminder that it's time to write about this?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I don't really want to fall for it.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
So at first I ignored it, but I checked it out after, I guess yesterday?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Yeah, after noon.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
And it turns out there's actually kind of an interesting video attached with it,

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
so I wanted to play that for us because maybe you guys might have avoided it like I did.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Maybe you didn't, but either way, it's got a great interview with Linus,

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
and I wanted to play a little bit of this.

03:46.000 --> 03:54.000
The thing I really enjoy about programming is just the fact that you really can tell the computer exactly what to do,

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
and it will do what you tell it and nothing more.

03:59.000 --> 04:07.000
I don't know, maybe I'm autistic or something, or borderline, but that doesn't happen in normal life.

04:07.000 --> 04:19.000
I'm Linus Torvalds. I'm mainly known for being the guy who started and still maintains Linux.

04:19.000 --> 04:24.000
The first computer I used was my grandfather's Commodore VIC-20.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
I think I was 11 or 12.

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
The computer used a very traditional language called BASIC.

04:34.000 --> 04:43.000
My sister says that the first thing I showed her was the one that everybody starts with when you're doing BASIC,

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
is 10, print, and you print a string, and 20, go to 10.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
And that's basically saying, print that string forever.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
She claims that I made it right out.

04:57.000 --> 05:05.000
She's the best, which to me sounds very unlikely because we weren't necessarily always the best of friends,

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
but maybe I was trying to be nice and impress her with my programming skills.

05:10.000 --> 05:19.000
It didn't start out very serious, but by the time I was 15, that was what I did.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
You see code. You don't have to even think about it.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
You look at something and you know what it does.

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
If you're not a programmer, you would think it's almost noise.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
But if you've been doing it a long time, you can read it like any other language.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
You can write code that looks beautiful but just doesn't actually solve the problem,

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
which is why I'm still doing the same project 25 years later.

05:46.000 --> 05:53.000
It's because it's hard to write good code.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
Well, I think the big takeaway from that interview, of course, obviously, is that Linus Torvalds uses Gnome 3.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
No? Did you guys pick up anything else? I thought that was a good chat.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
I like Linus. He's turning into a very nice, wise old man.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
Not old, though. I mean, I gotta stop that.

06:13.000 --> 06:20.000
Yeah, I don't think Linus has ever been an apologist for anything that he's done or how he behaves and conducts himself.

06:20.000 --> 06:27.000
He is who he is and he's just accepted that and he expects the rest of the world to accept it as well.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Yeah.

06:28.000 --> 06:38.000
This was one of the reasons why I found that whole code of conduct episode a little bit disappointing.

06:38.000 --> 06:51.000
Because, you know, how many open source projects have still got the founder at the helm after 25 years?

06:51.000 --> 07:01.000
And he is still at the helm of Linux. And no, sock puppet, I don't have a clean desk. You've got no idea.

07:01.000 --> 07:09.000
When I had to do the UOS thing, I had to put blankets over all of the crap behind me.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
And the code of conduct I felt was, you know, unfortunate for not Linus so much, but Linux as a whole,

07:16.000 --> 07:25.000
because that sort of anarchic quality of Linux that has made it what it is was kind of being threatened a little bit by that.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
But it hasn't really come to anything.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Interesting. You're right. You're right. You're right.

07:28.000 --> 07:36.000
No, actually, I don't know. I feel like it did sort of, something did sort of shift a little bit.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Really? We heard anything about it since?

07:38.000 --> 07:45.000
No, but, well, kind of. So Greg Kh wrote up, you know, he wrote that code of conduct, right?

07:45.000 --> 07:56.000
And I feel like, well, I don't know. You know, here's what I wonder is if maybe we're just not asking for them just to conduct things behind private doors.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.000
Right? Like if that's not eventually what the end result will be, is they'll just move the discussion to some sort of private,

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
like they'll still keep important stuff public, but you know what I mean?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Like it probably already happens to some degree, I suppose.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
I don't know. I guess I'm not totally willing to say nothing's come of it. I don't know, though.

08:13.000 --> 08:21.000
I feel like you're touching on something there that is actually really bothersome to me, though.

08:21.000 --> 08:36.000
Like there's sort of like a fire he brings to the project, and if you dampen it out to make it more palatable to everybody,

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
sort of what makes it sort of that edge and makes it special kind of goes away. Is what you're saying?

08:41.000 --> 08:51.000
Yeah, I do. I'm not talking necessarily about the way that some of the developers conduct themselves

08:51.000 --> 08:59.000
and how their relationships and messaging toward other people of their community constructed,

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
but it's more about how Linux as a whole was created and emerged.

09:05.000 --> 09:14.000
And unlike Unix, which was, there's this core base system that works in harmony and unison,

09:14.000 --> 09:21.000
Linux was, we're just going to grab all these bits and stitch it together and make a system like Unix.

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
Which on the face of it is so, looking back at it, no one will ever use that for anything serious.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
That's going to be so haphazard.

09:29.000 --> 09:40.000
Yeah, and you know, I think now what we're 20 odd years in, and now it's things like Docker and core OS and containers

09:40.000 --> 09:49.000
that are trying to sort of rationalize and consolidate that, for want of a better description, mess into something predictable

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
that you can then put your mess into, into sandboxes.

09:54.000 --> 10:04.000
And what was announced yesterday, what was announced yesterday is that Docker, core OS, Azure, EC2 folks,

10:04.000 --> 10:12.000
I mean like a lot of the industry, including the Linux Foundation, are standardizing on some of these container and runtime specs.

10:12.000 --> 10:19.000
So it's funny, containerization is exactly what you just said Wimpy, it's bringing some sort of order to all of this

10:19.000 --> 10:25.000
quote-unquote chaos, and who's in the best interest of that is these big commercial companies because they want to be able

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
to deliver products on this platform now.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
And when they want to be able to deliver products, they want to be able to deliver them in a way that makes them money,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
and in a way that they can reliably reproduce.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
And so here comes containers.

10:35.000 --> 10:40.000
Now containers are here for lots of reasons, but now all of a sudden, all these different various interests working together

10:40.000 --> 10:46.000
like this, all Kumbaya style, all of a sudden it became a lot of people's best interest to sort of solve this problem under Linux,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
and it's coming at us really fast.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
Yeah, and it's being solved for the right reasons.

10:52.000 --> 11:02.000
I know you mentioned that you wanted to talk about the Chrome package having, you know, being able to download a blob.

11:02.000 --> 11:11.000
And it's the very fact that, you know, whilst you're installing a package, that package has root over your system

11:11.000 --> 11:22.000
during the install process. So consequently, that package had it been submitted by a Debian maintainer to Debian,

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
it probably wouldn't have passed through the FTP masters because they would have spotted this behaviour

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
and would have stamped it out and wouldn't have allowed it in.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.000
But just because it's a Debian package doesn't mean that it can't do things that it shouldn't,

11:35.000 --> 11:47.000
because that Debian package is distributed by Google, you know, for Google Chrome, and Chromium kind of got tainted with it.

11:47.000 --> 11:59.000
But the containerisation and things like snap packages and click packages and the other similar technologies that will emerge in due course

11:59.000 --> 12:07.000
are all about not giving that package root during the install so that it is completely sandboxed.

12:07.000 --> 12:14.000
Here's what I find interesting about this is it's definitely in some distributions best interest to really be on board.

12:14.000 --> 12:22.000
Like there's an obvious reason why Canonical wants to invest in Ubuntu Snappy and why Red Hat's looking at Project Atomic

12:22.000 --> 12:33.000
and all of these things, right? I don't totally grok what the incentive is for the 100% community based distros

12:33.000 --> 12:40.000
or distros that don't really have a large commercial presence. What's their benefit for following suit like this?

12:40.000 --> 12:47.000
Why should Arch ever want to transition to a transactional based package system, right? Or Debian mainline?

12:47.000 --> 12:56.000
I wonder if we're going to start to see a new division among the distributions here, more so than enterprise versus personal distro.

12:56.000 --> 13:10.000
It's possible. It's very early days. Having spoken to some of the developers for Snappy and snap packages and click packages

13:10.000 --> 13:17.000
and tried to learn about it and understand it, I've come to the conclusion I just need to sit on the sidelines

13:17.000 --> 13:26.000
and watch what happens for this development cycle and then learn from what comes out of that and use that as reference material

13:26.000 --> 13:34.000
because it isn't clear to me at the moment whether this is solving a problem that someone like me doesn't need to solve

13:34.000 --> 13:44.000
or if there is some value. One potential value I can see is somebody that works on a desktop environment

13:44.000 --> 13:54.000
actually packaging up the desktop as lots of discrete packages and in some cases taking something that we spit out upstream

13:54.000 --> 14:05.000
and then splitting that into multiple packages, you know, with the suffix common, the debug symbols, the headers for dev,

14:05.000 --> 14:14.000
the, you know, the different applications, but based on what, you know, audio library they may use.

14:14.000 --> 14:24.000
Just being able to say, right, here's the Marte desktop 1.10.0, the whole thing and you just install this one thing

14:24.000 --> 14:34.000
and this one thing arrives as one lump and when there is an update, you just get the whole of 10.1

14:34.000 --> 14:46.000
and it would be much easier for the upstream package maintainers to actually roll out whether they're SNAPs or atomic packages

14:46.000 --> 14:54.000
or whatever it might be, it would be easier to actually just shift the whole desktop environment out as the whole thing.

14:54.000 --> 15:02.000
Yeah. Yeah, boy, that would be awesome. And NorthRanger, you wanted to make a comment about how the Linux Foundation's involvement is key here.

15:02.000 --> 15:16.000
Yeah, I think if you look back at the history of Linux distribution, there's always been this separation based on packaging formats.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
Yeah, I mean, you mean like between dev and RPM distros?

15:19.000 --> 15:27.000
Exactly. And those were always driven by the distributions, whereas the community development Linux in general,

15:27.000 --> 15:35.000
they just focused on the kernel and didn't get involved. Well, Linux, Greg, Crow, KH, they work for Linux Foundation.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
They're now involved in this container consortium.

15:39.000 --> 15:48.000
So are they going to be the voice of the community to try to rationalize what all of these different corporate interests are?

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
Yeah, I mean, because there are some very conflicting interests here.

15:51.000 --> 15:59.000
When I was looking at the list just a little bit while we were chatting, I mean, first of all, I'm really, really happy to see CoreOS get some play here

15:59.000 --> 16:03.000
because they had a really good spec. They came up with some good stuff.

16:03.000 --> 16:09.000
And I'm really pleased to see that the Docker guys didn't just be like, ah, screw that, we got to do our own thing.

16:09.000 --> 16:14.000
Like, they're all kind of working together. So that's really awesome.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
I'm glad that's starting to happen. I don't know how that happened behind the scenes.

16:18.000 --> 16:23.000
I'm trying to find out all the different companies that were involved with this project.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
But it's, yeah, it's pretty massive.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
Docker, CoreOS, Google, Microsoft, Amazon are some of them.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
I'm looking at the TechCrunch article right now.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
By the way, if you didn't know, DockerCon was this week.

16:37.000 --> 16:43.000
We talked about it on Coda Radio. I think it's 159, 158. Is this Monday? It's Coda Radio.

16:43.000 --> 16:50.000
Google, Microsoft, Amazon, CoreOS, HP, WAHI, IBM, Intel, JoyNet, Cisco, EMC,

16:50.000 --> 16:58.000
Apprecia, Fujitsu Limited, Red Hat, VMware, Pivotal, Rancher, Metasphere, and others are all in this coalition.

16:58.000 --> 17:03.000
Holy shit. Goldman Sachs is even in there?

17:03.000 --> 17:13.000
I mean, Google, Microsoft, Docker, and CoreOS got billing, but the fact that Cisco, and Red Hat, and VMware,

17:13.000 --> 17:21.000
and Intel, and IBM, and HP, and EMC, and Cisco are in there?

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
Well, I think this is sort of a done deal, isn't it?

17:26.000 --> 17:34.000
So, Linux's Docker Container Standards, I think we have it, ladies and gentlemen. We have it.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
And there's other ones out there. I mean, there are definitely other ones out there.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I think even Canonical has their own.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
Wow, how about that?

17:43.000 --> 17:50.000
So, CoreOS and Docker are going to work together and other stakeholders on the Open Container Project,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
which will be housed under the Linux Foundation.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
The RCP is a non-profit organization that is chartered to establish common standards for software containers.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
The Docker Container Format and Runtime will form the basis of the new standard.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
So, I want to read that again, because that's the important part.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
The Docker Container Format and Runtime will form the basis of the new standard,

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
and Docker is donating both the draft specifications and the code around its image format and runtime engines

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
to the project to get it started.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
That's awesome.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
So, yeah, wow.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
With the announcement of the Open Container Project, Docker is telling the world that they are open to this discussion.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
CoreOS founder, Alex Pivil, writes,

18:29.000 --> 18:35.000
Today Docker is the de facto image format for containers, and therefore it's a great place to start as a standard.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
We still feel that there are many technical issues existing in the Docker format,

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
but having a neutral seat at the table will help address these from the industry overall.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
That's coming from the CoreOS guy.

18:48.000 --> 18:54.000
For Docker, this means giving up a bit of control after receiving feedback from the community, partners, and customers.

18:54.000 --> 19:00.000
We believe the timing is right to create a common standard for the world,

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
and will ensure compatibility and encourage innovation throughout the ecosystem.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
That's the Docker's open source initiative guy.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.000
Wow, so there you go. That's a huge deal, and that just developed this week.

19:11.000 --> 19:28.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 98 for June 23, 2015.

19:28.000 --> 19:35.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that is just going to live with its caffeine addiction, okay?

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
My name is Chris. Episode 98 is going to be a fun episode.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
I was putting it together today, and I realized, man, parts of this are really scratchy and itch,

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
something that feels familiar, but I haven't been there in a while, a place I haven't visited.

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
I realized it kind of has a bit of a system admin bent to it, a little bit.

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
We're going to cover a couple of interesting bits of feedback that have come in from the audience first in the show,

19:56.000 --> 20:03.000
then a really cool way to deploy Linux throughout your network very simply, very powerfully, without a lot of work.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
We're going to talk about that. Then that kind of started to stoke.

20:05.000 --> 20:12.000
I think that sis Abin fired me, so to kind of finish that off, we're going to bring on, I think his name is James or Jim.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
We have an interview with somebody from the OpenNoid project.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Now, this is a fascinating development.

20:18.000 --> 20:23.000
It's going to make system administration, it's going to bring it to a whole new level.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
It's going to make it so much easier.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
For those of you out there that have a couple of systems to manage or work with virtualization,

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
from like a couple of boxes, man, I'm talking like two to thousands, this is a really fascinating solution.

20:33.000 --> 20:40.000
Noah had a chance to run in with him at Linux Fest, sat down, got a demonstration of how this software works,

20:40.000 --> 20:46.000
how the project works, what the UI looks like, how you can roll back machines across your network, really cool things.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
We'll show that in today's episode, really neat stuff.

20:48.000 --> 20:56.000
Then later on, towards the end of the show, we've got to talk about this binary blob that Chromium was downloading to turn on your microphone.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Yeah, you probably heard about this.

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
Is this the line? Have we finally crossed that line?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
We're going to talk about that with the mumble room in a little bit.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
We've got some stuff to get into, so why don't we do the first thing?

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
We've got to do the first order of business. Let's bring in that virtual lug.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Good evening.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Hello.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
Hello.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.000
Greetings.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.000
Good evening, hello, and welcome to episode 98 of the Linux Unplugged program.

21:20.000 --> 21:27.000
This article was submitted into the show today, and it kind of made me go, oh yeah, what about that?

21:27.000 --> 21:33.000
I started a poll, and then I'm going to submit to the chat room here as I start to ask this question.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
I'll start with you, mumble room, since you are an immediate feedback.

21:37.000 --> 21:42.000
Is anybody in the room right now using Linux on the desktop with a touch device?

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
I'm not talking about your phone. I'm not talking about Android.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
Are you using Linux, like a distribution that we all know, connected to a touch device somehow?

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
I just put a straw poll in the chat room. I would like you to vote.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
Now, I actually am not. I used to have a connection to the Bonobo, but for the moment I do not.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
So I just voted no.

21:59.000 --> 22:05.000
While those votes come in, I was pointed over to this article at MakeTechEasier.com.

22:05.000 --> 22:10.000
This is, what are the best Linux desktops have touch screen support?

22:10.000 --> 22:16.000
This guy rounds up, and he says that Gnome is number one. Unity is number two. I'm not sure why.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.000
He goes through and gives different tips on how to make them even more touch friendly.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.000
But in here, he says, when it comes to touch, Linux still has a long, long way to go.

22:25.000 --> 22:33.000
With touch screen-based computers becoming incredibly popular, it's never been more apparent that Linux developers need to step up their game.

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
And remember, Gnome and Unity were both very much built around touch. Unity has great touch support.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
Plasma and Plasma Active have great touch support.

22:42.000 --> 22:47.000
So, anybody in the mumble room right now using a touch screen? Anybody?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
On one computer, yes.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
And Wimpy? On one computer.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
Okay, one computer. Like laptops, guys?

22:53.000 --> 22:56.000
Yeah, Chromebook.

22:56.000 --> 23:09.000
I've got an old Dell Mini 9 that I bought a touch screen kit for and retrofitted a touch screen onto just to experiment with.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
Yeah. And that's the only one with a touch screen.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.000
I bought a Dell touch screen to experiment with, and I like it.

23:16.000 --> 23:27.000
But, you know, it is – I feel like it's – I don't feel like it's unfair to say that, like, Gnome was pretty much designed around the concept that touch was going to take over the desktop.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
And I feel like here we are in 2015, and that seems like that was a bad bet.

23:32.000 --> 23:39.000
That was a really – and in fact, some of the best stuff that's been brought to Gnome has made it more appropriate for a standard desktop.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
And when you look at what Red Hat ships, they ship Gnome Classic, essentially.

23:43.000 --> 23:49.000
And as you look at our straw poll right now, 94% of the votes are no on touch screen.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
6% of the votes, yes on touch screen.

23:53.000 --> 23:58.000
So what the hell happened? What went wrong?

23:58.000 --> 24:05.000
I don't think that the input and output device can be the same thing.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
It's just never going to work.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
It's just simply a fact that this type of computer is just better with a mouse and keyboard.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
I don't know about that, but yeah, maybe.

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
One thing I know that I don't like having my hand in front of the content, is that what you mean?

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Yeah, exactly.

24:19.000 --> 24:29.000
How are you making or consuming content whilst your grubby mitts are all over it?

24:29.000 --> 24:35.000
And that's not to say that – obviously, phones and tablets have been very popular,

24:35.000 --> 24:42.000
but we're now starting to see a drop off on tablet adoption and people now starting to buy computers again.

24:42.000 --> 24:48.000
And I think that everyone's learned where a computer has its place, a traditional computer with a keyboard and a mouse,

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
and where a tablet has its place.

24:50.000 --> 24:56.000
And I think maybe the keyboard and mouse have got their days numbered,

24:56.000 --> 25:03.000
but I think we'll just find better ways for interacting with computers for those people that are making stuff.

25:03.000 --> 25:09.000
Whether you're a computer programmer or a musician or a graphics designer,

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
I think there will be better tools coming along for us to use.

25:14.000 --> 25:23.000
And maybe we'll transition to using tablets as a display device connected to these other devices for creating content,

25:23.000 --> 25:30.000
but then also use that screen disconnected from those devices for consumption of content.

25:30.000 --> 25:37.000
Do you, Wimpy, think that this failed bet on touch on the desktop is sort of –

25:37.000 --> 25:43.000
are we seeing blowback from that in sort of the form of the adoption of Ubuntu Mate?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
No.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
You don't think so?

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
I think Dome 3 and Unity went too far in the touch direction and people wanted a more traditional desktop,

25:51.000 --> 25:57.000
and I think that bears out in the response to Ubuntu Mate.

25:57.000 --> 26:07.000
I think that the people that were going to use Ubuntu Mate were already using distributions like Ubuntu Mate before I came along with that.

26:07.000 --> 26:14.000
I think you've got people that are prepared to use that computer in that way.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
I'm not saying it's the – okay, maybe I should put it this way.

26:17.000 --> 26:22.000
It's sort of a land of salvation then. How about that?

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
Yeah, but it's no different from any of the other distributions that have been out there.

26:27.000 --> 26:36.000
So Zubuntu, KDE to a large extent, and Kubuntu, and all of the Linux Mint versions,

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
they all cater towards that traditional desktop metaphor.

26:41.000 --> 26:46.000
Ubuntu Mate is not doing anything different in terms of the general user interface.

26:46.000 --> 26:50.000
We've got a couple of little tweaks and tricks and what have you,

26:50.000 --> 26:56.000
but every distribution has to have something that separates it from the rest of the crowd.

26:56.000 --> 27:04.000
I think we'll see more touch – I mean I've got friends that have got computers with touchscreens and run Linux,

27:04.000 --> 27:11.000
and they do use the touchscreens but not as the primary way that they interact with the computer.

27:11.000 --> 27:16.000
So they use the touchpad, they use the keyboard, but when they say go to shut the computer down

27:16.000 --> 27:20.000
and it pops up the prompt, do you want to restart, reboot, or log off,

27:20.000 --> 27:26.000
they actually touch the button on the screen for log off, reboot, and things of that nature.

27:26.000 --> 27:35.000
So they use it for a few sort of interactions but not as the main way that they actually drive the device.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
So more of a convenience for some things.

27:37.000 --> 27:43.000
That's how I see Angela using her yoga is sort of like it's like every now and then she'll unlock the screen that way,

27:43.000 --> 27:49.000
move a window really quick or scroll something as just like a random way to just interact with it.

27:49.000 --> 27:59.000
And my touch screen that I've got on my device is resistive, so it's kind of antiquated.

27:59.000 --> 28:04.000
But I could say that if you were looking at map data, for example,

28:04.000 --> 28:11.000
it would be easier to move around a representation of a map on a computer with a touch screen

28:11.000 --> 28:17.000
by using the touch screen because we've got accustomed to that on our phone and tablet than using a mouse and keyboard.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.000
So there are some applications where it's better.

28:20.000 --> 28:26.000
And this is why I think things are going to come along that are better than the keyboard and the mouse.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Yeah, good point.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
I think that is well put.

28:28.000 --> 28:34.000
MiniMC, you want to make a point about how resolution on the desktop sometimes matters.

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
Like I have like a 2K monitor on my desktop.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Yeah, it's a question of finger size.

28:39.000 --> 28:46.000
I mean, if you have a full HD display with a normal laptop, it's very easy to –

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
it's not easy to find the point really to touch on the screen.

28:50.000 --> 28:56.000
But with a bigger resolution like the one I have now, it's better.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
It's working somehow.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
It's not a full HD resolution I have.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
So the touch targets are a little more friendly.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
Yeah, much more friendly.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.000
Yeah.

29:06.000 --> 29:14.000
How do you want to kill an application if you have to point at that X and you don't touch that X at the right corner and it doesn't close?

29:14.000 --> 29:15.000
Right, yeah.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Yeah, that does make sense.

29:17.000 --> 29:20.000
And the icon launchers are going to be more like towards the size of your fingers.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
So when you're nubbing it, you're hitting it dead on.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
It's an interesting thing.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
I'd like to hear people's feedback too.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.000
Yeah, go ahead.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.000
So Chris, did you see Project Soli up a few weeks ago?

29:31.000 --> 29:32.000
No, what is this?

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Hang on a second.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.000
I shall post it in the chat room.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Project Solia?

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
What was it?

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
It's a Google project.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.000
Oh, oh, oh.

29:42.000 --> 29:53.000
And when I was talking about new and interesting ways to interact with your computer, this is kind of, well, it's just amazeballs.

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
Yeah, I think I did actually see this.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Yeah, yes.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
In fact, I covered this in Tech Talk, I believe.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Right.

30:01.000 --> 30:18.000
It's like using radar to find user interaction controls and things of that nature.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
I love this action.

30:19.000 --> 30:25.000
I'm going to play this because this is so fascinating.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
I'm doing it on Linux.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Oh yeah, we covered this in last.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
That's why I know this.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
This was our Runs Linux.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.000
So look at this.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.000
Check this out, by the way.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
They're doing these on MacBooks running Ubuntu.

30:35.000 --> 30:42.000
And so they have these tiny, tiny devices that are emitting radar and they're tracking finger movements.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
And what I love about this is you know it's going to work.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
Oh, that one there is a ThinkPad.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
You know it's going to work because they're doing the development under Linux.

30:50.000 --> 30:57.000
To track cars, big objects, satellites and planes, we're using them to track micro motions,

30:57.000 --> 31:02.000
twitches of human hands, and then use that to interact with wearables and internet of things.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Now look at this.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.000
And what's great is you get tactile feedback because your fingers are real.

31:08.000 --> 31:13.000
Our team is focused on taking radar hardware and turning it into a gesture sensor.

31:13.000 --> 31:18.000
Radar is a technology which transmits a radio wave towards a target,

31:18.000 --> 31:23.000
and then the receiver of the radar intercepts the reflected energy from that target.

31:23.000 --> 31:28.000
The reason why we're able to interpret so much from this one radar signal

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
is because of the full gesture recognition pipeline that we've built.

31:32.000 --> 31:37.000
The various stages of this pipeline are designed to extract specific gesture information

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
from this one radar signal that we receive at a high frame rate.

31:43.000 --> 31:49.000
From these strange foreign range Doppler signals, we're actually interpreting human intent.

31:49.000 --> 31:55.000
Radar has some unique properties when compared to cameras, for example.

31:55.000 --> 32:01.000
It has very high positional accuracy, which means that you can sense the tiniest motions.

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
We arrived at this idea of virtual tools because we recognize that there's certain archetypes of controls.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
Look at that.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Like a volume knob or a physical slider.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Look at that. Look at that.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
Imagine a button between your thumb and your index finger.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
And the button's not there.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
But pressing this is a very clear action,

32:22.000 --> 32:26.000
and there's a natural physical haptic feedback that occurs as you perform that action.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
The hand can both embody that virtual tool,

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
and it can also be acting on that virtual tool at the same time.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
So if we can recognize that action,

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
we have an interesting direction for interacting with technology.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.000
Now that is a type of interaction that I think makes a lot of sense

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
on a laptop or on a desktop.

32:47.000 --> 32:51.000
Imagine just having that built into the casing of the laptop or a keyboard,

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
so there would just be another input method that's included in that device.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
Yeah, I want that.

32:57.000 --> 33:02.000
That's exactly the kind of input method I think that I would love to see come to the desktop.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Or laptop.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
Or phones, even, I suppose.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.000
Or TVs, even.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
I think, yeah, or, you know, equipment.

33:10.000 --> 33:16.000
You know, your, I'm going to sound old, DVD player, Blu-ray player, amplifier.

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
You know, instead of having great big ugly knobs on things.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.000
Huge for VR.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
This could be huge for VR.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Wow.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
Man.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
That is so cool.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
I hope Google really, I hope that comes to market.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
You know, sometimes these companies have amazing things in the skunk labs that never make it out.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.000
I hope that one makes it out.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
That's a cool one.

33:37.000 --> 33:42.000
All right, well we actually have another really cool project that really tugs on my heartstrings

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
that I want to talk about.

33:43.000 --> 33:48.000
And I think actually it could be something you could host on a DigitalOcean droplet.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
So let's start there.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.000
Let's talk about DigitalOcean, our first sponsor this week.

33:52.000 --> 33:57.000
And I just want to tell you up front, if you know about DigitalOcean, grab our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
You'll get a $10 credit.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.000
You can try out DigitalOcean for a couple of months for totally free.

34:01.000 --> 34:02.000
No credit card required.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
Now, if you're not familiar with DigitalOcean, they've made some news this week.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.000
It's actually pretty cool.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
We were talking about DockerCon, right?

34:09.000 --> 34:18.000
Well, up on stage, they were doing demonstrations of deploying lots of instances of machines with Docker,

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
you know, taking Docker on those machines and then just pushing a container to them.

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
And so he's like, well, the guy is up on stage.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
He's like, so here's my script.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.000
And he starts it up.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.000
And I'm going to go into, you know, it's like a Linux machine that he's creating.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
And he creates the machine.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
And now I'm just going to go ahead and deploy it on DigitalOcean.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
As soon as he says DigitalOcean, everybody in the audience started clapping.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
DigitalOcean got a freaking round of applause at DockerCon.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
How cool is that?

34:41.000 --> 34:44.000
So he deploys it up to DigitalOcean.

34:44.000 --> 34:49.000
And then he spins up like eight, nine, 10, 11 machines all at once up on DigitalOcean.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
And then the containers get deployed up there.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
And then, bam, they just start spinning.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
It was a really cool demo.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
And I was like, wow, that is the incredible power of DigitalOcean.

34:56.000 --> 34:59.000
And what's so neat about that is that's on the high end, right?

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
But you can do anything on DigitalOcean.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
Even if you're just like doing it for testing or your own personal system, like an own cloud

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
server or a Minecraft server, DigitalOcean will work for you too.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
You can get started in less than 55 seconds.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
And pricing plans start only $5 a month.

35:14.000 --> 35:20.000
That'll get you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

35:20.000 --> 35:23.000
And they have data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam.

35:23.000 --> 35:27.000
And DigitalOcean just set up a brand new one up in Germany that is nice.

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
40 gigabit E connections to each hypervisor.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Their fastest SSDs yet.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
And that Germany location has really, really good distribution.

35:36.000 --> 35:42.000
So if you are doing some self-hosting, if you are maybe, again, if you have a podcast,

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
if you have 10, 15,000 listeners, you could host this up on a few DigitalOcean droplets

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
and you are done.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
It is a very elegant solution.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
I used to do something similar to this.

35:52.000 --> 35:57.000
What we had is a little PHP script that when the users hit that, it would randomize which,

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
at the time, it was a different provider, which server it would pull the file off of

36:00.000 --> 36:01.000
and then deliver it.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
Later on, we had to move on to a different system.

36:03.000 --> 36:08.000
But DigitalOcean now, with a terabyte of transfer and $5 a month, there are so many things you can do with it.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
And the great part is their interface to manage all of it is amazing.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
It is super intuitive and power.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.000
You are just going to replicate that control panel on a larger scale with their awesome API,

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
like they were showing at DockerCon.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
And that is where you can do your DNS management.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
Take care of your snapshots.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
One click.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Yeah, I said one click.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Yeah, I meant one click.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
I am not talking like one click SUSE style where it is actually like 15 clicks.

36:29.000 --> 36:35.000
I am talking one click DigitalOcean style where one click and you deploy the entire LAMP stack on an Ubuntu rig

36:35.000 --> 36:40.000
already set up or an Ubuntu Fortune 04 machine with Docker ready to go or a Fedora rig.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
They got all of it.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
It is really cool.

36:42.000 --> 36:46.000
Oh, and by the way, DigitalOcean recently just launched shared resources.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I mean team accounts.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
That way you can share resources and not passwords.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
Team accounts, yeah, that is going to be nice here at Jupiter Broadcasting.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
I think that is a smart move by DigitalOcean.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
Go check them out.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Get started in less than 55 seconds.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
SSD, everything.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
And use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.000
Get a $10 credit.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
Try out a DigitalOcean rig, that $5 one, two months for absolutely free.

37:07.000 --> 37:13.000
By the way, they have got CoreOS now which is a super cool up and coming distribution on servers

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
that you might want to get just for two months.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
Go play with it on some actual production systems.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Why not?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
Also, they have free BSD.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.000
I am not sure why you would do that, but I am sure you probably have reasons.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
DigitalOcean.com.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

37:24.000 --> 37:30.000
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

37:30.000 --> 37:38.000
Alright, well MrBlackout24 in the Linux Action Show subreddit submitted this Butter Knife link.

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
Butter Knife, deploy a customized Linux to hundreds of machines in minutes.

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
Now you can probably guess why they call it Butter Knife because yes, my friends, it involves ButterFS.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.000
Check this out.

37:49.000 --> 37:56.000
A Butter Knife makes bare metal Linux deployment dead simple using the ButterFS file system and containers.

37:56.000 --> 37:59.000
Yeah, how fancy and buzzword can we get?

37:59.000 --> 38:05.000
Let's take a whole bunch of new stuff, put it all together, and get yourself a new deployment system, my friends.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.000
So you prepare a template of a customized OS in an LXC container.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
Brilliant.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
So you customize your rig up in a Linux container.

38:14.000 --> 38:17.000
You brute the provisioned image and deploy a template on bare metal.

38:17.000 --> 38:20.000
And then you just set it up and it's done.

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
So I have a walkthrough that Blackout24 linked us to.

38:24.000 --> 38:28.000
It is literally you pull down the Butter Knife ISO.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.000
You know, take care of that.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
You DD it as you would.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
You set up a TFTP server using the Butter Knife provisioned image on your LAN.

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
You replicate your GitHub repository to the TFTP root server.

38:39.000 --> 38:43.000
You boot the machine either from Pixy or a memory stick or CD.

38:43.000 --> 38:48.000
Once it boots off Pixy, it detects the Butter Knife server.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
And then it says, do you want to provision this machine?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
Do you want to reboot this machine and power it off?

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
You obviously say, provision this machine.

38:54.000 --> 39:06.000
Then Butter Knife wipes the disk, creates a ButterFS file system, downloads the snapshot of the newly created file system on that Linux container you set up, and blasts it onto the machine.

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
And you can do this to deploy live CDs or to a memory stick as well.

39:10.000 --> 39:20.000
And it's all just right here on this blog right here that Blackout24 linked to us with images to kind of do this instead of try it yourself ready to go.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.000
This is really cool.

39:21.000 --> 39:33.000
So if you've got like a LAN or if you have some virtual machines and, you know, you just need to be able to blast a machine, a standardized machine out to them, this makes it like a four or five step process once you have this set up.

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
You've got to use ButterFS and you've got to use Linux containers.

39:37.000 --> 39:47.000
But this Butter Knife system makes it really, really, really easy to go into a container, set up a basic system, and then you can provision that to all your machines.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
Really cool.

39:48.000 --> 39:52.000
So I wanted to say a special thank you to Mr. Blackout.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
Now, with that said, so that's a fancy way to do it.

39:55.000 --> 40:00.000
Wimpy, I'm wondering, do you have any tricks or methods for like reloading your systems?

40:00.000 --> 40:06.000
Do you have like an image you do at home or when you need to reload, do you just format and deploy?

40:06.000 --> 40:18.000
Right. So when I install the system, I install off the Ubuntu Mate ISO image, depending on the architecture of the machine or it's a Raspberry Pi.

40:18.000 --> 40:24.000
But the trick that I have is that I use SyncThing now.

40:24.000 --> 40:31.000
So SyncThing, I have my profile stored in SyncThing.

40:31.000 --> 40:35.000
So the first thing I do on the new machine is install SyncThing.

40:35.000 --> 40:38.000
You mean like your BAS profile or what do you mean profile?

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
Well, yeah, as in all of all of my profiles.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
So all your dot folders?

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
All my dot files, dot folders.

40:45.000 --> 40:50.000
So there's a utility I use. I'll look up the details and post it in the chat room in a bit.

40:50.000 --> 40:54.000
It's called Macup, M-A-C-K-U-P.

40:54.000 --> 41:03.000
And it was originally developed for Apple Mac users to backup their dot files and what have you to Dropbox.

41:03.000 --> 41:08.000
And I contributed some initial ports for Linux.

41:08.000 --> 41:13.000
And since the initial, it was all geared toward Dropbox back when it first started.

41:13.000 --> 41:18.000
But now it's got just any directory you can use as the storage.

41:18.000 --> 41:26.000
So I just have a SyncThing directory and it does all of the, you know, the SIM linking magic.

41:26.000 --> 41:39.000
So you just restore your SyncThing profile directory and then in there I run a Macup restore and then it lays down all of the profiles for me.

41:39.000 --> 41:46.000
So literally within a minute of installing the machine, I've got all of my configuration that I need in place.

41:46.000 --> 41:54.000
Do you run into any issues with version differences or is the key to this approach you reload the same version of the desktop environment,

41:54.000 --> 41:59.000
the same Chrome or Firefox? Do you have to manage it in any kind of special way like that?

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
I haven't been very careful about it, no.

42:01.000 --> 42:10.000
I mean, mostly I'm running Ubuntu MATE 1504 and Arch Linux and they're all up to date enough that I've not run into any problems.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
Interesting.

42:11.000 --> 42:15.000
But when you use Macup, you can, you know, augment things.

42:15.000 --> 42:20.000
You don't have to, it will prompt you and say, do you want to restore this thing?

42:20.000 --> 42:27.000
So I do know, for example, that my Bash profile and Arch Linux, I don't want to have common between Ubuntu and Arch.

42:27.000 --> 42:30.000
So I don't, you know, restore that on the Arch machine.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.000
Gotcha. So that is some management, but yeah.

42:33.000 --> 42:39.000
Yeah, but it prompts me for that because it knows there's already a Bash profile there that's different.

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
And the other thing that I've, yeah, yeah, yeah, I've had some good success with SyncThing.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
I've just started using it a bit more aggressively now.

42:47.000 --> 42:58.000
And the other thing that I've been doing recently is that deconf, which is the back end behind G settings, you can dump.

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
It's called deconf and the parameter is dump and there's also deconf load.

43:03.000 --> 43:16.000
So you can dump all or some trees from deconf into text files and then you can deconf load those text files back into your tree.

43:16.000 --> 43:25.000
So I've got a script that just dumps out the bits of the deconf tree that I know are safe and common between my systems.

43:25.000 --> 43:30.000
So things like how I like the file manager configured, how I like the text editor configured.

43:30.000 --> 43:40.000
And then I can, you know, just that's part of my Mac up post restore script actually then, you know, lobs all that back in again.

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
Oh, God. So you're getting like even like your editor config back the way you want it and stuff.

43:45.000 --> 43:50.000
Everything, you know, SSH keys, GPG keys, all of my application settings.

43:50.000 --> 43:58.000
So when I do a restore, I've got my hex chat configuration, which actually connects to my bouncer.

43:58.000 --> 44:05.000
But nevertheless, you know, there's some config there and I've got all my mumble, mumble profiles in there and all of my mumble certificates.

44:05.000 --> 44:12.000
So I run a Mac up restore and on a fresh machine within two minutes, I've got everything I need to get cracking again.

44:12.000 --> 44:19.000
Nice. Now, Sean, you say you do something kind of similar with symlinks and own cloud. Can you describe that to me?

44:19.000 --> 44:29.000
Well, really a lot of it's done manually, but basically you just take and take all your dot folders and throw them into your own cloud sync folder.

44:29.000 --> 44:35.000
And then you just symlink the individual dot folders from your home folder to your own cloud folder.

44:35.000 --> 44:40.000
And then it's just going to keep a hold of it, replicate that on multiple systems if you want to.

44:40.000 --> 44:49.000
Okay. And then when you like launch into a clean install, do you just kind of sort of resymlink the ones you want to restore the config from manually?

44:49.000 --> 44:52.000
Or do you like bash script that? What's your approach there?

44:52.000 --> 44:58.000
I haven't got into the bash scripting part of it yet. I usually just do the same linking manually for the ones that I want to have.

44:58.000 --> 45:03.000
And then that way I can actually have multiple versions and just kind of rename them and change the symlinks that way.

45:03.000 --> 45:10.000
I like that. I mean, what I like about yours is yours is a little more surgical in the sense that you're just going to, you know what I want, X, Y, Z restored.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
What I really like, though, is Wimpy's idea about exporting out decomp settings.

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
Because I knew it could do that. I know it can do that. I just never do that.

45:18.000 --> 45:26.000
And sometimes I tell myself I don't do it because, well, I like to re-experiment and try something new every time I set up.

45:26.000 --> 45:33.000
I want to be free to try something new. But really, I am getting to the point where I kind of always like to have this theme now.

45:33.000 --> 45:37.000
For the most part, at least for like six months at a time, I like to use this theme. I like to use this setup.

45:37.000 --> 45:40.000
So I don't know. I'm slowing down on that a little bit.

45:40.000 --> 45:46.000
So in my Macup profile, I have the dot themes directory and the dot icons directory.

45:46.000 --> 45:47.000
Yeah, of course.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.000
And I just put all of that stuff in there now, and then it's all restored.

45:51.000 --> 45:56.000
And including things like, you know, I use Genie for my development editor.

45:56.000 --> 46:02.000
And all of my Genie profiles and syntax highlighting and themes is all in there as well.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
So I can move from machine to machine now.

46:05.000 --> 46:14.000
And I can take, I even have in SyncThing all of my git checkouts, which sounds crazy because you can just check git in and out.

46:14.000 --> 46:24.000
But I SyncThing all of my checkouts so that if I don't have time to check stuff in on the laptop I was using and I'm upstairs,

46:24.000 --> 46:30.000
I've just got that state of where I got to on that machine, and I can carry on.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
That's interesting.

46:32.000 --> 46:38.000
And Evil Pickles in the chat room is linking GnuSto, a Simulink farm manager,

46:38.000 --> 46:44.000
which takes distinct packages of software and or data located in separate directories on the file system and makes them appear to be installed in the same place.

46:44.000 --> 46:55.000
So that might work with what you're doing, Sean, is you combine GnuSto, S-T-O-W, and I'll add a link to that in the show notes too if I can remember to do that.

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
Wow, the good setup.

46:56.000 --> 47:01.000
Anybody else in the Mumble Room have any kind of sort of backup or reload techniques they want to share before we move on?

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
I feel like mine are all very clunky and caveman.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
No.

47:05.000 --> 47:12.000
Mine's like, Chris reload, Chris install Dropbox, own cloud, BitTorrent sync, and Chrome sync, Chris done.

47:12.000 --> 47:17.000
Mine is not nearly as elegant as Sean's or Wimpy's, and it kind of makes me want to step up my game a little bit.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
All right.

47:18.000 --> 47:24.000
I've got Mac up linked in the show notes, and right now I'm also linking GnuSto, which is the Simulink manager.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
So very good.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.000
Thanks, guys.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
Good stuff.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.000
I think I'm going to reevaluate my approach.

47:31.000 --> 47:37.000
I think I'm going to adopt a – boy, I kind of am tempted to also play with sync thing now.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Thanks, Wimpy.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.000
You're welcome.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
You got my head spinning.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.000
All right.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.000
I want to get into the Opanoid discussion because it really tugs at the heartstrings for me.

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
It's something that I – it's actually kind of funny how I came across this footage.

47:50.000 --> 48:00.000
So I was reviewing all the footage that Noah uploaded from Southeast Linux Fest, and I didn't see this clip because he didn't upload it.

48:00.000 --> 48:11.000
But the rig, like the big broadcast rig, made it back to the studio because our next live event is going to be at LinuxCon in August, I believe, in Seattle.

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
And so he figured, might as well ship it back to the studio so that way it's local.

48:15.000 --> 48:21.000
And so I take the rig out and I shake the hard drive out, and I found this clip that when Noah had a chance to get away from the booth,

48:21.000 --> 48:26.000
he brought the camera with him and sat down and got this really fascinating interview.

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
So I'm going to roll this because it's like newfound footage from self.

48:30.000 --> 48:36.000
But first, I have to tell you about how I've saved $2,000 in the last couple of years, more than that, actually, by switching to Ting.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
What?

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
Yeah, Ting.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

48:40.000 --> 48:44.000
Ting's my mobile service provider, and I am a serious Ting advocate.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.000
What I love about Ting is you only pay for what you use.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
I know.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.000
Wrap your brain around that.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
It's just your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
After that, you're done.

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
Well, there's a flat $6 for the line and the taxes, but there's no like,

48:57.000 --> 49:02.000
I buy X amount of minutes and X amount of messages and X amount of megabytes because I might use them.

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
No, that S is crazy.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
Ting keeps rates simple.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
We don't make you pick a plan.

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
Instead, you just use your phone as you normally would.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
How much you use determines how much you pay each month.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.000
You can have as many devices as you want on one account.

49:15.000 --> 49:20.000
That's good because when you use more, you pay less per minute, message, or megabyte of data.

49:20.000 --> 49:25.000
Your usage plus $6 per active device on your account plus taxes is your monthly bill.

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Simple.

49:26.000 --> 49:30.000
That's what we mean when we say mobile.

49:30.000 --> 49:31.000
That makes sense.

49:31.000 --> 49:34.000
What Kyra left out, too, is they have no hold customer service.

49:34.000 --> 49:39.000
You call them at 1-855-TING-FTW, and a real human answers the phone.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
And when I was talking to them before they even became a sponsor,

49:42.000 --> 49:47.000
we were talking about this particular aspect of their business because the way they operate,

49:47.000 --> 49:52.000
this is where they can invest heavily, is really good customer service, really, really good dashboards,

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
and rolling out new platform features all the time.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
They have mobile apps that integrate with the service.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
This is where Ting totally doubles down.

49:59.000 --> 50:04.000
I love this aspect of it because it's super nice to finally get this high level of treatment from a carrier.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
I was talking to them, like, how do you choose your service reps?

50:07.000 --> 50:10.000
Because you're making a big stink out of this.

50:10.000 --> 50:15.000
They said, well, first, we would do the traditional route because we've done it for some of our other companies

50:15.000 --> 50:20.000
we've set up in the past, but then what we realized was we were really looking for the Android geeks

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
and the Windows Mobile geeks and the iPhone enthusiasts.

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
And when they were there, we would find the people that would always be the tech support of their family

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
or their peer group, and those are the people we wanted to hire.

50:30.000 --> 50:34.000
So that way, when you call in, you're talking to one of the people that love this kind of stuff.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
And that was, I thought, a brilliant insight on Ting's part.

50:37.000 --> 50:43.000
And here's what I love, is right now, for a couple of days left until the end of June,

50:43.000 --> 50:47.000
this is only going to last a couple more days, you can get $50 off your first Ting device

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
or a $50 service credit if you bring your own device.

50:50.000 --> 50:54.000
Ting has GSM and CDMA networks, so there's a lot of devices you can bring.

50:54.000 --> 50:57.000
They have a Bring Your Own Device page to tell you more about that.

50:57.000 --> 51:02.000
$50 is a big deal. Go to linux.ting.com to get that.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.000
That supports the Unplugged show specifically, but it also gets you the $50 credit.

51:06.000 --> 51:11.000
Now, they have MiFi devices, and remember, with Ting's structure, you only pay for what you use.

51:11.000 --> 51:16.000
So you can get $50 of credit if you get one of these MiFi devices.

51:16.000 --> 51:20.000
That might mean that you're not paying for data for months on this thing.

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
You just have tri-band LTE in your pocket when you need it.

51:23.000 --> 51:27.000
That's cool. That's actually very useful, too.

51:27.000 --> 51:31.000
They also have feature phones that are great for emergencies,

51:31.000 --> 51:35.000
all the way up to the highest end devices if you want to make it your dedicated line like I do.

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
It's a really great service, and they have really good people working at Ting.

51:39.000 --> 51:43.000
Go to linux.ting.com and take advantage of that $50 discount while it lasts.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
It expires at the end of June.

51:45.000 --> 51:50.000
Linux.ting.com, and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
You guys are awesome. I love, love, love my Ting service.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
And now I'm on the GSM network, too, which is even more awesome.

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
So, let's talk about Opanoid.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Their slogan is, we make systems work.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
Networks and systems enable every business operating today.

52:04.000 --> 52:09.000
We keep them running and make enterprise-level features available to small and medium-sized organizations.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
All right. That's a pretty badass pitch.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.000
And at first, I was like, okay, that sounds kind of like what I always hear.

52:14.000 --> 52:20.000
But Noah was wandering the floors like a madman at Southeast Linux Fest a couple of weeks ago.

52:20.000 --> 52:24.000
And like I said, I found this clip with Jim from Opanoid,

52:24.000 --> 52:28.000
and the sys admin in me immediately fell in love, and I wanted to share it with you guys.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
So, here we go.

52:29.000 --> 52:35.000
Welcome. We're here at CELF 2015, and walking around again like last year, the year before.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
Not many Macs, not many Windows PCs, but a lot of Linux.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
I ran into Jim and met Jim last year.

52:41.000 --> 52:46.000
Now, you remember me from inside of the room, but I actually don't recall this story,

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
so you'll have to refresh my memory.

52:48.000 --> 52:54.000
So, basically, Ryan Gordon, aka Ikyulus, he did a presentation on his Macbook,

52:54.000 --> 52:59.000
and he couldn't figure out how to get it to connect to the projector.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
And when I walked into the speaker sponsor lounge a little bit later,

53:02.000 --> 53:08.000
you were in there having a conversation with somebody very, very vehement about people who brought Macs to conferences,

53:08.000 --> 53:13.000
which I kind of have an issue with that, too, but I try to be a little bit more political about it.

53:13.000 --> 53:18.000
But you were just letting it rip, and Ryan walked in in the middle of your tirade,

53:18.000 --> 53:25.000
and you didn't recognize him or realize that he was the guy that had flubbed the presentation on the Macbook.

53:25.000 --> 53:29.000
And he tried to say a couple of things in defense of bringing a Mac to an open source conference,

53:29.000 --> 53:34.000
and you just pretty much ripped his head off and pooped down his neck.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
I tend to do that from time to time.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
It was wrong, but hilarious.

53:38.000 --> 53:42.000
All right. Well, I have no recollection of that, but it's an amusing story nonetheless.

53:42.000 --> 53:50.000
Now, you're here ripping Windows off of hardware and putting it on top of a virtualization system

53:50.000 --> 53:55.000
to get so that you and I as system administrators, we just deal with the underlying OS of Linux,

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
and Windows just kind of sits on top.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
That's something we can both get by, right?

54:00.000 --> 54:01.000
Absolutely.

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
So tell me what it is I'm looking at here.

54:03.000 --> 54:06.000
And actually what I might do is I might reposition the camera to look at the screen,

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
because you have actually kind of an interesting demo going on.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
Okay. Great.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
Now, don't get sick.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
He's going to move the – okay. All right.

54:14.000 --> 54:18.000
Now, OpenOID, Open Source Systems Intelligence, that's cool. I like that.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
Okay. So we're looking at a Sanoid machine right here.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
We're actually looking at – we've got two machines in a rack,

54:24.000 --> 54:27.000
and you can see we're connected to both of them in Vert Manager right here.

54:27.000 --> 54:31.000
The one on the top that I'm wiggling around in, this is the production machine,

54:31.000 --> 54:34.000
and the bottom machine on the rack is backup.

54:34.000 --> 54:38.000
And at the base of everything, this is a virtualization platform.

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
And we have Windows Server 2012 R2 virtualized on the platform,

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
and we're looking right here at a Server 2012 VM.

54:45.000 --> 54:51.000
The idea behind this platform is we're condensing an entire enterprise virtualization stack

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
with a SAN and a 10 gig fiber transport network and separate compute nodes and all that

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
into a single commodity box running open source software.

54:59.000 --> 55:04.000
And one of the things, when you tell somebody that, the first thing they think is, well,

55:04.000 --> 55:07.000
it must be cheap and the performance must be, you know, not as good.

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
That's actually not the case.

55:09.000 --> 55:13.000
One of the things that we all love to hate about Windows is having to reboot it constantly.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.000
It's very painful.

55:14.000 --> 55:18.000
So let's reboot it.

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
And that's really not so bad.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
We just rebooted Windows in about a second and a half.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.000
So obviously performance is not an issue here.

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
But that's actually the least important thing about this.

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
Much more important is if we drop to the console here,

55:31.000 --> 55:36.000
we can see that we're actually looking at a stream of hourly, daily, and monthly snapshots.

55:36.000 --> 55:43.000
Sanoid automatically snapshots all the VMs every hour on the hour and on daily and monthly as well.

55:43.000 --> 55:46.000
Keeps them, thins them, rotates them out as needed.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
You don't have to have any hands-on interaction with it.

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
It just does it all for you.

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
And it also replicates.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
If you look down here, this is our backup box.

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
And you can see we've got the exact same stream of snapshots here on both machines.

55:58.000 --> 56:04.000
So what that means is if you're concerned about, you know, are my offsite backups any good or not,

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
it's actually very easy to find out.

56:06.000 --> 56:13.000
Just boot it up and see.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
So that was pretty easy, and we know that our offsite backup is good.

56:17.000 --> 56:24.000
If we're still not convinced, we can actually just log into it

56:24.000 --> 56:28.000
and interact with it however we need to to actually demonstrate things going on.

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
Now if you've got sharp eyes, you might have noticed that we've got a shutdown event tracker here.

56:32.000 --> 56:38.000
And the reason for that is that the replication is actually crash consistent, not application consistent.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
I consider that to be a feature, not a bug.

56:40.000 --> 56:46.000
So unlike Microsoft's volume shadow copies, there's no services that are forced to kies the system before it's replicated.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
It just gets replicated no matter what.

56:49.000 --> 56:53.000
So you can't end up with having like a writer get locked up and you don't get your replications.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Nobody wants that.

56:55.000 --> 57:01.000
Now the other thing that I like to do is to look at, you know, what do we do if something goes wrong.

57:01.000 --> 57:05.000
So in here, back in our console, we're looking at this 13 gigs.

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
That's actually the storage for our Windows 2012 R2 production box.

57:09.000 --> 57:12.000
Well, we hate it.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
It's gone.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
We killed it.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
And we can prove that.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
We'll force it off.

57:19.000 --> 57:25.000
And if we try to start it, you can see we get an error, of course, because we nuked the entire hard drive.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
Oh no, what do we do?

57:27.000 --> 57:39.000
Well, all we do is just look at our available snapshots.

57:39.000 --> 57:44.000
And we'll go to our most recent hourly, which was only taken a few minutes ago.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
So we do a rollback.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.000
It's that quick, that easy.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
That was literally all there was to it.

57:48.000 --> 57:52.000
And we're done.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.000
Everything's fixed.

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
So imagine instead of me just arbitrarily deleting the hard drive that had been a user,

57:57.000 --> 58:03.000
if you are a sys admin who has to deal with Windows and its users, who clicked the wrong link in email

58:03.000 --> 58:07.000
and managed to crypto wall your server up, your recovery is, again, just that easy.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
There's no going to tapes or any of all that craziness.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
You just do a rollback to your most recent hourly, and you're up in seconds.

58:14.000 --> 58:24.000
Now, this is one of those things that I would imagine makes your life as a system administrator way easier.

58:24.000 --> 58:30.000
And I actually am a huge advocate of Liberty and KVM and, of course, Vert Manager,

58:30.000 --> 58:36.000
because the nice thing is it allows me to access all of my client servers from my laptop through SSH

58:36.000 --> 58:39.000
and everything from top to bottom is Linux.

58:39.000 --> 58:44.000
But you have gone one step further, and you're actually building these as a hardware solution for your clients.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
Absolutely.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Okay, so tell me about that.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
If I wanted to buy, like, let's say maybe I'm not very technically savvy,

58:50.000 --> 58:54.000
you will actually build the system out for somebody and send it out,

58:54.000 --> 58:57.000
and then they just plug it in and you'll manage it for them?

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
That's correct.

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
There are three base models, a small business edition, a standard, and a pro,

59:03.000 --> 59:08.000
which differ in how much CPU, RAM, and storage they can handle.

59:08.000 --> 59:11.000
They sell for a set price without storage.

59:11.000 --> 59:16.000
You can either add storage yourself, or I can also supply them to you with the storage installed.

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
And basically, when you get the box, it's already set up, ready to go.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
All you have to do is add VMs.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
Outstanding.

59:22.000 --> 59:28.000
And if people wanted to go learn more information about your consulting service or your build service, where would they go?

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Opanoid.net.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
Outstanding.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
Thanks so much for taking the time, Jim, to speak with us.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
We really appreciate it.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
Thank you.

59:34.000 --> 59:35.000
Really cool.

59:35.000 --> 59:39.000
And I have linked in the show notes, too, a link to the code.

59:39.000 --> 59:45.000
The policy-driven snapshot management replication tools are now currently using ZFS, or ZFS as you Yanks call it,

59:45.000 --> 59:49.000
for underlying next-gen storage with explicit plans to support ButterFS.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.000
There you go, Sean.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
When ButterFS becomes more reliable.

59:52.000 --> 59:55.000
So, Sean, I saw you say in the chat, I'm like, ah, I can do this with ButterFS.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.000
Go ahead.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
Get it in there.

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
Get it in there.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.000
I'll let you.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Well, you know, it's already got it.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Snapshots.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
It's there.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Yeah, but this is a really cool, like, full front-end UI management tool that I remember

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
back when I was managing a whole bunch of Linux VMs.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.000
We didn't quite have anything like this yet, and it was becoming – I started – okay.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000
I don't know if anybody in the chat room remembers Red Carpet.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Does anybody remember a service called Red Carpet that was like a patch management system for Linux?

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Yep.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Oh, you do?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Oh, Wimpy, can you describe it?

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Because I'm not – I don't remember it very well.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I was just Googling it.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
No, I just remember it from eons ago.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
I don't think I ever used it in anger.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
So I'm trying to remember –

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Was it not – was it not for Red Hat specifically?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Yeah, and also it worked with SUSE for a bit.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Yeah, Red Carpet was the package management system for – from the Zeminian desktop.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Zeminian, and therefore Red Carpet is now owned by Novell.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Red Carpet supports most of the popular Linux distributions.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
It later tended to the Zenworks – oh, man, Zenworks.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I did Zenworks management too.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Oh, man, I remember Zenworks.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
This is one of the reasons I switched to SUSE Enterprise Linux.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And oh, man, Zeminian.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Do you remember Zeminian?

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
They were the ones that – actually that's where we got Nautilus from.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
They were called Helix Code –

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
And Evolution.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
And what?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Evolution.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Yeah, the Evolution mail client.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Mail client, yeah.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Right, yeah.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
And it says actually where Zemarian eventually came out of, where Mono eventually came out of,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
and Miguel did all of this.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:33.000
I mean, this company eventually evolved into Zemarian.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Wow, a lot of history just all of a sudden hit me in the face.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000
And I used a lot of different tools.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Red Carpet was the first one I ever used, and I loved it because it was a GTK GUI desktop interface,

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:52.000
and it used SSH and remote – I can't remember what – oh, yeah, a little client server system for Red Carpet.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
So you had to have like a distribution that was supported and had a package available for Red Carpet.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000
But once you did that, from one spot I could uninstall packages, I could install updates for all of the distributions,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
one GTK app on my desktop.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000
For like six months I was in patch management utopia.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Eventually Red Carpet went away, and I couldn't keep up with the pace of development of distributions.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
This was an early lesson for me.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.000
And then I tried something called Zenworks, which was horrible because it was so complicated,

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
and it just sort of spun out and spun out.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:32.000
So now when I see things like Opanoid or like Butter Knife that we talked about earlier in the show,

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:41.000
and honestly things like DigitalOcean, I just think it's a new era that makes Linux accessible to just a whole new group of people

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
that can deploy these really big systems now and manage them.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
And like Sean likes to point out, ButterFS is going to be part of that, too.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
I just get a little excited when I see it.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
That was a little nostalgic.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Ximarian and Ximian, boy, that really takes me back.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:03.000
All right, so you guys know fairly publicly here on the show, I've talked about how I'm a big Chrome and Chromium user.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I actually prefer to use Chrome since the Netflix stuff, but I guess now I can do that under Chromium.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:15.000
And thanks to a bug, I believe this is how it started, and I'll open myself up to correction here in a moment.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000
But I believe thanks to a bug discovered by someone in the Debian project,

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000
we now know that Chromium, if you install Chromium, like on Ubuntu or Debian and perhaps other places,

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000
once it launches, it downloads a binary in the background that enables your microphone.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000
So that way you can do things like, OK, Charlie.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I don't want to activate your phone, but you know what it does.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
OK, Charlie, what's the weather like today?

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
And then Charlie, a.k.a. Google, comes back and tells you what the weather's like.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
And this is a search function built into Chrome browser you can turn on and off, and now they've been enabling this.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.000
But people get freaked out.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I install the Chromium browser and it downloads this binary.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And the more I thought about it, the more I realized this actually might be a really big deal because, wait a minute,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:59.000
what if it's not even – what if you just remove what the binary does,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:06.000
not even the fact that it activates the microphone and the fact that they're doing it secretly in the background without user permission?

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
That, I think, is what gets me.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
You say it could be doing anything.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
It could be enabling GPU acceleration.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
It could be enabling a faster write to my SSD.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000
But if they're downloading it in the background without my permission and installing it, right there, right there,

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
that seems like where the line gets crossed, right there.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Where it gets into absolutely egregious territory is when that binary turns on my microphone.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Because before I give them permission to do that, I would like to know what controls that list.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Can other things be added to the OK Google list?

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Can hundreds of words be added to that list?

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Can nothing be added to that list?

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Is it an encrypted list?

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Is it editable if I dig around in Chrome settings?

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
How is that managed?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
What activates that trigger?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Before that question is answered, I don't want to install it on my browser.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000
And if they don't even give me the option they just do in the background, that's egregious.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
So is this the line?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Or are we the boiling frogs that are going to sit here and say, no, it's not a big deal.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
It's just not a problem.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
It's not a big deal.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
So I want to talk about that with a moment.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
But first, I want to talk about Linux Academy.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
I love Linux Academy because I see a lot of what inspires me in them.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
People that are truly passionate about Linux and open source and about the community

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
coming together to create something that they think they're going to love.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
That's what really Linux Academy is about, is true enthusiasts in Linux and open source

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
coming together with developers and educators, creating the Linux Academy platform.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Seven plus Linux distributions you get to choose from for any of the courseware that they have.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Then that automatically defines the VPS that they're going to spin up for you on demand

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
when the courseware requires that, which is really cool because that means you're actually

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
SSHing into a server, you're installing these things, you're configuring these things,

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
and you're checking for real world results.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
That means when you go do this in production, it's not the first time you've messed with this stuff.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
It's not just concept.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
That closes the gap.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
That goes from uncanny valley knowledge to you actually know what you're doing.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
And I really like that it's self-paced courses.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And this comes through in a lot of ways.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
From your availability selectors where you say, I'm available for one hour on Monday,

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
one hour on Wednesday, and three hours on Sunday.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
And then it just automatically generates you some courseware.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
That's also really great.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.000
But they have over 1,549, I think that number's even gone up since they've updated these videos,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.000
that you can go through and watch entire courses on.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
That is some serious content, let me tell you.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
I know what it takes to produce that many videos.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
And they have scenario-based labs where you really work with common tasks in an everyday environment.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.000
In these advanced labs environments, you'll complete these scenarios from beginning to end on live servers.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
That's extremely handy.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
They have great new courseware for the Red Hat course stuff.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
They have the best OpenStack, the best Docker materials.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:46.000
They have stuff for Ruby, Python, PHP, Android development, basic Linux courseware, IP tables.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000
In fact, if you just need to refresh a few skills, check out their nuggets.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I love this.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
They're always adding new nuggets all the time.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Like they have some up here for AWS.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000
So if you're working with the Amazon Web Services, here's how to create a snapshot bash backup script.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Some virtual box nuggets.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Building a firewall with IP tables.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
This is really cool because these nuggets last anywhere from six minutes to, I don't know, an hour.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000
And it's just a single topic.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
You go in there, you deep dive on this topic, you get more efficient on that topic, and you're done.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
This is another way you get value out of Linux Academy.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000
And a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged show, you guys.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Keep up the great work.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Okay, so anybody want to jump in first on this Chrome topic?

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
To me it seems like this is the line too far.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
And here's, I already told this story so I'll keep it brief, but here's what made me realize this.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:04.000
It was Father's Day.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I was seeing family.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000
And this family, it was a couple, they have two Samsung S4 phones.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
You know, a couple years old now because the S6 is out, right?

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
And before they installed this update they got, they wanted to come see me.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
So I look at their update, oh it's Lollipop.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Oh good, you guys are going to get Lollipop.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Great, great.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Yeah, this is a good update.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
You're really going to like Lollipop.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Let's do it.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Let's install it.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
So we plug in their chargers, we hit the update.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:33.000
It takes like an hour because it's got to update all their apps too.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
It says it's going to take 30 minutes.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
It does not take 30 minutes.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And it updates all their apps.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Well one of the new apps it gives them is Google Photos.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Oh okay, Google Photos.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
All right, cool.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
So I'm showing them, well I've got Google Photos on my phone.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Let me show it to you.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
And I bust it down.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
I'm like this right here is Google Photos and it is so great.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000
I do not have time to tag and organize my photos and I don't ever manage it.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
And this just automatically backs them up to Google servers for me and unlimited storage.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000
And I'm just going into the whole thing, talking about how great it is.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
And look at this I say.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
And I bust out the search feature and I'm like it's tagged every person's face.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000
And look, it knows this is food, these are flowers, that's an object, that's a car, that's

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
a whatever, a holiday.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Like it's gone through and figured all this stuff out.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
And I'm like so check this out.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.000
And I hit the search button and I say show me all the pictures of my son Dylan at Christmas.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
And I'm like and check this out.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I've never tagged any of these photos.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:29.000
And the Google Photos app instantaneously auto populates the search results.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Here's all the pictures with Dylan at Christmas.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
And I'm like isn't that awesome?

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Isn't that great?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I never told it this is Christmas.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
I never told it this is Dylan.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.000
It just figured all that out by importing my pictures.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000
And they look at me like I am a crazy person.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Like they look at me like so how does it know that's Dylan?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000
And I'm like well it looks at the face.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
So it knows the faces of everybody you take pictures of?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Yeah.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
So it knows everybody you ever hang out with that's in your photos?

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Yeah.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000
And I won't say this guy.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Let's just call him Jim.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
And they say to me they say well what about your buddy Jim?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.000
He intentionally like it's his mission in life never to have a presence online.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
He never wants to be tagged in any photos.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000
He doesn't have a Facebook profile.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
He doesn't have a Twitter account.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
He doesn't have a Google account.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Like what about him?

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000
What about Jim?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
He's in some of your photos.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
I'm like oh yeah Jim is in some of my photos.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Like so now Google knows that you hang out with Jim even though Jim never wants to be online.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Yeah I guess.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
And so I expected them to be like oh man this is going to be so convenient.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Now I don't have to worry about managing my photos and I don't have to worry about losing my photos when I get rid of my phone.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.000
But because they had never been introduced and this is my now this is my theory.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Because they had not really been introduced to some of this Google stuff.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:52.000
They just were kind of all of a sudden thrown in on the deep end on one of the more kind of creepier things Google can do.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
And they weren't sort of slowly introduced to it.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000
They didn't see it like be introduced through Google Plus and slowly develop with auto awesome features getting rolled out.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000
And like they didn't see the whole evolution of it.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
They just kind of went in boom.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000
And they're like whoa this is way too and now they're not going to use it.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:20.000
And then I thought could I could you imagine if I told them that their Google Web browser was automatically downloading a program in the background that turns on their microphone so that time.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
So that way they can say OK Google.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
What's the weather like.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000
They would think I'm a crazy person.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000
So when I think about it through their perspective I think gosh maybe this is gone way too far.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Maybe we are sitting here in the boiling pot just.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:41.000
That's good you know they mean well there's just one more thing right but hey they fixed it right now you can opt out.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:45.000
So it's just no big deal and we just keep on going.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
One more thing one more.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:54.000
But every now and then I have like these reality checks where I talk to people outside the tech bubble and I expect them to be like oh man that's great.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And they're like whoa are you OK with that.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Does Jim know you've done that.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000
And I'm like oh and I felt like she's like I didn't really think about that.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I had thought about it but I didn't really really really wrap my head around it.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
And then this thing happens.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
So what do you think.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Is this the line too far.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Sean I want to start with you.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Go ahead.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Well bottom line is anything that can compromise my privacy.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I want to be asked first before you add it to my stuff.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Good point.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
North Ranger what do you think.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I don't think we should be surprised because we've seen this before with Android replacing gallery apps camera apps with the closed source.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Google versions.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Well and that's actually what I was going to ask.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
And the value of this is negative.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Is this once again RMS being right or are we overreacting.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Is this what we get for using a proprietary browser by a advertising company that wants to make life more convenient.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000
But Chromium is not a proprietary application is it.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
No but it still happened didn't it.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Yeah and so it probably happened because this is how Chrome is packaged how Chromium is packaged because the two are very closely related.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:14.000
But the question here is is who is the package maintainer.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Because if you're using a Linux distribution ultimately you're placing your trust in the person that makes the binary packages that you install on your system.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Because as I said earlier for a brief moment for example I'm a maintainer for Debian and for Arch Linux.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000
So for a brief moment I have root on your system.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000
And the question is do you trust me.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000
And there are a lot of people out there that are in that position.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Yeah so you know there are processes in place with the distributions and they do things a little bit differently.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:06.000
I think Debian is far more rigorous than some of the other distributions in terms of the checks and balances that are in place to ensure that the packages are of a suitable quality and they don't do anything you know untoward.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:19.000
But yeah you take any distribution and ultimately you have to say to yourself for a moment somebody somewhere created this package and they have root on my system.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.000
That's a sobering thought and I think it's a good perspective for us to take because it is the reality.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And it's when you think of it in that context in that perspective you can see why there are other other solutions being worked on.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:40.000
And this is yeah exactly and this is why things like you know atomic and snappy packages and click packages are becoming a thing.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Because for example on Android when you install an app on your Android phone that app during the install process does not have root.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Hmm very good point.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Yeah OK.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:02.000
In a go go I want to give you a chance to say maybe Jim is a lost cause that him and never having an online presence is not possible in 2015.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Should I not feel so bad.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Well it's kind of not possible because he could have walked past a stop that is sharing its CCTV camera with an app that you can download on the app so that lets you see CCTV cameras.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Sure.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000
That then means he's been online.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:22.000
It is quite hard to avoid cameras nowadays.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Yeah isn't that so true.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:33.000
So here's what I wanted to kind of put out there is maybe a feeler if you go to Linux action show to Reddit dot com find episode 98 feedback thread.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.000
What could I recommend them that they could put on a phone.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Be great if it supported iOS and Android so maybe I could use it myself.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000
That would work for backup.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000
So I tried bit torrent sync.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Yeah it'll copy file program files off our pictures off.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:56.000
But it's it's not the same thing to just copy the data as it is to actually have a little intelligence behind it.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
There's another app out there called picture life.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
This is a private company.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.000
They were recently bought up that does the same thing that Google Photos does privately.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
You pay more for it.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
I don't know.

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I actually forget.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:13.000
I just was looking at it sort of casually and it automatically backups your photos does the face tagging does sort of like location tagging and tracking.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
But it's a separate private company.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
It's not part of an information behemoth.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:27.000
That's kind of appealing but I would really like an open source solution for photo backup something where you know the user can let it run in the background automatically copy the photos off sort of like Google Photos does.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Or bit torrent sync or Dropbox.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Or actually I think I think there's even a way to do with own cloud.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
I haven't.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Yeah OK.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Yeah Mr. Grumpy R says yeah there is a way to do with own cloud.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.000
I haven't really played with that.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000
That might be worth playing with but then see they'd have to have an own cloud server.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Yeah that's a hard one.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000
That is a hard one.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I'm not quite sure what the solution is there.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Dropbox will do it as well as Waffle maker points out.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Now Mini MC did you want to point anything else out before we wrap up on the Chromium topic.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Yeah I did that blog post from Debian.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Yeah it looks like Chromium the Debian part of Chromium comes without native clients module support.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:13.000
So even if that module was downloaded it cannot be executed because there is no NICL interpreter.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Right.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000
But besides that I agree with you.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
They have gone too far.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Yeah that's not it.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
I cannot agree with you.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Yeah I'm really stuck.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
I feel like I'm locked into Chromium actually.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:40.000
And so I implore the internet until I switch to GNOME web fully and links and G edit and all these other programs I'm going to have to like patch together to do what I do with Chromium.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Until that moment comes please internet stay vigilant on this browser.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Keep them on watch for me.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Let's do a neighborhood watch on Chromium because I can't go away.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000
I can't quit using it yet.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I'm hooked.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
I'm on the juice.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
I need to join a program.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
But until then I'm stuck.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I'm stuck.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I need your help because that's how I make these shows.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
There's just some good plug ins there.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
I know people have no WebGL I know and Firefox drives me crazy.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
I'm sorry I love it but it drives me crazy.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000
It is a disaster.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000
All right.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.000
Well if you would have liked to chime in on this conversation you know you absolutely could.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
We have an open mum room.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
We just check your mics before you come on air.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:20.000
We really do consider this our virtual Linux users group.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Come be a part of our vlog if you will.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Head over to jblive.tv on Tuesdays.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000
We do this at 2 p.m.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000
Pacific and go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Also you can email the show go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar or go to the subreddit linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
All right everybody.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Well thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:56.000
We'll see you right here next week for episode 99.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Okay Google.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:25.000
How do I quit you?

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Okay.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
What do we got here?

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Let's see.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
It's got me something.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Google actually has an answer for how do I quit you.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Let's see what it is.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Is it an ad?

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000
You have no idea how bad it gets.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000
What?

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
What is this?

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000
I wish I knew how to quit you.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Wow.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Well thank you.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
That apparently is its answer is a YouTube clip.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000
Well I don't know how to quit you Google.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.000
I need you.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
All right.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
JBtitles.com.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000
Let's go pick our title.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:58.000
JBtitles.com.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Good show guys.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Thanks you.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:01.000
Thanks you.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Wow Wimpy you have a really bad ass backup strategy there.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
I'm not expecting something so crazy cool.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000
I mean I guess I should have.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
It's not it's not complicated.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.000
If you look at that utility it's really simple.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Yeah.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
It's got a little.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:22.000
So it's kind of meta because I use Mac up to back up the Mac up backup rules.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
So it restores itself.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
You know it's quite cool.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Yeah.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Yeah I like it.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000
I got it.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
I managed to grab the link so thank you for posting that.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000
That's a good one.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Maybe I almost I almost want to do a whole episode dedicated to people's backup techniques.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
If we had enough people chiming in that would say they could show up in the mummer room

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
and talk about it.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000
I think I'd be down for that.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000
I'd be down for that.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
All right.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.000
JBtitles.com.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
JBtitles.com.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Man is it hot in the studio today.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Yes.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Yes.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000
I'm not going Alex Jones on on Chrome.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Come on.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
Come on.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
That's a little harsh.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Not OK Google.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.000
That is.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Wow that's good.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000
I'm.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Wow.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000
Wow.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Drawing the line at Google Windows as a second class citizen Mac up your Linux.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.000
But a knife Linux containers out of touch Linux.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Hello.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Hello Mr.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Puppy.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000
You're just in time.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Yeah.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Are we ready to stop.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Yeah.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Yeah.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000
Oh sure.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Should we do it over again.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Let's do it over again.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Spider Oak would be a decent open source location.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.000
The thing that annoys me about Chromium is the fact that they hide that extension.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:30.000
It's an extension.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.000
It's an add on.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.000
It's a feature that gets added into Chromium.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.000
But the fact is that they don't make it visible in the user interface anywhere.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.000
Right.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000
That is that is accessible.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000
They're going to be like in the Chromium 45 right.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Right.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Apparently apparently it was an A and C and A C L plugin.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:50.000
So that's kind of been depreciated now.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
And a go go.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
You got this weird buzz on your line.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Are you coming in over a client.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Are you coming in over an analog connection.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
I think it might be me.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
I might stop talking now.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000
It is you.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.000
I know that.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.000
But it sounds like maybe you have like a little interference on that card or something here.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Not OK Google I think is our.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
God it is hot in here.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
It is so hot in here.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000
All right.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Not OK Google.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000
All right.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Good.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Good.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Well how are you doing Mr. Popey.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Oh sorry Wimpy.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Go ahead.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Yeah.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000
I was just going to say Popey how are you finding the nice cool weather over here at

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000
the moment.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Oh it's delightful.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Oh shut up.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000
It's a lovely evening isn't it.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Very funny.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Now OK.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000
All right.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
So both of you guys are here.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000
I want to pin you down on this.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
This is ridiculous.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000
I don't I don't I don't know if this is a culture difference or what but beer and curry

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000
how does that go.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
How do you do beer and curry.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Like I can understand like beer and like fish and chips or beer and burgers but curry and

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
beer.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000
No.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
All the things you've just listed were wrong.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
It's obviously beer and curry.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Either either you have loads and loads of beer and then you get really hungry at the

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000
end of the night and you go for a curry or you go for a curry early in the evening and

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
then you spend the rest of the night having.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Yeah but then aren't you having like curry beer beer belches like all like the entire

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
evening like you're belching up curry and beer.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Yeah.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Yeah.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Yeah.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.000
And and in the morning your wife gets to wake up to the delightful smell of sort of you

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000
know beer curry farts.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
It's you know it's a it's a it's a beautiful thing.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.000
I'm just I'm just a toilet roll in the fridge for the next day.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Yeah.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Yeah.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Yeah.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.000
And the day after you file for divorce.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Yeah.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Yeah.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
But we're not animals.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
It wasn't all beer and curry.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
We did actually drink a vast quantity of Long Island ice tea before we started on the beer.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Good.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Good.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Oh man.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000
That's it.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000
That's an interesting combo.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
But no that's that's that's the culture here.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
It's some beer then curry or curry then beer.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Or if you're really lucky beer curry and then more beer.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000
How do I.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.000
I just feel like you're pulling my leg right now.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I just feel like you're pulling my leg.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I don't know.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
No no no.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000
No no no.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
No seriously.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
That is honestly.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Yeah.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Yeah.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Yeah.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Yeah.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
Yeah.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Yeah.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Yeah.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Yeah.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Yeah.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Yeah.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Yeah.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
Yeah.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Yeah.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Yeah.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Yeah.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Yeah.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Yeah.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Yeah.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Yeah.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Yeah.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Yeah.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Yeah.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Yeah.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Like it seems like you have a limited selection.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000
So I'm I'm usually like I'm the guy that like is like well these kind of beers go go with

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000
these kind of foods.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Are you drinking any kind of bear or are you drinking specific.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Often if well if it's beforehand then you could drink anything.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.000
OK.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000
OK.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.280
big ones or one of the smaller brands. And what kind of curry is it? It's generally a lager. It's not any curry.

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:33.280
Okay. There's there's so much to choose from. Where we where we went where we went

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:38.360
this weekend it was Indian cuisine and Nepalese cuisine so there was quite a

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:44.520
selection. Noah would be down with that. So I had garlic chili chicken. Oh yeah. Yeah.

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:49.320
All right all right now you got my attention. You know when Noah

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:52.840
comes out here like we like have to at least once or twice go out to Indian

01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:56.960
food and I'm not I'm not joking I've now gone twice and this has been my

01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:03.820
experience each time they totally disregard me and they love Noah and so

01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:08.800
much so that I'm not joking I ordered something and the guy's like no no no I

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:11.560
won't get you that should I get him this instead and Noah's like yeah that'd be

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:16.480
good and he he orders me the guy orders me something else and make sure it's

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:20.680
okay with Noah first doesn't even check with me and changes my order format.

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:26.720
I'm like oh I'm like what? Okay. I never look at the menu in a curry house. I

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:30.040
pretty much never look at the menu. I just ask them yeah what's the best thing you got.

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:34.520
Yeah I learned my lesson. I don't even remember what it was. I don't remember

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:38.320
what it was but you know what oh oh you know I wanted I wanted it I wanted oh

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.680
that's the other thing too. I also wanted what's the flatbread called you

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:45.600
know that flatbread with the garlic on yeah yeah nom yeah it's a nom and so I

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.880
was like you know what I'd also like another piece of nom because I really

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:50.520
like the nom and I don't have like a lot of bread all the time so I'm like I'm

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:55.480
gonna have so I'm gonna go for it and they're like no you don't need it I'm

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:59.640
like but I wanted to eat a lot of it like I wanted to indulge and they're

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:02.360
like no but I didn't say that part but he's like yeah you don't need it okay I

01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:07.840
was gonna pay for it. I have a I have a friend who whenever we used to go out

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:10.720
for curry he would always order a nom and it would always be too much and he

01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:14.160
would always order it anyway because it was a special deal where you know you

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:17.560
get the nom thrown in yeah so he would always order it and then take it home in

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:23.480
a doggie bag and he would then like eat it when he gets home or the next morning

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:29.480
for breakfast it was delicious yeah and although I noticed that we all we all

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:33.840
ordered without rice this weekend and we all just had curry and nom bread yeah

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:38.720
non is so nom I really I was surprised when I had it something about it's like

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:42.160
oh it's just it was delicious so I do kind of like going out to have Indian

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:45.120
food time time but there's not any really near here the studio because the

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:51.000
studio is getting close to hick town and it kind of like the last remnants of

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.200
like civilized hick town so there's no Indian cuisine around here you got to

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.760
travel to 20 miles either direction and then you think then you're up to your

01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:01.800
sack in them but well we got a lot of around this neck of the woods is Chinese
