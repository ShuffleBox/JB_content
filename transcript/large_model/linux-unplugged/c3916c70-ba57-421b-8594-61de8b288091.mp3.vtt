WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.140
Someone here at the barbecue though, he asked like, so do you guys submit bug reports during

00:05.140 --> 00:06.140
your reviews?

00:06.140 --> 00:08.580
Like if you come across a problem, do you submit a bug report?

00:08.580 --> 00:12.020
And I said, you know, often no, that's not always the case.

00:12.020 --> 00:16.660
We sometimes do submit bug reports, but most of the time when we review it, we're reviewing

00:16.660 --> 00:21.460
something that's been officially released and so we review it as if it's a finished

00:21.460 --> 00:23.240
product and then give our thoughts.

00:23.240 --> 00:28.620
But we do submit a ton of bugs and work with the communities that build a lot of the projects

00:28.620 --> 00:32.180
that we use internally to make the shows.

00:32.180 --> 00:36.740
So what's happened with this video, so it's a Python, if you search for Python audio visualizer

00:36.740 --> 00:38.900
in Google, you'll come across the project.

00:38.900 --> 00:43.420
It is amazing what's happened in the last couple of months because of the Jupiter broadcasting

00:43.420 --> 00:44.420
community.

00:44.420 --> 00:50.460
They have taken this thing from a pretty decent application that sits on top of FFmpeg.

00:50.460 --> 00:55.380
And I mean it, it almost chokes me up looking at it because they have taken this into something

00:55.380 --> 01:00.100
that is more competitive than anything that's available commercially, including some products

01:00.100 --> 01:04.500
I have looked at that require a monthly charge.

01:04.500 --> 01:05.500
And this thing is more competitive.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.500
That's crazy.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.780
And just because the community just got involved and it's going to make our shows better and

01:09.780 --> 01:10.940
it's going to make late night Linux better.

01:10.940 --> 01:14.400
It's one of those great examples, right, where clearly this was a need.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.400
People wanted this.

01:15.400 --> 01:19.700
Maybe not everyone had that clear conception yet, but once it was there, once it was started,

01:19.700 --> 01:22.780
there's just this natural momentum that's fascinating to watch.

01:22.780 --> 01:24.980
Yeah, I love open source.

01:24.980 --> 01:32.860
You could see how media production on Linux can be more successful in this paradigm.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.700
I don't know if it's going to be the truth.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.240
Maybe it's not the same for video editing.

01:36.240 --> 01:40.820
But this is something you can't do on a Mac or Windows.

01:40.820 --> 01:57.220
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 203 for July 4th, 2017.

01:57.220 --> 02:01.600
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's feeling the patriotic spirit

02:01.600 --> 02:02.680
or the bourbon.

02:02.680 --> 02:03.680
My name is Chris.

02:03.680 --> 02:04.680
My name is Wes.

02:04.680 --> 02:05.680
Hello, Wes.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.680
Quite a show for us today.

02:06.680 --> 02:07.680
That's amazing.

02:07.680 --> 02:11.980
Obviously we have the big barbecue going on right now as we record this, but we have some

02:11.980 --> 02:17.180
breaking news applicable to us Linux users, and apparently it is the season of stupid.

02:17.180 --> 02:21.660
We'll be talking about some developments in the community that really have your host quite

02:21.660 --> 02:22.660
ponderous.

02:22.660 --> 02:26.360
Then we'll give you a few updates on some stories we've talked about, discuss something

02:26.360 --> 02:31.280
big and bold the XDA developer forums is doing that us Linux users are going to like quite

02:31.280 --> 02:33.900
a bit, and then package kit.

02:33.900 --> 02:34.900
You know it.

02:34.900 --> 02:35.900
You love it.

02:35.900 --> 02:39.340
We'll give you the platform package management possible.

02:39.340 --> 02:44.060
Turns out a little crashy, a little crashy, a little unstable on Fedora.

02:44.060 --> 02:47.180
We'll give you the reasons why you might want to avoid package kit on Fedora, at least for

02:47.180 --> 02:51.740
this release, and something might change in the future, and then we'll discuss System

02:51.740 --> 02:58.300
76's new operating system as well as a way for you to hide your Steam... Well, I won't

02:58.300 --> 03:00.300
call... I won't quote RMS.

03:00.300 --> 03:02.980
We'll just say it's semi-negative in the Freedom Dimension games.

03:02.980 --> 03:06.460
We'll tell you how you can hide those and isolate them from your system.

03:06.460 --> 03:07.460
You found that one.

03:07.460 --> 03:08.460
Oh yeah, I did.

03:08.460 --> 03:09.460
You found a good one.

03:09.460 --> 03:14.940
Plus, it seems that Rust is taking over as the language of choice for the Linux desktop.

03:14.940 --> 03:17.540
I think we're officially Rust fanboys on this show.

03:17.540 --> 03:18.540
I don't even know how that happened.

03:18.540 --> 03:19.540
I agree.

03:19.540 --> 03:20.540
Well, I think because we both listen to Koda Radio.

03:20.540 --> 03:24.740
It's because you like Firefox so much and you're excited about Servo.

03:24.740 --> 03:25.740
That's totally what it is, dude.

03:25.740 --> 03:29.900
No, you know, it's like Apple's got their Swift and we've got Rust.

03:29.900 --> 03:30.900
You know what I mean?

03:30.900 --> 03:33.060
The branding is traditionally an open source.

03:33.060 --> 03:35.820
We're not quite on their game with that, but it is fun to say.

03:35.820 --> 03:39.780
And Rust looks like a really, really serious, really good technology.

03:39.780 --> 03:43.140
And we'll tell you about how it's making... Potentially.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.900
I guess it hasn't actually come yet.

03:44.900 --> 03:49.860
How it could potentially make GNOME much better, a little more crash-proof, thanks to a Google

03:49.860 --> 03:51.300
Summer of Code project.

03:51.300 --> 03:55.380
But Mr. West, I hope that the audience out in the living room... We have a small group

03:55.380 --> 03:58.060
out in the audience in the living room, as I just said.

03:58.060 --> 04:00.140
You say small, but those are some heavy hitters out there.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.140
Geez.

04:01.140 --> 04:02.140
And boy, was it some good food.

04:02.140 --> 04:07.940
So we're doing the barbecue right now, the 4th of July episode 200 barbecue.

04:07.940 --> 04:10.700
And all-star, Wes Payne right here.

04:10.700 --> 04:11.700
Thank you.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.640
I mean, knocked it out of the park with the bratwurst.

04:13.640 --> 04:15.220
Unbelievably good.

04:15.220 --> 04:17.980
And rumor has it you are up till 2 AM working on those Sons of Guns.

04:17.980 --> 04:18.980
Oh, maybe.

04:18.980 --> 04:19.980
Just a little bit.

04:19.980 --> 04:22.580
Soaked in butter, beer, and onions.

04:22.580 --> 04:23.580
Mmm.

04:23.580 --> 04:24.580
Nature's finest.

04:24.580 --> 04:25.580
Super good, Wes.

04:25.580 --> 04:26.580
Super good.

04:26.580 --> 04:27.580
And everybody ate those things up.

04:27.580 --> 04:28.580
The food here has been amazing today.

04:28.580 --> 04:32.860
We're cooking rib-eyes, we're cooking burgers, we're cooking the bratwurst, and we've also

04:32.860 --> 04:35.300
got some great veggie skewers, and...

04:35.300 --> 04:37.740
Don't forget that... Oh, you got it.

04:37.740 --> 04:38.740
What?

04:38.740 --> 04:39.740
No, go ahead.

04:39.740 --> 04:40.740
I was going to say that avocado.

04:40.740 --> 04:42.780
The fried avocado.

04:42.780 --> 04:44.540
Just really a game changer.

04:44.540 --> 04:48.340
But I'm hoping that those people out in the living room... I'm talking directly to them.

04:48.340 --> 04:53.100
I hope right now that they will keep an ear out for a knock, knock, knock at the door,

04:53.100 --> 04:59.060
because UPS is supposed to deliver my brewery today, which is a Linux-powered, one-touch

04:59.060 --> 05:03.500
Linux brewing machine of the beer.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.500
No way.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.500
Of the beer, Wes.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.300
And that should be delivered as we do this show today.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.860
It was something that Blaster and I went into.

05:09.860 --> 05:10.940
So buddy, I think it's almost here.

05:10.940 --> 05:16.040
If you hit me up on Telegram, we should definitely do a vlog or two about this thing.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.740
You put all the ingredients in there, you push a button, and then you come back in a

05:18.740 --> 05:19.740
couple of weeks and you've got beer.

05:19.740 --> 05:21.940
So you're saying in a couple weeks, I can come back.

05:21.940 --> 05:22.940
I don't think so.

05:22.940 --> 05:23.940
You can drink beer.

05:23.940 --> 05:24.940
You'll have beer.

05:24.940 --> 05:25.940
I think that could be the case.

05:25.940 --> 05:28.140
In the meantime, I've got something better for you, though.

05:28.140 --> 05:29.140
You ready for this?

05:29.140 --> 05:30.140
Surprise me.

05:30.140 --> 05:31.140
It's our virtual log.

05:31.140 --> 05:32.140
Time appropriate.

05:32.140 --> 05:33.140
Greetings, Mumble Room.

05:33.140 --> 05:34.140
Greetings.

05:34.140 --> 05:35.140
Hello.

05:35.140 --> 05:36.180
Hello, gentlemen.

05:36.180 --> 05:37.180
It is good to see you.

05:37.180 --> 05:38.400
I hope everyone is well in there.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.940
We have a really good show for you this week, so I'm glad you're here.

05:41.940 --> 05:42.940
Thank you very much.

05:42.940 --> 05:46.740
Now, Wes, before we go any further, we've got to stop and just mention something really

05:46.740 --> 05:50.500
quickly, because I know not everyone listening to this show listens to user air, although

05:50.500 --> 05:51.660
they should be.

05:51.660 --> 05:52.660
I know they're not.

05:52.660 --> 05:53.660
They should be.

05:53.660 --> 05:54.660
I understand.

05:54.660 --> 05:59.660
And I just want to give them a heads up that we have a bit of a giveaway going on, a sweepstakes,

05:59.660 --> 06:00.660
if you will.

06:00.660 --> 06:01.660
Don't call it a giveaway, Wes.

06:01.660 --> 06:02.660
It's a sweepstakes.

06:02.660 --> 06:03.660
It is a sweepstakes.

06:03.660 --> 06:04.660
100% sweep.

06:04.660 --> 06:05.660
That's right.

06:05.660 --> 06:08.420
User Air is doing a sweepstakes for the Dell XPS 13.

06:08.420 --> 06:09.420
13.

06:09.420 --> 06:10.420
Yeah, that's right.

06:10.420 --> 06:11.420
You have one of those, buddy.

06:11.420 --> 06:12.420
Oh, yeah, I do.

06:12.420 --> 06:13.420
Yeah, you do.

06:13.420 --> 06:14.420
You have the original.

06:14.420 --> 06:15.420
And we're going to give one away.

06:15.420 --> 06:16.900
We're going to give a brand new one away.

06:16.900 --> 06:17.900
Give it to me.

06:17.900 --> 06:18.900
Give it to me.

06:18.900 --> 06:19.900
It's for me, guys.

06:19.900 --> 06:20.900
Sorry.

06:20.900 --> 06:21.900
You already have one.

06:21.900 --> 06:22.900
Yeah.

06:22.900 --> 06:23.900
It's for me.

06:23.900 --> 06:24.900
It's a sweepstakes.

06:24.900 --> 06:25.900
Don't call it a giveaway, Dylan.

06:25.900 --> 06:26.900
It is for me.

06:26.900 --> 06:27.900
Sweepstakes.

06:27.900 --> 06:28.900
Now, here's the thing.

06:28.900 --> 06:29.900
It's for U.S. residents.

06:29.900 --> 06:30.900
It's a sweepstakes, by the way.

06:30.900 --> 06:31.900
Yeah.

06:31.900 --> 06:32.900
And it's for U.S. residents only.

06:32.900 --> 06:33.900
You have to be 18 years or older.

06:33.900 --> 06:34.900
I'm 19.

06:34.900 --> 06:35.900
No, you are not.

06:35.900 --> 06:39.660
You go to jupiterbroadcasting.com, click on shows, and go to User Air.

06:39.660 --> 06:42.820
It's in the User Air description, right at the top of the User Air show.

06:42.820 --> 06:45.660
We're going to be giving away the laptop... Oh, I'm sorry.

06:45.660 --> 06:46.660
It's not a giveaway.

06:46.660 --> 06:47.660
It's a... Sweepstakes.

06:47.660 --> 06:53.020
Yeah, we'll be doing the sweepstakes in User Air to give away... I'm sorry.

06:53.020 --> 06:54.900
It's a... Sweepstakes.

06:54.900 --> 06:59.320
To stake an XPS 13 to a listener of the User Air show, and we want you to have a chance

06:59.320 --> 07:00.320
to get in there.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.320
Just go to jupiterbroadcasting.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.320
So we sweep the stakes?

07:02.320 --> 07:03.320
Yeah.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.320
Yeah, we're going to sweep them.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.820
So go to jupiterbroadcasting.com, click on shows, and then go down to User Air.

07:06.820 --> 07:10.400
Right there in the description where we have what the show's about and our contact information,

07:10.400 --> 07:12.900
we have a temporary link for the sweepstakes.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.700
I want you to get an XPS 13.

07:14.700 --> 07:18.800
If you're over in the EU, just come over and live in the U.S. for just a little while.

07:18.800 --> 07:19.800
It's worth it.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.020
These XPSs are great.

07:21.020 --> 07:22.020
Get the Dell XPS 13.

07:22.020 --> 07:23.020
We hear that the ear needs a roommate.

07:23.020 --> 07:24.020
That's true.

07:24.020 --> 07:25.900
Yeah, you could just crash here in the garage for a little bit.

07:25.900 --> 07:26.900
Yeah.

07:26.900 --> 07:27.900
There you go.

07:27.900 --> 07:28.900
Sorry, you have to be 18 years.

07:28.900 --> 07:29.900
Sorry about the 18 years or older, Dylan.

07:29.900 --> 07:30.900
Sorry about that.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.300
Sorry about that.

07:32.300 --> 07:35.260
Let's start with that rust thing I was just talking about, because this is neat, and it's

07:35.260 --> 07:36.260
summertime.

07:36.260 --> 07:40.980
The Googles has the summer of codes, and I don't really need to explain this, do I?

07:40.980 --> 07:42.980
Because everybody knows what this is at this point.

07:42.980 --> 07:46.500
People throw some money around during the summer to employ some students to build things,

07:46.500 --> 07:50.020
and often they build open-source things that we all use and love, and sometimes have actually

07:50.020 --> 07:54.180
turned into long-term projects that we use today.

07:54.180 --> 08:00.020
Philip is one of these blokes who is going to be working on the – I think it's the

08:00.020 --> 08:01.660
GNOME JavaScript server.

08:01.660 --> 08:07.620
I think it's – it's GJS, so I'm kind of guessing at the acronym, and he's worked

08:07.620 --> 08:08.620
on it for quite a long time.

08:08.620 --> 08:13.660
He's going to be mentoring someone that's paid by Google to essentially rewrite this

08:13.660 --> 08:20.540
JavaScript binding for GNOME and rewrite it using Rust to make it stable, essentially

08:20.540 --> 08:21.540
more craft-proof.

08:21.540 --> 08:24.740
It's not just GNOME Shell that uses this.

08:24.740 --> 08:30.700
GNOME Documents, GNOME Maps, Polari, Sushi, GNOME Photos, a lot of things that are modern

08:30.700 --> 08:35.020
GTK applications use this backend, this GJS backend.

08:35.020 --> 08:38.180
JavaScript really is everywhere, even not the hip places.

08:38.180 --> 08:44.380
I think right now – I think right now the current version uses Mozilla's SpiderMonkey

08:44.380 --> 08:48.220
for the engine, and so this is going to be a rewrite of that in Rust.

08:48.220 --> 08:50.820
And the reason why I mention this, so this was actually a highly-submitted story to the

08:50.820 --> 08:54.620
show this week because a lot on JB, we've been talking about some of the GNOME crashing

08:54.620 --> 08:58.620
issues we've had recently, and so somebody submitted this as a possible, like, hey, look,

08:58.620 --> 08:59.620
things are improving.

08:59.620 --> 09:06.260
I've also heard some – it's not rumors because they're blog posts, but I have heard

09:06.260 --> 09:10.980
some implication that there has been some work at Canonical on Mudder, and I'm not

09:10.980 --> 09:16.020
clear on what that work has been, but you combine different people working on this stuff,

09:16.020 --> 09:19.060
and it could start shoring up some of these problems that we've experienced with GNOME

09:19.060 --> 09:20.060
pretty quick.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.580
And this is just the kind of thing that you need.

09:21.580 --> 09:22.780
It won't be the be-all, end-all.

09:22.780 --> 09:27.100
It's not going to be the next thing maybe that you run on your system even, but this

09:27.100 --> 09:30.020
can lower that barrier to entry suddenly if Rust becomes a thing that, like, oh, yeah,

09:30.020 --> 09:31.020
you already have build support.

09:31.020 --> 09:34.740
If you want to add a module that's in Rust and not in C or C++, you can.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.900
I think that really opens the door.

09:35.900 --> 09:39.100
So if this works out, hey, that would be great.

09:39.100 --> 09:42.900
And you can find out more in the link in the show notes.

09:42.900 --> 09:45.500
Let's talk about the new kernel that came out.

09:45.500 --> 09:48.540
So I just want to do a couple of pieces of breaking news right now.

09:48.540 --> 09:54.020
Let's talk about the new kernel release, and let's talk about the WikiLeaks document

09:54.020 --> 09:58.340
dump that shows the CIA was targeting Linux users because this is probably the one that's

09:58.340 --> 10:01.260
getting the most attention as we record the show right now.

10:01.260 --> 10:03.460
It's named Outlaw Country.

10:03.460 --> 10:07.460
You may have heard that name floating around, and it's a Linux kernel module that gets

10:07.460 --> 10:12.940
loaded into the system and creates a new entry in IP tables, and then once it does that,

10:12.940 --> 10:17.660
it forwards all the traffic to whoever they want it forwarded to, and the attacker, in

10:17.660 --> 10:22.880
this case the CIA or whoever has this code, could then reroute to whatever mining system

10:22.880 --> 10:23.880
they have or whatever.

10:23.880 --> 10:27.060
Now, what I'm not clear about from this exploit is it seems like you could just do

10:27.060 --> 10:32.900
an IP tables list and you would see this entry, so not only would it be pretty easy to detect

10:32.900 --> 10:38.460
if you were looking for it, but you also would have to have executed this exploit with root

10:38.460 --> 10:40.680
privileges.

10:40.680 --> 10:44.780
I think some of the issues there are that, one, it adds a new table, and so unless you

10:44.780 --> 10:48.020
actually specify that table, by default you won't know, right?

10:48.020 --> 10:50.540
You'll be like, oh, well, it's not in my NAT rules and it's not in the default

10:50.540 --> 10:51.540
table.

10:51.540 --> 10:52.860
Right, so it's not like you're going to look at your config and see it.

10:52.860 --> 10:57.420
Plus, it's most likely on, you know, here we're relying on admins in the middle because

10:57.420 --> 10:59.700
it's not like they're going to be infecting you most likely with this kind of thing.

10:59.700 --> 11:04.260
It's going to be at some router or some NAT or some web server that wants to know who's

11:04.260 --> 11:08.820
visiting that website and it's been running on a VPS for six months and you're not checking

11:08.820 --> 11:09.820
the logs.

11:09.820 --> 11:13.580
What's interesting, though, is this doesn't give itself access to the system, so you have

11:13.580 --> 11:20.660
to take advantage of another existing vulnerability in the Linux system to get access to run this.

11:20.660 --> 11:23.260
So this doesn't give you the access.

11:23.260 --> 11:26.300
You know, it does also say to me maybe that, hey, this is one of those things people who

11:26.300 --> 11:29.180
are pushing UEFI maybe were thinking about, right?

11:29.180 --> 11:31.780
Otherwise, if this module has to be signed, hey, that'd be nice.

11:31.780 --> 11:35.100
Can I tell you the honest truth, though?

11:35.100 --> 11:40.020
After the Snowden leaks, I was feeling pretty cocky because they had stuff on there about

11:40.020 --> 11:44.300
exploiting Macs through Thunderbolt and they had stuff in there about going after Windows

11:44.300 --> 11:49.820
and Windows servers, but Linux desktop users, if you go by the Snowden leaks, were just

11:49.820 --> 11:50.820
totally off the radar.

11:50.820 --> 11:54.820
Like, they weren't even worried about Linux users and I'm like, hey, hey, hey, look at

11:54.820 --> 11:55.820
me.

11:55.820 --> 11:57.540
I'm like James Bond just by running Linux.

11:57.540 --> 12:02.020
And then I see this WikiLeaks dump here from the CIA and they're going after Linux users.

12:02.020 --> 12:04.860
And here I thought Linux users were upstanding moral citizens.

12:04.860 --> 12:05.860
Yeah, yeah.

12:05.860 --> 12:06.860
I guess I was wrong.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.460
Yeah, of course they're going after the servers.

12:08.460 --> 12:09.460
That's the problem.

12:09.460 --> 12:13.180
So yeah, if you hear the story going around and you hear them talking about outlaw country,

12:13.180 --> 12:17.540
just keep in mind that it's just, all it is, it's a kernel module that maybe it does some

12:17.540 --> 12:22.140
other nefarious things, but mostly just injects rules into IP tables, which is just, the reason

12:22.140 --> 12:25.660
why it's a kernel module is because like Wes just said, it doesn't check your config and

12:25.660 --> 12:28.840
so it has to be able to apply it to your config after it's been loaded.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.460
And that's why it's a module.

12:30.460 --> 12:33.380
And really the worst part is that it makes you have to go look at IP tables.

12:33.380 --> 12:34.380
So sorry, everyone.

12:34.380 --> 12:39.020
You know how you bring down the entire spying industrial complex?

12:39.020 --> 12:41.660
You sue them for GPL violations, right?

12:41.660 --> 12:45.540
I bet you that's not GPL compliant.

12:45.540 --> 12:46.540
You follow up on that.

12:46.540 --> 12:47.540
Mm-hmm.

12:47.540 --> 12:50.540
And then just before we get into the good stuff, I mean the stuff I really – I got

12:50.540 --> 12:53.340
a couple of more things I want to talk about with you guys.

12:53.340 --> 12:56.940
kernel 4.12 came out today, that's the other big breaking news.

12:56.940 --> 12:58.660
That might have been yesterday.

12:58.660 --> 13:00.060
But it just came out.

13:00.060 --> 13:05.900
And the big thing in here is BFQ, the BFQ scheduler and USB type C manager that I talked

13:05.900 --> 13:09.420
about in a recent episode has been integrated into the kernel.

13:09.420 --> 13:12.460
Also actually I should say Vegas support too, which is going to matter to a lot of you.

13:12.460 --> 13:14.540
Vegas support has been added as well.

13:14.540 --> 13:18.900
And the thing that I'm very excited about, although I've gotten mixed feedback on this

13:18.900 --> 13:22.160
and I would like to get more, and maybe if anybody in the Mumble Room knows, please feel

13:22.160 --> 13:28.300
free to interrupt me, BFQ, which is the better, faster, quicker scheduler, the scheduler that

13:28.300 --> 13:32.260
sets the priority for like all the things going on and access to IO.

13:32.260 --> 13:37.260
If you've ever had a Linux box, I can replicate this on Linux every Wednesday night.

13:37.260 --> 13:39.260
I replicate – I have this scenario.

13:39.260 --> 13:44.380
I open up Chrome and then I go to pinboard and I load up all of the links I have for

13:44.380 --> 13:47.980
that night's unfilter and I go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom and I'm using my middle

13:47.980 --> 13:51.220
click and I click, click, click, click, click along my pinboard list and I open tab after

13:51.220 --> 13:54.840
tab after tab after tab after tab and some of them have flash.

13:54.840 --> 13:59.900
Most of them actually have flash because I'm linking to news sites and the whole system,

13:59.900 --> 14:04.940
the entire system locks up for about 10 seconds, 15 seconds.

14:04.940 --> 14:06.780
Just long enough you can't do anything else.

14:06.780 --> 14:07.780
You can't get up.

14:07.780 --> 14:08.780
No.

14:08.780 --> 14:09.780
No.

14:09.780 --> 14:11.040
And BFQ promises to solve that problem.

14:11.040 --> 14:15.820
Now a lot of people say there's ways that you can fix this without BFQ but in a nutshell

14:15.820 --> 14:20.920
it's an IO scheduler that balances how the system accesses data on a drive and supposedly

14:20.920 --> 14:23.140
it has improvements for SSDs.

14:23.140 --> 14:27.860
BFQ targets desktop users by ensuring that at no point a single application is using

14:27.860 --> 14:29.860
all of the bandwidth.

14:29.860 --> 14:34.900
Sometimes when copying large files in Linux a user sees systems slow down or freeze completely.

14:34.900 --> 14:36.260
This will now be a thing of the past.

14:36.260 --> 14:39.260
I like the way the Arch Wiki as always describes it.

14:39.260 --> 14:43.740
Budget fair queuing is a disk scheduler which allows each process slash thread to be assigned

14:43.740 --> 14:45.420
a portion of the disk throughput.

14:45.420 --> 14:49.140
So that kind of explains how you're – again, this may be the case where you wouldn't want

14:49.140 --> 14:53.980
it on a server but you might minimize your maximum throughput but it should give better

14:53.980 --> 14:56.660
latencies for desktop users or at least that's what people say.

14:56.660 --> 14:57.660
Yeah.

14:57.660 --> 15:00.960
And by the way the USB type C stuff is like the stuff that figures out charging based

15:00.960 --> 15:01.960
on what has –

15:01.960 --> 15:02.960
Oh my God.

15:02.960 --> 15:03.960
The future is here now.

15:03.960 --> 15:04.960
Yeah.

15:04.960 --> 15:07.700
If you're living the USB lifestyle that's a good kernel for you to get.

15:07.700 --> 15:11.940
You're not mandatory USB – your USB-C devices will still work fine.

15:11.940 --> 15:15.980
But if you upgrade to that kernel you'll get the smart intelligence where it decides

15:15.980 --> 15:21.380
oh, that's a phone, I should charge it and not charge from the phone which could happen

15:21.380 --> 15:22.380
right now under Linux.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.380
We'll see.

15:23.380 --> 15:24.620
It's kind of adorable.

15:24.620 --> 15:28.940
We had the first USB-C support so I'll give us credit for that.

15:28.940 --> 15:29.940
We were there first.

15:29.940 --> 15:30.940
We just do it our own way.

15:30.940 --> 15:31.940
Yeah.

15:31.940 --> 15:32.940
Okay.

15:32.940 --> 15:36.980
And then the last kind of newsy thing before we get into the nuts and bolts of the community

15:36.980 --> 15:42.440
stuff this week, Wes found this and I just found it awesome because when you stopped

15:42.440 --> 15:46.620
by UserAir a few weeks ago you were talking about playing around with SystemD's Nspawn

15:46.620 --> 15:47.620
and container support.

15:47.620 --> 15:48.620
Yeah.

15:48.620 --> 15:49.620
That's right.

15:49.620 --> 15:52.620
And so here's somebody who self-admittedly is not a Linux expert – his name is Drew

15:52.620 --> 15:53.620
I guess.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.620
I'm not sure.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.340
I don't know what his name is.

15:56.340 --> 16:02.600
And he's been messing around with confining Steam into a SystemD Nspawn container.

16:02.600 --> 16:06.940
And I don't – I've never set one of these up yet but if I'm understanding correctly

16:06.940 --> 16:12.500
– well, he did it to play around with too but it was a great way to sort of solve the

16:12.500 --> 16:17.060
32-bit library problem because instead of spewing 32-bit libraries all over your system,

16:17.060 --> 16:23.060
you contain it all to this container and you don't have to like – if none of your other

16:23.060 --> 16:24.780
applications need it, you don't have to bother with it.

16:24.780 --> 16:25.780
Yeah, exactly.

16:25.780 --> 16:26.780
It's this crossover now.

16:26.780 --> 16:29.860
Finally like containers are big on that in the development side of things because exactly

16:29.860 --> 16:30.860
that.

16:30.860 --> 16:32.380
You don't want all of these – I have six different projects.

16:32.380 --> 16:35.500
I don't want the dependencies or the libraries from all of these different things on my

16:35.500 --> 16:36.500
system.

16:36.500 --> 16:37.500
I don't want to mess in this.

16:37.500 --> 16:40.740
I don't want to cause dependency hell or have some weird app thing go on.

16:40.740 --> 16:41.740
Containers are perfect for that.

16:41.740 --> 16:43.380
And now it's like yeah, I don't want 32-bit libraries.

16:43.380 --> 16:45.340
I don't want to have to deal with that.

16:45.340 --> 16:48.520
And yeah, he points out some of the things like FireJail or other alternatives which

16:48.520 --> 16:52.020
can work for some of the – getting more control over the process.

16:52.020 --> 16:56.140
But he's using SystemD Nspawn it seems like – mostly just because it's built in.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.140
Yeah, it's built in.

16:57.140 --> 16:58.140
It's right there.

16:58.140 --> 16:59.340
It's really easy to go.

16:59.340 --> 17:03.300
And it makes it super simple to be – you can pretend maybe you don't want to use a

17:03.300 --> 17:06.620
cloud provider or something that you would need something local like for Steam, boom,

17:06.620 --> 17:07.620
perfect.

17:07.620 --> 17:08.860
Throw away Linux distribution.

17:08.860 --> 17:10.580
Yeah, exactly.

17:10.580 --> 17:13.700
And the thing that would have tripped me up, and this is why I like his post and we'll

17:13.700 --> 17:18.380
have it linked in the show notes, is he talks about getting the X applications out of that

17:18.380 --> 17:19.380
container.

17:19.380 --> 17:21.920
And actually at first this was a bit major hurdle.

17:21.920 --> 17:25.140
But these days between Docker and SystemD Nspawn there's like a thousand guides out

17:25.140 --> 17:26.140
there for how to do that.

17:26.140 --> 17:27.940
It's really pretty easy.

17:27.940 --> 17:29.940
X needs some stuff that's under slash temp.

17:29.940 --> 17:32.100
You can also do other things like you can share special devices.

17:32.100 --> 17:33.100
You can mount stuff.

17:33.100 --> 17:37.020
SystemD Nspawn makes it super simple to just bind mount stuff.

17:37.020 --> 17:38.140
Networking is really easy.

17:38.140 --> 17:43.180
If you use SystemD NetworkD they have a lot of primitive setup to just, boom, NAT's already

17:43.180 --> 17:44.180
there.

17:44.180 --> 17:45.740
Your containers automatically get set up behind the NAT.

17:45.740 --> 17:48.020
They've got their own private IP address.

17:48.020 --> 17:49.400
Super simple.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.420
And SystemD Nspawn can run Docker containers.

17:52.420 --> 17:54.660
So you can use all the Docker build stuff.

17:54.660 --> 17:55.660
You can use – yeah, exactly.

17:55.660 --> 17:57.280
Oh, I did not know that.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.280
But it makes sense.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.420
Because it's just a file system that you start a process on.

18:00.420 --> 18:01.420
Right.

18:01.420 --> 18:03.420
I'm going to chew on that.

18:03.420 --> 18:04.420
So I don't know.

18:04.420 --> 18:06.940
In the background you might be able to hear some of the barbecue going on.

18:06.940 --> 18:09.940
The barbecue continues while we do the show which is awesome.

18:09.940 --> 18:12.980
And not only do we have a crowd out there but we have a big crowd in the Mumble Room

18:12.980 --> 18:14.340
which is pretty exciting.

18:14.340 --> 18:18.220
And Mr. Popey is back after a little bit of a stay.

18:18.220 --> 18:23.760
Mr. Popey, did you happen to go to the recent Snap Sprint held by Canonical?

18:23.760 --> 18:24.760
I did.

18:24.760 --> 18:29.940
I was there Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and then I had a conference to get you on Thursday,

18:29.940 --> 18:31.820
Friday to go and give a talk about Snaps.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.500
So yeah, it was great.

18:33.500 --> 18:37.780
It was nice to see a bunch of people from different projects, people from KDE, from

18:37.780 --> 18:40.460
elementary, from Nome, from Flora.

18:40.460 --> 18:43.660
It was really nice to have everyone in the Canonical office and all working together

18:43.660 --> 18:44.660
to make Snaps better.

18:44.660 --> 18:45.660
It was good fun.

18:45.660 --> 18:46.660
Yeah.

18:46.660 --> 18:48.620
And I've seen some recent news about Nome software.

18:48.620 --> 18:52.220
Is that as a result of some of the work that came out of that Sprint?

18:52.220 --> 18:53.740
Yeah, definitely.

18:53.740 --> 18:59.460
Robert Ansell who maintains software from the Ubuntu side was there.

18:59.460 --> 19:03.940
But also Richard Hughes who works on, who's the upstream maintainer for Nome software

19:03.940 --> 19:04.940
was there as well.

19:04.940 --> 19:08.380
And so there are lots of conversations they can have about improving the experience for

19:08.380 --> 19:16.340
installing Snaps on any distro, not just on Ubuntu and improving things like how options

19:16.340 --> 19:20.620
are presented to users and there was lots of discussion about how to improve that kind

19:20.620 --> 19:21.620
of stuff.

19:21.620 --> 19:23.780
So it was really, really nice to see all these working together in the office.

19:23.780 --> 19:24.780
Yeah.

19:24.780 --> 19:25.780
That is really cool.

19:25.780 --> 19:27.460
All the different walks of Linux.

19:27.460 --> 19:33.540
You know, I was listening to the Ubuntu podcast today and I noticed that you sort of built

19:33.540 --> 19:37.900
a better, improved Mycroft and I was wondering are you going to launch an Indiegogo for that

19:37.900 --> 19:40.220
anytime soon because I might be willing to back that.

19:40.220 --> 19:43.580
You mean launch an Indiegogo and then not deliver for two years?

19:43.580 --> 19:44.580
Yeah.

19:44.580 --> 19:45.580
I think I can do that.

19:45.580 --> 19:46.580
That's what Chris prefers actually.

19:46.580 --> 19:47.580
Yeah.

19:47.580 --> 19:48.580
You got a long time.

19:48.580 --> 19:49.580
That's what I'm used to at least.

19:49.580 --> 19:52.180
You could have a stretch goal for Palmer Violets included.

19:52.180 --> 19:53.180
Yeah.

19:53.180 --> 19:54.180
Okay.

19:54.180 --> 19:55.180
Hello Mr. Wimpy.

19:55.180 --> 19:56.180
How are you?

19:56.180 --> 19:57.180
I'm very well.

19:57.180 --> 20:01.180
We've had a great, I mean we've had unbelievable food here at the studio.

20:01.180 --> 20:03.340
It turned out it was so, so, so good.

20:03.340 --> 20:05.420
Were you at the Sprint yourself?

20:05.420 --> 20:06.420
I was.

20:06.420 --> 20:07.420
Yes.

20:07.420 --> 20:08.420
Well, welcome.

20:08.420 --> 20:09.420
Welcome.

20:09.420 --> 20:10.420
Now I'm jealous.

20:10.420 --> 20:11.420
It's nice both of you guys here.

20:11.420 --> 20:12.420
Now if rumor has it, are you going to be AFK soon?

20:12.420 --> 20:13.420
Are you going to be traveling?

20:13.420 --> 20:14.860
Are you going to be on staycation?

20:14.860 --> 20:15.860
Like what's happening soon?

20:15.860 --> 20:19.620
Because I think if I'm not mistaken, I didn't expect you to be here today.

20:19.620 --> 20:20.820
Yeah.

20:20.820 --> 20:24.680
So our schedule is a little bit off by one at the moment on the Ubuntu podcast.

20:24.680 --> 20:28.460
We just recorded one episode of Ubuntu podcast this evening.

20:28.460 --> 20:32.020
So we were let out of school early.

20:32.020 --> 20:33.020
Very good one.

20:33.020 --> 20:34.500
I'm glad you made it here.

20:34.500 --> 20:40.420
Now we have some good stuff to get into today including, I'm really excited.

20:40.420 --> 20:43.540
I know Pharaonix gets a lot of crap.

20:43.540 --> 20:44.540
Some of it from you.

20:44.540 --> 20:45.540
Yeah.

20:45.540 --> 20:46.540
Okay.

20:46.540 --> 20:47.540
Fair enough.

20:47.540 --> 20:48.540
It does.

20:48.540 --> 20:49.540
I mean what?

20:49.540 --> 20:50.540
No, you're right.

20:50.540 --> 20:51.540
I mean I will own that.

20:51.540 --> 20:52.540
I have.

20:52.540 --> 20:59.100
But at the same time, I do respect Michael Arboul's hustle to put it in sort of …

20:59.100 --> 21:01.700
Whatever you think of the output, there is a lot of output.

21:01.700 --> 21:02.700
There is a lot of output.

21:02.700 --> 21:04.140
There is a lot of hustle.

21:04.140 --> 21:08.560
But actually where a lot of my respect comes from for Michael is what he has done with

21:08.560 --> 21:09.560
OpenBenchmark.

21:09.560 --> 21:15.180
It's just the Pharaonix test suit, if I were him, I would rename it and I know that's

21:15.180 --> 21:16.180
really a hard thing to hear.

21:16.180 --> 21:19.520
But if I were him, I would honestly rename it to the OpenBenchmark test suite because

21:19.520 --> 21:24.260
it uploads to OpenBenchmark.org and I have found it to be such a useful tool not because

21:24.260 --> 21:28.660
I'm all into benchmarks and numbers but because it gives me baselines to see how machines

21:28.660 --> 21:31.260
compare to each other that I'm testing up against each other.

21:31.260 --> 21:34.740
Some heuristics you can use later when you're trying to evaluate them really quickly.

21:34.740 --> 21:35.740
Yeah, absolutely.

21:35.740 --> 21:39.500
And then as a reviewer, I can publish links to that and say now run it against your own

21:39.500 --> 21:41.460
system and just see the delta.

21:41.460 --> 21:44.860
It's not about what – it's about the gap in the numbers, not what the numbers are.

21:44.860 --> 21:45.860
Right.

21:45.860 --> 21:46.860
There's no absolute measure here.

21:46.860 --> 21:47.860
It doesn't matter.

21:47.860 --> 21:51.020
It's an amazing resource and that database is growing and growing and growing.

21:51.020 --> 21:58.460
So Pharaonix has been – I think actually in total, a pretty good resource and when

21:58.460 --> 22:01.860
anybody is working that hard and publishing that often, you're going to get a couple

22:01.860 --> 22:04.980
of things wrong here or there, especially if you don't have an editor, if it's a

22:04.980 --> 22:05.980
one-person team.

22:05.980 --> 22:09.740
So I can understand some of the mistakes that people have criticized in the past.

22:09.740 --> 22:15.840
They're somewhat unfortunate and I think it's been a good resource but I think what

22:15.840 --> 22:22.780
we could really use in this space is some competition.

22:22.780 --> 22:30.260
This week, XDA, the ones that have traditionally exceedingly well-covered, ROMs and that whole

22:30.260 --> 22:35.180
development community, announced that they were going to cover PC hardware with a specific

22:35.180 --> 22:41.220
focus on Linux and open source and they've got some really good things that they're

22:41.220 --> 22:47.540
thinking about and they capture and cover some of the feedback from their readers and

22:47.540 --> 22:48.740
I've been talking to the author.

22:48.740 --> 22:50.180
I don't think he's going to make it.

22:50.180 --> 22:54.940
He was going to meet us up today in the show but you know, mumble, hashtag mumble problems.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.700
Wow, did you hear that?

22:56.700 --> 22:57.700
That's America.

22:57.700 --> 22:59.420
Did you guys hear that in the mumble room?

22:59.420 --> 23:00.420
Did you hear that in the background?

23:00.420 --> 23:01.420
Yup.

23:01.420 --> 23:03.940
Yeah, that's fireworks that are going off already right there.

23:03.940 --> 23:05.700
We're having a small war with the neighbors.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.020
I think we're going to win though.

23:07.020 --> 23:08.540
The charge is happening as we speak.

23:08.540 --> 23:09.840
We do have a larger group here.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.020
We do have a larger group.

23:11.020 --> 23:14.340
So I want to talk about what they're all doing and why I think it's a big deal and how they're

23:14.340 --> 23:19.460
doing it differently and honestly, the brilliant point they made about why they're starting

23:19.460 --> 23:20.460
it.

23:20.460 --> 23:22.380
So we're going to talk about that next but first I want to talk about Ting.

23:22.380 --> 23:24.680
Go to linux.ting.com.

23:24.680 --> 23:29.700
That supports the show but it also gives you $25 in service credit if you bring a device

23:29.700 --> 23:32.420
or $25 off your first device.

23:32.420 --> 23:34.580
Mobile plans used to drive me crazy.

23:34.580 --> 23:35.780
It's obviously a scam.

23:35.780 --> 23:36.780
You can sense it.

23:36.780 --> 23:37.780
You can suss that out.

23:37.780 --> 23:38.780
You're smart enough.

23:38.780 --> 23:39.780
You know that they're scamming you.

23:39.780 --> 23:45.300
They're really only capable of doing this because they have a duopoly.

23:45.300 --> 23:49.280
It's AT&T and Verizon and they have a duopoly and so they're able to do all these kinds

23:49.280 --> 23:53.200
of crazy things and then the competitors have to wear crazy leather jackets and pink shirts

23:53.200 --> 23:57.540
and make all kinds of crazy claims and completely destroy net neutrality to sell phones.

23:57.540 --> 24:00.140
It's a horrible competitive environment.

24:00.140 --> 24:04.100
If you go to linux.ting.com, you can make a difference.

24:04.100 --> 24:06.560
Linux.ting.com is mobile the way it would have been done.

24:06.560 --> 24:11.180
If you hit the reset button on wireless, this is how you would do mobile, right?

24:11.180 --> 24:12.700
It's pay for what you use.

24:12.700 --> 24:14.640
It's $6 a month for your line.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.940
Think about that for a second.

24:15.940 --> 24:17.020
So you want a cell phone line?

24:17.020 --> 24:18.020
It's $6 a month.

24:18.020 --> 24:21.300
Okay, now your kid gets a little bit older, you want to get them a cell phone, $6 a month.

24:21.300 --> 24:24.820
You got a small business, you're growing, you want to give a couple employees some phones,

24:24.820 --> 24:25.820
$6 a month.

24:25.820 --> 24:29.020
$6 a month for a phone and then your usage on top of that.

24:29.020 --> 24:31.580
Ting just takes your minutes, your messages, your megabytes, you add them up and that's

24:31.580 --> 24:32.580
what you pay.

24:32.580 --> 24:33.580
It's simple.

24:33.580 --> 24:34.580
It's straightforward.

24:34.580 --> 24:35.580
There's no contract.

24:35.580 --> 24:36.580
It's easy.

24:36.580 --> 24:37.580
And the best part?

24:37.580 --> 24:40.100
CDMA and GSM networks to work with.

24:40.100 --> 24:43.020
So whatever you got, you're likely going to bring over to Ting.

24:43.020 --> 24:44.900
Just check their BYOD page.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.940
It'll give you all the details you need.

24:46.940 --> 24:49.840
You bring it over to Ting, you get a $25 service credit.

24:49.840 --> 24:54.780
The reason why that's great, average Ting line, $23 a month once you include the line

24:54.780 --> 24:55.780
cost and the minutes.

24:55.780 --> 24:59.300
So if you get a $25 service credit, it pays for more than the first month.

24:59.300 --> 25:02.060
Maybe you don't have a phone that you're going to bring, like you need a new phone.

25:02.060 --> 25:03.060
What?

25:03.060 --> 25:04.060
Then you get $25 off your first device, Wes.

25:04.060 --> 25:05.060
Whoa.

25:05.060 --> 25:06.060
That's right.

25:06.060 --> 25:07.060
Linux.Ting.com.

25:07.060 --> 25:11.460
Big thank you to Ting for not only making wireless not suck so bad, but also for supporting

25:11.460 --> 25:12.460
the show for so damn long.

25:12.460 --> 25:13.460
Yeah.

25:13.460 --> 25:16.300
But really the first thing is even more important, honestly, because wireless is the worst.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.460
Also happy America birthday up to our friends in Canada.

25:18.460 --> 25:19.460
Linux.Ting.com.

25:19.460 --> 25:20.460
You hear that party out there?

25:20.460 --> 25:21.460
Oh, yeah.

25:21.460 --> 25:22.460
They're having a party out there.

25:22.460 --> 25:23.460
Well, we left, so they're now kicking it.

25:23.460 --> 25:24.460
Well, and there's booze and there's food.

25:24.460 --> 25:25.460
I mean, there is a party.

25:25.460 --> 25:26.460
Yeah.

25:26.460 --> 25:27.460
Let's hurry up and finish.

25:27.460 --> 25:28.460
XDA has announced they're beginning regular PC hardware coverage, designed for quote-unquote

25:28.460 --> 25:39.300
their audience, which I think means the Jupiter Broadcasting audience, and they go through

25:39.300 --> 25:44.740
some recent comments they've had about some of their articles that they were kind of preemptively

25:44.740 --> 25:48.860
planning this, and they're like, let's test out this material and see how it works here.

25:48.860 --> 25:52.260
And so they published a few articles, and the comments are like, do more of this.

25:52.260 --> 25:54.700
Yes, please get more into computer hardware.

25:54.700 --> 25:57.540
And they say at the time, we didn't mention that we were kind of considering this, and

25:57.540 --> 25:59.220
we were monitoring the feedback.

25:59.220 --> 26:03.540
And I love what they say they're going to cover, because they're so brilliant about

26:03.540 --> 26:07.980
it, because they say XDA has traditionally covered mobile devices, but how do you make

26:07.980 --> 26:10.980
all these apps and OSes for these mobile devices?

26:10.980 --> 26:12.780
You have to use great PC hardware.

26:12.780 --> 26:13.780
Exactly.

26:13.780 --> 26:16.780
And there's that link, right, between – I mean, I think there's a lot of people who

26:16.780 --> 26:20.540
get into Linux because they want to mess with Android ROMs whenever it turns out, hey, Linux

26:20.540 --> 26:22.620
and open source is the best way to get started with that.

26:22.620 --> 26:23.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:23.620 --> 26:25.940
Well, and so they say like – so here's the logic.

26:25.940 --> 26:29.900
They say after two months of working behind the scenes, we're ready to say it, XDA will

26:29.900 --> 26:33.180
start covering PC hardware on a regular basis.

26:33.180 --> 26:37.160
And if you dig down a little bit, they talk about the type of hardware they're going

26:37.160 --> 26:38.220
to be covering.

26:38.220 --> 26:42.540
They say reviews will largely focus on the Linux operating system and continue to have

26:42.540 --> 26:44.900
a developer focus in them.

26:44.900 --> 26:48.460
We decided to keep our reviews on Linux for two primary reasons.

26:48.460 --> 26:50.980
Oh, I love it.

26:50.980 --> 26:53.300
Okay, number one.

26:53.300 --> 26:57.900
First up was the lack of dedicated Linux coverage for new PC hardware in the global market.

26:57.900 --> 27:01.500
We hope that this will help introduce – what's that word right there, Wes?

27:01.500 --> 27:02.500
Cooperation?

27:02.500 --> 27:03.500
I don't know that.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.500
I don't know what that is.

27:04.500 --> 27:05.500
What's that?

27:05.500 --> 27:06.500
I don't think that's something we do down here in the States.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.500
Is that – no.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.500
No, I'm not familiar with that.

27:08.500 --> 27:11.380
Is that something where you fight other people and then whoever wins –

27:11.380 --> 27:13.740
It's just another word for argument.

27:13.740 --> 27:14.740
Okay, okay.

27:14.740 --> 27:15.740
Okay.

27:15.740 --> 27:17.620
They're going to – anyways, they're going to take that and they're going to work with

27:17.620 --> 27:19.260
other people and do Linux reviews.

27:19.260 --> 27:20.660
I don't understand that part of it.

27:20.660 --> 27:24.840
But what they go on to say is there's not really many competitors and they address this

27:24.840 --> 27:26.500
directly beyond Ferronix.

27:26.500 --> 27:28.260
That caught my attention there.

27:28.260 --> 27:33.620
The other half, by the way, is one that we have had – here's what they say.

27:33.620 --> 27:38.260
A lack of information on how to get most PC hardware working on the day of release.

27:38.260 --> 27:43.180
As part of our reviews, we'll be including notes on any issues using hardware with Linux

27:43.180 --> 27:46.220
as well as any solutions and workarounds available.

27:46.220 --> 27:48.840
You know, I hadn't really thought of it until this article but you're right, there kind

27:48.840 --> 27:50.060
of is that gap.

27:50.060 --> 27:53.900
We talk a lot about software, releases, those kind of things, but you're on – by and

27:53.900 --> 27:56.980
large, I mean, yeah, you might have some Ferronix articles, maybe there's an ArchWiki entry

27:56.980 --> 27:59.620
for your laptop, but hardware is kind of neglected.

27:59.620 --> 28:02.060
It's like, well, just go to the regular PC hardware news.

28:02.060 --> 28:03.060
You'll be fine for that.

28:03.060 --> 28:04.060
Yeah.

28:04.060 --> 28:06.180
Yeah, so I've been talking with Daniel Moran and he'll – I think that's how you say

28:06.180 --> 28:07.180
his last name.

28:07.180 --> 28:10.180
He'll be doing the writing over there and he's available on Twitter.

28:10.180 --> 28:12.900
I have him linked in the show notes and he's pretty excited about it.

28:12.900 --> 28:17.620
I think he's got a good vision about what he wants to do with it and it's not going

28:17.620 --> 28:19.180
to be exactly what Ferronix does.

28:19.180 --> 28:22.980
It will be somewhat competition in that space but I think it's going to be also more like

28:22.980 --> 28:27.260
here's first day release of this new piece of hardware that everybody is talking about

28:27.260 --> 28:31.780
and here's how it actually works today on Linux and if you really got to use it, here's

28:31.780 --> 28:34.860
the couple of things you have to modify or tweak to make it work.

28:34.860 --> 28:35.860
Awesome.

28:35.860 --> 28:36.860
Yeah.

28:36.860 --> 28:37.860
Yeah.

28:37.860 --> 28:40.900
Yeah, that's the kind of stuff that Windows users typically get to enjoy and they talk

28:40.900 --> 28:41.900
about that too.

28:41.900 --> 28:44.620
They say, well, look, there's tons of other people that are doing Windows coverage.

28:44.620 --> 28:45.620
Right.

28:45.620 --> 28:48.640
And like before, we've been kind of left waiting like, OK, well, I hope someone buys

28:48.640 --> 28:52.220
that laptop and writes a blog post sometime in the next six months because otherwise how

28:52.220 --> 28:53.220
will I know?

28:53.220 --> 28:54.220
Yeah.

28:54.220 --> 28:59.100
I hope that somebody who's on like Planet Gnome or something, the blogs, writes about

28:59.100 --> 29:01.980
buying this thing and they fix it.

29:01.980 --> 29:04.340
Yeah, that's exactly it.

29:04.340 --> 29:10.180
So I'm actually super glad that Wimpy is here because I hadn't even planned on having the

29:10.180 --> 29:13.340
expertise of Mr. Martin Wimpers for this next story.

29:13.340 --> 29:17.980
But Joey over at OMG Ubuntu has an article on the new software boutique app that's going

29:17.980 --> 29:20.740
to ship in Ubuntu Mate 17.10.

29:20.740 --> 29:25.500
Couple of things I noticed that jump out at me, Wimpy, is it looks like some of the Mate

29:25.500 --> 29:28.620
branding has been stripped from this.

29:28.620 --> 29:32.620
More theming support has been added and snap support.

29:32.620 --> 29:36.260
It kind of feels like this is starting to be positioned as any distro could use this

29:36.260 --> 29:37.260
thing.

29:37.260 --> 29:38.260
Hopefully.

29:38.260 --> 29:39.260
Yeah.

29:39.260 --> 29:42.620
We're using all the right technologies for that to become a thing.

29:42.620 --> 29:49.020
We're obviously going to be developing it to hit the 17.10 release deadlines and it

29:49.020 --> 29:52.100
will be squarely aimed at doing what Ubuntu Mate needs.

29:52.100 --> 29:57.660
But because we're going to be using a snapdglib, which is the library to do all of the snap

29:57.660 --> 30:05.340
stuff and then package kit now for the traditional repository installs, it could potentially

30:05.340 --> 30:06.940
work anywhere.

30:06.940 --> 30:09.940
So decoupling software boutique has several advantages.

30:09.940 --> 30:12.900
It can be installed and used in other distros.

30:12.900 --> 30:17.980
Software boutique and Ubuntu Mate welcome use and use fewer system resources and software

30:17.980 --> 30:22.060
boutique will dynamically adapt to the currently selected theme to better fit in with your

30:22.060 --> 30:23.060
preferred look and feel.

30:23.060 --> 30:26.340
So I didn't realize this before, Wimpy, because I've always used it after immediate

30:26.340 --> 30:30.780
installation but did the software boutique not follow my desktop theme in the past?

30:30.780 --> 30:37.060
Well, it did in the usual places but then within the application itself, it has its

30:37.060 --> 30:43.340
own CSS to style it and it didn't take any cues from, or it didn't take many cues from

30:43.340 --> 30:50.620
the theme that you actually had running to, you know, blend in and it will do that now.

30:50.620 --> 30:52.400
Oh, I see.

30:52.400 --> 30:55.020
So can you give me a little peek behind the curtain?

30:55.020 --> 30:57.460
Like are you doing the work on this?

30:57.460 --> 31:00.200
Are you paying somebody to do the work on this?

31:00.200 --> 31:03.820
How are they getting paid and that kind of stuff?

31:03.820 --> 31:09.580
So most of this work is – well, all the front-end work is being done by Luke Corwell

31:09.580 --> 31:11.580
who is a contributor to Ubuntu Mate.

31:11.580 --> 31:12.580
Yeah.

31:12.580 --> 31:13.580
We've talked about him before.

31:13.580 --> 31:14.580
Definitely.

31:14.580 --> 31:15.580
Yeah.

31:15.580 --> 31:18.700
He's responsible for all the cool stuff you see in Ubuntu Mate welcome and the software

31:18.700 --> 31:26.860
boutique and if you use Razer peripherals, you are probably using his other project which

31:26.860 --> 31:31.940
is called Polychromatic which is the tool to do all of the RGB configuration.

31:31.940 --> 31:32.940
Cool.

31:32.940 --> 31:33.940
Okay.

31:33.940 --> 31:39.740
Well, what a gentleman because this is one of my favorite, favorite experiences on Ubuntu

31:39.740 --> 31:40.740
Mate.

31:40.740 --> 31:46.140
Like I honestly would – for internal uses, it has tipped the scale in the past to know

31:46.140 --> 31:49.620
that I could – you log in after your first log in.

31:49.620 --> 31:55.180
You run this thing and now with the cued installations, you just go through and all of the great applications

31:55.180 --> 31:56.380
for Linux are in here.

31:56.380 --> 32:01.660
It's one of those things that makes me actually think, okay, I could install this on someone.

32:01.660 --> 32:05.100
I was setting them up on Linux for the first time and I wouldn't have to be there and

32:05.100 --> 32:06.100
walk them through.

32:06.100 --> 32:08.060
I could just give them this and be like, call me when you have problems.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.060
Yeah.

32:09.060 --> 32:12.460
Even on systems where I've run the Unity desktop, I've still got out of my way to

32:12.460 --> 32:13.460
install it.

32:13.460 --> 32:14.460
Yeah, right?

32:14.460 --> 32:15.460
Why not?

32:15.460 --> 32:16.460
Boom.

32:16.460 --> 32:17.460
We hear that a lot from people.

32:17.460 --> 32:22.100
We hear a lot that people install welcome on other Ubuntu flavors just to get the boutique.

32:22.100 --> 32:24.260
So there are other advantages for us.

32:24.260 --> 32:27.540
It's easier to maintain the boutique when it's decoupled from welcome.

32:27.540 --> 32:31.660
So I don't know how much you can say but I – if a great software –

32:31.660 --> 32:32.660
Well, it's open source.

32:32.660 --> 32:33.660
I can tell you whatever you want to know.

32:33.660 --> 32:38.620
Well, so if a great software project like this comes along that happens to hit things

32:38.620 --> 32:46.420
like snap packages, happens to have an apt, get back in, happens to use PPAs, what could

32:46.420 --> 32:50.420
I as a user do to let Canonical know that I would be interested in actually having that

32:50.420 --> 32:56.140
ship in mainline Ubuntu GNOME like the standard Ubuntu desktop starting with 1710 and beyond?

32:56.140 --> 32:58.740
What could I do as a user to voice that opinion?

32:58.740 --> 33:02.400
That's a very good question and I don't know the answer to that.

33:02.400 --> 33:06.060
It seems like – I mean I know maybe 1710, that's too soon.

33:06.060 --> 33:09.060
But in the LTS, what a piece of software.

33:09.060 --> 33:13.500
You give folks an entirely new desktop environment but you give them this guide to get their

33:13.500 --> 33:17.780
whereabouts, to get their bearings and get to the applications that they use and know.

33:17.780 --> 33:22.380
It seems like it's that perfect kind of – I know this is new but this will help

33:22.380 --> 33:28.060
and even just ironing out – I mean GNOME software is great and actually that is getting

33:28.060 --> 33:29.060
pretty good.

33:29.060 --> 33:30.060
It is getting better, yeah.

33:30.060 --> 33:33.900
But just ironing out that extra little bit of friction would be really nice and a totally

33:33.900 --> 33:34.900
new desktop environment.

33:34.900 --> 33:39.660
I'd like to see we set the same person down in front of clean Windows laptop, clean Linux

33:39.660 --> 33:40.660
laptop.

33:40.660 --> 33:41.660
You got this.

33:41.660 --> 33:42.660
You got the Windows Store.

33:42.660 --> 33:43.660
Have at it.

33:43.660 --> 33:44.660
Where are you going to be in a day?

33:44.660 --> 33:45.660
We should bring Will on.

33:45.660 --> 33:46.660
I'm going to try to get Will Cook.

33:46.660 --> 33:48.940
I'm going to ask him because I really want this.

33:48.940 --> 33:52.660
It's so great that I install it even on mainline Ubuntu desktop.

33:52.660 --> 33:53.660
Oh, yeah.

33:53.660 --> 33:54.660
Why not?

33:54.660 --> 33:55.660
Yeah.

33:55.660 --> 34:00.380
So we did a lot of this work at the Snap Sprint last week and Will Cook was there as were

34:00.380 --> 34:07.260
as Popey said earlier people from KDE and Fedora and elementary and there were a couple

34:07.260 --> 34:11.820
of breakout sessions in the week where we have coffee and we all sat around and showed

34:11.820 --> 34:13.180
each other our wares.

34:13.180 --> 34:18.500
The KDE guys have added – well, they had Snap support in their store but they had written

34:18.500 --> 34:23.780
their own interface for Snaps and they've now used Snap DGLib and it's cute wrappers

34:23.780 --> 34:27.780
and they were showing us all of the new stuff that they'd added as a result of making

34:27.780 --> 34:28.780
that transition.

34:28.780 --> 34:32.660
So we're all doing a little bit of show and tell and everyone was looking at what

34:32.660 --> 34:36.460
the new stuff in GNOME software is, what's new in KDE and they were all looking over

34:36.460 --> 34:41.820
our shoulder at what is a very embryonic software boutique to see what we were up to.

34:41.820 --> 34:45.140
It's kind of fun comparing notes and seeing how we're going about stuff.

34:45.140 --> 34:46.140
I love it.

34:46.140 --> 34:52.180
I didn't realize – has Canonical always ran this many sprints or is this something

34:52.180 --> 34:54.660
that's picked up in the last year?

34:54.660 --> 34:59.580
Well you might remember about this time last year, I was at a Snappy Sprint in Germany

34:59.580 --> 35:04.900
and that was quite a big – and this was like the continuation of that effort but it

35:04.900 --> 35:07.900
was a much smaller focus group.

35:07.900 --> 35:12.960
I think there was about 30 people in total at this one and this one was more about doing

35:12.960 --> 35:16.520
rather than making decisions and drawing up plans.

35:16.520 --> 35:21.720
So these were – not that we've already decided we're going to do these things,

35:21.720 --> 35:23.160
now how do we go about doing it?

35:23.160 --> 35:26.420
And for some of us we spent the week kicking out a lot of code.

35:26.420 --> 35:27.980
The great unblocking festival.

35:27.980 --> 35:28.980
Yeah, right?

35:28.980 --> 35:33.500
Doesn't it just sort of kick everything through and you make serious progress?

35:33.500 --> 35:34.500
It's fascinating.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.500
Yeah.

35:35.500 --> 35:40.020
I mean for Luke and I, this was something that we wanted to work on for ages and it

35:40.020 --> 35:43.760
gave us a week to actually – and it's the first time we've met in person.

35:43.760 --> 35:47.060
So it actually gave us a week to like work on this stuff and actually make the progress

35:47.060 --> 35:52.520
we needed to do to sort of kick this in a new direction because Luke has decoupled

35:52.520 --> 35:54.300
Boutique months ago.

35:54.300 --> 35:56.220
We just haven't had the time to work on it.

35:56.220 --> 35:57.820
Oh, I didn't realize that.

35:57.820 --> 36:00.740
I did not – I thought that was a recent thing.

36:00.740 --> 36:05.340
Well, we announced it recently but Luke started this work maybe six months ago.

36:05.340 --> 36:06.340
Sure.

36:06.340 --> 36:07.340
Wow.

36:07.340 --> 36:08.340
Wow.

36:08.340 --> 36:09.340
So this is something you've been thinking about for a while.

36:09.340 --> 36:10.340
Yeah.

36:10.340 --> 36:11.340
Smart.

36:11.340 --> 36:18.340
I hope it takes off because it's such a great user experience and I really – I don't

36:18.340 --> 36:22.340
know how much emphasis and underscore and exclamation marks I can put on this.

36:22.340 --> 36:27.020
But as somebody who is feeling back through his years of trying to use Linux in the corporate

36:27.020 --> 36:31.580
space and trying to use Linux as a creator and trying to use Linux as a small business

36:31.580 --> 36:37.100
owner and trying to use Linux as a father with photos, like all of these things, I come

36:37.100 --> 36:40.460
with the weight of saying this makes a difference.

36:40.460 --> 36:45.540
And it seems – it's like one of those things that's so obvious but I want to – so

36:45.540 --> 36:48.940
I want to go to the rooftops and I want to shout it around and say make everything better

36:48.940 --> 36:49.940
with this.

36:49.940 --> 36:50.940
Yeah.

36:50.940 --> 36:53.740
Well, and it's like we – it seems like the time is ripe in many ways with the Windows

36:53.740 --> 36:56.060
Store and everything that Apple has been doing.

36:56.060 --> 36:57.060
Right?

36:57.060 --> 37:00.460
Like consumers are now expecting this sort of model but the traditional workflows we

37:00.460 --> 37:04.420
have for – we have the package management and those systems and all of that.

37:04.420 --> 37:08.540
But something that says this is really the best of the best that you can hit one button

37:08.540 --> 37:13.940
and have it installed at links and icons are here and it's just great.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.840
And it does all the PPA math for you.

37:15.840 --> 37:18.080
It does all of the snap math for you.

37:18.080 --> 37:22.100
It just handles all of that and gives it to you in a cute interface where you can go check,

37:22.100 --> 37:25.820
check, check, check, check, check, check, boom, go, make my system usable.

37:25.820 --> 37:31.780
And one new feature is we're going to retain that curated list of the hundred or so applications

37:31.780 --> 37:37.460
and we've had a search facility in the boutique for a while but it's only ever searched its

37:37.460 --> 37:38.460
contents.

37:38.460 --> 37:44.620
Now when you run a search it will query the entire archive and the Snap Store.

37:44.620 --> 37:48.900
So what you see in the boutique is just the stuff we're recommending but when you search

37:48.900 --> 37:51.980
for stuff it will interrogate everything it's got access to.

37:51.980 --> 37:52.980
Smart.

37:52.980 --> 37:56.220
So any Snap package that's been submitted since that thing's been released will be

37:56.220 --> 37:57.700
available in the search.

37:57.700 --> 37:58.700
Yep.

37:58.700 --> 37:59.700
Wow.

37:59.700 --> 38:03.540
So that's like the critical momentum pieces for Snaps and the whole ecosystem it feels

38:03.540 --> 38:09.940
like that suddenly it's cohesive now, it's thought out, it's well rounded.

38:09.940 --> 38:13.260
So let's talk about kind of related to this is package kit.

38:13.260 --> 38:18.780
Now if I say package kit, you probably think that thing I think Fedora uses, well it turns

38:18.780 --> 38:20.660
out a lot more than just Fedora uses it.

38:20.660 --> 38:25.740
Pretty much all Linux that I use it, it is – think of it as an API that sits on top

38:25.740 --> 38:27.320
of your package manager.

38:27.320 --> 38:31.740
So at some point in time people came together and said, I want to write something like Gnome

38:31.740 --> 38:37.420
Software or Neon Discover or whatever and I don't want to – or KD Discover.

38:37.420 --> 38:44.180
And I don't want to have to write a version for DNF – I'm sorry YUM then DNF for Pacman,

38:44.180 --> 38:45.180
for APT.

38:45.180 --> 38:47.020
You want one API that you can write to.

38:47.020 --> 38:48.020
Yeah.

38:48.020 --> 38:49.020
And so that was the idea of package kit.

38:49.020 --> 38:52.100
You can actually use it as a command line tool as well which is kind of nice because

38:52.100 --> 38:56.020
you can bounce around distros and use the same package kit commands to install software.

38:56.020 --> 38:57.020
Hey oh.

38:57.020 --> 38:58.020
Yeah.

38:58.020 --> 39:00.660
So there is some real like worthwhile investment here in package kit.

39:00.660 --> 39:07.500
However, right now – and these things always change but right now package kit on Fedora

39:07.500 --> 39:09.340
is not in a great space.

39:09.340 --> 39:11.660
And so – and I think this isn't a big deal.

39:11.660 --> 39:16.340
DNF is great and Fedora users aren't like married to Gnome Software.

39:16.340 --> 39:25.940
But it relies right now on a library libdnf, pretty sexy name really, that is pretty new.

39:25.940 --> 39:29.780
And they've just recently ported it from Python to C. So like when I say it's new,

39:29.780 --> 39:33.900
it's like not only is it kind of new but they've also just ported it to C kind of

39:33.900 --> 39:34.900
new.

39:34.900 --> 39:36.740
So it's all kinds of new.

39:36.740 --> 39:41.740
And they actually say in the read me they say libdnf is not currently – I'm sorry

39:41.740 --> 39:45.380
is currently being reworked and is considered unstable.

39:45.380 --> 39:49.780
Once major users like package kit and DNF are fully ported, a new stable release will

39:49.780 --> 39:50.780
be considered.

39:50.780 --> 39:55.340
In other words, Gnome Software and Plasma Discover, two front end center applications

39:55.340 --> 40:00.140
for end users of Fedora workstations, especially Gnome Software, rely on unfinished work in

40:00.140 --> 40:02.500
progress in Fedora.

40:02.500 --> 40:09.180
It's worth noting that both Pacman and the app backends like the one for Ubuntu are in

40:09.180 --> 40:10.980
a much better shape.

40:10.980 --> 40:12.460
I think that highlights the whole thing here, right?

40:12.460 --> 40:16.100
Like the value proposition is that you're pushing this off to some middle layer and

40:16.100 --> 40:20.460
you – what you can do is only as good as the binding between you and what the end system

40:20.460 --> 40:21.460
is.

40:21.460 --> 40:22.460
Well, and you know what?

40:22.460 --> 40:24.380
DNF is newer than app or Pacman.

40:24.380 --> 40:29.460
And so they just – that middleman layer hasn't been finished yet and that's really

40:29.460 --> 40:30.740
the problem.

40:30.740 --> 40:33.780
And you wonder like, OK, well, how bad is it?

40:33.780 --> 40:34.780
Because that was my consideration.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.100
Like how bad is it?

40:36.100 --> 40:38.940
Well, actually it's pretty shit actually to tell you the truth.

40:38.940 --> 40:39.940
I was pretty surprised.

40:39.940 --> 40:42.420
Like I wasn't going to cover it on the show but then I realized how shit it was.

40:42.420 --> 40:43.900
I was about to say, is there a story here?

40:43.900 --> 40:44.900
No, yeah.

40:44.900 --> 40:45.900
Yeah, there is.

40:45.900 --> 40:47.680
So libdnf doesn't support delta RPMs.

40:47.680 --> 40:50.820
So if you're on a mobile connection, go screw yourself.

40:50.820 --> 40:55.820
So libdnf just totally ignores etcdnf.conf – etcdnf slash dnf slash –

40:55.820 --> 40:58.020
That's where I put the conf I don't want to use, Chris.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.020
Right.

40:59.020 --> 41:03.340
So like where you maybe turn on automatic fast mirror selection, package exclusions,

41:03.340 --> 41:04.340
controlling network utilization.

41:04.340 --> 41:05.340
Nope, sorry.

41:05.340 --> 41:07.740
Libdnf ignores all of that.

41:07.740 --> 41:13.460
Also, it doesn't uninstall things properly and it can leave orphan packages behind.

41:13.460 --> 41:16.620
When you uninstall software, it won't necessarily clean things up.

41:16.620 --> 41:17.900
Oh, that's less than desirable.

41:17.900 --> 41:22.700
Yeah, it also lacks safeguards to prevent users from uninstalling crucial software such

41:22.700 --> 41:30.420
as glibc, dnf itself, also libdnf itself can be uninstalled via package kit, and other

41:30.420 --> 41:34.940
things that can cause complete devastation on your system.

41:34.940 --> 41:40.540
Now these are not total likely scenarios but it's a bit of a shit show right now.

41:40.540 --> 41:45.880
It's kind of amateur hour and, you know, full disclosure, they say that in the readme

41:45.880 --> 41:46.880
for libdnf.

41:46.880 --> 41:47.880
They say it's not ready yet.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.060
So it's not like this is a surprise here.

41:50.060 --> 41:54.060
But if you're using gnome software or other graphical managers, you may like you might

41:54.060 --> 41:55.980
just not have any expectation, right?

41:55.980 --> 41:58.860
If it works so well, works just fine on apt or sure.

41:58.860 --> 42:01.620
Well, here's what I Yeah, especially if you're coming from Ubuntu and you're trying out fedora,

42:01.620 --> 42:04.900
you don't even consider the fact that it might be talking a totally different language.

42:04.900 --> 42:09.540
Here's Chris's recommendation, and this is really gonna, this is gonna be fine.

42:09.540 --> 42:13.180
If you want to discover software via gnome software, if you want to discover something

42:13.180 --> 42:16.580
new and install it, you're gonna you're gonna be fine.

42:16.580 --> 42:20.020
Maybe just do your updates from the command line or using the fedora.

42:20.020 --> 42:21.020
That's not available anymore.

42:21.020 --> 42:23.980
Just use your just use just do dnf update and upgrade.

42:23.980 --> 42:28.860
Just do that because dnf will do on the command line, it will do delta packages, it'll also

42:28.860 --> 42:32.360
under and when you uninstall software, just use dnf from the command line.

42:32.360 --> 42:35.740
The command line syntax for dnf is exceptionally simple.

42:35.740 --> 42:40.300
So I normally wouldn't say like, go to the terminal, but dnf is like simple human readable

42:40.300 --> 42:41.300
commands.

42:41.300 --> 42:44.300
Here's the problem with dnf though, when you tell someone to use it, they're gonna ask

42:44.300 --> 42:46.380
you what it stands for.

42:46.380 --> 42:47.560
What does I don't remember anymore.

42:47.560 --> 42:48.560
What does it stand for?

42:48.560 --> 42:49.560
Do you remember?

42:49.560 --> 42:51.740
Does anybody in the mumble room remember what dnf stands for?

42:51.740 --> 42:54.380
I thought it was something kind of womp womp.

42:54.380 --> 42:55.460
Kind of meh.

42:55.460 --> 42:57.660
Like does not stand for much.

42:57.660 --> 42:58.660
Dandified yum.

42:58.660 --> 42:59.660
Oh, it's down.

42:59.660 --> 43:00.660
Oh, okay.

43:00.660 --> 43:01.660
That's what Yeah, of course.

43:01.660 --> 43:02.660
Yum.

43:02.660 --> 43:03.660
Right.

43:03.660 --> 43:04.660
Right.

43:04.660 --> 43:05.660
Of course.

43:05.660 --> 43:06.660
Of course.

43:06.660 --> 43:07.660
Were you gonna say that w w?

43:07.660 --> 43:11.820
It's usually do did not finish in other Oh, yeah, that's no dude.

43:11.820 --> 43:12.820
That's lib dnf.

43:12.820 --> 43:18.660
Yeah, which is back Yeah, yeah, you know, it's just something to know about.

43:18.660 --> 43:21.820
I don't think anybody listening to this shows using package kit in the command line.

43:21.820 --> 43:26.020
If you're just adding new applications from either goo either plasma discover like an

43:26.020 --> 43:28.300
API type, you know, yeah.

43:28.300 --> 43:30.260
And probably by fedora 28.

43:30.260 --> 43:32.300
This isn't going to be an issue anymore.

43:32.300 --> 43:37.820
This blog post over at control dot blog, wow, what a great frickin domain name, control

43:37.820 --> 43:40.660
dot blog, which I have linked in the show notes.

43:40.660 --> 43:44.420
It talks about how 26 and 27 are gonna have a problem, but by 28, this should be this

43:44.420 --> 43:47.340
should not really be a problem anymore.

43:47.340 --> 43:48.620
But it is interesting.

43:48.620 --> 43:52.420
Like you said, it is interesting because we kind of think we talk a lot about there's

43:52.420 --> 43:56.140
a common there's a common conception and this is gonna actually come into what we're about

43:56.140 --> 44:01.020
to talk about that Linux is all kind of the same.

44:01.020 --> 44:05.220
You know, you can use different distros, you can use pop OS, you can use Ubuntu, no, but

44:05.220 --> 44:06.820
it's all kind of the same thing.

44:06.820 --> 44:11.660
You can use Ubuntu Mate, you can use Ubuntu XFCE, you could use Ubuntu Studio, all kind

44:11.660 --> 44:13.060
of the same.

44:13.060 --> 44:15.980
And then when you switch over to something else, you know, you get the gnome desktop

44:15.980 --> 44:18.580
on fedora, you're like, Oh, this is kind of the same.

44:18.580 --> 44:25.180
And there actually can be huge, really, really like screw your disrupt differences in things

44:25.180 --> 44:28.060
like package kit and what and other things.

44:28.060 --> 44:31.700
And I actually think that's a that's an interesting topic to consider as we're about to go into

44:31.700 --> 44:33.260
our next thing.

44:33.260 --> 44:35.080
Yeah, you're absolutely right about that.

44:35.080 --> 44:42.300
So this week, I don't know, I almost feel like I almost feel like a sec if you need

44:42.300 --> 44:43.300
do you think?

44:43.300 --> 44:44.300
Yeah, that's fine.

44:44.300 --> 44:45.300
Do you think so?

44:45.300 --> 44:47.780
Because I almost feel like I almost feel like I can start to see if I can, my heart rate

44:47.780 --> 44:48.780
just jumped up.

44:48.780 --> 44:50.340
Like I'm starting to get a little upset.

44:50.340 --> 44:51.340
Could you see that?

44:51.340 --> 44:52.340
Scoot back?

44:52.340 --> 44:54.780
Because there's no video but you like the Westpane like theater of the mind.

44:54.780 --> 44:56.380
Do you see me starting to get a little better right now?

44:56.380 --> 44:57.380
Yeah, I'll get a little upset.

44:57.380 --> 44:58.380
All right.

44:58.380 --> 44:59.380
Okay.

44:59.380 --> 45:00.380
Let's take a second here.

45:00.380 --> 45:02.820
Let's take a deep breath.

45:02.820 --> 45:03.820
Let's talk about digital ocean.

45:03.820 --> 45:04.820
That's that's a good idea.

45:04.820 --> 45:05.820
You're right, Wes.

45:05.820 --> 45:06.820
Thank you.

45:06.820 --> 45:07.820
You're right.

45:07.820 --> 45:08.820
Because this is gonna help me.

45:08.820 --> 45:09.820
This is just something that makes us all happy.

45:09.820 --> 45:11.260
Focus on something that makes us happy.

45:11.260 --> 45:12.940
Digital Ocean is so great.

45:12.940 --> 45:13.940
DigitalOcean.com.

45:13.940 --> 45:18.500
Go over there, create an account and then apply our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

45:18.500 --> 45:19.780
One word after you create the account.

45:19.780 --> 45:20.880
That's all you got to do.

45:20.880 --> 45:22.500
And then you get a $10 credit.

45:22.500 --> 45:23.500
You can spin up a rig.

45:23.500 --> 45:24.500
They have my favorite.

45:24.500 --> 45:27.100
It's not even the most expensive or the cheapest.

45:27.100 --> 45:28.700
But they have a three cents an hour rig.

45:28.700 --> 45:30.500
It's kind of like right there in the middle.

45:30.500 --> 45:34.260
And the things you can do for three cents an hour, it's crazy.

45:34.260 --> 45:38.620
DigitalOcean is the simple, easiest way to spin up some great Linux machines on their

45:38.620 --> 45:40.060
amazing infrastructure.

45:40.060 --> 45:41.620
They have data centers all over the world.

45:41.620 --> 45:45.660
New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Toronto, Germany, India.

45:45.660 --> 45:50.020
And I do prefer San Francisco, but if I'm going to spin up another droplet, I like to

45:50.020 --> 45:52.100
get close to Allen Jude as close as possible.

45:52.100 --> 45:53.100
Oh yeah.

45:53.100 --> 45:54.100
Yeah, so I go to Toronto.

45:54.100 --> 45:55.100
That Toronto data center.

45:55.100 --> 45:56.100
Plus.

45:56.100 --> 45:57.100
Speak and span.

45:57.100 --> 45:58.100
You know what else turns out?

45:58.100 --> 45:59.100
No NSA in Toronto.

45:59.100 --> 46:00.100
No.

46:00.100 --> 46:01.100
Turns out.

46:01.100 --> 46:04.740
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, create a machine on their great infrastructure

46:04.740 --> 46:05.740
in seconds.

46:05.740 --> 46:08.660
It's simple, easy to spin up infrastructure.

46:08.660 --> 46:12.860
FreeBSD is also available, tons of great Linux distributions, and a dashboard that makes

46:12.860 --> 46:14.380
it easy to use.

46:14.380 --> 46:17.220
It's like butter on top of corn on the cob at a barbecue.

46:17.220 --> 46:20.180
DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

46:20.180 --> 46:21.180
And they have a new feature too.

46:21.180 --> 46:24.500
Block, or I'm sorry, they have block storage, but object storage is a new feature.

46:24.500 --> 46:25.740
Oh my gosh, I'm really excited.

46:25.740 --> 46:26.740
And I'm just waiting.

46:26.740 --> 46:27.740
I signed up for the beta.

46:27.740 --> 46:28.740
I haven't heard back yet.

46:28.740 --> 46:29.740
Yeah.

46:29.740 --> 46:30.740
Literally every day I check my email.

46:30.740 --> 46:34.940
See, when you switch over to using something like object storage, it means that you're

46:34.940 --> 46:39.220
even a small application, you're building it in a way that you're going to be able to

46:39.220 --> 46:42.500
use that code base for 10 years.

46:42.500 --> 46:46.980
And the storage aspect of it too is the biggest bet when you're writing something that could

46:46.980 --> 46:51.020
have images or media or anything with rich content.

46:51.020 --> 46:54.100
Object storage is such a game changer.

46:54.100 --> 46:58.100
And it feels like one of the last things to drop here in like, they made a ton of improvements

46:58.100 --> 46:59.100
this year, last year.

46:59.100 --> 47:00.100
Lots, yeah.

47:00.100 --> 47:04.540
One of the last ones that seems to me like they're suddenly, not only is it simple, intuitive,

47:04.540 --> 47:08.420
super easy to use, but they now have basically all the features you could get from any of

47:08.420 --> 47:10.140
the major cloud providers whatsoever.

47:10.140 --> 47:11.800
I mean, they've done the same thing.

47:11.800 --> 47:15.660
With an interface and an API that none of them can even touch.

47:15.660 --> 47:16.660
And it makes such a difference.

47:16.660 --> 47:17.660
Clear upfront prices.

47:17.660 --> 47:20.700
And it's fast and easy to use.

47:20.700 --> 47:24.700
It means that in a moment before a show, before we go live, if we need a little additional

47:24.700 --> 47:25.700
infrastructure.

47:25.700 --> 47:26.700
No problem.

47:26.700 --> 47:27.700
How many times have we done that?

47:27.700 --> 47:28.700
A lot.

47:28.700 --> 47:29.700
A lot.

47:29.700 --> 47:31.780
We've even done on the live stream is like a bit.

47:31.780 --> 47:32.780
Like how long?

47:32.780 --> 47:34.420
How many seconds can we get up new infrastructure?

47:34.420 --> 47:36.460
We spun up like a game server one time.

47:36.460 --> 47:37.460
Yeah.

47:37.460 --> 47:38.460
Whatever you need.

47:38.460 --> 47:39.460
It's so awesome.

47:39.460 --> 47:44.540
So digitalocean.com, go there, create something, and use our promo code DOUNPLUG to get the

47:44.540 --> 47:45.540
credit.

47:45.540 --> 47:49.940
Thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged Program.

47:49.940 --> 47:50.940
I love it.

47:50.940 --> 47:53.420
I love that they're in the background because there's no other show where we've ever had

47:53.420 --> 47:54.420
that.

47:54.420 --> 47:57.420
We could do this more and go, like we've talked about going to a bar.

47:57.420 --> 47:59.500
Yes, a bar would be awesome.

47:59.500 --> 48:00.500
This is fun.

48:00.500 --> 48:02.300
You know, we have a ton of viewers in Utah.

48:02.300 --> 48:03.300
I'll go to Utah.

48:03.300 --> 48:04.300
I know.

48:04.300 --> 48:05.300
No problem.

48:05.300 --> 48:07.660
I'm like, well, if we're going to, we should go to Utah, we're going to do it.

48:07.660 --> 48:11.420
So okay, so there's a lot, there's a lot to cover here.

48:11.420 --> 48:16.260
Let's start with, let's start with Tuxedo.

48:16.260 --> 48:22.220
Tuxedo is a manufacturer of Linux notebooks in, I believe they're based in Germany.

48:22.220 --> 48:24.220
I've never had an opportunity to be a customer.

48:24.220 --> 48:27.500
I've never had an opportunity to interview because there's a bit of a language barrier

48:27.500 --> 48:29.740
and they have a different market.

48:29.740 --> 48:37.420
And today they have announced Tuxedo XFCE, which is their own version of Linux, a distro

48:37.420 --> 48:39.140
respin, if you will.

48:39.140 --> 48:42.780
And they've worked on something like this in the past, but now they're getting really,

48:42.780 --> 48:44.300
really serious about it.

48:44.300 --> 48:46.180
And they say it makes a big difference.

48:46.180 --> 48:50.260
Tuxedo Computers has announced the release of their own highly customized version of

48:50.260 --> 48:51.260
Linux.

48:51.260 --> 48:57.380
Tuxedo's Ubuntu will be its own distribution based on Linux kernel 4.1.1, even though it

48:57.380 --> 49:01.220
is based on Ubuntu 16.04, which does not ship with that kernel.

49:01.220 --> 49:07.140
The kernel is expected to significantly increase battery life compared to Linux Mint, while

49:07.140 --> 49:13.100
the Infinity Book 13 will go from six and a half hours of battery life with their new

49:13.100 --> 49:20.660
magic sauce, special sauce distribution to 12 hours, 12 and a half hours of battery life.

49:20.660 --> 49:21.660
Say that again for me.

49:21.660 --> 49:25.100
12 and a half hours of battery life just by installing their distribution.

49:25.100 --> 49:29.640
You install their distribution of Linux, not that piece of shit Ubuntu, but you install

49:29.640 --> 49:38.420
their special curated spin of XFCE's Ubuntu, and you'll go from a measly, pathetic six

49:38.420 --> 49:40.700
hours to 12 and a half hours of battery life.

49:40.700 --> 49:42.020
Now that's something to brag about.

49:42.020 --> 49:43.020
Yeah.

49:43.020 --> 49:46.740
Also, by the way, XFCE, they say, uses less memory than Unity.

49:46.740 --> 49:50.920
And the most important advantage for Linux beginners, all the necessary drivers and the

49:50.920 --> 49:58.420
latest firmware are already installed, and adjustments have been implemented, quote-unquote.

49:58.420 --> 50:01.740
Tuxedo's Ubuntu now available when you buy a Tuxedo notebook.

50:01.740 --> 50:03.220
Well, I'm looking at them right now.

50:03.220 --> 50:04.220
Are you?

50:04.220 --> 50:05.220
Yeah.

50:05.220 --> 50:06.220
How do they look to you, Wes?

50:06.220 --> 50:08.220
Hey, I mean, not too bad.

50:08.220 --> 50:11.060
Here's one that looks kind of...

50:11.060 --> 50:14.580
I've never tried the Infinity Book, but Wimpy, you had a chance to review it on the Ubuntu

50:14.580 --> 50:16.380
podcast, didn't you?

50:16.380 --> 50:17.460
Yeah, we did.

50:17.460 --> 50:24.220
We reviewed the Infinity Book Pro 13 a few weeks ago, and Marius, who's in the mumble

50:24.220 --> 50:30.700
room from Ubuntu Fun podcast, has also recently reviewed the same unit.

50:30.700 --> 50:31.700
Oh, really?

50:31.700 --> 50:32.700
Oh, great.

50:32.700 --> 50:33.700
This is awesome.

50:33.700 --> 50:34.700
Awesome.

50:34.700 --> 50:35.700
So what were your thoughts?

50:35.700 --> 50:36.700
If you don't mind just sort of the elevator pitch.

50:36.700 --> 50:39.380
And I remember that episode, but I wouldn't mind just a quick recap.

50:39.380 --> 50:44.260
Well, I'm going to skip anything to do with the hardware, because obviously this announcement

50:44.260 --> 50:46.220
is about them making their own distro.

50:46.220 --> 50:47.220
Sure.

50:47.220 --> 50:53.300
And I think this is probably where Marius and I have most opinion.

50:53.300 --> 50:59.580
This is a brave move that they're making, creating their own distribution based on Ubuntu,

50:59.580 --> 51:05.780
because when you receive an Infinity Book or any one of their computers pre-installed

51:05.780 --> 51:12.420
with Ubuntu or one of the Ubuntu flavors, it comes already with the customizations that

51:12.420 --> 51:14.420
they allude to in this announcement.

51:14.420 --> 51:15.420
Okay.

51:15.420 --> 51:18.900
That was my impression, like they've been kind of doing this.

51:18.900 --> 51:19.900
Yeah.

51:19.900 --> 51:25.460
And the problem is, is that, well, one, I can't stand by their claims for the battery

51:25.460 --> 51:31.420
improvements because I didn't see anywhere near that kind of battery endurance.

51:31.420 --> 51:36.220
And my understanding is talking to them, the modifications that they make, specifically

51:36.220 --> 51:44.700
the kernel changes, are to try and improve battery endurance, but that comes at a cost

51:44.700 --> 51:48.180
in that it's effectively a mainline kernel.

51:48.180 --> 51:54.860
So Docker doesn't run properly, LexD doesn't run properly, there's no live kernel patch

51:54.860 --> 52:01.500
for you, and snaps don't work, and a whole lot of other stuff.

52:01.500 --> 52:06.620
So it's kind of, you know, not a very useful Ubuntu experience at that point.

52:06.620 --> 52:09.340
That's something I really hadn't thought of before, but that totally makes sense, is

52:09.340 --> 52:12.860
that, hey, suddenly you've disconnected this kernel.

52:12.860 --> 52:16.140
Normally I think of having a kernel with more features that I'm adding onto from the base,

52:16.140 --> 52:18.820
you know, config profile for a kernel, but here you have something where you have this

52:18.820 --> 52:23.580
user land that expects things in the kernel that you just won't have all of a sudden.

52:23.580 --> 52:24.580
Right.

52:24.580 --> 52:25.580
Right.

52:25.580 --> 52:26.580
Yeah.

52:26.580 --> 52:27.580
Like ZFS modules, for example.

52:27.580 --> 52:28.580
User namespaces, probably.

52:28.580 --> 52:29.580
Oh, geez.

52:29.580 --> 52:33.620
So Marius, does my summary sound familiar?

52:33.620 --> 52:34.660
Pretty much, yeah.

52:34.660 --> 52:40.260
I've been using the Infinity Book Pro for a review for like two months, and even back

52:40.260 --> 52:44.460
then when I was in the show to talk about Magic Device, I was actually using the Infinity

52:44.460 --> 52:50.820
Book Pro, and halfway through the show, the screen went off and I couldn't get it to turn

52:50.820 --> 52:51.820
back on.

52:51.820 --> 52:56.820
I basically did the whole show blind, and I didn't know what to do, and it's basically

52:56.820 --> 53:01.100
one of the aforementioned kernel problems, or problem because they were using the mainline

53:01.100 --> 53:02.340
kernel.

53:02.340 --> 53:03.900
Okay.

53:03.900 --> 53:06.980
So this is not encouraging, then.

53:06.980 --> 53:09.820
Kernel 4.1.1, that must be a typo, right?

53:09.820 --> 53:10.820
Is that a typo?

53:10.820 --> 53:11.820
It's 4.11.

53:11.820 --> 53:12.820
It's what it's referring to.

53:12.820 --> 53:13.820
Okay.

53:13.820 --> 53:14.820
Okay.

53:14.820 --> 53:15.820
Thank you.

53:15.820 --> 53:16.820
Thank you.

53:16.820 --> 53:20.980
So are we just talking about some mindshare here that doesn't really matter?

53:20.980 --> 53:22.620
Is this the market that we're going to?

53:22.620 --> 53:26.420
Would a developer be comfortable enough adding in a different kernel or making some of these

53:26.420 --> 53:27.420
changes?

53:27.420 --> 53:28.420
I mean, okay.

53:28.420 --> 53:32.940
So what if we take a second here and we use the announcement of Pop OS as a lens to look

53:32.940 --> 53:38.060
in this, because so Tuxedo has been doing this now for a little while, as Wimpy just

53:38.060 --> 53:39.060
implied there.

53:39.060 --> 53:40.900
So Tuxedo has been doing – this isn't their first time.

53:40.900 --> 53:44.280
But now they're like serious about it and they're calling it a name and all that.

53:44.280 --> 53:49.820
But does it change your opinion, Wes, when you – specifically because I've talked

53:49.820 --> 53:54.280
about it on UserAir, I've talked about it on Linux Action News, but I have not heard

53:54.280 --> 53:56.140
your thoughts about Pop OS.

53:56.140 --> 54:00.940
Does it change your opinion of their announcement if you think of Pop OS or are we talking about

54:00.940 --> 54:04.740
sort of one and the same here?

54:04.740 --> 54:09.460
You know, there are a lot of similarities there.

54:09.460 --> 54:13.500
Everything – it just makes me think about what the – what's the maintenance burden

54:13.500 --> 54:18.920
going to be and how much is this really the special sauce?

54:18.920 --> 54:22.220
And that's what I've been trying to think about for Pop OS as well.

54:22.220 --> 54:26.220
Is this really – is this the kind of investments that I want to see?

54:26.220 --> 54:30.100
I think System76 has a kind of clear idea as to what they're doing.

54:30.100 --> 54:31.180
I'm not sure yet.

54:31.180 --> 54:34.460
I haven't seen – I haven't really played with it or anything like that.

54:34.460 --> 54:38.580
And so I don't know that much here about Tuxedo comparably.

54:38.580 --> 54:43.540
I can see why a consumer vendor would want that level of control.

54:43.540 --> 54:48.100
But from the Linux advocate side, the Linux power user side, it does – there's a lot

54:48.100 --> 54:52.120
of compromises and there's a lot of this isn't what I want you to focus on for me.

54:52.120 --> 54:55.060
I just want the hardware and that part of the experience to be the priority.

54:55.060 --> 54:57.060
I'll tell you what I see similar here.

54:57.060 --> 54:58.420
And I don't think they are the same thing.

54:58.420 --> 55:02.980
But what I do see similar here is we want to provide something for our customers that

55:02.980 --> 55:03.980
is competitive.

55:03.980 --> 55:09.820
And I believe that is what this is rooted in.

55:09.820 --> 55:12.220
Battery life being an example of that.

55:12.220 --> 55:15.220
I kind of want to run through the Mumble Room really quick and see what everybody thinks.

55:15.220 --> 55:17.700
I have definitely had my opportunity to share my thoughts.

55:17.700 --> 55:21.500
Benton, would you mind sharing what do you think about things like Tuxedo, Zubuntu or

55:21.500 --> 55:22.500
Pop OS?

55:22.500 --> 55:29.460
Are they one and the same and do you – do you have any strong feelings about their announcements?

55:29.460 --> 55:34.060
I haven't really tested them at all.

55:34.060 --> 55:35.060
No, not tested.

55:35.060 --> 55:37.060
But what is your impression just aside from that?

55:37.060 --> 55:38.940
Just new distros coming in.

55:38.940 --> 55:44.620
So here's an idea that I've heard floated around is maybe every OEM should be making

55:44.620 --> 55:46.400
their own distribution.

55:46.400 --> 55:51.140
Perhaps every OEM should be focused on the end user experience and Benton, they think

55:51.140 --> 55:53.620
– here's the theory, Benton.

55:53.620 --> 55:58.400
If every OEM wants to satisfy their customer, they should focus on the experience and ship

55:58.400 --> 56:00.500
their own distribution that enables their hardware.

56:00.500 --> 56:01.500
What do you think of that?

56:01.500 --> 56:07.100
Well, it sounds good if it doesn't break any stuff.

56:07.100 --> 56:14.140
I haven't read about the German distro thing but I heard some stuff about the Pop OS and

56:14.140 --> 56:18.620
for now it's only been to GNOME, it's another teams and stuff.

56:18.620 --> 56:19.620
Yeah.

56:19.620 --> 56:20.620
Yeah, I agree.

56:20.620 --> 56:21.620
From what I've heard.

56:21.620 --> 56:22.620
Yeah.

56:22.620 --> 56:23.620
Yeah.

56:23.620 --> 56:24.620
What about you, Mariusz?

56:24.620 --> 56:25.620
What do you think?

56:25.620 --> 56:30.540
I think it's a great thing if more of companies like Tuxedo or System76 focus on getting their

56:30.540 --> 56:34.900
hardware out of the box, working with the drivers and all this stuff.

56:34.900 --> 56:41.220
But if the experience is like it was for Martin and me with the Tuxedo and Fintech Pro, when

56:41.220 --> 56:45.460
the experience is actually worse than if you put a vanilla Ubuntu on it, then I don't

56:45.460 --> 56:46.460
think you see the point.

56:46.460 --> 56:47.460
Right.

56:47.460 --> 56:48.460
Right.

56:48.460 --> 56:51.060
So what you – I mean, I think to boil down what you said is you just – if that's what

56:51.060 --> 56:54.820
they have to do to make sure that out of the box, when the customer opens the machine,

56:54.820 --> 56:59.860
the Wi-Fi works, the sleep works, the resume works, the video works, that's probably

56:59.860 --> 57:00.860
understandable.

57:00.860 --> 57:01.860
Yeah, definitely.

57:01.860 --> 57:02.860
Yeah.

57:02.860 --> 57:08.220
Well, I can see that they want to ship it out of the box with their logo on the wallpaper

57:08.220 --> 57:09.220
and that's totally fine.

57:09.220 --> 57:10.220
Sure.

57:10.220 --> 57:11.220
But that's not worth a whole OS.

57:11.220 --> 57:12.220
Yeah.

57:12.220 --> 57:13.220
Okay.

57:13.220 --> 57:14.220
Okay.

57:14.220 --> 57:15.220
So it's not worth like a whole OS.

57:15.220 --> 57:16.220
Okay.

57:16.220 --> 57:17.220
Yeah.

57:17.220 --> 57:18.220
Okay.

57:18.220 --> 57:19.220
So JM, did you want to chime in?

57:19.220 --> 57:20.220
Did you have a thought on this?

57:20.220 --> 57:21.220
Yeah.

57:21.220 --> 57:27.700
I had an interview with Ryan Sipes from System76 and he talked a lot about making those last

57:27.700 --> 57:28.700
mile improvements.

57:28.700 --> 57:29.700
Sure.

57:29.700 --> 57:36.060
Which they had a hard time doing while waiting for Canonical to ship new versions of Unity.

57:36.060 --> 57:40.940
I believe his words were, we waited three years for features for our operating system,

57:40.940 --> 57:41.940
right?

57:41.940 --> 57:42.940
Yeah.

57:42.940 --> 57:49.620
And it makes sense for them to do the software and the hardware.

57:49.620 --> 57:54.220
So what do you think, so if I said to you that people were not buying System76 hardware

57:54.220 --> 58:00.900
to get their OS, but they were buying System76 hardware to get the Ubuntu OS, then I think

58:00.900 --> 58:07.500
Ryan's comment in that context doesn't reflect the motivations of their customers and far

58:07.500 --> 58:09.780
be it for me to say what their customers prefer.

58:09.780 --> 58:13.780
But if I was buying a System76 machine, I mean, the point I always made sure to emphasize

58:13.780 --> 58:18.860
for 10 years in the Linux Action Show was System76 machines were born to run Linux or

58:18.860 --> 58:20.660
I'm sorry, born to run Ubuntu.

58:20.660 --> 58:26.660
They run Linux, but they're born to run Ubuntu, i.e. this company has made it their

58:26.660 --> 58:30.780
mission to make sure this thing runs Ubuntu.

58:30.780 --> 58:36.180
And that is why I thought they were a great vendor to sponsor because if you want an out-of-the-box

58:36.180 --> 58:40.420
great Ubuntu experience, then wouldn't it be wonderful if there's this one company

58:40.420 --> 58:44.980
and their sole purpose is making sure that these systems run Ubuntu really well.

58:44.980 --> 58:46.940
They're born to run Ubuntu.

58:46.940 --> 58:50.000
I'm not waiting for System76's features.

58:50.000 --> 58:51.500
I'm not buying a Bonobo.

58:51.500 --> 58:54.740
I'm not buying two Bonobos and a Retel.

58:54.740 --> 59:00.340
I don't buy Oryx because I want System76's features to Ubuntu.

59:00.340 --> 59:05.220
I buy them because I want them to run Ubuntu and mostly, actually, if I'm being honest,

59:05.220 --> 59:07.940
I want them to run the Linux kernel very well.

59:07.940 --> 59:12.300
That's what I want from them and that's why I'm buying them and I really couldn't, to

59:12.300 --> 59:16.740
be honest with you, could not give two shits what features they want to add to the desktop

59:16.740 --> 59:19.380
if they want to put a great theme on it, God bless.

59:19.380 --> 59:20.380
And you know what?

59:20.380 --> 59:21.380
Papa Bless have at it.

59:21.380 --> 59:25.060
I really, I think that's a great idea, but myself, I'm going to format that shit and

59:25.060 --> 59:28.420
I'm going to put Solace or Anagros on it and then I'm going to make it work for me

59:28.420 --> 59:32.740
as a workstation that gets actual work done and I'm not going to care about any pop theme.

59:32.740 --> 59:35.540
I'm not going to care about anything that's a special distribution.

59:35.540 --> 59:40.580
I just want to make sure that this thing runs Linux really well and if I know it runs mainline

59:40.580 --> 59:46.300
good old fashioned Ubuntu, then I know I can get my Arch Kakamani or Fedora shenanigans

59:46.300 --> 59:49.740
working on this thing.

59:49.740 --> 59:58.100
What does it mean to go from changes, maybe even a large amount of changes on top of an

59:58.100 --> 01:00:03.140
OS or distribution, whatever verbiage you want, to do that, to make it your own?

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.140
You know what I mean?

01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:05.140
It seems like we're okay.

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:07.580
We want, we recognize that the mainline won't be enough.

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:08.580
What is it?

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:10.260
A distro versus a fork versus an OS?

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:11.260
Right.

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.260
Clearly there needs to be some customization.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:16.100
There needs to be driver customization or whatever, but what does it mean to change that

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.100
branding?

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.100
What does it mean?

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:20.460
What is that line?

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:25.740
I had a really interesting realization when I visited Dell because I hadn't really ever

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:30.380
gotten inside a company that was selling Linux at a massive scale.

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:35.780
What I realized is at a certain scale, and it's actually less than you would expect,

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:40.660
but at a certain scale, what was explained to me was you are working with Canonical on

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.660
a contractual level.

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:48.940
You get a partnership at some level where there's an agreement to work together.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:49.940
This is official.

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:53.340
It's between two companies and there's money exchanged.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:57.380
In that process, get ready for this one.

01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:00.780
Because I think if you watched our Dell coverage, I think you would have the opinion and the

01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.940
impression that Dell did all of the modifications to Linux.

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:06.820
Dell made the changes to make high DPI work on Linux.

01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:09.540
Dell made the changes to standardize the Ubuntu installer.

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:12.940
Dell made the changes to do an after first boot splash screen.

01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:16.300
You might walk away with the impression that Dell contributed all of that code upstream

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:20.700
and Canonical just fell backwards into adopting it.

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:24.980
While Dell did write some of that code, the reality is, and this is explained to me, and

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:28.580
if anyone from our friends at Canonical wants to correct me, please, because this is just

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:31.420
third hand that I got from Dell.

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:36.100
My understanding is if you sell a certain amount of computers, you become an OEM partner.

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:39.740
By doing so, Canonical does all the heavy lifting for you.

01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:43.380
If you want to have high DPI support, if you want to have special branding, or if you want

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:46.580
to have a special theme, or if you want to have something that works with your wireless

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:52.780
chip that isn't upstream yet, Canonical actually does all of the grunt work to make that code

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:54.140
actually work.

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:58.860
Then they turn it over to you and say, here's your repo, here's your repos, here's your

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:01.380
image, deploy this on the systems.

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:04.620
What Dell has to do is they just have to figure out what hardware they want to ship.

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:09.700
Then they go to a company that their entire job is to make sure that their operating system

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.660
works on your hardware.

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:16.260
Their entire staff is intimately familiar with Ubuntu, and then they make all of the

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:20.460
modifications necessary, and they deliver that end result to their business partner.

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:24.260
In this case, in my experience, it was Dell, and then Dell ships that.

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:28.440
What's beautiful about that is instead of having Dell write software like they used

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:33.500
to for Windows, you actually have the manufacturer of the operating system writing the modifications

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:38.420
necessary to make it work on the OEM hardware.

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:43.180
The concept that every OEM, every Dick and Harry OEM that gets the idea of shipping an

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:49.140
ISO on an x86 box needs to write their own distribution is completely negated when you

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:53.980
realize that if you work at a certain scale and you create a business opportunity with

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:58.460
Canonical, they'll do the work for you, and you can call it Ubuntu legally.

01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.460
Problem solved.

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:04.060
Then your customers that want Ubuntu can buy Ubuntu, it's called Ubuntu, and the software

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:06.340
is developed by Canonical.

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:12.980
And it is much more straightforward than Tuxedo as Ubuntu, or whatever it's going to be called.

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:13.980
What is that?

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:16.560
What are the small scale people do?

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.340
So I'll just chip in and say, yes, there is an OEM team, and you know, that's how that

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:22.820
arrangement works.

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:29.100
My understanding is Ubuntu are not the only distro manufacturer that offers services like

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.100
that.

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:36.700
And, you know, I would suggest that the likes of Tuxedo and maybe System76 as well, consider

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:41.220
what they're going to spend on engineering resources in terms of dollars to actually

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:47.180
pull this off, and whether they do better to actually partner with insert name of distribution

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:53.620
here who can offer those professional services.

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:58.460
So I've not spoken, I think Chris needs to take a breather for a moment.

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:02.000
I do, I appreciate you guys filling in because yeah, I will calm down because this is really

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
upsetting me.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000
I'm not kidding.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.660
I've, I've not spoken to System76, anyone from System76 since the announcement of BobOS.

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:14.720
I don't doubt that I will at some point soon.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:21.620
It feels to me like they, when Canonical made the announcement back in April that we were

01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:26.820
downsizing slightly, and refocusing our attention on different things.

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:30.380
And as a result, the desktop was changing.

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:36.620
I think perhaps from an outsider's point of view, it looked like System76 utterly freaked

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:43.540
out and did what they thought was best for them and their customers.

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:51.140
Now, to be fair, System76 know better what their customers need than anyone else, right?

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:55.940
Because they talk to them every day and their customers give them dollars to make this stuff

01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:56.940
work.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:57.940
And they're super connected too.

01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:00.460
Like they are, they're not like a company that just sort of sells a piece of hardware

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:02.980
and then they just, like they really are good faith.

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.460
Like they have employees who talk to their customers all day every day and they get good

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:09.260
feedback from their customers about what they like and what they don't like.

01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:12.100
And they're getting support calls and they're telling, you know, they're working with these

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:15.180
people and okay, yeah, this is always something we get a call about.

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:16.900
Yeah, here's all you have to do to fix that.

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:18.660
I cannot totally understand that.

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:19.660
Right.

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:26.700
But this is reminding me of something in the IT world that's been happening for years.

01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:33.680
Have we learned nothing from Android where every single manufacturer has their own strange

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:40.020
quirky version of Android that's bastardized from the original and is slightly different

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:47.300
and not well maintained, doesn't get updates and isn't as consistent as all the others.

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:50.380
It's a perfect thing.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:51.420
It sells iPhones.

01:05:51.420 --> 01:05:52.900
It's a road that sells iPhones.

01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:58.780
It's a road that leads to the damn Apple store.

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:03.940
What I see is that I just don't want like, are these upstream chains?

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.860
Are these going to go upstream?

01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:06.860
Any of these gestures?

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:09.300
Are they going to be updating us?

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.780
I suppose.

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:15.280
But you know, so upstream is something that gets tossed around a lot.

01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.260
But let's take a second and talk seriously.

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.140
Let's like, let's be real about it.

01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:24.420
So if you're going to make a modification that works with your limited range of hardware

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:28.340
and then you submit it upstream, there is not a guaranteed chance that's going to

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:29.340
be accepted.

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:33.540
There's no – no one knows what the quality of that code is going to be.

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:40.140
There's no saying how the impact on the overall ecosystem is.

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:45.540
Saying you're going to create something and toss it upstream is not the same as actually

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:50.860
having upstream stuff you send upstream getting accepted and integrated into the wider ecosystem.

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:51.860
Right.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:52.860
And it raises the question too, right?

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:57.180
It's upstream's job to guard against modifications or changes that are only, you know, make sense

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.140
for your base but may not make sense for the broader community.

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:01.140
Right.

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:12.580
So say Tuxedo decides to, in a year from now, let's say that after 1804 ships, Tuxedo,

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:15.620
they're going to – let's just – I'm just theory here.

01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:22.980
Tuxedo launches Unity 7 Legacy Edition because their customers have heard – they've heard

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:24.180
from their customers.

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:25.520
They got support tickets.

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:26.920
They got phone calls.

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:32.580
They got emails and they have tweets that all of these customers miss Unity 7.

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:39.700
So Tuxedo launches the Unity 7 Tuxedo Linux and it's great, Wes, because you log right

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:43.300
in and you just get the great traditional Unity 7 desktop.

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.300
My favorite.

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:45.300
It just knocks it out of the park.

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:47.180
It's really nice and standard and it's easy.

01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:51.180
And so they, you know, but a couple of users have noticed that the online accounts don't

01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:54.960
really support any of the modern services anymore because it's been a couple of years

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.100
and, you know, it'd be nice to sort of maybe get those updated.

01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:02.260
So Tuxedo writes a patch to add support to the online accounts to make sure that you

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:06.340
can log into you name it service, Mastodon, so you can get your fucking Mastodon account

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:10.460
logged into Unity 7 and they submit that upstream and then guess what?

01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:13.300
The canonical team looks at that and goes, yeah, well, that's great.

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:17.180
That's code for a desktop we don't maintain anymore for a social platform that's dominated

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.560
by social justice warriors that we don't support anymore.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.560
So thanks, but no thanks.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.520
We're not going to integrate that upstream, but thank you for writing the code.

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:27.340
And then Tuxedo writes a blog post about how they've written upstream code and they

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.580
submitted it, but nobody accepted it.

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:31.660
You see, there's no winning here.

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:34.380
No, there's not.

01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:35.820
I suppose there's not.

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:38.780
That's the world of distributions.

01:08:38.780 --> 01:08:43.060
I guess that's what's been frustrating here and what I was trying to get at earlier is

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:53.100
I just don't see the kind of tenants or axioms or clear thoughts behind what does it mean

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.100
for this to be a distribution?

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:55.900
What does it mean for it to be an OS?

01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:56.900
Why are we doing this?

01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:58.180
What are our changes actually be?

01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:02.420
Because when it was just like modifications that include drivers or new firmware or some

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:05.060
customizations that are the boot screen or whatever, okay, those all make sense.

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:10.440
Those seem like a reasonable level of customization to be applied to a base operating system.

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:14.760
But when I compared things, like when we've talked so much about Solace recently, et cetera,

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:19.260
that feels much more like something that has goals, it has process, it has a philosophy

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:21.180
behind it.

01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:25.980
I don't see these in that same light and it doesn't feel like an organic space for a Linux

01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:27.780
distribution to really thrive.

01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:34.660
I think the other thing that I find slightly irritating is seeing a company who's in a

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:40.520
difficult position like System76 or Tuxedo who clearly have customer demand or their

01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:47.460
own internal brainstorming that's decided they need to do this and then tell us that

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:51.740
they've waited for us to do something for three years.

01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:56.220
They could have contributed to Unity over those last three years.

01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:00.260
It's the same argument that I keep seeing when a project gets shut down, a lot of people

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:02.940
pop up out of the woodwork and then fork it.

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:07.620
It's like, well, the reason this died is because for the last three years you didn't contribute

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:12.340
but suddenly you want to contribute after the death of the thing has already been announced.

01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:15.620
If you wanted the thing to be better three years ago, you should have contributed three

01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:17.500
years ago, not now.

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:18.500
Okay.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:23.980
I want to play devil's advocate because I watched Ryan's interview on the Lunduke Hour

01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:30.840
and at the end of it, I felt like he didn't mention anything new.

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:34.220
There was nothing that hasn't been in a blog post or replies to comments that we didn't

01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:35.220
already know.

01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:36.220
I was a little disappointed.

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:40.580
I was hoping to hear something new because what he did toss out there was something about

01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:45.220
flat packs and snaps that didn't make any sense to me.

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:49.300
I actually did kind of understand a bit where they're coming from because he said something

01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:50.460
that really resonated with me.

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:53.540
He said, we just want to make great things.

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:58.020
We just want to do great work and fuck if I don't understand that, man.

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:01.220
I really understood – like when he said that, I was like, yeah, okay.

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:06.100
I can see where they're coming from to some degree and I can almost actually understand

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:08.980
why they had no other choice.

01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:15.020
I feel like they legitimately had no other choice than to do this and so I'm sitting

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:20.100
here like really super skeptical and at the same time, like I'm going like, yeah, I

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:22.980
kind of understand guys, why you had to do this.

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:24.540
So I kind of want to share some of that with you.

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:27.900
So let's talk first about Linux Academy, our last sponsor this week and we got to give

01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:29.300
this in before I forget.

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:34.620
There's a lot of barbecue stuff going on and the summer is here and Linux Academy is

01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:35.980
a great use of your time.

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:38.220
You're sitting around wasting time right now.

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:39.220
Use Linux Academy.

01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:42.620
If you're sitting around in your car driving to work right now and you're thinking, man,

01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:47.180
I wish I had a lifestyle that enabled me to live a little bit differently, Linux Academy,

01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:49.500
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:54.380
I say this because before they ever became a sponsor, I had a lot of conversations.

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:57.140
In fact, I had conversations about producing content for them.

01:11:57.140 --> 01:12:03.220
I had conversations about running shows on the JB network from them.

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:08.420
We really kind of came eye to eye on one thing and that was spreading the adoption of Linux.

01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:12.020
Now this was several years ago now, which almost sounds like a stupid thing to say because

01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:13.540
it's like so crazy.

01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:16.180
How do you say it?

01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:17.180
I'm not sure.

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:18.180
I can't say it post-Berman.

01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:19.180
You are not that.

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:20.540
That's not your name.

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:23.940
Please, just talk about Linux Academy.

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.080
Oh, okay.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.080
Linux Academy.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.080
Please, I need to know.

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.080
Linux Academy.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.080
Okay.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.080
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:34.480
And when we were first talking and then later on a couple months later we were talking about

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:39.540
how they were building out their virtualization system so that you could do these labs where

01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:45.680
Where you SSH into a server and you're working on a real server.

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:49.020
It's such a difference because that's exactly how I learn.

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:52.220
It means when I go to – not only does it mean I'm going to test better, which is

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:56.160
obviously a benefit, but I think the thing that matters a lot more than that is when

01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:01.000
I actually go to do the work, I have the confidence that I've done this before because I actually

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.980
did it in one of their hands-on labs and they have instructor mentoring too, like real human

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:05.980
beings to help you.

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:10.420
They have CERTs – if you want to go for CERTs, they have courses for that, like just

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:11.420
HyperCard.

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:13.220
Are you familiar with that?

01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:14.540
They don't have courses on that.

01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:15.540
No.

01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:21.300
They also don't have courses on barbecue because they're focused.

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:27.260
They don't have courses on Windows Command Line Essentials or working with the IPX protocol.

01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:28.740
They don't have courses on that.

01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:31.920
But they do have flashcards that are forked by the community and made better and better

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:32.980
to help you study.

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:36.020
They have nuggets when you have just a little bit of time you want to do a deep dive.

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:38.900
They have a course scheduler when you've got a time frame and you need to just stick

01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:44.840
to it, kind of like an exercise for your mind – linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.100
So I was looking at both Pop!

01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:47.100
OS.

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:53.300
I kind of ironically – I have it installed on a Dell Precision laptop.

01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.300
I have Pop!

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.300
OS right now out there.

01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:56.300
Yes, you do.

01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:59.300
I've invited everybody here to the barbecue, which is – how many people do you think

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.300
we have here?

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.300
I couldn't even –

01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:02.620
That's a great question.

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:03.620
Yeah.

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:04.620
We have a lot of people here.

01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:05.620
We have a good amount.

01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:06.620
They're the best people.

01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:10.300
And more than a dozen, not including us.

01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:13.700
And I've asked them all to kind of take a look at it, like, hey, here is the Dell Precision

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:14.700
running Pop!

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:15.700
OS.

01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:16.700
And I always snicker.

01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:21.620
And one of the things I was really impressed with – and I'm showing the Tuxedo Zubuntu

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:22.620
screencast right here.

01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:26.180
That's the – let me just mute that because that music is distracting me.

01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:29.300
I think I would like XFCE more if it came with that music.

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:30.300
Yeah, right?

01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:36.820
And looking at both Pop! OS and Tuxedo Zubuntu, I get it.

01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:37.820
I do get it.

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:42.500
They – and I'll talk more about System76 because I get it more than Tuxedo.

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:47.660
Tuxedo is a joke because it looks like a house of cards.

01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:53.060
In fact, if I'm not mistaken, their previous attempts have been pretty, pretty bad.

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:59.020
I'm sure you must have had some experience from their Ubuntu Mate attempt in the past.

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:04.380
So the review unit that I received had an Ubuntu Mate image on it, but they made a number

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:09.040
of customizations beyond the kernel stuff I referenced earlier.

01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:15.040
So they'd replaced the Greeter – they replaced the GTK Greeter with the Unity Greeter, which

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:20.580
as a distro maintainer, as soon as I saw that when the thing booted up, I knew it was going

01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:25.740
to be bad because I know full well that that breaks things in Mate because it pulls in

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:32.620
different input managers, so IBUS for example, and it means that the keyboard layout is completely

01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:34.900
un-configurable.

01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:40.660
So that was one example, but also because of that change and the way that Ubuntu Mate

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:44.440
16.04 is put together, they have this – this is something that they've created.

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:46.940
They have a script that runs on first login.

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:51.180
Now it's in German language, so I didn't know what it said, but I had it translated

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.180
since.

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:58.300
So it basically says welcome, and you click okay, but behind the scenes that does an apt-get

01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:04.980
auto – apt-get minus y auto remove, and that actually removed most of the Ubuntu Mate

01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:06.780
meta packages and software.

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:07.780
No.

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:08.780
No.

01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:11.380
Yeah, so that was the out-of-box experience.

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:17.240
Now these are considerations, so you know when – you can hear the full gruesome story

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.240
on Ubuntu podcast.

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:20.500
There's a full review of the laptop.

01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:23.220
Yeah, it was good too.

01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:25.900
You were actually pretty polite, if I'm going to say.

01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:27.380
You were actually fairly polite.

01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:28.380
Yeah.

01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:33.420
I mean it's disappointing from my point of view because I obviously make Ubuntu Mate

01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:37.840
and I've put a lot of effort into it over the years for it to work hopefully the right

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.960
way when people install it for the first time, so to think that people might be buying computers

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:48.460
and this is what they expect, that reflects badly on my work, and it also reflects badly

01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:50.000
on Tuxedo.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:59.060
But it's an illustration of the kind of naivety that someone who isn't a distro maintainer

01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:01.980
has about how easy it is to maintain a distro.

01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:07.940
You know, all I'm doing is changing the greeter and changing the theme with not a full appreciation

01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:11.060
of what the knock-on effects of doing that might be.

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:17.220
A cynical person, Martin, might think that the negative feedback that you gave to the

01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:25.820
people at Tux, whatever they call Tuxedo, that negative feedback might reflect badly

01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:32.020
on the recent blog post where they talk about how their XFCE edition is better memory footprint

01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:33.020
even Ubuntu Mate.

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.020
Yeah.

01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:35.020
I don't care what they write.

01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:40.740
They also took a couple of shots at System76 in that post, it's in German so it's a little

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:43.140
hard to translate, but yeah they did.

01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:46.220
Yeah, you know, that's fine.

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:51.940
I mean they're welcome to make the comparisons that they want to make, that's fine by me.

01:17:51.940 --> 01:18:02.100
So here's where I could kind of see no other choice than doing this and I have to make

01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:05.900
some assumptions and I'm not saying these assumptions are correct, but I'm going to

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:10.460
make some assumptions to just try to share what I perceive to be their side based on

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:17.540
what I've read, talking in years of conversations with Carl and recently with Ryan.

01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:21.020
I know every person in the System76 office except for the couple of new people they've

01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:26.160
hired since I've been there last, but I actually met one of them at Linux Fest, two of them.

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:27.160
So actually I think I know everybody there.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:28.700
And that third one, he's coming for you, watch out.

01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:33.380
So I'm not saying this is not officially their position and I'm not saying this is the position,

01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:37.260
I'm saying this is my insight, maybe it's an 11 year customer too.

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:43.540
I think that they have reached a point where they have maximized the leverage that they

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:49.260
can apply against the ODMs and the ODMs being Clevo perhaps and others.

01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:53.660
And so they are trying to be competitive, they want to create a workstation, mobile

01:18:53.660 --> 01:19:00.980
and desktops, that address creators, developers, engineers, specifically people who are most

01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:02.420
likely to buy Linux machines.

01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:06.660
People we've talked about on this very show and said, let's be real, new users aren't

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:08.140
coming to Linux automatically.

01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:09.620
You have to introduce them to Linux.

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:13.660
Otherwise the people that are seeking out Linux are Windows and Mac OS refugees that

01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:16.140
just want to get their damn job done.

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:19.740
And a lot of times they're writing software, they're in the engineering, scientific or

01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:22.860
creative field.

01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:28.540
And on top of that, System76 makes machines that are exceedingly more powerful than most

01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:31.140
other hardware manufacturers.

01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:35.660
Like we have Doug out there in the living room right now who has the Bonobo workstation

01:19:35.660 --> 01:19:41.100
and he pulls that thing out of his bag man and it is the size of a skyscraper.

01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:46.780
But sure enough, if it's not a powerhouse with ports for days and power for centuries.

01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:49.580
And the Oryx Pro is the same, right?

01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:52.540
It's nothing like Apple makes, it's nothing like HP makes.

01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:55.820
It's similar to stuff Dell makes but it's still in its own category and its own league

01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:58.140
with certain things plus it's Ubuntu.

01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:03.300
Now if you're making this hardware and you've got these customers that are coming to you

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:11.540
looking for something other than a laptop that has four USB-C ports, you want to be

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:17.020
able to provide an experience that's similar to the competition, a complete hardware and

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:18.020
software experience.

01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:19.020
And …

01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:20.540
Matthew Feeney Dare I say, synergy?

01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:23.580
Jason Kuznicki There gets to be a point when you start considering

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:30.100
things like super high resolution screens, LTE modems, dual batteries, other things we

01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.300
haven't even considered that you might just …

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:36.980
You're just going to have to start making more and more fricking modifications to Ubuntu

01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:41.460
that it's almost a joke to call it Ubuntu anymore because you've got a PPA in there

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:45.860
that makes kernel module stuff, it puts stuff all over the file system, it changes the way

01:20:45.860 --> 01:20:49.980
things operate and now you're maybe preloading software like a blender, maybe you're going

01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:52.860
to preload a text editor that people really like.

01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:57.380
You're going to make this thing more readily available and just out of the box great workstation

01:20:57.380 --> 01:20:58.380
for developers.

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:02.460
So you're going to maybe put something crazy on there like visual studio code or maybe

01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:05.860
for strategic reasons you want to just totally integrate flat packs throughout the entire

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:06.860
operating system.

01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:10.820
So there are these things that you're considering and then there are these back in the mind

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:12.660
problems you've had with support over the years.

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:17.180
Like a lot of times we've had to fix problems by just shipping people newer drivers that

01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:20.820
aren't in mainline Ubuntu so that's often the fix.

01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:24.940
So it'd be kind of better if we could just release maybe every three months, if we could

01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:29.200
just push out a release every three months with the latest drivers that fix microcode

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:34.260
issues that make hyper-threading unstable and fix problems with your Thunderbolt controller

01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:38.820
and enable the webcam or the fingerprint reader and we're just going to push this stuff every

01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:42.100
single month and including that we'd like to update the theme and make it look good

01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:44.860
and keep polishing the brand because we've got a person over here working on it all the

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:46.460
time and they're always making modifications.

01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:51.260
Jesus, you really can't call this Ubuntu anymore.

01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:53.700
And now all of a sudden you're at a position where what do you do?

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:57.700
Do you keep calling it Ubuntu because that starts pretty much getting you in, I would

01:21:57.700 --> 01:22:04.900
think, in the sights of trademark issues or did you say, you know what, fuck it.

01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:09.140
We can maintain this, we can do the Q&A before we ship these machines, if it's not ready

01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:13.380
we won't ship it, we're going to base it on Ubuntu anyways, we'll be able to take advantage

01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:16.940
of their repos and we won't have to host all that stuff so we'll save a ton of money and

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:20.860
we'll ship it on our machines and we'll put it out there and you know when people complain

01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:27.100
we'll say it's Ubuntu but it's our own spin and honestly how could you not do that, seriously,

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:29.560
how could you not do that?

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:30.560
How could you not do that?

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:31.980
I mean it's pretty tempting right now, yeah.

01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:32.980
I kind of want to do it myself.

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:35.420
I actually started an Ubuntu spin while you were talking.

01:22:35.420 --> 01:22:39.140
Yeah, I mean if I didn't have the scale to participate in the OEM program where I could

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:45.900
just make Canonical do the work for me, this is the route I would go.

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:50.340
And that's why you see Tuxedo doing it, Purism actually did it early on, we didn't realize

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:54.780
it, but these guys are really copying what Purism did months ago.

01:22:54.780 --> 01:23:02.260
Purism did this initially and I have talked to several sources inside Purism that have

01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:06.180
told me that one of the reasons that they shipped their own desktop instead of Ubuntu

01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:14.660
Vanilla and I've heard this from multiple sources that System76 was already shipping

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:19.660
Vanilla Ubuntu so they had to differentiate so that's why they didn't ship Vanilla Ubuntu

01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:21.540
with the Librems.

01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:23.060
Interesting.

01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:29.540
So it's almost like System76 is going to open themselves up to more market competition

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:33.780
because there is a market for people that really want real Ubuntu because this is what

01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:38.540
they need for their job and they want their machine, their laptop, their dev environment

01:23:38.540 --> 01:23:40.420
to mere production.

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:44.980
So as I understand it System76 have said that although they're going to debut Pop!

01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:49.980
OS for 17.10, they will continue to offer Ubuntu as an install option at the point of

01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:50.980
purchase.

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:52.620
Oh very good, I think that's smart.

01:23:52.620 --> 01:24:03.300
I don't think it's going away at all but it isn't clear to me what customer Pop OS is

01:24:03.300 --> 01:24:05.020
looking to serve.

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:09.180
I've not seen anything in the discussions to fully understand that.

01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:14.500
Well what if it is just somebody who wants a really great GNOME desktop on Ubuntu?

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:20.940
Like if Ubuntu is going to go all in on GNOME and Ubuntu is my jive, then why not run something

01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:25.740
that's like the Mint of Ubuntu for GNOME?

01:24:25.740 --> 01:24:29.340
I don't think you want to start labelling Pop OS as the Mint of Ubuntu.

01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:32.020
I think that would be an unfortunate.

01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:33.460
But you follow my drift though right?

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:36.940
There has been a market demand there.

01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:43.100
Yeah so I mean the thing about Linux Mint, and this is another concern I have about these

01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:50.300
OEMs going their own way as opposed to working with distros, is that there are all manner

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:52.160
of considerations that get made.

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:57.580
So you were talking earlier about the GNOME JavaScript backend, GJS.

01:24:57.580 --> 01:25:03.540
That was recently added to the main repository for Ubuntu 17.10 as part of the migration

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:06.220
to the GNOME desktop.

01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:11.780
But that came under quite a lot of security scrutiny by the security team at Canonical

01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:14.420
because that has a short maintenance window.

01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:20.020
So their questions were how do we maintain this thing that is fundamental to the desktop

01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:29.580
that has such a short lifespan and is able to pull down code from arbitrary online sources?

01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:33.200
So that was something that was thought about long and hard at Canonical.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:38.980
Now I'm not saying that System76 are about to do this or Tuxedo are about to do this,

01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:44.780
but somewhere along the line Linux Mint started making decisions about the governance and

01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:49.880
the direction of their projects and they ended up with a decision which is you will never

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:55.060
get critical security updates by default.

01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:59.860
It's those kinds of decisions that you can work with a wider group of people with security

01:25:59.860 --> 01:26:05.100
teams with people with experience of putting distros together to help overcome those tough

01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:08.660
decisions and present some insight that you may not have on your own.

01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:12.420
So it also strikes me as a position of comfort.

01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:18.220
So these are decisions that are being made both by Tuxedo and System76 that strike me

01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:23.580
as short term decisions that don't reflect what we have coming over the horizon.

01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:28.820
Linux has got a lot of really big things and because we're talking about System76 and

01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:32.200
Tuxedo I want to keep it focused on the desktop here for a second but there's so many things

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:34.420
I could go into that are server related.

01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:38.900
But just specifically on the desktop you've got Wayland coming down the pipe but it's

01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:43.900
not I mean it won't be that many more episodes until we're talking about GTK4 and wouldn't

01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:52.180
it if we were talking about the transition to Wayland and GTK4 right now imagine System76

01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:59.460
and Tuxedo now having to take and Mint and Mint who just got to GTK3 with like a dozen

01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:08.500
episodes ago now imagine witnessing them make the painful transition to GTK4.

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:13.860
It's a position of luxury in which there has been some refinement and stagnation for the

01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:18.500
last few years and it is with that mindset that it seems like well this shit's going

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:19.500
to be easy.

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:22.740
You know what I just do this I just do that and I just put it up here on this and I got

01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:26.020
the GitHub community and what's the problem?

01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:30.380
And it's not until you have to really start doing some significantly heavy lifting where

01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:33.700
these things are going to change and then all of a sudden we're right just like the

01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:38.140
point was made earlier we're right back in the Android system where Samsung's delaying

01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:42.780
their latest OS by six months because they got to make sure that the new Samsung UI works

01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:46.420
with the latest version of Android.

01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:52.780
Now as far as I know the transition to GTK4 isn't going to introduce the kind of theming

01:27:52.780 --> 01:28:00.180
complexities that the not so distant past with GTK3 did but like you say just adding

01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:05.260
a theme is easy but then maintaining that theme through new releases of the toolkit

01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:11.340
can be a massive undertaking and we've seen this in the Linux community.

01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:18.060
Just look at how many independent theme creators there were six years ago and now look at how

01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:23.820
many are actively making new themes today because they have drifted away because they

01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:29.420
got screwed over every six months every time they had to rework their themes and it just

01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:32.460
became too much effort for a lot of people.

01:28:32.460 --> 01:28:35.740
Yeah that is actually really true that is something I've watched personally some of

01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:40.180
my favorite themes have died off.

01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:45.300
Wow but at the same time I don't deviate from the from the position like I totally understand

01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:47.540
why they've done it and I almost don't think they had any other option.

01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:50.540
Even when you feel maybe that they're you know that a bunch of you is less focused on

01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:52.580
the desktop or on what they're doing.

01:28:52.580 --> 01:28:58.020
Well I if I could have if I could have like gotten a Doctor Who time machine or a Bill

01:28:58.020 --> 01:28:59.020
Sh- It's in the garage.

01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:00.020
Oh yeah?

01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:01.020
Uh-huh.

01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:02.020
Oh what about the Bill- I think Dylan's playing with it.

01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:04.860
What about the Bill Shatner Bird of Prey that I can fly around the sun can I because that's

01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:06.580
my preferred method of transportation.

01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:07.660
It's cloaked I'm sorry.

01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:12.340
If I could go back just six months and I could if I could have a if I can have a little closed

01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:16.700
room conversation with Carl I go into his office where he's got his he's got his system

01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:21.780
set up there and I would sit down and I'd say Carl I would say stay tuned three to five

01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:26.140
months after this Unity 7 announcement that's coming and he'd say what Unity 7 announcement?

01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:29.620
I'd say don't worry about it but there's gonna be something important it's gonna in fact

01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:33.700
it's gonna also impact Unity 8 and that phone you've been working on for three years and

01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:36.940
you're gonna be super upset about it but if I could just give you one piece of advice

01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:41.100
and I'm like I'm like biff right now I'm giving biff like the sportsbook you know I'm saying

01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:48.500
just give it six months and see where they go because I'll tell you I have subscribed

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:52.880
to the mailing list for the Ubuntu desktop because Will Cook is submitting stuff every

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:57.580
single week about what they are working on and sure enough if not every single week it

01:29:57.580 --> 01:30:02.460
has it hasn't made something useful for the Linux action news about what they're doing

01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:08.060
to make the transition to Unity from Unity I should say to Gnome easier and the things

01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:13.580
that they're tweaking to make it a they're adding features that I wish the Unity 7 desktop

01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:18.540
had then they're adding to the Gnome desktop so it just you know if you just hang tight

01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:23.380
for a few months and see where things go hang tight till the LTS you know hang tight ship

01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:27.740
it ship it and just wait till the LTS and see what happens and then by the LTS if you

01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:32.460
don't like what you're seeing rebase off of that 1804 would be the thing to base off

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:36.340
if you're gonna create a distribution at that point I'm sorry don't call it distribution

01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:40.620
if you're gonna create an operating system this is an OS man base it off the LTS and

01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:44.900
give yourself a buffer to figure this shit out to figure out transitions to Wayland to

01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:48.980
figure out transitions to GTK 4 to wonder if maybe you should have gone with the plasma

01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:54.380
desktop to really differentiate yourself give yourself that buffer with the LTS but to go

01:30:54.380 --> 01:31:00.820
with 1710 to go with 1710 they know better than that I mean I know they want to ship

01:31:00.820 --> 01:31:03.660
the latest hardwares and they want to ship the latest kernels and they want to ship the

01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:10.620
latest enablements but my god go with the 8 go with the 1804 you have watched Ubuntu

01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:18.240
for 11 years you know that they roll this shit out in the in between releases and they

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:22.620
bang things around to see how it works and then they nail it down for the LTS you know

01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:29.980
that you know that you know that you know that so why would you base your OS off of

01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:38.300
a 1710 which is mid transition mid effing transition mid transition it is the most awkward

01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:43.260
stage of what Ubuntu is going to be for the last 11 years that you have been shipping

01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:48.340
Ubuntu quite literally not even the transition to unity was this awkward because you nailed

01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:55.060
that you got it but this is it this is the most awkward moment in the last 11 years of

01:31:55.060 --> 01:32:00.820
the Ubuntu desktop it's 1710 and it looks good I mean I'm really impressed but you based

01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:06.160
it off 1710 I know right now I know right now it's 1704 I understand that I have it

01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:11.580
installed I'm running it but you're going for 1710 and that's crazy that's crazy why

01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:15.620
wouldn't you wait for the LTS why wouldn't you give them a few months to figure out what

01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:20.260
they're doing because you know what it looks pretty good they're working with upstream

01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:24.420
they're getting snap support built in to gnome software so it's not some weird canonical

01:32:24.420 --> 01:32:29.520
patch set to the gnome desktop they're making sensible choices with extensions they're asking

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:35.060
the community for their feedback it's it is a clear transition already in its early beta

01:32:35.060 --> 01:32:39.760
state it is a clear transition from the unity 7 desktop to the gnome desktop it's exactly

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:45.100
what I would think the system 76 customers would want would be stable simple transition

01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:53.140
to know and what's pop OS shipping no it should be no it should be known three pop OS is shipping

01:32:53.140 --> 01:33:00.860
known three what is Ubuntu 1710 shipping no no three it's the same thing so all of the

01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:05.740
heavy lifting of a transition all of the awkward stuff all of the stuff that's weird and different

01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:13.580
it's it's happening regardless and they're making it an easy transition pop OS is not

01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:17.940
bad I mean the theme is not bad I kind of like it you did the whole show notes and everything

01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:24.660
on it today right not bad not bad however it is nothing like unity and the thing is

01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:29.180
the gnome 3 implementation that Ubuntu 1710 is going to ship with is a lot like unity

01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:36.460
it looks like unity it's familiar it is an obvious transition path what pop OS is is

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:43.420
more like XP to Windows 8 I see what you're saying I mean it does kind of feel like unfortunate

01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:47.500
timing you know when they when they previously talked about like the pop theme etc that felt

01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:50.460
a little more natural like an immediate reaction something like okay well we don't know what's

01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:55.300
coming coming now I think I think you're entirely right that there is going to be a

01:33:55.300 --> 01:34:01.180
lot of changes and while system 76 does need to keep abreast of those what they have right

01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:06.420
now I think is stable enough they're not in a huge rush to present this whole new operating

01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:09.540
system that they suddenly have to support that they have it's like an entirely change

01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:17.700
of lifestyle and supports cycle and all of that I I guess I guess it really doesn't it

01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:24.460
doesn't matter as long as they offer the Ubuntu 1710 vanilla like if you have that as an option

01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:28.580
install and that's what makes your corporate purchaser happy then have at it and then if

01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:33.660
enthusiasts they like think it's a good idea can use pop OS and choose that it by by time

01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:37.380
or build time that's true that seems like that's actually a pretty good way to go about

01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:41.820
it and then system 76 will have the numbers they'll have that and they can see what's

01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:46.340
successful but myself if I was going to launch Jupiter broadcasting OS don't call it a distro

01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:51.340
if I was going to launch Jupiter broadcasting OS no way in hell would I base it on 1710

01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:59.500
I might go 1604 to be honest with you but I would probably wait for 1804 really so I

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:04.020
if so what I here's where I feel like I'm at is I would probably wait a couple of years

01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:07.780
to see how this thing plays out and I would probably buy it with Ubuntu for now and then

01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:12.700
I would just you know see where pop OS goes see if they get a good community you know

01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:15.460
and see if they start shipping some stuff I'm like damn that's a good idea and you

01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:18.260
know like you'll know because like some of their modifications will start showing

01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:22.580
up in the AUR right and you'll see Fedora users that are posting guides on how to get

01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:26.460
that and Ubuntu users will have guides on how to convert their existing Ubuntu install

01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:30.660
into more pop like if you start seeing that kind of stuff that'll be a sign that they

01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:34.060
have a they have some they have some good momentum they have some success here and I'm

01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:38.340
all for that like go for it and and then I'll just kind of sit back and wait and look at

01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:42.340
and go okay all right I'll wait for it and I'll wait till 1804 version ships and then

01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:46.220
that might be when I try it I mean I have a running now but I don't think I would run

01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:50.780
on anything in production until 1804 right I was gonna say that you know this in the

01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:55.540
same way it feels very much right it's like they're just like it's 1710 it's their 1710

01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:59.080
except even more so right it's like the the beta beta where they're they're kind of playing

01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:04.380
with this now it's just hard to have that kind of announcement and to have you know

01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:08.340
the interpretation is is always going to be like this is the future no matter what this

01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:14.260
is what you'll see when really there's a lot to come on both sides yeah to actually find

01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:17.300
out what we're gonna see long term you know what gets me fired up about it and like like

01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:20.860
a reason why I'm like so passionate still this is like the third show I've recorded

01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:27.700
about it I'm still like super fired up about it is it seems like they are they are just

01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:31.020
like they're just saying here Dell here's all the customers that just want a really

01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:35.540
good Ubuntu integrated machine you want an Ubuntu desktop that has firmware updates that

01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:40.980
come through gnome software and they just ship Ubuntu yeah and then you just want something

01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:45.240
that has Ubuntu proper with a couple of modifications to make high DPI look right or to make wireless

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:50.460
work and canonicals done that development work like it's like the most proper Ubuntu

01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:55.420
you could possibly get on your workstation that's now Dell yeah and if you would have

01:36:55.420 --> 01:37:03.020
asked me I would have a year ago I would have said it's system 76 but it's not full stop

01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:08.140
end of sentence that's a huge game changer right there that's a huge game changer right

01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:17.420
now and that is a massive conscious decision that system 76 is made and if the pop OS is

01:37:17.420 --> 01:37:22.280
successful then it was a wise choice and if they can really provide something valuable

01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:26.460
there it's going to pay off but if people are buying their hardware because they want

01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:33.780
a really good machine that runs Ubuntu they've really marginalized themselves a bit and that's

01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:38.320
why it gets me fired up because I've been a customer for 11 years and I am I'm so passionate

01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:41.300
about that and I'm so passionate about an idea about a hardware vendor that's pushing

01:37:41.300 --> 01:37:46.620
this forward and it's oh man it seems like the riskiest time of because also at the same

01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:51.980
time they're launching manufacturing that's everything right that's the whole thing who

01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:59.620
man I guess we'll see yeah yeah I think if unless he changes his mind now Ryan's going

01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:03.740
to be joining Joe soon on Linux action news oh is that yeah because I'm going to go to

01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:07.900
Montana with Noah soon and I think the beard is going to fill in for me here on this show

01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:12.040
how about that yeah is that good with you yeah he offered I'm like yeah man although

01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:14.540
you might have to sit here and you might have to sit there yeah because I don't want to

01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:17.660
mess with we'll be staring into each other so yeah yeah you'll be staring into his beard

01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:22.860
don't kid yourself yeah that's true yeah and look away and then we've asked Ryan to fill

01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:27.620
in for me on Linux action news for one episode you know and I don't think they're gonna talk

01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:31.500
a lot about it but it probably come up so that could be that could be in Linux action

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:35.940
news is like I think we just we're close to 10 episodes yeah you are if you haven't heard

01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:41.180
it yet it's like it is like a direct dose to your brain of Linux news and what I'm really

01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:45.460
proud of and I wouldn't have I wouldn't have it's funny because I wouldn't have thought

01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:48.540
of this ahead of time but there's a couple of things secret sauce wise that Joe and I

01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:52.460
are doing for the show that I think are really paying dividends right now and you if you

01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:56.900
listen to the episode half ketchup that's what it actually no it's not Mayo can you

01:38:56.900 --> 01:39:04.500
guess what else it is miracle web dude no there's just some secret sauce in there that

01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:08.980
we're doing that I think is is paying dividends and I think we do it I think we do an exceptionally

01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:15.860
good job of busting through the news and and taking hours and hours and hours of research

01:39:15.860 --> 01:39:20.500
and giving it to you in five minutes so it's like we do hours and like talking to people

01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:25.680
behind the projects emailing people to get follow-ups running the system running it on

01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:30.540
our systems and then we consolidate it down and and sometimes we even nail it under 30

01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:34.980
minutes and it's Linux action news calm and hell of hell of a show I'm really proud of

01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:38.900
the way it's coming together and so Ryan will be joining on that soon it's like those you

01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:42.780
know like the you know like NPR or other things it's like the five-minute news update it's

01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:47.100
like that acceptance instead of depressing world news it's like 30 minutes of awesome

01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:52.140
Linux right so it's better in every sense yeah eight episodes mr. bitten that verifies
