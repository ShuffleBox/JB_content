1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Look at this, we got 37 people in the virtual lug.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,080
Imagine all of us in an actual room together

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,600
doing a lug event.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,000
37, 40 people?

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,940
That's a little scary.

6
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,520
Don't worry, Wes has homemade hand sanitizer.

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,880
You can use it as a lotion.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,840
It's great stuff, we have just buckets of it.

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,600
All incented.

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,160
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 400.

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:52,920
Music

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,860
Hello friends and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

13
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,700
My name is Chris.

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,540
My name is Wes.

15
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:58,500
Hello, Wes.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,680
This special 400th episode of your Unplugged program

17
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,900
is brought to you by a Cloud Guru.

18
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,300
Learn by doing.

19
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,900
They are the leader in hands-on learning.

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,580
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

21
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,980
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs,

22
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,300
Cloud Linux servers, and much more.

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,540
Get your hands cloudy at acloudguru.com.

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,580
Welcome in, Mr. Payne.

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,420
Congratulations.

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,380
400, we're finally here.

27
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,140
It feels nice because not only do we have a lot planned

28
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,500
for this episode, a very special episode,

29
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,940
we have a fantastic showing in the virtual lug.

30
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,900
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

31
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,800
Hello, hello.

32
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,300
Hello.

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:33,800
Hello.

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,300
Hello.

35
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:34,800
Hello.

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,300
Hey.

37
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,800
Hey.

38
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,300
Howdy.

39
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,300
Ha ha.

40
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,580
Whoa.

41
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,380
Man, it is great to see a lot of you.

42
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,860
We have some old friends in there

43
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,660
that have spent a little time away,

44
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,900
but made time special, carved out of their busy schedules

45
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,360
to be here for the 400th episode.

46
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,220
And I don't know about you, Wes, but I

47
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,700
think I smell a little bacon.

48
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,540
What?

49
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,500
A little cheese bacon.

50
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,220
It can't be.

51
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,820
Hey, Cheesy.

52
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,420
Hello.

53
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:58,920
Hello.

54
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,420
Hello.

55
00:01:59,420 --> 00:01:59,940
Hey, guys.

56
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,580
How's it going?

57
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,900
Welcome back to the show, man.

58
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,700
It's been a little lonely without you.

59
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,180
Well, I miss you guys, too.

60
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,860
It's been a little bit of a hiatus, but yeah, I'm back now.

61
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,900
Well, you have some news to share with the class.

62
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,820
Some exciting news at that.

63
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:19,300
Yeah, so recently, I guess this will make the third week.

64
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,380
So far, I've recently moved over from ACG

65
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,380
to work with System76 directly as a content producer for them.

66
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,620
So I'll be doing product photography, videography,

67
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,060
of course, content.

68
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,540
Still working through exactly everything I'll be doing there,

69
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,740
but I'm really excited about it.

70
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,420
A great group of people, excited to be working with them.

71
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,460
Man, you know they're in Denver, not Texas, right?

72
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,260
Yes, which means I have to relocate,

73
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,940
which means I have to figure out how to consolidate 15 years

74
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,020
worth of crap and move what I want to Denver

75
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,980
and store what I can't move.

76
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,020
Well, congratulations.

77
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,660
Thanks, man.

78
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,940
I think she's just out Lennox jobbed you.

79
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,500
I know, right?

80
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,000
It's great.

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,580
I'm super.

82
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,780
System76 is such, if I were going

83
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,340
to work for a company again, it would probably like,

84
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,540
System76 would be one of the few on a list of three companies

85
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,140
that I'd consider.

86
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,260
They're just a great team over there.

87
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,180
So congratulations.

88
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,940
Also, it's been a little bit since Ironic Badger,

89
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,900
AKA my co-host from the self-hosted podcast, Alex,

90
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,460
has returned.

91
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,980
Alex, welcome back to the show, man.

92
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,580
Hello.

93
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,380
Congratulations to Cheese on his fantastic new job,

94
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,180
by the way.

95
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,020
Good job, mate.

96
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,740
Thanks, man.

97
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,540
Well, also, a congratulations is due for you as well.

98
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,660
You have some news to share.

99
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,780
Yeah, somebody should have stopped me, but I've had a kid.

100
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,540
Congratulations.

101
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,540
Oh, wonderful.

102
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,580
Alex is a daddy.

103
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,340
That's really cool.

104
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,780
He needed another project, and boy, do you have one.

105
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,500
You thought podcasting wasn't enough, huh?

106
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,780
Yeah, I'll tell you what, Wes.

107
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,860
Project velocity has definitely decreased since she arrived.

108
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,420
Well, it's just been reallocated to something well worth it.

109
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,220
Absolutely.

110
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,340
Yeah, it's a lot more long-term project.

111
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,140
Yeah, it's a whole thing.

112
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,940
So thank you.

113
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,540
Thank you for the little nod.

114
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,460
We have a huge turnout.

115
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,540
Of course, Brent's there too.

116
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,060
Hello, Brent.

117
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,260
Good to see you again.

118
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,260
Well, hello.

119
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,180
I have some little news too.

120
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,860
I'm moving near Denver as well.

121
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,460
What?

122
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,260
Congratulations.

123
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,820
I happen to get engaged, actually,

124
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,740
and my fiance is down there.

125
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,620
So I might become half-American.

126
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,340
Look out.

127
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:24,020
The JB family has grown a lot in the last year and change,

128
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,220
and it's interesting.

129
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,380
It seems like there's some convergence happening

130
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,420
on the Denver area because Drew, who couldn't be here today

131
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,580
because of the day job, will also eventually

132
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,700
be relocating to that area.

133
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,500
JB Central formation.

134
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,660
Yeah, and Wes and I don't mind us a road trip to Denver.

135
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,580
No.

136
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,660
No, we do not.

137
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,140
When are we going to relocate, Chris?

138
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,020
That's the question.

139
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,420
I mean, I'm pretty much good to go.

140
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,460
I think the kids are down too, so we just

141
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,900
got to pick up the jacks and hit the road.

142
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,980
But maybe we'll wait for the passes to clear a little bit.

143
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,500
I think where I'm going to be located

144
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,820
is roughly 45 minutes north of where Brent will be.

145
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,180
So I expect we'll be hanging out a lot more often.

146
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,380
Also, there's a really sweet flight from Payne Field

147
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,540
here in Washington to Denver that is ridiculously cheap when

148
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,820
you think about air travel.

149
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,460
I just like the idea of thinking and conceiving of travel again.

150
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,180
And that was a huge limitation for our 400th episode.

151
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,480
If we could have done anything, no doubt about it,

152
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,140
my preference would have been some big meetup

153
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,700
where we have this experience in person.

154
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,620
But we're not there yet.

155
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,380
That's just not an option.

156
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,100
But we wanted to celebrate our 400th episode somehow.

157
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,020
This show started as the Linux action show Unplugged,

158
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,260
launched in August 12, 2013.

159
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,460
And episode one was Too Much Choice,

160
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,740
classic topic about are there too many distros,

161
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,740
apparently the age-old question that's never been answered.

162
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,980
Fast forward to episode 100, July 7, 2015.

163
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,100
Mr. West Payne joins me after a barbecue, which was a meetup.

164
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,580
Yeah.

165
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,900
Yeah, so celebrating the show's 100 milestones with meetups

166
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,060
is kind of a tradition.

167
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,620
Who would have thought I would still be here

168
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,260
barbecuing at the studio?

169
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,100
We are barbecuing today.

170
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,700
We are absolutely barbecuing today.

171
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,620
We're making a whole day out of it.

172
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,180
But since we didn't have that option,

173
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,220
we still wanted to do something pretty different,

174
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,420
just really kind of have a different experience

175
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,460
altogether.

176
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,580
If you can imagine doing something for nearly eight

177
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,860
years that is entirely digital.

178
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,300
So we work our butts off every week,

179
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,700
and the end product is intangible.

180
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,180
It's like a 30 meg MP3.

181
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,080
Yeah.

182
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,940
And so it's years of collaborating together

183
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,100
on creating something that we've never really

184
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,440
had the tangible result for.

185
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,380
And we thought, wouldn't it be awesome for us

186
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,380
in our 400th episode to do kind of some sort of show prep that

187
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,500
was hands-on, that was physical, that resulted

188
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,580
in a physical object when we were done?

189
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:59,580
And we've always wanted to do a episode dedicated to the topic

190
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,220
since really the early days of the show of using

191
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,860
Linux to brew beer and make your beer even better.

192
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,580
Yeah, I mean, beer is often a component that

193
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,180
helps make this show better.

194
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,920
So the reverse situation just makes sense, right?

195
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,140
That's very true, right?

196
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,780
I mean, we'll find out.

197
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,340
And so we kind of stated this intention

198
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,500
about over a month ago or something on the air.

199
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,900
And several of you reached out, including

200
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,420
a listener named Corey.

201
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,940
And Corey seemed to really love an app called BeerSmith.

202
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,700
Hey, I'm Corey.

203
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,980
I love BeerSmith.

204
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,500
I've been using it for years.

205
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,420
And his email kind of made us feel

206
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,580
like maybe BeerSmith was the route we should take.

207
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,460
I mean, I even got so into it I contacted the developer of it

208
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,860
and started having a little chat with him.

209
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,620
And so we thought, well, if Corey's

210
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,220
been using this for like a decade,

211
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,380
let's call Corey up and talk to him

212
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,660
about how we could use BeerSmith on Linux

213
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,500
to plan our special beer.

214
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,300
It's a fantastic tool.

215
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,100
There's a lot of calculation that

216
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,380
goes into producing a beer recipe.

217
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:07,340
And there's a lot of online web pages and calculators

218
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,980
that you can use.

219
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,580
But BeerSmith does a very nice job of integrating all of that

220
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,020
and helping you plan your recipe to hit target alcohol volume,

221
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,620
to hit target bitterness, to even hit target

222
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,620
color of your beer.

223
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,660
And it has a number of calculators

224
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,620
that you can use as you're brewing the beer

225
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,980
and as you're carbonating it.

226
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,500
So it's incredibly useful.

227
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,380
Sounds like, too, that you could use it to recreate a good beer.

228
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,700
So if we really like this unplugged beer,

229
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,900
we could reproduce it.

230
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,700
Absolutely.

231
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,860
It has, you know, you can store your recipes.

232
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,180
You can, you know, save as and fork your recipes, if you will.

233
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,420
I have some recipes that I've been making iterations of

234
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,060
for years.

235
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,780
I do a barley wine, or at least have been after taking a hiatus,

236
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,660
barley wine every year.

237
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,900
And it seems to get stronger every year somehow.

238
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,140
But I started from a basic recipe

239
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,940
and just kind of modified it to make it work for me.

240
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,100
And you can just keep different versions or, you know,

241
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,140
however you want.

242
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,180
You suggested I contact Brad Smith, the author of BeerSmith.

243
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,380
So I emailed him and told him, hey, we're doing a Linux

244
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,700
podcast and we're brewing a beer for our show.

245
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,060
And he wrote back and he told me that he'd

246
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,340
started using Unix back in 85.

247
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,420
He worked alongside people that were working on Arpanet

248
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,420
back in the day, deploying SQL at the Air Force.

249
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,620
He mentioned that he used Minix, that he

250
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,220
has been developing the next version of BeerSmith

251
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,460
and the web version all on Linux.

252
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,340
And he uses BeerSmith on Linux himself.

253
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:40,820
Yeah.

254
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,860
Isn't that great?

255
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,860
No, it's really awesome.

256
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,700
And he used Minix.

257
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,420
That's, you know, wow.

258
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,420
So, you know, Brad Smith is this really cool guy

259
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,220
who's been doing this software for a long time.

260
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:55,340
And he has, he's really big in the home brewing community.

261
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,860
He has his podcast, which is, you know,

262
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,580
sponsored by his product, but he's not

263
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,740
pushing his product in it.

264
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,100
He's just talking about general brewing information.

265
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,740
Very active at conferences.

266
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,380
I've never met him or spoke with him,

267
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,980
but he seems like a really great guy.

268
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,660
And for your use case, also on Linux?

269
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,660
BeerSmith been working just fine on Linux?

270
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,300
It works great.

271
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,900
I started using it probably 2012.

272
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,300
I was on Linux Mint at the time.

273
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,660
I googled, what should my first distro be?

274
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,140
And about the same as it is now, Linux Mint came up.

275
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,860
And I used that for a while.

276
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,580
It worked great.

277
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,220
I think it was BeerSmith 2 I was on.

278
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,340
And now I'm using it on Ubuntu Mate.

279
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,060
And it works great.

280
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,220
The only thing that's not awesome is the dark mode.

281
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,460
It's a little jinky.

282
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,220
He doesn't have that fully implemented yet,

283
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,460
but I could just change the theme from dark to light

284
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,020
and boom, works great.

285
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,620
Well, I got BeerSmith installed and have been sort of poking

286
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,260
around.

287
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,620
And you are not kidding.

288
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,660
There is a lot in here, tons of tools, tons of options.

289
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,660
Do you have any tips for actually getting started?

290
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,380
Because we're kind of relearning how to brew beer

291
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,740
and then also maybe learning BeerSmith.

292
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,940
Sometimes it's almost like taking a dump truck

293
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,940
to go grocery shopping.

294
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,900
It has a lot on it.

295
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,180
So what I would recommend for anybody starting out

296
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,340
is start with a kit where they do all the planning for you

297
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,540
and you can kind of see what goes into it.

298
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,460
And you make the kit.

299
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,700
You kind of get your rhythm down, your process down.

300
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,420
And then you start looking at different recipes.

301
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,580
You can get them from books.

302
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,980
There's a ton of them online.

303
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,460
Homebrew Talk is a very good online forum

304
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,220
that's been around forever.

305
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,900
And there's tons of recipes.

306
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,580
And so you can start trying out some of those recipes.

307
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,780
And then you can branch off to make the recipes taste

308
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,140
the way you want.

309
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,100
And part of this, when you start making beers,

310
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,780
you tend to learn a lot about beer.

311
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,580
When I started out brewing beer, I

312
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,660
knew there was Bud Light, there was Guinness,

313
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,260
and there were things that were different than those.

314
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,660
And that was about all I knew.

315
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,820
And you start learning about different beer flavors,

316
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,940
how the malts interact, how the hops play into it,

317
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,540
other than some beers have no hops

318
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,460
and some beers have all the hops.

319
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,060
And you get a bit of foundation of that

320
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,660
when you're using other people's recipes

321
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,260
and when you're using kits.

322
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,460
And then you start kind of figuring out on your own

323
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,580
and making your own recipes.

324
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,220
The beer I have now, I'm calling it Fieldward.

325
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,020
It's a dodgy part of town outside of Waterdeep and D&D.

326
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,380
It's an oatmeal stout.

327
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,700
And I've formulated the recipe.

328
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,620
And I'm quite happy with.

329
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,780
I like that tip.

330
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,380
We basically could learn from others

331
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,740
by following others' recipes and getting these kits.

332
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,140
And it's sort of like training wheels for beer brewing,

333
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,860
because there's just so much to it.

334
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,500
Yeah.

335
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,220
Well, the thing with brewing is this

336
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,860
is one reason why a lot of engineering types

337
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,860
are drawn to it, because there's the creativity part where

338
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,020
you're designing the recipe.

339
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,420
But there's also a process.

340
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,220
And the process is very important,

341
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,300
because you can have an amazing recipe.

342
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,820
But if your process allows for contamination

343
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,220
or if it allows for oxygenation when you don't want it,

344
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,380
there's all these things that could happen

345
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,580
or a bad fermentation temperature that

346
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,100
could give you bad flavors.

347
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,340
So even with the best recipe with the best ingredients

348
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,420
with the highest quality water, if you

349
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,820
don't have your process down, you

350
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,500
could end up with a beer that tastes weird.

351
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,620
So it's great to use some kits or other people's recipes

352
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,400
to start out with and just kind of figure out your process

353
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,060
and how to make that work for you.

354
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,260
Well, Corey, thank you.

355
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,540
Thank you guys very much.

356
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,580
The other great thing about Beersmith, of course,

357
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,460
is that it's a desktop Linux application that

358
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,220
makes a profit.

359
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,420
And it's nice to see some of those as well.

360
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,740
Mr. Bacon, you had a chance to play around with Beersmith,

361
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,100
I know, in your beer past.

362
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,060
Yeah, so previously, I would say maybe this

363
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,460
was four and a half, five years ago.

364
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,460
Another friend of mine, Chris, him and I would brew together.

365
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,260
And he turned me on to Bruce Smith.

366
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,220
And actually, one of the ways we met

367
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,740
is because we were talking about Linux and then brewing,

368
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,620
and then Bruce Smith kind of came up.

369
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,180
One thing that I really love about it

370
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,700
is that you can plan out your brew day easily.

371
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,740
So you basically can have a log of everything

372
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,380
that you need to do, all of the gravity measurements

373
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,300
that you need to take, where they need to be,

374
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,620
what to do to offset that.

375
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,380
But I absolutely agree with the guest

376
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,700
in that you should start with a kit

377
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,780
or start with some recipes that are already available out

378
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,420
there.

379
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:22,100
There's a great one, it's a left-hand brewing milk stout

380
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,860
clone that's really easy to make.

381
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,500
I would also recommend maybe making an ale,

382
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,340
and maybe not a lager, because generally, you

383
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,660
have to ferment those a little bit cooler.

384
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,820
And so you have to watch out with your fermentation there.

385
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,660
That's what I took away from our conversation,

386
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,420
is we needed a little bit of guidance.

387
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,980
Because Wes and I had both done this at different points,

388
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,980
but we were part of a team, and some others

389
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,700
had done some key components.

390
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,140
So we knew we needed some guidance.

391
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,300
I'd never done it entirely all myself.

392
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,940
And then I opened up Beersmith, which is impressive.

393
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,020
But I mean, there's just so many options,

394
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,060
so many different recipes.

395
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,420
It was like, OK, I need a few fewer variables.

396
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,140
Yeah, and we were thinking about building

397
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,660
a pretty sophisticated brewing setup

398
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,220
with a few different components that would be running Linux,

399
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,540
which we will get to in a bit.

400
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,060
But you were right.

401
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,300
You're right, Jesus.

402
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,020
And it was a point that Cory made, too.

403
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,100
We had to start somewhere that was defined,

404
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,300
because otherwise, it just felt like just so many options.

405
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,740
And we wanted to walk away with a beer that

406
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,220
was better than what you could get in the store on average.

407
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,980
Because I think that's something that you can really

408
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,300
appreciate, is that home brewing can often taste a lot better

409
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,060
than what you buy.

410
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,480
Well, even if it doesn't, it still

411
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,060
tastes better because you made it.

412
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,620
You made it.

413
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,460
It's fresh.

414
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,540
It tastes like pride.

415
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,060
What's really cool about Beersmith

416
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,300
is you can take it all the way to the level you want.

417
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,900
So you can start with a kit where you basically just

418
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,180
have extract, which is all your grains that have been boiled

419
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,260
down into this syrup that you do not want to get on anything

420
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,700
because it is super sticky.

421
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,020
And then you add that to water.

422
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,540
You bring it to a boil.

423
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,020
But then you have all grain brewing,

424
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:58,020
which is basically where you have all of the grains.

425
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,700
And you boil the grains together to make that same extract

426
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,340
or that same base for your beer.

427
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,420
That delicious, delicious base.

428
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,820
So we put our heads together, thanks to some help from Corey

429
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,260
and a lot of good email that came in.

430
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,580
And some chats that we had with people in Mumble.

431
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,620
We kind of just brought all this information together.

432
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,120
We were leeching off anyone who could give us tips, basically.

433
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,060
I think we came to a game plan.

434
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,220
Because if you think about it, we had only a few weeks

435
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:24,860
to pull this off.

436
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,620
We needed minimum time to beer here,

437
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:33,060
both for episode planning reasons and for our own tastes.

438
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,860
Linode.com slash Unplugged.

439
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,900
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards your new account

440
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,460
and, of course, support the show.

441
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,300
I think one of the things I really appreciate

442
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,460
about Linode and I appreciate about our audience

443
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,820
when we get to some milestone like 400 is everybody gets it.

444
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,260
You guys understand that this is a small business,

445
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,920
that we're working hard to pick good sponsors that we think

446
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,380
are going to be really a hit for you.

447
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,940
And you keep those sponsors happy by visiting our promo

448
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,660
URLs, like linode.com slash Unplugged,

449
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,740
because it's a signal that our audience responds

450
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,820
and that we're a worthwhile investment for Linode.

451
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,140
And that cycle has just sort of continued.

452
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,980
As we're now, you think about Jupyter Broadcasting,

453
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,660
we're nearing like 13 years or something like that.

454
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,180
I think that's like 50 years on the internet, right?

455
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,620
I'm pretty sure it works like that.

456
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,060
Yeah, I mean, remember when you started

457
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,580
and there was Ogg files around?

458
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,900
And that's why I'm not sitting here giving

459
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,100
you a read about underwear.

460
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,060
I'm telling you about Linode, which is our cloud hosting

461
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:26,580
provider.

462
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,180
They're an independent cloud provider.

463
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,980
And that matters more than ever these days.

464
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,860
They started in 2003.

465
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,800
And they have refined what they do down to excellence.

466
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,740
And they make it easy to give your creations

467
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,500
their own personal space on the internet,

468
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,420
no matter what skill level you're at.

469
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,780
If you're an old server salt or if you're brand new to it,

470
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,860
they have a dashboard that's super easy to use

471
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,900
and a technology stack that works with what

472
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,060
you're comfortable with.

473
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,200
Linode will help your ideas come to life on the web.

474
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,340
If it's a personal website or the entire back-end

475
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,780
infrastructure for your point of sale application.

476
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,800
And they have hundreds of guides and tutorials,

477
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,820
one-click application deployments that

478
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,860
make all this stuff really easy to get up and go.

479
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,580
Just go.

480
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,500
Just go.

481
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,260
Westpac is spinning up machines all the time

482
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,300
for testing here on the show.

483
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,060
Yeah, I just like to make you nervous.

484
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,820
I get these email notifications.

485
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,020
I love the email stuff they have set up, too.

486
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,140
One of the ways I can tell that the PeerTube

487
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,200
has gotten a lot of traffic, because I

488
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,360
have some thresholds set up.

489
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,740
So when it reaches a certain amount of transfer,

490
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,740
I get an email.

491
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,780
And it's like, oh, we hit our milestone.

492
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,420
And that's nice for the lazy admin,

493
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,940
when you can mostly ignore it.

494
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,700
But if something's happening, you know.

495
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,460
And then maybe you can go troubleshoot.

496
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,320
It's a great first sign that something could be up, too.

497
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,600
They also have S3-compatible object storage,

498
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,940
cloud firewalls, super fast networking, 11 data centers

499
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,260
worldwide, and much, much more.

500
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,260
So go get started.

501
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,100
And support the show.

502
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,460
And get a $100 60-day credit, $100.

503
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,340
I mean, you could really try all this stuff out,

504
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,180
the different range of machines, all of it.

505
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,100
You go to linode.com slash unplugged.

506
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,500
That's the URL to go to to get that $100 60-day credit

507
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,380
and to support the show.

508
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,900
linode.com slash unplugged.

509
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,400
I don't know if anyone else has heard

510
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,180
of this application or framework called Cloudron.

511
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,820
But just digging around Linode's one clicks,

512
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,300
I came across Cloudron.

513
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,980
Cloud-o-ron, like?

514
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,860
C-L-O-D-R-O-N, Cloudron.

515
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,660
OK, Cloudron.

516
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,860
It'll allow you to stand up basically one-click installs

517
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,460
for all your favorite things, so WordPress, Rocket Chat,

518
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,620
Next Cloud, GitHub, OpenVPN, basically

519
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,620
anything you could want.

520
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,140
And it's basically containers, right?

521
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,020
They're wrapping these containers in there.

522
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,340
But you manage it all from this one central hub.

523
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,180
Really cool, something I probably

524
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,860
would have never found had I not just been digging around

525
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,260
on Linode's one clicks.

526
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:39,700
Sweet.

527
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,060
We'll put a link to that in the show notes, Cloudron.io.

528
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,720
So with our brew planned, we were ready to start.

529
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,420
But we realized we probably needed some help.

530
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,300
And we realized we were going to have

531
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,460
to move quick to get this ready for 400,

532
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,980
because what's the point of doing

533
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,500
this if we don't have the physical thing

534
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,060
by the 400th episode?

535
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,860
That was the thing we wanted.

536
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,700
And we thought about it for a little bit.

537
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,400
You know what would be kind of a cheat code

538
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,280
is if we could learn off some experts.

539
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,940
And so our first idea was to go to a local brewery

540
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,820
and just sort of spend some time there.

541
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,900
Then I realized that with COVID and all of that,

542
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,740
they probably weren't going to be

543
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,760
cool about a couple of jerks doing a podcast,

544
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,100
calling up and asking to hang out in their brewery all day.

545
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,540
It was dicey to start with.

546
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,380
And now we have an extra hard sell.

547
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,080
Yeah, exactly.

548
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,300
So we found a local brew-your-own beer shop.

549
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,740
And that was, turns out, an ace's move,

550
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,900
because they had smart people who could help us

551
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,540
when we needed it, but were otherwise very hands-off.

552
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,360
And of course, they had top-of-the-line gear,

553
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,780
which would have been quite the initial investment for us.

554
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,140
So Wes and I are out here outside of Gallagher's

555
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,340
Where You Brew in Edmonds, Washington.

556
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,380
Are you ready to learn how to make beer, Wes?

557
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,220
Oh, yeah.

558
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,100
We figured we'd learn from the pros directly.

559
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,380
And also drink beer while we make beer,

560
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,780
because they serve beer, too, let's be honest.

561
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,700
This sounds like a recipe for success.

562
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,660
And the nice thing was is they were totally chill.

563
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,180
They let us get in, kind of get acquainted with the space.

564
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,020
And they also were really great about just giving us

565
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,620
a crash course on some beer basics.

566
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,020
But the yeast, the yeast will get up all the sugar,

567
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,180
turn it on to CO2 and alcohol.

568
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,100
After about a week, there'll be no sugar,

569
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,260
so the yeast will fall out of suspension, right?

570
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,620
After that happens, we'll take it back here to the cold room.

571
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,840
This is a beer nursery.

572
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,740
Go ahead.

573
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,500
The athlete and cold room.

574
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,620
Yeah, really.

575
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,740
They had this perfect setup that we were gonna be

576
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,840
totally taking advantage of.

577
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,620
So we were pretty set, but we knew since we were drinking

578
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,340
beer as we went, we'd probably need some brain backup,

579
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,740
not to mention a designated driver.

580
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,900
Sloppy idiots that we are.

581
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,940
I think it's best that Adia do all the precise measuring out.

582
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,540
What do you think, Chris?

583
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,100
Definitely.

584
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,100
Gotta bring the wife in.

585
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,340
Well, it did take precision, but at least it was fun.

586
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,420
Yeah, she's always bringing in the puns, too.

587
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,500
She insisted.

588
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,300
Then we get to work, and we have a recipe

589
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,500
that we've planned out.

590
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,780
We've kind of run it past these guys.

591
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,980
It's essentially a Belgium triple,

592
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,060
but we wanted to make some modifications.

593
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,980
And like all professional brewers,

594
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,620
we made those modifications at the absolute last minute.

595
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,460
In what may prove to be our undoing,

596
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,820
we've made a last minute recipe adjustment.

597
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,340
After all of our planning, all of our considering,

598
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,460
literally here at the last minute, we decided, well,

599
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,300
let's change it up.

600
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,020
So what do we do?

601
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,060
It's a last minute malt swap.

602
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,860
Turns out we had a lot of lager going into this already.

603
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,580
Nine liters.

604
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,320
We decided eight was probably enough.

605
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,580
And instead, we're sticking with originally,

606
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,780
we were called for one liter of wheat.

607
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,060
That's up to two.

608
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,940
That's right.

609
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,380
Two fancy liters.

610
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,660
After all that special planning, it was just sort of a whim.

611
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,620
And I think it paid off.

612
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,780
I think so.

613
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,460
But the moment really came to West.

614
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,060
Like, if I were to think back of that day,

615
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,540
there was one moment where you saved the day.

616
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,180
Touch and go Westpain just saved this thing from boiling over.

617
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:19,620
He jumped up like an agile lion out of his seat

618
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,500
and pulled the, what do you call this, massive wizard staff

619
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,700
that he's stirring with.

620
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,820
It's the beer wand.

621
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,100
He saved it with the beer wand.

622
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,580
So now it's time to add the bittering agents.

623
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,340
I mean, you got the boil just right.

624
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,500
You added the bittering agents just right.

625
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,860
I was getting a little too beer happy by that point.

626
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,180
Well, it's hard when they sell delicious beer at the spot

627
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,300
that you're making beer.

628
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,260
But I mean, they had such incredible equipment

629
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,780
and like steam power in this.

630
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,620
So it really got up to a boil pretty quick.

631
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,980
And it did almost boil over.

632
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,180
So really, once I think you had the confidence

633
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,380
of saving the brew, like the gazelle that you are,

634
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,240
I kind of felt like it empowered you.

635
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,380
And you sort of went into full artisan mode.

636
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,380
We've officially entered late stage brewing.

637
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,700
And the craftsman in Westpain is really emerging.

638
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,500
Tell us about the special care you're taking.

639
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,140
Well, it's really important that we infuse

640
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,140
as much cracked coriander and orange peel in here

641
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,660
as we can.

642
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,860
That's what makes it so tasty.

643
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,860
I mean, you really, you know, you took charge.

644
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,660
You really made it special.

645
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,900
And so I think you earned the final honor of releasing it

646
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,580
and storing it.

647
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,820
Our time has arrived.

648
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,700
It is time to transfer it to the primary fermenter.

649
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,780
Westpain will be in charge of the transfer valve.

650
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,700
It is a responsibility like no other.

651
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,660
Hey, good sir.

652
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,140
Go ahead with that warp.

653
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,620
Perfect.

654
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,580
Warp's coming your way.

655
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,140
Wes has flipped the warp valve.

656
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,780
And now our beer is going down a series of tubes

657
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,420
and into what can only be described

658
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:50,620
as a vessel, a sacred vessel, that will hold our beer.

659
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,940
Here it goes, Wes.

660
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,740
Here goes our beer.

661
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,940
Cool.

662
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,700
Look at it flow.

663
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,020
That is pretty great.

664
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,520
All right.

665
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,180
Want to go down the hole?

666
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,380
You can watch it drain right out of the kettle.

667
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,020
From the kettle into the storage.

668
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:06,220
And then we come back in two weeks and we bottle.

669
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,300
It felt kind of like somewhat anticlimactic to walk away

670
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,420
because then you don't know what's going to happen.

671
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,860
Like, did we mess something up?

672
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,380
That last minute tweaking?

673
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,540
Did we drink too many beers?

674
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,780
Only time would tell.

675
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,180
We had to wait.

676
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,860
Yeah, and so it was indeed a bit of a wait.

677
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,260
But we will get back to that.

678
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,060
We had lessons to learn in the meantime.

679
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,420
But before I get to those, I want

680
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,780
to say hello to Drew, who's making a last minute

681
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,280
appearance.

682
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,780
Hey, Drew.

683
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,580
Hey, guys.

684
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,340
I leave for, what, like six months

685
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,100
and you're out here brewing beer?

686
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,100
Good Lord.

687
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
Hello, hello, sir.

688
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,740
How are you?

689
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,140
It's good to hear from you.

690
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,900
Doing well, doing well.

691
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,540
I didn't want to miss episode 400.

692
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,380
Well, we appreciate you being here.

693
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,960
I was just telling everybody earlier

694
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,660
that we felt like for 400 we wanted something tangible.

695
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:54,100
You work on something for like almost eight years

696
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,200
and it's always a virtual product.

697
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,300
It was nice to do something that we could sit here

698
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,860
and actually hold in our hands.

699
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,140
So empowering.

700
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,340
I think you know what I mean.

701
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,020
I sure do.

702
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,640
I sure do.

703
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,260
And I hope you save me a bottle for the next time

704
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,180
I'm out there.

705
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,900
Oh, you know it.

706
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,720
You know it.

707
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,260
Yeah, that's absolutely happening.

708
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,060
Yeah, so don't you worry about that.

709
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,100
In fact, I have more on that in a little bit.

710
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,900
But we figured we'd spend the time while we waited

711
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,000
for our beer, anticipating what would happen next,

712
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,860
learning how to take this to the next level.

713
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,540
Because I think even before we were done,

714
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,380
you and I agreed we were enjoying this.

715
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,740
Yeah, we were having a good time.

716
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,500
And sure, yeah, we pressed the easy button to start out with.

717
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,740
But we liked learning about this.

718
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,500
There was more to learn and we were interested.

719
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,980
And the entire time when we were using their equipment,

720
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,300
we were like, OK, if we were doing this at the studio

721
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,600
or something, how would we do this?

722
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,460
And we would look up gear on YouTube or online

723
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,700
and look at equivalents that we could use.

724
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,660
And the guys at Gallagher's were really cool about saying,

725
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,760
OK, if you're doing this at home, you would do it this way.

726
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,940
And so that was really handy to help us picture

727
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,820
what it might be like if we wanted to keep doing this

728
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,620
and maybe brew some beer on a more regular cadence.

729
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,320
So we put our heads together and thought,

730
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,820
if we're going to do this long term,

731
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,500
we need some tips from a pro.

732
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,640
And so we caught up with Late Night Linux's Graham Morrison,

733
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,940
who has a full Linux-powered, full-timers brewing setup.

734
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,900
So Graham, before we go too far, could you describe to us

735
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,660
your current brew setup?

736
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:23,440
So my current brew setup is that I use a closed fermentation

737
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,220
system to basically turn the wort into alcohol beer.

738
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,700
And then I transfer that under pressure to a corny keg

739
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:36,440
when it's ready to basically drink.

740
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,980
It's almost ready to drink after that.

741
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,980
So it can take 10 days, two weeks,

742
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,740
which is a lot quicker than bottling.

743
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,460
I was surprised by that.

744
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,900
I guess I thought part of the brewing process

745
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,500
involved putting it in the bottle

746
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,180
and then having it sit in the bottle for a couple of weeks.

747
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,940
That actually improves the beer.

748
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,300
Certain beers, kind of Belgian beers, are very strong beers.

749
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,060
Or beers that take some time to mature

750
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,340
or their flavors to mellow can really

751
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,420
benefit from being in a bottle.

752
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,380
That's interesting, Wes.

753
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,620
We should take note of that.

754
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,380
Indeed.

755
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,420
But it's a lot more hassle.

756
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,220
You have to clean the bottles.

757
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,240
You have to individually prime them for carbonation.

758
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,660
And you have to then transfer the beer to each bottle, which

759
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,140
almost you may even have to transfer from the fermentation

760
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:24,020
bin to a secondary fermentation bin to let all the trube leave

761
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,300
at the bottom of the first bin.

762
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,420
Whereas transferring under pressure

763
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,380
from the fermentation vessel to a corny keg

764
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,740
is a single step process.

765
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,540
And you only have to clean the corny keg.

766
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,520
And it carbonates.

767
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,060
And you can adjust how much carbonation you want,

768
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,580
which for me is important.

769
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,100
That is a good tip.

770
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,860
So what I like about your setup is it

771
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,740
feels to me kind of getting into this again for the first time.

772
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,340
I feel like I'm totally starting over.

773
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:52,580
And your setup feels to me like it's, I don't know,

774
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,820
about a long-term setup.

775
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,100
But it's sort of like lessons learned

776
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,340
have gone into creating something that lets you just

777
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,320
brew beer whenever the fancy strikes you.

778
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,140
How does Linux play a role in that?

779
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,540
I used to brew beer with just a fermentation bin

780
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,820
under the stairs at house temperature, basically.

781
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,440
Yeah, that's what I'm familiar with.

782
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:11,940
Yeah.

783
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,940
And the quality is like, I don't know,

784
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,900
can I say it's like a 1970s porn film of beer?

785
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,100
I mean, some people have a thing for that.

786
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,740
Yeah, and it's fine.

787
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,940
But it just makes me think of rainy caravan holidays.

788
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,420
Whereas what really made the difference,

789
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:32,500
the quality increased like 1,000%

790
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,980
was when I controlled the temperature of the fermentation

791
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,320
process exactly, which is where the yeast is doing all its work.

792
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,420
And the yeast has to work at this optimum temperature.

793
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,860
And to control the temperature, I basically

794
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,340
used, in the beginning, it was this open source project

795
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,260
called BrewPi, which actually ran

796
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,940
on a little bit of firmware running on an Arduino Uno

797
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,180
that actually did, if you're familiar with PID,

798
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,820
like PID controlling, I think it's

799
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,900
like proportional integral derivatives.

800
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:05,260
And they basically, one sensor measures the temperature.

801
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,500
And then a couple of relays either turn on heating

802
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,040
or they turn on cooling.

803
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,260
And the PID part is the fact that because this big volume

804
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,740
of liquid, it can anticipate temperature changes

805
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,860
according to environmental conditions.

806
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:22,980
So you get within a tenth of a degree accuracy

807
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,360
of temperature controlling.

808
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,380
So you can basically, with the BrewPi, with the RaspberryPi,

809
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,980
and an Arduino, control exactly the temperature

810
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,340
of the fermentation process and monitor it.

811
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,580
So it's pulling in a weather API feed to monitor that?

812
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,980
The original BrewPi did it all on its own.

813
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,540
It was this self-contained unit.

814
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,380
BrewPi actually was so successful

815
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,900
as this individual project, they spun it into a business.

816
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,300
And they sell their kind of bespoke hardware

817
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,500
and closed source firmware now.

818
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,100
But the platform was popular enough

819
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:55,860
to be integrated into something called Firmantrack, which

820
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,300
is an open source project that integrates

821
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:03,100
a lot of that old open source BrewPi software

822
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,460
to work with the same hardware.

823
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:10,300
And more importantly, actually work with the ESP8266 devices,

824
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,220
low cost microcontrollers, and expands it.

825
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,100
It dumps PHP and makes it all modern REST frameworks.

826
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,020
So that all operates over a REST API,

827
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,900
which you can integrate with Home Assistant,

828
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,380
or you can push to the cloud, do whatever you want.

829
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,620
But it's basically the same PID algorithm

830
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,820
that's controlling the temperature of the fermentation.

831
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,300
Wow.

832
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,940
I got to just sit with that for a moment.

833
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,100
A REST API for brewing beer.

834
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,140
Yeah.

835
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,460
So it really sounds like what I'm

836
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,620
getting from what you've kind of described

837
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,740
is that controlling that temperature

838
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:45,180
is the secret to unlocking delicious great home

839
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,660
beer versus beer that's OK.

840
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,060
Yeah, it really is.

841
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,140
There are some yeasts that a yeast will

842
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,420
have an ideal temperature.

843
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,940
In centigrade, it could be like 21 degrees.

844
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,060
And you might even start low.

845
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:01,540
Like with a good pilsner, you might start at 18 degrees C.

846
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,820
And then after a couple of days, ramp it up to 22

847
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,660
and then drop it.

848
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:08,020
You might cold crash when there's no sign of any further

849
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,540
fermentation.

850
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,740
And you can check the amount of fermentation

851
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,900
that's going on with something called like an iSpindle, which

852
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,260
is it's not quite open source, but it's

853
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,180
a DIY project where the firmware can be downloaded and installed.

854
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,700
The code is accessible, but it has

855
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,220
one of those weird licenses attached to it

856
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,740
so they can try and make money off it.

857
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,980
Sure, you got it.

858
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,860
Have you experimented or done any kind of visualization

859
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,140
or graphing of the temperatures over time

860
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,660
just so you have something to look at data-wise?

861
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,580
Yeah, so Fermentrack does exactly this.

862
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,260
So there's usually two or three sensors involved.

863
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,540
And these are really simple $0.50 sensors.

864
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,140
They use like the one-wire protocol.

865
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,500
They do nothing extraordinary other than report

866
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,140
the temperature.

867
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,380
There's one for the inside the beer.

868
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,060
So you normally use a fermentation bin

869
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,980
with what's called a Thermowell, which is like a cylinder you

870
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,260
put straight into the beer.

871
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,380
And then the sensor goes right into the middle of the beer.

872
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,700
So you get the exact temperature inside the beer.

873
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,020
But you can also use the temperature on the ice spindle,

874
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,380
which can sit inside the beer.

875
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,780
That's the temperature of the beer.

876
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,180
Then there's a temperature inside.

877
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,540
Usually, you use an old refrigerator.

878
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,460
So you put the fermentation bin inside the refrigerator.

879
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,860
And so you get the temperature inside that and then

880
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,220
a temperature of the room, the environment outside that.

881
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,660
Those three temperatures together

882
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,540
are mulched in the algorithm to control

883
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,900
the temperature of the brew.

884
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,820
That is fancy.

885
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,700
Mulched.

886
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,860
That is so great.

887
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,420
Yeah.

888
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,740
And it turns that I put a little heater in the fridge.

889
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,060
This is all that I've done is there's two relays.

890
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,460
So a relay with a simple 5-volt signal from the Arduino

891
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,380
will turn on something or turn off something.

892
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,020
Two relays.

893
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,660
So one turns on the refrigeration.

894
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,460
The other one turns on the heating element,

895
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,460
which is just what in the UK you get them

896
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,260
for like summer houses or greenhouses.

897
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,980
It's a small, low-cost thing you can bolt

898
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,460
to the bottom of the fridge.

899
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,020
And so all of that, sorry to answer your question,

900
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,260
in Fermentrac and in Brusella before it, you can see all

901
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,380
of that in a chart to monitor exactly all the temperatures,

902
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,460
how things are going, and also put on top of that

903
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:12,380
the gravity of the beer, so how well it's actually fermenting,

904
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,180
how strong it's fermenting, and the alcohol content of the beer

905
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,100
as you go through it.

906
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,020
And then when that starts to flatline,

907
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,420
you know then you can dry hops the beer

908
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,500
if you're going to do that, or you can transfer it

909
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,140
to bottles or a keg.

910
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,060
All right, so then I have really kind of one really ultimate

911
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,580
question.

912
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,980
Looking back at the last decade or so of homebrewing,

913
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,700
all of these different things that you can do,

914
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,420
features you could do, what has helped the most?

915
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:40,900
And what would you tell past Graham if you could?

916
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,780
What advice can you pass along to us?

917
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,940
The thing that's really made a difference, I think,

918
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,420
with lots of things is the quality of the ingredients.

919
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,740
So the wort kits that you can get,

920
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:55,100
you can buy them separate with the malt extract

921
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,220
and with the kind of boiled down wort.

922
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,020
Don't kind of skimp money on those kits

923
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,020
if you're going to do it.

924
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,620
And of course, if you're going to brew and mash your own beer

925
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,100
even better, that's like the first step.

926
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,180
Get that right.

927
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,900
Follow the instructions for the yeast

928
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,820
because that's really important.

929
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,020
And then really bottle the stuff that's

930
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,500
really important, that's going to keep, that you want to come

931
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,700
back to.

932
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,340
But otherwise, the keg was the big innovation for me

933
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,260
because it speeds up.

934
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:25,180
You can set carbonation exactly as you want it.

935
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,660
You can speed up the fermentation under pressure.

936
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,460
So I brew everything under pressure.

937
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,300
I like that tip.

938
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,580
That does seem like a good one.

939
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,220
I actually wrote that one down on an actual piece of paper.

940
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,820
I'm like, I got to make a note and talk to Wes about that.

941
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,860
So looking back at it, do you have a favorite go-to beer

942
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,580
that you brew?

943
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,940
Well, I actually got into this after going

944
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,180
to Portland in the US and really getting hooked.

945
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,660
You know, there's got an amazing beer scene.

946
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,980
I've really got to taste that hoppy kind of West Coast

947
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,300
Portland IPA.

948
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,340
And in the UK, you just couldn't get it.

949
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,180
But I could buy the work kits.

950
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,220
I could ferment them here, and I could bottle them here.

951
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,140
And it was as close as I could get

952
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,580
to getting a pint of those West Coast IPAs on tap

953
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,060
here in the UK.

954
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,020
And that's what really got me into it.

955
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,900
And so I still really love going back to them.

956
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,820
But right at the moment, I've got a New Zealand Pilsner,

957
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,140
which is perfect as well.

958
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,060
I'm really enjoying it.

959
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,700
And the nice thing is you can change,

960
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,940
and it's a bit like being at the pub while the pubs are closed.

961
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,260
Indeed.

962
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,900
You're exploring the world while you can't travel through beer.

963
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,460
Yeah.

964
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:30,940
I love it.

965
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,940
Graham, thank you.

966
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,820
No problem.

967
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,580
I want to tell you about a special course

968
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,060
from our friends at a Cloud Guru.

969
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,700
We will have a link in the show notes.

970
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:44,340
It is the SUSE Linux Enterprise Admin Review and Exam Prep.

971
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,780
Is it time to become a SUSE Certified Administrator?

972
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,620
Well, they have the prep course for you.

973
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,100
It'll get you ready for the exam and final exam courses.

974
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,500
And they have all the information

975
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,940
you need to become prepared to get certified.

976
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,940
Exam prep courses are designed to be a review of the content

977
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,660
from each of the courses proceeding

978
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,280
to get you really kind of just set on the important points,

979
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,100
tips, and areas that will be an issue for an exam

980
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,120
in particular.

981
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,820
That's what these are kind of tooled for, including even

982
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,660
how to register and go get the final exam and all of that.

983
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,460
It's all covered.

984
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,340
We'll have a link in the show notes

985
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,780
to the course for our Cloud Gurus,

986
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,020
SUSE Linux Enterprise Admin Review and Exam Prep.

987
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,300
Graham has such an awesome setup.

988
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,180
After listening to that, I was like, yeah, we're definitely

989
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,140
going to be following some of this advice.

990
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,180
It was really nice to get his decade's perspective

991
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,420
on how to do this right.

992
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:38,820
Yes.

993
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,380
And I think he's hit a nice kind of sweet spot where it's,

994
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,260
you know, much like with audio, you

995
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,700
can kind of invest as much as you want in beer brewing

996
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,500
equipment, it seems, but we don't really need to do that

997
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,020
or have the space at the studio.

998
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,700
So finding the, like, dialed-in setup that just works,

999
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,260
gets good quality beer, but doesn't have to go crazy all

1000
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,740
out with, like, six different containers and systems

1001
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,260
and setups and transfers, that's what we were looking for.

1002
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,200
Yeah.

1003
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,940
So, you know, time passed.

1004
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,620
We let about three weeks go because we were planning ahead

1005
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,480
for LUP 400, but we didn't have a lot of time.

1006
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,020
And so we really didn't know how things were going to be.

1007
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,340
So Saturday came rolling along, and we showed back up

1008
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,900
at Gallagher's in Edmonds, Washington.

1009
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,180
Hello, Wes.

1010
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,620
It's been three weeks.

1011
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,540
It's been three weeks.

1012
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:23,960
Here you go.

1013
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,120
We got you a beverage, I guess.

1014
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,700
Look at that.

1015
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,200
Yeah.

1016
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,100
A beverage.

1017
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,060
That's colorful.

1018
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:28,980
Looks tasty.

1019
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,660
Clementine.

1020
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,180
Probably should have something besides beer today.

1021
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,140
I suppose that's true.

1022
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,580
And once we got in there, we knew, like, some things we were

1023
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,300
just so grateful were already set up,

1024
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,020
like their whole bottle washing system.

1025
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,620
Wow.

1026
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,380
Very nice.

1027
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,260
Made it way simpler to get up and get going.

1028
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,940
I'm going to get these started washing.

1029
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,180
You guys get those going.

1030
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,860
And over here, I'll bring you some more bottles out as well.

1031
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,340
All right.

1032
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:49,980
Thank you.

1033
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,020
I was doing the math last night.

1034
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,240
It seemed like we were clips, but I wasn't sure

1035
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,820
how many bottles we had.

1036
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,900
All I can think about is we got kegs.

1037
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,100
I'm so glad we got kegs.

1038
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,600
Me too.

1039
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,100
Why?

1040
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,640
Because it'll make this so much easier?

1041
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,140
Well, yeah.

1042
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,140
And then, like, we have kegs.

1043
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,860
Boy, did it make it easier.

1044
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,140
I mean, we didn't even have to fill the kegs ourselves.

1045
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,500
They just did it for us.

1046
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,020
I don't know if we would have thought of that if Graham hadn't

1047
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,060
said something.

1048
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,140
But one of the advantages of using Gallagher's really rad

1049
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:17,580
setup is we could dial in the carbonation in a way

1050
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,180
that we wouldn't have been able to do with a newbie setup.

1051
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,760
We're trying it out for the first time

1052
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,900
before we bottle and keg it.

1053
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,380
And I want to get Wes' first impressions.

1054
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,060
Smooth.

1055
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,860
There's definitely booze in there.

1056
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,060
And it's tasty.

1057
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,260
I think we decided it needs a little more carbonation, maybe.

1058
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,220
But other than that.

1059
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:35,720
I like it.

1060
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,380
I like it a lot.

1061
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,380
I think once we get a little more carbonation,

1062
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,100
it'll be perfect.

1063
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,260
But the flavor, the color, it's a beautiful beer.

1064
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,460
Look at that.

1065
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,020
Golden, it takes the light well, lights up the glass.

1066
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:51,180
I got to snap a picture of the first look at this beer.

1067
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,900
And with the help of their brewmaster,

1068
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,260
who kind of encouraged us to dial it up just a little bit

1069
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:55,820
more.

1070
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,860
Happened to be a Belgian fan himself.

1071
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,260
Yeah, we did it.

1072
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,780
We took the plunge.

1073
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,820
It doesn't look any more bubbly.

1074
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,200
So we're not going by appearance.

1075
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,020
We're going for that bite on the tongue.

1076
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,260
This thing minimizes the amount of turbulence that it gets.

1077
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:13,100
So you won't be able to see much of the foam there.

1078
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,580
All right.

1079
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,380
There you go.

1080
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,300
Let's give the updated version a try.

1081
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,100
Cheers, Wes.

1082
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,540
Cheers.

1083
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,340
And they had such a nice system, because what?

1084
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,020
It was like a carbonation stone they use?

1085
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,180
Yeah, they had a way to just force carbonate it.

1086
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,380
So you could dial it up as you want, right?

1087
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,140
Like, oh, you need a little more carbonation?

1088
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,780
Add a little bit more.

1089
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,700
They just run it right back through the system.

1090
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,940
And in, I don't know, five minutes, we could test it

1091
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,540
again.

1092
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,100
Yeah.

1093
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,620
And we did.

1094
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,220
Once we had it dialed in, first thing

1095
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,980
was to get the kegs filled up.

1096
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,180
And then we got to play with their super cool, like, beer

1097
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,660
wand to fill our bottles.

1098
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,220
So we're about to bottle, and we're benefiting from this cool,

1099
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,380
like, beer gun that they have.

1100
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,220
Yeah, it's hooked up to the CO2.

1101
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:51,940
It's carbonated.

1102
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,700
You can purge the oxygen from the bottle

1103
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,660
before you put any beer there to protect our precious brew.

1104
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,780
But surely one of us is going to make a mistake.

1105
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,260
Yep.

1106
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,340
Now it's just a matter of putting beer in bottles.

1107
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,260
So let's get to work.

1108
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,340
And we did.

1109
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:07,140
Nice that we kind of came up with a system.

1110
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,660
We traded off, on and off.

1111
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,020
You know, you filled it for a little while.

1112
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,460
Then I filled it for a little while.

1113
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,180
We would trade off from the box.

1114
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,380
It worked really well because they have everything plumbed.

1115
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,700
And so they had a sink there and towels there.

1116
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,340
That, I think, was the biggest experience difference for me.

1117
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,420
It's like, it's no longer me having

1118
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,300
to make a siphon and spilling beer all over the kitchen.

1119
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,340
It was just beer into bottles.

1120
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:30,860
I don't think we spilled at all.

1121
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,340
A drop.

1122
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,460
No, I was really proud of us.

1123
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,780
It saved all of that beer for us to drink later.

1124
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,940
And after slowly filling our bottles, which

1125
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,140
we had we got these swing top style bottles,

1126
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,460
we heard the most rewarding sound.

1127
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:51,020
That right there is the end of our batch.

1128
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,180
We nailed it perfectly.

1129
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,700
Two kegs, we got 27 bottles, and we ended up

1130
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:00,140
filling 26 because we drank a little bit of it.

1131
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,100
More than a little.

1132
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,900
Can you believe, though, we nailed it just right?

1133
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,940
And we did not plan this at all.

1134
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,820
That's pretty great.

1135
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,820
I mean, you did the math, but let's be honest,

1136
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,180
you're more like Python hacking.

1137
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,500
So this is perfect.

1138
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,440
We brought exactly what we can carry out,

1139
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,060
and it's just the right amount.

1140
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:19,820
Two kegs, 27 bottles later, or I guess 25 bottles.

1141
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,260
So we had a margin for safety.

1142
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,080
Now what we thought is we need to come up

1143
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,140
with a label and stuff for it.

1144
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:31,360
But now we've had a couple of days to try it out,

1145
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,020
or let it sit.

1146
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,940
It's been sitting in the bottles.

1147
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,380
And I think Belgium does kind of,

1148
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,380
you know, it benefits from sitting

1149
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,580
in the bottles a little bit.

1150
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,100
So you want to do your first honors?

1151
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,500
Oh, yeah, let's try this.

1152
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,620
So here, Wes, here, cheers to 400 more episodes.

1153
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,300
And let's give it a try.

1154
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,260
That tastes like delicious pride.

1155
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,700
I mean, it's legitimately a very delicious beer.

1156
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,580
It's something like 8.5% alcohol by volume,

1157
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,180
but because of, I think, dialing up the carbonation,

1158
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,220
you don't taste it that much.

1159
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,860
No, but it's not too carbonated.

1160
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,420
It's just easy to drink.

1161
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,820
Not too carbonated at all, which was so great about it.

1162
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,380
Because I was a little worried we might have overdone it,

1163
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,300
but absolutely not.

1164
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,780
I've done that in past beers.

1165
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,420
So yeah, I was a little worried, too.

1166
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,380
And it's not too strong.

1167
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,640
It's not crazy malty.

1168
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,900
It's just a nice, tasty, balanced beer.

1169
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,140
I really, really like it.

1170
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,060
Now we each have a keg, so that's great,

1171
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,060
because we had two kegs.

1172
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,740
And we have some bottles that we're

1173
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,900
going to be sending out to friends of the show

1174
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,740
and whatnot.

1175
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,980
But I want to name this thing.

1176
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,740
You know, for our 400th beer, because I

1177
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,160
think we're going to do this again.

1178
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,220
I thought we'd like to, each batch,

1179
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,500
have its own unique name and addition.

1180
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,660
So this is the 400th edition.

1181
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,420
And the 400th edition needs a name.

1182
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,300
So I've just opened up a straw poll.

1183
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,980
If you're watching live, it's strawpoll.me

1184
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,620
slash 42-89-57-61.

1185
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:52,780
Strawpoll.me slash 42-89-57-61.

1186
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:57,460
Go there and vote on what we should name the LUP 400 beer.

1187
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:00,140
We have a couple of contenders already we've selected for you.

1188
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,740
So you only have to pick from what we've already put there.

1189
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,820
Number one, and these are kind of randomized, I think,

1190
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:09,340
but on this list, the Unplugged Lugger.

1191
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,900
Now it is not a lager.

1192
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,420
That's why it's a lager.

1193
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,180
Yep.

1194
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:17,020
The Chug-a-Lug, the 400.

1195
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:17,780
Oh, classy.

1196
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,500
Yeah, sophisticated.

1197
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,620
Or maybe it's a Cadillac.

1198
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,260
I don't know.

1199
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:24,820
And then the See Ya Next Tuesday, because of the 8.5%

1200
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,120
alcohol by volume.

1201
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,860
So if you would, go over there and vote.

1202
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:31,340
And whatever the results are at the end of the recording,

1203
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,940
we will officially name our beer and then try

1204
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,340
to get some labels printed up.

1205
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,500
We need your help.

1206
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,140
So right now, the votes are open,

1207
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,780
and we will come back and see where things lie.

1208
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:46,500
Wes, this right here, what we're holding in our hand,

1209
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,880
you know what this is?

1210
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:51,060
This is a real physical product that we created.

1211
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,820
We did it, buddy.

1212
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,140
There's a lot of it, too.

1213
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,420
Yeah, cheers again.

1214
00:44:54,420 --> 00:45:01,280
Yeah, we wanted to get enough that we

1215
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,860
could send some to friends and stuff and do fancy bottles.

1216
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:06,300
And then the kegs, of course, which we can refill.

1217
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,660
And I could totally see us do this for the next Linux Fest.

1218
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,600
Oh, absolutely.

1219
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,220
Just a good supply of beer on hand.

1220
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,900
So we'd have a Linux Fest Northwest batch

1221
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,380
that would be kind of more of a Pacific Northwest early spring

1222
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,540
beer.

1223
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,360
Yeah.

1224
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,560
So I thought what would be great is

1225
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,620
if you want to have a virtual beer with us,

1226
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:28,900
we should have something special to celebrate LUP 400.

1227
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,220
It's a special occasion.

1228
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,180
It's a beer-themed episode.

1229
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,940
So go grab a special 400th edition beer stein

1230
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,140
at luplug.beer.

1231
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,300
Luplug.beer.

1232
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,320
Go have a virtual beer with our lug and Wes and I,

1233
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,540
and enjoy.

1234
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,220
It's just something to celebrate 400.

1235
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,780
It's not a challenge coin, not yet.

1236
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,780
But it is a nice-looking beer stein.

1237
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,420
Yeah, something that can join us all together as we share a glass.

1238
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,980
Also, how great is that, luplug.beer?

1239
00:45:58,980 --> 00:45:59,700
I mean,.beer.

1240
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,980
Can you believe that's a thing?

1241
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:02,700
It's like the one good thing to come out

1242
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,860
out of all these nonsense top-level domains.

1243
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,260
It is definitely a great one.

1244
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:08,740
Look at that.

1245
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,540
Isn't that great?

1246
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,780
So when is beer is tasty coming back, huh?

1247
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,400
This was it.

1248
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,780
This was it in spirit right here.

1249
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:16,380
This was beer is tasty in spirit for sure.

1250
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,160
So yeah, we did it.

1251
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,820
And it turned out fantastic.

1252
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,380
We're very happy with the results.

1253
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,460
And I think we're going to keep doing it.

1254
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:26,220
So we've been kind of collecting various used pieces of equipment

1255
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,420
to help us do this.

1256
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,300
Right, piecing together what we need.

1257
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,780
And then we're going to have to try to mix in as much Linux as possible.

1258
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,100
Yeah, I mean, Graham gave us some great tips for that.

1259
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,820
And then I think, too, like the sensors and some

1260
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:40,020
of the automating of the heat on and off and all of that

1261
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,620
can probably be tied into Home Assistant.

1262
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:42,300
Right.

1263
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,460
So there'll be some fun Home Assistant action there, too.

1264
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:45,300
Absolutely.

1265
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,840
There's all kinds of things we can do.

1266
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,180
And we probably will continue to play around with it.

1267
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:51,340
I also want to thank our members.

1268
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,260
Those of you who are part of our Unplugged Core,

1269
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,780
you make this possible as well.

1270
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,540
Thank you very much to our members at episode 400.

1271
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:01,540
I'm going to have something special for you in the near term future.

1272
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:05,100
So if you're not a member yet, you could always go to unpluggedcore.com

1273
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,500
and become one, because there's going to be some special benefits for our members

1274
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,740
in the near future.

1275
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:13,240
And we appreciate all of you out there for joining us.

1276
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,060
Wow, look at that.

1277
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:17,900
41 people in the Unplugged is incredible.

1278
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:22,140
Unplugged, you guys, thank you so much for showing up and being part of this.

1279
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,340
When we started this 400 episodes ago, it seemed a little crazy

1280
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:27,820
to just open up our virtual lug and let anybody chat.

1281
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:32,040
And then over time, a community developed to help moderate it and do mic checks.

1282
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,300
And then now, even we have the weekly Unplugged meeting

1283
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,380
that happens every Sunday.

1284
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,020
I mean, it's taken over.

1285
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:41,660
It's the show that isn't the show, and it happens every Sunday

1286
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:43,900
at noon Pacific in our Mumble Room.

1287
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,700
You can find it on our calendar, though, to get it converted

1288
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,980
in your local time at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1289
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:54,020
And the info for our Mumble Room is at linuxunplugged.com slash mumble.

1290
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,860
Mr. Payne, I think that's 400 right there.

1291
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,380
We did it.

1292
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,540
Can you believe it?

1293
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,460
Dang it, I think that means we have to start planning episode 500.

1294
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,300
Well, here we go.

1295
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,660
Here's the episode of 500, and here's maybe even 400 more.

1296
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:09,220
Thank you, everyone, who's been listening for even more than a couple of episodes.

1297
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,260
I don't know how you put up with us, but man, are we more grateful than ever for it.

1298
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,340
Thank you for listening.

1299
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:18,180
It really is humbling, but the community is the best part of the show.

1300
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:18,900
For reals.

1301
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,300
All right, everyone, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode

1302
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:26,860

1329
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,220
Thank you, everyone, thank you.

1330
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:38,020
Let's go to JB Titles and let's name our 400th episode.

1331
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,180
I thought before we wrapped up officially, though,

1332
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:42,300
at the end of the show, I wanted to kind of capture

1333
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,640
what we'd love to see by episode 500.

1334
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:48,860
We'll create a 400 time capsule right here.

1335
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,140
So Mumble Room, go ahead and tag me in the chat room

1336
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:54,560
if you have anything to add to our time capsule,

1337
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,620
starting with category number one,

1338
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,660
our aspirations for Linux.

1339
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,080
Now, it's off the top of your head,

1340
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,220
but our aspirations for Linux by episode 500.

1341
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:06,000
While you think, because I know I'm just throwing this at you,

1342
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I'll say a richer, thicker, more vital

1343
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,860
third-party desktop app ecosystem.

1344
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:15,780
Well, it's a nice thing to hope for.

1345
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:16,620
What do you got?

1346
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:17,560
You got anything?

1347
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,060
Maybe hardware or something?

1348
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:22,440
I would hope that Linux has continued to develop

1349
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:25,220
on mobile devices independent of Android,

1350
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:27,060
that whatever happens with Fuchsia,

1351
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,420
there's still Linux on phones,

1352
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,140
and that whatever we've got sort of nascent now,

1353
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,140
it's just a lot better by episode 500.

1354
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,900
Maybe, maybe I've got one in my pocket.

1355
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:36,980
Casey, you have one?

1356
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:39,220
Yeah, I think that we should be striving

1357
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,820
to completely deprecate X11.

1358
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:41,820
Ooh, yeah.

1359
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,740
That is definitely one.

1360
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,780
I was gonna mention it,

1361
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,980
but I'm thinking 500 weeks from now, we better.

1362
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,260
We really better.

1363
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,140
One would hope.

1364
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,840
Barker says better gaming, I agree.

1365
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,120
Number two, number two for the time capsule.

1366
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,440
Wes Payne, I'm gonna go with you first on this one.

1367
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,020
Where is Flutter?

1368
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:00,860
It's everywhere, it's everything.

1369
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,840
I mean, we're gonna be doing the show

1370
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,020
in an entirely Flutter-based environment.

1371
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,580
Okay, I'll go the other way and say

1372
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,700
that it really hasn't gone anywhere, I guess,

1373
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,580
because that's the only other angle I can play on that.

1374
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,580
Okay, but it's canonical, still using it.

1375
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,260
I mean, how long is five, give me an idea.

1376
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:21,400
500 weeks, that feels like a whole nother 50 years

1377
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,500
of internet time, to be honest with you.

1378
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,740
So I gotta say, no.

1379
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,980
I mean, that's 10 years.

1380
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,380
Yeah, I'm gonna say if they are, they're winding it down.

1381
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,780
That's what I'm gonna say.

1382
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:34,580
That's what I think.

1383
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:36,700
We'll see, though, we will see.

1384
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:37,940
What do you think, our podcast?

1385
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,580
What would you put in the time capsule?

1386
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:43,020
So I'm hoping that by the time we get further along

1387
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,820
that we have great tools for media production already,

1388
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:48,500
obviously OBS and all the podcasting tools

1389
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,300
and PipeWire coming on, but just making it easier

1390
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,760
for new users to get on board more quickly

1391
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,240
and making Linux a first-class citizen

1392
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,420
for streaming and media production.

1393
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,660
Hear, hear, what can we develop on PipeWire now

1394
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,640
that if PipeWire really does unify things, right?

1395
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,340
I want easier audio routing.

1396
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,820
Yeah, I mean, you're starting to see it, right?

1397
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,660
Carla is annoying.

1398
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,340
Well, you don't need Carla.

1399
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,860
You don't need P-A-C-T-L.

1400
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,740
You don't need QJack Cuddle or any of those things

1401
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:17,740
because you now have this unified interface

1402
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,480
in the form of PipeWire.

1403
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:22,540
The standard stuff that desktops have now have

1404
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,160
the opportunity to integrate those workflows.

1405
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,100
Neil, let's say you, by episode 500,

1406
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:31,660
will Proton be merged with Wine

1407
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:34,180
or will they still be kind of these two separate projects?

1408
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,820
There will not be a Proton project in 10 years

1409
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,540
because everything will be integrated into Wine.

1410
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,500
It may even, like, if I'm being super hopeful,

1411
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,220
we will need it a lot less.

1412
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,300
Yeah.

1413
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,780
Pycrash, you want machines loaded with Linux.

1414
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:50,140
Yes, I want to buy my next machine

1415
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:53,600
and to be loaded with Linux from the factory.

1416
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:55,620
Yeah, I know a place.

1417
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,440
You're here.

1418
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,520
I know a few.

1419
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,520
Smooth cheese.

1420
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,760
Smooth as Velveeta.

1421
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,280
Okay, what do you guys think, Mumble Room?

1422
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,720
You can kind of just jump in on this one.

1423
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,360
Will JB have switched to Matrix

1424
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:14,000
as their primary chat platform by episode 500?

1425
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,840
Yeah.

1426
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,680
Yes.

1427
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,500
Yes.

1428
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,340
I hope so.

1429
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,660
I just need JBot and it's done.

1430
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:19,920
We're an IRC bridge, of course.

1431
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,040
Everyone just says yes at the same time.

1432
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,200
Yeah, IRC bridge.

1433
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,480
We need a JBot rewrite.

1434
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,480
These are the things that I think are holding us up.

1435
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,880
I mean, we could probably bridge JBot to Matrix

1436
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,360
using IRC and just keep the IRC around as legacy.

1437
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,200
Yeah.

1438
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,040
Yeah, the IRC bridge is fine.

1439
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,040
It's just the thing is you'll have to get GeekShed

1440
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:37,880
to agree to it.

1441
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,180
Or move to FreeNode or something.

1442
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:42,500
So what do you think the desktop pain points

1443
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,240
are gonna be by episode 500?

1444
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,600
So this is a while out.

1445
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,120
What's still gonna be something that is a pain in the butt

1446
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,320
to get working on Linux?

1447
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,200
Okay, so there's some confusion going on here,

1448
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,040
at least in the chat room.

1449
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:52,860
Okay.

1450
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,280
Are we talking about in 500 episodes?

1451
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,120
No.

1452
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:55,940
Or are we talking about at?

1453
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,760
500. Okay, so that's only two years away.

1454
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,200
Okay, oh yeah, right, right.

1455
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,040
You're right.

1456
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:00,880
Yeah, that's only two years.

1457
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,240
You've been saying 500 weeks,

1458
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,080
and I'm like, that's 10 years from now.

1459
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:03,920
Well, you did that.

1460
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:04,740
You gave me that.

1461
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,580
I was so confused.

1462
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,420
Dang it.

1463
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,520
You said 500 weeks, and I'm like, that's 10 years.

1464
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,360
Yeah, you're right.

1465
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,760
Well, yeah, in total, it'll be 10 year run for the show

1466
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,080
at our 10 year run.

1467
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,280
So two years from now.

1468
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,560
Desktop Linux, main pain points.

1469
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,120
Adobe products on Linux.

1470
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:20,640
Yeah, Adobe products on Linux

1471
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,080
is gonna be the big pain point.

1472
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,520
I think it's gonna be more likely

1473
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,040
that Office comes to Linux

1474
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,880
rather than Adobe coming to Linux.

1475
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,680
By episode 500, I think there's gonna be Outlook for Linux.

1476
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,520
That's what I think.

1477
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,240
I think in two years, we'll have Outlook for Linux.

1478
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,560
They're just gonna rebase everything

1479
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,080
on like an Electron type thing.

1480
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,200
Yeah, it's gonna be Electron.

1481
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,640
It's already gonna move to Electron

1482
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,280
irrespective of anything else.

1483
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,280
So then they'll bring it to Linux too.

1484
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,920
That's exactly the fear I have.

1485
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,580
There'll be more and more Electron apps

1486
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,920
that will be really CPU hungry and resource hungry,

1487
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,160
so if you, it's flattened out, then we'll see.

1488
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,800
I think Flutter will only be on Android.

1489
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:01,360
I just want Python GTK for documentation

1490
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,200
because I can already see how much better it is.

1491
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,720
There's just no docs for it.

1492
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:06,560
Right.

1493
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,380
Cute though.

1494
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,220
Look at that.

1495
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,040
I'm like figuring it out on my own

1496
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,360
and I can't really get anywhere.

1497
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,960
I think it's fun to think about these things

1498
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,360
in a two year time span and then a 10 year time span.

1499
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,340
Like if you took, so that's also like,

1500
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,300
what if you doubled the run of the show?

1501
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,520
Then we're like, we can do a whole episode on this,

1502
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,960
but we have a couple of good, we have our aspirations,

1503
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,480
a guess where Flutter is, Proton gets merged into Wine,

1504
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,840
JB is switched to Matrix,

1505
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,520
which I think we could do in two years,

1506
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,840
desktop pain points still include Adobe products

1507
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,240
and multi-monitor.

1508
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,800
Last but not least, is the LUP LUG

1509
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,440
still self-organizing in two years?

1510
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,320
Oh, it will.

1511
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,160
And we've been still using Mumble.

1512
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,440
The Mumble developer should somehow, some way,

1513
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,520
be capitalizing all this clubhouse nonsense

1514
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,800
because it totally validates Mumble.

1515
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,000
And Mumble's a better way of doing it too.

1516
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,520
We just need like a web interface

1517
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,320
to drop into a Mumble room.

1518
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,380
There is a Mumble web interface.

1519
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,160
It's beta, but it is a thing.

1520
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,240
You need a nice trendy iPhone app too, right?

1521
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,360
And that Mumble doesn't have the same apps.

1522
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,800
Ideally, some VC money, I think, right?

1523
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,060
Yeah, and some of that VC cash.

1524
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,760
All right, thank you Mumble room.

1525
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,920
You're the best virtual lug.

1526
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,680
Thanks for joining us for episode 400.

1527
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:22,480
Wouldn't be 400 without you.
