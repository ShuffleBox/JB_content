00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 164 for September 27, 2016.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's changing up the format a little bit.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
By throwing your usual hosts out, and taking over by taking calls.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.000
The phone lines are open to be a part of the program. It's a free call, 1-877-347-0011.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.000
The number again is 1-877-347-0011.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
So this is a special edition of the Linux Unplugged program.

00:46.000 --> 00:55.000
Typically we meet as a virtual Lug, a virtual Linux group that comes together to discuss Linux.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
This week we're going to be changing it up a little bit.

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
If you listen to our new show User Era, that's a show hosted by Chris, myself, and Rekai the Beard.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
We talk about everything. We talk about life, and technology, and Linux.

01:10.000 --> 01:15.000
Last week we were having a discussion about how we could improve the network.

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
One of the things that came up is, for the longest time Chris has wanted to host, or at least have the network host, a call-in program.

01:23.000 --> 01:33.000
One of my long-time passions for a long, long time has been, I want to help people get started with Linux.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
You see, back in 2009, December of 2009, that was a big year for me.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
Les Brown, the Breitmotivator said, people change when they say, I've had it.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
I had one of those moments. I had one of those, I've had it moments.

01:48.000 --> 01:57.000
I reached my lifetime limit of how much Windows I could take. I couldn't install one more driver to a Windows box.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
I couldn't add one more Windows computer to a domain controller.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
I reached December of 2009. I said, I'm done. I'm done working on Windows.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
A lot of people said, you're an idiot.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
There are practical reasons why Windows needs to remain in the workplace.

02:16.000 --> 02:28.000
If you think you're going to go out and start a company and service only Linux machines and recommend to people that they only install Linux and that they don't ever use Windows on the bare metal, you're ridiculous.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
That can't be done.

02:30.000 --> 02:40.000
In fact, the number one hindrance I had to switching myself to Linux and starting a company in Linux is people telling me that it couldn't be done.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
People kept saying, you're arrogant.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
A couple of years in, it started to work out.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Then people said, you treat Linux like a religion.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
You need to be more practical. You need to be more reasonable.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
You can't treat operating systems like that.

03:00.000 --> 03:16.000
I think part of me just realized, and it's really in the last couple of years, that that's why AltaSpeed has never lost a customer since 2009.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
Because when clients switch to us, they know that we understand it's not just an operating system.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
That's where the pictures of your kids live.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
That's where the video of your children's birth lives.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
That's how some of you make a living.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
That's how some of you have entertainment after you get home from a long, hard day of work.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
You don't want to fight with your computer.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
There are some people that live out in the middle of nowhere, and the computer is their lifeline.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
It's their emergency communication.

03:45.000 --> 03:56.000
After years of people telling me you can't start a business on Linux, and after years of people telling me that you're too arrogant and you're too single-minded, you need to be more reasonable.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Now people are asking, how'd you do that?

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
How are you making so much money installing Linux and switching people to Linux?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
How are you doing that?

04:03.000 --> 04:10.000
And so this hour of the Linux Unplugged program, we're not going to have our typical discussion format.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
We're going to be taking questions.

04:12.000 --> 04:19.000
You can ask a question by calling 1-877-347-0011, and I'm going to try and answer those questions.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Now, those questions can be general questions about computers.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
They can be Linux-specific questions.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
They can be business questions.

04:27.000 --> 04:35.000
Anything that's on your mind as it tangentially relates to Linux and open source and business, we'll throw that in there, you can ask.

04:35.000 --> 04:49.000
And if I can't answer the question, if I don't know the answer, we have standing by our Linux Mumble Room, which are the people that usually meet here every week to have a discussion.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
So I'll say, hello, guys.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
How are you?

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Hello.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
It's the Mumble Room.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
It's good to have you guys here.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
Thank you so much for being part of this inaugural program.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
Glad to be here.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I'm hoping you guys can help me.

05:04.000 --> 05:11.000
Now, one small little technical issue I'm juggling is that the machine that the phone machine is connected to is actually the same machine that the Mumble Machine is on.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
And so I have to bounce between the Mumble Room and our phone lines.

05:16.000 --> 05:25.000
And so hopefully the Mumble Room will be a little patient with me as I make those jugglings.

05:25.000 --> 05:39.000
But yeah, I'm encouraging everyone to call and ask a question or tell us about your experience on Linux or, you know, something that's worked out with, you know, worked out very well for you.

05:39.000 --> 05:47.000
So joining us, starting off is Ben from Louisville, Kentucky, and he has a question about Awesome Window Manager in Arch Linux.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Hi, how are you, Ben?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Hi, how are you, Noah?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
Hey, good.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Thanks for taking time to be here with us today.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
So tell me a little bit about Awesome Window Manager.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
You've been trying that out, I take it.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
Yes, and I sent you a pic on Telegram of the error I'm facing.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
It's based around Lua, which is a stripping language of sorts.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Yes.

06:08.000 --> 06:15.000
And I have been trying to get this particular theme that I showed you the crash on to work.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
I downloaded it from GitHub.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
I did a git clone, et cetera, the past main and whatnot.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
And when I load up, I keep getting that error over and over and over again.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
I contacted the developer of the theme.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
He is a heavy as heck user of Awesome.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
And he wrote the theme, and I said, you know, dude, can you take a look at this for me?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
And he did.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
He was stumped as to what was going on.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
I was like, oh, okay.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
So I was like, okay.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
He most likely said it's the piano bar stuff in the theme.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
And I opened up the config file, took a look at it, and I was like, okay, what the heck is this?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
So, yeah, I'm not sure exactly how to fix it.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.000
So I kind of called in today to see what your suggestion would be.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Sure.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Or Chris's or whoever is hosting with us.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
Because truthfully, you know, I looked at that theme over and over again,

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
and even my friend Jamie tried to come by and look at it, and he didn't know what to do.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.000
So I was like, I don't know if I should look at another theme or, you know,

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
I just wanted to ask my question because, you know, I haven't dabbled much with Awesome,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
and I'm sure you guys haven't either.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
But I just wanted, you know, to get your advice and, you know, to see what could possibly be done.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
Sure.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
And that's what I did because, you know, I just – I've been dabbling with this for weeks,

07:34.000 --> 07:41.000
and I just couldn't figure out, you know, what in the world to do because how – I just, you know –

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah, no worries.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Let me ask you this.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
Do you have a copy of that script that you could send it – you said you sent it to me on Telegram?

07:47.000 --> 07:53.000
I sent you the picture, yes, but I can send you the GitHub link to it as well.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
That's fine.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Yeah, that would be great.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
And actually what I might do is I might throw that up into our –

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
Yeah, are you communicating with me on Telegram or are you in the chat room?

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
I can send it to you on Telegram.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Give me just one second.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Yeah, no worries.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
And what I'll do is I will throw that into the chat room, and I'll have our chat room and our

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
mumble room take a look at that script, and somebody there might be able to dig in.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
You got it?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Yeah, sure.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Not a problem.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Well, I've got you on Telegram, so –

08:23.000 --> 08:24.000
Okay, perfect.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
Let me get that over to you, and I'll see what they tell us.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
Sounds good.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
Well, what I will do is I will – obviously that's going to be a script-specific question, so what

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
I'll do is I'll throw that in the chat room and see if somebody there can't help you out with that,

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
and if they find an answer for you, then I will respond to that in Telegram, and of course we'll

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
post that answer in the show notes of this week's episode.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
So thank you very much.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
I thank you for the call.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
We really appreciate having you.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
1-877-347-0011.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
That's the number to call.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
We're going to answer your Linux questions.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
Linux questions, technology questions, or business questions.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
All of the above work.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
And joining us now is – who do we have here?

09:11.000 --> 09:15.000
We have – we have Roller?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Am I pronouncing that right?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Roller?

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
Yeah, and I'm Paulson Pfeiffer in the IRC.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Oh, cool.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Well, thanks for being here with us.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
How can we help today?

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
So I'm just calling to see if anyone's using Mageia.

09:27.000 --> 09:33.000
I switched to Mageia when Mandriva died, and that was sad for me because Mandriva was the

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
Linux that I knew – I grew up on.

09:36.000 --> 09:42.000
So is Mageia still good for Linux?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Let me ask you this.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
What are you trying to do with it?

09:46.000 --> 09:54.000
So I was just actually using it as a desktop just to do my office and just documents and

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
just normal stuff on.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Let me ask you this.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
What led you to Mageia to begin with?

10:01.000 --> 10:07.000
So when I was way younger, before I even knew anything about computers, my oldest brother

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
came from Portland, Oregon, where he was doing his – he was getting his PhD.

10:11.000 --> 10:18.000
So he ran the computer lab up there just voluntarily, and he learned all these different cool tricks

10:18.000 --> 10:25.000
about Linux, and he had a LAN party with Mandriva in Utah, and we had tons of people show up

10:25.000 --> 10:28.000
from, like, Idaho and all over the place.

10:28.000 --> 10:36.000
They showed up at his office, like, his practice for his chiropractor stuff, and they all came

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
and it was really cool to see everybody, like, not really know very much, and he just showed

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
up here.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
Here's, like, six different DVDs, and we're going to start installing them and see what's

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
going on and, you know, work through strange issues.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Sounds like a man after my own heart.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
So you're basically looking for a general office use kind of a Linux distro.

10:55.000 --> 11:03.000
Yeah, and by using it for general office stuff, I ended up deciding that, you know, I really

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
want to know what's going on behind the scenes, but I never really had a chance to learn that

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
before, so when I tried to dig into it, I found FreeBSD and, you know, forked off that

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
way.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Gotcha.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Well, I'll tell you what I would start with.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.000
I might start taking a look at Ubuntu Mate.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
Have you ever used Ubuntu Mate or played with it?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
No.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
I've just been, I went straight from Mageia to FreeBSD.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Okay.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
So I'll start with this.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
If you're looking for a general office distro, I might stick with something like Ubuntu Mate

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
because it's going to be a really nice, stable, clean, very polished operating system based

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
on Linux, and you're going to be able to do a lot with that, and I'll tell you why I would

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
choose a Linux distro over a BSD distro.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.000
You know, the BSD guys, they're great guys, and they have a really great competitive product

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
out there, and I think that there is something to be said about the community, the BSD community,

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
because they don't bicker as much as a lot of the Linux guys do.

11:58.000 --> 12:05.000
I think they have a much more cohesive product, but a lot of the day-to-day stuff, the reason

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
it works on BSD is because it's using a lot of the tools that we built on Linux, and then

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
they're just kind of importing those, and so you kind of shorthand yourself from a desktop

12:14.000 --> 12:20.000
perspective if you're trying to do a lot of day-to-day things on BSD, and I use BSD all

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
the time in data centers when it comes to things like FreeNAS.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
I think it's a great choice there.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
As far as a desktop distro, I might look at something like Ubuntu Mate.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
Now, if you want to dig in a little bit deeper, if you don't just want to stick the flash

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
drive in, install, and be done, if you want to dig a little deeper, what you might consider

12:36.000 --> 12:42.000
doing is playing with something like Arch, but Arch can be a little rough to get started

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
with, and so what I would recommend is taking a look at a distro called Antragos.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Have you heard of Antragos?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Uh-uh.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
Okay, so Antragos is a distro of Linux that is – it is essentially Arch.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Arch is basically you build everything yourself.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
You choose what the web browser is.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
You choose what the file manager is.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
You choose what the mail client is.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
It doesn't assume anything, and that's great for learning how things work because

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
you really have to dig in, and you – I remember the first time I used Arch, I had

13:09.000 --> 13:17.000
to load the application that I needed to read a fat file system, and it was just – it

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
was a very enlightening thing because it was a sobering thing because it was just something

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
I had taken for granted.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
When I stick my SD card in there, I can read files off of it.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
Now I have to go – I had to learn about what program specifically allowed me to read

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
that.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Now the nice thing about Antragos is it holds your hand a little bit.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
When you first boot into the installer, it will ask you.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
It will say, which of these web browsers would you like?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Would you like Chrome?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Would you like Firefox?

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Would you like Thunderbird?

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
Would you – and yeah, and it kind of walks you through, but it has enough pain that you

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
have to – it forces you to learn a little bit at a time.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
Right.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Does that answer your question?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
Yeah.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Yeah.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
That's great.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
That's what I stuck with BSD for was because I started to find where they were hiding all

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
the documentation.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
Obviously, they have a handbook, so they're not really hiding it, but once I started finding

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
where they were putting it all, I was like, oh, wow.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
Someone's taken a lot of time to write this all down.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
I should read it.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Exactly.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Exactly.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
Well, yeah.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
I would suggest you give Antragos a try.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Take a look at that and see how that works for you.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.720
If you don't mind, if we ever do this again, I'd love to hear back from you.

14:19.720 --> 14:24.240
Either you write in or give us a call back, like I said, if we do the episode again because

14:24.240 --> 14:27.000
I'd love to hear how that works out for you.

14:27.000 --> 14:33.760
Now, on Sunday on the Linux Action Show, we talked about a story from Lenovo.

14:33.760 --> 14:39.400
The story, if you hadn't heard, Lenovo – well, what we reported on Sunday and what actually

14:39.400 --> 14:43.340
happened, there was a little bit of clarity that has now come to light.

14:43.340 --> 14:51.420
That clarity is that Lenovo – as far as the story went on Sunday, Lenovo made a computer

14:51.420 --> 14:57.320
and just basically intentionally decided for it not to run Linux.

14:57.320 --> 15:02.240
I'm assuming that Ryan from Lawrence, Kansas, that is what – I'm assuming that's the

15:02.240 --> 15:04.240
premise of your call, right?

15:04.240 --> 15:05.240
Correct.

15:05.240 --> 15:06.240
Hey, no.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.240
Hey.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.240
Nice to talk to you.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.240
Yeah.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.240
Great to talk to you.

15:10.240 --> 15:13.600
What were your first thoughts when you first heard about the Lenovo story?

15:13.600 --> 15:16.280
Well, first off, I'm a little bit biased.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.720
People should know me from the show.

15:17.720 --> 15:25.900
It's me, Ryan, from System76, but it did really bother me when I considered what the

15:25.900 --> 15:32.840
implications of that Lenovo story were because people started coming out and saying, well,

15:32.840 --> 15:39.560
it's not really Lenovo's fault, it's Intel's fault, and so we shouldn't be raising our

15:39.560 --> 15:42.720
pitchforks and going after Lenovo.

15:42.720 --> 15:48.760
But that story struck me totally different because it means that not a single person

15:48.760 --> 15:56.840
over there gave enough of a shit about Linux users to be like, hey, we should test another

15:56.840 --> 15:58.120
operating system on this.

15:58.120 --> 16:01.520
So let me give you some – let me give you some clarification, see if this changes your

16:01.520 --> 16:02.520
opinion at all.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.640
What was reported on Sunday was that Lenovo made a computer that simply didn't work

16:05.640 --> 16:06.640
with Linux.

16:06.640 --> 16:12.160
In fact, what it actually is, Microsoft came to Lenovo and said, we want you to custom

16:12.160 --> 16:15.380
build us a laptop that meets these specifications.

16:15.380 --> 16:16.700
We want better battery life.

16:16.700 --> 16:17.780
We want better performance.

16:17.780 --> 16:18.780
We want better cooling.

16:18.780 --> 16:19.780
We want software RAID.

16:19.780 --> 16:22.200
We want all these things.

16:22.200 --> 16:27.000
And Lenovo said, okay, and took one of their existing model computers that you can buy

16:27.000 --> 16:31.800
at Best Buy and install Linux on and it will work fine, and they took that model and they

16:31.800 --> 16:37.760
called it the Signature Series and customized it for Microsoft, gave it to Microsoft, and

16:37.760 --> 16:41.600
then Microsoft sold it through the Microsoft online store.

16:41.600 --> 16:46.680
That specific computer has AHC turned off by default and so you can't install Linux

16:46.680 --> 16:47.680
on it.

16:47.680 --> 16:53.400
So my question is – my question back to you is, is that really what we're that upset

16:53.400 --> 16:58.960
about is that a computer custom built specifically for Microsoft and sold only in the Microsoft

16:58.960 --> 17:05.600
store and an alternative that is the exact same model computer but is more widely available

17:05.600 --> 17:10.120
and that one is available to install Linux, do we really have that much ground to be upset

17:10.120 --> 17:11.120
about?

17:11.120 --> 17:19.760
I think that my feeling on it is pretty straightforward.

17:19.760 --> 17:26.400
This is only a problem because people who wanted to run Linux bought a computer and

17:26.400 --> 17:34.080
they just assumed, you know, Lenovo is a good brand, in the past I've been able to install

17:34.080 --> 17:43.120
Linux on their machines fairly easily and so I'm going to buy it.

17:43.120 --> 17:44.560
I see where you're coming from.

17:44.560 --> 17:57.160
It does kind of bother me though that there's a – I guess if it's made to run Windows,

17:57.160 --> 18:05.080
well that's – I guess that's perfectly fine, you know, it just – since the revelation

18:05.080 --> 18:11.400
I would hope that it's updated to say, you know, something along the lines of somewhere

18:11.400 --> 18:17.720
in the documentation will not run a Linux operating system.

18:17.720 --> 18:22.280
Yeah, I mean I think that buyers have the right to be informed for sure and I definitely

18:22.280 --> 18:23.360
I thank you for the call.

18:23.360 --> 18:27.160
I think that they have the right to be informed.

18:27.160 --> 18:32.340
I just – I question if – and I'm the first person to say that everything should

18:32.340 --> 18:33.340
run Linux.

18:33.340 --> 18:35.760
If I bought a computer it's running Linux or I'm not buying it but I think when you

18:35.760 --> 18:42.320
go so far out of your way to make such a niche system for such a niche purpose, I feel like

18:42.320 --> 18:49.080
there is just – I just have a hard time getting completely bent out of shape and maybe

18:49.080 --> 18:50.080
that's just me.

18:50.080 --> 18:53.360
Maybe I need somebody to switch me more to Linux, make me more hardcore than I already

18:53.360 --> 18:54.360
am.

18:54.360 --> 18:55.360
Frank is with us from Stanford, Connecticut.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.360
Hi Frank, how are you?

18:56.360 --> 18:57.360
I'm good now.

18:57.360 --> 18:58.360
What's up?

18:58.360 --> 18:59.360
Hey, thanks for calling in today.

18:59.360 --> 19:00.360
How can we help?

19:00.360 --> 19:06.400
So sort of two questions but different.

19:06.400 --> 19:10.800
First one, so over the years I've collected enough hearts to sort of want to build a storage

19:10.800 --> 19:11.800
server.

19:11.800 --> 19:12.800
Got the easy part done.

19:12.800 --> 19:13.800
A bunch of hard drives.

19:13.800 --> 19:17.520
Kind of need a controller for them and I know that's the tricky part especially if you're

19:17.520 --> 19:18.520
looking at CSS.

19:18.520 --> 19:22.960
So I'm trying to figure out how to pick the right, you know, hard drive controller,

19:22.960 --> 19:27.840
host host controller for about eight spinning disks, pair each like they're western digitals

19:27.840 --> 19:28.840
but yeah.

19:28.840 --> 19:29.840
Sure.

19:29.840 --> 19:34.400
So you're looking to build an entire file server?

19:34.400 --> 19:39.680
Yeah and I've sort of got it in my head that quite possibly it may end up serving duty

19:39.680 --> 19:43.440
also doing VM work but main purpose is file server.

19:43.440 --> 19:46.640
So I already have a chassis and hard drives.

19:46.640 --> 19:51.680
So the chassis already had a motherboard but it's still old so I'm going to replace it

19:51.680 --> 19:52.680
anyway.

19:52.680 --> 19:53.680
Sure.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.040
But my big one is like well I've got eight drives and how the heck do I get them, you

19:56.040 --> 20:02.040
know, talking to the motherboard and patch experiences, you know, get a dedicated card,

20:02.040 --> 20:05.960
you know, something that hopefully doesn't do RAID or at least presents the drives to

20:05.960 --> 20:10.760
a problem with ZFS so it presents all the drives to ZFS and it can do its, you know,

20:10.760 --> 20:11.760
wonderful magic.

20:11.760 --> 20:16.160
Well I'll tell you what I did, Frank, is I had a, I just, I actually just got that building

20:16.160 --> 20:20.560
a file server in December and what I ended up doing was I bought a case that actually

20:20.560 --> 20:22.160
had a hard drive controller built in.

20:22.160 --> 20:28.720
Now as you pointed out, that backplane that connects all the drives then reports as individual

20:28.720 --> 20:33.000
SATA drives to the motherboard so there's a little PCI card that goes in the motherboard

20:33.000 --> 20:36.920
and that connects to this backplane and then those drives go in and then they're reported.

20:36.920 --> 20:39.720
Now there's a couple of nice things about that setup specifically.

20:39.720 --> 20:43.840
One is when I was looking for a motherboard I could just shop for the best possible motherboard

20:43.840 --> 20:46.600
and as long as it had a PCI slot I didn't have to count SATA ports.

20:46.600 --> 20:50.760
The second thing that's really nice about it is because all of the hard drive controlling

20:50.760 --> 20:55.480
mechanisms are handled on the chassis itself and on the controller itself on the case,

20:55.480 --> 20:56.640
I can do things like hot swaps.

20:56.640 --> 21:01.320
I can pull the drive out, put another drive in and let it rebuild, that kind of thing.

21:01.320 --> 21:06.520
And I will find, I can find a link for you and throw that in this week's episode show

21:06.520 --> 21:07.520
notes.

21:07.520 --> 21:08.520
Would that help?

21:08.520 --> 21:09.520
That would be great.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.520
Yeah, cool.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.400
Well thank you very much and I thank you for the call.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.440
Really appreciate having you.

21:13.440 --> 21:21.680
The number again, 1-877-347-0011, you give us a call and we will talk about Linux or

21:21.680 --> 21:25.200
business or computers or all three.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.700
We love chatting and this is a super fun program.

21:27.700 --> 21:33.120
Like I said, something a little different but I think it's fun.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.120
I think it's going well.

21:34.120 --> 21:38.960
We're going to have to make some changes to the audio setup I think because of the call

21:38.960 --> 21:42.280
quality and people, as I'm moving on from calls, people are thinking I'm hanging up

21:42.280 --> 21:49.320
on them and of course it's difficult to patch both the mumble room and the callers.

21:49.320 --> 21:51.440
My good friend Sean from Washington is calling.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.440
Hi Sean, how are you?

21:52.440 --> 21:55.160
Hi Noah, how are you doing today?

21:55.160 --> 21:56.160
Excellent.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.160
Thanks for taking the time to call in today.

21:57.160 --> 21:58.160
How can we help?

21:58.160 --> 22:03.460
So I have some friends back in Phoenix and they're starting a company and they're building

22:03.460 --> 22:04.460
a web application.

22:04.460 --> 22:10.080
It's going to be on Linux, use open source like Django and Ansible.

22:10.080 --> 22:14.040
My question would be what kind of business or technology advice would you want to give

22:14.040 --> 22:18.000
them like small business just starting up that you wish you could have given yourself

22:18.000 --> 22:19.480
when you were first starting Alterspade?

22:19.480 --> 22:26.840
I'll tell you the first thing I would tell myself is grow slowly.

22:26.840 --> 22:32.960
I actually – I probably erred – at first I erred too far on the side of growing too

22:32.960 --> 22:36.560
fast and then I erred I think a little bit on the opposite of that of growing too slow.

22:36.560 --> 22:40.240
So I'd say just take it one step at a time.

22:40.240 --> 22:43.380
The practical ramifications of starting a business are pretty simple.

22:43.380 --> 22:47.480
You can open up a checking account in your own name using your own social security number

22:47.480 --> 22:52.320
and you simply open the checking account with letters DBA, that means doing business as

22:52.320 --> 22:55.340
and then the name of whatever you want to call your company.

22:55.340 --> 22:59.300
What you do is every time you do work or any time profit comes or any time money comes

22:59.300 --> 23:04.280
in from that business, in this case web application, you put the money into that checking account

23:04.280 --> 23:07.160
and the only checks that – and all the money from the business goes into that checking

23:07.160 --> 23:12.280
account and only business expenses, only things that are directly payable from the business

23:12.280 --> 23:13.880
come out of that account.

23:13.880 --> 23:17.520
Then at the end of the month what you have left by definition is profit and so you can

23:17.520 --> 23:19.460
take that money home.

23:19.460 --> 23:25.040
You set aside a quarter of that to pay your taxes with and now you have money to spend.

23:25.040 --> 23:29.000
That's the practical tactical part of getting the business up and running.

23:29.000 --> 23:34.920
Now as far as advice like big picture type advice, one is I would stay away from any

23:34.920 --> 23:36.400
sort of debt.

23:36.400 --> 23:39.400
Debt in business is super, super risky.

23:39.400 --> 23:44.420
Business going into business, small business in and of itself is risky and so going into

23:44.420 --> 23:47.920
debt while you're going into business is all the more risky.

23:47.920 --> 23:51.880
The second thing I would say is the more you can increase your profit margin, the more

23:51.880 --> 23:55.200
you can get the spread up, the better the business is going to be.

23:55.200 --> 23:59.660
One of the ways that I have found to make AltaSpeed remarkably successful and why our

23:59.660 --> 24:03.400
profit margins are larger than many of our competitors is because we leverage very cost

24:03.400 --> 24:10.360
effective technologies and so instead of buying a $10,000 Cisco IP phone system, we are running

24:10.360 --> 24:18.800
free PBX and we have inexpensive SIP compatible standard phones that I bought used off of

24:18.800 --> 24:24.200
eBay and open source and Linux is a really great way to increase that spread, to increase

24:24.200 --> 24:29.480
that profit margin, you can gain a lot of traction if you leverage that software that's

24:29.480 --> 24:30.480
available to you.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.080
Another way we do it is we don't buy Microsoft Office.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.800
We don't own a single copy of Microsoft Office.

24:34.800 --> 24:38.820
We don't own a single copy of Windows 10 and so every computer that we issue to an employee,

24:38.820 --> 24:40.140
we're not paying that license fee.

24:40.140 --> 24:42.120
We're not paying that yearly fee to Microsoft.

24:42.120 --> 24:45.800
We're using LibreOffice because it can do all of the things that Microsoft Office, whether

24:45.800 --> 24:50.820
or not people want to admit that and so we do and all those things together have added

24:50.820 --> 24:55.080
up to a significant spread in our profit margin so we're fundamentally able to make more

24:55.080 --> 24:59.980
money and the third thing, if there's only one piece of advice that anyone would listen

24:59.980 --> 25:05.280
to me from business, it would be make sure that you're putting a tremendous focus on

25:05.280 --> 25:09.920
integrity because if customers see you serving them well, they are more than happy to write

25:09.920 --> 25:12.800
you a check for appreciation.

25:12.800 --> 25:16.160
If you go into it with the heart of I just want to make a lot of money, I just want to

25:16.160 --> 25:19.680
do a lot of things to make a lot of money, that's where I see a lot of people get themselves

25:19.680 --> 25:24.200
into a hurt because you start to lose sight of what's really important, that is you want

25:24.200 --> 25:25.960
to be helping and serving other people well.

25:25.960 --> 25:28.760
Does that answer your question?

25:28.760 --> 25:29.760
I think I'll…

25:29.760 --> 25:30.760
Absolutely, that was really helpful.

25:30.760 --> 25:31.760
Cool.

25:31.760 --> 25:32.760
And thanks again for calling in.

25:32.760 --> 25:33.760
It's really great to talk to you.

25:33.760 --> 25:37.920
Sean and I met actually in a hotel at like three in the morning.

25:37.920 --> 25:42.840
It was at Linux Fest Northwest a couple of years ago and we just started talking about

25:42.840 --> 25:51.400
Linux and Sean is a great guy and has a very successful career in Linux and we've been

25:51.400 --> 25:55.280
friends ever since and so it's really good to be able to chat with him for a little bit

25:55.280 --> 25:59.880
if you caught the familiarity there.

25:59.880 --> 26:02.280
Who do we have here?

26:02.280 --> 26:03.280
Frank from Canada.

26:03.280 --> 26:04.280
Hi, Frank.

26:04.280 --> 26:05.280
How are you?

26:05.280 --> 26:06.280
Oh, hey.

26:06.280 --> 26:08.280
This will be our first international call.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.280
How can we help today?

26:09.280 --> 26:10.280
Okay.

26:10.280 --> 26:26.880
I bought a new computer finally about a year ago, an i5 with a 970 Strix Asus video card.

26:26.880 --> 26:33.400
In short, when I install NVIDIA drivers, the reboot goes from about 15 seconds to about

26:33.400 --> 26:35.400
three minutes.

26:35.400 --> 26:42.520
I've tried this on Kubuntu 16.04, Mate and Neon.

26:42.520 --> 26:47.400
Does it sound familiar at all?

26:47.400 --> 26:48.400
It does.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.400
It sounds very familiar.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.400
I'll tell you what.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.720
I have not had any luck shorting the boot time with Ubuntu.

26:53.720 --> 27:03.200
I had a very nice, very powerful Linux laptop and I had the stock driver, just regular driver,

27:03.200 --> 27:05.760
and that thing booted in like four seconds flat.

27:05.760 --> 27:10.120
I mean, it was incredible and I think part of that was it had an M.2 drive in it.

27:10.120 --> 27:16.800
I loaded the NVIDIA driver on that thing and it slowed down to probably, I mean, at least

27:16.800 --> 27:19.000
30 seconds, if not more, from a cold boot.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.200
I mean, it was absolutely unbearable.

27:22.200 --> 27:25.760
Part of it is I didn't care a whole lot because I'm not one of those people that shuts his

27:25.760 --> 27:26.760
laptop down.

27:26.760 --> 27:29.640
I just close the lid, let it go to standby, and then I bring it back up.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.180
Lately, actually, with 16.04, there's actually a new bug.

27:32.180 --> 27:36.920
If you have a Skylake machine, there's a bug with the NVIDIA driver where if you try to

27:36.920 --> 27:40.520
encrypt the hard drive, you can't use the NVIDIA driver, it just won't boot.

27:40.520 --> 27:44.700
It gets to the desktop and then it just, you get that little brrm and then you try and

27:44.700 --> 27:47.960
log in and then it just goes back to the brrm and you can't log in.

27:47.960 --> 27:52.960
The only luck I've had with getting faster boot times and using the NVIDIA driver is

27:52.960 --> 27:53.960
using Antragos.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.760
Have you ever heard of Antragos or played with it?

27:55.760 --> 27:56.760
Yeah.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.360
No, never played with it though.

27:58.360 --> 27:59.360
Okay, so...

27:59.360 --> 28:03.480
Is this exclusive to 16.04?

28:03.480 --> 28:04.480
As far as I know...

28:04.480 --> 28:08.760
I've got a 14.10 machine and it reboots like, quickly split.

28:08.760 --> 28:11.080
Yeah, I don't have any 14.10 machines.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.080
I have a 14.04 machine, that same thing, it's very fast.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.280
As far as I'm aware, it's a 16.04.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.120
Here's another thing you might try.

28:18.120 --> 28:22.360
A lot of the issues that I've had in 16.04, namely wireless, because we all know that

28:22.360 --> 28:27.760
wireless doesn't work in 16.04, have been actually fixed by Ubuntu Mate.

28:27.760 --> 28:31.960
You might try Ubuntu Mate and see if that doesn't fix the NVIDIA driver problem.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.600
I don't actually have...

28:33.600 --> 28:37.680
Most of my Mate desktops are machines that are a little underpowered and so that's why

28:37.680 --> 28:39.240
I'm using the Mate desktop to begin with.

28:39.240 --> 28:46.760
I don't have any NVIDIA cards that are installed in any Mate boxes, but I would give that a

28:46.760 --> 28:47.760
shot.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.440
I would give Ubuntu Mate a shot and see if that doesn't fix your problem.

28:49.440 --> 28:53.400
If that doesn't fix your problem, then I would start looking at Antragos.

28:53.400 --> 28:59.880
As I was explaining to a guy earlier today, Antragos is basically as easy to use as Ubuntu,

28:59.880 --> 29:04.080
but has all of the power and stability and flexibility of Arch.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.120
Does that help you?

29:06.120 --> 29:08.120
So you're using YUM instead of APT?

29:08.120 --> 29:14.080
You're using actually Packer, P-A-C-K-E-R, instead of APT or YUM.

29:14.080 --> 29:20.320
The command line syntax is a little bit different because there are flags.

29:20.320 --> 29:23.480
For example, when you go to install, like if you're installing on Ubuntu, it would be

29:23.480 --> 29:29.200
apt-get install Firefox.

29:29.200 --> 29:36.560
In Antragos, you would type something like packer-s and then you would search for something

29:36.560 --> 29:37.560
like Firefox.

29:37.560 --> 29:43.200
I'm sorry, small s, capital S will search, just a small s will install.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.200
You can actually...

29:44.200 --> 29:46.120
I have a cheat sheet.

29:46.120 --> 29:50.320
If you head over to jupiterbroadcasting.com, click on the contact link up at the top bar,

29:50.320 --> 29:54.040
and click on Ask Noah and shoot me your contact information so I can get in contact with you.

29:54.040 --> 29:58.040
I actually have a little cheat sheet that I use when I first started using Antragos

29:58.040 --> 30:02.680
on the how do I get commands going, how do I get things started, how do I install things,

30:02.680 --> 30:03.960
how do I remove things, those things.

30:03.960 --> 30:06.320
I'd be happy to send that over to you if it helps you.

30:06.320 --> 30:07.320
Okay.

30:07.320 --> 30:10.160
So I just find that on the Jupiter Broadcasting website?

30:10.160 --> 30:11.160
Yep.

30:11.160 --> 30:17.800
jupiterbroadcasting.com, up at the top, click on contact and then Ask Noah.

30:17.800 --> 30:21.680
Now he brought up something kind of interesting.

30:21.680 --> 30:30.320
We were talking a little bit ago about 16.04 and computers that don't run stock, aren't

30:30.320 --> 30:34.800
designed to run Linux, and so they've had all of these little weird things.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.520
One of the things that I should have asked Ryan about this while he was there because

30:37.520 --> 30:45.160
he works for System76 is they have some pretty amazing machines that just work right off

30:45.160 --> 30:48.240
the bat with Linux.

30:48.240 --> 30:52.040
And so they actually, my Oryx, even though 16.04 is problematic, they were actually able

30:52.040 --> 30:58.360
to fix a lot of that, and it is super appreciated, and that's not even a sponsor spot.

30:58.360 --> 30:59.760
That's just how cool they are.

30:59.760 --> 31:03.320
They just do that thing all on their own, and it's amazing.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.640
Okay.

31:04.640 --> 31:05.640
Let's see here.

31:05.640 --> 31:06.640
Who do we have here?

31:06.640 --> 31:08.920
Next, we have Eric from Indianapolis.

31:08.920 --> 31:11.000
Eric, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Hello, Noah.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.880
Great to talk to you.

31:13.880 --> 31:14.880
Great to talk to you, too, sir.

31:14.880 --> 31:15.880
How can we help?

31:15.880 --> 31:22.840
So I'm a fellow podcaster myself, and I want to start starting it back up, and I want to

31:22.840 --> 31:26.720
do some interviews, kind of like what you guys have been doing, and I've heard great

31:26.720 --> 31:31.080
things about podcasters, so I want to give that a shot, but I also wondered if there's

31:31.080 --> 31:35.760
an easy way to share my desktop with the person I'm interviewing so that we could like go

31:35.760 --> 31:40.720
over some websites or some programming code, and if Meet.jitsi might be a good fit for

31:40.720 --> 31:41.720
that.

31:41.720 --> 31:44.880
Yeah, actually, Meet.jitsi has a screen sharing app, so there's a couple different ways you

31:44.880 --> 31:46.160
can tackle this.

31:46.160 --> 31:49.640
The first way is a lot of people use Hangouts.

31:49.640 --> 31:53.340
Now, they've discontinued Hangouts on Air, but to the best of my knowledge, that regular

31:53.340 --> 32:00.960
Hangouts is still a thing, and there's a disproportionate amount of people that are doing internet communication,

32:00.960 --> 32:04.760
voice communication, video conferencing over Hangouts, and that is perfectly accepted.

32:04.760 --> 32:09.800
Basically, what Chris does, you have to understand something about Chris, guys.

32:09.800 --> 32:12.920
Chris goes and finds whatever everyone else is doing, and he says, how can we do it just

32:12.920 --> 32:13.920
a little bit better?

32:13.920 --> 32:16.280
How can we get our video quality a little bit higher?

32:16.280 --> 32:18.720
How can we get the audio quality a little bit higher?

32:18.720 --> 32:23.960
It's that little bit of extra silver lining, which is why Jupiter Broadcasting remains one

32:23.960 --> 32:35.940
of the largest, best networks out there, and I'm just getting messages, yes, regular Hangouts

32:35.940 --> 32:38.520
is still a go, so that's one way you can do it.

32:38.520 --> 32:42.600
The second thing you can do is Meet.jitsi, which does have a screen sharing ability.

32:42.600 --> 32:46.560
Now, I've not tried it myself, but everything else in Meet.jitsi has worked so well that

32:46.560 --> 32:52.880
I'm going to go ahead and stick my neck out for them and say that I bet it will work just

32:52.880 --> 32:53.880
fine.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.960
The third thing you can do, and how we do it at Jupiter Broadcasting, is there are these

32:56.960 --> 33:03.320
small little USB devices that you can buy from a company called Madwell, M-A-G-E-W-E-L-L.

33:03.320 --> 33:07.900
They're about $300, and they're on Amazon, and basically what it is is an HDMI capture

33:07.900 --> 33:11.600
card that plugs into USB natively compatible with Linux.

33:11.600 --> 33:15.560
It actually presents itself to the system the same way a webcam would, a video for a

33:15.560 --> 33:20.240
Linux device, V4L, and the nice thing about that is you can pull it into any piece of

33:20.240 --> 33:21.240
software you want.

33:21.240 --> 33:24.760
You can pull it into OBS if you're doing podcasting, you can pull it into VLC and record,

33:24.760 --> 33:29.120
you can pull it into, I mean, you name it, if Linux can see it, you can pull that device

33:29.120 --> 33:30.120
in.

33:30.120 --> 33:35.200
One of the things that I have done is if I am conferencing with somebody, I will take

33:35.200 --> 33:40.720
my laptop, which has an HDMI out, plug the HDMI out into the Madwell in, plug the Madwell

33:40.720 --> 33:47.200
back into my laptop, and now one of my second display, quote-unquote, becomes a captured

33:47.200 --> 33:52.480
thing that I can send out of a Skype window or through OBS or through Hangouts or whatever.

33:52.480 --> 33:55.040
It just becomes another video input.

33:55.040 --> 33:58.080
So that might be something you could take a look with.

33:58.080 --> 34:00.560
Any one of those three sound like they might work for you?

34:00.560 --> 34:02.120
Yeah, definitely.

34:02.120 --> 34:04.600
I think the Meet.Jitsi one might be the simplest.

34:04.600 --> 34:09.920
I think my question was I would have to make sure that they're on mute on Meet.Jitsi so

34:09.920 --> 34:14.960
that Zencastr doesn't have a conflict with that, right?

34:14.960 --> 34:19.880
Yeah, both of them you can shut off, various parts of it, so you can disconnect, you can

34:19.880 --> 34:26.040
turn off your camera, you can turn off your microphone or whatever, so you can kind of

34:26.040 --> 34:31.240
pick and choose which parts you want to pull from various services, yeah.

34:31.240 --> 34:32.240
Okay.

34:32.240 --> 34:36.360
Yeah, I think I'll try that first, but then if that doesn't work out, I like the idea

34:36.360 --> 34:41.080
of having the hardware capture device, and my primary device for recording it would

34:41.080 --> 34:47.280
be a laptop that's ironically a Lenovo ThinkPad even after all the crazy crap that's happened

34:47.280 --> 34:48.280
with Lenovo lately.

34:48.280 --> 34:51.000
But it's been a rock-solid laptop for recording.

34:51.000 --> 34:56.920
I was able to take it to a conference and did some interviews there on site with a lot

34:56.920 --> 35:03.680
of the equipment that you guys have recommended, like the Electrovoice microphone, the PreSonus

35:03.680 --> 35:05.680
USB mixer.

35:05.680 --> 35:10.080
It's been really well done, so thank you guys for recommending such great hardware.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.080
Yeah.

35:11.080 --> 35:12.080
Yeah, I'd appreciate it.

35:12.080 --> 35:13.080
Thank you very much for the call.

35:13.080 --> 35:16.080
I appreciate having you.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.720
I tell you what, those PreSonus stuff, that's what I'm using right now.

35:18.720 --> 35:26.200
I have a RE20 and I have a PreSonus audio interface, and that thing is sweet, absolutely

35:26.200 --> 35:32.680
sweet and works very, very well and is actually pretty cost-effective, all things considered.

35:32.680 --> 35:38.560
We've gotten to a point where you can get a pretty decent audio setup in almost no time

35:38.560 --> 35:39.560
at all.

35:39.560 --> 35:44.400
One of the things I was doing was a couple of days ago, I was on Facebook, and this guy

35:44.400 --> 35:46.640
is challenging me to switch him to Linux.

35:46.640 --> 35:50.160
He's kind of like taunting me.

35:50.160 --> 35:53.120
And eventually, it got to a point where I said, listen, I drove all the way to West

35:53.120 --> 35:56.800
Virginia and that guy was already switching to Linux.

35:56.800 --> 36:00.640
And so if you think I won't come to wherever he is, I won't tell you where he is, but if

36:00.640 --> 36:04.320
you don't think I'll come to, and then I said his location, then you're dead wrong.

36:04.320 --> 36:06.600
And joining us right now is Chris from West Virginia.

36:06.600 --> 36:07.600
Hey, Chris, welcome back.

36:07.600 --> 36:08.600
Hey, Noah.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.600
How you doing?

36:09.600 --> 36:10.600
Long time, no talk.

36:10.600 --> 36:11.600
How have you been?

36:11.600 --> 36:12.600
How's that school going?

36:12.600 --> 36:14.600
How are those kids working out?

36:14.600 --> 36:19.600
All those kids are surprising me every day, how fast they take to it, what they've done

36:19.600 --> 36:20.600
with it.

36:20.600 --> 36:25.940
And the high school has already purchased, well, they've already got the purchase order

36:25.940 --> 36:30.360
going to purchase the machine so that we can start doing it there.

36:30.360 --> 36:31.360
That's awesome.

36:31.360 --> 36:36.360
So I'm really excited to see what those high school kids can do because they are just,

36:36.360 --> 36:40.700
what they do with what they've got, if you recall, seeing what they had.

36:40.700 --> 36:43.080
They do amazing things with what they have.

36:43.080 --> 36:48.800
When they get OBS and Linux going, they're going to knock the socks off of me, I'm sure.

36:48.800 --> 36:51.160
That is definitely awesome and thank you very much for what you're doing.

36:51.160 --> 36:52.160
How can we help today?

36:52.160 --> 36:55.120
Well, I actually have two questions.

36:55.120 --> 36:58.680
The first one is really small, if you don't mind.

36:58.680 --> 37:02.880
From a business standpoint, you know that I'm trying to start my own and that seems

37:02.880 --> 37:04.720
to be moving right along.

37:04.720 --> 37:10.680
How well does Simple help scale when you're talking large number of computers, say multiple

37:10.680 --> 37:11.680
thousands?

37:11.680 --> 37:12.680
Do you have that many?

37:12.680 --> 37:14.720
Have you seen that?

37:14.720 --> 37:17.080
I have not used it at the scale of thousands.

37:17.080 --> 37:24.440
I will tell you that their sales team seems to have no concerns selling it as a large

37:24.440 --> 37:26.480
scale solution.

37:26.480 --> 37:27.960
So I certainly wouldn't be hesitant.

37:27.960 --> 37:38.300
I'll tell you, if I was really worried about it, if I had like 10,000 people and I absolutely

37:38.300 --> 37:43.320
had to have control of all those computers, at some point it does make sense to go and

37:43.320 --> 37:47.280
take another look at TeamViewer.

37:47.280 --> 37:48.440
Neither of them are open source.

37:48.440 --> 37:50.640
I don't think you're really giving up a whole lot one way or the other.

37:50.640 --> 37:55.560
My memory serves, the way that TeamViewer licenses is per technician.

37:55.560 --> 37:59.960
So I think it's kind of expensive, it's like $1,500 or $2,000 or something like that.

37:59.960 --> 38:04.080
But you could install, theoretically, and at least my understanding is you could install

38:04.080 --> 38:08.400
all 10,000 computers on TeamViewer, you would just be the only one to control it.

38:08.400 --> 38:13.240
So the cost goes up as you have more technicians, not necessarily as you have more clients.

38:13.240 --> 38:14.240
Does that make sense?

38:14.240 --> 38:15.240
Yes.

38:15.240 --> 38:19.960
To toot my own horn and say I'm going to have thousands, that's, yeah, I'm shooting for

38:19.960 --> 38:20.960
the moon there.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.200
I don't know about that.

38:22.200 --> 38:27.320
But I think that as you get into it, I think you're going to find that if you go out there

38:27.320 --> 38:31.280
with the right attitude and you serve people well, and you're willing to charge a fair

38:31.280 --> 38:35.200
price and do good, honest work, I think you're going to have people flock into you.

38:35.200 --> 38:38.560
I would not be surprised if you have a thousand people that you're going to need to support.

38:38.560 --> 38:45.720
Well, I do support somewhere in the neighborhood of 7,000 computers in the county school system.

38:45.720 --> 38:46.720
Exactly.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.920
We have a proprietary Microsoft thing.

38:48.920 --> 38:57.640
The second question, from your standpoint, how do you convince a business owner, let's

38:57.640 --> 39:02.040
say you've taken on a new client and he's a small business owner, I don't know, say

39:02.040 --> 39:04.360
five machines.

39:04.360 --> 39:13.800
And from your perspective, how do you convince him that Linux is a better a better fix for

39:13.800 --> 39:14.800
his business?

39:14.800 --> 39:19.240
I mean, you and I, and most of the people listening obviously, know that it's probably

39:19.240 --> 39:20.240
the better choice.

39:20.240 --> 39:21.240
Sure.

39:21.240 --> 39:27.220
But if I'm a small business owner and I've been using Microsoft and QuickBooks for five

39:27.220 --> 39:34.400
plus years and it's just working for me, and you present this to me in my eyes, oh my goodness,

39:34.400 --> 39:38.440
I've never heard of this, this could possibly destroy my business, I don't know what makes

39:38.440 --> 39:39.440
that sale.

39:39.440 --> 39:43.360
So what I do is I approach every client with the assumption that the client is smarter

39:43.360 --> 39:49.480
than I am and they know better how their business works than I do.

39:49.480 --> 39:57.440
And then based on that, what I do is I make my sale catered around what is going to benefit

39:57.440 --> 40:00.040
them and what is going to be in their best interest.

40:00.040 --> 40:05.440
Now, I'll stop and tell you, I don't waste a whole lot of time trying to, my grandma

40:05.440 --> 40:10.920
used to say those who are, what's the phrase, those who are convinced against themselves

40:10.920 --> 40:13.800
remain of the same opinion still, something like that.

40:13.800 --> 40:18.680
You can't, if somebody is dead set against something, sometimes you're just not going

40:18.680 --> 40:21.200
to convince that person.

40:21.200 --> 40:26.640
They want to be stuck in the mud, they want to be ignorant, and sometimes you're just

40:26.640 --> 40:29.140
not, there's just not much you can do for those kind of people.

40:29.140 --> 40:35.200
And when we do initial consultations, consultations, seems like that sometimes, when we do initial

40:35.200 --> 40:39.940
consultations, one of the things that we mandate from our clients, and I've turned clients

40:39.940 --> 40:45.960
down for this, is they have to be willing to allow us to make technical decisions where

40:45.960 --> 40:48.600
we feel strongly see it fit.

40:48.600 --> 40:55.440
And you know, if I am not, I am not going to be someone's paid monkey hands.

40:55.440 --> 41:00.180
If you want somebody to walk in there and just do the work that you want, you want done,

41:00.180 --> 41:01.440
there are plenty of companies that'll do that.

41:01.440 --> 41:02.440
That's not us.

41:02.440 --> 41:04.080
We craft solutions for people.

41:04.080 --> 41:07.640
We craft cost-effective solutions without compromising quality.

41:07.640 --> 41:10.240
That's what, if you call our 1-800 number, that's the message that we'll read.

41:10.240 --> 41:13.400
It'll say we provide innovative solutions without compromising quality.

41:13.400 --> 41:18.200
We take the same quality that you would get from a Wirecast machine with a $4,000 Mac,

41:18.200 --> 41:20.600
and we will build the exact same quality machine.

41:20.600 --> 41:23.160
It might look a little different, might behave a little different, but you're going to

41:23.160 --> 41:26.020
get the same result, except we're going to do it with Linux, and we're going to do it

41:26.020 --> 41:28.420
for a tenth of the price.

41:28.420 --> 41:34.600
And if you don't want that kind of solution crafting, we are not the right fit for you.

41:34.600 --> 41:39.600
So to some degree, you have to decide as a business owner, how do I want to sell myself

41:39.600 --> 41:42.160
and what kind of clients do I want to work for?

41:42.160 --> 41:45.680
And then once you have that decided, then you go in and you start looking at the advantages

41:45.680 --> 41:46.680
to them.

41:46.680 --> 41:47.680
So I'll give you an example.

41:47.680 --> 41:52.320
We had a church that was broadcasting using a, it wasn't Wirecast, it was an alternative

41:52.320 --> 41:56.360
software, and basically we went in and said, hey, listen, you're doing this wedding.

41:56.360 --> 41:59.600
This is coming up in a couple months, and you're going to be using this software.

41:59.600 --> 42:03.440
And the problem is, this really isn't up to being able to switch cameras.

42:03.440 --> 42:06.960
It didn't have enough horsepower to handle the amount of video inputs we wanted.

42:06.960 --> 42:12.400
So, you know, we can throw together a box for you for a tenth of what you paid for that,

42:12.400 --> 42:13.800
and we'll be able to stream that out.

42:13.800 --> 42:17.200
You'll be able to stream 1080p because they were using standard definition.

42:17.200 --> 42:20.840
You'll be able to use USB cameras if you want like a camera angle of the drummer, you want

42:20.840 --> 42:23.440
a camera angle of the worship team or something like that.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.560
It's going to be really cheap to get additional camera angles.

42:25.560 --> 42:30.360
Plus, we can take your existing video camera if you want to use it, it's SD, but we can

42:30.360 --> 42:34.880
apply it, we can use a converter and pull that in because that lens shot all the way

42:34.880 --> 42:40.840
down the sanctuary and hit the podium, and they spent a lot of money on it even though

42:40.840 --> 42:41.840
it wasn't HD.

42:41.840 --> 42:44.160
Really, people aren't watching to get high video quality, right?

42:44.160 --> 42:45.160
They just want to see the service.

42:45.160 --> 42:48.280
In this case, it was these people were getting married and they wanted their family to be

42:48.280 --> 42:50.220
able to watch from the East Coast.

42:50.220 --> 42:55.760
And so we said, we can do all that in a much more cost-effective way, and we will increase

42:55.760 --> 42:57.880
your ability to grow and expand.

42:57.880 --> 43:02.880
And that resonated with them because then they saw and they said, oh, we could spend

43:02.880 --> 43:05.940
less money and we could get more, and that's something that any business owner is going

43:05.940 --> 43:06.940
to understand.

43:06.940 --> 43:11.920
And you have to remember, for the most part, businesses are actually easier to switch than

43:11.920 --> 43:13.200
people are to Linux.

43:13.200 --> 43:14.200
They really are.

43:14.200 --> 43:19.000
And the reason is because businesses have a common denominator, and that is their bottom

43:19.000 --> 43:20.000
line.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.880
At the end of the day, they just want to make money.

43:21.880 --> 43:26.920
I have yet to meet a CEO, I have yet to meet a president, I have yet to meet a general

43:26.920 --> 43:30.520
manager that really cares what software is running on his computer.

43:30.520 --> 43:35.560
What he does care about is that that stupid thing stays running 24-7, that those employees

43:35.560 --> 43:39.880
know how to use that computer system, that somebody is going to be available to him when

43:39.880 --> 43:46.320
something goes down and get it right back up, and that that machine is going to function

43:46.320 --> 43:47.320
in their environment.

43:47.320 --> 43:52.480
And if it meets those four or five criteria, I have yet to meet a business owner or a business

43:52.480 --> 43:56.120
manager that really cares one way or the other.

43:56.120 --> 43:59.440
And so, we actually just got done doing some kiosks, actually, and this might be a Runs

43:59.440 --> 44:07.120
Linux this coming week, for an amusement park that needs to sign these liability waivers.

44:07.120 --> 44:11.320
It was an easy sell for Linux because the cost of buying an actual computer with a Windows

44:11.320 --> 44:15.960
license and site kiosk on top of that was going to be $700, $800, and to be able to

44:15.960 --> 44:21.600
do that with Ubuntu Mate, a Firefox in kiosk mode, and Intel Nux was a tenth of the price.

44:21.600 --> 44:26.400
So my suggestion is, and I thank you very much for the call, my suggestion is look at

44:26.400 --> 44:31.980
what the business is going to benefit from, what things, if you were that business owner,

44:31.980 --> 44:34.580
the whole moccasin thing works really well here.

44:34.580 --> 44:38.200
Take a look at if you were in their moccasins, if you ran that business, what would make

44:38.200 --> 44:41.720
you want to switch to Linux, and is Linux appropriate for those people?

44:41.720 --> 44:45.440
Because sometimes, you might run into a place where you say, listen, they're an all-Windows

44:45.440 --> 44:52.320
shop, Microsoft, for example, people that work on Microsoft Office, if they came to

44:52.320 --> 44:55.640
me as a client and said we wanted to switch to Linux, we want to use Linux, we want to

44:55.640 --> 44:58.940
see what Alterspeed could provide for you, I would tell them we're probably not the technical

44:58.940 --> 45:00.080
solution provider for them.

45:00.080 --> 45:01.640
I'd be honest with them.

45:01.640 --> 45:07.060
If your job is to support or run Microsoft Office, you're probably not going to be very

45:07.060 --> 45:09.960
happy when I set you down with LibreOffice, nor are you going to be very effective to

45:09.960 --> 45:11.400
your clients.

45:11.400 --> 45:17.960
And so, you know, there are just some situations where people are just stuck in, I want to

45:17.960 --> 45:19.840
do XYZ and I'm going to do XYZ.

45:19.840 --> 45:24.320
Now, don't confuse that with Microsoft couldn't run Linux.

45:24.320 --> 45:27.540
It's not that Microsoft couldn't get word processing and spreadsheet calculations and

45:27.540 --> 45:28.800
PowerPoints done in Linux.

45:28.800 --> 45:29.800
They absolutely could.

45:29.800 --> 45:31.640
They just choose not to do that.

45:31.640 --> 45:35.560
And they make choices that make it necessary for them to run Windows.

45:35.560 --> 45:39.820
But I've yet to ever meet a business that if they wanted to run Linux, that it wouldn't

45:39.820 --> 45:41.880
save them money or save them resources.

45:41.880 --> 45:45.960
Now, somebody I haven't talked to in a while, this name popped up and this is really cool.

45:45.960 --> 45:46.960
Elijah from Idaho.

45:46.960 --> 45:47.960
Hey, Elijah.

45:47.960 --> 45:48.960
How are you?

45:48.960 --> 45:49.960
Hey, no, I'm doing pretty good.

45:49.960 --> 45:50.960
How about you?

45:50.960 --> 45:51.960
I'm doing excellent.

45:51.960 --> 45:52.960
Thanks a lot for calling in today.

45:52.960 --> 45:53.960
How can we help?

45:53.960 --> 45:54.960
Awesome.

45:54.960 --> 46:01.280
Okay, so I've got a couple questions and they're really similar to each other.

46:01.280 --> 46:07.000
On my home network, right now we're just running a super cheap $20 Linksys router that I want

46:07.000 --> 46:08.000
to replace.

46:08.000 --> 46:15.760
Now, I'm wondering, would there be any real difference between putting in a PF Sense based

46:15.760 --> 46:20.000
router or one of those Ubiquiti Aero S routers?

46:20.000 --> 46:24.560
Is there any real difference between like the firewall and that kind of stuff?

46:24.560 --> 46:28.320
So they're targeted at kind of different markets.

46:28.320 --> 46:34.940
PF Sense is a really great solution if you have a very large enterprise and you need

46:34.940 --> 46:42.280
a very large, powerful level or layer three device, edge device that's going to do something

46:42.280 --> 46:43.280
for you.

46:43.280 --> 46:45.840
In those cases, PF Sense make a lot of sense.

46:45.840 --> 46:47.480
I have a couple of concerns with PF Sense.

46:47.480 --> 46:53.800
The first is I try to stay away from computers when I can, as weird as that sounds.

46:53.800 --> 46:58.860
But traditional x86 computers that aren't appliances, like actual computers that are

46:58.860 --> 47:04.480
just being purposed for something, even if it's by a company, I've never had an appliance

47:04.480 --> 47:05.480
like device fail.

47:05.480 --> 47:08.600
I've never had a router fail, never had an access point fail.

47:08.600 --> 47:14.080
I'm sure they do, but at the scale that we work at, I've just never seen it.

47:14.080 --> 47:17.680
I have, however, had servers fail all the time, especially if those servers have spinning

47:17.680 --> 47:18.680
disks in them.

47:18.680 --> 47:19.680
I've seen them fail a lot.

47:19.680 --> 47:21.160
In fact, you basically count on it.

47:21.160 --> 47:23.400
We actually swap all of our spinning disks.

47:23.400 --> 47:29.560
And so the idea that I would take my entire network and base it on a single device that

47:29.560 --> 47:33.280
I know is, especially if it has a spinning disk, I know is going to go out in a couple

47:33.280 --> 47:38.640
of years, that has always made me very nervous.

47:38.640 --> 47:42.760
The second thing is that you can't buy a PF Sense for more than a handful of manufacturers.

47:42.760 --> 47:46.000
So a lot of people just end up building them themselves.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.160
That's not a bad way to go.

47:47.160 --> 47:50.480
And I have a file server that I built myself and put FreeNAS on, so I suppose in that regard

47:50.480 --> 47:51.480
it's kind of the same thing.

47:51.480 --> 47:55.520
But you have to remember, when your edge device goes down, you have taken a lot of stuff out.

47:55.520 --> 47:56.880
So then that brings us to Ubiquiti.

47:56.880 --> 48:00.680
Now, Ubiquiti makes great stuff, and we have a ton of Ubiquiti stuff, and I love Ubiquiti.

48:00.680 --> 48:02.720
I can't say enough good things about Ubiquiti.

48:02.720 --> 48:04.160
It's amazing.

48:04.160 --> 48:13.360
All that said, the things that I like about Ubiquiti are that they are heavily centrally

48:13.360 --> 48:19.200
managed and controlled, which when you're managing a lot of sites is very, very helpful.

48:19.200 --> 48:25.160
When I think about my edge device, I mean, everything that passes through my network

48:25.160 --> 48:29.380
is eventually, if it's leaving, the network is going through that edge device.

48:29.380 --> 48:36.120
And so I become very, very picky at what device I'm going to essentially trust to keep my

48:36.120 --> 48:42.680
network safe from outside intrusions and allow any of my personal traffic, encrypted or otherwise,

48:42.680 --> 48:43.680
to leave through it.

48:43.680 --> 48:48.120
And so a device that is centrally managed and a device that goes up to this controller

48:48.120 --> 48:50.080
and stuff, that has always made me a little bit nervous.

48:50.080 --> 48:56.680
Now, I understand that the newer versions of the edge routers, they can function completely

48:56.680 --> 48:57.680
autonomously.

48:57.680 --> 49:01.480
I can play with one, I think, itself.

49:01.480 --> 49:05.160
And it's just a little web interface and you can control it and do everything that way.

49:05.160 --> 49:07.480
And so it's definitely not a bad way to go.

49:07.480 --> 49:12.320
Personally, I have invested so much time and effort into Microtech that I have a hard time

49:12.320 --> 49:14.480
dragging myself away from those.

49:14.480 --> 49:19.800
You can get RouterOS as a standalone distro and play with it and learn it.

49:19.800 --> 49:25.440
And then you can go buy a $35 router that has all of the features that the enterprise

49:25.440 --> 49:28.160
grade ones do, and then some.

49:28.160 --> 49:31.000
And then when you decide you need to move up and you've learned that interface and you've

49:31.000 --> 49:33.840
learned the web interface or you've learned the command line interface or however it is

49:33.840 --> 49:35.780
you want to manage it and you want to move up from that.

49:35.780 --> 49:41.060
Now you can go buy a $10,000 Microtech or whatever the largest one is, as a 4U monster,

49:41.060 --> 49:44.840
and that is more like a computer thing, and you can go put that in some large business.

49:44.840 --> 49:45.840
But guess what?

49:45.840 --> 49:49.500
You're still using the same web interface that you used on the $35 one, the same web

49:49.500 --> 49:54.660
interface, the same CLI interface that you used on the distro that you just loaded into

49:54.660 --> 49:55.920
VirtualBox.

49:55.920 --> 49:57.280
And that is very compelling to me.

49:57.280 --> 50:00.360
I don't know if either of those, I don't know if I made a very good case for it or not,

50:00.360 --> 50:03.340
but does that kind of answer your question or does that give you some insight or some

50:03.340 --> 50:04.340
things to think about?

50:04.340 --> 50:05.340
It does.

50:05.340 --> 50:06.340
It does.

50:06.340 --> 50:07.340
That's great.

50:07.340 --> 50:08.340
Thank you.

50:08.340 --> 50:12.720
And one other real question that's pretty similar is a local business hired me on as

50:12.720 --> 50:20.320
their tech guy, and it's a local small business and they need to make sure that their network

50:20.320 --> 50:22.420
for that business is secure.

50:22.420 --> 50:27.980
And along with that, the guy wants to become PCI, I think it is, or PCI compliant.

50:27.980 --> 50:32.320
And so would a microchip router that you're talking about, would that do that for them?

50:32.320 --> 50:33.320
It would.

50:33.320 --> 50:37.120
Basically what they're looking for when they talk about PCI compliance is you essentially

50:37.120 --> 50:38.500
want to have two networks.

50:38.500 --> 50:44.620
You want to have a public network that is giving Wi-Fi to people or whatever it is,

50:44.620 --> 50:48.240
and then you need an admin network that is just for the business.

50:48.240 --> 50:50.760
So we run into PCI compliance issues all the time at hotels.

50:50.760 --> 50:54.700
They have a single network and then they just let their guests go on their Wi-Fi network.

50:54.700 --> 50:56.460
You can't do it that way.

50:56.460 --> 50:59.220
Now there's a couple different schools of thought.

50:59.220 --> 51:02.060
I personally totally separate the networks.

51:02.060 --> 51:04.020
I come in at the CABA modem.

51:04.020 --> 51:07.260
I go into what I call a WAN switch, and so I just plug the CABA modem straight into a

51:07.260 --> 51:08.260
WAN switch.

51:08.260 --> 51:11.440
I take two feeds out of that and I go to two entirely separate edge devices.

51:11.440 --> 51:12.440
I have two microtechs.

51:12.440 --> 51:15.520
I have an admin microtech and I have a guest microtech.

51:15.520 --> 51:20.240
And then from there, those networks are entirely different, are configured entirely differently.

51:20.240 --> 51:26.340
And the thing is, the guest network sits physically outside of the firewall.

51:26.340 --> 51:30.340
So there is no, oops, I had them on separate VLANs, but I accidentally tagged this port

51:30.340 --> 51:31.780
and now they're joined together.

51:31.780 --> 51:36.460
There is no, oops, I had a firewall rule separating these two networks, but I accidentally disabled

51:36.460 --> 51:38.460
it or deleted it because I was troubleshooting.

51:38.460 --> 51:44.300
No, they're two physically separate devices that sit physically apart from one another.

51:44.300 --> 51:48.020
And then the downside is, of course, one is they are paying for two routers.

51:48.020 --> 51:51.700
And the second disadvantage, of course, is that we're managing two devices.

51:51.700 --> 51:55.360
But in the long run, I think that's a way better way to go.

51:55.360 --> 51:59.860
The only downside to doing it that way, or the only problem with doing it that way that

51:59.860 --> 52:03.720
I've run into is every once in a while you run into an ISP that won't assign you more

52:03.720 --> 52:06.140
than one dynamically generated address.

52:06.140 --> 52:09.060
And so then they have to pay for statics.

52:09.060 --> 52:11.540
Typically that's not the end of the world because if you're doing anything remote, you're

52:11.540 --> 52:15.060
going to want static assigned addresses to those edge devices anyway, because if you

52:15.060 --> 52:18.700
ever need to make a change to them, it's really nice, especially in your case where you live

52:18.700 --> 52:23.060
out in the boonies and you're commuting into work, very, very nice to be able to just SSH

52:23.060 --> 52:28.060
into those things and restart them or make changes to them versus having to actually

52:28.060 --> 52:29.460
drive out there.

52:29.460 --> 52:34.460
But most of the ISPs that I've worked with, if you just put in a switch to the cable modem

52:34.460 --> 52:40.340
and it will split out those two connections and give you a dedicated guest side and a

52:40.340 --> 52:41.980
dedicated admin side.

52:41.980 --> 52:42.980
Hey, great question.

52:42.980 --> 52:44.100
Thanks a lot for calling in.

52:44.100 --> 52:52.060
A couple minutes left in the show if you want to call in 1-877-347-0011.

52:52.060 --> 52:53.060
That's the number to call.

52:53.060 --> 52:58.380
And we're talking about Linux and technology and of course, personal life and business.

52:58.380 --> 53:03.020
Now, hey, Ashley from Ottawa, Canada is joining us.

53:03.020 --> 53:04.580
Hi, Ashley, how are you?

53:04.580 --> 53:05.580
Not too bad.

53:05.580 --> 53:07.340
Hey, Nolan, long time listener, first time caller.

53:07.340 --> 53:08.340
All right.

53:08.340 --> 53:09.340
How can we help today?

53:09.340 --> 53:14.780
I'm not sure if it's Linux Unplugged or Linux Action Show.

53:14.780 --> 53:20.060
You guys mentioned that if you know most of what, not obviously as much as you or your

53:20.060 --> 53:23.140
co-worker know, but if you know most of what you guys are talking about, they should be

53:23.140 --> 53:26.020
working with Linux.

53:26.020 --> 53:33.660
I just got accepted to college for CompTIA certification and stuff like that.

53:33.660 --> 53:38.900
They're trying to push Windows and I really just want to work with Linux.

53:38.900 --> 53:45.020
Do you suggest just going to Linux Academy or getting in material and stuff like that

53:45.020 --> 53:50.780
and studying for your certs as a way of getting into Linux itself, like the industry?

53:50.780 --> 53:51.780
Sure.

53:51.780 --> 53:56.340
I think that anytime you look at spending any kind of money, especially something like

53:56.340 --> 53:59.660
college, you have to look at it as an investment.

53:59.660 --> 54:03.480
What you look at anytime we do an investment is we want to look at the return on our investment.

54:03.480 --> 54:08.880
If I buy a laptop for my business, if AltaSpeed writes a check for my laptop, we look at the

54:08.880 --> 54:10.780
return on investment for that laptop.

54:10.780 --> 54:16.120
If we spend $1,000 on that laptop, will it fundamentally enable me to make more money

54:16.120 --> 54:19.340
than it costs thus by returning on its investment?

54:19.340 --> 54:21.060
The answer unequivocally is yes.

54:21.060 --> 54:24.940
The more places I can get work done, the more efficient I am, the more money this place

54:24.940 --> 54:25.940
makes.

54:25.940 --> 54:29.980
That's just the way it works.

54:29.980 --> 54:32.460
We want to look at the return on investment.

54:32.460 --> 54:36.220
If you look at college as a return on investment, you say, how much money am I spending?

54:36.220 --> 54:37.220
I'm spending $30,000.

54:37.220 --> 54:39.140
I'm spending $50,000.

54:39.140 --> 54:40.580
What am I getting for that $50,000?

54:40.580 --> 54:42.500
Well, a couple of things.

54:42.500 --> 54:49.300
If you want to work in large corporate environments, a lot of those places, you want to get your

54:49.300 --> 54:51.700
foot through the door if you don't have a degree.

54:51.700 --> 54:56.540
They'll just ask you, they'll say, what's your after high school experience?

54:56.540 --> 54:59.940
If you don't have something to put on those lines, they don't even look at your resume.

54:59.940 --> 55:04.940
The second thing we can get from college though is real skills that are applicable in the

55:04.940 --> 55:10.680
workplace that will fundamentally make you better at what you do.

55:10.680 --> 55:11.680
I have a degree.

55:11.680 --> 55:12.680
I went to school.

55:12.680 --> 55:17.220
I learned things in school, both on the business side that let me sit down and look at our

55:17.220 --> 55:20.940
books and I can instantly get a picture of what my company is doing, as well as on the

55:20.940 --> 55:26.620
technical side, I learned networking things and subnetting and stuff like that.

55:26.620 --> 55:30.460
When I went into the industry, I could walk in and I already had an understanding of how

55:30.460 --> 55:32.820
some of those things work.

55:32.820 --> 55:35.580
Is that saying that you have to go to college to work in IT?

55:35.580 --> 55:37.380
No, no, it is not saying that at all.

55:37.380 --> 55:44.880
In fact, arguably more people are hired and the preference in this industry is on certifications

55:44.880 --> 55:48.820
and being current because one of the big things that I see that drives people out of the industry

55:48.820 --> 55:53.620
or that doesn't get them hired is people will walk into a job interview, but they'll walk

55:53.620 --> 55:57.500
into a place that they want to work at and they'll sit down there at their, their, their

55:57.500 --> 56:00.340
resume and they'll say, yeah, I learned Red Hat five.

56:00.340 --> 56:01.460
Okay, great.

56:01.460 --> 56:04.300
So we're using Red Hat seven soon to be eight.

56:04.300 --> 56:05.300
What do you know about Red Hat eight?

56:05.300 --> 56:08.980
Well, I don't know anything about Red Hat eight, but I know Red Hat five that's useless.

56:08.980 --> 56:10.900
That's useless to me as me as an employer.

56:10.900 --> 56:11.900
That's a useless thing to me.

56:11.900 --> 56:16.800
I would much rather have somebody sit down at my desk and say, listen, I don't have any

56:16.800 --> 56:18.180
formal education.

56:18.180 --> 56:25.660
What I do have is a passion to learn and I have gone to Linux Academy and I have studied

56:25.660 --> 56:29.980
the material that's there and I am very comfortable in making things happen.

56:29.980 --> 56:35.660
I am very comfortable in achieving the goals that Linux Academy has set up and if you give

56:35.660 --> 56:39.020
me a production environment, I can go out there and I can do the kind of work that you

56:39.020 --> 56:42.020
need me to do and you let me work for a couple of weeks free and I'll show you, I can make

56:42.020 --> 56:43.020
you more money than I cost.

56:43.020 --> 56:44.660
I'll hire that guy in a heartbeat.

56:44.660 --> 56:47.100
In a heartbeat I'd hire that guy.

56:47.100 --> 56:49.220
I can't speak so much for Canada.

56:49.220 --> 56:53.600
I would assume it's similar to the US, but in the US most people are not working for

56:53.600 --> 56:54.960
large corporate firms.

56:54.960 --> 56:59.380
Most people are working for small business and small business cares way more about can

56:59.380 --> 57:04.060
you get the job done than they do about what your formal education is.

57:04.060 --> 57:07.380
So what I would encourage you to do is I would sit down with a guidance counselor at the

57:07.380 --> 57:12.780
school or I would look through some of that material or the courseware and I would say,

57:12.780 --> 57:16.300
is any of this material valuable to me in the workplace and is it something that I can't

57:16.300 --> 57:20.620
get other ways and if the answer to that question is yes and if the answer to that question

57:20.620 --> 57:26.460
is I need to know Cisco networking so that I can go get this job making $70,000 a year

57:26.460 --> 57:32.220
and so if I spend $30,000 I can make $70,000, well that would be a good return on investment.

57:32.220 --> 57:37.480
If you go to college and you say I want to go learn about Linux server administration

57:37.480 --> 57:41.740
or maybe you go and learn about Windows system administration because that's where the next

57:41.740 --> 57:45.420
job is and that's how you put food on the table while you work towards the goal.

57:45.420 --> 57:48.580
Taking a step back so that you can take a step forward in the future, that's an okay

57:48.580 --> 57:49.580
way to go too.

57:49.580 --> 57:57.220
Is that something like because you're a huge Linux enthusiast and I'm the same way but

57:57.220 --> 58:02.580
would you suggest doing that like actually taking the time to learn the Microsoft stuff

58:02.580 --> 58:06.100
just to put food on the table until you can get into Linux industry?

58:06.100 --> 58:13.660
No I guess I wouldn't suggest, I mean I'll say this, I will do whatever it takes to feed

58:13.660 --> 58:17.400
my family before I let them starve so if I mean I'll work at McDonald's before I let

58:17.400 --> 58:18.400
my family starve.

58:18.400 --> 58:23.460
Whatever, that said I think that the paradigm that you have to either work for a company

58:23.460 --> 58:28.020
that uses Windows or use Microsoft products or you won't have a job, I think that's a

58:28.020 --> 58:32.060
false paradigm because so many people are hiring Linux people right now.

58:32.060 --> 58:37.240
In fact we have people from Linux Academy that are coming and saying we want to hire

58:37.240 --> 58:43.980
people from your audience because your audience is smart and talented and we have other employers.

58:43.980 --> 58:47.980
There was a guy just wrote in I think three weeks ago, four weeks ago he wrote into the

58:47.980 --> 58:52.480
Linux action show and he said I am looking to hire some Linux guys and we're dry.

58:52.480 --> 58:56.060
We cannot find Linux guys so can you give me some contact information for some Linux

58:56.060 --> 58:59.580
guys and so I made a plug in here and people that wrote in their resumes I forwarded off

58:59.580 --> 59:00.580
to him.

59:00.580 --> 59:01.580
I remember that show yeah.

59:01.580 --> 59:05.200
Yeah so I mean there are very much people looking to hire Linux guys and they're so

59:05.200 --> 59:08.260
desperate to hire Linux guys they'll even hire them remotely.

59:08.260 --> 59:11.680
They don't even care if you move they just want Linux guys so I think you can easily

59:11.680 --> 59:18.280
make $70,000, $80,000, $90,000 a year working in a Linux career but I guess what I was saying

59:18.280 --> 59:23.660
was if you have to take a step back, if you take one step back so that you can take a

59:23.660 --> 59:27.020
step forward that's an okay thing to do.

59:27.020 --> 59:29.300
You just want to make sure that you're moving in a direction that you're comfortable with

59:29.300 --> 59:32.380
because if you're like me and you don't want to be working on Windows for the rest of your

59:32.380 --> 59:37.980
life and I started working on Linux, I started working on Windows in a help desk and it about

59:37.980 --> 59:42.060
drove me crazy and you don't want to be that guy.

59:42.060 --> 59:46.540
You don't want to be myself 10 years because you about want to kill yourself.

59:46.540 --> 59:48.620
So yeah but does that answer your question?

59:48.620 --> 59:52.340
Yeah it does and yeah you guys are like rock stars to me so keep up the good work.

59:52.340 --> 59:53.340
Awesome.

59:53.340 --> 59:54.340
I enjoy listening to your show.

59:54.340 --> 59:57.620
Well thanks we really appreciate having you and thank you very much for the call.

59:57.620 --> 01:00:06.220
Just a couple minutes left if you want to get in 1-877-347-0011 let's see here who

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:07.220
do we have here.

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:11.660
I'll tell you let's just stop here and talk about Linux Academy right.

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:22.500
Linux Academy is interesting in 2016 that I would get that call.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:26.460
I would get the call where somebody is talking and I have to think about it to give them

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:31.540
an answer mind you where I'm asking do you want to spend $15 a month or do you want to

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:34.740
spend $30,000 a year?

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:39.620
And if you spend the $15 a month in about 6 months you have a reasonable chance of obtaining

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:43.900
the same skill set as somebody who spends $30,000 and goes to a liberal arts education

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:44.900
system.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:48.280
Of course you're not going to be liberally arts educated you're not going to take basket

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:55.460
weaving and music therapy and whatever other classes you got to take to actually get a

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:59.180
whatever else you have to take to get you know the degree but you're going to learn

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:02.820
the same skills and those skills are valuable in the marketplace.

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:07.980
And it gets even cheaper if you are a Linux unplugged listener because we have a code.

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:15.100
If you go to Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged they're going to knock a couple bucks off.

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:20.320
And I have done all of my education in the last two years strictly through Linux Academy

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:25.940
and I'm comparing that to doing actual like Red Hat classes.

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:28.420
I've done both and I know which one I like better.

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:34.740
I like being able to sit in my skippies at night drinking a Coke watching the Linux action

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:41.380
show but that's a self-serving I don't watch myself but watching TechSnap and doing

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:45.860
Linux Academy on my computer in their you know bite-sized pieces.

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:49.780
It's a really valuable way to get an education and I said it on last and somebody was bringing

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.860
it up here.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:55.500
You don't have an excuse not to have a good Linux job.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:59.100
You don't have an excuse not to be doing what you love.

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:03.540
That's an old quote right you do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life.

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:06.580
Honestly I swear to God I don't feel like I work guys.

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:08.220
I don't feel like I work at all.

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:13.400
I feel like I wake up every morning and I get to go out and play with Linux all day

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:17.820
every day and part of that is because I have the skill set to do it and part of having

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:22.260
the skill set is going to Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:26.900
And while we're talking about advertisers I'll just tell you something.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:33.060
It makes me so irritated and sick when I see people that complain about advertisers.

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:38.420
I was listening to a radio show I recently got back into Sirius XM and I'm really following

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:45.080
the political election and in this election or in this show this guy is talking and he

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:51.820
makes this beautiful point about the Constitution this absolutely stellar pinpoint perfect point

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:57.340
about how we need to we need to get to a point where we all agree on the rules to which we're

01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:02.100
going to govern society and it just is a beautiful point I just I was so interested in the show

01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:06.320
and I was so interested I'm like that's a great point and then he goes have you upgraded

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:12.500
your underwear lately and I went say what you know I did one of those one of those you

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:17.780
know German Shepherd cockeyed you know the tilt the head thing what and I'm like what

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:21.780
what did he just say underwear have you upgraded your underwear lately let me tell you about

01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:27.780
underwear blah blah blah and then he goes into this ad and all I could think about was

01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:34.520
my god that man just took X amount of dollars and then talked about underwear on his political

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:40.300
show because somebody paid him to do it that is such a weird thing and it is so jarring

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:45.300
and weird that I don't even want to listen to the rest of the program because he's talking

01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:49.140
about underwear and it has nothing to do with the program and frankly I don't really want

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:52.420
underwear advice from a guy I'm listening politics which just doesn't make any sense

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:58.500
right if you guys could see I mean you know how valuable Chris's hair is and he pulls

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:03.320
half of it out stressing over which advertisers is he going to take on the network he is he

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:08.740
is anal retentive when it comes to who he will allow to advertise on the network and

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:15.960
it is it is so the process the way that Jupiter broadcasting is does advertisers is so much

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:21.580
different from every other show I have listened to it is unbelievable it is absolutely truly

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:26.340
unbelievable and the way that it works is he goes and finds products and services that

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:31.140
serve him well and that he's been using for years and have provided him great value and

01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:36.300
then he goes and says you know be really great if I could go tell the audience that wants

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:41.340
to hear my opinion on technology because let's face it the man is pretty well versed in technology

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:45.940
he spends every waking minute researching reading or trying technology says I'm gonna

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:50.700
go share those opinions with people and because he's not an idiot he capitalizes the heck

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:55.320
out of it because you would do that right if you have an educated formed opinion that

01:04:55.320 --> 01:05:00.280
is a positive you know reflection of a business and you're going to go give that that opinion

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:04.980
on air you might as well get paid for it you just that's just that is a that is a basic

01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:09.420
fundamental function of business is when you're good at something you don't do it for free

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:14.340
and the fact that people find a way to complain about that is unfreaking believable to me

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:18.260
it is unfreaking believable that people have the audacity to complain about it what's

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:22.180
further unbelievable is that the same people that complain about the ad reads are not the

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:27.380
people that are on the patreon contributing to patreon if you want to not hear ad reads

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:31.860
on the shows then the patreon should be like double or triple of what it is because this

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:36.960
network has to be funded somehow and right now those advertisers are funding that network

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:41.060
and by the way those advertisers are providing an extraordinarily valuable service that you're

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:46.860
lucky to know about I was before I got on this before I walked up those stairs down

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:50.660
this hallway and sat down in this chair to do this show today I was in the middle of

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:55.500
troubleshooting when I've had the worst week of my life this week as far as all to speed

01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:00.220
troubleshooting goes because we've had a ton of like nitty-gritty problems that I had that

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:06.020
require my attention and I don't like to do that I like to I like to be the the you know

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:09.220
the manager I like to sit and have the text go out and do the work and then I just kind

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:12.140
of check things off make sure that things are going smoothly occasionally I poke my

01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:16.520
head in something that I find fun this week it hit we've been so busy I've had to devote

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:21.860
my energy to fixing dumb little problems that I don't want to be fixing and just before

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:25.980
I got up these stairs and sat down to do this program I had just finished setting up a new

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:32.100
phone server for someone and I didn't have time I didn't have time to go provision an

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:38.220
actual box and set it up coordinate all that stuff and so I took a snapshot of a of a stock

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:43.100
phone system that I have set up with generic extensions and I used their imaging thing

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:49.820
to create a droplet from that image and I had a phone system up and running from start

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:55.100
to finish with the trunks configured the whole nine yards in like 30 minutes I mean it was

01:06:55.100 --> 01:07:00.720
absolutely unbelievable and using the code do unplugged you're going to get ten dollars

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:04.300
off your Linux rig so in this case is a five dollar rig I'm gonna get two months of that

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:09.100
file server for free or I'm sorry phone server for free I won't even pay for it the fact

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:13.620
that I'm telling that the fact that we have to explain why this is valuable to you that

01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:18.900
you can I'm charging that client by the way seventy five dollars an hour and we build

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:24.660
based on a templated thing so if it to set up a phone system from scratch I don't know

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:28.900
what exactly it comes out to be but whatever that is whatever that time thing is that's

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:33.180
what we build the client and then when we go back if I can find a way to shorthand that

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:38.060
and shorten that up a little bit guess what maximizes my profit maximizes my spread and

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:42.400
I make more money doing that I'm doing and all of those innovations are happening because

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:45.700
of digital ocean not because of anything I'm doing it's because of what they're doing

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:53.700
and I'm able to resell absolutely incredible just absolutely unbelievable so there there's

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:58.620
my rant for for advertising I'll tell you something else too but just before I'm done

01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:04.180
I'm almost done but before I'm done my phone I am leaving for I'm leaving for a for an

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:08.620
international trip I'm gonna take my ting sim out I'm gonna put go buy an international

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:12.980
sim I'm gonna put it in my phone and then I'm gonna have phone service wherever I am

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:17.380
because that's going to be because I because ting doesn't charge you for what you don't

01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:26.780
use and so you can go to you the the ability to just pay for what you're using the ability

01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:33.740
to own your own device is unbelievable and it's the same appeal as Linux it's the same

01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:37.020
appeal as being able to own my own computer and doing what I want with it now I've extended

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:44.980
that to my phone I just I it is it just it makes my brain hurt to think about like why

01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:49.180
this is controversial why we have to explain this to people why that's not like painfully

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:54.200
obvious that this is like an amazing thing but if you think if you're one of the people

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:58.380
out there that say oh they just do those ad reads because they they pay the network you

01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:03.980
are a hundred percent wrong it has that that is that is a very small fraction of what contributes

01:09:03.980 --> 01:09:07.740
the it's the complete other way around we serve people by providing them with valuable

01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:12.260
information and we happen to find a way to capitalize on that and I'm not done yet I'm

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:16.980
almost done but not quite done yet one last thing the other day I was driving out to my

01:09:16.980 --> 01:09:24.180
buddy's house and I were having a conversation about phones and he's talking about how he

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:31.320
bought this phone on on his whatever network and now he wanted to get a different phone

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:34.460
but he wasn't sure if he wanted to stick with the same service provider and he's like well

01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:37.020
I'm trying to decide what service provider so I can decide what phone to get and I'm

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:39.620
like that doesn't make any sense dude just buy the phone you want and then put it on

01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:44.180
whatever service provider you want you know I'm used to ting he says no I can't do that

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.260
this one only activates here this one only activates there and I'm like listen dude here's

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:52.660
what you do you go to eBay and we bought him a Nexus 5 and he got it for like $85 and he

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:59.060
activated that sucker on ting now what I do is I actually keep ting sim cards on me at

01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:02.940
all times so I can give them out to people so I end up ting sim card we activate it and

01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:07.940
he went over to linux.ting.com and that got him the promo code he was able to activate

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:13.060
his phone on the ting network now the great thing about that is because I know that he's

01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:17.500
going to end up sticking with ting because the fastest way to decide to stay with ting

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:21.740
is to go try somebody else and then you realize how much more you pay or how crappy the service

01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:25.940
is and then you come back so I if he wants to leave though he's not locked into ting

01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:31.300
he can go over to AT&T or he can go to T-Mobile or he can go to you know name a GSM provider

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:35.940
you can go to those those places and then when he either gets sick of paying $190 a

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:39.380
month for his phone service or he doesn't have reception anywhere then he'll decide

01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:46.820
to come back to ting so linux.ting.com you'll save a couple bucks and you will own your

01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:51.580
device you will own your service you'll only use for what you pay you go on a trip out

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:55.380
of the country you don't use your phone for a couple of days then you don't pay for

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:59.980
those couple of days only pay for what you use linux.ting.com that's all I have to

01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:05.140
say about that okay Zachy was on hold but you got you got dropped there and you have

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:12.960
a question about setting up your wireless yes so I'm about to purchase a Toyota motor

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:19.380
home that I'm gonna strip out and redo and I want to make it smart I travel up and down

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:27.980
the coast from Oregon down to Arizona and what I want to do is make it so I can park

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:34.500
like you know like in a Walmart or wherever and hook up to their wireless network but

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:41.060
not have to hook my devices up directly have my own like separate wireless internet inside

01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:47.420
the vehicle okay the audio cut out of the last can you give me that last little bit

01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:55.860
again okay what I want to do is set up a wireless basically have Wi-Fi boosters on the outside

01:11:55.860 --> 01:12:01.100
of the mobile home gotcha so that way I can have my own network on the inside and don't

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:06.540
have to hook my devices directly up to their system or go into the building it gotcha there's

01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:10.140
a great device for doing something like that called the cradle point and basically what

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:15.260
the cradle point is is it is a hardware device that connects to a wireless network and then

01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:20.740
has its own router built in and then its own access point built in and so basically you

01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:25.260
can connect it via hardline or via Wi-Fi to any network you want and all of your devices

01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:29.780
connect to it and then it becomes your router and edge device and all that stuff and then

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:34.820
your connection to the internet it can be either wireless or wired it connected whatever

01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:38.780
you want so if you're you know you're mooching off the neighbors that would work Chris for

01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:42.500
example uses the cradle point in his RV so when he travels from RV park to RV park he

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:46.460
connects the cradle point then to whatever the wireless system is there or if he's parked

01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:52.820
at JB then he plugs in but all of his devices inside just talk to that cradle point would

01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:59.020
that ends would that would that help you yeah that would help me quite a bit and I just

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:05.420
want to let you know thanks for all you guys do I ended up finding a computer in the dump

01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:12.180
and I switched it over to Linux that was like my first step I had an expired Windows card

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:17.620
and then I went and purchased a couple elite books and they're running Linux mint beautifully

01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:22.660
so I just want to thank you for all that you do and keep up the good work cool well we

01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:27.940
really thank you for the call and I appreciate having you it it is a lot of fun I can honestly

01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:35.100
say this might be one of the most fun things I have ever done on on the network is doing

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:40.220
these calls hanging out I love I love answering questions and the thing is people are asking

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:48.860
me for my opinion today and I have to tell you I am an expert on my opinion I I know

01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:52.840
everything there is to know about my own opinion it's it's kind of incredible but but this

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:57.440
has been a lot of fun and I really appreciate you guys taking the time to call in and hopefully

01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:01.140
we were able to provide some meaningful answers to you I'm gonna take a couple more calls

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:08.340
I'm gonna go to is it Goffin from Chicago no Gorin Gorin hi Gorin how can we help hi

01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:13.340
nice to meet you finally over the phone long time listen the first time call I do shoot

01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:19.140
you guys an email every once in a while I hope I'm not bothering you too much no no

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:26.900
I don't have a question so I do run a small I think consulting I support local small businesses

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:33.820
use Linux distros made mainly for phone systems and file servers and stuff so I do wonder

01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:40.740
what can you recommend is like customer database it doesn't have to be fully open source it

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:46.100
doesn't have to be fully free I'm fine with the you know a small monthly charge so I can

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:51.460
keep track of all my customers and then all the hardware that I have installed at their

01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:56.100
network a lot of credentials for servers for searches access points and stuff like that

01:14:56.100 --> 01:15:03.540
sure so what you're looking for is is what's known as a CRM or customer relation management

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:13.380
CRM and there's a couple of them out there there's there's also ERPs that are out there

01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:19.500
I actually am just it's funny you asked this it really is because I actually was just taking

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:27.180
some time to investigate this for myself basically we have we have breached the end of what I

01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:33.980
think we can reliably provide for our for a meaningfully provide for our customers I

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:38.100
think we are serving them as as good as we can possibly serve them they don't have a

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:42.620
need that goes unmet there we have a we have a 120 minute response time and so things are

01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:46.500
going great and so my next thing is now I want to help more people I want to expand

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:52.060
out I want to do more remote management I want to I want to do Wi-Fi more hotels and

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:57.580
part of that is going to involve provisioning if you will a sales team I need people that

01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:02.420
will go out and sell these products in addition to me because I need to spend my time working

01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:05.900
on the actual business and so I need people to continue sales and continue to move the

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:09.500
business forward but I also need to because I'm a control freak whatever you want to

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:13.140
call it I like to keep track of all these things and I like to have a I like to wake

01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:17.460
up and sit down in my office and I like to have an idea of at least an idea of what all

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:20.460
of the people that work for this place are doing because after all my name's on the

01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:25.540
building I want to know and so I have looked for a CRM and basically what I've come down

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:33.500
to is ZURMO it is an it is an open source CRM that is completely web-based so you could

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:37.340
spin this up on something like DigitalOcean and it would cost you practically nothing

01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:43.100
and this will allow you to track your customers track your sales and and so basically what

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:47.280
we are going to use it for is we are going to use it to focus on customers because one

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:50.900
thing you have to you one thing you have to get right there's a difference between serving

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:55.320
somebody and annoying the heck out of them if you if we go into a hotel and they have

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:59.360
crappy Wi-Fi and so they are losing hundreds of dollars a month or thousands of dollars

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:04.100
a month because these days Wi-Fi is just as critical as hot water and we go into that

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:08.440
place and we say for five thousand dollars we will go through and we will increase your

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:11.620
revenue by two thousand dollars a month because you're gonna have that many more guests because

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:17.940
your guests demand Wi-Fi if we can do that that is not bothering somebody that is not

01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:24.980
selling the that is not the that you know the the the the stereotype of selling somebody

01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:28.420
something it is it's serving somebody and we are taking we guess we're gonna get paid

01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:33.900
for our efforts and but we are going to make you more money than than we cost you there's

01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:38.260
a difference between doing that and then just cold calling places and saying hi I'm Noah

01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:41.700
with all the speed and I want you to buy my Wi-Fi you know that that is not a that is

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:45.260
not helping that just annoying somebody and so there are little things you can do for

01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:49.380
example you know you you when you go in and talk to somebody you say well how do I you

01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:52.180
know can we follow up can we follow up in a couple of days can I give you a call if

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:56.700
they say yes then you're that does not bothering somebody's not harassing somebody to call

01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:59.700
them back two days like you said you were going to do and follow up with them and if

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:04.080
they say we're not interested then you know you move on but we need a way to track who

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:08.180
has been called who hasn't been called because sometimes you walk into a place and you say

01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:12.140
I'll do X Y Z and it'll cost you X Y Z and they say yeah that's great and now they're

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:15.580
waiting for you to come in and do the thing that you promised to do and so you need a

01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:19.260
way to track that and so that's kind of what we're doing at the CM does that sound kind

01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:23.980
of similar to what you're looking for yes I was hoping that I see a web-based CRM would

01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:32.180
be the solution I tried some of them and VMs on my VM host at home like the VTiger sugar

01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:38.140
CRM and some others but most of them look like way over complicated for for my basic

01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:43.280
needs at the moment so yeah I haven't came across dermal but I'll be definitely installing

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:47.340
it tonight and I'll check it out sure yeah check out check out Zermal I think you'll

01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:52.220
find that's that's a pretty decent one to go to and it's definitely the one that Alta

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:58.880
speed is going to look at and I will follow up as either an app pick or as maybe a show

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:05.020
episode idea about that later hey if you haven't heard we do this show every week or Chris

01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:13.140
and Wes do the show every week this week they're out on location filming interviews so they're

01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:17.340
not here so that's why I'm filling in and we would like your I would like your opinion

01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:22.780
I would like to know how you thought this show went if you like this segment if you

01:19:22.780 --> 01:19:27.480
want us to do this kind of episode again Chris and I are talking about spinning this off

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:32.500
as its own show it would be a call-in show I assume that I've done an okay job hosting

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:37.820
it and that he would let that continue but that's basically what we're looking forward

01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:42.420
to and we need to know so head over to Jupiter broadcasting comm click on the contact link

01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:47.180
choose Linux unplugged from the drop-down menu and let us know what you think mostly

01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:53.340
just as this is a show this is not going to replace unplugged we I sorely sorely apologize

01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:59.180
to our mobile room for the I was told early on in the episode that basically they can't

01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:03.300
hear what's going on from the from the calls there's no way to tie those in so I need to

01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:09.860
have a bigger mixer to make that happen and but we we very much value your contribution

01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:14.380
and you guys taking time out of your day to be here and the show will return to its regular

that I'm the co-host of the Linux action show that's every Sunday mornings at noon on Sundays

01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:40.540
that's Pacific time a special thank you to Rekai our video editor Michael tunnel our

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:45.420
producer and everyone in Jupiter broadcasting who makes this show and every other show on

01:20:45.420 --> 01:21:15.380
the network possible and we'll see you back here next week.

01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:58.420
All right now that that is over I am let's hear to do I didn't here's the thing if I

01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:01.660
would have seen somebody from Germany anyone that's calling especially from Germany I would

01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:11.240
have taken idea to do here we go Jay hold up let's see what's up Jay Jay from Germany

01:22:11.240 --> 01:22:17.340
do I have you me hi I'm sorry I'm glad you said something in the chat room I the thing

01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:22.740
is it doesn't tell me I have to I it the way that it works it doesn't go in in any specific

01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:26.780
order just kind of goes in the order that people called in and I've got like 15 calls

01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:31.540
in 15 calls that I haven't gotten to but we're like we're literally 40 minutes over what

01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:35.100
the show is and Rekai still has to edit this thing and get it out so I had to wrap it up

01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:38.420
but I will answer your question now that we're now that we're off and I'm done recording

01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:46.220
how can we help okay thanks I just wanted to ask how much pain is it changing from one

01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:54.180
main Linux distro to another so are you locked in like with Microsoft or is it harder or

01:22:54.180 --> 01:23:03.300
less hard because I fear I'm currently locked into the Ubuntu system yes so I you know it's

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:07.060
funny it's it's really interesting you ask that because I have actually just gone through

01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:11.980
that this week I have switched from an Ubuntu based distro over to enter goes and what I

01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:19.620
have found was that it actually isn't that bad most especially when you go from a very

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:23.780
well-supported Linux distro to another very well-supported Linux distro you don't run

01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:27.860
into a lot of pain it you know anything that's available in Ubuntu is pretty much available

01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:31.400
enter goes now where it wouldn't be so smooth is if you went from something like Ubuntu

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:36.500
to Fedora I love Fedora I think Fedora is a great operating system I think Red Hat is

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:41.220
the best Linux company out there and if that's not clear let me say that again I think Red

01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:48.380
Hat is the best Linux company out there but I don't think that they're I don't think that

01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:54.380
they have a desktop offering that that fits exactly what I'm looking for these days and

01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:58.540
that is that a rock-solid desktop operating system that's designed for a business class

01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:05.140
system that I don't have to do anything with for a couple of years but even knowing that

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:08.860
even knowing that how much I love Red Hat the company and I've been a Fedora user since

01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:14.860
version one there are some things that I just never could get to work right in Fedora GNS3

01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:19.740
which is a network simulator when I was doing my networking certification would not run

01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:25.380
in Fedora so I had to run Ubuntu in a virtual box inside of Fedora to run GNS3 yeah I know

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:30.020
it's ridiculous right that might change now but KVM yeah yeah but five years ago six years

01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:34.980
ago that was the case GNS3 would not run Harupad the to the rest of my knowledge it there is

01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:40.060
no precompiled binary for there's no there's no RPM or it's not in any repo you have to

01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:46.020
extract and and you know and run the the actual binary so if you go to an uns you know a less

01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:52.460
supported less used Linux distro you might run into some of that but yeah if you stick

01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:58.780
with main distros I don't think you're gonna have a problem at all so no problem switching

01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:02.740
to arch not at all now I think you're gonna be fine in fact I think you're going I think

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:09.260
you're gonna find that your your experience is a lot smoother on arch so it's just going

01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:17.260
to be a reinstall and copy files or could I do this even in a more or less hot like

01:25:17.260 --> 01:25:26.140
state where I install the new system onto the old one well I don't know that you can

01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:32.260
cop you know if it's just a folder full of binaries it would it'll probably run and if

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:35.180
you copy over something like your home folder you might keep your bookmarks and stuff like

01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:41.220
that in general I would probably expect to have to reinstall your programs and reconfigure

01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:45.560
things I don't know that you're going to be able to quite that seamlessly smooth over

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:48.940
but what I guess what I mean is all your programs are going to be available if you have any

01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:52.420
database files or or personal files you'd be able to back those up and restore them

01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:56.180
without any problem things like your Firefox bookmarks or Chrome bookmarks or something

01:25:56.180 --> 01:26:00.860
like that yeah you could move a home folder over that wouldn't be a problem but yeah I

01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:05.160
don't think you're just going to be it is possible Google actually swapped their Red

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:09.380
Hat servers for Ubuntu without ever even turning them off they literally swap like one file

01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:14.700
at a time yeah yeah and they made a presentation about it and it was wicked cool so it I'm

01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:18.260
not saying it can't be done it is definitely possible it's probably ten times more work

01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:21.920
than it would be just to back your stuff up and reinstall but I don't think you're going

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:34.660
to find that to be overly burdensome.
