WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.620
Well, I found something I'm gonna be staring at

00:01.620 --> 00:02.520
for a little while.

00:02.520 --> 00:06.340
It's a live tracker of Starlink satellites.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.560
Have you seen this, Wes?

00:07.560 --> 00:09.360
Satellite map.space.

00:09.360 --> 00:12.840
Talk about a new distraction I did not need.

00:12.840 --> 00:16.240
And it's not only Starlink, there's OneWeb on here too.

00:16.240 --> 00:17.740
They're just flying all over the place.

00:17.740 --> 00:19.440
They're above us right now.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.680
Like I'm looking at these two here and it,

00:21.680 --> 00:24.360
wait a minute, are they about to, oh no!

00:24.360 --> 00:36.400
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.200
My name is Chris.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.280
My name is Wes.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.040
Hello, Wes.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.640
Brush off all that Starlink debris.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.000
We have a show to do, would you?

00:42.000 --> 00:44.240
This episode is brought to you by the all-new A Cloud Guru,

00:44.240 --> 00:46.440
the leader in learning for the cloud, Linux,

00:46.440 --> 00:47.760
and other modern tech skills.

00:47.760 --> 00:50.320
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs.

00:50.320 --> 00:50.840
Get certified.

00:50.840 --> 00:51.360
Get hired.

00:51.360 --> 00:54.640
Get learning at acloudguru.com.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.560
Well, coming up on the show today,

00:56.560 --> 01:00.600
can you self-host your own shells.com-like alternative?

01:00.600 --> 01:02.760
Obviously, at a different scale, but is it possible

01:02.760 --> 01:05.840
to take a desktop environment and put it in a container

01:05.840 --> 01:07.360
and then access it remotely?

01:07.360 --> 01:09.000
Well, not only is it possible, thanks

01:09.000 --> 01:11.440
to a really cool open source project,

01:11.440 --> 01:13.760
but it really kicks the llama's ass.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.160
In fact, you can do it with just about any modern web browser

01:16.160 --> 01:17.960
and you'll probably be able to get it set up

01:17.960 --> 01:19.320
in about 15 minutes or so.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.520
We'll tell you all about our experiments

01:21.520 --> 01:23.400
with Web Top on the show and how it's

01:23.400 --> 01:26.440
going to solve a major problem during our Jupiter Colony

01:26.440 --> 01:28.560
reunion road trip.

01:28.560 --> 01:32.000
It's going to be like our hero tool, potentially.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.040
That is, if I can get the server up and running

01:34.040 --> 01:35.800
for any continuous moment.

01:35.800 --> 01:39.120
It's been crashing all morning, Wes, and I'm a mess right now.

01:39.120 --> 01:40.400
This is going to be a bad show.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.080
I'm just going to warn you.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.960
Normally, I say it's going to be a great episode.

01:42.960 --> 01:44.040
Got a real big show.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.280
We have a terrible show today.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.920
It's going to be awful because of me.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.880
I'd like to point out that we didn't just do an Arch update.

01:49.880 --> 01:51.000
I'm not to blame.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.680
No, you are not to blame.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.440
It is, I think, the heat.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.040
The server is locking up and it's

01:56.040 --> 01:59.080
behaving very much in a hardware failure kind of way.

01:59.080 --> 02:01.320
I got in this morning and I went to connect

02:01.320 --> 02:03.880
to our beloved Arch server.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.640
And my web dashboard for this thing

02:05.640 --> 02:07.960
I'm working on for the road trip didn't load.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.080
And the server has been so dang reliable,

02:10.080 --> 02:12.760
I thought to myself, oh, it must be my workstation.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.280
So let me check network manager.

02:14.280 --> 02:15.080
It says I'm connected.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.560
Let me see if I can ping other stuff.

02:16.560 --> 02:17.840
Hmm.

02:17.840 --> 02:19.920
Well, all right, I'll go to the console.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.360
So I go down to the garage slash server room.

02:22.360 --> 02:23.800
And I access the console.

02:23.800 --> 02:24.800
And it's just dead.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.360
No response, nothing.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.200
I type in nothing, no blinking cursor, nothing, Wes.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.440
Nothing on the console.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.360
So this is not just a network problem.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.280
It's not the NIC going out.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.720
This thing's dead.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.240
The server is so reliable that it did cross my mind that it

02:38.240 --> 02:40.200
might actually be a bad keyboard.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.480
So I swapped out the keyboard.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.720
Because I thought, no way, the server's locked up.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.000
It's never locked up.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.560
The server has actually never crashed on us,

02:48.560 --> 02:50.440
unless we screw up an update.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.520
It's been a rock.

02:51.520 --> 02:52.360
No, that's been it, yeah.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.840
Sometimes we did stuff, and ZFS didn't build right,

02:54.840 --> 02:56.480
and our root file system wouldn't mount.

02:56.480 --> 02:58.920
But that was on us, not the server.

02:58.920 --> 03:00.960
And honestly, every time we learned a lesson,

03:00.960 --> 03:02.240
and it's been really solid.

03:02.240 --> 03:05.760
And so I would swap out the keyboard, still not working.

03:05.760 --> 03:09.360
I do a hard reset, power it off, power it back on.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.320
And I'm watching the console output like a hawk

03:11.320 --> 03:12.000
at this point.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.880
Every BIOS post message, when grub loads, then system D.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.840
Like, I'm watching every single thing.

03:18.840 --> 03:19.840
The console loads up.

03:19.840 --> 03:20.520
I type on it.

03:20.520 --> 03:21.440
I get logged in.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.760
I can ping stuff.

03:22.760 --> 03:23.720
OK.

03:23.720 --> 03:24.640
I go back to my desk.

03:24.640 --> 03:25.640
The web dashboards load.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.840
A few things need to be cleaned up.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.800
A couple of the applications crapped themselves.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.120
But I fix all that up.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.520
Good to go.

03:31.520 --> 03:32.680
So I come down to the studio.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.400
I jump on the stream, and I'm kvetching

03:34.400 --> 03:36.560
about how our server crashed this morning.

03:36.560 --> 03:38.400
But I think everything's OK.

03:38.400 --> 03:41.760
And I go check on it, and it doesn't respond.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.080
And again, I go out to the console,

03:44.080 --> 03:45.240
and it's totally locked up.

03:45.240 --> 03:46.280
And this is what, Wes?

03:46.280 --> 03:49.880
Like 20 minutes ago, 15 minutes ago, maybe, at the most?

03:49.880 --> 03:52.640
Yeah, pretty much, right before we get on the air.

03:52.640 --> 03:53.640
My baby, Wes.

03:53.640 --> 03:54.280
My baby.

03:54.280 --> 03:55.400
And I think it's dying.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.560
I think the heat here in the Pacific Northwest

03:57.560 --> 03:59.040
has just crushed it.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.600
It has been too much.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.680
And the worst part is it's about to get hotter

04:02.680 --> 04:03.840
over the next few days.

04:03.840 --> 04:04.080
Right.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.200
You won't be here to manage it.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.680
And you do your best at the studio,

04:06.680 --> 04:09.800
as I've seen trying to manage airflow, cool it off

04:09.800 --> 04:12.120
when you can, which isn't always possible.

04:12.120 --> 04:15.160
And then not only is this a valuable archival resource

04:15.160 --> 04:18.120
for us at the studio, it's a back door into the studio

04:18.120 --> 04:20.360
with WireGuard as our server there.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.320
And I know it hosts a bunch of personal stuff

04:22.320 --> 04:24.640
in some of your media collection, which you probably

04:24.640 --> 04:26.640
want if you're about to go on the road.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.840
Not only that, but it's going to be an environment where

04:28.840 --> 04:31.320
I can run this web top application that we're

04:31.320 --> 04:34.920
about to talk about and have a remotely accessible machine

04:34.920 --> 04:36.040
on the studio LAN.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.880
And that, to me, is going to be extremely valuable when

04:38.880 --> 04:42.880
I am in limited compute and limited mobility with LTE

04:42.880 --> 04:43.920
connectivity.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.720
Having a rock solid always on workstation

04:46.720 --> 04:48.760
that can do a lot of my heavy lifting

04:48.760 --> 04:51.360
was going to be a key part of my on the road strategy.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.200
I think now I'm going to move that off to Linode

04:53.200 --> 04:54.880
because I just can't count on this local server.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.760
I'm just going to have to deploy this on Linode

04:56.760 --> 04:57.560
and run it there.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.320
And they're going to have plenty of compute

04:59.320 --> 05:00.600
and plenty of networking.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.800
But it's unfortunate it's going this way.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.120
It's an old box, too.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.600
We bought it from Unix Surplus used,

05:06.600 --> 05:08.960
I think in 2017, 2018.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.880
I can't remember exactly when.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.560
So that means it's been through a couple of winters

05:13.560 --> 05:15.280
and a couple of summers.

05:15.280 --> 05:19.920
It's got an Intel Xeon L5640 24 core CPU.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.360
So it's got quite a bit of cores for what we need.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.840
And it's got 56 gigs of RAM.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.800
I can't remember exactly how we got there.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.520
But it's got 56 gigs of RAM in it.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.700
And it's done a really great job for us.

05:31.700 --> 05:34.120
But now it doesn't seem to be able to stay up more than 20,

05:34.120 --> 05:35.680
25 minutes.

05:35.680 --> 05:40.760
And I am legit going through an emotional process.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.640
I am grieving the loss of our server right now,

05:43.640 --> 05:46.260
especially because I'm six days out from the road trip.

05:46.260 --> 05:48.920
So I can't even get anything to replace it,

05:48.920 --> 05:52.440
even if I had the money to replace it right now.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.840
There's just not the time to get it in place, no.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.360
I mean, you really don't appreciate these things

05:56.360 --> 05:58.280
and how reliable and how much you depend on them

05:58.280 --> 05:59.760
until you start questioning it.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.360
Yeah, when I realized what a rocket had been

06:02.360 --> 06:05.320
and what it feels like now, it's like I'm

06:05.320 --> 06:06.920
losing a friend.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.880
But the road show goes on, in theory.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.580
And our first meetup is scheduled for August 7,

06:13.580 --> 06:16.160
which really is not that far away in Salt Lake City.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.620
Our second meetup that is scheduled

06:17.620 --> 06:19.040
is in Denver, August 20.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.080
Plus, we will have the micro meetup link available,

06:21.080 --> 06:23.040
where you can submit a request to me with,

06:23.040 --> 06:24.920
I just have a few questions in there for you.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.840
And we'll have a route with a live tracker.

06:26.840 --> 06:29.240
Our own tracks installation is still up and running,

06:29.240 --> 06:31.120
because that's up on a Linode box.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.120
And so we'll have the live map that will give you

06:33.120 --> 06:35.440
my location as we go around.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.480
But we have a lot to get into today,

06:37.480 --> 06:39.040
despite the state of my server.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.480
So before we go any further, we've

06:40.480 --> 06:41.840
got to bring in our virtual lug.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.560
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

06:43.560 --> 06:44.060
Hello.

06:44.060 --> 06:44.560
Hello.

06:44.560 --> 06:46.640
Hello.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.280
Hello, Chris.

06:47.280 --> 06:48.560
Hello, everybody.

06:48.560 --> 06:51.200
About 22 of you on the Mumble server today.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.320
Linuxonplug.com slash Mumble, if you'd ever like to join us.

06:54.320 --> 06:58.440
We have a quiet listening area and an on-air area.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.880
It's a great way to just listen to the show in real time.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.440
Talk about a low latency way to do it.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.440
But the other thing that's just kind of cool

07:04.440 --> 07:05.680
is it's all free software.

07:05.680 --> 07:09.720
If you join like on a Linux box, or I suppose a PSD machine,

07:09.720 --> 07:12.320
and run Mumble, we're running this entire stack

07:12.320 --> 07:14.040
in the studio on Linux.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.420
Mumble is free software.

07:15.420 --> 07:17.200
So you can listen to the show in real time

07:17.200 --> 07:19.680
with low latency, high quality Opus audio

07:19.680 --> 07:21.160
when you connect in on Mumble.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.780
And if you ever want to join us on air to jump in on something,

07:23.780 --> 07:24.760
you can.

07:24.760 --> 07:28.200
Like the Framework laptop, which is our first community news

07:28.200 --> 07:30.880
item this week, we've all been waiting for the reviews

07:30.880 --> 07:34.160
to land for this ultimate right to repair machine.

07:34.160 --> 07:37.920
And it seems like overall, the reviews

07:37.920 --> 07:40.320
have been a lot more positive than I think probably either

07:40.320 --> 07:41.480
one of us expected.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.560
Yeah, really.

07:42.560 --> 07:45.560
I mean, the biggest negative that seems to have popped up,

07:45.560 --> 07:48.660
and unfortunately, more than a few times at this point,

07:48.660 --> 07:50.560
is the battery life.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.660
But maybe we can take the Verge's review

07:52.660 --> 07:54.040
as a bit of a case study.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.880
They took a look at a model, came with let's see

07:56.880 --> 08:02.360
the configuration here, display 13.5 inch 3-2 aspect ratio.

08:02.360 --> 08:05.880
Yeah, 3 by 2 aspect ratio is kind of unique.

08:05.880 --> 08:06.520
I like that.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.360
It's your only option, but I like it.

08:08.360 --> 08:15.000
Yeah, 2256 by 1504, and not a touch screen before you ask.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.200
Comes with an Intel Core i5-1135G7,

08:20.200 --> 08:22.800
and only 8 gigs of RAM on this model.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.320
But don't worry, you can get more

08:24.320 --> 08:26.120
if you're building this for yourself.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.320
And that price, I think for configured,

08:28.320 --> 08:30.680
as configured like that, is just under $1,000,

08:30.680 --> 08:33.080
or basically $1,000 at $999.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.320
But the notes about the battery struck me

08:35.320 --> 08:38.860
as potentially solvable, because the whole idea

08:38.860 --> 08:41.720
about the framework is that so many parts are replaceable,

08:41.720 --> 08:44.880
swappable, and the battery is absolutely one of those.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.680
And so if this thing was successful,

08:46.680 --> 08:48.320
it'd be pretty easy for a third party

08:48.320 --> 08:51.080
or for framework themselves to build a higher capacity

08:51.080 --> 08:53.520
battery that you fit in there, assuming they could have

08:53.520 --> 08:54.920
around the same form factor.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.560
That's one of the weird things about talking

08:56.560 --> 08:58.800
about this laptop is I think, especially at this point,

08:58.800 --> 09:01.080
we're so used to just everything being soldered in

09:01.080 --> 09:03.880
and having to optimize what am I buying right now,

09:03.880 --> 09:06.760
because I can't change it and it has to last.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.960
And it's a little bit of you have to unlearn that when

09:08.960 --> 09:10.320
you're configuring this thing.

09:10.320 --> 09:11.000
True.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
And ByteBitten, it looks like there

09:13.000 --> 09:16.080
may be a touch screen in the future, possibly.

09:16.080 --> 09:19.880
Yes, so what some other channels showed

09:19.880 --> 09:23.800
was there is on the motherboard a connector for touch screen.

09:23.800 --> 09:29.240
So when you use it in the framework chassis,

09:29.240 --> 09:31.040
because you can take out the motherboard

09:31.040 --> 09:34.040
and create a small form factor design with it,

09:34.040 --> 09:37.240
and you put then a touch screen on it, it's all possible.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.400
Yeah, I'd love to see that kind of thing

09:39.400 --> 09:41.720
take off where other people start building parts for it

09:41.720 --> 09:44.160
too, but you'd really have to have some mass user adoption.

09:44.160 --> 09:46.480
I think that's kind of the whole elephant

09:46.480 --> 09:48.440
in the room about the framework laptop

09:48.440 --> 09:51.520
is how it ends up playing out is going

09:51.520 --> 09:52.920
to depend on how successful it is,

09:52.920 --> 09:54.200
because they're not going to make

09:54.200 --> 09:56.160
all of these additional modules, and there's not

09:56.160 --> 09:57.920
going to be a bunch of upgrade components

09:57.920 --> 10:00.680
and multiple iterations on the motherboard and CPU

10:00.680 --> 10:03.080
that fit in the same chassis unless this thing sells

10:03.080 --> 10:03.960
like crazy.

10:03.960 --> 10:05.720
It seems like that's the other part of this

10:05.720 --> 10:06.920
that has to be successful.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.960
Yeah, I mean, I think, thankfully, it seems

10:08.960 --> 10:10.440
like a decent laptop anyway.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.160
So if it doesn't take off, it still

10:12.160 --> 10:15.680
could be a fine machine to just get work done and run Linux on.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.400
But you're right.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.600
If it does take off, the value proposition

10:18.600 --> 10:19.920
could really be a lot more.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.320
You could easily get this thing repaired.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.200
You could find spare parts.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.680
You could swap things out, upgrade it as time went on,

10:24.680 --> 10:27.880
change out the ports as things got fancier.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.360
That would be pretty exciting.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.320
If you look at the Venn diagram of customers

10:31.320 --> 10:33.960
for the framework laptop, Linux user and write

10:33.960 --> 10:37.600
to repair users, I think they overlap a lot in this diagram.

10:37.600 --> 10:40.760
And depending on where you fall down on the write

10:40.760 --> 10:43.320
to repair issue and how important to you

10:43.320 --> 10:45.880
a machine like this is, I think pushes you over the edge

10:45.880 --> 10:46.960
if you want to order this or not.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.100
And it's been really interesting,

10:48.100 --> 10:50.360
because I've gotten a lot of notes from people that

10:50.360 --> 10:51.400
definitely fall into that.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.360
I believe in write to repair.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.600
And I want a system that can run Linux.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.880
I like this idea.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.200
And they're pulling the trigger.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.880
And I know you've been on the fence, Wes.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.720
And I think at the core of your indecision

11:01.720 --> 11:04.760
is where you stand on write to repair.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.680
And not so much as, of course, you want it to exist.

11:07.680 --> 11:10.080
Everybody wants write to repair to be a thing.

11:10.080 --> 11:14.080
But I'm curious how important you feel it is to you personally.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.360
You know, that's a tough one.

11:15.360 --> 11:16.780
I do think it's really important.

11:16.780 --> 11:20.520
But I feel like I've been a little burned, skeptical,

11:20.520 --> 11:23.760
just sort of, maybe it's just too pessimistic, honestly,

11:23.760 --> 11:25.080
at the end of the day.

11:25.080 --> 11:26.720
It's been hard to be able to engage

11:26.720 --> 11:29.440
as a consumer who wants sort of the higher end of things.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.440
You know, who really does care about computing,

11:31.440 --> 11:35.280
likes nice computers, uses nice computers, not just for sport,

11:35.280 --> 11:38.640
but for work and for getting stuff done.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.440
And up until now, it's been hard.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.880
You do have some of that stuff maybe in the ThinkPad line,

11:42.880 --> 11:43.380
especially.

11:43.380 --> 11:45.440
But basically, everywhere else, this

11:45.440 --> 11:47.240
isn't really a choice you've gotten to make.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.600
So unfortunately, it seems like there's

11:49.600 --> 11:52.480
a bit of a barrier or an activation potential

11:52.480 --> 11:55.920
for me emotionally to sort of be willing to believe

11:55.920 --> 11:58.920
in this potential again, even though I really do want to.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.760
Carl, it sounds like it does match up for you.

12:01.760 --> 12:02.640
You ordered one.

12:02.640 --> 12:03.280
Yes, sir.

12:03.280 --> 12:04.400
I'm looking forward to getting it.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.720
I'm going to be in batch two, which

12:05.720 --> 12:07.160
is supposed to ship in August.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.440
I'm guessing you probably went with the DIY edition,

12:09.440 --> 12:10.520
so it's OS free.

12:10.520 --> 12:11.240
Absolutely.

12:11.240 --> 12:14.840
Yeah, I didn't get any storage RAM or OS for it.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.680
So I'll handle those whenever I get it.

12:16.680 --> 12:19.100
In fact, I just placed a new egg order for RAM and storage

12:19.100 --> 12:21.640
today, and I placed the pre-order for the laptop

12:21.640 --> 12:22.800
a week or two ago.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.720
I miss the idea of just ordering the components

12:25.720 --> 12:27.360
I want for my laptop from Newegg.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.120
That's what a concept.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.160
That's crazy, Carl.

12:30.160 --> 12:31.720
Like, you can do that?

12:31.720 --> 12:32.840
Wow.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.040
Yeah, it's exciting.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.680
What's going to be tricky, though, is what Linux

12:36.680 --> 12:39.240
you decide to put on there, because you're

12:39.240 --> 12:42.560
going to need something with a pretty new kernel.

12:42.560 --> 12:47.120
Seems like 5.11, maybe the bare minimum, ideally kernel 5.12.

12:47.120 --> 12:50.200
And so Jim Salter had a hard time getting Ubuntu 20.04

12:50.200 --> 12:51.760
working on it, obviously, because it

12:51.760 --> 12:53.200
has such an older kernel.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.320
And even 21.04 wasn't perfect.

12:55.320 --> 12:58.800
And I think if I'm just remembering off the top of my

12:58.800 --> 13:02.600
head, I think 21.04 ships with 5.11.

13:02.600 --> 13:06.120
You'd want a distro that ships with 5.11 or 5.12.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.520
I've been looking on the framework laptop form,

13:08.520 --> 13:11.480
and they actually have a whole Linux section, which

13:11.480 --> 13:13.720
I'll link to in the show notes for just getting

13:13.720 --> 13:15.800
Linux on the DIY edition.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.600
And I would say probably what seems

13:17.600 --> 13:19.600
to be the most popular distro reading through there

13:19.600 --> 13:23.040
is Fedora, although there's a poll that

13:23.040 --> 13:25.800
was conducted just two days ago.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.560
Or no, no longer than that, but the last vote was two days ago.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.200
And Ubuntu was the largest in the poll,

13:30.200 --> 13:32.360
so people are also probably doing Ubuntu then

13:32.360 --> 13:35.360
maybe with the kernel PPA backport, possibly.

13:35.360 --> 13:37.520
That might work.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.020
But if I were going to get a framework,

13:39.020 --> 13:42.320
I would probably try to run Fedora or an Arch-based distro

13:42.320 --> 13:44.680
on there, just that way you get all that new kernel goodness.

13:44.680 --> 13:47.440
Because not only is it an 11th gen Intel,

13:47.440 --> 13:49.640
but there's also just a lot of new components in there.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.760
It's a lot of USB 3.0 stuff.

13:51.760 --> 13:53.120
I would go with a newer kernel.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.200
Yes, I mean, this is just not in the category

13:55.200 --> 13:58.040
of off-the-shelf laptop in any way yet.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.920
So if you're interested in this, you

13:59.920 --> 14:02.600
should probably be prepared to do some tinkering.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.560
Should we talk a little BSD in our Linux podcast, Wes?

14:05.560 --> 14:09.120
Oh, it's been too long, but our friends over at FreeBSD

14:09.120 --> 14:11.160
are working on some interesting stuff,

14:11.160 --> 14:13.560
including a new installer.

14:13.560 --> 14:16.280
Although this one has a bit of a twist.

14:16.280 --> 14:20.840
This new experimental installer is web-based,

14:20.840 --> 14:22.680
with the interface running from a web browser

14:22.680 --> 14:25.680
either locally on the machine you're installing FreeBSD on,

14:25.680 --> 14:28.000
or it can actually run on a remote system.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.320
What a cool idea.

14:30.320 --> 14:32.360
And I don't think this is absolutely the first time

14:32.360 --> 14:34.620
I've ever seen this executed.

14:34.620 --> 14:36.840
I feel like an early Debian installer prototype

14:36.840 --> 14:37.440
did this too.

14:37.440 --> 14:40.440
But the idea that the whole installer is web-based,

14:40.440 --> 14:43.680
and you either just do it in a web browser on a live session

14:43.680 --> 14:47.640
on the box, or you do it on a remote system,

14:47.640 --> 14:51.440
seems actually kind of like a compelling idea for FreeBSD,

14:51.440 --> 14:54.280
especially since most of them, probably a lot of them,

14:54.280 --> 14:56.040
are being deployed headless.

14:56.040 --> 14:57.880
What do you think of a web-based installer?

14:57.880 --> 15:00.360
OK, it seems really practical, but the troll in me

15:00.360 --> 15:03.120
just wants to say, this is one step away from an Electron

15:03.120 --> 15:04.160
installer, right?

15:04.160 --> 15:05.240
I mean, yeah.

15:05.240 --> 15:07.720
Like, why not ship it as an Electron app on the desktop?

15:07.720 --> 15:10.080
What's the difference at that point?

15:10.080 --> 15:11.680
I mean, I don't know, though.

15:11.680 --> 15:14.520
It could probably be a pretty simple, well, maybe not.

15:14.520 --> 15:17.080
It could be a monster of a web application.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.240
That could be its Achilles heel, I suppose,

15:19.240 --> 15:21.600
is to create a competent web installer.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.200
It may have to be an absolute monster,

15:23.200 --> 15:24.620
especially because you're probably

15:24.620 --> 15:27.960
going to want some abstraction in there at various levels.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.420
And that's probably going to be tricky to even wrap your head

15:30.420 --> 15:31.200
around.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.620
They're also working on improvements

15:32.620 --> 15:35.480
to their Linux compatibility layer, which I think

15:35.480 --> 15:37.720
is based on Linux 5.7 right now.

15:37.720 --> 15:41.120
And it looks like they're focusing a lot on AMD Radeon

15:41.120 --> 15:44.560
and newer Intel GPU support to get those fancied up.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.720
Also nice to see is that the Hello System project,

15:47.720 --> 15:50.800
which we talked about a little bit ago on the show,

15:50.800 --> 15:54.120
the freeBSD-powered desktop OS, well, that's

15:54.120 --> 15:55.160
been steadily progressing.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.760
They had a recent release, and they're making great progress

15:57.760 --> 15:58.960
towards their next one.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.040
Wes, that's the project being worked on by the App Image

16:01.040 --> 16:01.720
founder, right?

16:01.720 --> 16:03.320
Indeed it is.

16:03.320 --> 16:06.040
Hello System is one to keep your eye on.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.920
It's not for those of you who are offended by things that

16:08.920 --> 16:10.720
try to look like Mac OS, because they're just

16:10.720 --> 16:14.600
leaning hard into that whole UI paradigm and workflow

16:14.600 --> 16:16.920
and just trying to create a BSD-based system.

16:16.920 --> 16:19.160
Michael Larbel, though, has a pretty good write-up over

16:19.160 --> 16:23.200
at Ferronix from the freeBSD community, so go check that out

16:23.200 --> 16:25.520
if you like yourself the BSD news.

16:25.520 --> 16:31.200
But we wanted to sneak in just a real quick deck update.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.160
There's some interesting technical details

16:33.160 --> 16:36.400
that we learned about the Steam Deck's Linux implementation.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.200
Not only will the Steam Deck be using Wayland,

16:39.200 --> 16:40.840
but it seems like once again they've

16:40.840 --> 16:42.960
decided to take on the hard problem of building

16:42.960 --> 16:44.160
their own compositor.

16:44.160 --> 16:47.920
Building their own compositor, yes, that's right.

16:47.920 --> 16:52.200
It appears Valve's Pierre-Lou Graffé has developed GameScope

16:52.200 --> 16:56.120
as a follow-up to the Steam Comp Manager, which was previously

16:56.120 --> 17:00.760
used for this role, on the original Debian-based Steam OS.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.280
He tweeted a short video of a game

17:02.280 --> 17:06.280
being played on the Deck, and it had a crosshair cursor,

17:06.280 --> 17:09.680
which people noticed and then asked him about.

17:09.680 --> 17:10.640
Nerds.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.280
Yeah, exactly, right?

17:12.280 --> 17:15.160
He replied, yes, this is Steam OS on the Deck,

17:15.160 --> 17:17.000
and it uses GameScope.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.200
The cursor is drawn by xWayland.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.040
Huh.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.960
GameScope is the new compositor, eh?

17:21.960 --> 17:24.320
GameScope is the new compositor, and there's

17:24.320 --> 17:28.520
some bits in there, too, that suggests maybe Steam OS 3.0 is

17:28.520 --> 17:29.680
powered by Vulkan.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.160
That wouldn't surprise me at all.

17:31.160 --> 17:33.240
I think it would require Vulkan just for Proton

17:33.240 --> 17:35.000
to work completely.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.080
I noticed that Neil, who's not here today,

17:37.080 --> 17:40.240
has submitted a proposal to create a spin of Fedora

17:40.240 --> 17:45.280
targeted at the Steam Deck that would be Fedora for game

17:45.280 --> 17:47.080
developers and players.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.520
And you wonder, what would the advantage of that be?

17:49.520 --> 17:51.960
But one advantage would be that then it

17:51.960 --> 17:54.240
could be essentially a meta package of sorts

17:54.240 --> 17:56.640
that you could DNF install and get all of that stuff

17:56.640 --> 17:59.520
you need to create and develop games on Linux.

17:59.520 --> 18:03.000
So that actually could be a pretty slick solution.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.880
But right now, we're just going to wait and see.

18:05.880 --> 18:09.240
We haven't seen the release of Steam OS 3.0,

18:09.240 --> 18:12.360
and we're getting a trickle feed of information.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.440
I'm hoping I'd love for one day to be

18:14.440 --> 18:16.480
able to chat with somebody at Valve about the Linux

18:16.480 --> 18:18.000
implementation, because we just love to geek out

18:18.000 --> 18:19.320
about that kind of stuff.

18:19.320 --> 18:20.040
We'll see.

18:20.040 --> 18:20.880
Maybe one day.

18:20.880 --> 18:24.360
If you're listening at Valve, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

18:24.360 --> 18:25.040
Let us know.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.400
We can come to you.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.080
No problem.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.000
That's right.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.560
All right, well, one more community news item before we

18:31.560 --> 18:32.040
go.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.240
We deployed a matrix server.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.480
It continues to grow.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.920
The information is at linuxunplug.com.

18:36.920 --> 18:39.920
And it's a project that we watch with a lot of interest.

18:39.920 --> 18:43.160
And it seems that Element, the creators of the Element chat

18:43.160 --> 18:45.800
client, and they also work on the core matrix protocol,

18:45.800 --> 18:47.880
just raised a significant chunk of money.

18:47.880 --> 18:53.040
Yeah, they've just raised $30 million of Series B funding

18:53.040 --> 18:55.480
in order to further accelerate matrix development

18:55.480 --> 18:57.440
and improve Element, the chat client.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.040
It's a little confusing, because Element's

18:59.040 --> 19:02.320
both the name of the client and the name of the startup.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.440
Yeah, I wasn't really sure how to explain that.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.280
You're right.

19:05.280 --> 19:08.160
And they also work on the core matrix protocol as well.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.000
They're like some of the core contributors.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.720
The people that are throwing in the money this time

19:12.720 --> 19:15.640
is led by Protocol Labs and MetaPlanet.

19:15.640 --> 19:17.240
That's a fund that was established

19:17.240 --> 19:19.480
by the co-founder of Skype and Kazaa.

19:19.480 --> 19:22.520
And both Protocol Labs and MetaPlanet are big fans

19:22.520 --> 19:25.400
and have publicly supported decentralized communication

19:25.400 --> 19:26.800
in the past.

19:26.800 --> 19:30.240
So it does seem likely that this is a great source of funding

19:30.240 --> 19:34.040
that their visions of how they want to see communications

19:34.040 --> 19:36.880
and where Element is taking things line up.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.520
Because when you see funding like this,

19:38.520 --> 19:40.840
you wonder, OK, well, what's their agenda?

19:40.840 --> 19:43.640
But it seems, early days here, but it seems

19:43.640 --> 19:45.520
like things are lining up.

19:45.520 --> 19:49.040
It has led some folks to wonder that since Protocol Labs is

19:49.040 --> 19:52.960
involved, might there be some overlap between IPFS

19:52.960 --> 19:54.320
and matrix?

19:54.320 --> 19:56.040
And at least in this initial announcement,

19:56.040 --> 19:59.600
it sounds like, yeah, where the tech makes sense anyway,

19:59.600 --> 20:04.280
the teams are looking to work more closely together.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.600
Linode.com slash unplugged.

20:06.600 --> 20:09.840
Go there to get $100 in credit for 60 days on a new account,

20:09.840 --> 20:13.000
and you support the show by going to linode.com slash

20:13.000 --> 20:13.680
unplugged.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.560
Linode is our hosting provider for everything

20:15.560 --> 20:17.520
that we've built in the last couple of years,

20:17.520 --> 20:19.800
and we just doubled down when we went independent.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.960
I was using them for about two years

20:21.960 --> 20:24.920
before we made the switch for the JB infrastructure.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.920
When we got the keys back to the kingdom,

20:26.920 --> 20:29.720
when we went independent again, we went this direction,

20:29.720 --> 20:31.040
and we've just gone all in.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.760
Their infrastructure is super solid.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.240
It's flexible, and it's fast.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.600
You can focus on your project and not your infrastructure.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.800
And while I'm here right now dealing with a server

20:39.800 --> 20:42.680
outage on our LAN, my first thought

20:42.680 --> 20:45.400
is there's no way I can get a replacement server in six days

20:45.400 --> 20:47.080
before I leave or get one set up.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.440
I'm going to look through the services we're

20:48.440 --> 20:50.320
running on our local host here, and I'm

20:50.320 --> 20:51.640
going to spin them up on Linode.

20:51.640 --> 20:55.680
And that's just going to be the quickest and most reliable

20:55.680 --> 20:57.120
solution for a lot of this stuff.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.880
They have 11 data centers to choose from,

20:58.880 --> 21:00.680
so I'll probably pick something centralized

21:00.680 --> 21:02.320
for where I'll be traveling.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.680
Every service level they have is backed by the best customer

21:04.680 --> 21:07.000
support in the business, and when that matters,

21:07.000 --> 21:08.240
it really, really matters.

21:08.240 --> 21:12.080
And what Linode has done is they have honed and crafted

21:12.080 --> 21:13.520
a fine product.

21:13.520 --> 21:16.600
They've been doing this for 18 years,

21:16.600 --> 21:19.040
and they've really focused on just making it better

21:19.040 --> 21:21.480
over all of those years, and they have remained independent

21:21.480 --> 21:23.320
the entire time.

21:23.320 --> 21:24.120
Wow.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.680
I have so much respect for that.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.520
Imagine the headwinds they were facing

21:28.520 --> 21:31.320
when some of the larger hyperscalers launched,

21:31.320 --> 21:33.200
like when AWS came around.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.680
And then when VC funded competitors

21:35.680 --> 21:37.880
came that could basically just burn money

21:37.880 --> 21:39.800
and they just brought on another VC anytime

21:39.800 --> 21:41.480
they needed more money.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.960
They had to remain competitive, and they

21:43.960 --> 21:46.600
had to make their product more appealing than people

21:46.600 --> 21:50.360
that essentially had endless money on either side of them.

21:50.360 --> 21:51.640
And they did it.

21:51.640 --> 21:53.480
They made their product more competitive,

21:53.480 --> 21:55.160
and I watched them do it.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.040
I watched them, and they won me over.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.760
I didn't have to choose Linode.

21:58.760 --> 22:01.280
I chose to come over to Linode after watching

22:01.280 --> 22:03.600
them respond to the market and build something better,

22:03.600 --> 22:05.600
but stay true to their original vision

22:05.600 --> 22:09.040
about making cloud computing accessible and affordable

22:09.040 --> 22:10.760
for just darn near everybody.

22:10.760 --> 22:14.160
Their prices are 30% to 50% less than other providers,

22:14.160 --> 22:16.840
and their systems are just screamers.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.960
They continually invest in the hardware.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.320
They know what they have to do to remain competitive,

22:21.320 --> 22:22.520
and they're all about it.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.480
It's not like one of the many businesses that they run,

22:25.480 --> 22:27.800
or it's not like one of the very, very many businesses

22:27.800 --> 22:29.400
that their VC is funding.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.160
It's not part of their business.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.160
This is what they do.

22:33.160 --> 22:36.240
It is totally all about the best experience

22:36.240 --> 22:37.720
of running stuff on Linux.

22:37.720 --> 22:40.000
And they got a ton of distros for you to choose from.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.600
They've got bare metal machines in the works right now.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.760
I just recently set up a box to just hold some data for me

22:45.760 --> 22:47.140
up in the cloud, and I have a system here

22:47.140 --> 22:49.040
where I select what datasets I want to go up,

22:49.040 --> 22:51.040
and it uploads it up to a Linode box.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.320
On the back end, I have my file system mounted

22:53.320 --> 22:57.200
to their object storage, so it just expands as I need it.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.440
It's so flexible, so powerful,

22:59.440 --> 23:02.640
and now I am really appreciating how reliable it is.

23:02.640 --> 23:03.980
But I'd love you to try it out.

23:03.980 --> 23:05.880
Maybe it's part of a multi-cloud strategy.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.560
Maybe you want to performance test your system,

23:07.560 --> 23:10.460
or maybe you need a backup server like I do.

23:10.460 --> 23:12.280
So go to linode.com slash unplug.

23:12.280 --> 23:14.520
Get that $100 for your new account,

23:14.520 --> 23:16.040
and just try this stuff out.

23:16.040 --> 23:18.600
Go build something, or maybe learn something,

23:18.600 --> 23:20.380
and you support the show while you're doing it.

23:20.380 --> 23:22.900
There are a lot of ways and a lot of companies

23:22.900 --> 23:24.440
that let you host stuff.

23:24.440 --> 23:27.980
I mean, there's just an unbelievable amount now.

23:27.980 --> 23:30.480
But none of them, none of them check all the boxes

23:30.480 --> 23:31.300
like Linode.

23:31.300 --> 23:32.460
When it comes to the performance,

23:32.460 --> 23:33.840
when it comes to the customer support,

23:33.840 --> 23:36.260
when it comes to the reliability, the clean dashboard,

23:36.260 --> 23:38.300
the API, which I don't talk about enough,

23:38.300 --> 23:41.400
the command line client, which I also don't talk about,

23:41.400 --> 23:43.020
the whole picture with Linode.

23:43.020 --> 23:44.040
And it's just one of those things

23:44.040 --> 23:46.060
you have to experience for yourself.

23:46.060 --> 23:48.420
Linode.com slash unplugged.

23:51.500 --> 23:55.180
During our upcoming Jupiter Colony reunion road trip,

23:55.180 --> 23:57.580
I suspect there will definitely be some moments

23:57.580 --> 24:02.540
when bandwidth and resources are a little constrained.

24:02.540 --> 24:04.780
But that can't stop the shows.

24:04.780 --> 24:06.380
They must go on.

24:06.380 --> 24:08.820
That's what led us on our quest

24:08.820 --> 24:12.940
to build a powerful workstation in the cloud.

24:12.940 --> 24:15.540
That could be our steady state, a system to rely on,

24:15.540 --> 24:18.300
a system we can jump back onto anytime we need a lot

24:18.300 --> 24:20.140
of compute, a lot of bandwidth, need

24:20.140 --> 24:22.260
to download a lot of resources, and we don't want to use

24:22.260 --> 24:23.840
maybe a constrained mobile connection

24:23.840 --> 24:28.500
or whatever sketchy coffee shop Wi-Fi we can find at the time.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.740
But we needed a way to do that, and ideally,

24:30.740 --> 24:33.020
a full graphical workstation because some of our tools,

24:33.020 --> 24:36.340
we might be rendering audio, we might be streaming something.

24:36.340 --> 24:38.540
We don't want to be constrained just by a console.

24:38.540 --> 24:40.840
And so we decided to give WebTop a try.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.980
We had heard this lets you do this,

24:42.980 --> 24:44.900
and we thought maybe eventually we

24:44.900 --> 24:48.260
could turn this into like a remote rendering system.

24:48.260 --> 24:52.120
Because when Wes and I do Linux action news on Sunday,

24:52.120 --> 24:56.420
it's gotten to the point now where the export of our audio

24:56.420 --> 24:59.480
is one to one almost with the length of the audio

24:59.480 --> 25:01.780
because we're doing a new workflow where we're

25:01.780 --> 25:03.700
doing the effects in a new way.

25:03.700 --> 25:05.740
And it's a super cool learning experience,

25:05.740 --> 25:08.580
and it's both really impressed Wes and I, I think,

25:08.580 --> 25:11.060
with what you can do on Linux now with audio,

25:11.060 --> 25:13.380
even when it requires like a Windows plug-in or something

25:13.380 --> 25:14.100
like that.

25:14.100 --> 25:17.340
But it also has cost us a lot in render time.

25:17.340 --> 25:19.020
And so we thought after the road trip,

25:19.020 --> 25:21.460
this is probably something we'd keep around.

25:21.460 --> 25:23.780
I initially was thinking we could use the NAS here

25:23.780 --> 25:28.300
in the studio because it has 24 cores we could use for rendering.

25:28.300 --> 25:33.060
But then later, like 20 minutes ago, 15 minutes ago,

25:33.060 --> 25:34.820
I started thinking maybe we want to do this

25:34.820 --> 25:37.100
on like a big old powerful Linode.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.300
And I know, Wes, you jumped in there last night

25:39.300 --> 25:41.180
and tried to mess around with Reaper

25:41.180 --> 25:42.260
and try to get it running.

25:42.260 --> 25:44.580
Before we get into WebTop and all of that,

25:44.580 --> 25:47.940
I'm just curious how far you're able to push it as a desktop.

25:47.940 --> 25:49.180
I mean, pretty far.

25:49.180 --> 25:51.100
I ultimately ran into some issues

25:51.100 --> 25:53.980
getting some of the weirder wine apps to run.

25:53.980 --> 25:55.520
But I suspect some of those issues

25:55.520 --> 25:58.540
might have been the host system that I happened to pick.

25:58.540 --> 26:00.660
I picked one of our servers running on Linode

26:00.660 --> 26:01.740
to try this out.

26:01.740 --> 26:03.940
Probably should have spun up at something dedicated,

26:03.940 --> 26:05.820
but trying to be quick here.

26:05.820 --> 26:07.260
And that was a pretty old kernel.

26:07.260 --> 26:09.740
So I think some of the issues might have been related.

26:09.740 --> 26:14.340
But besides the few kind of out there wine applications,

26:14.340 --> 26:16.460
everything was working surprisingly well.

26:16.460 --> 26:18.780
I mean, I got Reaper up and running.

26:18.780 --> 26:21.940
I even re-streamed the Koda Radio live stream

26:21.940 --> 26:26.000
yesterday with OBS running in WebTop on this server,

26:26.000 --> 26:29.300
doing a video capture out of the browser.

26:29.300 --> 26:30.660
And it worked.

26:30.660 --> 26:31.620
That's impressive.

26:31.620 --> 26:33.800
So the technology here is WebTop.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.700
You get an Alpine or Ubuntu-based container

26:36.700 --> 26:39.060
that has a full desktop environment.

26:39.060 --> 26:42.340
And you access it using RDP.

26:42.340 --> 26:44.340
They bundle it with Guacamole, which

26:44.340 --> 26:47.820
is a XRDP web-embedded client.

26:47.820 --> 26:52.020
So the end product, the way you consume it, is at a URL.

26:52.020 --> 26:53.540
It just spins up a URL.

26:53.540 --> 26:55.260
I think it's like port 3000.

26:55.260 --> 26:56.420
You get a login prompt.

26:56.420 --> 26:58.580
You provide the user credentials,

26:58.580 --> 27:02.020
which is like ABC by default. And you're in.

27:02.020 --> 27:05.340
You get a desktop, and you pick which kind you want.

27:05.340 --> 27:07.020
I think by default, it's Alpine with Ubuntu

27:07.020 --> 27:08.660
if you don't specify a tag.

27:08.660 --> 27:11.180
But if you specify the tag, like we did,

27:11.180 --> 27:13.260
you can get Ubuntu with Plasma.

27:13.260 --> 27:16.220
And their version is based on Ubuntu 20.04,

27:16.220 --> 27:17.380
which is pretty reasonable.

27:17.380 --> 27:19.500
That's the LTS, makes a pretty good workstation.

27:19.500 --> 27:22.180
But it is a little funky, like Wes just hinted at,

27:22.180 --> 27:23.940
because it's a container.

27:23.940 --> 27:25.380
It's not a VM.

27:25.380 --> 27:28.200
It seems like a simple concept to wrap your noggin around

27:28.200 --> 27:29.420
when I say it.

27:29.420 --> 27:32.340
But when you're using it, you immediately forget

27:32.340 --> 27:33.620
you're inside a container.

27:33.620 --> 27:34.420
You really do.

27:34.420 --> 27:35.460
You really do.

27:35.460 --> 27:37.400
Yeah, and you just don't have any clue,

27:37.400 --> 27:39.020
until you do a uname.

27:39.020 --> 27:41.180
And you see some weird kernel version

27:41.180 --> 27:43.180
that doesn't ship in 20.04.

27:43.180 --> 27:44.980
And that's when it all dawned on me.

27:44.980 --> 27:46.480
Oh, yeah, right.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.460
There's a host system under this.

27:48.460 --> 27:49.840
So that would be a tip of mine.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.260
And I think Wes's, it sounds like,

27:51.260 --> 27:54.200
is maybe deploy this with a host OS that

27:54.200 --> 27:55.340
has a more modern kernel.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.560
So that way, any applications you

27:56.560 --> 27:58.360
might need in the container that take advantage

27:58.360 --> 28:00.860
of modern kernel features have that,

28:00.860 --> 28:02.460
because we did run into that.

28:02.460 --> 28:04.260
Yeah, it's like an upside and a downside,

28:04.260 --> 28:05.960
I think, of easy containerization, right?

28:05.960 --> 28:07.740
And this is one area where virtualization

28:07.740 --> 28:10.140
and containerization can go hand in hand, really.

28:10.140 --> 28:13.260
The whole setup process is really pretty straightforward

28:13.260 --> 28:14.980
if you're using Docker Compose, right?

28:14.980 --> 28:15.480
Oh, yeah.

28:15.480 --> 28:18.820
I mean, this is a great release from Linux Server I.O.

28:18.820 --> 28:20.740
Because they've just thought of a lot of stuff.

28:20.740 --> 28:21.700
And they hit on it here.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.620
They admit it kind of goes against the Docker grain,

28:24.620 --> 28:26.540
because you're running a whole bunch of services

28:26.540 --> 28:27.980
in a single container.

28:27.980 --> 28:29.360
And as it's set up by default, you

28:29.360 --> 28:31.820
should be aware that it's a weird kind of hodgepodge

28:31.820 --> 28:34.780
in between the way a lot of the Docker tooling is meant to work.

28:34.780 --> 28:36.300
But it's not really a VM.

28:36.300 --> 28:37.700
But it's somewhere in the middle.

28:37.700 --> 28:40.840
So by default, I think it's set up so everything in your home

28:40.840 --> 28:41.580
directory stays.

28:41.580 --> 28:44.180
But if you blow the container away and spin it back up,

28:44.180 --> 28:46.500
well, you're going to have to reconfigure the operating

28:46.500 --> 28:47.140
system.

28:47.140 --> 28:49.380
The performance is surprisingly good.

28:49.380 --> 28:53.020
Because like I mentioned, it's not using VNC or Spice.

28:53.020 --> 28:54.620
It's using RDP.

28:54.620 --> 28:56.380
And the XRDP project has actually

28:56.380 --> 28:58.180
gotten some love in the last few years.

28:58.180 --> 29:00.640
So it's stayed pretty performant.

29:00.640 --> 29:06.060
And I experienced a totally usable session of Plasma.

29:06.060 --> 29:07.500
I did turn the effects to instant

29:07.500 --> 29:09.500
just because I wanted to, to make it maybe feel

29:09.500 --> 29:10.200
a little faster.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.020
We're trying to be generous here.

29:12.020 --> 29:14.980
Yeah, and why waste the bandwidth

29:14.980 --> 29:17.780
trying to transmit and render a fade-in and fade-out

29:17.780 --> 29:20.380
of a menu when it can just be an instant pop-up?

29:20.380 --> 29:21.820
So that was my thinking.

29:21.820 --> 29:25.420
But I was able to use that kind of configuration of Plasma

29:25.420 --> 29:28.180
on an iPad over LTE.

29:28.180 --> 29:29.700
That was like my ultimate edge case,

29:29.700 --> 29:33.880
is could I turn an iPad into a Linux desktop that

29:33.880 --> 29:35.580
has its own dedicated connection so I'm not

29:35.580 --> 29:39.780
stealing from my limited LAN bandwidth when I'm on the road.

29:39.780 --> 29:40.740
And it worked.

29:40.740 --> 29:42.560
It freaking worked.

29:42.560 --> 29:45.220
And it was totally usable.

29:45.220 --> 29:47.860
And they have this nice little menu that expands out

29:47.860 --> 29:48.940
from the left-hand side.

29:48.940 --> 29:51.820
They have a little arrow, and you tap that arrow or click it.

29:51.820 --> 29:54.480
And a little drawer slides out.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.700
And in there, they have the ability

29:56.700 --> 30:00.060
to kick off a keyboard overlay if you need it.

30:00.060 --> 30:02.820
They have a clipboard, so you can copy and paste

30:02.820 --> 30:06.860
contents between your remote desktop and your local desktop.

30:06.860 --> 30:07.980
Super handy.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.940
So there, you can kind of copy out

30:09.940 --> 30:11.300
whatever is in the clipboard.

30:11.300 --> 30:13.060
And if you paste something in, that

30:13.060 --> 30:15.660
becomes the new clipboard contents in the container.

30:15.660 --> 30:16.500
That's so great.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.300
And I needed that almost immediately.

30:18.300 --> 30:18.820
So.

30:18.820 --> 30:19.900
Yeah, exactly.

30:19.900 --> 30:20.620
I was like, how do I?

30:20.620 --> 30:21.180
Oh, my gosh.

30:21.180 --> 30:21.900
I don't want to.

30:21.900 --> 30:23.140
OK, honestly, the first time I just

30:23.140 --> 30:24.820
used Netcat to get some data in there,

30:24.820 --> 30:27.260
that was before I discovered the handy clipboard support.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.020
Amazing.

30:28.020 --> 30:28.500
Amazing.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.220
And I love how you're playing like it was Netcat when you

30:30.220 --> 30:31.980
and I both know it was Magic Wormhole.

30:31.980 --> 30:32.700
I used both.

30:32.700 --> 30:34.860
OK, I just got tired of having to hop onto the host

30:34.860 --> 30:35.780
system to use Netcat.

30:35.780 --> 30:38.740
So yeah, OK, Magic Wormhole's handy too.

30:38.740 --> 30:39.900
Yeah, they're both good.

30:39.900 --> 30:42.500
But it's just, there is something really

30:42.500 --> 30:47.260
that sparks my fancy about this, because in my old IT days,

30:47.260 --> 30:51.060
I deployed a lot of thin clients and terminal services.

30:51.060 --> 30:54.880
I did Linux terminal services and Windows terminal services.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.940
And you could just use this to really kind of accomplish

30:57.940 --> 30:59.460
the same dang thing.

30:59.460 --> 31:01.080
I mean, I think if I was going to use it

31:01.080 --> 31:02.580
for a really extended period of time,

31:02.580 --> 31:05.420
there's a few modifications I might like to make to it.

31:05.420 --> 31:07.740
The whole thing right now is kind of based around the ABC

31:07.740 --> 31:08.940
user.

31:08.940 --> 31:10.660
And I think things get a little hairy

31:10.660 --> 31:11.700
if you want to change that.

31:11.700 --> 31:12.860
And I do not like that.

31:12.860 --> 31:15.020
So that's something I'd want to spelunk into a little bit.

31:15.020 --> 31:16.580
What are your thoughts on changing the username?

31:16.580 --> 31:18.980
Because it looks like by their docs, they don't recommend it.

31:18.980 --> 31:20.120
Yeah, they do mention that.

31:20.120 --> 31:21.380
But they do have some decent docs

31:21.380 --> 31:23.100
in here about for developers if you

31:23.100 --> 31:24.380
want to build your own image.

31:24.380 --> 31:27.780
So I think it's possible with a little consideration.

31:27.780 --> 31:30.940
It is, ABC is not the best username.

31:30.940 --> 31:33.540
And it would be nice to be able to customize this.

31:33.540 --> 31:37.100
I think maybe, too, we might want a version based on Arch,

31:37.100 --> 31:38.060
perhaps.

31:38.060 --> 31:40.220
Maybe that would be kind of cool.

31:40.220 --> 31:43.020
I could make 2004 work for a while, though.

31:43.020 --> 31:44.300
It's not the end of the world.

31:44.300 --> 31:47.020
As long as it's Plasma, that's the main thing.

31:47.020 --> 31:50.500
Really, the whole idea is to have this system that's

31:50.500 --> 31:53.620
running that you can reconnect to and disconnect.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.460
And it has all the tools up and ready to go.

31:55.460 --> 31:57.420
It's an always-on state.

31:57.420 --> 31:59.100
And we experimented with this.

31:59.100 --> 32:01.340
You can join and reattach to sessions

32:01.340 --> 32:04.020
and leave things running from different web browsers,

32:04.020 --> 32:05.900
from different IP addresses.

32:05.900 --> 32:07.940
It's all based around the user credentials.

32:07.940 --> 32:10.180
So that means that we can leave things.

32:10.180 --> 32:11.740
Wes could stage something for me.

32:11.740 --> 32:13.380
I could leave something staged for Wes.

32:13.380 --> 32:15.420
He can pop in and finish it.

32:15.420 --> 32:17.860
That kind of back-and-forth collaboration ability

32:17.860 --> 32:21.700
while we're remote and on the go and with limited connectivity,

32:21.700 --> 32:24.460
jeez, man, this is just going to be a lifesaver.

32:24.460 --> 32:26.780
It's not as flexible as something like shells.com

32:26.780 --> 32:29.540
that lets you run a whole bunch of different distros

32:29.540 --> 32:30.700
and all that kind of stuff.

32:30.700 --> 32:33.260
It's one distro, one desktop environment,

32:33.260 --> 32:34.840
really meant for one user.

32:34.840 --> 32:37.180
The way Wes and I are going to use it, it's really for two users.

32:37.180 --> 32:39.540
And it's not really meant for a whole suite of users

32:39.540 --> 32:40.780
and stuff like that.

32:40.780 --> 32:42.580
But if you need something for yourself,

32:42.580 --> 32:44.380
if you want a full desktop environment that

32:44.380 --> 32:48.420
runs in your web browser with really good support

32:48.420 --> 32:51.900
and pixel-perfect resolution rendering,

32:51.900 --> 32:56.220
if you resize your web browser, your desktop environment

32:56.220 --> 32:58.700
sees that as a screen resize and adjusts to accommodate it

32:58.700 --> 32:59.540
pretty quickly.

32:59.540 --> 33:00.740
Yeah, it really is impressive.

33:00.740 --> 33:02.620
And I've got to just have a lot of respect

33:02.620 --> 33:04.700
for the work, the folks behind this implementation.

33:04.700 --> 33:07.000
It's relying on a lot of different open-source software.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.420
But I think the Linux server folks

33:08.420 --> 33:11.060
have really done a good job of taking it to the next level

33:11.060 --> 33:13.620
and combining all of those pieces in a thoughtful way that

33:13.620 --> 33:15.420
just works really nicely.

33:15.420 --> 33:18.220
By default, one of the example compose files they have,

33:18.220 --> 33:20.340
it actually even mounts the Docker socket in there.

33:20.340 --> 33:22.660
Now, security-wise, you should be careful with this,

33:22.660 --> 33:23.180
of course.

33:23.180 --> 33:24.940
But if you're doing this in a controlled environment

33:24.940 --> 33:26.940
where you want to use this as an admin machine

33:26.940 --> 33:29.340
for the whole VM, now in your remote desktop,

33:29.340 --> 33:31.700
you can launch up other containers on that server.

33:31.700 --> 33:34.580
It's really cool the amount of possibilities that you have

33:34.580 --> 33:38.020
and sort of serverizes and deploys

33:38.020 --> 33:39.820
the power of the Linux desktop in a way that

33:39.820 --> 33:42.460
might be a lot more difficult with a proprietary desktop.

33:42.460 --> 33:45.780
But for us, it's just install Plasma in a Docker container.

33:45.780 --> 33:46.500
Go for it.

33:46.500 --> 33:47.140
Yep.

33:47.140 --> 33:48.700
Yeah, that's such a great point.

33:48.700 --> 33:50.900
ByteBit, and it sounds like you were thinking about doing this

33:50.900 --> 33:51.980
with a Raspberry Pi.

33:51.980 --> 33:55.500
Yeah, so I like working with a graphical user interface.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.620
But with the Raspberry Pi, you want

33:57.620 --> 34:00.620
to save as much resources as possible.

34:00.620 --> 34:04.140
So I install the headless version, install Docker,

34:04.140 --> 34:05.180
install WebTop.

34:05.180 --> 34:08.060
And when I need a desktop, I launch WebTop.

34:08.060 --> 34:10.420
When I'm done, I shut the container down

34:10.420 --> 34:12.140
and put it up when I need it.

34:12.140 --> 34:14.700
But I have the resources available to me

34:14.700 --> 34:16.460
without a full desktop.

34:16.460 --> 34:19.060
Yeah, and all of the packages it would

34:19.060 --> 34:21.500
require to be installed on the host system

34:21.500 --> 34:24.100
to support the desktop, even when you're not running it.

34:24.100 --> 34:24.700
Oh, good point.

34:24.700 --> 34:25.380
Yeah.

34:25.380 --> 34:26.980
Nice little optimization right there.

34:26.980 --> 34:29.220
Yeah, that's something I might want to try in the future.

34:29.220 --> 34:30.700
I think that's the part that's nice about this,

34:30.700 --> 34:32.580
is some of the extra flexibility, too.

34:32.580 --> 34:34.300
One of the things we were highlighting

34:34.300 --> 34:36.540
is running it on Linode, which is great because they

34:36.540 --> 34:37.860
have super fast bandwidth.

34:37.860 --> 34:40.620
And we can get fast processing and fast disk and connection

34:40.620 --> 34:41.820
wherever we need.

34:41.820 --> 34:43.140
But you might also want it, like you

34:43.140 --> 34:45.740
were mentioning, on a server somewhere that's super beefy

34:45.740 --> 34:48.300
or has local access to some data that you might need

34:48.300 --> 34:50.580
to run experiments on or to do analysis on

34:50.580 --> 34:52.740
or just to have a really powerful server

34:52.740 --> 34:54.300
to offload some rendering to.

34:54.300 --> 34:54.900
Yep, yep.

34:54.900 --> 34:57.220
And something else you and I were talking about off air

34:57.220 --> 34:59.700
for our use case, we have a system here

34:59.700 --> 35:02.500
in the studio that records our shows.

35:02.500 --> 35:06.020
And it also does tons of really great Jack audio routing

35:06.020 --> 35:09.340
for remote hosts and guests and the Mumble Room

35:09.340 --> 35:12.620
and brings it all together independently, digitally,

35:12.620 --> 35:15.380
into our specific tracks in Reaper for us.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.780
And it's just such an awesome machine.

35:17.780 --> 35:21.180
I hate to even touch it, but it is old.

35:21.180 --> 35:22.780
It's got eight gigs of RAM.

35:22.780 --> 35:26.940
It's got super old processors, old disks.

35:26.940 --> 35:29.180
It's in a bad way.

35:29.180 --> 35:31.700
And I do want to replace it, but I

35:31.700 --> 35:35.100
don't want to replace it with a $5,000 system, which

35:35.100 --> 35:38.460
is what we would need to get enough CPU cores and memory

35:38.460 --> 35:41.220
to do the rendering we want in a reasonable time.

35:41.220 --> 35:43.140
And so my thought was is perhaps this

35:43.140 --> 35:47.340
is an opportunity to offload this work to a server.

35:47.340 --> 35:50.820
We do the core recording on this machine.

35:50.820 --> 35:52.220
We stage everything.

35:52.220 --> 35:55.780
We export the project out, load it up in this web top instance

35:55.780 --> 35:58.260
up on Linode with a dedicated CPU machine,

35:58.260 --> 36:00.460
and then we just let it go to town for a while.

36:00.460 --> 36:03.540
And then we only have to deal with it just as a recorder.

36:03.540 --> 36:05.380
And it keeps our costs down.

36:05.380 --> 36:06.820
It keeps the noise of the machine

36:06.820 --> 36:08.300
down here in the studio.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.620
So that might be something we do,

36:09.620 --> 36:11.620
or I may end up now having to replace

36:11.620 --> 36:13.260
the server in the garage.

36:13.260 --> 36:14.820
And maybe there we go with something

36:14.820 --> 36:16.320
that has a lot of extra horsepower.

36:16.320 --> 36:20.020
And we offload some of the processing job using web top.

36:20.020 --> 36:22.180
We move the project file over.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.780
We log into web top, fire up Reaper,

36:24.780 --> 36:26.260
and begin rendering the project.

36:26.260 --> 36:29.060
And what's so neat too is you've got both sides of it

36:29.060 --> 36:32.300
in that if it's something you need to go in and futz with

36:32.300 --> 36:34.780
in the UI, you have a graphical UI.

36:34.780 --> 36:37.880
But in the same sense, it's just a Linux install.

36:37.880 --> 36:40.060
So you can have SSH in there if you need,

36:40.060 --> 36:41.800
or whatever back to our access to go in,

36:41.800 --> 36:44.620
kick off the script that way or with automation,

36:44.620 --> 36:46.020
and then check on it visually.

36:46.020 --> 36:49.740
Yep, and like everything the Linux server IO guys put out,

36:49.740 --> 36:51.920
it's really, really well done.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.140
The Docker compose file is easy to read.

36:54.140 --> 36:55.280
It's easy to understand.

36:55.280 --> 36:58.060
And then they have some great documentation

36:58.060 --> 36:59.340
that explains it all,

36:59.340 --> 37:00.700
that we will have linked in the show notes

37:00.700 --> 37:04.460
at linuxunplug.com slash 416.

37:04.460 --> 37:05.280
Go check it out.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.380
I think they've done a fantastic job.

37:07.380 --> 37:09.220
And I'd love to know other ways

37:09.220 --> 37:11.100
you particularly solve this problem.

37:11.100 --> 37:14.580
Let us know at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

37:14.580 --> 37:19.580
Linux.entropy.works, use promo code LUP13 and save 15%.

37:22.260 --> 37:23.740
This is a member of our community

37:23.740 --> 37:25.420
and I love watching them go.

37:25.420 --> 37:26.860
They're an industry leading mobile

37:26.860 --> 37:29.020
and web development studio based in the UK.

37:29.020 --> 37:30.220
And Entropy has global clients,

37:30.220 --> 37:32.180
including Mars Wrigley, Walmart, Mediacom,

37:32.180 --> 37:33.520
the Financial Times.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.420
They're trusted by some of the biggest names

37:35.420 --> 37:39.680
in media content, but it's not just about the big names.

37:39.680 --> 37:41.620
No, they wanna work with everybody.

37:41.620 --> 37:43.720
They love working with smaller companies, startups,

37:43.720 --> 37:45.420
people that are just getting into it.

37:45.420 --> 37:47.000
They just love building mobile desktop

37:47.000 --> 37:48.860
and web applications.

37:48.860 --> 37:50.140
And because they're on our show,

37:50.140 --> 37:51.360
probably not a huge surprise to you,

37:51.360 --> 37:52.740
but I love seeing this,

37:52.740 --> 37:54.880
Entropy runs on Linux.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.580
They are open source hounds.

37:56.580 --> 37:58.020
They have a team of distro hoppers

37:58.020 --> 37:58.900
and Linux hardware nerds

37:58.900 --> 38:01.140
and everything they do really goes back

38:01.140 --> 38:02.780
to their love for the Linux community.

38:02.780 --> 38:03.980
They're listeners of the show

38:03.980 --> 38:05.540
and they thought, you know what,

38:05.540 --> 38:08.100
like I preach often, let's spend locally.

38:08.100 --> 38:10.140
And I think that's a great way to go.

38:10.140 --> 38:12.460
And some of their key tools involve Ruby on Rails,

38:12.460 --> 38:14.900
of course, that's huge,

38:14.900 --> 38:16.940
but they're really moving into Flutter.

38:16.940 --> 38:18.580
Flutter for mobile and desktop

38:18.580 --> 38:20.900
and Flutter for the Linux desktop.

38:20.900 --> 38:22.300
They've pioneered some of the most complex

38:22.300 --> 38:23.260
Flutter apps ever built

38:23.260 --> 38:25.240
with full machine learning integration.

38:25.240 --> 38:27.420
They can rapidly build apps for iOS,

38:27.420 --> 38:29.660
Android, Windows, Mac OS, and yes,

38:31.100 --> 38:32.500
Linux, of course.

38:32.500 --> 38:34.800
In fact, they can pretty much do it in no time.

38:34.800 --> 38:35.640
That's how they've become

38:35.640 --> 38:37.100
one of the global leaders in Flutter development

38:37.100 --> 38:39.820
with dozens of deployments in the last year alone.

38:39.820 --> 38:41.280
So if you're thinking about taking the plunge

38:41.280 --> 38:42.780
into Flutter for the Linux desktop

38:42.780 --> 38:43.820
or maybe another platform,

38:43.820 --> 38:46.780
or maybe you're a small or large business,

38:46.780 --> 38:48.780
maybe you're just an independent dude

38:48.780 --> 38:51.500
or dudette trying to get into the app game,

38:51.500 --> 38:53.380
well, Entropy is always ready to chat.

38:53.380 --> 38:54.740
They'd love to discuss your ideas

38:54.740 --> 38:57.380
and give you some opinions, some thoughts, some input,

38:57.380 --> 38:59.540
regardless if you wanna move forward or not,

38:59.540 --> 39:00.980
they just love to chat.

39:00.980 --> 39:03.700
So get in touch, chat mobile, chat Flutter,

39:03.700 --> 39:05.500
or discuss your favorite Linux podcasts

39:05.500 --> 39:06.780
to help you get started

39:06.780 --> 39:09.500
and to help incentivize you a little bit.

39:09.500 --> 39:11.220
They're offering Linux Unplugged listeners

39:11.220 --> 39:13.560
15% off their first project.

39:13.560 --> 39:16.520
Mobile app, web app, maybe a Linux app.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.460
If I could vote, build a Linux app

39:18.460 --> 39:21.280
that makes recording PipeWire sources super easy

39:21.280 --> 39:22.340
and build it around Flutter.

39:22.340 --> 39:23.720
Go talk to Entropy about that.

39:23.720 --> 39:24.640
I'd buy it.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.360
So go to linux.entropy.works,

39:26.360 --> 39:29.660
fill out their contact form, use promo code LUP13,

39:29.660 --> 39:31.780
they'll get in touch, get you started.

39:31.780 --> 39:33.160
There's never any pressure.

39:33.160 --> 39:34.260
They're always happy just to chat

39:34.260 --> 39:36.460
and discuss your project and help any way they can.

39:36.460 --> 39:40.740
So that's linux.entropy.works and use promo code LUP13.

39:43.900 --> 39:45.660
Well, I think it's time for some feedback.

39:45.660 --> 39:46.660
What do you say, Chris?

39:46.660 --> 39:50.060
Indeed, Mr. Payne, you wanna read us Nicholas's email?

39:50.060 --> 39:52.660
Cause he's got something that,

39:52.660 --> 39:55.020
well, it's one of those elephants in the room.

39:55.020 --> 39:57.580
Hey guys, huge fan of the show.

39:57.580 --> 39:59.360
I've been waiting the last couple of episodes

39:59.360 --> 40:01.100
to hear what you think of this.

40:01.100 --> 40:03.620
It's a tablet built for Linux.

40:03.620 --> 40:04.900
Not sure if you've heard about it

40:04.900 --> 40:07.760
or maybe you've had some skepticism,

40:07.760 --> 40:11.860
but I hope you guys keep doing what you do either way.

40:11.860 --> 40:15.980
And he's talking about here, the JingOS tablet.

40:15.980 --> 40:18.900
Uh-huh, yeah, we haven't talked about this, have we?

40:18.900 --> 40:20.040
No, it's been out there.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.760
I mean, I think a lot of our audience out there

40:21.760 --> 40:23.240
has probably seen it on Twitter

40:23.240 --> 40:26.300
or been written about in some of the Linux news out there.

40:26.300 --> 40:28.100
Nicholas tries to sweeten the pot a bit,

40:28.100 --> 40:31.780
noting that the developer says it's not locked to JingOS,

40:31.780 --> 40:33.500
the actual hardware he means.

40:33.500 --> 40:34.660
You're supposed to be able to boot

40:34.660 --> 40:36.420
any ARM Linux on the device.

40:36.420 --> 40:39.420
Although of course, the hardware is coming with JingOS,

40:39.420 --> 40:42.580
which is designed for the tablet experience.

40:42.580 --> 40:45.700
I don't know though, the note about skepticism in here

40:45.700 --> 40:46.900
rang true for me.

40:46.900 --> 40:48.700
I mean, not just about Linux tablets,

40:48.700 --> 40:52.940
but kind of non-iPad tablets at all, if I'm honest.

40:52.940 --> 40:54.740
Yeah, that must be part of it.

40:54.740 --> 40:56.540
I know the reason why we haven't talked about it

40:56.540 --> 40:58.420
is because Wes and I are becoming

40:58.420 --> 41:01.260
so skeptical about all of these types of things.

41:01.260 --> 41:03.380
And this one seems particularly tricky

41:03.380 --> 41:06.340
because you've got the JingPad, which is a hardware device,

41:06.340 --> 41:07.760
and then you've got JingOS.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.940
And the ask here from the Jing folks

41:10.940 --> 41:13.960
is for us to believe that both of those things, the OS

41:13.960 --> 41:16.380
and the hardware, will be in some kind of production state

41:16.380 --> 41:18.820
that it's worth dropping $600 on.

41:18.820 --> 41:21.020
And it's a great price when you consider it $600

41:21.020 --> 41:23.540
and that includes the keyboard, which Apple charges like $300

41:23.540 --> 41:24.220
just for the keyboard.

41:24.220 --> 41:26.220
And then the tablet's like $1,000 on top of that.

41:26.220 --> 41:26.980
Right.

41:26.980 --> 41:27.780
But you're right.

41:27.780 --> 41:30.300
It's not only are we just skeptical of these kinds

41:30.300 --> 41:31.900
of devices now.

41:31.900 --> 41:33.580
I was on late night Linux this week,

41:33.580 --> 41:37.180
and we talked about grifters and open source and free software.

41:37.180 --> 41:41.780
And we've just seen so many grifters now

41:41.780 --> 41:44.900
that it is hard to believe anything's

41:44.900 --> 41:46.300
going to actually succeed.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.500
And so part of us just sits here and goes, well,

41:48.500 --> 41:49.820
when you ship, we'll believe you.

41:49.820 --> 41:50.940
Like the framework laptop.

41:50.940 --> 41:52.660
I think that same skepticism was applied

41:52.660 --> 41:53.700
to the framework laptop.

41:53.700 --> 41:54.460
Yeah, really.

41:54.460 --> 41:56.740
However, the downside to that is sometimes

41:56.740 --> 41:58.980
we miss cool things really early in the stage.

41:58.980 --> 42:01.340
It's like we've gotten old and bitter.

42:01.340 --> 42:02.500
We're missing the new stuff.

42:02.500 --> 42:04.180
We don't want to be that cynical, right?

42:04.180 --> 42:05.340
We should still have hope.

42:05.340 --> 42:06.380
I think that's essential.

42:06.380 --> 42:09.580
And we want to support projects that have a reasonable chance

42:09.580 --> 42:10.300
of working out.

42:10.300 --> 42:11.580
Right, right.

42:11.580 --> 42:15.660
However, I have seen some videos of the Jing Pad running Jing

42:15.660 --> 42:16.560
OS.

42:16.560 --> 42:20.900
And it's early days still, but it looks surprisingly good.

42:20.900 --> 42:23.340
To say it's been heavily inspired by iPad OS

42:23.340 --> 42:25.020
would be an understatement.

42:25.020 --> 42:26.820
But it has taken a lot of the elements

42:26.820 --> 42:29.340
that work well in iPad OS and applied them

42:29.340 --> 42:31.020
to a Linux environment.

42:31.020 --> 42:33.520
And this is once again offering that idea

42:33.520 --> 42:36.060
that you could have something that works in a tablet mode

42:36.060 --> 42:38.220
and also can be switched to a desktop mode

42:38.220 --> 42:39.460
for greater productivity.

42:39.460 --> 42:40.740
Convergence.

42:40.740 --> 42:41.660
Yeah, convergence.

42:41.660 --> 42:43.040
I've never heard that one before.

42:43.040 --> 42:46.180
And these kinds of things, they just check a skepticism box.

42:46.180 --> 42:48.820
So something that looks like iPad OS but isn't

42:48.820 --> 42:51.160
means that it's never going to quite be as good as the thing

42:51.160 --> 42:52.620
it's attempting to emulate.

42:52.620 --> 42:55.900
Something that offers convergence but so new

42:55.900 --> 42:59.220
and doesn't have super high-end hardware leaves me skeptical.

42:59.220 --> 43:01.100
I think you're hitting on it right there,

43:01.100 --> 43:04.140
is that it's not that they're not saying the right things.

43:04.140 --> 43:05.980
It's not that these aren't good goals.

43:05.980 --> 43:08.400
But we've seen so many folks have these goals.

43:08.400 --> 43:10.980
And then it's not even that they didn't get part of the way.

43:10.980 --> 43:13.340
But the claim and the competition on the market

43:13.340 --> 43:16.220
is executed on such a level and with the amount of polish

43:16.220 --> 43:18.060
that when you just sort of casually imply

43:18.060 --> 43:20.820
that's what you're building to, and then it doesn't hold up,

43:20.820 --> 43:23.500
you really start doubting, like, does our community even

43:23.500 --> 43:26.700
get why people like these other proprietary solutions?

43:26.700 --> 43:28.020
Yep, well said.

43:28.020 --> 43:32.100
Now, it seems conceivable, Wes, that as time goes on,

43:32.100 --> 43:34.380
technology improves, software projects

43:34.380 --> 43:38.180
continue to get iterated on, hardware gets better and better,

43:38.180 --> 43:40.660
display technology and CPUs in particular

43:40.660 --> 43:43.340
have just really just gotten better and better.

43:43.340 --> 43:45.660
I mean, maybe at some point, those things

43:45.660 --> 43:48.820
converge in a way that makes it possible for a promise

43:48.820 --> 43:50.340
like this to actually be met.

43:50.340 --> 43:53.100
And we'll be over here on the skepticism sidelines,

43:53.100 --> 43:54.940
thinking it's never going to happen.

43:54.940 --> 43:58.220
And we've missed this convergence of timing and hardware

43:58.220 --> 43:59.240
and software.

43:59.240 --> 44:00.820
And something great does come from it.

44:00.820 --> 44:04.220
But what we try to do is we try to talk about things

44:04.220 --> 44:08.180
on the show that we know are likely going to produce.

44:08.180 --> 44:09.980
And they're going to result in something.

44:09.980 --> 44:11.780
And if we talk about it and you go spend your money,

44:11.780 --> 44:13.380
you're not going to get scammed.

44:13.380 --> 44:16.860
Because I'm still waiting on my damn Atari VCS.

44:16.860 --> 44:19.580
And it was a lot of those types of things back in that era

44:19.580 --> 44:21.160
that just sort of burned me out on this.

44:21.160 --> 44:22.980
And now I want to see proof.

44:22.980 --> 44:24.220
I want to see a product.

44:24.220 --> 44:26.420
And I want to see it really starting to ship, at least

44:26.420 --> 44:29.260
to reviewers, before we really go in on it.

44:29.260 --> 44:31.860
But it's not to say we're not at least keeping our eye on it.

44:31.860 --> 44:35.020
And I do wonder if maybe we missed the boat on this.

44:35.020 --> 44:37.280
And maybe we should have talked about it earlier or not.

44:37.280 --> 44:39.240
But I still stand by that core principle of,

44:39.240 --> 44:41.240
I don't want the audience getting scammed.

44:41.240 --> 44:43.740
That's one area maybe where some of the Pine stuff

44:43.740 --> 44:45.300
has been a little more successful.

44:45.300 --> 44:47.500
Or at least, they've had an approach

44:47.500 --> 44:49.820
of not setting expectations too high.

44:49.820 --> 44:51.900
That's where it really gets dangerous to my mind.

44:51.900 --> 44:54.620
Right, is setting those expectations too high

44:54.620 --> 44:56.740
and then being unable to ever really achieve

44:56.740 --> 44:57.740
the initial promise.

44:57.740 --> 44:58.260
Yeah.

44:58.260 --> 44:59.220
Because I want us to play.

44:59.220 --> 45:00.380
I want us to try these things.

45:00.380 --> 45:02.020
But we just need to be honest if we're still

45:02.020 --> 45:03.420
working out a lot of the kinks.

45:03.420 --> 45:04.620
I like their progress.

45:04.620 --> 45:07.500
I'm happy to see this landing in reviewers' hands.

45:07.500 --> 45:10.900
And I think it's time to start taking it more seriously.

45:10.900 --> 45:13.060
And I may end up having to re-evaluate my stance

45:13.060 --> 45:14.500
on these types of projects.

45:14.500 --> 45:17.500
If both the framework laptop and the JingPad

45:17.500 --> 45:19.660
end up actually being really solid products that deliver

45:19.660 --> 45:21.340
on their promises, well, then that

45:21.340 --> 45:23.460
means it's time for Chris to reconsider this line

45:23.460 --> 45:26.220
and figure out where that line should lie, I suspect.

45:26.220 --> 45:27.100
Well, watch.

45:27.100 --> 45:29.860
I actually do really hope that I have reason

45:29.860 --> 45:33.860
to re-evaluate the skepticism that has brewed inside me.

45:33.860 --> 45:34.780
We'll see.

45:34.780 --> 45:36.620
Also, I'd like to make a call out on the podcast.

45:36.620 --> 45:39.340
We're looking to chat with someone at Bedrock Linux.

45:39.340 --> 45:42.820
Please email me, chris at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

45:42.820 --> 45:48.100
It's on our minds, and we'd like to chat with you.

45:48.100 --> 45:50.900
Well, like I mentioned, I was on Late Night Linux this week.

45:50.900 --> 45:52.940
Go check out Late Night Linux for that.

45:52.940 --> 45:56.800
We chatted about SyncThing, which my SyncThing install just

45:56.800 --> 45:59.020
recently hit the two-year mark.

45:59.020 --> 46:00.780
It's been running really solid.

46:00.780 --> 46:03.380
And the guys had me on to chat about that,

46:03.380 --> 46:05.020
grifters in the open source community,

46:05.020 --> 46:06.980
and a little fedora silver blue.

46:06.980 --> 46:09.860
So that was Late Night Linux episode 135,

46:09.860 --> 46:11.580
where I joined the boys.

46:11.580 --> 46:12.500
It was a good time.

46:12.500 --> 46:13.820
Go check that out.

46:13.820 --> 46:16.460
We'd love to have you join our Telegram group.

46:16.460 --> 46:19.260
I posted the most adorable picture of Levi

46:19.260 --> 46:20.180
in there this morning.

46:20.180 --> 46:21.540
I don't do it often.

46:21.540 --> 46:23.460
But every now and then, the really good ones,

46:23.460 --> 46:25.340
I drop them in there at jupiterbroadcasting.com

46:25.340 --> 46:26.640
slash Telegram.

46:26.640 --> 46:29.020
And if you join while this podcast is out,

46:29.020 --> 46:31.100
it's probably not too far back in there.

46:31.100 --> 46:33.180
Or you could just look at all the photos, I suppose.

46:33.180 --> 46:33.900
You can do that.

46:33.900 --> 46:36.180
So jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

46:36.180 --> 46:39.100
And maybe as a bonus, there's a little bit of Linux chat

46:39.100 --> 46:41.580
sometimes, but mostly dog pics.

46:41.580 --> 46:44.100
That's not, it's mostly Linux chat.

46:44.100 --> 46:46.660
It is, but I mean, you saw the picture.

46:46.660 --> 46:47.820
It's very cute.

46:47.820 --> 46:49.140
It was adorable.

46:49.140 --> 46:51.020
Meetup.com slash jupiterbroadcasting,

46:51.020 --> 46:53.020
and last but not least, we'd love to hear from you.

46:53.020 --> 46:55.060
Linuxunplug.com slash contact.

46:55.060 --> 46:57.260
That goes into an inbox that both Wes and I can check

46:57.260 --> 46:59.700
and read, and we try to read every single one of them.

46:59.700 --> 47:01.380
Even if we don't respond, and they don't all

47:01.380 --> 47:04.940
make it into the show, we try to read every email every week.

47:04.940 --> 47:07.300
That's linuxunplug.com slash contact.

47:07.300 --> 47:09.060
I imagine I'll be worse at that practice

47:09.060 --> 47:10.880
while I'm on the road, but when I get back,

47:10.880 --> 47:12.220
I'll try to get that back in.

47:12.220 --> 47:14.080
It's something I, it's a goal of mine recently

47:14.080 --> 47:16.780
because I ask you to send the email in.

47:16.780 --> 47:18.080
The least I could do is read it.

47:18.080 --> 47:20.180
So it is actually a personal goal of mine

47:20.180 --> 47:22.480
to read each one of them that comes in.

47:22.480 --> 47:24.160
It may be a little sketchy while I'm on the road,

47:24.160 --> 47:25.180
but we do try.

47:25.180 --> 47:26.820
And last but absolutely not least, actually,

47:26.820 --> 47:28.340
I need to mention the Luplug.

47:28.340 --> 47:30.500
They get together every Sunday noon Pacific

47:30.500 --> 47:33.300
in our Mumble Room at linuxunplug.com slash Mumble.

47:33.300 --> 47:35.660
You can get the details, and then you join,

47:35.660 --> 47:36.500
and you're good to go.

47:36.500 --> 47:38.740
You hang out and chat with some like-minded folks.

47:38.740 --> 47:41.500
Get the info, linuxunplug.com slash Mumble.

47:43.500 --> 47:47.420
When we were fooling around with our cloud Linux desktop,

47:47.420 --> 47:51.020
you came across a pretty neat trick.

47:51.020 --> 47:55.180
Yeah, this is by a gentleman named Scotty Hardy on GitHub.

47:55.180 --> 47:58.480
It's called Docker Wine, and it's a Docker image

47:58.480 --> 48:01.260
that includes wine and wine tricks.

48:01.260 --> 48:03.240
But not only that, it's pre-configured

48:03.240 --> 48:05.020
with a handy little helper script

48:05.020 --> 48:07.660
that's ready to set things up locally with X11 forwarding.

48:07.660 --> 48:10.300
If you've got an X server running and just wanna run the app

48:10.300 --> 48:14.180
in the container, or it's got RDP built in

48:14.180 --> 48:16.540
if you wanna run this wine app on a remote server.

48:16.540 --> 48:19.980
Which means it also supports audio redirection.

48:19.980 --> 48:22.860
It'll play sounds through Pulse Audio on your Linux box

48:22.860 --> 48:24.080
using this whole setup.

48:24.080 --> 48:26.620
So Windows applications in a container

48:26.620 --> 48:30.060
that you're connecting to over RDP with sound support.

48:30.060 --> 48:32.480
And the name is cleverly Docker Wine.

48:32.480 --> 48:34.980
We'll have a link to this in the show notes.

48:34.980 --> 48:35.820
This is great.

48:35.820 --> 48:38.340
This is so neat because you sometimes need to crap up

48:38.340 --> 48:40.820
your system to get all of this wine stuff working.

48:40.820 --> 48:42.940
Yeah, no one wants to install all these weird,

48:42.940 --> 48:44.580
janky Windows programs, right?

48:44.580 --> 48:46.900
That's the perfect use case for a container.

48:46.900 --> 48:47.740
It really is.

48:47.740 --> 48:49.580
Like, just go crap up a container,

48:49.580 --> 48:51.820
and then when you're done with it, you throw it away.

48:51.820 --> 48:53.300
And what's so nice about this project

48:53.300 --> 48:55.620
is that as somebody who does weird things

48:55.620 --> 48:56.780
with containers and plates with it,

48:56.780 --> 48:59.220
there can be some arcane tricks between user permissions,

48:59.220 --> 49:02.300
between mounting all the right Pulse and X11 stuff,

49:02.300 --> 49:04.780
let alone configuring the RDP connection to be easy.

49:04.780 --> 49:07.580
So it's just nice that a lot of that knowledge and trickery

49:07.580 --> 49:10.020
is distilled in one handy little script you can run.

49:10.020 --> 49:11.580
Well, I'm gonna check on the server.

49:11.580 --> 49:13.180
It looks like it's still up, Wes.

49:13.180 --> 49:15.700
Huh, I wonder why it would have crashed so soon

49:15.700 --> 49:18.060
after last time, and this time it's remained up.

49:18.060 --> 49:19.180
What's the difference, right?

49:19.180 --> 49:20.860
Something tells me we're gonna stop pinging it

49:20.860 --> 49:22.540
and stop paying attention to it after the show,

49:22.540 --> 49:23.940
and then it's gonna crash immediately.

49:23.940 --> 49:26.060
Oh boy, we gotta get this fixed.

49:26.060 --> 49:29.420
This is gonna, I think job one really is while it's up,

49:29.420 --> 49:31.780
offload as much config as I can, right?

49:31.780 --> 49:32.820
That's job one.

49:32.820 --> 49:35.260
Because the data's okay, I would rather honestly

49:35.260 --> 49:37.580
have some hardware component on the motherboard

49:37.580 --> 49:39.820
or the CPU fail than any of the disks fail.

49:39.820 --> 49:41.980
Even though we've got them in a ZFS RAID,

49:41.980 --> 49:43.780
at least all of the disks are fine.

49:43.780 --> 49:45.300
We can ultimately move those.

49:45.300 --> 49:47.660
Time to check our backups.

49:47.660 --> 49:48.660
No kidding.

49:48.660 --> 49:50.500
In the meantime, go follow the show on Twitter

49:50.500 --> 49:53.140
for news announcements or schedule changes,

49:53.140 --> 49:54.540
which I don't expect there will be,

49:54.540 --> 49:55.820
or other kinds of things like that.

49:55.820 --> 49:58.860
At Linux Unplugged, the whole network is at Jupiter Signal

49:58.860 --> 50:01.660
because yes, there are an entire network,

50:01.660 --> 50:05.740
a fantastic podcast, including the self-hosted podcasts,

50:05.740 --> 50:09.100
Encoder Radio, and of course, the companion to this show,

50:09.100 --> 50:11.020
Linux Action News, every Monday morning,

50:11.020 --> 50:13.220
Wes and I break down everything that mattered

50:13.220 --> 50:16.020
in the week of Linux and open source.

50:16.020 --> 50:17.380
And you gotta catch that.

50:17.380 --> 50:19.260
If you're not catching Linux Action News,

50:19.260 --> 50:21.500
you're like missing half of this show practically,

50:21.500 --> 50:23.060
but it's just the news segment,

50:23.060 --> 50:24.700
just the news you need to know.

50:24.700 --> 50:26.140
It's great too if you're in the industry.

50:26.140 --> 50:28.180
In fact, if you know anybody in the industry

50:28.180 --> 50:29.940
that should stay up to date on this stuff

50:29.940 --> 50:31.940
as part of their job, send them a link

50:31.940 --> 50:33.900
to your favorite episode of Linux Action News.

50:33.900 --> 50:37.180
It's a great way for people in the industry to stay informed.

50:37.180 --> 50:41.780
As for us, one more show in the studio before we head out.

50:41.780 --> 50:44.900
It's literally the last thing I do before I hit the road.

50:44.900 --> 50:46.660
So join us for that.

50:46.660 --> 50:48.580
It'll be the last Linux Unplugged from the studio

50:48.580 --> 50:53.220
for a while next Tuesday at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

50:53.220 --> 50:54.500
See you next week.

50:54.500 --> 50:57.140
Same bat time, same bat station.

50:57.140 --> 51:00.380
Indeed, links to everything we talked about today,

51:00.380 --> 51:03.780
how to contact, how to join the Mumble Room,

51:03.780 --> 51:05.700
the matrix server, all of it.

51:05.700 --> 51:08.140
What we've done is put it all together

51:08.140 --> 51:11.460
on a webpage at linuxunplugged.com.

51:11.460 --> 51:13.140
I'd like you to check it out.

51:13.140 --> 51:14.540
Also there, you'll find links to everything

51:14.540 --> 51:16.340
we've talked about for previous episodes,

51:16.340 --> 51:18.100
the entire bat catalog.

51:18.100 --> 51:19.180
It's incredible.

51:19.180 --> 51:21.500
We're still working on a Gopher version though.

51:21.500 --> 51:22.340
It'll happen.

51:22.340 --> 51:24.220
And maybe a Usenet version as well.

51:24.220 --> 51:25.640
Great way to download the show.

51:25.640 --> 51:27.440
Anyways, as for us, thanks for joining us

51:27.440 --> 51:28.620
on this week's episode.

51:28.620 --> 51:30.420
We'll see you back here next Tuesday!

51:32.780 --> 51:33.620
Right!

51:33.620 --> 52:02.740
And we'll see you next week.

52:02.740 --> 52:11.380
Alright, go vote JBtitles.com.

52:11.380 --> 52:12.980
We got through it.

52:12.980 --> 52:14.260
It was rough.

52:14.260 --> 52:17.460
I am off my game, you know, because I was already getting a little rough.

52:17.460 --> 52:21.660
One of my data plans just got canceled on me, which has kind of sent me into a panic

52:21.660 --> 52:23.100
about the road trip.

52:23.100 --> 52:25.460
And then to have this server failure happening right now.

52:25.460 --> 52:36.580
I think you're a one-legged stool right now.
