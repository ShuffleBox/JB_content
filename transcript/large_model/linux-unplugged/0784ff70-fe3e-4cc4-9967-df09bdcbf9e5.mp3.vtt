WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
Now, Wes, before we start, I gotta let people know, next week, we're having a schedule change.

00:06.880 --> 00:08.440
Just for one week, because we're making room for OSCON.

00:08.440 --> 00:09.440
You know about OSCON?

00:09.440 --> 00:10.440
That's a big deal.

00:10.440 --> 00:11.440
Yeah.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.440
We're going to be at OSCON on July 22nd, which is a Wednesday.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.760
You can go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting if you want to join us.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.680
We're going to meet up and we're going to be at OSCON itself.

00:18.680 --> 00:21.240
If you're going to be on the floor, you're welcome to come up and say hi to Noah and

00:21.240 --> 00:25.000
I or go out to dinner with us afterwards, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
To make room for that, we're going to have to leave on Tuesday, though, which means unplugged

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
on Monday next week.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Woo!

00:31.000 --> 00:33.360
Yeah, same bat time, just a different bat day.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.040
Does that make sense?

00:35.040 --> 00:36.040
I think so.

00:36.040 --> 00:37.040
Is that a thing people say?

00:37.040 --> 00:38.040
Let's just pretend that it does.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.040
And a bat channel, too.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.040
Yeah, exactly.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.360
Yeah, so we're going to do it Monday at 2 p.m. Pacific, but you go to JupiterBroadcasting.com

00:41.360 --> 00:42.360
slash calendar.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.360
And I want to put this right here at the top, because we love having you guys join us live

00:45.360 --> 00:47.160
in our virtual lug.

00:47.160 --> 00:50.960
So join us live next week, Monday at 2 p.m. Pacific, JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar,

00:50.960 --> 00:52.600
and come say hi to us at OSCON.

00:52.600 --> 00:56.800
And remember, you can also use the promo code LINUX to get a 20% discount off of your OSCON

00:56.800 --> 00:57.800
pass if you'd like.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.480
If you want to come down and say hi to us, I think the base pass is like 50 bucks, and

01:00.480 --> 01:01.480
you get 20% off that.

01:01.480 --> 01:02.480
It's not bad to come say hi.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.480
What a deal.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.840
And you get to say hi to all the vendors and all that kind of – it's a great pass.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.440
The expo pass is a great one to go.

01:07.440 --> 01:11.060
So that'll be next Monday at 2 p.m. Pacific, JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:11.060 --> 01:12.060
Join us live at jblive.tv.

01:12.060 --> 01:15.880
And I would be up for the VR debate, because I'm back on board.

01:15.880 --> 01:16.880
I'm back on the VR train.

01:16.880 --> 01:17.880
I'm back on!

01:17.880 --> 01:20.880
I got off the hype train for a little bit, and I'm back on.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.920
So we've just recorded two episodes of the Ubuntu podcast.

01:23.920 --> 01:24.920
Yeah.

01:24.920 --> 01:29.440
Apparently, Popey's on holiday, but we've just done a segment on Google Cardboard.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.440
Yeah.

01:30.440 --> 01:31.440
And?

01:31.440 --> 01:32.440
And?

01:32.440 --> 01:33.440
Yes.

01:33.440 --> 01:34.440
I think I'm going to get one, just to try it out.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.680
I think it's a low enough barrier to entry that it's interesting.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.680
I think – you know what, Pope?

01:37.680 --> 01:38.680
I wimpy.

01:38.680 --> 01:39.680
I wimpy.

01:39.680 --> 01:40.680
I'm sorry.

01:40.680 --> 01:41.680
I think you should wimpy, because – and here's why.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.800
I'm going to get – I'm going to get junk – people are going to call and tell me I'm

01:44.800 --> 01:45.800
a – no.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.800
No.

01:46.800 --> 01:47.800
Here's what I think you should do.

01:47.800 --> 01:54.640
I think Cardboard is the best solution, because – so having tried the Oculus DK2, right?

01:54.640 --> 01:59.340
And having tried that hooked up to the PC, I will say it is very, very clunky.

01:59.340 --> 02:01.720
It is not production-ready.

02:01.720 --> 02:06.600
But if you scale it down and you go with something like the Samsung VR Innovation Edition or

02:06.600 --> 02:11.640
the Google Cardboard, it is not as dramatic of an experience, it is not as necessarily

02:11.640 --> 02:17.760
as high-powered, but it is so simple and straightforward, and there's already a bunch of good stuff

02:17.760 --> 02:19.320
in the Play Store.

02:19.320 --> 02:23.920
And in the case of the Samsung VR Innovator Edition, there's an entire Oculus app store

02:23.920 --> 02:27.800
filled full of stuff that you can try that is legit.

02:27.800 --> 02:34.920
And in the case of the S6 Innovator Edition, because the screen on the S6 is like 544 ppi,

02:34.920 --> 02:37.800
it actually has a higher resolution than the Oculus.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.740
So you can actually get smartphones that have a higher resolution now than the Oculus and

02:40.740 --> 02:42.200
Google Cardboard too.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.200
Yeah.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.200
Yeah.

02:44.200 --> 02:48.180
And it's a low – like you say, it's low cost, so it's almost zero risk.

02:48.180 --> 02:53.900
So Mark, who was discussing Google Cardboard, he bought, you know, the cheapest cardboard

02:53.900 --> 02:59.800
version he could find for four quid, and he tried it out, and from that he's decided

02:59.800 --> 03:03.520
actually it's quite good and it's good enough and there's enough content that he'll

03:03.520 --> 03:09.280
probably buy a slightly better headset to, you know, use more frequently.

03:09.280 --> 03:12.040
He's more into games than I am.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.040
Well, you know –

03:13.040 --> 03:16.240
Mark's case is a little bit more disturbing, but just as much fun, I think.

03:16.240 --> 03:17.240
What is it?

03:17.240 --> 03:23.720
Well, so, you know, if you get a new cat, you know, eventually you decide to buy them

03:23.720 --> 03:28.280
catnip and you all sit in a circle and give the cat catnip and then, you know, all enjoy

03:28.280 --> 03:30.560
the cat wigging out on catnip for the first time.

03:30.560 --> 03:31.560
No, I've never done that.

03:31.560 --> 03:32.560
No, no, of course.

03:32.560 --> 03:37.360
I'm just wondering, you know, what would Google Cardboard do to four and five year

03:37.360 --> 03:38.360
old girls?

03:38.360 --> 03:40.400
I'm kind of interested to see what it does to children.

03:40.400 --> 03:49.360
You know, I put Dylan in the DK2 and almost a year ago and about two weeks ago he brought

03:49.360 --> 03:53.920
it up to me and he said, Dad, can I do that – can I wear that headset again and ride

03:53.920 --> 03:55.520
that roller coaster again?

03:55.520 --> 04:01.360
And I haven't talked to him about it in that entire time and now he's six and it left

04:01.360 --> 04:04.480
enough of an impression on him that he brought it up on his own to me.

04:04.480 --> 04:08.360
And so our conversation that Wimpy, you and I have had, and Popey has been involved in

04:08.360 --> 04:14.280
too about VR in the pre-show here, and then Dylan's sort of, like it really made an impression

04:14.280 --> 04:20.480
on him and it made an impression on me, I decided I wanted to revisit the VR topic and

04:20.480 --> 04:25.040
not maybe – because after Oculus abandoned Linux I kind of was like, I'm done, screw

04:25.040 --> 04:27.000
these guys, right?

04:27.000 --> 04:33.760
But you know, I did end up with a Galaxy S6 and the thing is, is once you have the Galaxy

04:33.760 --> 04:39.920
S6, you basically have the most expensive component to getting the Galaxy VR set up.

04:39.920 --> 04:44.040
Because once you have the phone, it's basically, you just need the headset.

04:44.040 --> 04:48.820
So yesterday I received the Galaxy VR Innovator Edition headset.

04:48.820 --> 04:49.820
And it's pretty, guys.

04:49.820 --> 04:53.200
Yeah, and Wes has had a chance to play with it too, and there's some things that are

04:53.200 --> 04:57.040
awkward about it, like you have to have your phone on and unlocked before you put it in,

04:57.040 --> 05:01.920
but once you do that, it has a USB port built into it, the mini USB port that the phone

05:01.920 --> 05:08.960
clicks into and then it snaps in and now it's in virtual reality mode and it has a light

05:08.960 --> 05:13.640
sensor in the headset so it detects when I have the headset on and right now I'm in

05:13.640 --> 05:21.760
a Samsung Gear VR theater room where I have an Oculus library in front of me of different

05:21.760 --> 05:25.120
games that are built on the Oculus platform that I can pull from.

05:25.120 --> 05:30.800
I also have movies that I can watch and what's truly, truly, truly amazing and thrilling

05:30.800 --> 05:38.800
is what I expected to be really fascinating about this was the gaming and the tourism

05:38.800 --> 05:39.800
element of it.

05:39.800 --> 05:44.840
They have amazing photos, like there's a tour of London and a tour of Paris and they have,

05:44.840 --> 05:48.960
of course, they have space travel, which is virtual, but Wes, as you saw, it's very impressive.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.960
Oh yeah, definitely.

05:50.960 --> 05:58.080
So I'd be interested to hear more from Wes, given that you're in the studio and you can

05:58.080 --> 06:01.000
actually see this thing and you're an impartial observer.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
You can play with it and it might be hard with the headphones, but yeah, so Wes, you

06:04.000 --> 06:10.240
got to, let's see, you did the, and it does work a lot better if you have headphones,

06:10.240 --> 06:13.720
so Wes is going to have to kind of compromise on that for this part of it, but what was

06:13.720 --> 06:14.720
your impressions of it?

06:14.720 --> 06:18.340
Actually, I was very impressed, you know, it's sturdily made, clearly they had at least

06:18.340 --> 06:21.720
one industrial designer on this thing, it's like, you know, kind of the opposite of the

06:21.720 --> 06:25.720
cardboard in that respect, lightweight and...

06:25.720 --> 06:27.280
It does feel really well built, huh?

06:27.280 --> 06:28.280
It does feel really well built.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.280
Yeah.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.280
You know, it's solid, it fits well.

06:30.280 --> 06:33.320
It's interesting, it's got a touch pad built into the side of it, it's got an Android back

06:33.320 --> 06:36.720
button and then on the other side, it's got a tiny little fan that you don't really hear.

06:36.720 --> 06:37.880
No, I didn't hear it at all.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.560
What did you think of the graphics?

06:39.560 --> 06:46.160
You know, it was, there were a little blurry at times, but a little screen door effect

06:46.160 --> 06:47.160
at times.

06:47.160 --> 06:50.560
A little screen door effect, but otherwise, it was very smooth, it was very engaging,

06:50.560 --> 06:54.640
you know, it fits really well on your head and so just being able to look around and,

06:54.640 --> 06:57.920
you know, we were sitting in the restaurant having probably a million people gawk at us,

06:57.920 --> 06:58.920
but...

06:58.920 --> 06:59.920
Yeah, yeah, we did it.

06:59.920 --> 07:00.920
Yeah.

07:00.920 --> 07:01.920
I really had no idea, you know, I could have been anywhere.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.120
That's how geeky we are, you guys, is at the restaurant.

07:04.120 --> 07:07.160
I was at the restaurant, I had Wes try it out.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.880
Now, Wes, I want you to try something that you didn't get a chance to try out yet, and

07:09.880 --> 07:15.440
this is truly one of the most incredible experiences I ever had for virtual reality.

07:15.440 --> 07:19.360
This is going to put you on stage during a Coldplay conference, and I don't know if you're

07:19.360 --> 07:23.480
a Coldplay fan, and this is going to be a little hard for you to see, but they have

07:23.480 --> 07:28.920
a 360 degree camera, yeah, so now what do you think of that?

07:28.920 --> 07:29.920
Oh, wow.

07:29.920 --> 07:36.800
Now, you can look all around, and I want you to go until they launch the paper on the stage.

07:36.800 --> 07:37.800
Isn't that amazing?

07:37.800 --> 07:39.800
Look at him dancing there, and you see all the different bands playing.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.480
Oh, yeah, you know, the resolution's really not bad.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.400
Yeah, for real video, it's quite good.

07:44.400 --> 07:48.160
Yeah, smooth, very little blur.

07:48.160 --> 07:55.800
It's not surprising that the two largest install bases so far are Cardboard and Gear VR, experience

07:55.800 --> 07:56.800
oriented.

07:56.800 --> 07:57.800
Yeah.

07:57.800 --> 08:01.600
You can look around and see all the people dancing in the crowd, and yeah, isn't that

08:01.600 --> 08:02.600
a...

08:02.600 --> 08:03.600
Sounds pretty cool, except for the Coldplay part.

08:03.600 --> 08:08.560
Yeah, the Coldplay part's a bit rough, but it's a pretty neat experience to see these

08:08.560 --> 08:12.000
guys and, you know, to see them dance right in front of you, you can even see his man

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
boobs jiggle.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
Yeah, it's very much that.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Yeah.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Oh, wow, yeah, here comes the paper.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Yeah, isn't that neat?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Oh, wow, yeah.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
That's really something.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
It kind of surprises you, honestly.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
That's awesome.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.920
Yeah, and so what's great about it is in theater mode, you get a full 3D experience.

08:25.920 --> 08:30.780
It's better than any kind of movie theater experience, because it's truly, you know,

08:30.780 --> 08:32.400
you're truly immersed in the whole thing.

08:32.400 --> 08:33.400
Here, let me...

08:33.400 --> 08:34.400
Honestly, I would rather watch things on a TV.

08:34.400 --> 08:35.400
Hold on, I'll turn your mic on.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.400
Sorry.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.400
There you go.

08:37.400 --> 08:38.400
Say again, Wes?

08:38.400 --> 08:40.960
I would probably rather watch some things on that than on a TV.

08:40.960 --> 08:41.960
It's way more engaging.

08:41.960 --> 08:45.860
I watched some movies last night on this, and it is, and you know, if you want to watch

08:45.860 --> 08:48.960
something 3D, screw a 3D television.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.200
This is where it's at.

08:50.200 --> 08:51.200
And way less of an investment.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.760
Well, if you have an S6.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.560
It runs off the power of the phone, which is good and bad, because it does drain the

08:55.560 --> 08:58.960
phone, but it means that all you have to do is take the phone and this, and if you're

08:58.960 --> 09:04.800
going on an airplane for traveling or a train, this would be, yeah, it's a theater wherever

09:04.800 --> 09:05.800
you go.

09:05.800 --> 09:06.800
So what do you think, Wimpy?

09:06.800 --> 09:07.800
Are you impressed?

09:07.800 --> 09:08.800
Can you charge...

09:08.800 --> 09:09.800
I'm interested.

09:09.800 --> 09:10.800
I don't know if I'm impressed yet.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.760
I've got some more questions for you.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.560
Can you plug a, you know, an external charger into the phone whilst using it?

09:16.560 --> 09:17.560
Yes.

09:17.560 --> 09:21.000
There's a little mini USB port on the bottom of the VR that you could plug in, and that

09:21.000 --> 09:23.080
would supply power to the phone, too.

09:23.080 --> 09:27.760
So if you were doing your train journey or your flight, you could power the thing as

09:27.760 --> 09:28.760
your phone case.

09:28.760 --> 09:32.320
Yeah, or maybe even just run it off like a portable battery.

09:32.320 --> 09:37.800
And for those of us that have not seen these, is this the shutter effect 3D, or is it polarized

09:37.800 --> 09:39.880
glass effect?

09:39.880 --> 09:42.440
I don't know if it's either, to be honest.

09:42.440 --> 09:43.440
I don't know.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.440
That's a good question.

09:44.440 --> 09:45.440
Yeah, I don't know exactly how they do it.

09:45.440 --> 09:46.640
It may be a shutter effect.

09:46.640 --> 09:51.940
So you know, what's happening on a technical level is the galaxy screen goes into like

09:51.940 --> 09:58.000
a stereo optical mode, and then there's lenses in the VR that tune those in.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.880
And I don't know how it does it, but it is a very immersive 3D experience, you know.

10:02.880 --> 10:03.880
It's full...

10:03.880 --> 10:07.840
So is it half the screen for one eye and half the screen for the other eye, effectively,

10:07.840 --> 10:09.840
that then the lens filters?

10:09.840 --> 10:11.000
I don't know.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.800
I don't actually think that is the case.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.160
I don't think so, but I don't know how it works well enough.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.000
The fact that you don't know bodes well.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.760
Yeah, and I think part of it is the screen resolution is so high to begin with, right,

10:21.760 --> 10:23.320
that it's way higher than...

10:23.320 --> 10:24.320
It's like a...

10:24.320 --> 10:27.760
I forget what it is off the top of my head, but even if you had to bring it down, it would

10:27.760 --> 10:30.280
still be probably higher than 1080p.

10:30.280 --> 10:34.480
Both Cardboard and Gear VR do have a divider, so it must be splitting the screen in half.

10:34.480 --> 10:38.000
Yeah, every now and then when I pull the phone out, I've seen it like in sort of like stereo

10:38.000 --> 10:42.360
optical mode, and it's kind of funny looking on screen and the screen snaps out of it.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.960
And you know, if you run it for about 45 minutes to an hour, it'll start to say, oh, it's too

10:45.960 --> 10:47.240
hot depending on what you've been doing.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.840
Take the phone out for a while, and you gotta take the phone out.

10:49.840 --> 10:50.840
So you need two.

10:50.840 --> 10:51.840
Yeah.

10:51.840 --> 10:53.280
Swap them into two.

10:53.280 --> 11:09.760
This is Linux Unplugged episode 101 for July 14, 2015.

11:09.760 --> 11:14.160
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that just finished a virtual tour

11:14.160 --> 11:15.160
of the solar system.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.220
And man, Jupiter was beautiful.

11:17.220 --> 11:19.720
My name is Chris, and joining me in studio, Wes is back.

11:19.720 --> 11:20.720
Hey, Wes.

11:20.720 --> 11:21.720
Hey, guys.

11:21.720 --> 11:22.720
Hey, how you doing, buddy?

11:22.720 --> 11:23.720
How you having me?

11:23.720 --> 11:24.720
Good.

11:24.720 --> 11:25.720
Good.

11:25.720 --> 11:26.720
You don't have food coma, right?

11:26.720 --> 11:27.720
Oh, no.

11:27.720 --> 11:28.720
I'm good.

11:28.720 --> 11:29.720
The beer's helping a lot.

11:29.720 --> 11:30.720
Yeah, the beer helps, right?

11:30.720 --> 11:31.720
It's like, it's the opposite of caffeine, but for some reason it wakes you up.

11:31.720 --> 11:32.720
I don't know how that works.

11:32.720 --> 11:33.720
We'll just keep telling ourselves that.

11:33.720 --> 11:34.720
Well, I don't know about that.

11:34.720 --> 11:38.720
But coming up on today's episode of Linux Unplugged, I'll tell you what I do know about.

11:38.720 --> 11:43.880
There is some big news happening in one of our most beloved things to hate.

11:43.880 --> 11:44.880
That's Flash.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.440
We're gonna talk about the big changes coming to Flash and how it's gonna affect Linux users.

11:47.440 --> 11:53.240
Coming up in the show, a really, really, really well-done write-up about a KDE user who spent

11:53.240 --> 11:58.560
a week in Gnome, and he was able to put his thoughts in a way that really resonated with

11:58.560 --> 11:59.760
me and a lot of people in the audience.

11:59.760 --> 12:03.720
I'm getting a lot of feedback on this write-up, and I want to talk about it today with our

12:03.720 --> 12:04.940
virtual lug.

12:04.940 --> 12:09.480
And then after that, OpenSUSE, so we've talked about it a little bit on the Linux Action

12:09.480 --> 12:12.760
Show, we've talked about it a little bit on this show, OpenSUSE 42.

12:12.760 --> 12:16.840
It's a big new proposal, big dreams, a lot of changes coming.

12:16.840 --> 12:22.200
The success of Tumbleweed has made OpenSUSE re-evaluate the OpenSUSE project, and we covered

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
that on Sunday's show.

12:23.200 --> 12:28.600
But I think maybe some people didn't like our opinion or have a different opinion.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.480
We're gonna cover that feedback and discuss the nuances there, and I think it's gonna

12:31.480 --> 12:33.600
be a really, really fascinating discussion.

12:33.600 --> 12:37.760
But Wes, before we get to all of that, we actually have some really great emails we're

12:37.760 --> 12:41.120
gonna read this week, since in 100 we didn't read any feedback.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.240
So let's get into all of this.

12:42.240 --> 12:43.800
Let's invite in the virtual lug.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.080
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

12:46.080 --> 12:47.080
Hello.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.080
Hello.

12:48.080 --> 12:49.080
Hello.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.080
Hello.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.080
Good morning.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.080
Good afternoon.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.080
And it's the evening.

12:53.080 --> 12:57.120
So, guys, we have so much to cover today, and maybe it's the beer, maybe it's because

12:57.120 --> 12:59.520
we just started the show, but it's starting to get warm in here.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.520
Oh, yeah.

13:00.520 --> 13:01.520
Yeah.

13:01.520 --> 13:02.520
Okay.

13:02.520 --> 13:03.520
Roasty toast.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.520
You know I'm not making it up, either.

13:04.520 --> 13:05.520
It is warm in here.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.640
It's nice to have somebody who validates it like, yeah, Chris is not making it up.

13:07.640 --> 13:08.640
All right.

13:08.640 --> 13:09.640
Earl writes in, and I love this.

13:09.640 --> 13:12.440
Do you guys remember the conversation we had around Linux Mint?

13:12.440 --> 13:15.880
Last week we had the review, and the week before that we had a conversation, is it too

13:15.880 --> 13:17.280
boring for us Linux users?

13:17.280 --> 13:21.040
Is Mint going the direction that maybe long-term is going to kind of leave it behind?

13:21.040 --> 13:22.960
Or is that exactly the sweet spot?

13:22.960 --> 13:25.680
Well, Earl writes in, and he has a very interesting perspective.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.000
He says, hi, Chris, in the Mumble Room.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.960
He says, I'm a 70-year-old Linux Mint user.

13:29.960 --> 13:37.080
He says, I started Linux in early 2003 by installing Debian on a Savage Spark 64.

13:37.080 --> 13:38.200
What a chore and a lot of fun.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.940
I installed Debian on a Savage dual processor P2 later on.

13:40.940 --> 13:44.240
That was an awesome experience, but yet another challenging task.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.520
Then I discovered Ubuntu 4.10.

13:46.520 --> 13:52.280
By Ubuntu 5.10, I'd switched to Linux completely, and in 2007, I bought a Dell laptop with Linux

13:52.280 --> 13:54.340
installed on there, and I used GNOME 2.

13:54.340 --> 13:57.180
When Ubuntu moved to Unity, I moved to Linux Mint.

13:57.180 --> 13:59.560
I've been running Linux Mint with Mate ever since.

13:59.560 --> 14:05.040
Not a real tech geek, but I still feel I have some knowledge, and I wanted to comment.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.960
Mint Mate Edition doesn't get in my way.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.000
It just works.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
It's not about the desktop.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.880
It's about the programs and what I can do.

14:10.880 --> 14:14.400
I like the desktop, and I like the fact it doesn't change every month or so, other than

14:14.400 --> 14:16.200
maybe a few improvements when a new release comes out.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.520
I like that it doesn't keep changing things underneath me.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.920
It just keeps improving, and it works.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.560
Maybe it's boring, but it works.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.340
It also is about the community.

14:24.340 --> 14:25.720
I love this point.

14:25.720 --> 14:30.200
Clem keeps the users informed about what he and the team are doing and why they are doing

14:30.200 --> 14:31.200
it.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.640
He responds to user input.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.880
He addresses user issues personally.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.520
I've had some users on Linux Mint.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.640
I've had some users on Linux Mint, I guess, as you pointed out.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.440
He says, I'm a brand.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.000
All the computers are Savage, no latest and greatest.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.480
They all are just great desktops.

14:45.480 --> 14:49.680
I keep experimenting with distros, but nothing's replaced Mint Mate for me for reliability and

14:49.680 --> 14:51.240
ease of use.

14:51.240 --> 14:55.760
So he says a lot of users in this respect need this, and I completely agree.

14:55.760 --> 15:00.360
He says I watch all of the shows, and the Savage HP has a crappy video card, so he downloads

15:00.360 --> 15:05.280
and then watches what he calls his Linux soaps later, or his friends called him that.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.720
I love it.

15:06.720 --> 15:07.720
That's great.

15:07.720 --> 15:12.080
Clem writes in with his perspective on why Linux Mint for a 70-year-old is just the right

15:12.080 --> 15:13.080
distro.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.080
That makes sense, right?

15:14.080 --> 15:15.080
Totally makes sense.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.040
And we kind of said that.

15:17.040 --> 15:18.040
What distro do you use?

15:18.040 --> 15:19.040
I use Arch.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.040
Oh, really?

15:20.040 --> 15:21.040
Well, there you go.

15:21.040 --> 15:25.200
I do have Mint deployed at work, though, and I will say I just need to use an application.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.200
It's there.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.540
It has very similar key bindings.

15:27.540 --> 15:30.320
You can do a lot of things you can if you're coming from Windows or you're coming from

15:30.320 --> 15:31.760
Linux.

15:31.760 --> 15:35.880
So when you say you have Mint deployed, like Mint is your desktop at work?

15:35.880 --> 15:36.880
Yes, for one of my machines.

15:36.880 --> 15:37.880
And then at home you're running Arch?

15:37.880 --> 15:38.880
Yes.

15:38.880 --> 15:39.880
Oh, I got you.

15:39.880 --> 15:42.760
And Rotten Corpse, you're running Mint right now?

15:42.760 --> 15:43.760
Yeah.

15:43.760 --> 15:46.160
I actually dropped Arch and went to Mint.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.160
What?

15:47.160 --> 15:48.160
Tell me about this.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.160
Yeah.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.160
Well, okay.

15:50.160 --> 15:53.760
So I've been using KDE for the past couple months, and I was trying to test it out because

15:53.760 --> 15:59.200
I'm a huge GNOME fanboy, and I wanted to stop talking out of my butt about KDE.

15:59.200 --> 16:02.720
So I started using it, like deep dive, full in, everything.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.760
Oh, you're going to be perfect for today's episode, then.

16:05.760 --> 16:06.760
I guess so.

16:06.760 --> 16:14.520
And I've actually changed my opinion of KDE a lot, and I am now a huge fan of KDE.

16:14.520 --> 16:19.920
There are certain things that I can't stand, but KWin, for example, is fantastic, but that's

16:19.920 --> 16:20.920
not the point.

16:20.920 --> 16:21.920
Yeah.

16:21.920 --> 16:22.920
We'll get to that, though.

16:22.920 --> 16:23.920
Yeah.

16:23.920 --> 16:29.180
The reason why is because when I was using Arch in February, Arch destroyed KDE, like

16:29.180 --> 16:30.920
unusable breakage.

16:30.920 --> 16:36.720
So I did some updates, I did some bug fixes, I sent some workarounds and things like that.

16:36.720 --> 16:42.080
And after about 20 of those, I got sick of it and just left.

16:42.080 --> 16:49.280
So I wanted to see, okay, maybe Debian, you know, Debian is the de facto standard of not

16:49.280 --> 16:50.280
breaking anything.

16:50.280 --> 16:51.280
Right.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.280
Good, old, stable, steady, true Debian.

16:52.280 --> 16:53.280
Yeah.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.280
So I was on Debian.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.760
I actually went to CID because I wanted to get the latest versions of things.

16:57.760 --> 16:58.760
Naturally.

16:58.760 --> 17:04.400
So, you know, technically, Debian has really good rolling compatibility, and it's actually

17:04.400 --> 17:08.520
more stable because they take, even though their stuff is rolling, they take longer to

17:08.520 --> 17:12.440
test things, even in the unstable branches.

17:12.440 --> 17:16.840
So then when I get the update for KDE, I was like, let's see if Debian has messed anything

17:16.840 --> 17:17.840
up.

17:17.840 --> 17:18.840
I'm curious now.

17:18.840 --> 17:22.080
So when I check it, I see if there's any bugs, no bug reported.

17:22.080 --> 17:27.880
Then I pull in all of the KDE's new stuff, and it destroys pretty much everything.

17:27.880 --> 17:32.440
Like to the point where system settings, the most important application, doesn't work.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.440
Oh, geez.

17:33.440 --> 17:36.560
Like, it doesn't even show you any of the settings.

17:36.560 --> 17:37.560
All of them are gone.

17:37.560 --> 17:41.300
And now, when I went back like a week later after I was laughing about it, because now

17:41.300 --> 17:47.240
it's just hilarious that all of these transitional things are just breaking everywhere, I went

17:47.240 --> 17:53.360
to look at the bug support, bug reports, and it said, completely unusable, on the report

17:53.360 --> 17:54.360
of it.

17:54.360 --> 18:00.720
So then I was like, okay, well, Kubuntu, you know, they don't update that much, you know.

18:00.720 --> 18:05.720
Yeah, it's also broken, because they went to 5.2, which is not ready, and they broke

18:05.720 --> 18:06.720
it.

18:06.720 --> 18:07.720
Yeah.

18:07.720 --> 18:08.720
So Kubuntu right now is just a mess.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.560
So this is why you ended up on Mint?

18:10.560 --> 18:15.840
Yeah, because Mint hasn't broken anything, because they haven't updated much of it in

18:15.840 --> 18:16.840
a long time.

18:16.840 --> 18:17.840
Funny how that works.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.360
Yeah, they haven't broken anything for the core.

18:20.360 --> 18:26.180
So like, this transitional phase between 4 and 5 is like, just, it's just crazy to the

18:26.180 --> 18:32.080
point where right now, it's not a reasonable solution until, unless you stay on 4 and you

18:32.080 --> 18:36.800
don't update to framework 5, or you just go straight to 5 and deal with the bugs, trying

18:36.800 --> 18:39.880
to do this weird combination thing, it does not work.

18:39.880 --> 18:47.280
So I'm on Mint 17.1, because they don't have a KDE version for 17.2 right now, and I am

18:47.280 --> 18:50.680
perfectly happy with stuff not breaking.

18:50.680 --> 18:54.600
I think it echoes what Linus says a lot, you know, what his views on his kernel is, you

18:54.600 --> 18:57.600
know, get out of the way, let people run the applications they want to run.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.600
Yeah.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.080
Yeah, Mint is very much a distro like that.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.080
And you know what?

19:01.080 --> 19:06.200
I think my argument mostly wasn't around that there isn't a place for it, because I don't

19:06.200 --> 19:07.800
argue that at all.

19:07.800 --> 19:12.640
My argument was more, if I was going to cold recommend a distro to somebody, and I felt

19:12.640 --> 19:15.760
like they were the type of user that wanted that environment, which would be a lot of

19:15.760 --> 19:22.120
new users, Windows switchers, enterprise users, a lot of people, or like Earl, right?

19:22.120 --> 19:24.280
I think I would recommend Ubuntu Mate.

19:24.280 --> 19:28.280
I do not think I would necessarily recommend Mint necessarily.

19:28.280 --> 19:34.000
Mostly because I would, if it was a perfect world, I would like to be able to just recommend

19:34.000 --> 19:35.520
vanilla Ubuntu.

19:35.520 --> 19:38.160
Just go download the Ubuntu ISO and use that.

19:38.160 --> 19:42.180
However, I'm not convinced that Unity 7 is something I want to start switching people

19:42.180 --> 19:44.140
to right now at this point in time.

19:44.140 --> 19:47.440
And also the search scopes are still embarrassing.

19:47.440 --> 19:51.020
Like we actually had a problem this week when we were trying to shoot a screen cap for Linux

19:51.020 --> 19:55.840
action show, and the first time through, like bra and underwear came up in the search scope.

19:55.840 --> 19:56.840
And it's like, really?

19:56.840 --> 19:57.840
We don't really want to put bra and underwear?

19:57.840 --> 20:00.560
I mean, it's kind of funny, but at the same time it's like, really?

20:00.560 --> 20:03.640
We're trying to have a professional demonstration here and bra and underwear is coming up in

20:03.640 --> 20:04.640
our search results.

20:04.640 --> 20:07.640
And I just don't want to recommend that to somebody, but I want to stay as close to the

20:07.640 --> 20:12.080
upstream distro, so an official flavor to me seems like a pretty logical choice.

20:12.080 --> 20:15.280
And the Mate desktop environments, classic desktop environment, people are very familiar

20:15.280 --> 20:16.280
with it.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.360
You can get the LTS version.

20:18.360 --> 20:22.680
When I stack that up against Mint, I'm not quite sure why I would recommend Mint over

20:22.680 --> 20:25.180
the other, other than they do take care of some of the other niceties.

20:25.180 --> 20:29.960
And like Earl said, Clems, like I really, if I was in Earl's position, I would like

20:29.960 --> 20:34.080
to be able to have a community leader who was also very clear and very transparent,

20:34.080 --> 20:36.720
and that would be something that would appeal to me too.

20:36.720 --> 20:37.720
But yeah, mumble.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.160
Any other thoughts on that before we move on to our next email, which is really kind

20:40.160 --> 20:42.160
of one that made me think?

20:42.160 --> 20:43.160
Going once?

20:43.160 --> 20:46.240
Yeah, I'd like to say I agree with the official flavor thing.

20:46.240 --> 20:50.480
The only reason I'm not, I'm using Mint right now is because the Kubuntu thing's weird.

20:50.480 --> 20:54.000
But if somebody wanted Mate, absolutely, Ubuntu Mate is the better option.

20:54.000 --> 20:57.640
I think the only other reason for Mint right now would be if somebody wanted Cinnamon.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.680
That's what I'm using.

20:59.680 --> 21:00.680
Yeah.

21:00.680 --> 21:01.680
Yeah.

21:01.680 --> 21:02.680
Okay.

21:02.680 --> 21:03.680
I mean, my work machine has a business card.

21:03.680 --> 21:04.680
And how is that?

21:04.680 --> 21:05.680
So, it handles it very well, actually.

21:05.680 --> 21:06.680
Yeah.

21:06.680 --> 21:10.360
Three display point monitors, hardly ever a glitch.

21:10.360 --> 21:15.500
Yeah, and Cinnamon's a pretty good environment for like a, for sort of a parallel to, somewhere

21:15.500 --> 21:16.500
between Gnome and KDE.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.500
Yeah.

21:17.500 --> 21:20.240
A lot of people I work with kind of come from a Windows background as well.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.560
And so, you know, you can split Windows up on the four sides.

21:22.560 --> 21:23.560
You have some start bar.

21:23.560 --> 21:24.560
Yeah.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.520
It has some graphical niceties that they're used to.

21:26.520 --> 21:27.520
Yeah.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.520
Yeah.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.520
Mumble room?

21:29.520 --> 21:30.520
Any more?

21:30.520 --> 21:35.080
Chris, I was wondering, are we getting to a point where anybody that's just a casual

21:35.080 --> 21:39.240
user or interested in getting work done should be on an LTS?

21:39.240 --> 21:43.340
And the only people that we recommend rolling to are people that are looking for the latest

21:43.340 --> 21:47.000
and greatest teacher or have a specific hardware support issue?

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
That's a great question.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.600
I think you should recommend rolling to anyone unless they want it, they ask you for it.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.000
I think we should answer that question.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.960
I think we should see if we can answer that question when we get to the OpenSUSE follow-up.

21:56.960 --> 22:01.200
Because that's exactly the question OpenSUSE says, so you're going to have Tumbleweed,

22:01.200 --> 22:02.200
which is a rolling release.

22:02.200 --> 22:05.480
They're going to, oh, they claim it's going to be the world's first stable rolling release

22:05.480 --> 22:09.620
because only things go into the rolling release after they've been fully tested by our magic

22:09.620 --> 22:11.380
testing system.

22:11.380 --> 22:12.380
That's according to them.

22:12.380 --> 22:14.760
So they're going to have rolling releases, then they're going to have OpenSUSE, which

22:14.760 --> 22:19.040
is going to be somewhere in between a real steady enterprise distro, but it's going to

22:19.040 --> 22:20.600
be sourced from an enterprise distro.

22:20.600 --> 22:24.800
So that's kind of going to be somewhere like in the CentOS range of type products, somewhere

22:24.800 --> 22:26.800
between CentOS and Fedora if I'm following.

22:26.800 --> 22:29.040
And of course, we're going to talk about all this in a minute.

22:29.040 --> 22:33.640
And then you're going to have, of course, the SLE, the SUSE Linux Enterprise editions.

22:33.640 --> 22:38.440
And what you just said, that could be where OpenSUSE is going to fit very, very nicely

22:38.440 --> 22:39.600
potentially.

22:39.600 --> 22:40.920
So we'll just have to, but maybe not.

22:40.920 --> 22:41.920
And maybe I have that wrong.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.600
We'll talk about that in the SUSE segment.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.280
But first, I want to get to Stefan's email.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.680
This one got me thinking, long time listener, he says, huge fan of just about all of the

22:48.680 --> 22:49.680
shows.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.880
I'm sure he meant all of them, not just about.

22:51.880 --> 22:52.880
Of course.

22:52.880 --> 22:55.400
He says, I'm writing because the conversation around privacy and trusting your data and

22:55.400 --> 22:59.460
information, especially with companies like Google, seems to always result in, and this

22:59.460 --> 23:02.960
is his quote here, we shouldn't because that's just creepy.

23:02.960 --> 23:06.420
We feel that it's not morally right for companies to sell or use our data in order to serve

23:06.420 --> 23:10.880
free products and services, to which I do agree, or at least I think I do.

23:10.880 --> 23:15.640
Would it be possible for you to talk about why exactly this is not okay?

23:15.640 --> 23:16.920
What are we afraid of?

23:16.920 --> 23:23.840
Why should we take so good care of our privacy and personal information in the first place?

23:23.840 --> 23:24.840
Is it all just aggregated?

23:24.840 --> 23:28.960
And isn't it all just being aggregated and impersonalized by a bunch of computers anyways

23:28.960 --> 23:32.040
and grouped together with thousands of other people's information?

23:32.040 --> 23:35.680
Has this just become a principle that storing user data is wrong?

23:35.680 --> 23:39.120
Why is this fight so important to fight?

23:39.120 --> 23:43.000
We want technology to engage with us in every aspect of our life, yet the companies developing

23:43.000 --> 23:46.560
these technologies are not allowed to know anything about us?

23:46.560 --> 23:48.000
That doesn't sound about right.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.400
Why is my weight, age, sex, height, favorite food, most used train station, travel history,

23:53.400 --> 23:58.920
etc., so damn important that I should know them and only I should know them?

23:58.920 --> 24:01.000
And again, is that really privacy?

24:01.000 --> 24:03.800
Best regards, Stefan, and keep up the amazing work.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.560
What a fast, why, Wes, what do you think?

24:05.560 --> 24:07.600
Do you ever get creeped out about Google?

24:07.600 --> 24:09.480
You know, they are somewhat integrated.

24:09.480 --> 24:10.840
I do appreciate his argument.

24:10.840 --> 24:14.440
I was installing Telegram on my girlfriend's iPhone the other day.

24:14.440 --> 24:17.280
You know, I've been using it with some of my friends, and she wanted to use it too.

24:17.280 --> 24:20.360
And I was telling her about some of the encryption, and I'd used TechSecure before.

24:20.360 --> 24:23.120
And whenever I mention encryption, she does kind of just laugh.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.160
You know, she understands, but...

24:25.160 --> 24:26.160
Not a priority for her.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.160
Not at all.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.160
Yeah.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.760
I don't think she has any problem with Google, you know, knowing every little bit about her.

24:30.760 --> 24:31.760
I waffle on this.

24:31.760 --> 24:32.760
I go back and forth.

24:32.760 --> 24:33.760
I do too.

24:33.760 --> 24:38.800
Sometimes I think it's really a great service, and how can you have JARVIS and Star Trek

24:38.800 --> 24:42.920
Enterprise computer system and all these things without that data collection?

24:42.920 --> 24:50.440
At the same time, though, I think I have put my finger on what creeps me out about it,

24:50.440 --> 24:51.440
but I'm going to hold on to that for a second.

24:51.440 --> 24:52.440
I'll let Wimpy jump in.

24:52.440 --> 24:53.440
Wimpy, you go first.

24:53.440 --> 24:54.840
What do you think?

24:54.840 --> 24:57.320
What's your take on this topic?

24:57.320 --> 25:02.800
Well, I live in the UK.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.360
And the UK is doing some crazy things at the moment.

25:05.360 --> 25:12.920
So our government believes that the UK citizens have no right to electronic privacy anymore.

25:12.920 --> 25:20.600
And I would say that this is important because if your civil liberties and your privacy are

25:20.600 --> 25:25.760
eroded bit by bit, piece by piece, and you don't think it's important, these are just

25:25.760 --> 25:27.640
stepping stones.

25:27.640 --> 25:30.920
And it might not be this thing or the next thing, but maybe the thing after that or the

25:30.920 --> 25:35.840
thing after that is the thing that you think is too much, too far, that encroaches into

25:35.840 --> 25:38.040
your life.

25:38.040 --> 25:45.080
And certainly in the UK, if they're going to ban, in air quotes, some of these encrypted

25:45.080 --> 25:50.640
messaging platforms, which we've now concluded is basically anything that's encrypted, then

25:50.640 --> 25:56.160
that gives people the right to, or gives the government the right to potentially siphon

25:56.160 --> 26:01.240
and archive your message streams that you're using over encrypted channels, such as like

26:01.240 --> 26:02.840
Facebook Messenger.

26:02.840 --> 26:07.880
So if your family is using Facebook Messenger to send photographs of your family members

26:07.880 --> 26:12.080
and your children backwards and forwards, and the government is taking a feed off that

26:12.080 --> 26:17.400
and doing percentage of flesh tone analysis, is your account now being flagged up because

26:17.400 --> 26:20.940
you've got young children that are prone to taking off all their clothes and running around

26:20.940 --> 26:23.520
in the garden naked?

26:23.520 --> 26:26.440
And do you now look like a suspicious individual?

26:26.440 --> 26:28.840
And should you not have a right to privacy?

26:28.840 --> 26:30.040
I wonder about that same thing.

26:30.040 --> 26:35.960
Like if my wife sends me a picture of our daughter's butt in the bathtub, and that goes

26:35.960 --> 26:40.560
through Hangouts, and they're analyzing everything that goes through Hangouts, is there some

26:40.560 --> 26:43.820
algorithm analyzing my daughter's butt and flagging my account for having nudity in my

26:43.820 --> 26:44.820
...

26:44.820 --> 26:45.820
That's a good question.

26:45.820 --> 26:46.820
How do I know?

26:46.820 --> 26:47.820
Exactly.

26:47.820 --> 26:50.340
I think that's a big part, too, is for right now with the technology we have, maybe there

26:50.340 --> 26:54.120
aren't that many ramifications, but we don't know what kind of retention policies maybe

26:54.120 --> 26:55.120
are in effect.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.120
It's a huge part of it.

26:56.120 --> 26:59.560
You can recognize people based on iris scans, face profiles.

26:59.560 --> 27:01.840
I'm not trying to be a conspiracy theorist, but...

27:01.840 --> 27:03.760
The computing power just keeps getting better and better.

27:03.760 --> 27:04.760
Right.

27:04.760 --> 27:06.680
The map produced these things, and you can learn a lot.

27:06.680 --> 27:10.920
Wimpy, also there's a certain amount of power a company like Google has when they know everybody

27:10.920 --> 27:12.840
I'm with, every location I'm at all the time.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.040
Does that concern you?

27:15.040 --> 27:21.200
To some extent, more so if now governments are wanting to put hooks into organizations

27:21.200 --> 27:25.640
such as Google and Facebook, because there's a proven track record of people that work

27:25.640 --> 27:33.280
for the security services to not be discreet in the way that they access this data for

27:33.280 --> 27:36.280
lulls and giggles.

27:36.280 --> 27:41.100
Your stuff isn't private anymore, because they're just perusing over it when it takes

27:41.100 --> 27:43.840
their fancy, and that seems to be.

27:43.840 --> 27:47.760
The only papers I've seen published about that were from North America, but it seemed

27:47.760 --> 27:50.920
to be an alarming number of people that had abused that privilege.

27:50.920 --> 27:51.920
Yes.

27:51.920 --> 27:52.920
That's a good point.

27:52.920 --> 27:54.400
The people that are in that position sometimes abuse that.

27:54.400 --> 27:57.040
Ubi, you want to take the other side of the fence as somebody who's not quite as concerned

27:57.040 --> 28:00.000
about privacy, right?

28:00.000 --> 28:07.080
To be honest, I am quite concerned about privacy, but I know people who aren't, as a lot of

28:07.080 --> 28:08.640
people do.

28:08.640 --> 28:15.440
A point that I find hard to argue against, maybe there can be some ideas here, is why

28:15.440 --> 28:19.140
care because there's so much data they're collecting that they won't be interested in

28:19.140 --> 28:24.160
looking at mine?

28:24.160 --> 28:29.280
Because it's not individuals looking at your data, it's computers looking at the data in

28:29.280 --> 28:35.320
aggregate, and computers are flawed, and so my example of flesh tone analysis is a real

28:35.320 --> 28:41.640
example where your legitimate and legal use of a service could flag your account as being

28:41.640 --> 28:46.520
suspicious and now you're under observation for doing nothing wrong.

28:46.520 --> 28:51.880
It's not that you've got nothing to hide, it's that you shouldn't have anything that

28:51.880 --> 28:52.880
people are prying upon.

28:52.880 --> 28:57.000
I mean, if the UK government suddenly want to conduct all of their communications in

28:57.000 --> 29:01.440
the clear, then I'll back their proposals, but until they do that, it's a nonsense.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.440
Yeah, that's interesting.

29:03.440 --> 29:06.880
Just as easily as computers can anonymize the data, they can also de-anonymize it.

29:06.880 --> 29:07.880
Yes, very good point.

29:07.880 --> 29:12.440
Okay, so here's kind of where I come down on it, and I think about like the long-term

29:12.440 --> 29:15.420
picture here, and I think what Wes was kind of touching on is like computing power is

29:15.420 --> 29:18.800
only going to get better, storage is only going to get greater, and they can keep this

29:18.800 --> 29:22.340
stuff for years and years and years, and sometimes what you find when you read through history

29:22.340 --> 29:27.920
is what we find to be sort of totally acceptable and okay today will not necessarily be totally

29:27.920 --> 29:29.840
fine and acceptable 20 years ago.

29:29.840 --> 29:36.220
And when I think about my son and my daughters, who will, my son, for God's sakes, already

29:36.220 --> 29:38.040
has like a children's Google account.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.040
Oh, wow.

29:39.040 --> 29:42.480
Yeah, because he's at school and he's six years old, and now he can get on YouTube and

29:42.480 --> 29:44.480
look at like a kid's version of YouTube.

29:44.480 --> 29:47.440
He already has a Google account.

29:47.440 --> 29:52.280
Now I know they have different policies for how they track children, but in a large sense,

29:52.280 --> 29:56.440
my son at six years old has already begun getting just about everything he does online

29:56.440 --> 29:57.440
logged.

29:57.440 --> 30:00.160
Does the 20-year-old him feel that he really consented to do that?

30:00.160 --> 30:01.160
Right.

30:01.160 --> 30:06.720
And will 20-year-old him really want to be, you know, like once it's recorded, it never

30:06.720 --> 30:07.720
goes away.

30:07.720 --> 30:08.720
Exactly.

30:08.720 --> 30:12.640
And people change a lot, and it's just to have all of that on file and then to have

30:12.640 --> 30:16.840
this AI that can sit back there and analyze it and determine what kind of person you are

30:16.840 --> 30:19.800
so that way they can better target dick pills at you.

30:19.800 --> 30:22.800
I just don't find it to be a valuable trade.

30:22.800 --> 30:24.120
It's not worth it for me.

30:24.120 --> 30:27.000
Sunsol, you think the convenience does trump in the end?

30:27.000 --> 30:29.160
I mean, it appears to be so far, right?

30:29.160 --> 30:30.160
Yeah.

30:30.160 --> 30:32.760
I mean, I think like let's just be frank.

30:32.760 --> 30:35.680
Like when you get a cell phone, your privacy is out.

30:35.680 --> 30:36.680
You know what I mean?

30:36.680 --> 30:40.480
Like once you turn on that phone, like you've almost given a lot of your privacy away.

30:40.480 --> 30:41.480
That's true, huh?

30:41.480 --> 30:47.120
I mean, not trying to, you know, be the devil's advocate here, but it's just that like users

30:47.120 --> 30:48.120
really love convenience.

30:48.120 --> 30:49.120
You know what I mean?

30:49.120 --> 30:54.200
Like just whether it's your Siri, iPhone, whether it's Google on your cell phone or

30:54.200 --> 30:58.480
whatever it is, like just having that convenience to get data at your fingertips is what users

30:58.480 --> 30:59.480
really like.

30:59.480 --> 31:00.480
Yeah.

31:00.480 --> 31:01.480
Or you know what?

31:01.480 --> 31:02.480
You could zoom out.

31:02.480 --> 31:04.280
I mean, phones is what's on our mind really, but it's if you use a credit card, you know,

31:04.280 --> 31:08.160
a bank account, all this stuff, there's data brokers that are aggregating all of it, but

31:08.160 --> 31:09.160
that's a great point.

31:09.160 --> 31:13.820
Wimpy, I want to give you the final word and then we'll move on to some other Linuxy feedback,

31:13.820 --> 31:17.120
but I want to give you one last chance to jump in.

31:17.120 --> 31:23.800
So cryptography allows us the facility to have non-repudiation, which is to prove that

31:23.800 --> 31:26.640
I sent something and it hasn't been tampered with.

31:26.640 --> 31:31.220
In the meantime, a hacking team were beautifully hacked last week.

31:31.220 --> 31:36.040
The delicious irony of that is not lost upon me, but one of the products that they sell

31:36.040 --> 31:45.840
is a product that deliberately injects false evidence into a target's computer system so

31:45.840 --> 31:51.640
that they can be tried in a, air quotes, court of law.

31:51.640 --> 31:55.960
And if we are now in a position where you have no expectation of privacy and encryption

31:55.960 --> 32:01.000
is not a tool that's open to you, then what's going to happen in some of these oppressive

32:01.000 --> 32:07.520
regimes or even in the UK if they decide that they don't, you know, you're not flavor of

32:07.520 --> 32:08.520
the month anymore.

32:08.520 --> 32:12.800
It makes it all the easier to actually inject evidence, you know, false evidence into your

32:12.800 --> 32:13.800
system.

32:13.800 --> 32:14.800
Hmm.

32:14.800 --> 32:15.800
Yeah.

32:15.800 --> 32:16.800
And Corky makes a great point in the chat room.

32:16.800 --> 32:20.480
He can't join because there's a ping spike, but he says, when data is permanent, you have

32:20.480 --> 32:24.320
to hope that every single executive or CEO or government that has access to that data

32:24.320 --> 32:26.200
does not use it against you.

32:26.200 --> 32:30.360
One government gone wrong could have a large leverage to prosecute you or prison you or

32:30.360 --> 32:32.640
to destroy your reputation or to silence you.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.640
That's a big part, too.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.640
Corporations go bankrupt and sell off their assets that, you know, you might trust Google

32:37.640 --> 32:41.240
to have that, but the person who buys Google in 30 years, you don't like someone.

32:41.240 --> 32:45.080
Or when Larry and Sergey step down, does the new guy that runs the place have a different

32:45.080 --> 32:48.160
concern about how much privacy users get to enjoy?

32:48.160 --> 32:49.920
Well, I think this is fascinating.

32:49.920 --> 32:50.920
You know what?

32:50.920 --> 32:51.920
I see NorthRanger has a topic.

32:51.920 --> 32:52.920
We'll pick it up in the post show, too, if you guys want.

32:52.920 --> 32:57.640
It's a fascinating topic, but I want to get to some of the other Linux emails we've gotten,

32:57.640 --> 33:02.040
but it's one that, you know, privacy and security is a huge reason why we use open source in

33:02.040 --> 33:06.560
Linux, so I don't think it's a conversation that is not worth having.

33:06.560 --> 33:10.360
I just think we have to bide our time, but we'll do more in the post show.

33:10.360 --> 33:11.840
That sounds pretty fascinating.

33:11.840 --> 33:17.320
I wanted to get to an email that came into the show about, well, about Flash, to be honest,

33:17.320 --> 33:18.320
in a sense.

33:18.320 --> 33:21.960
But sometimes people that want to watch our show have to use a proprietary technology

33:21.960 --> 33:22.960
to do so.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.360
Like maybe you're going to watch an HD64 encoded video, or maybe you're going to watch the

33:25.360 --> 33:26.360
live Flash stream.

33:26.360 --> 33:30.040
Well, some big, big developments are happening this week, really big, actually, today that

33:30.040 --> 33:32.960
may finally change this for good, I hope.

33:32.960 --> 33:36.600
And a very public company and two very public browsers are taking a very public position

33:36.600 --> 33:37.640
on all of that.

33:37.640 --> 33:41.000
But before we talk about, hopefully, the final death of Flash, I want to mention our friends

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
at Ting.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000
Go to linux.ting.com.

33:43.000 --> 33:47.640
Now, when Wes got here the other day, he was like, geez, Chris, how many phones do you got?

33:47.640 --> 33:49.800
And I was like, Wes, man, I got plenty of phones.

33:49.800 --> 33:50.800
Why?

33:50.800 --> 33:51.800
Because it's $6 a line.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.280
Yeah, I love Ting.

33:53.280 --> 33:57.160
So I've got right now in my hot hands right here, I've got the Galaxy S6.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.720
And it's been a really great phone for me.

33:58.720 --> 33:59.920
It's recently available on the Ting network.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.360
And here's what's fantastic about Ting.

34:01.360 --> 34:02.720
You only pay for what you use.

34:02.720 --> 34:05.840
Ting takes your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes, and they add them all up.

34:05.840 --> 34:08.480
Whatever bucket you fall into, that's all you've got to pay.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.680
And it's just $6 for the line and then the taxes.

34:10.680 --> 34:14.600
So it makes it very economical to have several lines if you've got like a family, or maybe

34:14.600 --> 34:18.000
you have a small business and you want to give folks in your business some lines.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.400
Or in my case, when we had a nanny for a short period of time, I got her a phone.

34:22.400 --> 34:23.880
And it sounds like, oh my gosh, you're such a baller.

34:23.880 --> 34:24.880
Well, no.

34:24.880 --> 34:27.920
You can get an unlocked phone for under $100, and it's $6 for the line, and you just pay

34:27.920 --> 34:29.380
for your usage on top of that.

34:29.380 --> 34:32.180
And then what's really fantastic about Ting is the way their business is structured, they're

34:32.180 --> 34:34.160
really able to focus on the customer.

34:34.160 --> 34:36.960
And so they're able to build out additional functionality that most carriers wouldn't

34:36.960 --> 34:37.960
bother with.

34:37.960 --> 34:43.040
Like they have really great mobile applications and a fantastic web UI to manage all of this.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.240
It's really good stuff.

34:44.240 --> 34:45.840
And they have no hold customer service.

34:45.840 --> 34:49.680
You can call them at 1-855-TING-FTW, and a real person answers the phone.

34:49.680 --> 34:52.960
Now here's the core essentials that I love about Ting.

34:52.960 --> 34:56.040
Unlocked phones, you own them outright, and you're only paying for what you use.

34:56.040 --> 34:58.160
Like hotspot tethering, it's all built in.

34:58.160 --> 35:02.240
So no more like prepaying for like, oh, I might use 800 minutes, so I better buy the

35:02.240 --> 35:04.000
1,000 minute plan, like that kind of crap.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.680
Or like I might need three gigs of data, but they only offer six gigs if I need that much

35:07.680 --> 35:08.680
data.

35:08.680 --> 35:09.960
That is done.

35:09.960 --> 35:15.400
And really, it is so liberating when you realize that once I get the phone and I do all that,

35:15.400 --> 35:16.400
that's done.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.400
Like that's the hardest part.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.400
I'm easy.

35:18.400 --> 35:19.400
I'm ready to go.

35:19.400 --> 35:20.400
And here's the best part.

35:20.400 --> 35:23.440
When you go to linux.ting.com, you're going to take $25 off an unlocked device.

35:23.440 --> 35:27.400
And if you've got a Ting-compatible device, and there's a whole S-ton of Ting-compatible

35:27.400 --> 35:30.400
devices, because check this out, they've got a GSM network and a CDMA network.

35:30.400 --> 35:33.120
And if you get a fancy phone, you can swap between the networks.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.960
I've done that with the Nexus 5, for example.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.280
So you get these phones.

35:36.280 --> 35:37.280
They're unlocked.

35:37.280 --> 35:41.160
And if you get your phone to a high-end like Nexus 6 or Moto X2 or, I don't know, the OnePlus

35:41.160 --> 35:45.920
or the S6 or iPhone 6, whatever you want to get, Ting's got it.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.520
And then you're on the plan and you're done.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.520
The hard part's over.

35:48.520 --> 35:49.520
And that's not even that hard.

35:49.520 --> 35:52.800
$6 a month, pay for what you use, call them any time you've got an issue.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.040
It's really slick.

35:54.040 --> 35:55.380
Go to linux.ting.com.

35:55.380 --> 35:57.920
That supports the show and gets you the discount.

35:57.920 --> 36:02.280
Also, this is a really slick way to go if you want like a MiFi device.

36:02.280 --> 36:09.240
If you're in any kind of job or if you just have a need for a high level of connectivity,

36:09.240 --> 36:12.720
what a great way to do this at an incredible value, because you're only paying for what

36:12.720 --> 36:14.080
you use with Ting.

36:14.080 --> 36:17.900
So go get a MiFi device, you buy it once, and then it's just $6 a month and then any

36:17.900 --> 36:21.080
data usage.

36:21.080 --> 36:27.720
As an independent contractor when I was doing IT, I had this really expensive MiFi device

36:27.720 --> 36:30.040
from one of the duopoly mobile providers.

36:30.040 --> 36:34.240
And I lived with the guilt every time it sat in my drawer for like a couple of weeks and

36:34.240 --> 36:35.240
I didn't use it.

36:35.240 --> 36:37.760
I could hear Angela in the back of my mind, that's a waste of money, that thing costs

36:37.760 --> 36:40.720
us $60 a month, how come you're not using it right now?

36:40.720 --> 36:44.720
And I would just like bring it with me just in case I might need it because I am paying

36:44.720 --> 36:46.960
so much money for it and I wouldn't use it.

36:46.960 --> 36:51.660
Now this is gone with Ting because you're only paying for what you use.

36:51.660 --> 36:55.040
If you don't use the MiFi device, it's just $6 for the line, but here's the even better

36:55.040 --> 36:56.040
part.

36:56.040 --> 36:57.040
I can't even believe Ting let you do this.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.120
You can just turn the line off for a while.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.480
You can just turn it off.

37:00.480 --> 37:01.480
How slick is that?

37:01.480 --> 37:04.920
Go to linux.ting.com to get started, check out their dashboard, they have a savings calculator

37:04.920 --> 37:05.920
there.

37:05.920 --> 37:08.160
Also, while you're there, peruse their blog.

37:08.160 --> 37:13.480
They've got great app pics, they have an unboxing of the Moto E second gen edition and they

37:13.480 --> 37:19.560
also have app pics there as always and like tips for Google Maps, really cool stuff.

37:19.560 --> 37:24.520
Linux.ting.com and a huge, huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged

37:24.520 --> 37:25.520
program.

37:25.520 --> 37:28.040
Linux.ting.com and thanks to everybody who visits that because that supports the show

37:28.040 --> 37:31.360
and lets Ting know that you appreciate them keeping us on the air.

37:31.360 --> 37:32.360
Right Wes?

37:32.360 --> 37:33.360
Oh yeah.

37:33.360 --> 37:34.360
Hey, thank you for grabbing me another beer, sir.

37:34.360 --> 37:35.360
I really appreciate that.

37:35.360 --> 37:36.360
My pleasure.

37:36.360 --> 37:37.360
All right.

37:37.360 --> 37:38.360
So we got a little bit more feedback.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.520
I kind of want to pick up the pace just a tad because I want to get to some of the big

37:40.520 --> 37:45.360
topics today, but let's talk about this huge, huge, huge story and I want to start, kick

37:45.360 --> 37:52.240
it off with a piece of feedback that I get almost at least a weekly basis, more often

37:52.240 --> 37:54.820
in the chat room on a daily basis.

37:54.820 --> 37:58.160
So this came in from Yellow Mango, which is kind of funny, he says, while setting up my

37:58.160 --> 38:00.960
new Fedora install, I went to add my favorite podcast to Rhythmbox.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.120
Oh, thanks man.

38:02.120 --> 38:05.800
And however, when I went to play the video, I noticed I needed to download a decoder.

38:05.800 --> 38:08.280
The decoder just happens to be a non-free one.

38:08.280 --> 38:12.120
Why in the world is an open source focused podcast using a non-free encoding?

38:12.120 --> 38:14.800
Maybe there's a legitimate reason I just don't know about it.

38:14.800 --> 38:19.400
And this comes in in a couple of different phases or different ways like you guys have

38:19.400 --> 38:21.960
a flash player, for example, like our livestream.

38:21.960 --> 38:25.080
And Wes, what are your thoughts on when it comes down to this codec stuff?

38:25.080 --> 38:26.880
Do you have a hard line on this at all?

38:26.880 --> 38:30.320
I mean, I definitely follow the people over at Ziff.org, you know, Monty and his wonderful

38:30.320 --> 38:36.640
demos and I would love for open source and free codecs to rule the world, but I think

38:36.640 --> 38:39.480
the top commenter in this Reddit post does have a certain point that...

38:39.480 --> 38:40.480
What did he say?

38:40.480 --> 38:41.480
I didn't see that.

38:41.480 --> 38:44.320
He said, because he wants to actually be discovered and watched by 95% of the world who live in

38:44.320 --> 38:48.040
proprietary prisons, which unfortunately many people do.

38:48.040 --> 38:51.880
Oh, there is a sort of a sick truth to that.

38:51.880 --> 38:54.040
There is definitely a sick truth to that.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.440
So yeah, we do actually pretty make...

38:56.440 --> 38:58.520
We make every show available in WebM.

38:58.520 --> 38:59.520
Yeah, which is awesome.

38:59.520 --> 39:01.840
But we don't necessarily make it available for direct download.

39:01.840 --> 39:06.800
We, in most cases, make it available via torrent, which is linked in the show notes in most

39:06.800 --> 39:07.800
cases.

39:07.800 --> 39:12.240
The thing is, is we've not been very happy with WebM, so it costs us a lot to store it

39:12.240 --> 39:13.360
and distribute it.

39:13.360 --> 39:20.440
It actually costs us more to distribute a 420p version of a show in WebM than it does

39:20.440 --> 39:24.720
to distribute a 720p version of the show in x264.

39:24.720 --> 39:34.600
So it is only because we want to see open standards progress that we actually pay...

39:34.600 --> 39:37.480
WebM is the most expensive thing we distribute.

39:37.480 --> 39:38.480
So it is...

39:38.480 --> 39:39.480
Kudos to you guys.

39:39.480 --> 39:43.360
Well, it makes HTML5 playback work, so that's another reason why we have to do it.

39:43.360 --> 39:50.700
And then Rekai can attest to the fact that it is by far, by far, by far the slowest file

39:50.700 --> 39:51.960
to encode.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.440
We can get...

39:53.440 --> 39:58.960
We could crank out four HD versions almost of a show in the time it takes one 420p WebM

39:58.960 --> 40:00.360
version to come out.

40:00.360 --> 40:05.360
Almost four versions of the HD version in the time it takes one WebM version to be encoded,

40:05.360 --> 40:06.680
almost that long.

40:06.680 --> 40:12.240
And so this, though, often comes up in terms of our jblive.tv live stream, which is powered

40:12.240 --> 40:15.060
by Flash, because really, live streaming...

40:15.060 --> 40:17.320
We have other options, in fact.

40:17.320 --> 40:20.320
By the end of this segment, I think we should all just disable Flash in our computers for

40:20.320 --> 40:21.320
a week and see if it works.

40:21.320 --> 40:22.320
Amen.

40:22.320 --> 40:26.960
Go to jblive.tv and grab the RTMP or HLS stream and watch it MPV or VLC.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.240
So I'll say that up front.

40:28.240 --> 40:32.760
But we do have one Flash player on the Jupyter broadcasting site, and that's our live player.

40:32.760 --> 40:36.720
Well, today, depending on what browser you're in, you may have had troubles loading the

40:36.720 --> 40:42.400
live stream, because Mozilla, and I think Google Chrome too today, have started blocking

40:42.400 --> 40:46.800
Flash, just as Facebook's security chief calls for its death, all in light of the hacking

40:46.800 --> 40:50.460
group that Wimpy was just talking about getting hacked and zero-day Flash vulnerabilities

40:50.460 --> 40:52.560
being splashed all over the Web.

40:52.560 --> 40:55.960
Adobe's been scrambling to patch these new zero-day vulnerabilities, and in response

40:55.960 --> 40:59.640
to that, the Facebook security chief has taken up the Steve Jobs mantle of saying, kill Flash,

40:59.640 --> 41:02.060
kill Flash, and is proclaiming its death.

41:02.060 --> 41:06.480
He says the time is now, and in response, Mozilla is disabling Flash because the zero-day

41:06.480 --> 41:09.960
is affecting Flash installations right now as we record this show.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.560
There's a lot of stuff happening here.

41:11.560 --> 41:13.800
Do you think the Web is ready for Flash to die, Wes?

41:13.800 --> 41:15.000
I really wish that it was.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Personally, I am.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.480
I don't think I need it.

41:17.480 --> 41:21.760
But I recognize there are a lot of users with random use cases, like, oh, my one banking

41:21.760 --> 41:24.680
company requires me to use Flash for this login form, or who knows.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.360
But I feel like we hear a lot about those one-time uses.

41:26.360 --> 41:31.520
Wimpy, I bet you have a few of those use cases in mind, don't you?

41:31.520 --> 41:32.520
Mr. Wimpy?

41:32.520 --> 41:33.520
Oh, sorry.

41:33.520 --> 41:34.520
Oh, there you go.

41:34.520 --> 41:35.520
Yep.

41:35.520 --> 41:36.520
Thank you.

41:36.520 --> 41:37.520
Thank you.

41:37.520 --> 41:38.520
So can you hear me?

41:38.520 --> 41:39.520
Yep.

41:39.520 --> 41:40.520
We got you.

41:40.520 --> 41:41.520
Yeah.

41:41.520 --> 41:42.520
Can you hear?

41:42.520 --> 41:43.520
Yeah.

41:43.520 --> 41:44.520
OK.

41:44.520 --> 41:45.520
Yeah.

41:45.520 --> 41:55.320
In the UK, Amazon Prime, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5, and catch-up TV services all

41:55.320 --> 41:57.080
use Flash.

41:57.080 --> 42:05.000
Some of them even use the DRM module in Flash, which is no longer supported on most Linux

42:05.000 --> 42:11.200
systems because HAL went away that used to provide that little crypto stub.

42:11.200 --> 42:18.080
So if Flash goes away, then all of the major UK streaming services cease to be relevant

42:18.080 --> 42:22.240
for Linux users because there is no other option.

42:22.240 --> 42:23.240
Wow.

42:23.240 --> 42:28.880
You know, the only one that continues to work is Netflix using Google Chrome, which is also

42:28.880 --> 42:29.880
proprietary.

42:29.880 --> 42:32.080
But this is not about Flash on Linux.

42:32.080 --> 42:37.640
This is a Flash in general, and that Mozilla and Google are blocking it across the platform.

42:37.640 --> 42:40.600
So yeah, but the same is true.

42:40.600 --> 42:46.440
These services, with the exception of Amazon Prime, which you can use Silverlight for on

42:46.440 --> 42:50.520
Windows, all of those other streaming services require Flash regardless of whether you're

42:50.520 --> 42:52.520
on Windows or Linux.

42:52.520 --> 42:53.520
Right.

42:53.520 --> 42:58.480
But I'd rather Flash die and those services not work and make them actually use something

42:58.480 --> 43:04.720
that isn't garbage for a downtime of like a month or two than to just throw your hands

43:04.720 --> 43:05.720
up and give up.

43:05.720 --> 43:06.720
Yeah, those services aren't going to change in a hurry.

43:06.720 --> 43:08.840
Well, let me, let me, let's just, as for, just for fun discussion purposes.

43:08.840 --> 43:12.040
If anyone was going to move away from Flash, people have started doing it more aggressively.

43:12.040 --> 43:16.720
But don't you think now, Wimpy, with them disabling it in Firefox and things like that,

43:16.720 --> 43:20.320
don't you think that's going to accelerate, because this, like Rotten said, this isn't

43:20.320 --> 43:21.320
a Linux thing.

43:21.320 --> 43:22.320
This is everybody.

43:22.320 --> 43:26.960
And plus, the iOS platform and Android platforms are not Flash friendly still, so there's incentive

43:26.960 --> 43:27.960
to get off there.

43:27.960 --> 43:29.880
Do you think this push could do it?

43:29.880 --> 43:30.880
Hopefully.

43:30.880 --> 43:36.160
I mean, if it was just Mozilla doing it, then, you know, there'd be a, you know, you couldn't

43:36.160 --> 43:37.160
guarantee it.

43:37.160 --> 43:40.080
But the fact that Google is joining the force.

43:40.080 --> 43:42.820
And Facebook, I think, Facebook too.

43:42.820 --> 43:47.480
And it's going to put a huge dent in Flash and hopefully even kill it.

43:47.480 --> 43:51.120
So I think here, it's pretty obvious, the streaming services are the ones still rely

43:51.120 --> 43:52.120
on Flash.

43:52.120 --> 43:53.120
Yes, yes, yes.

43:53.120 --> 43:57.120
But if you access the streaming services through a mobile phone nowadays, you already see that

43:57.120 --> 43:59.680
they don't really require Flash.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.680
So currently, Flash is there for convenience.

44:01.680 --> 44:09.560
Well, I'll tell you this, unfortunately, so the way it works currently, and man, Alan,

44:09.560 --> 44:11.160
it would be way better explaining this.

44:11.160 --> 44:14.520
He does a great job explaining this.

44:14.520 --> 44:19.400
But the way it works on mobile currently, most of the time, well, I think every time,

44:19.400 --> 44:22.840
it is delivered, live video is delivered via HLS.

44:22.840 --> 44:26.760
And HLS, and I'm sorry, I'm not going to explain this as well as Noah, or I'm sorry, as well

44:26.760 --> 44:27.760
as Alan would.

44:27.760 --> 44:33.160
But HLS, what it essentially does is it takes H.264 video and MP3 or AAC audio, whatever

44:33.160 --> 44:36.840
your audio is, and it wraps it in tiny M3U playlist files.

44:36.840 --> 44:37.840
Yeah, oh, you know how this works?

44:37.840 --> 44:39.640
I've streamed from it before.

44:39.640 --> 44:45.320
So HLS is about as proprietary as it gets, because it's using H.264, and it's really

44:45.320 --> 44:46.320
very clunky.

44:46.320 --> 44:47.320
Yes.

44:47.320 --> 44:50.560
Because what the player is doing on the other end is it's constantly cycling the playlist

44:50.560 --> 44:51.560
files.

44:51.560 --> 44:52.560
Constantly pinging to download the newest playlist.

44:52.560 --> 44:53.560
Yeah.

44:53.560 --> 44:54.560
It's pulling the playlist file, pulling the playlist file, and then loading that into

44:54.560 --> 44:56.560
the player, and playing it as fast as it can, and pulling down the playlist file and loading

44:56.560 --> 44:59.160
it into the player, and playing it as fast as it can, and it's really dumb.

44:59.160 --> 45:00.160
Yes.

45:00.160 --> 45:01.160
And easy to lose the stream too.

45:01.160 --> 45:02.160
Yes.

45:02.160 --> 45:04.520
And so you get, and on a mobile, you get a little hiccup there, and you know, you lose

45:04.520 --> 45:08.300
some of that playlist file, one of the playlist files, and you just drop the whole stream.

45:08.300 --> 45:14.480
And so we don't really have a solid, ready to go live Flash replacement yet.

45:14.480 --> 45:18.540
And anybody who watches this show in VLC sometimes notices that MPV handles it a little bit better,

45:18.540 --> 45:19.540
but yeah.

45:19.540 --> 45:23.720
I honestly used the Flash player when I first started watching, because VLC couldn't keep

45:23.720 --> 45:24.720
up.

45:24.720 --> 45:25.720
It's definitely better now.

45:25.720 --> 45:26.720
Mm-hmm.

45:26.720 --> 45:27.720
But MPV is great too.

45:27.720 --> 45:28.720
Mm-hmm.

45:28.720 --> 45:29.720
I heard somebody, and they're going ahead.

45:29.720 --> 45:31.720
I don't like, I don't like VLC at all.

45:31.720 --> 45:38.200
Actually, I think that its streaming features are so clunky that it gets way more hype than

45:38.200 --> 45:40.680
it deserves on, at least on Linux.

45:40.680 --> 45:43.480
Maybe on Windows there's nothing better, but on Linux there's a lot.

45:43.480 --> 45:44.480
Now Wimby, very true.

45:44.480 --> 45:45.480
I have had not that experience.

45:45.480 --> 45:46.480
Oh, go ahead Daryl.

45:46.480 --> 45:53.000
I was just saying that I have had, I haven't had that experience with, regarding to VLC.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.960
I'm pretty sure that that's a discussion for another show.

45:55.960 --> 45:56.960
Yeah, we could.

45:56.960 --> 45:57.960
Yeah, we could have another.

45:57.960 --> 46:03.160
Wimby, do you, are you joking, or do you really think that if we prematurely kill Flash, which

46:03.160 --> 46:06.280
I can't even believe I'm going to say that, but let's just argue that maybe it's too soon.

46:06.280 --> 46:09.960
If we prematurely killed Flash, do you really think people would jump to another proprietary

46:09.960 --> 46:14.560
alternative like Silverlight, or is it like H.264, are we just going to lock in some other

46:14.560 --> 46:17.000
proprietary garbage if we kill Flash right now?

46:17.000 --> 46:21.680
That was for you, Wimby, if you're still there.

46:21.680 --> 46:24.160
I don't mind proprietary garbage.

46:24.160 --> 46:25.600
Yeah, I am.

46:25.600 --> 46:28.680
I think there's a bit of lag on the line here.

46:28.680 --> 46:31.680
I'm not sure if it's me or someone else anyway.

46:31.680 --> 46:37.120
I'm not sure, I don't mind which proprietary solution people pick so long as it's one that

46:37.120 --> 46:39.240
runs on multiple platforms.

46:39.240 --> 46:44.680
So I don't have a problem with H.264 because Cisco are backing the licenses for that being

46:44.680 --> 46:49.440
embedded into Firefox, for example.

46:49.440 --> 46:54.080
So our rule, Gabe, I'm not pro-proprietary, I'm just pragmatic.

46:54.080 --> 46:58.320
If the only way Linux users are going to have access to premium content which is going to

46:58.320 --> 47:04.440
be DRM encumbered, then at least give us a level playing field so we can all access it.

47:04.440 --> 47:11.840
But there is a new streaming service, a Netflix-alike service in the UK that launched on Silverlight,

47:11.840 --> 47:14.720
and that was only nine months ago.

47:14.720 --> 47:21.640
So yes, there are organizations that still go for Silverlight solutions, even on new

47:21.640 --> 47:22.640
products.

47:22.640 --> 47:23.640
I know, just it's crazy, isn't it?

47:23.640 --> 47:27.400
I would say, I want to take the DRM discussion, I just want to table it, yes, I agree DRM

47:27.400 --> 47:31.000
is bad, and I also agree proprietary garbage is bad.

47:31.000 --> 47:35.600
And if you don't want to watch DRM content and proprietary garbage, the solution isn't

47:35.600 --> 47:40.040
in what the browsers are implementing, the solution is in the customer stop paying for

47:40.040 --> 47:41.580
it and stop watching it.

47:41.580 --> 47:45.980
So if you want DRM to change and you don't want proprietary garbage, you got to change

47:45.980 --> 47:48.400
what you do and let the market follow it.

47:48.400 --> 47:51.280
And that's a hard thing to actually, it's easier said than done when you say something

47:51.280 --> 47:52.280
like that.

47:52.280 --> 47:56.240
But I think that's the silver bullet to DRM, not convincing these companies.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.200
Or just cross-platform proprietary garbage.

47:58.200 --> 47:59.680
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

47:59.680 --> 48:03.680
That gives everybody a chance to at least play, at least until we stop using it.

48:03.680 --> 48:04.680
Yeah, I agree.

48:04.680 --> 48:11.280
I do have to say that potentially in the near future, the new copyright directive on the

48:11.280 --> 48:15.880
new level will actually kill DRM with copyright legislation.

48:15.880 --> 48:20.960
Because it's currently seen as breaking the exceptions to copying your private copy.

48:20.960 --> 48:22.960
So it will have to be dropped.

48:22.960 --> 48:25.120
That'll be fascinating to watch.

48:25.120 --> 48:26.120
Thanks guys.

48:26.120 --> 48:31.920
All right, so let's shift gears and talk about this gentleman who was a hardcore KDE user.

48:31.920 --> 48:34.760
And he tried out Gnome for a week and then wrote up about it.

48:34.760 --> 48:38.760
And I saw this article and I thought, oh, here's some clickbait.

48:38.760 --> 48:42.080
And I read through it and I went, that was really well done.

48:42.080 --> 48:43.080
Really articulate.

48:43.080 --> 48:44.380
And I want to talk about it in the show.

48:44.380 --> 48:46.880
And I know we're going to have some different opinions here, but we've got a lot more to

48:46.880 --> 48:47.880
get to.

48:47.880 --> 48:49.160
And then we also got the OpenSUSE to discussion.

48:49.160 --> 48:53.200
So let's take a quick moment and thank our next sponsor, Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com

48:53.200 --> 48:54.200
slash unplugged.

48:54.200 --> 48:56.920
Go there, get our 33% Linux discount.

48:56.920 --> 49:00.880
Linux Academy is a platform set up by people who are truly passionate about Linux and open

49:00.880 --> 49:01.880
source.

49:01.880 --> 49:02.920
And they really follow the content.

49:02.920 --> 49:03.920
They really follow the material.

49:03.920 --> 49:06.360
And they've got step-by-step video courses to help you learn.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.800
They've got downloadable comprehensive study guides.

49:08.800 --> 49:10.240
The courseware comes with its own server.

49:10.240 --> 49:12.240
It spins it up in the lab for you on demand.

49:12.240 --> 49:14.400
The seven plus distributions you get to choose from.

49:14.400 --> 49:16.640
Refresh topics that you care about all the time.

49:16.640 --> 49:19.000
Docker, OpenStack, virtualization.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.780
All of the technology around Linux as well.

49:21.780 --> 49:27.300
Everything from like Ruby on Rails development to Android development to Linux basics.

49:27.300 --> 49:30.160
They've got over 1500 self-paced courses.

49:30.160 --> 49:31.640
And I love the way the interface works.

49:31.640 --> 49:34.720
You log in, you get a great map of how long something's going to take you.

49:34.720 --> 49:36.920
You can download the guide for that before you go jump in.

49:36.920 --> 49:39.920
You can tell they have availability programming, so you can go in there and say, I have this

49:39.920 --> 49:40.920
much time available.

49:40.920 --> 49:44.180
It'll automatically generate courseware that matches your availability.

49:44.180 --> 49:45.680
This is all really high-tech stuff.

49:45.680 --> 49:48.200
And of course, they're using all Linux on the back end too.

49:48.200 --> 49:51.600
Their virtualization platform, I learned a little bit about it when they became a sponsor.

49:51.600 --> 49:52.880
They were just finishing building it out.

49:52.880 --> 49:55.400
It was so, so slick.

49:55.400 --> 49:59.040
There is obviously a passion for the technology over at Linux Academy.

49:59.040 --> 50:02.560
And I think that when you're learning from somebody, that passion truly makes a difference.

50:02.560 --> 50:04.880
It's almost like CG in a movie.

50:04.880 --> 50:08.480
When you look at a CG character, you're like, oh, boy, that Uncanny Valley, that is just

50:08.480 --> 50:11.280
enough creepy that it's not a real thing.

50:11.280 --> 50:14.520
That's how I feel like a lot of these online training course systems are.

50:14.520 --> 50:18.440
It's real close, except for, well, they needed to have a couple of check boxes in the Linux

50:18.440 --> 50:19.440
and open source.

50:19.440 --> 50:20.440
Let's get the Apache course in here.

50:20.440 --> 50:21.480
Let's get the Linux course in here.

50:21.480 --> 50:22.480
Let's get the engine.

50:22.480 --> 50:23.600
They check the boxes.

50:23.600 --> 50:26.300
And that's their commitment to Linux and open source.

50:26.300 --> 50:27.800
That's not Linux Academy.

50:27.800 --> 50:30.720
Linux Academy is truly people passionate about this stuff.

50:30.720 --> 50:33.060
And that closes that Uncanny Valley gap.

50:33.060 --> 50:34.060
That makes it real.

50:34.060 --> 50:36.820
That makes it people that are truly living it and breathe it and trust it.

50:36.820 --> 50:38.800
And that's what they base their life around.

50:38.800 --> 50:39.900
And that's who you want to learn from.

50:39.900 --> 50:43.580
That's why you listen to podcasts made by people who truly love Linux and not a podcast

50:43.580 --> 50:45.600
made by Engadget talking about Linux.

50:45.600 --> 50:46.600
That would be awful.

50:46.600 --> 50:47.600
Right?

50:47.600 --> 50:50.480
It's that same kind of disconnect and that big difference in that closing the gap that

50:50.480 --> 50:51.560
Linux Academy makes.

50:51.560 --> 50:54.560
They just refreshed their OpenStack course where they just really updated the Red Hat

50:54.560 --> 50:55.560
certified stuff.

50:55.560 --> 50:56.560
It's great.

Also, shoot, while you're over there, see if they've updated any of their nuggets.

51:07.280 --> 51:09.400
I think these nuggets are the greatest thing ever.

51:09.400 --> 51:11.720
Oh, look at this one.

51:11.720 --> 51:15.280
So these nuggets are like anywhere from like two minutes to 16 minute like deep dive on

51:15.280 --> 51:18.720
courses that just show you like, hey, you want to know how to do X?

51:18.720 --> 51:19.720
Just do this.

51:19.720 --> 51:20.720
Well, look at this one.

51:20.720 --> 51:21.720
Video conversions on the command line with Handbrake.

51:21.720 --> 51:22.720
Oh, that's awesome.

51:22.720 --> 51:23.720
That's great.

51:23.720 --> 51:24.720
Right?

51:24.720 --> 51:25.720
VirtualBox.

51:25.720 --> 51:26.720
Start a headless VM on boot.

51:26.720 --> 51:27.720
That's genius.

51:27.720 --> 51:28.720
They got some AWS stuff in here.

51:28.720 --> 51:30.840
They got building a firewall with IP tables.

51:30.840 --> 51:32.240
Just go deep dive on a topic.

51:32.240 --> 51:33.240
Right?

51:33.240 --> 51:34.240
Just dig in.

51:34.240 --> 51:35.240
You know, it doesn't feel like a lecture.

51:35.240 --> 51:37.040
It feels like a new toy that you've just got.

51:37.040 --> 51:38.040
Right?

51:38.040 --> 51:39.040
Exactly.

51:39.040 --> 51:40.040
I love it.

51:40.040 --> 51:43.220
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged and support the Linux unplugged program.

51:43.220 --> 51:44.220
It's a really good setup.

51:44.220 --> 51:48.460
And I also just I love that they've built it around the Linux environment in such a

51:48.460 --> 51:50.040
cool way with those virtual servers.

51:50.040 --> 51:52.160
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

51:52.160 --> 51:54.200
OK, guys.

51:54.200 --> 51:56.480
So I couldn't believe it.

51:56.480 --> 51:59.440
I thought for sure there was no way I was going to get sucked into this article, but

51:59.440 --> 52:00.440
I did.

52:00.440 --> 52:03.680
A week with Gnome as my main Linux desktop, what they get right and what they got wrong.

52:03.680 --> 52:06.240
And I'm just going to read a couple of bits from it and then we'll get into discussion

52:06.240 --> 52:07.240
here.

52:07.240 --> 52:10.840
It says, yeah, I know I have a couple of points I want to touch on, but let's start on the

52:10.840 --> 52:11.840
article itself.

52:11.840 --> 52:16.880
An important distinction between KD and Gnome, the author writes, Gnome feels like a product.

52:16.880 --> 52:19.080
It feels like a singular experience.

52:19.080 --> 52:25.540
When you use it, it feels complete and that everything you need is at your fingertips.

52:25.540 --> 52:32.320
It feels like the Linux desktop in the same way Windows or OS 10 have the desktop experience.

52:32.320 --> 52:36.480
What you need is there and it's all written by the same guys working towards the same

52:36.480 --> 52:37.880
team goal.

52:37.880 --> 52:40.240
It feels like the Linux desktop.

52:40.240 --> 52:42.840
Now, Wes, KD, Gnome user?

52:42.840 --> 52:43.840
Gnome user myself.

52:43.840 --> 52:44.840
Do you agree?

52:44.840 --> 52:47.400
Does Gnome feel more like a Linux complete desktop to you?

52:47.400 --> 52:50.760
Well, you know, I think what we were talking about earlier, a lot of things Qt does feel

52:50.760 --> 52:52.800
much more, you know, wider world.

52:52.800 --> 52:54.200
It runs on so many things.

52:54.200 --> 52:56.360
I really love the framework and to code with it.

52:56.360 --> 52:59.040
Maybe not so much GTK.

52:59.040 --> 53:02.480
But you're right, Gnome really fits in with Linux, you know, especially the hardcore support

53:02.480 --> 53:06.120
that they get from Fedora, how well integrated it is.

53:06.120 --> 53:07.120
Sits right on top of system D.

53:07.120 --> 53:08.120
Exactly.

53:08.120 --> 53:09.120
Yeah.

53:09.120 --> 53:12.840
So, the author spent five days of his week logging into Gnome manually, not turning on

53:12.840 --> 53:13.840
automatic login.

53:13.840 --> 53:15.360
And I love this observation.

53:15.360 --> 53:17.040
It's the small things in Gnome.

53:17.040 --> 53:18.040
It really is.

53:18.040 --> 53:21.920
In fact, the alternative article title was a cut, a death by a thousand paper cuts for

53:21.920 --> 53:22.920
KDE.

53:22.920 --> 53:26.840
Here's like an example of something that bugs me under KDE that I like under Gnome.

53:26.840 --> 53:28.200
And it's like this times a hundred.

53:28.200 --> 53:31.400
He says, I spent the first five days of my week logging into Gnome manually, not turning

53:31.400 --> 53:32.960
on automatic login.

53:32.960 --> 53:36.220
On the night of the fifth day, I got annoyed with having to login by hand and so I went

53:36.220 --> 53:39.320
into the user manager and turned on automatic login.

53:39.320 --> 53:41.960
The next time I logged in, I got a prompt.

53:41.960 --> 53:43.640
Your key chain was not unlocked.

53:43.640 --> 53:46.400
Please enter your password to unlock your key chain.

53:46.400 --> 53:48.520
That's when I realized something.

53:48.520 --> 53:53.160
Gnome had been automatically unlocking my key chain, my wallet in KDE speak, every time

53:53.160 --> 53:55.100
I logged in via GDM.

53:55.100 --> 53:59.640
It was only when I bypassed GDM's login that Gnome had to step up and make it do me do

53:59.640 --> 54:00.640
it manually.

54:00.640 --> 54:05.860
It was at that moment I realized something simple, something that made the desktop feel

54:05.860 --> 54:08.120
like it was working with me.

54:08.120 --> 54:14.840
When I log into KDE via SSDDM, before the splash screen is even finished loading, there

54:14.840 --> 54:20.480
is a pop-up over that splash screen animation, thereby disturbing that splash screen, prompting

54:20.480 --> 54:23.360
me to unlock my KDE wallet or GPG key ring.

54:23.360 --> 54:26.160
And then it goes into the dysfunctions in creating those.

54:26.160 --> 54:29.800
And I thought that was an interesting point.

54:29.800 --> 54:32.480
It is the small things about KDE that bugged me.

54:32.480 --> 54:37.160
He also talks about the login manager and the way that looks, but this point, this KDE,

54:37.160 --> 54:40.080
when you log into the KDE desktop and you have to unlock your wallet and this dialog

54:40.080 --> 54:44.500
box pops up before you've even finished logging into your desktop, it just feels disoriented.

54:44.500 --> 54:45.500
It feels jumbled.

54:45.500 --> 54:46.500
It feels disconnected.

54:46.500 --> 54:47.500
It feels jumbled.

54:47.500 --> 54:48.500
Which is a big criticism of Linux in general, right?

54:48.500 --> 54:49.500
Yes.

54:49.500 --> 54:50.500
A hodgepodge of different tools.

54:50.500 --> 54:51.500
Gnome doesn't feel that way.

54:51.500 --> 54:52.500
Here's another hodgepodge.

54:52.500 --> 54:53.500
Software manager.

54:53.500 --> 54:55.240
Something that's been seeing a lot of push in the recent years and will likely see a

54:55.240 --> 54:56.880
bigger push in months to come.

54:56.880 --> 55:01.520
Unfortunately, it's an area where KDE gets close, but then fell on its face.

55:01.520 --> 55:04.480
Gnome Software is now his new favorite software center, minus one gripe.

55:04.480 --> 55:08.080
But Muon, which is the KDE one, it's a design nightmare.

55:08.080 --> 55:11.000
And he's got some examples in here.

55:11.000 --> 55:13.320
I'm not bashing KDE, but he's right.

55:13.320 --> 55:16.400
There are, there are, there are wiggles in the software center, like the fact that the

55:16.400 --> 55:21.160
updates in software and two different applications, the fact that software discovery is a total,

55:21.160 --> 55:25.600
like you look at this, it is, and what's really kind of a tragedy about it, and he goes on

55:25.600 --> 55:28.800
to point this out, is that KDE knows about this.

55:28.800 --> 55:30.960
That's why they created the visual design group.

55:30.960 --> 55:34.320
And the visual design group had mock-ups for the software center that looked totally different

55:34.320 --> 55:35.320
than what shipped.

55:35.320 --> 55:36.320
Wow.

55:36.320 --> 55:38.640
He says someone must have gotten drunk when they coded the UI.

55:38.640 --> 55:40.400
That's the only guess he has.

55:40.400 --> 55:42.380
And then I'm gonna, and then we're almost done and we'll get to jump in, but I just

55:42.380 --> 55:43.960
want to get through his major points here.

55:43.960 --> 55:47.800
When we bring up an important distinction between KDE and GNOME, GNOME feels like a

55:47.800 --> 55:48.800
product, right?

55:48.800 --> 55:49.800
That's what he says.

55:49.800 --> 55:50.800
It feels like a product.

55:50.800 --> 55:52.760
But KDE, that doesn't, KDE doesn't feel like a cohesive experience.

55:52.760 --> 55:55.680
He says KDE doesn't feel like it has a direction it's moving on.

55:55.680 --> 55:57.200
It doesn't feel like it's a full experience.

55:57.200 --> 56:00.680
KDE feels like it's a bunch of pieces that are moving in a bunch of different directions

56:00.680 --> 56:03.560
that just happen to have a shared toolkit beneath them.

56:03.560 --> 56:04.560
Right.

56:04.560 --> 56:08.320
I think this speaks a lot to what we see in general, where, you know, a lot of people

56:08.320 --> 56:12.660
gripe about GNOME, lose customization, all that kind of stuff, and I think there's very

56:12.660 --> 56:14.520
diverse camps within the Linux group.

56:14.520 --> 56:17.120
Some people want to be able to tinker, they want, they're okay if it doesn't work for

56:17.120 --> 56:19.440
the first 10 hours, but afterwards it works great.

56:19.440 --> 56:22.800
But GNOME really does feel like a product where it's been integrated, it's been considered,

56:22.800 --> 56:23.800
it's been designed.

56:23.800 --> 56:26.160
And it looks like, you know, you feel like a lot of elements were painstakingly thought

56:26.160 --> 56:27.160
about.

56:27.160 --> 56:28.160
Exactly.

56:28.160 --> 56:30.080
He says, so then I thought this was a final conclusion here, and you'll have the whole

56:30.080 --> 56:33.040
article linked in the show notes, which is a good read with lots of good screenshot examples.

56:33.040 --> 56:36.560
He says, well, I still use GNOME after this week.

56:36.560 --> 56:38.100
Probably not, no.

56:38.100 --> 56:41.960
GNOME is still trying to force a workflow on me that I don't follow or abide by.

56:41.960 --> 56:45.920
I feel less productive when using it because it doesn't follow my paradigm.

56:45.920 --> 56:48.540
So at the end of all of this, he's not switching back to GNOME.

56:48.540 --> 56:53.040
But this hit a lot of pieces for me, and Rotten, do you want to open up, because I know you

56:53.040 --> 56:55.680
just mentioned at the top of the show that you've been running KDE for a little while

56:55.680 --> 57:01.160
now, and as you switched from GNOME to KDE, do you detect this sort of, I thought this

57:01.160 --> 57:04.980
line that he put here, a bunch of different moving software pieces and going in different

57:04.980 --> 57:09.240
directions that use the same shared toolkit beneath them, that really struck a chord with

57:09.240 --> 57:10.240
me when I think of KDE.

57:10.240 --> 57:15.240
It's like, everything does talk super well together, but at the same time, it is a bit

57:15.240 --> 57:20.080
of a mess in terms of jumbled together, like, man, look at the sound.

57:20.080 --> 57:21.400
You go look at the sound settings, right?

57:21.400 --> 57:25.280
When you're looking at the sound settings in KDE, don't you think it's really bizarre

57:25.280 --> 57:28.920
that they have, in fact, he has a screenshot.

57:28.920 --> 57:34.640
So here's a screenshot right here of GNOME sound versus KDE sound.

57:34.640 --> 57:39.680
Now here is what blows me away about KDE sound, the sound settings.

57:39.680 --> 57:43.440
You see what's at the very top of the GNOME, what's that very top slider right there, Wes?

57:43.440 --> 57:44.440
What is that right there?

57:44.440 --> 57:45.440
Output volume.

57:45.440 --> 57:46.440
That's the output volume.

57:46.440 --> 57:50.040
You know what's missing completely from the KDE sound applet?

57:50.040 --> 57:52.120
There is no effing volume slider.

57:52.120 --> 57:53.560
But you know what there is?

57:53.560 --> 57:58.840
There is a left-hand list of device priorities for application notifications, music, video

57:58.840 --> 58:02.680
communications, audio recording, video recording, and in each one of these categories, I can

58:02.680 --> 58:05.000
move around which sound card takes priority.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.880
Pretty neat feature.

58:06.880 --> 58:10.720
Probably not used as often as the volume slider in the volume control panel, though.

58:10.720 --> 58:11.720
Ten to one right there, yeah.

58:11.720 --> 58:12.720
Right.

58:12.720 --> 58:13.720
This is what I'm talking about.

58:13.720 --> 58:15.240
What kind of sense does that make?

58:15.240 --> 58:19.760
For developers and advanced users, that's a really slick feature, and I bet even advanced

58:19.760 --> 58:23.680
users and developers set that once or twice when they set up the KDE desktop, and they

58:23.680 --> 58:25.520
never go back and change that priority list.

58:25.520 --> 58:27.160
I never mess with that priority list.

58:27.160 --> 58:29.920
I just want to set my default audio device and set the volume.

58:29.920 --> 58:31.360
I just want to do two things.

58:31.360 --> 58:36.400
And this Gnome system lets me set my output device and set the volume right there.

58:36.400 --> 58:38.160
And it's like that everywhere.

58:38.160 --> 58:39.640
The defaults are crazy in KDE.

58:39.640 --> 58:44.120
Now, Rotten, have you noticed this as you've moved over from Gnome to KDE or to you?

58:44.120 --> 58:47.120
Is it refreshing in a sense?

58:47.120 --> 58:49.200
As far as the way the cohesiveness of KDE?

58:49.200 --> 58:50.200
Yeah.

58:50.200 --> 58:52.840
Does it feel like a bunch of different stuff just share the same toolkit?

58:52.840 --> 58:53.840
No.

58:53.840 --> 58:56.840
I mean, it feels like a cohesive unit.

58:56.840 --> 59:00.760
It's just a messy cohesion.

59:00.760 --> 59:05.280
The example of the sound slider does exist in KDE.

59:05.280 --> 59:07.020
It's just not in the settings section.

59:07.020 --> 59:13.480
It's in the applet that's on the panel, or the taskbar, as they call it, which is fine.

59:13.480 --> 59:16.160
You would say, well, these are settings, so you want to change the different devices and

59:16.160 --> 59:17.160
stuff like that.

59:17.160 --> 59:23.200
So it's nice, and it's more polished the way Gnome does it, but it's not necessarily a

59:23.200 --> 59:27.760
complete necessity for KDE to do that way because they already give you the slider,

59:27.760 --> 59:33.400
and KMix gives you a ton of control over the different sliders for the different applications

59:33.400 --> 59:36.360
and the different outputs and stuff like that.

59:36.360 --> 59:39.880
It's really nice because it's all right in that one widget, so you don't have to open

59:39.880 --> 59:40.880
up.

59:40.880 --> 59:45.320
For example, if you want to change stuff based on a particular application or a particular

59:45.320 --> 59:49.560
output for, say, a plug-in that you have two different YouTube channels playing.

59:49.560 --> 59:53.840
Yeah, that's neat, but why not – okay, so this is a use case scenario.

59:53.840 --> 59:54.840
Let's be honest.

59:54.840 --> 59:55.840
How many people are doing this?

59:55.840 --> 59:56.840
Probably not very.

59:56.840 --> 59:59.120
I mean, people that could do that could just install Poova control.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:08.280
Yeah, but my point is that if you have – it's not really that polished if the aspects of

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:11.880
what you want to do are available in KDE, but they're not available at all in Gnome.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:12.880
I would say –

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.880
And then vice versa, the same kind of thing.

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:14.880
I would disagree.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:21.320
I think what they have struck is such an imbalance between polish and options that it's a mess.

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:25.840
It's not polished at all, and I think if – yes, there is a sound slider –

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.320
Gnome is the polished one.

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.320
Yeah, okay.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:34.840
Well, that – I just – I think it is a little – the sound settings here is a little

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:35.920
indicative of the whole problem.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:40.840
I know there's a sound slider in the menu bar, but every other desktop environment – literally

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:46.440
made every other desktop environment, like Windows and OS X included in that, have the

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:49.960
slider there for a very good reason, because when you're changing your different output

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:53.160
devices and you're changing your different alert settings, you want to be able to adjust

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.040
the volume to see what – I do this all the time.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.840
This is a very, very common function, and it just makes sense to have it there.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.840
Anyway –

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:08.120
But to be fair, they're still porting a lot of stuff to 5, and he's showing a screenshot

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:13.560
from Plasma 5, but that's not really a fair screenshot considering that's KDE 4 version

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.060
of that application.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:18.840
So just because that's how it looks in Plasma 5 doesn't mean that's what it's going

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.880
to be when it finally releases the new port.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.440
Well, here's what I was going to ask.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:25.080
It's also true with pretty much most of their applications.

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.080
Does it matter?

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.160
Like, is the KDE approach necessarily wrong?

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.000
It's sort of – I mean, what's the Unix philosophy?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.060
A lot of little tools working together to build something great.

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:38.600
Is that necessarily – if you could have a nice desktop environment, a lot of different

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.680
tools that use a common toolkit and a common design language, which is what the visual

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.080
design group is supposed to be pushing, but it depends on the projects adopted, then is

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.960
that necessarily the wrong approach?

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:52.960
I think a lot of times we see two different approaches to something, and we just assume

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.960
one is right and one is wrong.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.720
I don't necessarily think that's the case.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:02.800
I think, for me, I like – so I said this a long time ago – I really like the fact

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.960
that GNOME feels like the Linux desktop.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:09.240
For some reason, like, from just something about the whole thing, it feels like GNOME

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:14.440
is sitting directly on top of more fundamental Linux technologies than site KDE is.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:19.120
And so, to me, the whole cohesiveness feels like a really good desktop environment.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.560
That's what I want out of my environment.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:23.800
But like Rodden's saying right now, there's a whole other group of people who want those

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:24.800
other things.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:25.800
Doesn't mean that's the wrong approach.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.800
Yeah, definitely.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.680
I think it enriches our ecosystem to have both being actively developed.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.680
Yeah.

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:33.880
Were you going to say Rodden?

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:34.880
No?

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.880
Okay.

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:36.880
Rodden has nothing to that.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:37.880
Actually, I –

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:38.880
Yeah, go ahead.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:39.880
Oh, no, I totally do.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:40.880
I totally do.

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:41.880
I always have something to say.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:50.600
So, I just posted a screenshot in the IRC of KDE – what my KDE looks like now.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:54.040
I'm not done, but you'll see it kind of resembles something, right?

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:57.640
Wow, it looks a lot like GNOME, to be honest with you.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:00.040
Yeah, that was actually the purpose.

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:03.040
Yeah, it looks exactly like GNOME.

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:04.840
Yeah, it does.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:09.560
So the reason why is because I think KDE is atrocious looking.

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:17.160
It is like the default for 5 is actually to the point where it's reasonable to say that

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.560
I might actually try that.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:23.680
But the default for KDE 4, which is the current stable release, is atrocious.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:30.660
So the reason why my KDE looks good and it looks like a lot more cohesiveness is because

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:33.360
I changed a crap load of things.

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.920
I've done that too.

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.840
It just seems like such a waste of energy.

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.760
It almost feels like you used KDE to make a GNOME.

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:42.000
I did, actually.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.080
But my point is that you can take KDE to any direction you want, and that's the power

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.640
of it.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.240
The design group is actually going to fix the overall cohesiveness of it.

01:03:53.240 --> 01:04:01.160
So eventually, it will be a very good solution, but it's not necessarily there yet.

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:04.160
I'm starting to doubt the design group will actually have much influence.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:08.400
I mean, they've had some great influence on the desktop itself, but then other projects

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.040
outside of the Direct Desktop don't really seem to be like Dragon Player, for example,

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.840
or Armor Rock, for example.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:17.320
Not seen a lot of changes there.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.160
They haven't gotten to the point of actually starting to port those.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:26.340
Even Dolphin is one of the most important applications for KDE users, and it's only

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.440
had slightly started the porting process right now.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.440
It's painful.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.840
So they still have a lot of work to do.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:39.840
And it's actually impressive how much work they've done in only like nine months.

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:46.880
They've essentially rewritten like 70% of the code of KDE in order to do Plasma 5, and

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.680
it is very impressive.

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:55.160
It's not ready by any means, but it is getting to the point where you can see the potential

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.160
of it.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:01.280
But Rotten, that's where it's been since before Plasma 5 was even a thing.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:05.800
You talked about one of the, well, there's always been a couple of constants.

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.760
Qt's always been badass, and Kwin's always gotten, well, Kwin's gotten extremely badass,

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:10.760
right?

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:15.780
In fact, Martin's just recently been talking about all the work on his, to get Kwin working

01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:16.780
on Wayland.

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:18.360
It's getting really close.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.360
It's really exciting.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.360
Yeah.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:24.880
Kwin is actually fantastic, and it's more fantastic, people know, because Kwin has this

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:30.760
built-in feature for window rules, which is basically like saving features of how you

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.520
actually lay out your windows.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.680
So if you don't want window decorations, you can turn it off, save that.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:40.560
If you want your windows to be a specific size, specific location on your screen, which

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:44.200
screen you want it to be on, what desktop you want it to be on, different things like

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:48.680
that, you can control it to ridiculous degrees that there are certain settings that I would

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:52.080
never even bother because they're so specific.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:57.480
And the coolest one right now is, 4 does not have it, but Plasma 5 is an example of the

01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:03.920
design group seeing how this is going to be a benefit, is that the window rules in 5 allow

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.600
you to change the colors per application.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.920
But are you, well, okay, that is kind of cool, you're going to do that and I'm like, well,

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:12.880
maybe you would just so it grabs you, yeah, okay, I mean, I love this stuff.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.880
Yeah, exactly.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:17.440
Functionally, KDE is amazing.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:24.680
Visually, right now in 4, it is actually kind of like hurts my eyes most of the time, but

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:28.040
it is getting to the point where they actually have improved the icons, they've improved

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:34.840
the window decorations and they've improved a ton of things and it has potential to eventually,

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:40.520
you know, even visually compete against GNOME, but right now, GNOME is definitely the more

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:46.280
visually appealing, but it's also not as powerful functionally as KDE is, so it depends on which

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.280
one you want.

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:51.920
At the end of the day, I think the big problem, KDE's biggest problem is that there might

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:55.720
be too much desktop for what people really use today.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.320
I think a very common use case scenario for the Linux desktop is a couple of applications

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:03.920
running all the time, like a web browser, a chat program, email probably, and...

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.920
Throw in a terminal, please.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:06.920
Absolutely.

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.000
And you're pretty much done.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.840
And you don't need a lot more functionality from your desk, that's why so many people

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:13.240
are able to use Tiling Window Managers.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.240
Yeah, exactly.

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:18.320
Now, that said, I too, Rotten, have gone down the path you had where I, I mean, I really

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:22.880
spent some time, I got the icon-only launcher sidebar going for a dock, I got a, you know,

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:27.600
a top bar going with the clock, I mean, it really made it look nice, but it just still

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.980
didn't feel as one cohesive product.

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:31.980
But I like...

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:37.240
Well, I mean, I just, I don't think that GNOME feels like a cohesive product that's got certain

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:39.240
pieces that are broken.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:43.800
And just to point out, I'm a GNOME fanboy, I've been using GNOME for a decade, and I

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.840
actually love GNOME Shell and GNOME 3.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:52.580
That is the, the reason why I, my current KDE setup looks like GNOME is because I actually

01:07:52.580 --> 01:07:54.400
enjoy the workflow of GNOME.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.120
So the guy who's wrote that article said he hated that workflow and didn't want it anymore.

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.160
I was like, well, I actually love that workflow.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.160
Yeah, it works for me too.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:04.600
And I will use it on either KDE or GNOME, it doesn't matter, I love that workflow.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:05.600
Yeah, me too.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:12.320
But the point is mainly that if I set up something in KDE, it will remember, it will save it,

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.680
it will do exactly what I tell it to do.

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:20.000
With GNOME, if I tell it to, I have to install an extension in order to get it to load an

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.360
application on a particular workspace, but if I put it on a different monitor, it won't

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:26.360
remember that monitor.

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.360
Yeah, that drives me crazy.

01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:28.360
I have to move everything.

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.520
I know, I know, I agree, I agree.

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.480
And Dolphin, in my opinion, Dolphin is a better file manager than Nautilus too, in my opinion.

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:37.680
I would say Dolphin is the better for Linux, just in general.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:38.680
So that's, that's, that's.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.000
Gosh, you're kind of making me want to try KDE out for like a week again.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Kind of making me.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.920
I'm actually, I'm kind, I'm actually kind of feeling dirty about saying all this stuff

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:49.040
as a GNOME fanboy.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:55.520
I even, I've released, I actually like released updates and patches to extensions for GNOME

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.480
because I use them and someone didn't, wasn't maintaining it, so I started maintaining it

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:00.480
and stuff like that.

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:05.480
And I still do it even while I'm running KDE, so it's, it makes me feel a little weird,

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:11.480
but I have to acknowledge the fantastic features that KDE provides.

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.480
I agree.

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.480
Yeah.

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:14.480
Yeah.

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.480
And you've made it look pretty good.

01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.040
It didn't take so much effort to make it look good.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.040
Exactly.

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:23.840
If it didn't take so much effort to do that, it would be a fantastic desktop environment.

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.840
How long do you think it took you?

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.760
How long do you think you spent?

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.360
To actually make it look right?

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:32.800
Well, for me, it's not fair to comparison the time.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:36.960
For other people, it would take a lot longer because I'm a graphics artist.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:42.720
I know how to modify SVGs and everything like that, which, by the way, KDE is dependent

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.440
on SVGs for the desktop shells themes.

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:50.380
So if you don't know how to do that, you're pretty much hopeless if, I mean, it is hopeless

01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:56.000
for you to do it because you have to learn how to modify SAGs to do that.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.800
But you have to figure out what app, what widgets fit and what, but like the very first

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.640
time I did it, it took me probably about a week and a half.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:09.520
And this time it took me about two or three days because I had to first teach myself how

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:12.840
does KDE do all these different things.

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:21.120
And it was a lot more effort than I expected, but it was still possible to do it.

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:25.680
But I think the majority of people who don't have the skill set I do would not have as

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.440
fast of an experience.

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:31.040
And even though it's not, it's still a couple of days and it's not fast, I think it would

01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.920
be much worse for them.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:37.280
Yeah, it took me a couple of days to get it the way I want, I might, gosh, dang it.

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.280
Hmm.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:42.520
I'm going to have to install it again, I'm going to have to give it a go.

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:48.320
I can show you another, I actually have like a whole, the very first time I made my Gnome

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.480
like KDE set up, it looked different than what I have now.

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:56.540
But I did like a full layout of like, here's a screenshot of here's what it looks like

01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:57.880
in here because I finished it.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:59.480
It took me about a week and a half.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.480
I don't know what I get.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.560
I mean, Gnome works for me and I don't have sound issues.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.560
That's what I keep coming back to.

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:04.560
But I want to try it.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.280
I keep wanting to, when I try KDE for you for a little while, I usually really enjoy

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.280
it.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.280
So.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:12.200
Here's the other, here's one of the first, last thing I'll say, the reason why I actually

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:19.680
got really annoyed at Gnome and I love Gnome, I got really annoyed by multiple monitor support.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.680
Yeah.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:26.040
Because it is, it is like, not only does it not remember the applications where they're

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:31.840
supposed to be, it actually wouldn't remember which one I wanted to be primary.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.560
And it would, it would start breaking in the point where one monitor would want to take

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.720
over to the primary and then it would switch, swap back and forth, like weird things started

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:41.720
happening.

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:45.480
But so it just, it got so, it happened so many times that it just, I just kind of threw

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.480
my hands up.

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.920
I was like, well, let's see how KDE handles multiple monitors.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:51.640
And I haven't had a single problem with it at all.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.640
Yeah.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:57.320
We were talking at lunch, KDE does have pretty good monitor control and yeah, all right Rod

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.320
and you convinced me.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.620
Anybody else in the member room want to jump in on the topic of Gnome versus KDE when they

01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:01.620
switch between?

01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:02.620
Any final thoughts?

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:04.200
I really want to recommend everybody go read the article.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.200
I thought it was a particularly good one though.

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.200
All right.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.200
Going once, going twice.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.200
All right.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:15.440
Chris, I think as you mentioned before, there's definitely a spectrum from the bare bones

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:21.920
Gnome, very polished, but not a lot of options to KDE with all of its options.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:29.280
I'm curious to see over the last year or so that Gnome has, the Gnome community has kind

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.560
of come back or learned their lesson from the initial Gnome three days.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.640
Well, I hope so.

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:41.840
So I'm curious to see as time goes on if Gnome plus extensions are going to continue to be

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:47.600
supported enough to eat into the user base of KDE users that want all the options.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.600
Yeah.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.600
I mean-

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.860
The extensions are actually very solid.

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:53.800
This is actually a misconception I'd like to clear up about the Gnome extensions because

01:12:53.800 --> 01:13:00.320
I've been maintaining some and this is just, it's a problem with the Gnome version software

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:05.160
checking that it doesn't do it very well and it doesn't have like, for example, Firefox

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.900
does a much better solution.

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:10.000
It's this version plus future versions.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.540
With Gnome, it's this version or nothing.

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:18.140
So if it doesn't detect in your, just your metadata that you are using that particular

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:21.040
version you are currently on, it just breaks the extension.

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:27.320
That's a really bad way to do it, but that's their current solution for making sure that

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.980
you're not running stuff that's broken.

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:33.180
So people think that every single time you update, you're breaking an extension when

01:13:33.180 --> 01:13:36.520
really it's just because the version number is not telling and it's the right one.

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:41.380
If you just go in and change that version number, almost like 90% of them work immediately.

01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:45.280
And also means most of them, it's a quick update by the author to make it work too.

01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.280
So that's been happening.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.920
It's getting turned around immediately these days.

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:50.880
Like that plugin is getting fixed all the time.

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:55.160
Now Wes, have you noticed a change in tone towards Gnome 3 in the Linux community?

01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:56.160
Yeah, I would think so.

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.880
I mean, probably two years ago, a year and a half ago, mostly negative.

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:00.880
Yeah, right?

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:01.880
At least in, you know, publicly facing discussion.

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:02.880
Yeah, okay.

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:03.880
That's what I observed too.

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.880
But now it feels like, you know, it may not be everyone's favorite, it may not be what

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:07.880
you use.

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.480
You know, I usually use a tiling window manager at home, honestly, but I'm always happy to

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.640
stick Gnome on something and use it.

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:14.640
Yeah.

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:15.640
What's your favorite tiling window manager?

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.200
I'm using Awesome currently.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.200
Nice.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.200
Interesting.

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:24.000
I think I'm going to try KD on a secondary machine, but I'm not planning to switch away

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.400
from Gnome anytime soon.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:28.000
I just keep getting happier and happier with it.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.320
Probably just about in time to start hearing about the next Gnome 3.18 release too, which

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:32.320
could be pretty cool.

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.320
All right.

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:35.800
Well, if you guys have any thoughts on that story, we'd love to get your opinions, especially

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.120
if you've been recently trying one of the other desktops and have a good perspective.

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:42.960
Go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com and look for the feedback thread for episode 101 of

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.480
the unplugged program.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.480
Now on Sunday's Linux action show, we talked about the big changes coming to this open

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:52.800
SUSE project, and I know several people wanted to give us some feedback on that.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:57.040
Before we get to that, I've got to thank DigitalOcean, sponsor of the Linux Unplugged Program, and

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.640
DigitalOcean is great.

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.320
If you want some Linux infrastructure right now on demand for testing or production, check

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.320
them out.

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:05.680
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:10.600
easy way for you to spin up your own cloud server, and they have fantastic Docker support

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:14.920
on their droplets, so you can create a nice local container, get a system all set up on

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:17.720
your laptop or your desktop and push it up to the DigitalOcean cloud.

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:18.800
No problem at all.

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:22.400
And here's the best part, you know, you could do that and save yourself a ton of time, but

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:25.920
if you just want to create a server from scratch, it's amazing.

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:29.320
You can get started in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans are only $5, that's where

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:30.320
they start, $5 a month.

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:34.000
Then the pricing structure goes up from there, really nice, makes a lot of sense, and they

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.120
even have hourly pricing available if you just want to do some testing.

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:41.120
For $5 though, you're going to get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, because they're

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:45.060
all SSDs, one CPU and a terabyte, a terabyte of transfer.

01:15:45.060 --> 01:15:48.720
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:53.280
and London, and they've got a brand new one in Germany, which is a great location.

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:57.640
Now what I love is all of this is backed by Linux, it's all running on top of KVM and

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:01.520
all of the disks are SSD based, so you're going to get really, really good performance.

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:04.640
You log into DigitalOcean's interface, it works on your tablet, it works on your phone,

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:08.300
it works on your desktop, you get HTML5 console access, so if you want to watch the machine

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:11.160
post and all the way up to the login screen, you can do that.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.760
It is a slick system.

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:16.160
They've really taken the best open source Linux technologies and wrapped it around in

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:19.520
a package that makes it very presentable and very easy for you to use.

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.520
And I don't know if you've ever tried it, Wes.

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:21.520
Oh yeah, definitely.

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:22.520
Oh yeah?

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:23.520
Oh, of course.

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:26.480
So one of the things I love about DigitalOcean is it's like I know that if I want to go over

01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:30.240
and start getting working on something, the delay isn't going to be the creating the server,

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:33.380
deploying the software, like that's no longer the barrier anymore.

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:37.640
Getting started on that stuff, which 10 years ago was like a two week process to order the

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:40.520
server and install the operating system, configure the firewall, rack it.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.080
Wait for the ticket to get updated.

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:43.080
Yes, right.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.760
Talk to support.

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:48.280
And now with DigitalOcean, you go over there and it's like, well, it's under a minute.

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:52.000
You have a Linux virtual machine deployed and if you use our promo code DOUNPLUGED, you'll

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.820
get a $10 credit and you can try out the $5 rig two months for free.

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:58.560
And you can do one click deployment of applications.

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:02.080
Like I've done one click deployment of Ubuntu 14.04 with Apache already just ready to go

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.080
on there.

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.080
So I don't have to bother with that.

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.380
And the nice thing is it's already subscribed to the repo, so it's going to get all the

01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:07.840
updates from Ubuntu.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:11.720
And I'll do local mirrors of the Ubuntu repos too, so you can pull it down at like tens

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:12.720
of megabytes a second.

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:13.720
It's crazy.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:14.720
It's so cool to watch that.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.400
I love watching the updates go boom, boom, boom, boom, like, yeah, that, it feels like

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.640
it's supercharged.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.700
Their interface is so great for managing all this.

01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:21.700
Very intuitive.

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:24.320
But the best part is they have an API to let you replicate it, which is really nice.

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.000
There's some great apps around that.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.760
They have really, really good tutorials too.

01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.120
In fact, go over to DigitalOcean.

01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:31.240
Remember, use the promo code DOUNPLUGED.

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:33.400
Check out that community section.

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:34.560
They're updating this all the time.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:38.480
Like here's one, how to update the scaling of your web application on DigitalOcean.

01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.360
That's genius when you think about the fact that DigitalOcean is hourly pricing, so if

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.400
you need to scale for a little while, ooh, that's cool.

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.560
Oh, buddy, buddy, buddy, I've been waiting for this one.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:49.560
How to create a blog with Ghost and NGINX on Ubuntu 14.04.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:50.560
This is it.

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:53.560
If you're going to do a blog for yourself or for your company, WordPress is great.

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:55.000
Mad props to WordPress.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Check out Ghost.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.280
And they have a community tutorial on it right here, or how to use a Rango DB.

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:01.880
Are you familiar with a Rango?

01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:02.880
I am not.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:03.880
I don't know what a Rango is.

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:05.040
I like how it has avocados as it's a...

01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.840
I know where we can learn more though.

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:07.840
Yes, exactly.

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:11.520
DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:16.760
They've also got FreeBSD if you're a masochist, CoreOS, Fedora 22, Debian, Ubuntu.

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:17.760
I'm kidding about the FreeBSD thing.

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:18.760
I think it's really cool.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:19.760
They have support for it.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:22.480
It's actually no technical joke either.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.560
They got that working in KVM.

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.600
They worked upstream with the FreeBSD project.

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:27.680
Same with CoreOS too.

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.820
They worked directly with the project to make this stuff happen.

01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:30.820
It's really cool.

01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:34.480
And you can try it out two months for free when you use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:35.480
Go get yourself a Linux rig.

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.480
You want to try de-Google-fying your life for a little while?

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:40.440
Maybe you want to do an own cloud instance or maybe you want to see if you can host your

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.120
own photo gallery or maybe you want your own mumble chat server.

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.520
Set up your own lug.

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.000
You do it all on a DigitalOcean droplet, DigitalOcean.com.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.240
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED and a big, big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.600
the Unplugged program.

01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.600
All right.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.280
So this was the basic feedback we got from Sunday's show.

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:02.160
One lost user wrote, I don't really get why Chris and Noah are puzzled by SUSE and what

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:03.760
OpenSUSE intend to do.

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:09.520
The new distro will be SUSE Linux Enterprise to what CentOS is to Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:11.920
There will be Tumbleweed, the bleeding edge, always rolling distro.

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:16.120
They'll be in much better shape than Rawhide because OpenSUSE actually expects people to

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:20.200
use it as a desktop OS as opposed to Rawhide is always borkin'.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:24.720
There will be OpenSUSE 42 which is going to be based on SUSE Linux Enterprise sources.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:28.080
People will be able to use it as such others do with like CentOS.

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:34.200
It'll be extremely easy for OpenSUSE and SUSE to switch between 42 to switch to the Enterprise

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:35.200
version of back and forth.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:38.280
It looks like a very smart move, he believes.

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:41.280
Now Rotten, you were watching live and we covered it and you said you wanted to jump

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.960
in on the feedback so I'll open it up to you first and then we'll kick around to other

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:44.960
people.

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:49.080
Rotten, what was your main takeaway from the coverage and your opinion on the setup?

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:53.000
Well, the first thing is that this guy is wrong.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.440
The guy who you just read wrote in, that's wrong.

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.440
It's not a CentOS to Red Hat.

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:58.440
I agree with that too.

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:01.600
I don't think it really is a CentOS to Red Hat Enterprise thing either.

01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:06.920
So basically what they're saying, they even specifically were asked if they did this,

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:12.680
was OpenSUSE going to become like an OpenSLE thing and they said no, definitely not.

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:17.160
They're going to be doing, their OpenSUSE is just going to be based on SLE so it's going

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:23.200
to have all the same packages for SLE but it's not going to have the, you know, it's

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.200
not going to be the exact same thing.

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:29.200
They're going to have SLE packages plus their own packages to create the OpenSUSE desktop.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:34.240
The goal was to have like an integration with SUSE and OpenSUSE which they didn't used to

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.240
have.

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:37.400
There was a huge gap between the two.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:42.800
But also, sorry, my dog's actually drinking water.

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:44.800
Yeah, I know.

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:45.800
That's all right.

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:51.420
So we got a lot of different feedback, Rotten, on it and some people like this a lot.

01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:55.640
So here was a response we got from R Brown from SUSE.

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:57.720
He says something like this is what he wanted to do.

01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:58.720
He gave us a couple of links.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:03.480
He says, what we realized is we were building here doesn't fit into traditional models anymore.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:08.600
We find that for us that we're not really serving the purpose they used to traditional

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:12.800
release models do for a community-based distro or even an enterprise distro perspective.

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:16.560
With all the testing we do for Tumbleweed and our open QA process, we've managed to

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:20.920
make a rolling release that only rolls when we know the test, the thing isn't broken.

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:22.320
So they test it first.

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:25.440
Given the motivator for so many people for traditional community releases is I want the

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:29.240
latest shiny new stuff but I only want it when it works, Tumbleweed managed to do that

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:32.500
without a six or 12 month waiting period.

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:33.960
Is that possible?

01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.960
Yeah.

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:38.360
They actually had known first before Arch.

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:42.040
That doesn't mean that it's flawless.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:43.920
It actually wasn't flawless.

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:46.560
I think it's an exaggeration to claim flawless.

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:48.760
But it was very stable.

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:52.440
And I tried it out because I was being impatient.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.200
And it actually was really good.

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:57.080
I didn't notice any huge breaks or anything.

01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:00.640
I noticed some Gnome specific things but that was just Gnome things.

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:06.560
But the point about Tumbleweed though is they kind of explained in a weird diagram of what

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:15.400
the initial goal is that Tumbleweed will be like the sources for SLEE eventually in snapshot

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:16.400
form.

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:22.000
So Tumbleweed will be constantly being updated and maintained and then at some point in every

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.960
couple of years or so, they would take a snapshot of Tumbleweed, throw it into SLEE, then SUSE

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:34.320
would do their stuff to it, then they would become the core base to OpenSUSE which then

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.520
does their own stuff on top of it.

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:46.120
So basically what Noah was talking about last how he wanted a desktop enterprise solution,

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:52.480
that's pretty much what OpenSUSE is talking about.

01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:56.040
It seems to me though that OpenSUSE is essentially going to be just about as, and I think it's

01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:59.320
where the comparison to CentOS comes in, it's going to be just about as stale as Slew's

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:00.880
Enterprise Linux, right?

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:01.880
No.

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:04.760
Because you think they'll replace certain components as they need to?

01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:05.760
Yes.

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:10.060
They've already said that they were even thinking about updating the desktop environments away

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:12.160
from SLEE.

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:15.440
They haven't specified whether they're going to or not but they said that there's a potential

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:22.400
that they will so that there could absolutely be, the core fundamental packages are going

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:30.280
to be the same, I guess stale if you want to say it, like with SLEE stuff, but the user

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:36.760
space on top would be pretty much not as fast as Tumbleweed but a lot faster than their

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:37.760
current structure.

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:42.360
So it would be kind of like a LTS base with a nod on it.

01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:45.920
Right, okay, that's what I was going to ask, am I picturing the right thing when it's like,

01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:49.320
I guess, here's what, and Richard, I really appreciate him responding in the subreddit

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:57.920
too, I guess what I don't quite understand is how, I still don't, why would I choose,

01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:02.380
why would I choose, I guess I would have to wait and find out what components they're

01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:08.080
going to individually choose to replace and upgrade apart from SLEE before I know if OpenSUSE

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.080
is going to fit for me.

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:14.840
And right now it sounds like there's a lot of what ifs, well no, hear me out, if they

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:19.760
decide to update the desktop environment and the web browsers and things like that, all

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.320
those user land applications, that's pretty slick, kind of sounds like what Mint's doing.

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:27.480
But if they decide, well, we don't really have the manpower to do that, then it seems

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:32.540
like it could get to be just a basic CentOS kind of clone, and here's why I am concerned

01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:38.600
about that happening, A, I don't believe that OpenQA is going to catch all this stuff, I

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:42.360
think the way you catch stuff in Linux a lot of times is just a function of, a lot of people

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:45.560
use it for a while, they eventually find a bug and they fix it and then somebody patches

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:51.100
that bug and then a distro finally ships it, otherwise, right, because otherwise you could

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:53.320
just use rolling all the time.

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:58.600
So I think, I don't know if unit testing is really going to make a rolling distro that

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.360
much stable over another one, and I think you could have a bit of a reputation burn

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.680
there, okay, but that's point number one, now let me make a second point.

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:06.980
Second point, the reason why I'm concerned more about OpenSUSE and what components they're

01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:10.760
going to replace is because I think if we're totally honest with ourselves, why are we

01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.560
in this position right now?

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.880
Why are they making OpenSUSE 42?

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.240
Why are they doing Tumbleweed?

01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:20.080
Why are they going to base OpenSUSE off of SLEE?

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.200
Why?

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:25.600
Because only a couple of people are working on the project anymore, OpenSUSE, nobody's

01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:30.440
working on it, nobody cares about it, they're all working on Tumbleweed or SUSE Enterprise,

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:34.480
they said so themselves, in their own presentation and in their own blog post, the fundamental

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:38.640
problem with the last release of OpenSUSE is nobody wants to work on it, they all want

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:44.720
to work on Tumbleweed or the big dog, and so if that is a problem today, how is that

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:48.420
not going to be a problem two years, a year down the road, when they have this thing that's

01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:51.120
based on something that's already done, but now they have this pain in the neck where

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.600
they have to replace certain components and stay on top of that and ship it all the time?

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:58.000
It seems like they'll eventually just be right back in the same position they're at today,

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Tumbleweed will get all of the current active attention, and SLEE's going to get all of

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.080
the stability and money focused attention.

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.200
How does this solve their fundamental problem?

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:12.320
Okay, so to answer one about what is the reason to use this, you use Arch, so everything is

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:16.880
rolling anyway, so you would be Tumbleweed, like the exact transition, you would just

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.440
move to Tumbleweed and you'd have the same stuff you would have right now.

01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:22.320
Yeah, and I get that, Tumbleweed makes sense to me, I get it, I don't know if I believe

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:26.400
it's going to be as trouble-free as they say, but I bet it's going to be more trouble-free,

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:30.440
but I saw it, Tumbleweed makes sense, SUSE Enterprise makes sense to me, and I also see

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:33.280
from a business standpoint, where they have the dedication and resources, that it all

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:34.280
makes sense.

01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:40.280
Okay, so the second one, you don't understand why they would do this.

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:44.840
So OpenSUSE to me, 42, sounds like what it's going to be, is a pretty cool product based

01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:48.800
on some pretty nice stable Enterprise upstream source code.

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:52.280
Now then they're going to go, well this chunk and this chunk and this chunk, and they've

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:55.520
explained they've made it very easy to modulize and replace these chunks, they're going to

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:58.280
say this chunk, this chunk, and this chunk, we're going to swap out and we're going to

01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:04.440
maintain this ourselves on top of this SLEE base, KDE, Gnome, Firefox, whatever, we're

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:07.040
going to maintain this on top of the SLEE base ourselves.

01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:09.520
Well then aren't they just getting right back on this treadmill that they've been running

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:13.500
this entire time, that they all jumped ship from, and I'm mixing a lot of analogies here,

01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:16.940
but isn't this, what is different?

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:17.940
What changes?

01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:22.160
Isn't the core issue, the focus for the distro, wasn't the core issue that sort of prompted

01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:27.800
this, was that nobody was working on OpenSUSE, and I guess what this sounds like is it sounds

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:30.760
like we're trying to manage OpenSUSE a little bit.

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:34.980
We need some, you know, Red Hat has CentOS and Fedora, they're doing Fedora Core, they're

01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:38.920
making Fedora Workstation and Fedora Cloud, they're getting very serious with the Atomic

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:44.400
project about making Fedora an actual cloud deployable system.

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:48.880
You're seeing places like Rackspace, you're seeing places like DigitalOcean deploy Fedora,

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:52.060
you're not seeing them deploy OpenSUSE, that's got to bother them.

01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:55.800
So they want to get OpenSUSE into a place where it could be part of a VPS package, it

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:58.080
could be something that's installed on demand.

01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:02.700
It's kind of embarrassing, isn't it, that one of the biggest, for a long time, well-known

01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:07.140
distributions has like had very little game in the whole cloud space.

01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:11.680
Like Ubuntu just came and ate their lunch by surprise, and now I agree, they have to

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:14.440
do something to make OpenSUSE relevant in this space, it'd be great for them.

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:17.000
And I think this could do it, I think this would do it.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:20.600
If I knew OpenSUSE was based on enterprise source code, man, I'd feel a lot better about

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:23.720
deploying that on a production VPS for sure.

01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:28.600
I still don't see though why they are incentivized to maintain these individual layers of it

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:32.560
and keep those competitive when they're not incentivized to do it today.

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:34.160
That's the part I'm not seeing.

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.720
Okay, there's two things.

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:39.720
There's the gap between SUSE and OpenSUSE.

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:44.320
For example, with Red Hat, they have the code in Fedora, they have code in CentOS that they

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:48.440
can take improvements from Fedora and CentOS and easily put them in the Red Hat if they

01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.880
deem worthy to be in there.

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:55.240
SUSE and OpenSUSE don't have that, they don't have the integration that Red Hat does.

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:59.840
So for one, it solves that integration problem because the core structure of OpenSUSE is

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:04.360
going to be based on SLEE, and then Tumbleweed would eventually become Snapshots for SLEE,

01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:10.380
so they would get this integration level back into the benefits of SUSE with the backing

01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:14.600
and funding of everything and actually have a lot of work that's not just on the OpenSUSE

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:15.600
side.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:20.280
So right now, the reason why, your example, they didn't have much attention in OpenSUSE

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:23.960
because they wanted to do Tumbleweed, well, it's a community effort in that case, and

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:28.260
the people choose what they want to work on, and OpenSUSE didn't have a lot of people working

01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:31.720
on the OpenSUSE stable release because they wanted to be on Tumbleweed, and they didn't

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:36.240
have a base that they could build on to actually make that work.

01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:39.760
So this is actually solving that problem, so it doesn't matter what they want.

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:40.760
What does it change?

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:43.640
Because they're not going to have to put that work in, because the whole point of OpenSUSE

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:47.720
right now, the reason that was a problem is because they only had a handful of people

01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:52.760
working on this fundamental thing that they're handling everything, now they don't have to

01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:53.760
handle it.

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:54.760
Because they're going to pull it in from Tumbleweed.

01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:57.280
Because they're going to do the work in Tumbleweed.

01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:00.960
Pull it in from Tumbleweed and in from Sleeve, so it's kind of like a hybrid in those.

01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:04.800
And then, plus, I'm sure they've, and maybe you could tell me if this is true or not,

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:08.900
have they finished development on LibMagick that totally resolves all of the library issues

01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:11.760
between major versions when you're going from a stable enterprise district to something

01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:12.760
rolling?

01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:15.840
Does LibMagick just handle all of that?

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:18.320
I don't know.

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.520
I mean, let's look at Cinnamon.

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:25.980
Why has Cinnamon had so many problems landing in Arch when it's a rolling distribution?

01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:30.200
Because GTK underneath changes, and Cinnamon depends on an older version of GTK, and then

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:33.640
all of a sudden, you can't install Cinnamon on a rolling distro anymore.

01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:38.120
Now, is Tumbleweed going to make the decision in this case to hold GTK back, or am I going

01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:43.200
to be able to replace the entire GTK installation using the OpenSUSE build service?

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.560
How are they legitimately going to solve these real-world problems that have plagued every

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.680
other Linux distro since the invention of a rolling distro?

01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:51.960
How are they going to solve that?

01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:52.960
They're not going to roll everything.

01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:57.300
Like, Tumbleweed will roll everything, and you're not going to have any kind of connection

01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:59.880
with the stability issues whatsoever.

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:03.860
The part where they're pulling stuff from, they're going to pull stuff from Tumbleweed

01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:08.080
when it suits, like, for example, application level of, like, Firefox and things like that

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:09.800
that will not have any kind of linkage.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:14.320
That makes sense, but it seems like then there's going to be limitations.

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:19.960
There's going to be a certain pressure to keep OpenSUSE at least in somewhat compatibility

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:22.860
sync with Tumbleweed so that way they can move more stuff over, because the further

01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:26.720
those two drift, the less and less things they should be able to pull over from Tumbleweed,

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:27.720
I would think.

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:31.800
Well, yeah, but like fundamental things, yes, that'd be the problem, but they also are saying

01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:33.760
that it's not just Tumbleweed that they're pulling from.

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:38.360
They're also going to be, as the community of OpenSUSE, not just of Tumbleweed.

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:40.560
Yeah, sure, but why isn't that happening today?

01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.360
See, that's part of the argument I don't get.

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:44.160
Yeah, sure, they can custom develop that stuff.

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:46.880
They can make that stuff keep working on OpenSUSE, so they could be doing that today and they're

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:47.880
not doing it.

01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:48.880
I mean, they are doing it, but barely.

01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:51.120
They're barely getting it out the door.

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:53.080
That's because they are doing everything.

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:55.560
Yeah, you know, that could be, right?

01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:57.920
Yeah, maybe this will be enough of a pressure release.

01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:58.920
Yeah, boy, that'd be great.

01:31:58.920 --> 01:31:59.920
Good point.

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:04.440
That'd be really cool if this could – I have these questions that I've raised, and

01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:08.120
I guess sometimes when I ask these kinds of questions it sounds like I think it's a really

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:11.600
dumb idea, or it sounds like I don't think they should do it, and that's not the case

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:12.600
at all.

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:15.360
I'm just wondering, like, how are they going to – these – I guess what I'm trying to

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:18.240
do is I'm trying to identify what I perceive to be challenges they're going to have to

01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:23.160
overcome, and I'm really glad somebody's trying this approach, because I don't really

01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:28.560
think the Fedora one's going to necessarily resonate for a lot of people on servers, and

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:33.000
I just think that there is a great space in here for OpenSUSE to fill with this sort of

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.720
SLE based upstream source codes that give me a sort of assurance that it's based on

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:38.400
a really quality enterprise product.

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:39.600
I think this could be a killer.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:42.760
I'm not saying it's going to be a flop, but I am saying I think there's going to be significant

01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:47.080
challenges that I don't quite see all the solutions to, so I'm not trying to poop on

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:48.080
it.

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:53.040
Well, I mean, I just think that – like, the fundamental changes is that the people

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:59.360
who are working on the stuff to improve the user space in OpenSUSE, and they also had

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:03.400
to deal with the core fundamentals as well, but now they don't have to do that so they

01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:08.880
can do a lot more even in the OpenSUSE stable release level without the Tumbleweed, so they

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:14.180
have – they can – like, the pressure release is the biggest benefit of this, but you also

01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:20.240
have the people who want a stable base with a rolling top, or not even necessarily rolling,

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:23.920
but just more up to date than a regular release of most distros.

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:24.920
I got it.

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:25.920
Oh, man.

01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:28.760
I think for me, I think – because I don't really care what happens with SLE or OpenSUSE

01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:33.920
as so much as I think Tumbleweed is going to get really appealing to a user like me

01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:38.200
because – so not only do you have some really interesting technologies there, but I also

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:43.580
find the technologies around SUSE or OpenSUSE to be pretty sexy, like the OpenSUSE build

01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:47.240
service and the images where you can go custom machine and crank that out and download that

01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:51.140
as an ISO, and it's like, here's my machine already pre-set up, like, all that stuff really

01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:52.140
makes me hot.

01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:53.140
I think that's super great.

01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:56.520
And so you build a really great distro around that, and I actually think Zipper is a pretty

01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:00.200
decent technology, and I like that they're bold enough to back butter FS, even if I think

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:05.600
it's currently a train wreck that makes people lose data, but, you know, like, Martin from

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:09.800
the Netherlands wrote in, and Martin said, what makes OpenSUSE unique is that it's easy

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:12.200
enough to understand for anyone with a Windows technical background.

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:16.520
You kind of have the Windows paradigm when you use their KDE desktop, Yast is a lot like

01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:21.400
the control panel, all system settings can be configured via a GUI, unlike Fedora, and

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:25.040
at the same time, it remains fully focused on open source, where everything is contributed

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:28.000
back upstream, unlike Ubuntu, which is...

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.800
They have a corporate backing, giving me a feeling that the distribution won't disappear

01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:31.800
anytime soon.

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:36.920
He says, and I love this line, Martin says, it's like the Toyota of Linux distributions.

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:41.600
It's a bit boring to drive, but from a technical and reliability standpoint, it's the best.

01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.220
That's not bad.

01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:45.760
That's not a bad way to put it, really, and I don't think that's a slam at all.

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:46.760
I think that's a...

01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:49.800
I think it's a really good spot to be in as a distro, especially if you want people installing

01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:50.800
your servers.

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:55.000
All right, guys, anybody have any closing thoughts before we close the books on this

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
one?

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.320
Well, finally, just the OBS is another example of the updating software.

01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:05.240
So like the PPAs that Ubuntu have, OBS are going to provide a similar thing, but a lot

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:08.360
more organized way to do it.

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:09.360
But also...

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:10.360
And more approachable.

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.360
Definitely.

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:15.620
The cool thing is not only is the sources from SLEE coming to OpenSUSE, they're actually

01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:16.740
going to the OBS.

01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:21.280
So really, anybody who wants to get a source can do it.

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:24.880
You can actually, if you wanted to, maybe, this is just like...

01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:27.600
I'm completely talking out of my butt right now.

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:33.800
But SUSE Studio, plus the OBS, plus the SLEE releases, maybe you can make your own SLEE.

01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:36.480
Yeah, I think you definitely could.

01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:37.480
I think that's a...

01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:40.600
Wow, yeah, especially with the build service, that's going to be a thing.

01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:41.600
That's definitely going to be...

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:42.600
And that could be great for enterprises.

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:43.600
Oh, yeah, definitely.

01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.040
Ah, good, good, good thought.

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:46.040
Good thought.

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:47.640
Well, Wes, man, thank you for joining me in studio today.

01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:48.640
My pleasure.

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:49.640
It's good having you here.

01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:52.480

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:02.800
We do it over at jblive.tv where you can have your Flash player armed and ready to go.

01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:04.560
No, disable Flash this week.

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:05.560
That's our mission.

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:06.560
Disable Flash.

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:08.340
Use HLS, RTSP, RTMP.

01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:09.340
We've got it.

01:36:09.340 --> 01:36:10.340
They're linked.

Or go to jblive.fm and listen in audio.

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:13.960
Now, we do it over at jblive.tv.

01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:17.680
You don't have to use Flash if you don't want to, but we do it at 1 p.m. or 2 p.m.?

01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:18.680
2 p.m.

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:19.680
Yeah, that's right.

01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:20.680
That's right.

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:21.680
Because we've got to have time for lunch, guys.

01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:22.680
Right?

01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:23.680
Got to have time for lunch.

01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:24.680
And beer.

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:25.680
And beer.

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:28.000
LinuxActionShow.reddit.com for feedback to this week's episode, and join us right back

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000
here next Tuesday.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:49.880
Okay, just do this.

01:36:49.880 --> 01:37:07.960
And another show is in the bag.

01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:12.960
Any post-show topics we wanted to get to before we skedaddle?

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:17.160
I got a meeting I gotta get to in a little bit.

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.880
I feel like I talked just as much as you did.

01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:19.880
Yeah, you did talk a lot.

01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:22.960
But it was good because it was a good thing you were here today because it was topics

01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:23.960
that were up your alley.

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:26.320
I'm glad we got it covered.

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:27.320
First hand sushi experience.

01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:29.120
Great topics and great conversation, guys.

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:30.120
Yeah, it was.

01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:31.120
Thank you.

01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:32.120
And it's great having Wes.

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:34.200
It's fun having someone I can look over to and talk to because otherwise I'm just standing

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:35.200
here by myself.

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:41.240
Now, there was a privacy topic I wanted to retouch on.

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:44.420
But maybe, I don't know, since we don't have a lot of time, maybe it'd be better to address

01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:47.880
it next time when we can actually spend some serious time on it.

01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:54.180
The mumble's got an update that's coming out soon for the next version of 1.3 is not going

01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:56.800
to have the stupid lips.

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:58.640
What is it going to have instead?

01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:03.500
It's actually replacing the theme with an actual good theme from this guy named X-Poke

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:07.760
and he made something called Metro Mumble, which looks pretty slick.

01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:08.760
Using it now.

01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:11.080
Is that the skin you and I were already using?

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:12.080
Yes, it is.

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:13.080
Metro Mumble, huh?

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:15.480
It does look pretty though, doesn't it?

01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:16.480
Yeah.

01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:22.880
A thing to note though, if you have a custom theme already applied and then you update,

01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:28.480
it will unapply your custom theme and default to the light new theme.

01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:32.640
So if you're using the dark theme, like I was, it'll just go away randomly and you wonder

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.640
why.

01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:37.800
And then you go and see that, oh, there's new options in the look and feel section.

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:41.720
Not only is it new options, they've completely rebuilt the system so the skin structure where

01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:44.380
you can control what you use is gone.

01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:49.280
You have to change a new arbitrary folder structure that you have to place the themes

01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:54.680
in and they don't tell you on Linux where your stuff is.

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:57.920
They tell you on Windows and only Windows.

01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:04.160
I had to figure out where everything was and it's like a stupid arbitrary location that

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:12.760
even in its own selection is just absurd because it is, I'm just going to type it in the chat

01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:14.560
right now actually.

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:18.120
I'm so close to jeopardizing my mumble setup here.

01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:21.320
Is this just a theme that you could apply to an existing mumble?

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:22.320
Yeah I just applied it.

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:23.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.320
You can apply it to your existing mumble right now.

01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:25.320
BOOM!

01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:26.320
But in the new version...

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:27.320
Go ahead, if you want to download and play it, you can.

01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:28.320
It's up to you.

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:30.960
All you have to do is restart the mumble and restart the client.

01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:34.080
Oh, I didn't even have to restart, I just hit apply and then bam, I had it like a boost,

01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:35.080
I think.

01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:36.080
Well, some of the icons won't update once you restart.

01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:37.080
Oh yeah, you're right.

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:38.080
I'll do that.

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:39.080
I'll restart.

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:41.480
I posted the location of the themes folder now.

01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:49.320
It's local share mumble mumble themes and the mumble twice is important and also the

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:50.840
themes folder does not exist.

01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:52.840
You have to create it first and then put the theme in there.

01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:58.600
So hey, would you mind, Mr. Corbs, if we reset just really quick so we can put this in the

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:01.060
pre-show since a lot of people listening to this show use mumble.

01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:02.960
If you want to say, say how can we do this?

01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:05.280
Actually why don't we make this the mumble pre-show?

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:06.280
Sure.

01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:10.720
Yeah, so maybe the theme, where to get it and where to put it on Linux while I go grab

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.120
this printout and that will be like the pre-show.

01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:13.120
Sure.

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:14.120
All right, I'm muting my mic.

01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:15.120
There you go.

01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:16.120
Have at it.

01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:17.120
Okay.

01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:22.160
So mumble is, they're actually updating to a new version.

01:40:22.160 --> 01:40:26.880
This currently you can get in a PPA or in the AUR in a snapshot version and it's 1.3.

01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:31.560
They're instituting a new default theme, which is actually really nice looking, but you can

01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.960
get it right now.

01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:38.400
It's for use in 1.2 to add as a skin.

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:48.320
And you get it from the GitHub link I posted in IRC and put it wherever you want.

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:56.240
And you can just go into your settings for configure and then choose the QSS file inside

01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:58.840
of the skins structure.

01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:03.520
This is how you do it in 1.2 and 1.3 it's automatically already available and you can

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:05.360
choose between the light and the dark.

01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:11.320
The problem with that is that in 1.3 the theme is embedded into the program so you can't

01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:12.600
change anything.

01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:17.320
And one of the reasons this theme is actually awesome is because the majority of the icons

01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:19.040
are SVGs.

01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:25.960
So like for example, when you open this theme by default the non-talking icon is red and

01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:31.800
I think that is hideous, especially when it goes into my system tray and it just falls.

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:39.360
So you can change that in the SVG code with just a slight hex value, change it to white

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:42.400
or gray or whatever fits best on your theme and it's good to go.

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:47.920
So the problem with the 1.3 is that you can't do that unless you download this theme and

01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:49.920
put it in the correct themes folder.

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:57.640
And the correct theme folder is an arbitrary location that actually does not exist.

01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:02.360
You have to create the folder there.

01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:04.820
It is the location I just posted in IRC.

01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:10.440
It's.local slash share slash mumble slash mumble then themes folder does not exist.

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:16.440
You create the theme folder then you put this extracted theme into that folder and then

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:21.640
the new 1.3 snapshot will notice that theme has been added and you can select it from

01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:31.800
the drop down and it will save all of your modifications and things like that.

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:36.960
So I just applied it and lost all my audio.

01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:39.440
That shouldn't make any difference for the themes.

01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:45.720
And I've just switched back and the audio came back.

01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:47.520
It's very weird.

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:49.240
It's just again it shouldn't change any audio.

01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:52.600
Yeah it doesn't change any audio whatsoever.

01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:57.200
I got the new theme installed and working.

01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:01.200
I'm running the new theme on 1.3.

01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:05.880
The thing that was annoying to me is that when I had the theme already and they updated

01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:12.720
and it went to the same theme but it turned into white and it also essentially ignored

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:16.640
all the modifications I did because it wasn't looking for the right folder anymore.

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:21.640
And when I went to ask them where it was they had no idea.

01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:26.280
The developers or maybe not the developers that actually made the change but the people

01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:32.600
who are the support team in mumble for the IRC had no clue where the stuff was located

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:33.600
in Linux.

01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:36.760
They sent me a link that said here's where it is.

01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:39.880
That's Windows only and that's not very helpful.

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:44.240
So essentially I had to figure it out myself and it took me about 30 minutes but that's

01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:48.720
the folder structure where it is now so at least no one else has figured it out.

01:43:48.720 --> 01:44:15.360
I'm going to edit their wiki so it actually displays it properly.
