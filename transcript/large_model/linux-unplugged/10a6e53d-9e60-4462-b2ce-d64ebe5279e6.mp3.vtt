00:00.000 --> 00:01.780
Hey, you know what we ought to do in the pre-show?

00:01.780 --> 00:03.900
Is document right here for eternity

00:03.900 --> 00:06.240
the fact that Wimpy broke our Mumble server this week.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.380
So we're using Jitsi.

00:07.380 --> 00:08.300
You're welcome.

00:08.300 --> 00:09.660
Do I even want to know what you were doing?

00:09.660 --> 00:10.940
Do I even want to know?

00:10.940 --> 00:13.340
I just pasted the bomb emoji into the comment

00:13.340 --> 00:15.460
and hit save and it blew up the Mumble server.

00:15.460 --> 00:16.700
It was beautiful.

00:16.700 --> 00:17.540
Ah.

00:25.540 --> 00:27.440
Hello friends and welcome back

00:27.440 --> 00:29.360
to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.260
My name is Chris.

00:30.260 --> 00:31.320
My name is Wes.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.500
And my name is Brent.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.320
Hello gentlemen, anchor down

00:34.320 --> 00:36.520
because it's a windy day in the Pacific Northwest

00:36.520 --> 00:39.000
and I don't want either one of you to blow away

00:39.000 --> 00:40.880
because we've got a lot going on in this episode.

00:40.880 --> 00:43.320
But first, I must say it's brought to you by a Cloud Guru,

00:43.320 --> 00:44.280
the leader in learning for the cloud,

00:44.280 --> 00:45.320
Linux and other modern tech skills.

00:45.320 --> 00:47.420
Hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

00:47.420 --> 00:51.400
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.840
So coming up on the show today,

00:53.840 --> 00:56.840
it's our episode where we defend the command line.

00:56.840 --> 01:00.160
In this particular week that we are recording,

01:00.160 --> 01:04.280
the command line is coming under attack

01:04.280 --> 01:06.380
and we're going to hunker down and defend it.

01:06.380 --> 01:08.840
In fact, I may even attempt to argue

01:08.840 --> 01:11.580
that the command line could be new user-friendly.

01:11.580 --> 01:15.220
And I think everyone who is discouraging learning

01:15.220 --> 01:16.820
or using the command line

01:16.820 --> 01:18.880
is actually burying their head in the sand

01:18.880 --> 01:22.280
and they're doing a disservice to Linux adoption long-term.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.300
I think we should be teaching people the command line,

01:24.300 --> 01:25.600
not avoiding it.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.260
That's key to future Linux user success.

01:28.260 --> 01:29.180
So we'll talk about that

01:29.180 --> 01:31.160
and why I feel that way so strongly.

01:31.160 --> 01:33.280
And then we'll round out the show with some great emails,

01:33.280 --> 01:34.520
some pics and more.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.860
So before we go any further,

01:35.860 --> 01:37.120
I'm going to bring in our virtual lug.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.720
Hello, Jitsi Room.

01:38.720 --> 01:42.120
Hello, hello, hello.

01:42.120 --> 01:45.120
It's got its pros and cons compared to Mumble.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.280
You know, I think Jitsi is a pretty cool tool.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.320
And I like seeing some of you, that's very nice,

01:49.320 --> 01:51.680
but it doesn't quite have the same smoothness

01:51.680 --> 01:54.120
handling audio from everyone like Mumble does.

01:54.120 --> 01:56.600
Yeah, WebRTC just can't compete.

01:56.600 --> 01:59.160
Yeah, Mumble is really kind of good at that.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.600
And plus we can have structured rooms

02:00.600 --> 02:01.920
with permissions and stuff.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.800
And you know, it's not so with Jitsi, at least not yet.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.600
Yeah, and so far Wimpy hasn't figured out

02:07.600 --> 02:10.000
how to break Jitsi, at least I don't think.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.200
Oh no, I have, I'm just not going to do it.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.600
I don't want to torpedo the show twice in one evening.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.040
I appreciate that.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.500
So before we jump into the community news

02:18.500 --> 02:20.480
and whatnot today, Wes,

02:20.480 --> 02:23.940
I think it's time for maybe the very last time

02:23.940 --> 02:25.280
we do an ARCH update.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.000
Ah, dang it, I thought you'd forgotten.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.520
I think this is it, because a lot of things are in motion.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.260
We have parts in route.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.600
We have more things happening this weekend.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.120
And I thought maybe for one last time

02:39.120 --> 02:40.920
we should officially check in.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.680
Cause you never know, this could be the one that breaks.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.560
This could be it.

02:43.560 --> 02:44.760
I mean, it could be.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.680
Yeah, and I'm going to miss these when they're gone.

02:46.680 --> 02:47.720
I know, it's been fun.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.880
So tell me, tell me what we're looking at.

02:49.880 --> 02:50.800
Cause it's been a minute.

02:50.800 --> 02:55.800
Woo wee, 127 packages, 652 megs download,

02:56.720 --> 02:58.720
only 63 megs net upgrade,

02:58.720 --> 03:01.140
but there's some good packages to upgrade in here.

03:01.140 --> 03:03.800
ButterFS, Cockpit, Containerd,

03:03.800 --> 03:07.000
we weren't using that, Docker, Docker Compose.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.280
Yes, we're getting a new Linux LTS kernel,

03:10.280 --> 03:12.440
update to Snapper, SystemD,

03:12.440 --> 03:16.000
and of course a new ZFS DKMS module.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.400
Oh boy.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.020
And that's not even to mention the fact

03:19.020 --> 03:21.080
that there's a new SSH server,

03:21.080 --> 03:26.080
new Samba, this is a huge update.

03:26.240 --> 03:30.040
So I guess, I guess hit the go button,

03:30.040 --> 03:31.640
let's start the downloads

03:31.640 --> 03:33.960
and we'll come back and see, see what happens.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.240
Wish me luck everyone.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.560
All right, and then while you do that,

03:37.560 --> 03:41.300
I have the pleasure to announce something very special

03:41.300 --> 03:42.240
coming soon.

03:42.240 --> 03:49.040
It's the 2021 Tuxes.

03:49.040 --> 03:51.320
All right, so the nominations are open.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.420
You can go vote for the best free software projects,

03:53.420 --> 03:55.480
Linux distros, text editors,

03:55.480 --> 03:57.120
the big impactor of the year,

03:57.120 --> 03:59.720
server distros and a lot more.

03:59.720 --> 04:02.380
What really stood out in 2021?

04:02.380 --> 04:05.960
Head over right now to tuxes.party.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.400
We've only got a little bit of time,

04:10.400 --> 04:14.400
tuxes.party or I'll have a link in the show notes of course.

04:14.400 --> 04:15.520
It's not too many questions.

04:15.520 --> 04:16.960
I tried to refine it,

04:16.960 --> 04:18.880
thanks to some help from the virtual lug

04:18.880 --> 04:19.960
before we started the show.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.840
We kind of whittled the list down a little bit

04:21.840 --> 04:24.280
and I think it's gonna be pretty quick to answer.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.560
Not everything's on there.

04:25.560 --> 04:26.980
Cause if you think about it,

04:26.980 --> 04:28.200
we could rabbit hole this thing

04:28.200 --> 04:29.540
like a million different ways.

04:29.540 --> 04:32.480
So we tried to just kind of keep it concise

04:32.480 --> 04:35.920
and do something that we could build year on year data.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.840
So maybe after a few years of doing the Tuxes,

04:38.840 --> 04:40.560
we'll have some trends and interesting things

04:40.560 --> 04:41.400
that come out of it.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.800
So go to tuxes.party and go vote.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.100
We are trying it out with next cloud forums too.

04:46.100 --> 04:49.480
So West stood up a new next cloud server for this

04:49.480 --> 04:51.460
and cause we honestly didn't wanna make

04:51.460 --> 04:53.000
our precious next cloud servers,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.480
which we have two of available to all of you.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.160
Well, now we have three.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.240
Now we have three.

04:58.240 --> 05:01.320
So go over there and vote and let us know what you think.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.680
And then towards the end of the year,

05:02.680 --> 05:05.400
just pretty much like maybe one of our last few episodes

05:05.400 --> 05:06.480
of the year,

05:06.480 --> 05:08.800
we'll announce the winners

05:08.800 --> 05:11.280
and the winners of last year

05:11.280 --> 05:13.480
received not only our accolades,

05:13.480 --> 05:15.180
but some of them that I could track down

05:15.180 --> 05:17.080
also received a little Tuxy trophy.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.260
I think this year we'll do something else

05:19.260 --> 05:20.320
pretty special for them too.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.640
So go try it out.

05:21.640 --> 05:23.120
And I guess this is our big test

05:23.120 --> 05:26.340
to see how next cloud does for forums.

05:26.340 --> 05:29.680
It's gonna output all the data as a CSV file, right?

05:29.680 --> 05:32.280
So gonna have to massage that a little bit.

05:32.280 --> 05:35.960
Yeah, I mean, I totally tested it with one entry in there

05:35.960 --> 05:36.800
in that network.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.460
So it should scale to the size of the audience, right?

05:41.720 --> 05:43.200
I wanna mention our friends at a Cloud Guru

05:43.200 --> 05:44.720
have a Linux web services course

05:44.720 --> 05:46.280
that might be right up your alley.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.160
Learn about the various software tools

05:48.160 --> 05:51.360
and utilities to configure web services on Linux.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.640
And yeah, that means the differences

05:52.640 --> 05:54.040
between NGINX and Apache,

05:54.040 --> 05:56.200
setting up squid and reverse proxy,

05:56.200 --> 05:59.560
figuring out how to do HTTPS and SSL and load balancing,

05:59.560 --> 06:01.380
getting metrics out of Apache,

06:01.380 --> 06:03.600
all of that stuff is in a Cloud Guru's course.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.840
So I have a link in the show notes

06:04.840 --> 06:06.640
or go over to a cloudguru.com

06:06.640 --> 06:08.760
and search for Linux web services.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.600
Again, that's a cloudguru.com

06:10.600 --> 06:12.540
and the course is Linux web services.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.000
We'll have a link in the show notes.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.400
But one of the big stories over the weekend

06:18.400 --> 06:21.820
is that System76 is reportedly developing

06:21.820 --> 06:26.760
their own rust written desktop, not based on GNOME.

06:26.760 --> 06:31.480
It all really stems from a couple of comments

06:31.480 --> 06:34.520
from a System76 engineer on Reddit.

06:34.520 --> 06:38.680
I mean, this whole story just blew up

06:38.680 --> 06:41.760
from just a few comments about some challenges

06:41.760 --> 06:43.440
with what they're experiencing

06:43.440 --> 06:45.440
with I think maintaining cosmic.

06:45.440 --> 06:48.940
And I didn't really know how legit this story was,

06:48.940 --> 06:51.440
because when you read through some of the articles,

06:51.440 --> 06:53.380
you can see some frustration with the engineer.

06:53.380 --> 06:56.360
Like one of the things that he wrote in the Reddit comments

06:56.360 --> 06:58.680
is what are you expecting us to do?

06:58.680 --> 06:59.880
We have a desktop environment

06:59.880 --> 07:02.480
that has a collection of GNOME Shell extensions,

07:02.480 --> 07:04.920
which break every GNOME Shell release.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.480
Either we move towards maintaining tens of thousands

07:07.480 --> 07:12.480
of lines of monkey patches, or we do it the right way.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.440
We make the next step of fully fledged desktop environment

07:15.440 --> 07:16.900
equal to GNOME Shell.

07:18.320 --> 07:21.240
And that just took off like wildfire.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.120
And so I emailed Carl, the CEO of System76,

07:25.040 --> 07:27.940
and I said, you know, is there smoke to this?

07:27.940 --> 07:30.000
Is there fire to the smoke, I guess is the saying?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.040
You know, how legit is this?

07:31.040 --> 07:32.520
What are you guys, where are you at?

07:32.520 --> 07:33.360
Where's your heads at?

07:33.360 --> 07:34.380
What's going on here?

07:34.380 --> 07:35.880
And of course I asked, why not Plasma?

07:35.880 --> 07:37.560
Oh, good man, yeah.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.560
I mean, right?

07:38.560 --> 07:40.560
I mean, isn't everybody thinking how amazing would it be

07:40.560 --> 07:43.600
if a well resourced vendor came along

07:43.600 --> 07:44.880
and got their hands on Plasma

07:44.880 --> 07:47.700
and really gave a go at doing a deployment of Plasma?

07:47.700 --> 07:50.000
And we all wanna see what would happen.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.760
But that is not this day, my friends.

07:51.760 --> 07:55.260
Carl writes, we are designing and writing codes

07:55.260 --> 07:57.680
towards a cosmic desktop environment.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.760
Both are experimental and intended only to test

08:00.760 --> 08:04.680
the tech stack that we will eventually land on.

08:04.680 --> 08:06.260
I think it's likely this will result

08:06.260 --> 08:07.760
in a new desktop environment,

08:07.760 --> 08:09.300
but we have other questions to answer

08:09.300 --> 08:11.160
before that's official.

08:11.160 --> 08:14.280
The investment we're making in POP is large regardless.

08:14.280 --> 08:17.660
We're putting similar resources into the 2023 version of POP

08:17.660 --> 08:19.260
that we put into the factory.

08:19.260 --> 08:22.080
The desktop environment is only one part of the story.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.240
There's more to come.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.080
And then in regards to when I asked about Plasma,

08:25.080 --> 08:30.080
he says, Qt is C++, and it doesn't have rust bindings.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.840
We considered Kaywin and had the same problem.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.400
Our team's expertise is in rust.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.120
Most of all, we're spending more time adapting upstream

08:39.120 --> 08:41.240
than adding value for our customers.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.880
Building and maintaining the desktop environment

08:42.880 --> 08:45.800
will be considerable, but at least it will work

08:45.800 --> 08:47.520
towards our vision for the future

08:47.520 --> 08:49.720
of a desktop operating system.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.760
So what I've took away from this email from Carl,

08:51.760 --> 08:54.600
and I'm curious if this is what you take away, Wes,

08:54.600 --> 08:57.200
is this is a direction they're heading,

08:57.200 --> 08:59.320
but it's in the R&D phase right now.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.120
Yeah, I mean, we haven't seen a whole bunch of fanfare

09:02.120 --> 09:04.200
as you pointed out.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.200
I'm definitely maybe a bit skeptical on one hand,

09:07.200 --> 09:09.000
just because I think that's the default

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
whenever you hear about a new desktop environment

09:11.000 --> 09:11.840
coming out, I think.

09:11.840 --> 09:15.160
But I have enjoyed watching what they've been trying

09:15.160 --> 09:17.440
with Cosmic, and yeah, I mean, it seems like

09:17.440 --> 09:18.680
the way they've done it so far,

09:18.680 --> 09:20.480
there were just gonna be some limitations,

09:20.480 --> 09:22.880
and if they're really hitting up against those,

09:22.880 --> 09:24.440
you gotta do something else.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.360
I kinda wanna go around the horn on this one.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.560
I'm looking right now, because I have video with Jitsi,

09:28.560 --> 09:31.480
and I'm seeing Neil's eyebrows go up,

09:31.480 --> 09:33.400
and of course, I've got questions for Wimpy,

09:33.400 --> 09:34.480
so I'll start with you, Neil,

09:34.480 --> 09:37.040
and then we'll go around the horn from there.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.400
What was your initial reaction?

09:38.400 --> 09:39.400
Because I think it's pretty easy

09:39.400 --> 09:40.680
to have a knee-jerk reaction of,

09:40.680 --> 09:42.520
well, we have too many desktop environments,

09:42.520 --> 09:44.280
why do we need another one?

09:44.280 --> 09:47.280
But it seems to me that System76

09:47.280 --> 09:49.440
could be in a unique position

09:49.440 --> 09:51.640
where they do have a very tight feedback loop

09:51.640 --> 09:53.120
with their customer base.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.880
They sell a physical product that is gonna come loaded

09:55.880 --> 09:57.800
with whatever they end up creating,

09:57.800 --> 09:59.400
and if things don't work, they're gonna hear about it

09:59.400 --> 10:01.960
from those customers who are working through support,

10:01.960 --> 10:04.720
and in a way, they have kind of a tighter feedback loop

10:04.720 --> 10:08.600
than just about any free desktop environment has right now.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.280
Does that give them a special position

10:10.280 --> 10:11.400
to create something here?

10:11.400 --> 10:13.680
Absolutely, it certainly does.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.320
Fundamentally, free software is all about creating projects

10:16.320 --> 10:17.720
that solve your own problems,

10:17.720 --> 10:20.240
and their problems weren't getting solved

10:20.240 --> 10:23.720
with the way Cosmic was being done now,

10:23.720 --> 10:26.160
with the extensions layered on top of GNOME Shell,

10:26.160 --> 10:29.240
and I totally get where they're going with this.

10:29.240 --> 10:32.960
From the perspective of what Carl Richel was saying

10:32.960 --> 10:35.560
about them creating their own desktop

10:35.560 --> 10:38.240
gives them better control to focus on their vision,

10:38.240 --> 10:39.960
I can totally see that viewpoint.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.680
It makes a ton of sense.

10:41.680 --> 10:44.640
However, it is already difficult

10:44.640 --> 10:48.760
to get people to do stuff on desktop Linux as a whole,

10:48.760 --> 10:53.760
and the more splintering in actually advancement

10:53.760 --> 10:58.200
of desktop technologies to support various users,

10:58.200 --> 11:00.080
the more difficult it is for the Linux platform

11:00.080 --> 11:01.440
as a whole to succeed.

11:01.440 --> 11:04.320
Like, already today, for example,

11:04.320 --> 11:07.280
accessibility and internationalization

11:07.280 --> 11:11.640
are really, really not in great shape

11:11.640 --> 11:13.880
in all the desktops except for GNOME.

11:13.880 --> 11:18.080
That's because 20 years ago, Sun Microsystems

11:18.080 --> 11:19.520
put a buttload of effort

11:19.520 --> 11:23.360
into making that happen with GNOME 2.0,

11:23.360 --> 11:25.920
and GNOME has reaped the benefits of that

11:25.920 --> 11:27.600
in the 20 years after.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.840
And with KDE Plasma, for example,

11:29.840 --> 11:32.280
because you asked that of Carl,

11:32.280 --> 11:34.280
I think the real reason that KDE Plasma

11:34.280 --> 11:36.120
doesn't really go further

11:36.120 --> 11:38.480
is because there isn't somebody

11:38.480 --> 11:40.560
doing that tight feedback loop

11:40.560 --> 11:43.240
and has the correct incentives

11:43.240 --> 11:46.200
to stick at it and drive it forward.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.560
But I also think that the reason why they're doing this

11:48.560 --> 11:51.440
is because their experience with GNOME

11:51.440 --> 11:53.720
was painful enough to turn them away

11:53.720 --> 11:54.960
from doing this again.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.600
And so I understand what they're feeling

11:57.600 --> 11:58.960
from that perspective.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.280
With that in mind, where I kind of almost feel

12:01.280 --> 12:04.560
like there's some echoes of falling out

12:04.560 --> 12:05.680
that we saw with Canonical

12:05.680 --> 12:08.240
when they decided to launch Unity.

12:08.240 --> 12:10.520
And so, Wimpy, is there a parallel there that you see?

12:10.520 --> 12:11.960
And then the second question I have for you

12:11.960 --> 12:14.840
on top of whatever else thoughts you might have

12:14.840 --> 12:18.320
is when you look at System76's products

12:18.320 --> 12:21.200
as an option in a marketplace,

12:21.200 --> 12:23.480
isn't it a pretty big risk to hit the reset button

12:23.480 --> 12:25.120
on a desktop environment right now

12:25.120 --> 12:27.840
when there's some really serious competition out there?

12:27.840 --> 12:30.400
So the first thing I'd say is there's a quote,

12:30.400 --> 12:32.560
I forget who said it,

12:32.560 --> 12:36.000
and it's people that care about software

12:36.000 --> 12:38.120
should make their own hardware.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.880
And it seems to me that System76

12:39.880 --> 12:41.640
are kind of coming at this the other way

12:41.640 --> 12:45.760
and coming to the same landing place,

12:45.760 --> 12:47.560
which is they care about their hardware.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.320
So now they're caring about the software

12:49.320 --> 12:51.040
that they ship on their hardware.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.800
And I think that that's a good place to be.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.600
Like you say, they know their customers,

12:55.600 --> 12:58.000
they know what their customers are looking for,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
they know what they want to give to their customers.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.360
And if they're not finding that with the available options,

13:03.360 --> 13:05.960
then as Neil says, yes, the whole point is

13:05.960 --> 13:09.000
that they've got this massive tool set

13:09.000 --> 13:12.200
of amazing software that they can use

13:12.200 --> 13:13.280
to put something together.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.520
Now, there's gonna be some significant effort

13:15.520 --> 13:19.160
to actually create something of their own, but why not?

13:19.160 --> 13:22.880
Well, we shouldn't resist people's desire

13:22.880 --> 13:25.600
to be creative and make something new.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.280
This conversation is the first time I've heard about this.

13:28.280 --> 13:30.760
I didn't see any of the discussion on Reddit,

13:30.760 --> 13:34.400
but yes, on the face of it, it does sound similar,

13:34.400 --> 13:37.640
that when Canonical had a vision

13:37.640 --> 13:40.360
for what they wanted to deliver to their users

13:40.360 --> 13:43.640
on the desktop and that deviated from Gnome's vision,

13:43.640 --> 13:46.280
then Canonical ended up going their own way.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.720
And that's fine too.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.560
You don't always have to use something existing.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.640
It's a big undertaking though.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.680
Just maintaining a desktop environment

13:54.680 --> 13:56.600
is a significant effort.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.080
Actually creating something new

13:59.080 --> 14:02.960
and then building it, that's a ton of work.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.720
Any significant software project

14:04.720 --> 14:07.600
you should look at as a 10-year endeavor.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.920
So if they're gonna go this way,

14:10.920 --> 14:12.240
it will be an interesting journey

14:12.240 --> 14:15.080
and one that I will enjoy following.

14:15.080 --> 14:18.320
I don't think they will be alone in doing something

14:18.320 --> 14:19.160
like this.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.240
We've already seen Josh Strobel put out

14:21.240 --> 14:24.400
sort of not a manifesto as such,

14:24.400 --> 14:26.760
but he wrote up that he was stuck

14:26.760 --> 14:28.760
between a rock and a hard place.

14:28.760 --> 14:32.840
And I know from my time at my past employer

14:32.840 --> 14:35.080
that things are in the works.

14:35.080 --> 14:35.920
Right.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.760
That's all very insightful, Wimpy.

14:37.760 --> 14:40.720
And I'm struck by this also sort of opens up

14:40.720 --> 14:44.360
the Gnome project to just push forward on their vision

14:44.360 --> 14:46.800
and collaborate with people who are on board

14:46.800 --> 14:48.400
and people who are not on board

14:48.400 --> 14:50.680
can focus on their own vision.

14:50.680 --> 14:51.960
It actually seems like long-term,

14:51.960 --> 14:54.360
it's gonna be better for a lot of projects.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.960
But Brent, there was something Carl said in that email

14:56.960 --> 14:58.160
that jumped out at me.

14:58.160 --> 14:59.760
And I wonder how you interpret.

14:59.760 --> 15:03.680
He said, we're going to invest in this.

15:03.680 --> 15:07.360
I think he said in 2023, like we invested in the factory.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.720
And you've been there, you've seen what that factory,

15:09.720 --> 15:13.320
what that means is staffing, it means equipment.

15:13.320 --> 15:15.200
I mean, it means a lot of things,

15:15.200 --> 15:17.400
but where do you think that could go?

15:17.400 --> 15:18.840
Like, what's your interpretation?

15:18.840 --> 15:20.440
Well, I think what we all saw

15:20.440 --> 15:24.160
when we got our really, really fascinating tour

15:24.160 --> 15:26.040
of their factory recently is that

15:26.920 --> 15:29.640
when they jump into something, they jump full steam ahead

15:29.640 --> 15:32.600
and they try to get some of the best talent to work on that.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.760
And so it's not a 50% effort from them that we see,

15:35.760 --> 15:39.200
it's sort of a hundred percent plus plus, you know?

15:39.200 --> 15:43.280
So what I would really love to see maybe in,

15:43.280 --> 15:45.240
you know, he said 2023,

15:45.240 --> 15:48.640
is if they take that same idea of innovation

15:48.640 --> 15:51.280
that they applied to something like the launch keyboard.

15:51.280 --> 15:55.000
You know, we had some pretty fascinating discussions

15:55.000 --> 15:58.960
about what went into even the starting phases

15:58.960 --> 16:02.880
of implementing those ideas into what is a keyboard

16:02.880 --> 16:05.840
that we sort of assume was optimized already,

16:05.840 --> 16:08.200
but they threw in some innovations

16:08.200 --> 16:10.200
that weren't necessarily obvious,

16:10.200 --> 16:12.080
but now seem really fascinating.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.960
And they even told us they had to scale it back a little bit

16:14.960 --> 16:16.320
to make it a bit more approachable.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.880
So I'm really curious, similar to Wimpy,

16:18.880 --> 16:23.720
to see if they jump full in as they tend to do,

16:23.720 --> 16:26.120
where will that take the desktop?

16:26.120 --> 16:27.840
And will they implement ideas

16:27.840 --> 16:29.120
that are maybe a little bit different

16:29.120 --> 16:30.640
than what we're seeing out there already?

16:30.640 --> 16:32.720
Right, you could say obsessive,

16:32.720 --> 16:34.000
and that would be an understatement.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.200
So Wimpy, I know you have a wrap up thought, go ahead.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.440
As we were saying, they are not alone

16:38.440 --> 16:42.400
in having feelings of sort of disenfranchisement

16:42.400 --> 16:45.120
over the current situation.

16:45.120 --> 16:49.040
I wonder if System76, if they move beyond

16:49.040 --> 16:53.040
what sounds like sort of prototyping and experimentation,

16:53.040 --> 16:57.160
if they move beyond that into actually scoping something,

16:57.160 --> 17:00.400
whether they'd be up for approaching individuals

17:00.400 --> 17:03.600
and teams of people who probably feel the same as them

17:03.600 --> 17:07.960
and trying to sort of bootstrap a project

17:07.960 --> 17:10.160
that they can sort of lead.

17:10.160 --> 17:15.160
Because I feel like there is a community in the making,

17:15.160 --> 17:17.200
behind something else.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.040
That's a really interesting question, yeah.

17:19.040 --> 17:21.960
Can they form a new locus of community around this?

17:21.960 --> 17:23.960
Because that was my other thought when we were talking about

17:23.960 --> 17:26.680
there can be this tight fit with their customer base

17:26.680 --> 17:27.800
and the people they support.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.400
And that just made me wonder,

17:29.400 --> 17:32.360
well, how well does that map onto the general wider community

17:32.360 --> 17:33.560
and do we lose out on some of that?

17:33.560 --> 17:36.080
But if there is something of a new consensus

17:36.080 --> 17:37.880
forming around that, maybe it does have

17:37.880 --> 17:39.760
something broader in its reach.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.200
Well, I know we have more thoughts,

17:41.200 --> 17:42.120
but I wanna move forward.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.280
So save them for the post-show,

17:43.280 --> 17:47.040
because we have one more news story to cover.

17:47.040 --> 17:52.040
It's been nine years since the Steam beta rolled out.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.720
Take that in everybody.

18:00.360 --> 18:04.680
I still can clearly remember putting together the research

18:04.680 --> 18:07.240
and trying to verify some of the rumors

18:07.240 --> 18:09.080
that Larbel had printed on Foronix

18:09.080 --> 18:12.280
about the beta potentially coming to Linux one day.

18:12.280 --> 18:13.840
I still clearly remember the effort

18:13.840 --> 18:17.040
of trying to reach out to contacts and sort all that out.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.480
I mean, this couldn't be true, right?

18:18.480 --> 18:19.640
How could it be true?

18:19.640 --> 18:20.840
It just seems impossible,

18:20.840 --> 18:22.400
because that must be like 10 years ago now.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.280
That's, it's unbelievable.

18:24.280 --> 18:27.760
And it, in a way, it feels like it's built more momentum

18:27.760 --> 18:29.600
in the last three to four years

18:29.600 --> 18:32.600
than it had for all nine of them.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.480
And we were just on the precipice

18:34.480 --> 18:37.520
of the Steam Deck being released.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.040
And we also just got updated from BattlEye,

18:40.040 --> 18:41.960
the anti-cheat folks,

18:41.960 --> 18:44.000
that it looks like support is in good shape

18:44.000 --> 18:46.600
with the new Proton experimental version.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.600
And it doesn't, I don't know

18:47.600 --> 18:49.360
if it's actually shipped to people yet,

18:49.360 --> 18:53.000
but the takeaway from it is truly that BattlEye,

18:53.000 --> 18:54.440
and what was the other one?

18:54.440 --> 18:55.600
Oh, Easy Anti-Cheat?

18:55.600 --> 18:57.760
Yeah, so both BattlEye and Easy Anti-Cheat

18:57.760 --> 18:59.640
have done their updates.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.200
And you know what, I'm pretty impressed.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.480
And then last but not least,

19:02.480 --> 19:03.760
we don't need to spend a lot of time on this,

19:03.760 --> 19:05.760
but I just think it's totally worth a mention

19:05.760 --> 19:08.160
because of the incredible effort that's been going into

19:08.160 --> 19:10.440
a brand new calendar application.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.000
I know it's not, you know, it's not like,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.520
it's not super, super exciting,

19:15.520 --> 19:18.000
but calendar spelled with a K is out.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.080
And this is really looking great.

19:22.080 --> 19:25.120
I mean, Linux needs a solid native calendar application.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.320
There's some out there for sure,

19:27.320 --> 19:29.120
but something that's really competitive.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.280
And this honestly looks like one of them.

19:31.280 --> 19:34.160
And I mean, you guys listen,

19:34.160 --> 19:35.920
I wouldn't be putting it in the show

19:35.920 --> 19:37.880
unless it actually looked really legit.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.000
And I've been following the development

19:39.000 --> 19:39.840
since the very beginning,

19:39.840 --> 19:42.240
and I've been waiting to give them their plug.

19:42.240 --> 19:46.000
And they just put out, I think it's actually 0.1.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.840
I may have misnoted it, but either way,

19:48.840 --> 19:49.680
they have a release now,

19:49.680 --> 19:50.760
and I want you to go check it out

19:50.760 --> 19:52.600
if you need a calendar on Linux.

19:52.600 --> 19:56.480
Linode.com slash unplugged.

19:56.480 --> 19:59.800
Go there to get $100 and 60 day credit on a new account.

19:59.800 --> 20:01.560
And you go there to support the show.

20:01.560 --> 20:03.560
Linode's how we host everything we've built

20:03.560 --> 20:04.920
since going independent.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.600
And I think it could be a secret weapon.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.200
See, as part of these reads,

20:08.200 --> 20:09.880
I'm telling you how we do stuff.

20:09.880 --> 20:12.000
You get to peek behind the factory,

20:12.000 --> 20:14.240
but you can have Linode as your secret weapon.

20:14.240 --> 20:17.000
You can go out there and have 11 data centers,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.280
have 40 gigabit connections coming into your servers,

20:19.280 --> 20:21.840
have brand new MVME storage rolling out

20:21.840 --> 20:23.840
to your block storage,

20:23.840 --> 20:25.800
have object storage that's S3 compatible

20:25.800 --> 20:27.240
that you can rely on.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.520
I mean, that's actually how I kind of think about Linode now

20:29.520 --> 20:32.640
is I think about it as my infrastructure.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.480
It's how I'm gonna build everything going forward.

20:35.480 --> 20:36.320
I've seen the light.

20:36.320 --> 20:39.320
And the knock-on benefits once we've gone all in

20:39.320 --> 20:42.240
have been just fantastic team-wise.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.640
Everybody knows how to use the Linode dashboard.

20:44.640 --> 20:47.680
We can build automations using their API.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.680
And as we start talking about

20:49.680 --> 20:52.400
approaching the JB infrastructure as if it were code

20:52.400 --> 20:55.240
and using things like Ansible or Terraform

20:55.240 --> 20:56.840
or probably not Kubernetes,

20:56.840 --> 20:59.400
but I know some of you out there would wanna use that.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.400
Well, of course, Linode works with all of that.

21:01.400 --> 21:02.880
So it can also be really part

21:02.880 --> 21:05.040
of a multi-cloud strategy as well.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.400
You get 11 data centers to choose from.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.440
And every single service level is backed

21:09.440 --> 21:13.240
by the absolute best customer service in the business.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.280
And I just underscore that because for me,

21:15.280 --> 21:17.320
I'm running my business on Linode.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.360
I mean, it matters too when it's your personal blog

21:19.360 --> 21:22.000
or a gaming server or something like that.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.280
But man, when it really matters,

21:24.280 --> 21:27.280
it's so great to know they've got your back.

21:27.280 --> 21:30.600
Every step of the way since 2003, Linode's asked themselves,

21:30.600 --> 21:33.520
how do we really use Linux to accomplish this task?

21:33.520 --> 21:35.440
They've really innovated in that area,

21:35.440 --> 21:38.040
starting with the early days of virtualization in Linux

21:38.040 --> 21:40.080
to networking and user interfaces

21:40.080 --> 21:42.280
and so many other things that really have,

21:42.280 --> 21:45.160
we just kinda, we take as obvious now

21:45.160 --> 21:47.520
and Linode was at the very early steps of that stuff

21:47.520 --> 21:50.320
because they're geeks, they're into this stuff.

21:50.320 --> 21:51.920
I can really kinda connect with that.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.200
That and the fact that they're independently owned

21:54.200 --> 21:56.040
and independently funded.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.400
That's huge for me.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.160
So head over to linode.com slash unplugged.

22:00.160 --> 22:02.360
Go get that $100 in 60 day credit

22:02.360 --> 22:04.120
and try this stuff out for yourself.

22:04.120 --> 22:05.920
See what we've been talking about.

22:05.920 --> 22:08.920
See why so many listeners of the show

22:08.920 --> 22:10.000
have been trying it out.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.160
I mean, think about that for a moment.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.360
You think Linode would still be here

22:12.360 --> 22:14.760
if people weren't still trying it out and sticking around?

22:14.760 --> 22:16.800
Thousands of Linux Unplugged customers

22:16.800 --> 22:19.000
have signed up for Linode and are loving it.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.840
Go see what you think and get $100 and support the show.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.960
Linode.com slash unplugged.

22:23.960 --> 22:27.320
Unplugged.

22:27.320 --> 22:29.320
Well, the video we've all been waiting for,

22:29.320 --> 22:32.080
dreading maybe, it's finally here.

22:32.080 --> 22:35.480
The latest on Linus's adventures with Linux.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.000
Yeah, it's titled Linux Hates Me.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.200
So you can probably guess how it went.

22:40.200 --> 22:44.040
It's Linus and Luke over at Linus Tech Tips.

22:44.040 --> 22:45.560
We've been really resisting the urge

22:45.560 --> 22:47.120
to talk too much about this on the show

22:47.120 --> 22:49.040
because, you know, it doesn't,

22:49.040 --> 22:51.320
it's not gonna have much impact

22:51.320 --> 22:52.760
beyond day to day life right now.

22:52.760 --> 22:55.920
But today, as we recorded the day the video dropped.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.640
And there's a theme that's in the video.

22:58.640 --> 23:02.520
And there's actually a theme that Linus and Luke touched on

23:02.520 --> 23:05.280
in their WAN show that I want to expand on here.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.640
You might be asking if you're not familiar with these guys,

23:07.640 --> 23:09.360
why are we talking about this?

23:09.360 --> 23:11.760
Well, they are in the top 10 channels on YouTube.

23:11.760 --> 23:12.920
So they have a very large audience

23:12.920 --> 23:15.720
and they are the number one tech channel on YouTube.

23:15.720 --> 23:17.160
And they are doing potentially up

23:17.160 --> 23:20.480
to a five part Linux challenge

23:20.480 --> 23:24.080
in front of their ginormous YouTube audience.

23:24.080 --> 23:27.120
So it's a pretty big milestone for Linux

23:27.120 --> 23:31.120
in terms of tech coverage and new potential audience.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.880
So there's a theme in there that I thought though,

23:32.880 --> 23:34.160
I'd like to pull out.

23:34.160 --> 23:37.680
Because I think if you watch this first video,

23:37.680 --> 23:39.760
it bit Linus and it caused him

23:39.760 --> 23:41.240
to sort of rush through something

23:41.240 --> 23:44.720
and end up actually wrecking his Pop OS install.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.600
And we've all heard it before.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.480
Once you go command line, you've gone bust.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.920
I have a quick example from a recent WAN show.

23:52.920 --> 23:55.200
So my bottom line on this,

23:55.200 --> 23:57.280
my take and you can hate me for it,

23:57.280 --> 24:00.560
is that the Linux community needs to stop relying

24:00.560 --> 24:02.240
on the command line as a crutch

24:02.240 --> 24:06.560
for creating user experiences that are actually usable.

24:06.560 --> 24:10.400
They can't just say, well, the GUI doesn't need to do this

24:10.400 --> 24:12.640
because it can just be done in the command line.

24:12.640 --> 24:15.840
Because until that attitude changes,

24:15.840 --> 24:17.360
I'm never gonna be able to get

24:17.360 --> 24:19.480
my brother-in-law using Linux.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.200
And I think it's pretty understandable

24:21.200 --> 24:26.200
why people outside Linux would be sort of,

24:26.840 --> 24:29.200
I don't know what's the right word, anti-command line.

24:29.200 --> 24:33.200
They'd be sort of skeptical of using the command line.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.080
There's a whole vocabulary on the command line

24:35.080 --> 24:35.920
that you have to know.

24:35.920 --> 24:39.440
You have to know how to even start to invoke things.

24:39.440 --> 24:41.280
There's really no reference point where to start.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.840
Just a scary blank black box, right?

24:43.840 --> 24:45.280
What do I even type into this thing?

24:45.280 --> 24:46.520
Yeah, exactly.

24:46.520 --> 24:47.640
It's not obvious, is it?

24:47.640 --> 24:50.480
Especially if you've never used a command line before.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.600
Yeah, and you compare that to the sort of

24:52.600 --> 24:54.840
default discoverability of a lot of GUIs, right?

24:54.840 --> 24:55.920
Where you sort of just like, well, all right,

24:55.920 --> 24:57.920
there's a file menu or there's a whole bunch of buttons.

24:57.920 --> 25:00.480
Now you still may not know what they do exactly,

25:00.480 --> 25:02.200
but you can at least see that they're there

25:02.200 --> 25:03.600
as an option to use.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.880
And I think also there's an appeal to the idea

25:05.880 --> 25:08.480
that something can be automatically done by a wizard

25:08.480 --> 25:09.480
or you check a box.

25:09.480 --> 25:11.640
And there are benefits obvious to a GUI

25:11.640 --> 25:13.040
when you're looking at the settings.

25:13.040 --> 25:15.160
It's great to see the check boxes

25:15.160 --> 25:17.360
and the dropdown menu with your different choices.

25:17.360 --> 25:19.800
And it gives you an idea of what is capable.

25:19.800 --> 25:22.960
So there's clear advantages to the GUI.

25:22.960 --> 25:26.000
But I think what we should do is try to build a culture

25:26.000 --> 25:30.040
that embraces learning the command line over time.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.680
I think what we need to work out is this.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.440
Once you go command line, you go broke.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.480
Once you're gone command line, you've lost.

25:35.480 --> 25:37.400
Like we have to get this mentality away

25:37.400 --> 25:39.960
because there's a couple of realities

25:39.960 --> 25:41.880
when dealing with Linux.

25:41.880 --> 25:44.440
And that is that GUI interfaces change frequently.

25:44.440 --> 25:48.720
And the command line syntax changes much, much,

25:48.720 --> 25:50.120
much less often.

25:50.120 --> 25:53.280
Some command line syntax doesn't change for like 20, 30 years.

25:53.280 --> 25:54.960
And so when you go look up a guide online

25:54.960 --> 25:57.680
or a how-to article, the command syntax,

25:57.680 --> 25:59.720
even if this article was written in 2008,

25:59.720 --> 26:01.720
is probably still the same.

26:01.720 --> 26:04.760
But if that article is written in 2008, 2015,

26:04.760 --> 26:08.040
even 2018, 2019, and it's telling you how to do something

26:08.040 --> 26:10.360
in the GUI and Linux, there's a very good chance

26:10.360 --> 26:12.840
it's out of date or you're using a different GUI

26:12.840 --> 26:14.240
because there's a lot of GUIs.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.040
Yeah, this thing doesn't even mention Flutter.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.280
What am I supposed to do?

26:17.280 --> 26:19.120
Right, and maybe I'm on Plasma,

26:19.120 --> 26:21.440
but the guide was written for GNOME.

26:21.440 --> 26:24.120
The other thing about the command line,

26:24.120 --> 26:27.200
the command line syntax can be spoken.

26:27.200 --> 26:31.160
I can say do ls tac lh.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.960
It's a little bit harder to actually walk you through

26:32.960 --> 26:35.400
how to sort your file manager by date

26:35.400 --> 26:37.760
if somebody's completely new to it.

26:37.760 --> 26:41.360
Additionally, the command line can be copied and pasted.

26:41.360 --> 26:44.440
So if you're doing remote support for somebody,

26:44.440 --> 26:46.760
you're in a Telegram session, a chat session, whatever,

26:46.760 --> 26:48.280
you could send them the command

26:48.280 --> 26:50.000
or they could look up a command.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.920
And the reality is the command line's actually

26:52.920 --> 26:55.280
one of the very best things about Linux.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.160
I mean, the command line is what sold a lot of MacBooks

26:57.160 --> 27:00.680
back in the day when they switched over to Mac OS 10.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.920
Command line is a lot more approachable

27:03.920 --> 27:05.760
when you're doing any kind of remote session.

27:05.760 --> 27:07.480
Command line is a lot more clear.

27:07.480 --> 27:10.120
It can be spoken, it can be read, it can be typed.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.160
It's consistent, right?

27:12.160 --> 27:14.560
There's no like trying to, you've all probably,

27:14.560 --> 27:16.040
I imagine most listeners of this show

27:16.040 --> 27:18.560
have had to try to walk somebody through doing something

27:18.560 --> 27:20.480
in a GUI when you can't see their screen.

27:20.480 --> 27:22.520
And then there's the realities of Linux.

27:22.520 --> 27:25.840
To me, and I mean, this is an area I'd love some input on,

27:25.840 --> 27:28.000
but it doesn't seem like we're ever gonna have

27:28.000 --> 27:29.840
a GUI tool for everything.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.080
It moves fast.

27:31.080 --> 27:35.240
Linux and all its tools and abilities come quick.

27:35.240 --> 27:39.520
And GUI tools, especially ones that are good, move slow.

27:39.520 --> 27:41.360
So there will always be gaps.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.240
There are always gonna be things that roll out

27:43.240 --> 27:45.080
that only work on the command line.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.880
We'll have a lot of good tools, but we can't have everything.

27:47.880 --> 27:52.600
So I feel like we ought to try to change the perception

27:52.600 --> 27:55.360
in some way about command lines.

27:55.360 --> 27:56.840
They are user-friendly.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.320
They are new user-friendly specifically.

28:00.680 --> 28:03.120
We have to make them less scary.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.320
Am I off the mark here?

28:05.360 --> 28:07.560
Everybody give me your thoughts.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.400
Start with you, Brent.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.960
So tell me, what are your thoughts on this?

28:09.960 --> 28:13.160
I have several and they don't necessarily all agree.

28:14.920 --> 28:19.920
One of them is my experience a long time ago with Mac OS.

28:20.680 --> 28:21.880
I think many of us would agree

28:21.880 --> 28:24.160
that the Mac user interface is pretty friendly.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.680
And a lot of people who aren't power users

28:25.680 --> 28:27.380
using that pretty successfully.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.600
But the best thing about the Mac for me

28:30.600 --> 28:35.600
was the ability to go from using the visual tools

28:35.600 --> 28:38.880
to growing as a computer user

28:38.880 --> 28:42.800
and then being able to access the command line stuff

28:42.800 --> 28:44.940
to play even more and accomplish things

28:44.940 --> 28:49.940
that the visual interface had never intended me to be doing.

28:50.400 --> 28:54.000
Now that's one of the reasons I got off Mac OS to Linux.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.400
But I think it's a nice transition

28:56.400 --> 29:00.880
into being more of an adventurous user.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.600
If you're interested in the inner workings

29:02.600 --> 29:03.520
of computers and stuff,

29:03.520 --> 29:08.200
I think the explicit nature of how the command line works

29:08.200 --> 29:11.120
is great for understanding the underpinnings

29:11.120 --> 29:13.360
of how your computer works.

29:13.360 --> 29:16.240
I think visually, there's a lot of obfuscation

29:16.240 --> 29:18.800
of how all the stuff that's happening in the background

29:18.800 --> 29:20.300
where the command line sort of exposes that

29:20.300 --> 29:22.160
in a really nice way, at least for my brain,

29:22.160 --> 29:24.360
worked really, really well as a teaching tool

29:24.360 --> 29:25.540
and still does every day.

29:25.540 --> 29:27.280
And I think a point I take away

29:27.280 --> 29:30.440
is even the commercial operating systems,

29:30.440 --> 29:33.080
you end up using the command line from time to time.

29:33.080 --> 29:35.560
It's not like this is only a Linux problem.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.760
If you wanna edit some P list on a Mac

29:37.760 --> 29:39.960
or you wanna do something on Windows

29:39.960 --> 29:41.680
that requires reloading the service,

29:41.680 --> 29:44.460
the quickest way to do it is from the command line.

29:44.460 --> 29:46.600
So Bight, I wanted to give you a chance to jump in.

29:46.600 --> 29:49.320
I have a friend that as soon as you tell him

29:49.320 --> 29:53.560
he needs to open a command line, he goes hyperventilating.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.220
He goes almost into shock by,

29:56.220 --> 29:58.280
oh no, the command line, I don't know what to do.

29:58.280 --> 29:59.760
Well, I think that's actually what happened

29:59.760 --> 30:00.840
to Linus in this video.

30:00.840 --> 30:03.120
He's trying to install something

30:03.120 --> 30:05.520
and he kind of goes into a fugue state

30:05.520 --> 30:07.480
and just rushes through the command line experience

30:07.480 --> 30:09.640
because he just wants it over as fast as possible.

30:09.640 --> 30:10.560
And we've been there, right?

30:10.560 --> 30:11.860
I mean, I've definitely been there.

30:11.860 --> 30:14.240
And it's also that with the command line,

30:14.240 --> 30:18.120
you usually need to know what the syntax is,

30:18.120 --> 30:22.420
what your options are, in what order.

30:22.420 --> 30:24.000
And with a graphical user interface,

30:24.000 --> 30:25.560
you get that all handed to you.

30:25.560 --> 30:28.080
You get only your available options.

30:28.080 --> 30:30.760
You have just the options in front of you

30:30.760 --> 30:33.240
at that moment in time.

30:33.240 --> 30:37.040
And the thing is that with the terminal user interfaces,

30:37.040 --> 30:39.720
those have evolved quite a bit

30:39.720 --> 30:44.720
because if you're looking at some setups for terminals,

30:45.680 --> 30:50.240
those are usually quite graphical for being in a terminal.

30:50.240 --> 30:52.320
But yeah, being open source,

30:52.320 --> 30:55.640
it's also, again, there are many forms of that

30:55.640 --> 30:58.920
and there isn't a baseline in there

30:58.920 --> 31:00.760
except the command line itself.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.320
Standard, yeah.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.280
I wonder too, Wes, like, could that be an area

31:04.280 --> 31:07.360
where some distros could kind of push forward a little bit?

31:07.360 --> 31:09.320
Is take some of this stuff

31:09.320 --> 31:11.700
that makes the command line a little slicker,

31:11.700 --> 31:14.280
that auto figures out what you're trying to do a little bit.

31:14.280 --> 31:16.600
Is that part of maybe the solution?

31:16.600 --> 31:17.980
Yeah, I don't think any of this is to say

31:17.980 --> 31:20.640
that we shouldn't have intuitive GUI systems.

31:20.640 --> 31:21.480
And at the same time,

31:21.480 --> 31:24.460
that we can't improve the command line user experience,

31:24.460 --> 31:25.300
right?

31:25.300 --> 31:28.520
Like, there's a lot that can be done better.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.680
You know, like we were just using an NC do in the studio

31:30.680 --> 31:31.520
the other day, Chris,

31:31.520 --> 31:34.800
and that's a thing that happens in a terminal,

31:34.800 --> 31:37.680
but it's a lot less scary than some of the other options.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.720
But it doesn't need maybe the same complicated maintenance

31:39.720 --> 31:42.680
that a whole graphical GUI does to do the same task.

31:42.680 --> 31:45.080
So I think there might be some sweet spots in between

31:45.080 --> 31:47.040
where we can have some better methods

31:47.040 --> 31:48.680
to introduce people to the command line

31:48.680 --> 31:50.480
because there's that part where, you know,

31:50.480 --> 31:52.520
you're almost having a conversation back and forth

31:52.520 --> 31:55.640
with a computer and in some ways it can be simpler.

31:55.640 --> 32:00.400
I agree that we could have as good a desktop experience

32:00.400 --> 32:02.640
on Linux as, you know,

32:02.640 --> 32:05.120
people that are super familiar with Windows or Mac OS

32:05.120 --> 32:06.800
have on those platforms.

32:06.800 --> 32:09.160
But I don't think we should pursue that

32:09.160 --> 32:12.600
and forsake, you know, the command line in the process

32:12.600 --> 32:16.300
because the command line is the super user's

32:16.300 --> 32:18.740
killer macro feature.

32:18.740 --> 32:21.920
And it's also Linux's USP.

32:21.920 --> 32:24.200
We have that, nobody else does.

32:24.200 --> 32:26.840
And that's why Linux runs the world right now

32:26.840 --> 32:30.940
because it isn't bound to a graphical user interface.

32:30.940 --> 32:32.960
So I think we should keep it

32:32.960 --> 32:35.720
and we should make the terminal experience better

32:35.720 --> 32:38.640
and we should have more terminal utilities and tools

32:38.640 --> 32:40.360
to supercharge our experience there.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.280
But there's no reason why we can't have a slick UI

32:42.280 --> 32:43.440
on top as well.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.760
Yeah, I wanna encourage people

32:45.760 --> 32:47.600
to look at the command line a little differently.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.740
And I've been trying to think about legitimately

32:49.740 --> 32:52.160
how we could do it on this show.

32:52.160 --> 32:54.960
And I think talking about tools like NCDU

32:54.960 --> 32:57.820
or just talking about that kind of stuff

32:57.820 --> 33:00.620
a little more frequently might help a little bit.

33:00.620 --> 33:03.100
And so Wimpy, if I could get your permission,

33:03.100 --> 33:06.120
I'd like to continue on the command line love segment

33:06.120 --> 33:07.500
from time to time here in the show

33:07.500 --> 33:10.400
to sort of inspired by the Ubuntu podcast,

33:10.400 --> 33:12.660
carried on with respect and love

33:12.660 --> 33:14.600
and feature a command line tool from time to time

33:14.600 --> 33:17.420
here in the show to try to, you know, not push people,

33:17.420 --> 33:19.320
not be pushy, not do that kind of thing,

33:19.320 --> 33:20.620
but just walk people through cool stuff

33:20.620 --> 33:21.880
you can do on the command line

33:21.880 --> 33:23.200
and say it's out there if you want it.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.920
Yeah, that well is very deep.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.160
You will never gonna run out of, you know,

33:27.160 --> 33:29.240
love for the command line there.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.480
No, so I mean, it's inspired,

33:31.480 --> 33:33.440
I admit completely by the Ubuntu podcast.

33:33.440 --> 33:36.760
The command line love segment was great.

33:36.760 --> 33:37.800
And so from time to time,

33:37.800 --> 33:39.720
I should have thought of one for today,

33:39.720 --> 33:41.520
but that's just thinking about this.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.200
I guess we'll make it NCDU.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.520
But I just, something we could do

33:44.520 --> 33:46.360
to put a focus on great command line tools

33:46.360 --> 33:47.880
so you can give us some of your ideas

33:47.880 --> 33:50.280
at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

33:50.280 --> 33:53.440
And you know, maybe tools that we already have

33:53.440 --> 33:54.920
that we could just use a little better.

33:54.920 --> 33:56.280
Things we've forgotten about

33:56.280 --> 33:58.220
that still need a little bit of love.

33:58.220 --> 34:00.180
There's a ton of that stuff.

34:00.180 --> 34:02.940
Speaking of things we've forgotten about,

34:02.940 --> 34:07.400
we have a couple of new options up at jupytergarage.com.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.000
Some random swag bags are back,

34:09.000 --> 34:13.040
including old swag and some new swag from the road trip,

34:13.040 --> 34:15.120
some new stickers, some old stickers,

34:15.120 --> 34:18.040
bonus road trip swag items at jupytergarage.com.

34:18.040 --> 34:19.740
The swag bag is back.

34:19.740 --> 34:22.680
We also, for $5 more,

34:22.680 --> 34:26.080
have a random swag bag with the Jupiter journal.

34:26.080 --> 34:28.000
So it's the same great random swag bag,

34:28.000 --> 34:32.040
but we also are including a limited edition JB notebook.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.800
It's got the rocket pressed in on it.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.000
It's really nice, it's a good size.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.480
And we'll include that in the swag bag with journal

34:38.480 --> 34:39.880
for $5 more.

34:39.880 --> 34:42.600
Or you could just go grab the journal if you want.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.080
You pay a little bit for it.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.680
Well, not really, it's like seven or eight bucks.

34:45.680 --> 34:48.020
It's pretty much what the cost is.

34:48.020 --> 34:50.040
But you can pick your color if you just buy the journal

34:50.040 --> 34:52.120
by itself, because there is a blue version

34:52.120 --> 34:53.320
and a gray version.

34:53.320 --> 34:55.920
It's nice, it's great for taking notes.

34:55.920 --> 34:58.680
It lays flat, I love it a lot.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.220
And then just for fun, because it's the winter,

35:01.220 --> 35:04.760
I've also added a bearded tux bomber jacket.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.400
It's pretty nice, it's low key.

35:07.400 --> 35:09.440
It didn't want it to shout that you're a geek,

35:09.440 --> 35:11.040
but I wanted a nice subtle low key

35:11.040 --> 35:12.920
where you could still fly your geek flag

35:12.920 --> 35:15.200
without making a big fuss about it.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.360
And so the bearded tux bomber jacket

35:17.360 --> 35:19.440
is also up at jupytergarage.com.

35:19.440 --> 35:21.360
So two new random swag bags.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.560
There's not a ton, but we have at least enough

35:23.560 --> 35:25.580
to do 10 right now, I think.

35:25.580 --> 35:27.080
And they'll go quick.

35:27.080 --> 35:29.280
And then we will ship out what we've got.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.320
We'll check both.

35:31.320 --> 35:34.960
I got two different swag caches

35:34.960 --> 35:37.480
that were sent to me since the road trip.

35:37.480 --> 35:38.720
So we ended up with a bunch more

35:38.720 --> 35:40.600
so we can do some more swag bags.

35:40.600 --> 35:44.760
And the journal just, it turned out great.

35:44.760 --> 35:46.120
It's something I set up a while ago

35:46.120 --> 35:47.440
and I've been waiting for the right moment

35:47.440 --> 35:48.600
and it just seems like now is it.

35:48.600 --> 35:51.440
So if I were you, I'd spend the extra five bucks

35:51.440 --> 35:52.360
and get the one with the journal

35:52.360 --> 35:54.720
or go grab a journal directly.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.280
There's not a ton of any of this stuff

35:56.280 --> 35:59.120
because we're not a big warehouse.

35:59.120 --> 36:02.620
So go to jupytergarage.com and go grab some of that stuff

36:02.620 --> 36:07.200
because I like all of it a lot, including that jacket.

36:07.200 --> 36:09.480
Might be all I'm wearing right now as a matter of fact.

36:09.480 --> 36:12.920
And we'll do a little housekeeping.

36:12.920 --> 36:15.880
Go check out Linux Action News 214.

36:15.880 --> 36:18.600
We busted some thick Red Hat FUD this week

36:18.600 --> 36:22.360
and we chatted about a new Ubuntu desktop tool in the works,

36:22.360 --> 36:25.600
a brand new tool written in Flutter for the Ubuntu desktop.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.000
Covered that a little bit.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.920
And don't miss Self-Hosted 57.

36:30.800 --> 36:35.080
Alex is building a Self-Hosted Notion Notes replacement.

36:35.080 --> 36:38.260
He's just getting that started and it's awesome.

36:38.260 --> 36:39.720
And he also shares the story

36:39.720 --> 36:42.980
of how he accidentally deleted his server disk setup.

36:42.980 --> 36:47.760
Oh, I got him to share that on the show.

36:47.760 --> 36:51.680
So that's Self-Hosted.show.57 if you'd like that.

36:51.680 --> 36:54.560
Thank you to our members at unpluggedcore.com.

36:54.560 --> 36:55.740
I'm gonna go there after the show today

36:55.740 --> 36:58.700
and plug in the member discount, same promo code as before.

36:58.700 --> 37:01.040
So you can take a little money off our original swag items.

37:01.040 --> 37:03.060
The bags, they're just sold at cost,

37:03.060 --> 37:06.020
but the jacket and whatnot, the new original swag stuff.

37:06.020 --> 37:09.000
Members get a little bit off that merch, unpluggedcore.com.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.620
You also get two feeds to choose from,

37:10.620 --> 37:13.420
a full live stream edition.

37:13.420 --> 37:15.520
We run it through some compressor, but that's about it.

37:15.520 --> 37:18.800
It's just everything uncut, every mistake, everything.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.400
Or you can get a limited ad feed.

37:21.400 --> 37:24.300
Nice tight production, just less ads.

37:24.300 --> 37:25.480
And you support the show.

37:25.480 --> 37:27.520
Unpluggedcore.com.

37:27.520 --> 37:31.120
And we'd love your feedback at linuxunplug.com slash contact

37:31.120 --> 37:34.560
and linuxunplug.com slash matrix for our matrix community.

37:34.560 --> 37:37.600
And last but not least,

37:37.600 --> 37:40.240
join the love plug this Sunday and every Sunday

37:40.240 --> 37:43.480
at linuxunplug.com slash mumble for details on that.

37:43.480 --> 37:47.160
It's at noon Pacific, jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

37:48.020 --> 37:48.860
for that.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.680
We have some feedback this week, quite a bit of it.

37:53.680 --> 37:56.520
Akseli got tired of the Windows 10 update

37:56.520 --> 37:58.560
and gave Linux a try.

37:58.560 --> 38:03.560
He writes, here's a very long, enthusiastic ramble

38:03.740 --> 38:06.940
I wrote about Linux and I just really wanted to share.

38:06.940 --> 38:10.100
To start, I'm not completely new to using Linux though.

38:10.100 --> 38:12.600
Since I installed my first Linux on my Xbox,

38:12.600 --> 38:14.720
the classic first one.

38:14.720 --> 38:17.180
I've also tinkered with it every now and then

38:17.180 --> 38:18.320
with my other devices,

38:18.320 --> 38:20.840
but never really fully committed to it.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.280
That changed this summer.

38:22.280 --> 38:24.120
I was tired of Windows 10 updates,

38:24.120 --> 38:26.360
but most importantly, I read all around the internet

38:26.360 --> 38:29.860
that games are now working better and better on Linux.

38:29.860 --> 38:33.000
Now I like gaming a lot and I also like making games

38:33.000 --> 38:36.240
and I felt like it's now or never, I gotta try this.

38:36.240 --> 38:39.760
I got myself a Kubuntu ISO and did the switch.

38:39.760 --> 38:41.960
Although I left my Windows 10 installation

38:41.960 --> 38:43.480
on my other drive.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.040
Probably good thinking.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.040
Yet here I am almost six months later

38:47.040 --> 38:49.800
and I haven't touched my Windows installation at all.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.000
I've rediscovered my enthusiasm for computers

38:52.000 --> 38:54.440
due to being able to actually look inside of everything

38:54.440 --> 38:56.160
to see how things work.

38:56.160 --> 38:58.040
I can fix my issues myself.

38:58.040 --> 39:00.180
As an example, myself and some others on GitHub

39:00.180 --> 39:03.620
figured out how to fix the GSP 670 headset

39:03.620 --> 39:06.000
to make it work properly on Linux.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.120
And now that fix is in the kernel.

39:08.120 --> 39:10.760
On Windows, I would have had to wait

39:10.760 --> 39:12.700
for the manufacturer to fix the issues,

39:12.700 --> 39:14.360
but on Linux, we just rolled up our sleeves

39:14.360 --> 39:16.240
and began to figure things out.

39:16.240 --> 39:19.240
All the games I play from Eevee Online to Quake Champions

39:19.240 --> 39:21.860
work really well thanks to Steam Proton

39:21.860 --> 39:23.100
and that it's big for me.

39:24.060 --> 39:26.540
Sure, there are some issues sometimes,

39:26.540 --> 39:28.020
but then the community for the game

39:28.020 --> 39:30.440
will either butt heads together and figure things out

39:30.440 --> 39:32.760
or work with the developers if they're chill enough

39:32.760 --> 39:35.040
and soon we're back to gaming.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.720
On the game dev side, I've felt way more productive too.

39:37.720 --> 39:39.760
Unity works really well on Linux.

39:39.760 --> 39:42.240
I started learning how to use NeoVim.

39:42.240 --> 39:43.400
I really, really love it.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.360
And my open source game project

39:45.360 --> 39:47.720
is much, much easier to work on in Linux

39:47.720 --> 39:50.480
since C development is much easier to set up.

39:50.480 --> 39:53.400
Here's a link to his game called XMO Game.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.480
He continues, I also created a tool

39:56.480 --> 39:58.440
for Elder Scrolls Online players,

39:58.440 --> 40:01.600
a native GTK app that downloads add-ons for the game

40:01.600 --> 40:04.740
since the semi-official tools don't really work with wine.

40:04.740 --> 40:06.820
It's not as feature rich,

40:06.820 --> 40:09.780
but it makes the add-on updating way easier.

40:09.780 --> 40:13.400
That's ESOLinux add-on manager, we'll link to that.

40:13.400 --> 40:15.940
And he continues, just being able to contribute

40:15.940 --> 40:18.540
to a community of computer enthusiasts like this,

40:18.540 --> 40:21.200
just doing things and helping each other.

40:21.200 --> 40:23.080
I hope I can contribute to the Linux community

40:23.080 --> 40:24.680
in the future too, and my future games

40:24.680 --> 40:26.520
will be made Linux first.

40:26.520 --> 40:28.600
All in all, I'm super happy that I switched to Linux.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.440
I haven't had this much fun using my computer

40:30.440 --> 40:33.360
for a long time, and I think it's pretty much all thanks

40:33.360 --> 40:36.120
to gaming being way more possible on Linux now

40:36.120 --> 40:38.200
since it is a very big part of my life.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.880
Oh, that's just great.

40:39.880 --> 40:42.320
You know, I love that sentiment that you have this fun

40:42.320 --> 40:44.680
and excitement and discovery as you're trying out Linux.

40:44.680 --> 40:46.040
I mean, you can have the bad sides too, right?

40:46.040 --> 40:49.320
And maybe this LTT video is some of the dark side to that

40:49.320 --> 40:51.000
when you have to do that and you don't,

40:51.000 --> 40:52.680
you haven't really opted into it.

40:52.680 --> 40:54.280
But the upsides are, yeah, if you're interested

40:54.280 --> 40:56.880
in this stuff, you know, in the Linux world,

40:56.880 --> 40:59.600
it's all exposed for you to learn about if you want.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.480
Yeah, just enjoy the process, right?

41:01.480 --> 41:03.840
Don't rush it, don't make it a challenge

41:03.840 --> 41:05.760
where you give yourself a timeline.

41:05.760 --> 41:06.840
Don't do that stuff.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.040
Well, and it sounds to me like it's building a community

41:09.040 --> 41:11.640
behind these games of a very different sort

41:11.640 --> 41:13.880
than just players, but also developers.

41:13.880 --> 41:15.920
And that's kind of really fascinating to me.

41:15.920 --> 41:18.720
So we got a lot of folks, like a handful,

41:18.720 --> 41:20.920
a bushel of that wrote in and said,

41:20.920 --> 41:23.600
we should try out Silverblue or KinoKnight.

41:23.600 --> 41:26.800
So that is on our list of kind of to-do.

41:26.800 --> 41:28.520
We kind of have a list right now of items

41:28.520 --> 41:31.440
because we also have our server that we need to work on.

41:31.440 --> 41:34.040
We have the router, firewall, VPN box

41:34.040 --> 41:34.920
that we still need to build.

41:34.920 --> 41:36.360
We got projects, baby.

41:36.360 --> 41:37.360
Yeah, we do.

41:37.360 --> 41:39.040
And it's just parts that are coming in slowly,

41:39.040 --> 41:41.160
but surely they are arriving right now.

41:41.160 --> 41:43.880
And so we may, you know, maybe after that,

41:43.880 --> 41:46.240
we may revisit Silverblue or KinoKnight.

41:46.240 --> 41:47.680
I could see that.

41:47.680 --> 41:49.200
People thought, you know, give it a real go

41:49.200 --> 41:52.040
is what they was the general sentiment is,

41:52.040 --> 41:53.960
you know, don't just look at it,

41:53.960 --> 41:56.680
but really give it a go and live with it for a bit,

41:56.680 --> 41:59.520
which I would be down for that when the time was right.

41:59.520 --> 42:03.040
I had a discussion with George Castro along those lines

42:03.040 --> 42:07.040
on Thursday or Friday last, Thursday last week,

42:07.040 --> 42:08.760
where we were sort of saying, you know,

42:08.760 --> 42:11.840
this is where people need to be setting their minds

42:11.840 --> 42:14.360
to what the future of, you know,

42:14.360 --> 42:15.920
the Linux desktop looks like.

42:15.920 --> 42:19.560
And we were looking at Fedora, Silverblue,

42:19.560 --> 42:22.400
and then using containers for all the messy stuff

42:22.400 --> 42:24.680
that we do, you know, software development,

42:24.680 --> 42:27.360
playing games and all of that sort of thing.

42:27.360 --> 42:29.480
So yeah, Silverblue plus Toolbox

42:29.480 --> 42:32.800
is a fairly potent offering.

42:32.800 --> 42:35.040
I'm very keen on NixOS for similar, you know,

42:35.040 --> 42:36.840
for similar reasons.

42:36.840 --> 42:37.680
Yeah.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.680
I am happy to hear you say that, Wimpy,

42:39.680 --> 42:41.720
because that has been my observation as well.

42:41.720 --> 42:44.320
And, you know, we kind of watch this stuff

42:44.320 --> 42:48.120
and I feel like there has been a lot more chatter

42:48.120 --> 42:51.720
about Silverblue with the Fedora 35 release

42:51.720 --> 42:52.880
than in previous releases.

42:52.880 --> 42:57.200
Like it seems to me, awareness is really picking up.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.000
And I think a lot more people are starting to see it

42:59.000 --> 43:00.920
the way you see it, Wimpy, and seeing it as

43:00.920 --> 43:03.240
this is probably the way things need to go

43:03.240 --> 43:05.800
for a really robust workstation.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.000
And so I get that,

43:07.000 --> 43:10.040
which means we probably should give it a really solid go.

43:10.040 --> 43:13.560
I also saw an Ubuntu effort along this line

43:13.560 --> 43:14.840
that's also using OSTree.

43:14.840 --> 43:17.760
I don't think it's using Ubuntu core has launched.

43:17.760 --> 43:19.640
I don't know, I don't think it's official,

43:19.640 --> 43:22.680
but I don't know if you saw that go by the internets.

43:22.680 --> 43:25.480
We also, as a last bit of feedback for this week,

43:25.480 --> 43:28.840
we got a letter from listener Chris.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.960
He writes, Chris, I love Macedon,

43:30.960 --> 43:33.440
but it's not clear to me it's right for you.

43:33.440 --> 43:35.760
You've repeatedly said your goal is to reach your audience

43:35.760 --> 43:38.360
and Twitter in the large or matrix up close and personal

43:38.360 --> 43:40.480
may be your best bets for that.

43:40.480 --> 43:42.560
I love that it's the wild West.

43:42.560 --> 43:44.440
I was temporarily banned from Twitter for saying,

43:44.440 --> 43:45.720
don't shoot yourself in the foot

43:45.720 --> 43:48.120
as allegedly this promoted self-harm.

43:48.120 --> 43:50.760
Macedon reminds me of the nineties internet,

43:50.760 --> 43:53.520
wild, wooly, and full of all kinds of people

43:53.520 --> 43:55.800
with an equally diverse range of beliefs and opinions

43:55.800 --> 43:59.000
and a whole bunch of outstanding technical content,

43:59.000 --> 44:01.080
but you have to be willing to invest the time

44:01.080 --> 44:03.040
and seek it out and engage with it.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.040
Is that for you?

44:04.040 --> 44:05.320
I'm not sure.

44:05.320 --> 44:06.960
Thanks for all you do.

44:06.960 --> 44:10.040
He also says, PS, maybe consider giving the KD spin

44:10.040 --> 44:11.800
a try in fedora 35.

44:11.800 --> 44:14.120
Well, see our last episode for that.

44:14.120 --> 44:16.000
And thanks for listening.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.000
That's right.

44:17.000 --> 44:20.160
I think that's a pretty good take listener, Chris.

44:20.160 --> 44:21.320
I appreciate that.

44:21.320 --> 44:25.200
And I am finding my feet.

44:25.200 --> 44:27.800
I was really bad about matrix this last week.

44:27.800 --> 44:29.960
I kind of messed up somehow in element.

44:29.960 --> 44:30.880
I don't know where I went wrong,

44:30.880 --> 44:32.520
but every room I joined,

44:32.520 --> 44:34.800
my notifications are on by default.

44:34.800 --> 44:37.160
And so I look at my phone sometimes and I'll see like,

44:37.160 --> 44:39.640
I have 30 unread notifications

44:39.640 --> 44:42.240
and I just, I can't bring myself to open it.

44:42.240 --> 44:43.520
That doesn't make you want to check them.

44:43.520 --> 44:44.560
Nope.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.920
But I got that, I caught up.

44:46.920 --> 44:48.720
I'm back current again.

44:48.720 --> 44:52.440
And I do like the conversations I see happening

44:52.440 --> 44:53.680
in that matrix room.

44:53.680 --> 44:54.520
Yeah, me too.

44:54.520 --> 44:55.640
It's some really good,

44:55.640 --> 44:59.000
just organic community discussion about neat tech stuff

44:59.000 --> 45:00.800
and a lot of stuff I might miss otherwise.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.880
Yeah, it's interesting how it's sort of shaking out

45:02.880 --> 45:04.120
right now.

45:04.120 --> 45:07.360
And I don't really know how many days are left

45:07.360 --> 45:08.400
for our IRC room,

45:08.400 --> 45:10.840
because it seems like it pretty much goes to idle,

45:10.840 --> 45:12.680
except for when we're live now,

45:12.680 --> 45:15.800
but the matrix and telegram are popping along all day long.

45:17.120 --> 45:18.760
So we'll see, we'll see.

45:18.760 --> 45:20.800
I mean, I just don't know if I could, why shut it down

45:20.800 --> 45:22.240
when you could, well, we can't bridge it

45:22.240 --> 45:23.960
because of geek shit, I suppose.

45:23.960 --> 45:24.800
Right.

45:24.800 --> 45:28.160
Put a user in there who just hit links to the matrix a lot.

45:28.160 --> 45:29.360
Hey, they're over here.

45:29.360 --> 45:30.200
Hey.

45:31.320 --> 45:32.520
Every five minutes.

45:32.520 --> 45:33.360
Brentpot.

45:34.600 --> 45:37.320
So we have a cut, well, it's like a pick pack.

45:37.320 --> 45:39.240
It's a pick pack for you this week.

45:39.240 --> 45:40.360
A whole pack of picks?

45:40.360 --> 45:41.800
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

45:41.800 --> 45:44.920
A really, really, really awesome,

45:44.920 --> 45:48.680
but complicated backup tool for GNU slash Linux

45:48.680 --> 45:50.440
is Borg Backup.

45:50.440 --> 45:51.280
Yeah.

45:51.280 --> 45:53.600
Talked about it on TechSnap forever ago.

45:53.600 --> 45:54.880
Yeah, you're familiar with it, Wes?

45:54.880 --> 45:55.960
I sure am.

45:55.960 --> 45:59.080
Borg Backup is a really solid, comprehensive,

45:59.080 --> 46:01.120
old schoolish backup solution.

46:01.120 --> 46:04.560
And today, I'm gonna tell you about Vorta.

46:04.560 --> 46:07.760
And Vorta is a desktop client that simplifies Borg Backup

46:07.760 --> 46:10.520
into a pretty easy interface.

46:10.520 --> 46:12.440
It gives you a lot of the same power,

46:12.440 --> 46:14.160
but walks you through setting some of it up.

46:14.160 --> 46:16.600
A great example of where a GUI can take something

46:16.600 --> 46:18.520
and make it discoverable, as a matter of fact.

46:18.520 --> 46:20.520
It helps you manage your encrypted backups,

46:20.520 --> 46:23.360
it does de-duplication, it'll compress the backups.

46:23.360 --> 46:26.240
Of course, it's all open source, works even on Mac OS,

46:26.240 --> 46:31.040
if you wanna backup your Macintosh-based system.

46:31.040 --> 46:32.880
And it's available on Flathub.

46:32.880 --> 46:34.920
If you want a quick install, there's packages available

46:34.920 --> 46:38.520
for your distro of choice, V-O-R-T-A.

46:38.520 --> 46:39.800
Do you recognize the name, Wes?

46:39.800 --> 46:41.040
Oh, I sure do.

46:41.040 --> 46:43.880
Look at them keeping the Star Trek references going.

46:43.880 --> 46:45.840
I mean, I was already pretty fond of this tool,

46:45.840 --> 46:48.640
but now, I'm definitely giving it a go.

46:48.640 --> 46:52.720
Yeah, yeah, I encourage to go over to, if you can,

46:52.720 --> 46:54.480
go over to Flathub and search for Vorta

46:54.480 --> 46:56.440
and just look at the screenshots of it.

46:56.440 --> 46:58.600
It's really straightforward.

46:58.600 --> 47:01.320
It's a little more old school in terms of backup,

47:01.320 --> 47:02.840
but that might be what you're looking for

47:02.840 --> 47:03.920
for this kind of tool.

47:03.920 --> 47:05.640
Well, yeah, and Borg's already something

47:05.640 --> 47:07.520
that I felt comfortable using,

47:07.520 --> 47:10.560
but maybe unless I was totally managing the process,

47:10.560 --> 47:13.400
it might not show up on some of my supported systems

47:13.400 --> 47:14.520
of family or friends or something,

47:14.520 --> 47:16.440
but this adds a new layer on top

47:16.440 --> 47:18.440
that might push that into the next category.

47:18.440 --> 47:19.920
Totally, totally, so go check it out.

47:19.920 --> 47:21.640
We'll have a link in the show notes, all of that.

47:21.640 --> 47:23.560
Everything we talked about today

47:23.560 --> 47:28.520
is linked at linuxonplug.com, slash, four, three, one.

47:28.520 --> 47:30.800
You can get all that good stuff right there.

47:30.800 --> 47:34.720
You'll find links to our profiles over there as well.

47:35.760 --> 47:36.720
We just sort of put it all there.

47:36.720 --> 47:38.640
It makes it easy, you know?

47:38.640 --> 47:39.920
And then, really, all you have to remember

47:39.920 --> 47:41.280
is when we do it live,

47:41.280 --> 47:42.400
because you can always go get everything

47:42.400 --> 47:43.440
we talked about from the website,

47:43.440 --> 47:46.240
but when do they do it live?

47:46.240 --> 47:47.520
When do they do it?

47:47.520 --> 47:48.360
6 a.m.

47:48.360 --> 47:49.760
No, no, well, yeah, where?

47:49.760 --> 47:51.720
It must be 6 a.m. somewhere, right?

47:51.720 --> 47:55.240
Here, we'll do a little, what is it called?

47:55.240 --> 48:00.240
Like neurolinguisty, neurolasagna.

48:00.880 --> 48:02.360
I'm not sure what it's called.

48:02.360 --> 48:04.840
Neurolinguistics, something like that.

48:04.840 --> 48:06.640
I think it's called neurolasagna, that sounds right,

48:06.640 --> 48:08.960
where we will program your brain

48:08.960 --> 48:11.560
by associating it with something else.

48:11.560 --> 48:16.240
So when I say join us live Tuesdays, noon Pacific,

48:16.240 --> 48:17.400
and then you hear.

48:17.400 --> 48:18.680
See you next week.

48:18.680 --> 48:21.280
Same bad time, same bad station.

48:21.280 --> 48:22.920
Now, I'll do that over and over again

48:22.920 --> 48:24.680
for the next three years.

48:24.680 --> 48:26.120
Every time you hear that, you'll think,

48:26.120 --> 48:30.360
ah, Linux Unplugged, Tuesday, noon Pacific,

48:30.360 --> 48:33.680
3 p.m. Eastern, jblive.tv.

48:33.680 --> 48:35.160
I admit, it's gonna take a little while,

48:35.160 --> 48:36.560
but I'm committed to it.

48:36.560 --> 48:38.720
I'll eventually have everyone saying it.

48:38.720 --> 48:42.200
My plan, my ultimate plan, it's been revealed.

48:42.200 --> 48:44.600
I think it's gonna be a huge success.

48:44.600 --> 48:45.520
Thank you so much for joining us

48:45.520 --> 48:47.200
on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

48:47.200 --> 48:48.440
We'd love your feedback, your comments,

48:48.440 --> 48:52.000
your ideas, your picks, your command line tips

48:52.000 --> 48:53.760
for some command line love

48:53.760 --> 48:55.560
at linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

48:55.560 --> 48:57.080
Go there, send them in,

48:57.080 --> 49:00.640
and we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

49:00.640 --> 49:19.640
The Unplugged program is a production of Linux Unplugged.

49:19.640 --> 49:39.880
So I meant to fit this in the show,

49:39.880 --> 49:44.360
but I forgot I do have a slight minor Starlink update.

49:44.360 --> 49:46.840
Number one with a bullet that is bugging me about Starlink

49:46.840 --> 49:48.520
is I have to say it's really unfortunate

49:48.520 --> 49:52.360
that the ethernet cable does not detach from Dishy.

49:52.360 --> 49:54.640
It is permanently plugged into Dishy.

49:54.640 --> 49:56.120
It's baked in?

49:56.120 --> 49:59.720
Yeah, so like when I'm packing up,

49:59.720 --> 50:01.280
I have to like bring in a wet dish

50:01.280 --> 50:03.680
with a wet 100 foot ethernet cord.

50:03.680 --> 50:06.320
And when I wanna run it out my window and all,

50:06.320 --> 50:07.880
it's just, it's not ideal.

50:07.880 --> 50:09.480
It'd be really nice to be able to, you know,

50:09.480 --> 50:11.200
plug it in like an ethernet cable.

50:12.200 --> 50:15.800
The other thing is, is you need to shut it down in the app.

50:15.800 --> 50:17.800
Otherwise you have to kind of forcibly collapse

50:17.800 --> 50:20.200
the leg down and it feels like you're breaking it.

50:21.160 --> 50:23.240
But yeah, that's neither here nor there.

50:23.240 --> 50:24.320
You just gotta remember to shut it down

50:24.320 --> 50:25.240
before you pack it up.

50:25.240 --> 50:27.320
Not many people will be moving it around.

50:27.320 --> 50:29.080
And then the last little thing that I have

50:29.080 --> 50:32.800
just sort of as a followup is you really do have

50:32.800 --> 50:34.280
to update your service address when you move.

50:34.280 --> 50:36.120
I tried to move within the 30 mile radius

50:36.120 --> 50:37.080
and see if it kept working.

50:37.080 --> 50:40.680
And I was just getting poor, poor, poor results.

50:40.680 --> 50:42.800
Went in and updated my service address,

50:42.800 --> 50:44.520
which I was a little nervous to do

50:44.520 --> 50:47.000
because I was worried it would say sorry, no availability.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.480
But it updated just fine.

50:48.480 --> 50:50.840
And then within about 15, 20 minutes,

50:50.840 --> 50:51.800
my service has been great,

50:51.800 --> 50:54.760
even with some blockage from tree leaves.

50:54.760 --> 50:56.080
So it's been really good.

50:56.080 --> 50:57.960
And other than those little minor things,

50:57.960 --> 51:00.280
I'm still really enjoying the StarLinks.

51:00.280 --> 51:02.440
The StarLinks to the internet has been fantastic.

51:02.440 --> 51:03.680
All right, did I stall long enough?

51:03.680 --> 51:04.800
Do we have an arch update?

51:04.800 --> 51:06.760
Oh, we're ready to reboot.

51:06.760 --> 51:08.080
All right, let's do it.

51:08.080 --> 51:08.920
Rebooting.

51:08.920 --> 51:17.440
And it looks like J-Bot's having problems connecting to GeekShed.

51:17.440 --> 51:19.240
All right, we'll see how long that takes.

51:19.240 --> 51:21.520
I'm getting in position to start the pinging.

51:21.520 --> 51:22.880
Ping's in progress.

51:22.880 --> 51:27.760
Oh, man, I should have mentioned in Coda Radio this week,

51:27.760 --> 51:29.600
I did a takedown of Craig Federighi

51:29.600 --> 51:32.560
and this horrible talk that he gave at a web summit

51:32.560 --> 51:35.520
about how dangerous and scary sideloading is.

51:35.520 --> 51:37.800
And the Mac press has not talked about it.

51:37.800 --> 51:39.420
I mean, they announced that it happened.

51:39.420 --> 51:42.600
But nobody's really talked about the contents of his speech.

51:42.600 --> 51:45.600
And it's so cringey.

51:45.600 --> 51:48.120
And it's clearly Apple's new position on sideloading

51:48.120 --> 51:49.960
or firm position.

51:49.960 --> 51:51.540
So I recommend you do actually listen.

51:51.540 --> 51:53.280
So that'll be in Coda Radio tomorrow.

51:53.280 --> 51:55.000
Oh, oh, oh, are we back?

51:55.000 --> 51:56.080
Did we actually ever stop?

51:56.080 --> 51:57.600
That part I'm not sure about.

51:57.600 --> 51:58.720
Is it still shutting down?

51:58.720 --> 52:00.640
Is it just taking a long time to shut down?

52:00.640 --> 52:04.240
Because I don't think it actually stopped pinging.

52:04.240 --> 52:06.080
I tell you what, Wes, this is stressful.

52:06.080 --> 52:08.840
It is stressful.

52:08.840 --> 52:11.760
I was thinking maybe I could jump on the jitzy

52:11.760 --> 52:13.400
and I could go out in the garage.

52:13.400 --> 52:15.760
You should do that anyway.

52:15.760 --> 52:18.680
All right, I mean, this took a little while when

52:18.680 --> 52:20.760
I rebooted before for ZFS.

52:20.760 --> 52:23.160
Hey, whoa, it's Chris.

52:23.160 --> 52:25.000
Chris got a rocking beard, too.

52:25.000 --> 52:26.740
Yeah, his beard's looking great right now.

52:26.740 --> 52:29.440
I don't have any lights out here at the moment.

52:29.440 --> 52:30.840
Is it booted, Wes?

52:30.840 --> 52:31.920
No pings yet.

52:31.920 --> 52:36.160
OK, I'm going in the garage to get a little light.

52:36.160 --> 52:37.680
And I'll go to the console.

52:37.680 --> 52:38.160
We'll see.

52:38.160 --> 52:40.520
This actually works way better than how it normally does,

52:40.520 --> 52:45.120
because you can see Chris's trepidation here.

52:45.120 --> 52:46.920
All right, I'm bringing it up.

52:46.920 --> 52:50.200
I've got my remote hands if I need them.

52:50.200 --> 52:52.360
Uh-oh, that doesn't seem good.

52:52.360 --> 52:54.760
What's it showing on screen?

52:54.760 --> 52:57.520
So what it says is that the monitors for new snapshots

52:57.520 --> 52:58.080
has failed.

52:58.080 --> 53:00.240
It's a snapper dependency service.

53:00.240 --> 53:01.400
But I think it is booting.

53:01.400 --> 53:02.760
Yeah, so let's start it up.

53:02.760 --> 53:04.400
Most likely what's happened is that it

53:04.400 --> 53:06.160
failed to create a snapshot.

53:06.160 --> 53:06.920
Yeah.

53:06.920 --> 53:07.800
All right, good.

53:07.800 --> 53:09.040
Go, Biggie.

53:09.040 --> 53:12.800
Just in time for this server to fall apart.

53:12.800 --> 53:15.000
Right, just time for the snapshot to quit working.

53:15.000 --> 53:18.160
Oh, I'm getting pings.

53:18.160 --> 53:20.600
So is it accepting connections yet?

53:20.600 --> 53:21.440
Yes, it is.

53:21.440 --> 53:22.520
It is, I'm in.

53:22.520 --> 53:25.040
I'm just about to do a Docker PS here

53:25.040 --> 53:26.720
and see what we got going for us.

53:26.720 --> 53:28.120
I'm about to do a mount.

53:28.120 --> 53:30.840
Oh, yeah, I see a lot of ZFS stuff mounted.

53:30.840 --> 53:31.400
Yes.

53:31.400 --> 53:32.400
Sweet, Wes.

53:32.400 --> 53:33.920
You know what I think that is, then?

53:33.920 --> 53:40.760
Good job, Wes.

53:40.760 --> 53:42.760
All our containers up and going.

53:42.760 --> 54:11.320
Hello, little friends.
