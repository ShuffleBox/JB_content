1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I don't know if we've talked about our clone before, Wes.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,920
Maybe we have.

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,760
But I've been thinking about our clone again

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,840
in the context of getting my stuff out of Google Photos.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,720
And I decided to give it a go.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,840
And it has this nice, I guess you could call it a wizard.

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,800
It's a text-based thing that runs you

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,440
through connecting to the various services,

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,240
in this case, Google Photos.

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,600
And then it does this little, I don't know

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,180
if you'd call it a hack, but it does this little trick

12
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,120
where it runs a local web server.

13
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,920
It spins one up just to collect the Google authorization token

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,000
that gets returned from Google.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And then it immediately shuts down the web server,

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,400
configures your permissions,

17
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,840
and then you can just go in there

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,780
and start copying down your Google Photos.

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,920
It'll even do specific albums

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,760
or things like that if you want.

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,900
But I learned it's not exactly perfect.

22
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,360
No, no, it's not.

23
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,200
I mean, our clone is great.

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,880
The issue is more on Google's side.

25
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,200
So issue number one is right now,

26
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,200
downloads strips the exif location.

27
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,400
This is a known limitation of the API

28
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,960
and there's an open bug about it,

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,440
but who knows when that will get fixed.

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,560
That's kind of a bummer.

31
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,600
It sure is.

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,520
But number two might be even worse

33
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,920
because right now the API, which our clone uses,

34
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,640
does not allow photos to be downloaded

35
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,020
at their original resolution.

36
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,200
So they might still be useful.

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,360
You could still process them and post them on Instagram

38
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,320
or whatever you're trying to do.

39
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,760
But if you're trying to use this

40
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,440
as a way to have Google Photos be your backup

41
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,000
and then make a second copy of your backups,

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
that might not work.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,100
And you might instead need to use something

44
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,120
like Google Takeout.

45
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,580
It's almost as if the best solution might be

46
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,760
just don't use Google Photos.

47
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:55,600
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

48
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
My name is Chris.

49
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
My name is Wes.

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Hello Wes.

51
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
It's good to be back from the Montana trip.

52
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600

Coming up on the show today, are you, like me and Wes,

58
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,120
having a hard time kicking the Google Photos habit?

59
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,480
Maybe you're looking for a self-hostable alternative.

60
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,400
They did just recently make a few changes

61
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,320
to the Google Photos deal.

62
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,200
And let's be honest, there is that whole privacy thing

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
to consider.

64
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,440
So coming up on the show this week,

65
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,420
our buddies Brent, a professional photographer,

66
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,880
and Alex, my co-host on the Self-Hosted podcast,

67
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,660
and a home lab master, really, discuss new and old ways

68
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,160
to manage, organize, index, and search your photo collection,

69
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,720
sort of Google Photo style.

70
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,280
And if that wasn't enough, I spent the weekend,

71
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,560
a long weekend, started on Thursday,

72
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,400
with something special.

73
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,600
The new System76 Launch Keyboard.

74
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,200
They're built in Denver, created from scratch,

75
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,520
right there in Colorado, keyboard.

76
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,680
I rushed back from Montana to receive this package,

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,660
and I'm going to share my thoughts on the keyboard

78
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,680
that I say redefines what customizable even means.

79
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,600
But first, with the powers vested in me,

80
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,160
I declare a warm, time-appropriate greetings

81
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,280
to our virtual lug.

82
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,160
Hello, mama room.

83
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,660
Hello.

84
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,160
Hello.

85
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,660
Hello.

86
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,160
Hello.

87
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,660
Hello.

88
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,840
What do you think?

89
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,160
Hello, everybody.

90
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,120
Wow.

91
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,720
Wow.

92
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,600
What a group we have today.

93
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,680
25 of you in there, just solid.

94
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,620
And it's nice to be back.

95
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,160
I missed everybody while I was in Montana.

96
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,800
But you know, it was a good family trip.

97
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,280
We had some adversities, and we had some triumphs,

98
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,920
and we got a lot of swimming.

99
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,920
And I got back to this Launch Keyboard from System76.

100
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,440
It's right here.

101
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,800
I have it plugged in over USB-C to my studio computer.

102
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,840
It is now my studio keyboard.

103
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,600
You haven't switched back, I was wondering.

104
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,440
I got it with the royal keycaps, I think it is,

105
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,480
the slightly quieter ones.

106
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,440
And I've swapped out a few of the keys

107
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,600
already, because it's pretty easy to do that.

108
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,920
It comes with a little keycap remover in the box,

109
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,600
and it comes with a couple alternative keys

110
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,840
that you might want to go with right away.

111
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,840
It's got a USB hub on the back, some A and some C.

112
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,400
It works on Linux.

113
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,160
It works on Windows, and it works on Mac OS.

114
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,040
The keyboard is 100% open source.

115
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,720
The hardware design and the software that runs on it

116
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,880
is all open source.

117
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,640
So of course, those right there check a lot of boxes.

118
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,560
For me, I've also recently gotten a little more

119
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,240
into mechanical keyboards, thanks to the bad,

120
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,680
I'd say, the bad influence for my co-host Mike on Koda Radio.

121
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,000
I've gotten a little more into them.

122
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,680
Let's just say it appears in the studio

123
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,640
that keyboards breed something like bunnies.

124
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,560
Or tribbles, in my case.

125
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,240
Yeah.

126
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,280
So I got it out of the box, and it immediately

127
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,920
had a very solid feel to it.

128
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,000
It looks deceivingly simple, but when you pick it up,

129
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,760
there's a lot of heft in a way that feels like quality.

130
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,080
The Royal keys are not quite as quiet as I expected.

131
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,560
That was my first impression when I started typing.

132
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,680
So maybe I should have just gone with the jades.

133
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,240
And it's set, by default, to a rotating space backlight theme,

134
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,800
which I like.

135
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,440
It circles through different colors

136
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,960
that you maybe would call, like, galaxy colors, I guess.

137
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,800
So I just kept it the default. But job one for me,

138
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,000
when I got this thing, was rearrange the Control, Alt,

139
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,200
and Super, and Function key layout.

140
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,200
By default, System76 ships it with Control key, Alt, Fn, Super.

141
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,440
And that's fine, but not how I like it, you know?

142
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,280
I like it more traditional.

143
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,120
So I quickly just swapped it to Control, Fn, Super, Alt,

144
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,200
swapped the keycaps, and then I went and grabbed their software

145
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,240
to configure the keyboard.

146
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,880
And I was curious what this experience was going to be like,

147
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
because I'm not on Pop!

148
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,640
OS, and I'm on Fedora, which is not even a Debian-based device.

149
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,760
Which is not even a Debian-based distro.

150
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,240
And so I'm like, am I going to be able to grab this, or what?

151
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,160
So I go over to their page, download it off their GitHub,

152
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,880
and it's an app image.

153
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,800
So you mark that sucker executable,

154
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,200
and you double-click on it.

155
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,080
It asks for your root password, because it's

156
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,120
going to scan your bus.

157
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,080
And then it comes up, and it gives you

158
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,800
a really clever layout.

159
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,680
It's a visualization of the keyboard, which works really

160
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,640
well for how my brain works.

161
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,120
And it makes it simple to click this, or hold this,

162
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,160
and map this function.

163
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,400
And within a couple of minutes, I

164
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,600
was mapping multiple keys to a single key press.

165
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,320
And I like that a lot.

166
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,320
Additionally, this thing supports four layers

167
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,320
of customizable keys.

168
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,960
In other words, you can essentially

169
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,720
have four different layouts in this one keyboard,

170
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,000
and you can toggle through them with different key combinations.

171
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,040
I have my right Fn key set to switch to layer two,

172
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,840
which is the default. But one of the things I've done in layer

173
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,680
two is where I have some of my combos.

174
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,480
I've set a different backlighting scheme

175
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,920
for layer two.

176
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,760
And you can do this with each layer.

177
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,280
You can do options like only light up

178
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,600
the keys that have a function assigned to them.

179
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,840
So when I hold down layer two, only half a dozen keys

180
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,440
light up.

181
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,680
And those are just the ones I've mapped something to.

182
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,840
And the rest all stay off.

183
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,040
Layer three switches to a vertical scan pattern

184
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,400
of LED lights.

185
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,480
So I know I'm on layer three, because the keyboard lights

186
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,520
switch pattern.

187
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,320
And then when I release, it goes back to the layer one

188
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,680
pattern of lights.

189
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,560
That simple little thing was the trick

190
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,080
I needed to keep all of this straight.

191
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,680
I was worried that I would get lost

192
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,720
in a sea of customization with this thing.

193
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,040
And I would not be able to map in my brain what's

194
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,920
on what layer, et cetera.

195
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,560
But being able to control the LED lights and colors

196
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,000
and patterns, or just do the single lightups for ones

197
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,600
that have function, gave me the visual trick

198
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,640
I needed combined with their software configurator

199
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,720
that gives you a visual on-screen layout of what

200
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,440
you're doing with a representation of the keyboard

201
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,720
up on screen.

202
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,000
It really actually clicked.

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,680
And I've been able to keep with it.

204
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,520
So the software really gives you a sense of how far you can

205
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,680
actually take this keyboard.

206
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,320
I mean, you can read the specs on their website.

207
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,160
But when you plug it in and then you open up the software,

208
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,880
it redefines what customizable is.

209
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,200
This thing is truly next level.

210
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,040
And then the beautiful thing is everything

211
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,920
is then saved back to the keyboard immediately.

212
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,240
So as soon as I change it, it's applied to the keyboard.

213
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,760
I can unplug it from this computer.

214
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,840
And I can go plug it into an entirely separate machine,

215
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,040
a different operating system.

216
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,000
It doesn't have any of the firmware or any keyboard

217
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,280
software on it.

218
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,000
And it will still all work because it's

219
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,280
saved locally on the keyboard.

220
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,880
That is huge for me because I don't

221
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,280
want to have to load the software on every single machine

222
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,040
that I want to use this thing on.

223
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,960
And it also is showed right up in the GNOME firmware

224
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,920
tool that uses LVFS.

225
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,560
So it's completely supported by LVFS for updates.

226
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,680
And I like seeing that.

227
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,400
And somehow, you haven't even mentioned

228
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,400
that their customization tool is powered by Rust.

229
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:52,920
Oh, I'm sorry.

230
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,800
What was that, Wes?

231
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,840
It was powered by Rust.

232
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,360
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

233
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,200
And I wasn't really 100% sure, despite all of that,

234
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,440
if it was really worth $285 because that seems

235
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,160
like a lot of money for a keyboard.

236
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,020
So what I did is I went to Amazon

237
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,480
and I looked at some of their best, highest rated

238
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,160
mechanical keyboards.

239
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,200
And I went for the cheapest mechanical keyboard

240
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,800
I could find.

241
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,240
And I found one for $35.

242
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,000
So I thought, let's see how this $35 keyboard stacks up

243
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,640
against the $285 System76 keyboard.

244
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,120
And there's obvious things, like this one sort of

245
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,320
has a more muted sound.

246
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,000
It doesn't quite feel quite as good.

247
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,460
I mean, that's not a huge surprise.

248
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,200
It's also plasticky and light.

249
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,480
In fact, it even flexes a little bit when I twist it,

250
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,920
where I could win a knife fight with the launch as a weapon.

251
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,000
It's very solid.

252
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,680
And those things were kind of like, OK,

253
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,880
I went into a $30 keyboard expecting that.

254
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,100
That's not really where I'm going to judge this on.

255
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,520
I put them down side by side.

256
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,040
And Wes was here on Sunday and we

257
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,760
were doing Linux action news.

258
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,800
And I didn't even prompt Wes.

259
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,040
I didn't say anything to Wes.

260
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,800
You brought it up to me.

261
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,480
You said, you're typing faster than I've ever seen you type

262
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,360
on the launch.

263
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,520
That I did.

264
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,840
I mean, you seemed kind of naturally at home.

265
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,540
Admittedly, you had a different mechanical keyboard

266
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,560
currently in use at the studio for a while, which didn't

267
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,840
seem to be jiving with you.

268
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,840
But it was clear that this was a new keyboard

269
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,040
you were going to keep using.

270
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,640
Yeah, so that other keyboard we tried

271
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,640
that I hadn't here for a while was the Keytron K3.

272
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,960
And I really wanted to like it because it was a good size.

273
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,880
That was one that Keytron's a little bit smaller

274
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,360
than the $35 Amazon one.

275
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,080
The $35 Amazon one's a little wider.

276
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,280
But the Keytron and the launch are about the same desk size.

277
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,680
They're about the same size.

278
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,140
And I can type significantly faster on the launch.

279
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,320
And I think it is the layout a bit.

280
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,020
It is also the way the keys feel.

281
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,480
I think all of those, I think it's like three or four things

282
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,920
about the design of the keyboard that come together

283
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,960
to make it actually really fast.

284
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,160
But I noticed it too.

285
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,440
Even though I hadn't said anything to you about it,

286
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,240
that weekend, I used the keyboard

287
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,960
to write all of the notes for Linux Action News.

288
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,760
And I was flying.

289
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,760
I was like really enjoying the typing experience.

290
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,560
And I know that sounds kind of cliche.

291
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,880
But that matters a lot to me because I'm

292
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,120
touching this damn thing every day, all damn day.

293
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,000
And it matters to me that I smile when I look down at it.

294
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
And it matters to me that it feels good

295
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,160
every time I press on it.

296
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,920
That's what you're paying for, right?

297
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,040
If it works and with the durability

298
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,280
that it looks like this thing has,

299
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,240
it could be your keyboard for the next decade.

300
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,280
There's absolutely no question about it.

301
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,320
It's USB-C with its customizability.

302
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,440
I will use this keyboard forever.

303
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,960
It's going to last a very long time.

304
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,840
And keyboards do for me in general.

305
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,680
If it was $185 or $200, I would have already

306
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,960
ordered another one.

307
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,200
I absolutely would.

308
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,360
At $285, it's kind of a special treat.

309
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,440
And so it's going to be what we use in the studio.

310
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,160
That feels kind of appropriate because it's

311
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,680
kind of a specialty item.

312
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,480
And then that plays a role for me too, right?

313
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,920
This feels a bit like a bespoke item.

314
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,240
It feels like something that my friends hand-built in Denver,

315
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,800
you know, like people that are part of my community

316
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,000
hand-built something.

317
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,560
And I can buy it from them.

318
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,160
And that's special too.

319
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,720
And that's also the reason why I bought the Librem 15,

320
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,400
because it also had that unique kind of collector

321
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,000
almost feel to it.

322
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,400
And that's why I bought the Atari VCS as well,

323
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,000
even though I haven't received that one.

324
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,120
Because again, it's kind of a unique item

325
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,320
that comes from somebody that is working in the Linux community.

326
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,120
And this launch encompasses that even so much more.

327
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,720
I mean, they've been around now for well over 10 years now.

328
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,520
But this represents a new milestone

329
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,600
and a first for their business and a first for a Linux vendor.

330
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,480
And so I wanted to have it for that reason too.

331
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,560
And I mention that because those thoughts are invoked

332
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,760
every time I look down at it.

333
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,960
And that makes me happy as well.

334
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,120
And so for me, it is worth the $285.

335
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,640
And the $35 keyboard and the Keytron, which is $85,

336
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,840
are all good keyboards.

337
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,240
But they have things that are frustrating about them,

338
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,680
where the launch really doesn't have any compromises.

339
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,880
I didn't want a numpad.

340
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,640
I know for some people that is an issue.

341
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,240
But for me, this keyboard doesn't really

342
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,720
have the compromises that those other two have.

343
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,360
And a lot of times, when you get to the higher end gear,

344
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,560
and Wes and I talked about this over the weekend, when

345
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,120
it comes to our microphones, you start

346
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,000
to get to the $500, $600, $1,000 microphones,

347
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,920
they don't sound $500 better than a $200 microphone.

348
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,200
They don't sound $1,000 better than a $100 microphone.

349
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,680
They sound $50, $80 better, to be realistic about it.

350
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,480
The drop off is kind of dramatic when

351
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,720
it comes into high end professional audio gear.

352
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,840
Some of that is true when it comes to high end computer

353
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,320
gear.

354
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,640
I don't think that drop off is as dramatic here

355
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,640
with the keyboard.

356
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,920
But when I look at this $85 Keytron,

357
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,040
this launches another $200.

358
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,880
Is it $200 better?

359
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,800
I can't say.

360
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,480
But I can say it is much better.

361
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,280
I don't know if it's $200, but that's just

362
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,680
going to be a personal value call each person makes.

363
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,240
I, however, am very happy with it.

364
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,600
And we'll spend a very long time using the keyboard.

365
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,720
And I think in four or five years,

366
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,120
I'm not even going to be thinking about the $285 price.

367
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,160
I'm just going to be thinking about how

368
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,680
great this keyboard still is.

369
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,040
And I imagine it will remain my favorite keyboard

370
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,240
for a long time until I get another one.

371
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,280
There's also the aspect here that because it's open source,

372
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,000
all of the openness about it, you

373
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,560
can be a little less worried that support's going to drop

374
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,940
or somehow System76, god forbid, goes out of business

375
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,560
and you can no longer update or there's

376
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,800
no more updates to their configuration utility

377
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,880
or they somehow don't host the proprietary EXE download

378
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,840
anymore.

379
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,400
Seems like you can put your faith that A, this thing's

380
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,240
going to be around as long as you need it,

381
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,240
and B, I mean, you're helping System76 out

382
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,400
by giving them some cash.

383
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,280
And maybe there'll be some future keyboards

384
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,360
that are even nicer.

385
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,480
I talked to my buddy Mike in Coder Radio

386
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
this week about his experiences using it.

387
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,760
He tested it on a Mac, and it works there, too.

388
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,520
Spoiler alert.

389
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,360
So that's pretty impressive, the fact

390
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,720
that I got it working on a Neon install and a Fedora box,

391
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,600
and he has it working on a Mac.

392
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,400
And it seems to be fully functional there as well.

393
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,940
And it's really easy to swap the keys around to your liking

394
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,280
and then just go map them in the software.

395
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,940
And they're making the software available

396
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,560
for Windows and the Mac, too.

397
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,000
And all these things just kind of come together

398
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,040
to make it feel like it's a bit of a new milestone

399
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
for System76.

400
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,540
I mean, think about what they had to do to build this thing

401
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,800
and actually ship it to customers

402
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,040
from just like a project management

403
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,640
standpoint and a process development

404
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,280
standpoint for a business, right?

405
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,000
And then you think about where this leads.

406
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,520
Now that they've, this is their first shot.

407
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,920
And I'm sitting here telling you, I really like it.

408
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,220
It could have been junk.

409
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,240
It could have been crappy to type on.

410
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,560
It's not like they've built a lot of keyboards before.

411
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,120
So if they took something like this

412
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,080
and they put this something like this in a laptop,

413
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,660
that was like something they moved on to,

414
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,260
is building a laptop that just runs Linux

415
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,080
and has a keyboard like this on it,

416
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,160
I think that'd be an extremely compelling project.

417
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,600
And this is obviously the first step on a much longer journey.

418
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,840
And checking in on goalpost one, they nailed it.

419
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,840
And I think that's really the takeaway here, is wherever

420
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,720
they end up taking this, if this is step one,

421
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,080
well, they nailed step one.

422
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,400
So the way I look at this, when you first

423
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,160
mentioned this keyboard, I had a similar reaction of how much?

424
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,400
This is way too much.

425
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,960
There's no way anybody's going to spend $285 on a keyboard.

426
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,480
But then I started thinking about the equivalent

427
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,920
in different industries.

428
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,460
Cars is a perfect example.

429
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,720
I have a premium version of a Golf

430
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,600
sat on my driveway, a very average economy car that's

431
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,160
had a bigger engine and whatever put into it.

432
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,880
I don't need that bigger engine.

433
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,120
I don't need the four-wheel drive system.

434
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,600
But yet, I'm happy to pay extra because it gives me

435
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,120
those feels when I get into it.

436
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,960
I look down and I see the fact that it

437
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,880
has the flappy paddles on the steering wheel.

438
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,840
And I think to myself, yeah, this is nice.

439
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,800
This makes me feel good.

440
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,840
And if you're getting that same feeling from the keyboard,

441
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:17,560
something that you touch and see all day, every day for half

442
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,120
a decade, maybe longer, sure, I think it's worth it, don't you?

443
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,560
That is my math on it.

444
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,080
I know for some, though, I think maybe for Neil,

445
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,280
if it's not full-sized, it doesn't really work for you,

446
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:27,800
does it?

447
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,520
Yeah, I actually use my number pad quite a lot.

448
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,520
And I mean, I can obviously get away with it

449
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,680
without having it because my laptops don't have it.

450
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,880
I actually hate having the number pad on the laptops

451
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,320
because it makes them cramped.

452
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,760
But when I'm working on a desktop

453
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,640
and I'm going to have an external keyboard,

454
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,360
I really want a full-sized one because I take advantage

455
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,120
of the real estate.

456
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,760
And I like the more space in the keys

457
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,320
and a lot more even layout.

458
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,720
That said, I'm super excited about this.

459
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,400
And if they had a regular version of it with a full layout

460
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,000
and even maybe some multimedia keys

461
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,840
and some extra little quality of life additions,

462
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,040
I'd be down for it.

463
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,200
Maybe they will have multiple.

464
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,880
I've wondered.

465
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,720
Or like a volume knob that some of those fancy keyboards have.

466
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,560
I'd take that.

467
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,040
Yeah.

468
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
I love the volume.

469
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,080
I do, too.

470
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,200
It's my volume knob.

471
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,440
And so legit, I use my media keys a lot.

472
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,000
I have the volume control, the play, pause, back, forward,

473
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
and the mute button.

474
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,520
The mute button gets hit a lot.

475
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,440
I use those.

476
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,440
And so having those on a keyboard is important for me.

477
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,160
Right.

478
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,400
I am very, very, very fond of compact keyboards

479
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,080
here in the studio and in my recording setup

480
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,240
in my mobile setup in Lady Jupiter.

481
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,480
But at my desk, I agree with you there.

482
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,840
I like a full-sized keyboard.

483
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
And I think maybe that's one of the reasons I'm not

484
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,160
putting the launch at my office desk.

485
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,400
I'm putting it here in the studio.

486
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,480
And then also because it's a bit of a conversation

487
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,160
piece in the studio as well.

488
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,760
But yeah, that's very true.

489
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,320
And I would love to see one day multiple versions

490
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,440
of the launch.

491
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,480
That could be pretty cool.

492
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,240
What would you have on your keyboard, Wes,

493
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,920
on your custom launch keyboard?

494
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,440
Oh, yeah.

495
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:05,920
OK.

496
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,280
Well, I definitely want the volume knob and then

497
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,720
as many possible LEDs as they could pack.

498
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,880
And Pipe Dream here, what about something like a System76

499
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,520
Pure Open Source Powered Touch Bar?

500
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,680
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

501
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,040
Well, first, in the housekeeping,

502
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,840
I wanted to let you know that our buddies across the pond

503
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,840
have a bit of a party this Saturday.

504
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,880
Foss Talk Live starts at 7 PM their local time

505
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,040
on their YouTube channel.

506
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,720
You can go over there and get subscribed,

507
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,000
and then that will just go live.

508
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
So we are recording this on June 8.

509
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,520
So it is the Saturday we're recording,

510
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,480
which is June 12, 2021, Foss Talk Live,

511
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,040
7 PM their local time.

512
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,720
And it's a crossover event, too.

513
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,920
So Wes and I will have it up.

514
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,280
We'll have the popcorn going, and we'll

515
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,040
be cracking jokes at our friends' expense.

516
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,280
It should be a good time.

517
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,920
Oh, you know it.

518
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,280
Also, we'd love to hear from you.

519
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,680
Some ideas that we have on this show, some of the segments,

520
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,480
like today's episode, are inspired by our audience.

521
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,000
We get emails into the show, and then we pursue an answer.

522
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,440
So we'd love to get your questions, your feedback, all

523
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,640
of it, at linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

524
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,140
Of course, there is a whole network,

525
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,280
and the conversation is always rolling in our Telegram channel.

526
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,400
You can join that at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash

527
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,440
Telegram, and the conversation goes 24-7,

528
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,160
and many of us are popping in and out there

529
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:26,880
throughout the day.

530
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,120
Linode.com slash unplugged.

531
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,240
Go there to get $100 in credit for 60 days on your new account.

532
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,640
And of course, you support the show,

533
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,760
make it possible for us to release free content.

534
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,360
Linode is our hosting provider of choice.

535
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,280
You guys know that.

536
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,980
But I was reflecting on one of the things

537
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,360
that I really appreciate about Linode while I was traveling.

538
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,920
And as you can probably guess, that

539
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,340
was making it possible for us to keep services up,

540
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,080
even though I was mostly AFK.

541
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,520
So I'm traveling, and of course, as you would expect,

542
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,560
I get an alert.

543
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,920
That alert tells me that network traffic has gone crazy

544
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,040
on one of our boxes.

545
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,400
But the great thing about Linode,

546
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,440
and honestly, yeah, I could do this myself.

547
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,200
In fact, some of our Linodes, we do have our own software

548
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,120
and alerting on there.

549
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,080
And yeah, I can set up monitoring and alerting.

550
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,920
But it's table stakes with Linode.

551
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,000
That's the great thing, is there's a baseline.

552
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,600
And getting alerts on things like excessive network traffic

553
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,440
is almost always a tell that something is wrong on a box.

554
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,440
I mean, maybe you're just having a great day.

555
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,240
You know, that's good to know too, actually.

556
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,240
That's kind of like, yeah, hell yeah, we're doing great.

557
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,600
But no, not in this case.

558
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,160
But the thing that is really slick

559
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,560
is it's easy to work with a team.

560
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,560
And so Wes got the alert and was able to get logged in and fix

561
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,320
the issue before I even read the email.

562
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,960
He gave me a status update.

563
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,240
And I just sat there thinking to myself, man,

564
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,520
am I really grateful that these kinds of basics

565
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,520
are taken care of and that I pop into the dashboard,

566
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,360
I can see the history, I can see what's going on.

567
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,800
And even if you're not a pro, the cloud dashboard

568
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,560
Linode has built is so straightforward

569
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,880
that you're going to get access to this information right away.

570
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,760
And they kind of just abstract away

571
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,520
the fact that you get 11 data centers to choose from that

572
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,000
have crazy fast connections between them

573
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,240
and that you have everything from these $5 a month

574
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,520
rigs, which it's amazing how many things you

575
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,960
can run on one of those, to systems with AMD

576
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,280
epic processors that just crush all of the competition,

577
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,760
like the full range is in there, while still being 30% to 50%

578
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,280
cheaper than big cloud that has these complicated, horrible

579
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,080
UIs, often with some sort of funky secondary business

580
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,200
model behind them, where Linode, they're truly independent.

581
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,400
In fact, they are the largest independent cloud provider.

582
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,520
And I love that about them.

583
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,200
They've been around since 2003.

584
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,640
The Linode infrastructure is solid.

585
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,560
You can focus on your project and not

586
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,840
having to build and manage all of that stuff.

587
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,200
And you get alerts when something goes sideways, too.

588
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
And that's pretty great.

589
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,640
So head over to linode.com slash unplug.

590
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,480
Get that $100 credit for your new account

591
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,680
and try this stuff out.

592
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,600
Go build something, learn something, maybe deliver

593
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
something online.

594
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,160
There's a lot of ways to host things.

595
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,840
There's a lot of companies that offer

596
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,440
a lot of different options at crazy different price points.

597
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,000
But none of them, none of them are Linode.

598
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,520
None of them bring it all together.

599
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,000
None of them are the largest independent cloud provider.

600
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,280
And none of them have been involved in the Linux community

601
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,280
as long as Linode, because they've been doing it

602
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,400
before everybody else.

603
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,160
So go get $100 and support the show.

604
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,760
Linode.com slash unplugged.

605
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:32,000
Dries from Belgium wrote in, I'm a long-term Mac user

606
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,880
dipping my toes in Linux with a second-hand ThinkPad running

607
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,000
Pop OS, that sounds like a nice setup.

608
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,120
I also have an iPhone and a Canon M50.

609
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,720
I'm wondering what photo managing solution

610
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,440
do you all recommend?

611
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,160
I think privacy is very important.

612
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,440
I want to add right here.

613
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,960
And I'd also like a local copy, as well as, ideally,

614
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,640
a cloud backup.

615
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,400
I've also got a Raspberry Pi laying around,

616
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,880
which I could use if I was going to self-host something.

617
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,320
What are your photo managing and backup workflows?

618
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,120
Local, cloud, both?

619
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,240
Uh-oh, I have to admit something on the episode now.

620
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,720
Right here, I got to say, I have slipped back

621
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,320
into using Google Photos as my backup backup.

622
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,800
You kind of have that second backup.

623
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,240
And truthfully, I have found part of the reason

624
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,280
that I've been drawn back to it is the front-end client

625
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,440
features of being able to search for objects like dog

626
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,480
and Christmas tree or pictures of my son in Idaho

627
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,640
has just drawn me back to using Google Photos,

628
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,320
because the front-end makes it easy to find photos

629
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,040
that I can then pull and send to a family member really quick.

630
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,920
And that practical functionality brought me back.

631
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,600
And so I use, on my phone, the Google Photo backup app

632
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,080
to send my photos off site.

633
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,880
Yeah, I have to admit, I'm in the same boat.

634
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,560
I used to have a sort of custom sync thing solution going,

635
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,320
which worked pretty well.

636
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,280
But honestly, the network effect kind of pulled me back

637
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,120
into Google Photos.

638
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,720
I mean, one, I had bought a Pixel,

639
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,320
and so it was kind of opted in anyway.

640
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,680
And then I went on some vacations.

641
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,720
This was a few years ago.

642
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,760
But my friends, they were on there too.

643
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,600
They were starting an album.

644
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,360
I had to upload some things to Google Photos regardless.

645
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,520
And once I was there, it was just so easy to stay.

646
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,720
That's the trick.

647
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,120
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

648
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,960
So the problem actually is, we're

649
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,720
going to admit, Google Photos is a good product.

650
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,120
But recently, Google has made change to the pricing structure

651
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,080
and taken away some of the incentives that they

652
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,760
used to actually get us using it in the first place.

653
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,840
And with any kind of Google thing,

654
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,560
it's kind of like, how long is this going to be around?

655
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,080
Is this really a long-term solution?

656
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,760
And what about the privacy aspects of it

657
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,400
and the ongoing cost?

658
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,040
And I don't know, do you agree, Alex?

659
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,720
Is part of the problem Google Photos is just kind of, well,

660
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,880
it's damn good.

661
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,800
I do, absolutely.

662
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,080
Yes, hello, everybody.

663
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,760
They've done the old bait and switch there, haven't they?

664
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,280
The first hit is free.

665
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,120
Exactly.

666
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,080
They drew me in.

667
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,520
And then because I was already paying for Google Storage

668
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,720
for my backups, it wasn't like this, oh no, now I have to pay.

669
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,200
It was like, oh, well, I'm already paying,

670
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,840
so I guess I can just keep using it.

671
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,360
Now, for those that aren't familiar,

672
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,520
what's actually changing is that as of June 1, 2021,

673
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,440
the account storage is shared across Drive, Gmail,

674
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,120
and Photos.

675
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,280
But any new photos and videos you upload

676
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,840
will now count towards the free 15 gigabytes of storage that

677
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,560
comes with every Google account.

678
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,880
Now, the reason that's changed is

679
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,960
before they had this kind of compressed high quality

680
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,360
in air quotes that didn't count towards that quota,

681
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,400
but now everything does, no matter what.

682
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,320
Yeah.

683
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,760
And I wasn't using all 10 terabytes,

684
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,520
so it wasn't a huge hit to me.

685
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,000
But it woke me up and reminded me

686
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,560
how precarious the situation is when I'm using a hosted service

687
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,120
like this, and how they always, so far, Alex,

688
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,720
have inevitably bit me in the butt,

689
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,320
and a lot of times have done so in such a way that

690
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,160
inspired us to start the self-hosted podcast.

691
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,600
So that, I know, is well-covered ground for us.

692
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,440
But yet, here I am, knowing better,

693
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,480
knowing the privacy implications of Google, all of that.

694
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,320
The transparent background uploads,

695
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,400
the sharing features that Wes touched on,

696
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,680
and then the searching features are very good.

697
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,160
And you could make the argument that now that Google

698
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,400
is making you pay for this, it actually

699
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,040
makes Google Photos sustainable.

700
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,800
So it'll be around for a long time.

701
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,200
So I think it remains a very viable option.

702
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,800
But I know I should be probably looking into other things.

703
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,920
Well, when we look at the whole picture here,

704
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,440
you've got to take into consideration who owns the data,

705
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,640
what are they going to do with it, how much is it

706
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,400
going to cost, not just in terms of it's

707
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,200
going to cost me a couple of dollars every month,

708
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,880
but in terms of the cost to humanity,

709
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,680
I suppose, in not having a fully open solution.

710
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,480
And what I've come to find writing this piece

711
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,120
is that there isn't one size fits

712
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,680
all self-hosted photo management solution.

713
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,440
There are several very good options,

714
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,440
but all of them check different boxes

715
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,960
and miss other really basic stuff.

716
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,520
Libre Photos, for example, is one of the apps

717
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,440
we'll come on to later.

718
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,400
It doesn't let you delete a photo from an album.

719
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,320
It just boggles my mind that such a basic thing

720
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,720
gets missed from some of this stuff.

721
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,280
But the other angle of self-hosting

722
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,800
is that you have to have a server.

723
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,280
You have to pay either Linode, or build one

724
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,200
and stick it in your basement, or a closet, or whatever it is.

725
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,800
And so there's a cost not only in terms of financial stuff

726
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,320
upfront for self-hosting, but also in terms of my time

727
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,200
to research and set these things up as well.

728
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,640
And if Google Photos ends up being around for 10, 15 years,

729
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,840
is it likely that you're going to build and self-host

730
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,080
something that will also be around for 10 or 15 years?

731
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,320
That's what I was thinking.

732
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,080
I'm OK running some of my infrastructure,

733
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,680
but photos are some things I'd like to not lose.

734
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,240
And if I make a mistake, as a novice admin, say.

735
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,560
I always find it useful, whenever

736
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,320
we talk in such large timescales,

737
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,040
to just remind you, 10 years ago was 2011.

738
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,320
What were you doing then with your photos?

739
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,120
Just picture how far the industry's come in that decade

740
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,840
and think about how far it might go in the next.

741
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,400
It seems like what really is the killer next generation

742
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:18,560
feature is object recognition, face recognition, location

743
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,720
recognition, and then an interface that

744
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,760
allows you to manage all of that.

745
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,000
And that's what Google nailed early with Google Photos.

746
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,480
It isn't necessarily impossible to get in something

747
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,880
you could run yourself.

748
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,240
And I know you've looked at several of them.

749
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,200
Well, if I was reviewing Google Photos,

750
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,400
one of the things I would probably put in the negative

751
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,440
column is that it doesn't have an awful lot in the way

752
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,000
of organizational features.

753
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,760
It has basic album support, and that's pretty much it.

754
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,560
Compare that to a lot of the other options

755
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,360
that we'll talk about today.

756
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,720
And Google managed to sidestep a lot of that

757
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,400
by having awesome machine learning.

758
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,800
And when you have an interface that is literally,

759
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,880
like you said in the beginning, search

760
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,360
for photos of Dylan in Idaho, you

761
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,240
don't need a directory structure that organizes everything.

762
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,640
You don't need to spend hours tagging things.

763
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,720
Their algorithms have done all that work for you.

764
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,160
And machine learning, it's a bit of a buzzword in the industry,

765
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,360
but if we think about it in its simplest form,

766
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,800
it's just pattern matching.

767
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,680
So all the algorithms are looking

768
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,520
for are certain groupings of pixels

769
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,520
that it think, well, maybe that's a tree.

770
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,400
Maybe that's a face.

771
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,480
Maybe that's a monkey.

772
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,360
Or a hot dog.

773
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,360
Or a hot dog, yes.

774
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,240
Have you seen that Silicon Valley episode?

775
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,120
And machine learning really is everywhere these days.

776
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,800
And I was watching, I think it was a Marques Brownlee video,

777
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,600
MKBHD on YouTube, talking about how farmers

778
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:51,080
are using machine learning to identify weeds in their crops

779
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,560
so that they use 90% less pesticides.

780
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,280
So interesting.

781
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,600
There are some significant use cases for machine learning

782
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,240
outside of photos.

783
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,920
But of course, where it gets interesting is it reduces

784
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,440
your overhead of organization.

785
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,920
Right, because you don't have to go through and tag,

786
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,960
this is a Dylan picture.

787
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,040
This is a Chris picture.

788
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,520
This is an Idaho picture.

789
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,080
It just does all that for you and then

790
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,960
makes it available as search criteria.

791
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,040
Absolutely.

792
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,680
Now, when we're thinking about this space,

793
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,800
we've got to think about the workflow.

794
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,920
And I think we've got Brent on the line as well.

795
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,080
And as a professional photographer,

796
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,480
I'm sure he can add something into the conversation

797
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,840
about workflows.

798
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,800
But what I'm primarily looking to back up here

799
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,760
are the images I take on my smartphone.

800
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,640
I do take a lot of images with my SLR when I'm traveling.

801
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,800
But for most of the rest of the time,

802
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,280
I will dump those at the end of a trip.

803
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,280
And it's two weeks worth of images, bang.

804
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,920
And I'm done.

805
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,840
What I'm more interested in is that kind of daily minutia

806
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,120
kind of automation and getting those images

807
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,920
off my mobile device in a never compressed format.

808
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,280
Now, I use Nextcloud to do this.

809
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,240
What do you use?

810
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,600
Actually, Alex, I'm using Nextcloud as well.

811
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,400
And in the beginning, it was a little clumsy.

812
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,200
But these days, I'm finding it just very seamless.

813
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,560
Is that your experience as well?

814
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,280
It just works.

815
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,080
Yeah, and that's the best kind of works.

816
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,920
Does it run automatically in the background?

817
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,440
Yeah, it has this nice feature where

818
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,800
it's just called auto upload.

819
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,480
And you can add any folder that detects media on your phone.

820
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,680
So it could be even just like downloads and things like that,

821
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,760
not just the photos from your camera, which

822
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,320
I found really helpful to back up things like backups

823
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,880
of my signal database that happens automatically,

824
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,640
things like that.

825
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,120
Oh, that's a good idea.

826
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,240
There you go.

827
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,880
But for photographs, it's great.

828
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,980
Because as a professional photographer,

829
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,720
I have this sort of constant fear

830
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,200
of losing any photographs that's been baked into my mind

831
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,960
for a really long time.

832
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,480
And so I call it the sort of run over by a dump truck situation.

833
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,560
If your phone gets run over by a dump truck

834
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,120
while you're out on some experience

835
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,800
that you want to remember forever,

836
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,240
well, it uploads your photos as you take them.

837
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,440
And I think that's a really nice feature.

838
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,000
And Nextcloud has been really seamless doing that.

839
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,240
So in terms of at least that auto backup feature,

840
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,760
it's really solid, really, really solid,

841
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,240
not to mention solving a bunch of other neat things for us

842
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
outside of photos.

843
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,600
So there's several ways to get the photos off the phone.

844
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,400
Like Alex and I recently talked about FolderSync,

845
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,320
which is another Android application that does this.

846
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,400
Of course, I guess the obvious other one would be Dropbox.

847
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,440
They offer to do this.

848
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:29,940
Indeed.

849
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:32,640
And they'll get it on a file system for you, right?

850
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,400
So it seems like there are several ways

851
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,600
to solve that with various pluses and minuses.

852
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,720
But that's not really what my problem isn't getting

853
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,000
the photo off the device.

854
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,760
I don't even mind like you, Alex.

855
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,840
I'll sit down after a trip, and I'll dump the photos off

856
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,480
of the SD card for the drone.

857
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,600
I'll manually do that.

858
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,860
There's nothing automated about that.

859
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,400
But there's kind of a ritual about it.

860
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,840
And I'm pretty good about doing that one thing.

861
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,080
That I got down.

862
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,880
It is honestly, it's the organization.

863
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,040
I guess I don't want to say I'm lazy.

864
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,680
Young Chris kept everything in folders on his file system

865
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,160
and managed his music and his pictures that way and loved it.

866
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,440
And it was a system that really worked for him.

867
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,800
But now President Chris looks back at that guy

868
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,480
and goes, boy, what a waste of my time.

869
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,480
I'm not doing that.

870
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,840
But yet, I consider these photos extremely important.

871
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,720
It's this weird dichotomy that I find myself in.

872
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,960
And so it's not so much the uploading of the photos.

873
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,280
It is the managing of the photos.

874
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,160
And I'm trying to find something that

875
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,680
isn't a proprietary system, that isn't locked to Apple or Google.

876
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,960
It's really easy to do that kind of organization

877
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,240
when you have a trip to aim at.

878
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,960
You know, 2015 road trip, Southwest USA, for example.

879
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,520
Or like family reunion 2021.

880
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,120
Uh-huh.

881
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,600
But if it's just a random Tuesday

882
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,680
where you've snapped to your kid being cute,

883
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,640
it's a bit harder to get that into some kind of folder

884
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,240
other than misc, right?

885
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,880
Yeah, or just even spend the time

886
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,280
to do it in the daily flow like that.

887
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,400
And one of those things that slips, right?

888
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,800
Maybe you try to do it on Sundays,

889
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,840
but then something came up and someone came over

890
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,560
and then you missed it.

891
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,120
How important do we think open source

892
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,000
versus closed source is in this space?

893
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,160
Boy, that's tough.

894
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,000
That's tough.

895
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,080
That is tricky because I often consider

896
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,440
the essential applications to be the most important

897
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,200
open source free software applications.

898
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,160
Like that's generally my default.

899
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,440
But I'm worried, to be honest with you, Alex,

900
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,840
that the machine learning stuff

901
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,760
or whatever GPU acceleration stuff

902
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,440
that's going to be necessary to get what I want

903
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,960
is all going to be proprietary.

904
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,200
Well, good news there.

905
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,840
Most of the apps that we'll talk about today

906
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,920
use TensorFlow,

907
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,600
which is a Google machine learning algorithm.

908
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,440
There's another one that we'll talk about

909
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,360
called PhotoStruxure, which has a closed source

910
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,600
and it's also a paid product as well.

911
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,120
But the developer has committed,

912
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,640
if anything happens to him or his company,

913
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,920
to open source the product.

914
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,640
Does that count for you?

915
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,440
It's definitely a plus anyway.

916
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,360
I mean, I'm not,

917
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,200
I guess I can handle proprietary software,

918
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,560
but I'd like to understand some of the motivations

919
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,440
and think that there's something long-term

920
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,120
that I can depend on at the very least.

921
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,560
I mean, there's clear advantages to an open source project

922
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,680
if it has a sizable user base

923
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,760
and a sustainable development model.

924
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,920
You get visibility into the direction of the project

925
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,280
and photos is a pretty important possession.

926
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,840
And so having that kind of forward-looking guidance

927
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,480
on a project gives me peace of mind.

928
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,920
But we talked about Beersmith in episode 400.

929
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,560
That's a proprietary application,

930
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,200
but it is built by a developer

931
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,800
who's dedicating his life to that.

932
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,880
And it's got a good user base and he's not going away.

933
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,520
Or, I mean, we're recording this right now in Reaper,

934
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,040
which is also a proprietary application,

935
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,480
but one that we love and absolutely depend on.

936
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,680
Yeah, so if the tool's clever enough

937
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,920
and it looks sustainable, I'd consider it.

938
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,760
It's the age-old question

939
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,400
of how do you monetize open source?

940
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,240
Right.

941
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,040
I think it's a problem that will bother us

942
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,240
for many years yet.

943
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,320
Well, and Alex, it's also pragmatism versus idealism.

944
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,240
It's that question too.

945
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,440
And you're coming to something

946
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,040
like your precious life photos.

947
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,640
And you're like in this war of like,

948
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,240
well, do I want something that's only free software?

949
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,520
Or am I willing to settle?

950
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,120
And it's like, where do you fall

951
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,360
on that whole pragmatism versus idealism line?

952
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,240
Well, I think if you're going full pragmatist,

953
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,160
you'll just use Google Photos, right?

954
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,760
Yeah, and I think that's what's been gnawing

955
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,240
at both Wes and I is full pragmatist

956
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,640
also means you're fully vulnerable

957
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,080
to whatever that service provider does.

958
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,680
And that's uncomfortable.

959
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,080
We were looking a little bit before the show

960
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,400
and playing around with Google Photos sync

961
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,240
like a Python daemon that'll sync stuff down from Google.

962
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,600
So I wonder if there's maybe some happy mediums there

963
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,080
where you still might want a backup.

964
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,320
Maybe you even want sort of a read-only view

965
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,520
of a local web interface of those backed up files,

966
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,200
but you use Google Photos for sharing with family.

967
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,320
Right, and so you have local copies

968
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,040
and then you have the copies on Google Photos.

969
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,880
Or maybe it goes the other way

970
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,720
and you sync it locally

971
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,760
and then upload them to Google Photos on the site.

972
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,600
I'm not sure.

973
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,680
It seems like there's a lot of options though.

974
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,720
Or maybe something else entirely.

975
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,000
You could argue, right, that Google Photos

976
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,160
being a completely proprietary service is irrelevant

977
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,000
as long as the export tools are good enough.

978
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,440
And Google love to promote this Google Takeout tool.

979
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,920
But when I was writing this piece,

980
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,720
you know, it's taken me a week or so.

981
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,320
On the first night I was writing,

982
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,800
I went to Google Takeout

983
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,520
and pressed the give me my photos button.

984
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,240
We are about eight or nine days now

985
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,800
and I still haven't gotten the download link.

986
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,000
Really? Wow.

987
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,560
That doesn't give you confidence.

988
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,400
Not really.

989
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,240
Although I have to say,

990
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,160
I think if Google Photos was gonna shut down,

991
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,480
they would probably give people a pretty good grace period

992
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,560
to get their data out of there.

993
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,080
I don't think Google will just turn it off.

994
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,480
I think what is actually more likely, Alex,

995
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,600
is that something happens to my Google account

996
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,640
and I lose access to my Google account, thus my photos.

997
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,520
Now I know that Brent,

998
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,920
you have a fully open sourced workflow.

999
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,280
So you must have some opinions on this, right?

1000
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,280
Well, I started tackling this problem

1001
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,480
much before we had mobile phones.

1002
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,480
And so I will say my solutions are a bit archaic,

1003
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,880
but they are solid.

1004
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,680
Stay a while and listen.

1005
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,240
And so one thing, one criteria I had

1006
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,480
that's still very strong for me

1007
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,360
is to always have the ability to put my photos

1008
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,200
somewhere on a file system without dependency on anything.

1009
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,200
So anything includes a company, a web service, a database,

1010
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,000
if I can have access to them always,

1011
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,200
then that's really super important.

1012
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,240
And so Chris, when you said,

1013
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,800
oh, if I lose access to my Google account,

1014
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,600
I started cringing and my palms are sweating

1015
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,760
and that makes me super uncomfortable

1016
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,560
because that's something I've seen happen a lot

1017
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,600
to very well-meaning people.

1018
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,400
And I've tried to help people get in

1019
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
and sometimes it's impossible.

1020
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,120
And so actually that's even worse

1021
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,480
than having your phone run over by a dump truck

1022
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,240
because it's all of the photos spanning across

1023
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,600
several generations of phones that you've had

1024
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,800
and not to mention other things you've uploaded there.

1025
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,520
So I think having that in mind,

1026
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,360
being able to export your photos meaningfully,

1027
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,240
which Alex, it sounds like they failed there for you,

1028
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,400
that's extremely important.

1029
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,240
So for me, that's the top one

1030
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,720
and that's the one that's kept me from using Google Photos

1031
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,480
all these years is that it just makes me really uncomfortable.

1032
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,200
And so some of the tools I've relied on

1033
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,800
have been a little bit more offline tools for that reason.

1034
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,400
And like I said, I've developed my pipeline

1035
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,800
to have longevity to it.

1036
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,240
And so it's worked up till this point.

1037
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,800
Cause you're even allergic to stuff like Lightroom, right?

1038
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,720
You really don't wanna even go as far as paying Adobe any,

1039
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,120
I don't know, what's the word I'm looking for?

1040
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,800
You don't wanna give Adobe credit

1041
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,560
for going to a subscription model or whatever it is.

1042
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,240
You use a dark table if I'm not mistaken, right?

1043
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,160
I do, yeah.

1044
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,240
And you know, Alex, you touch on a little piece

1045
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,120
of my past there.

1046
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,800
So Lightroom was sort of the defacto

1047
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,120
and where I learned doing a lot

1048
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,920
of really efficient photo manipulation.

1049
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,560
And I got bit by early versions of Lightroom

1050
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,440
because their libraries weren't compatible

1051
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,640
between different versions sometimes depending,

1052
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,360
but also they would get corrupted.

1053
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:21,360
And so that was where both this desire

1054
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,560
to get away from a dependency

1055
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,440
on some of those functions came from,

1056
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,800
but also where I got introduced to open software

1057
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,560
in the first place, to open source software.

1058
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,800
And so it's funny that you mentioned Lightroom

1059
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,120
because it's the reason that I have these philosophies now

1060
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,520
and that I looked for alternatives

1061
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,400
that didn't tie all my metadata into, you know,

1062
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,400
a neat little database that could get corrupted or lost.

1063
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,480
I think it's better these days,

1064
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,360
but back then it just sort of informed my decisions.

1065
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,920
So all right, Alex, give us a rundown

1066
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,840
of some of the apps you've come across.

1067
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,000
One of the first apps I picked out was Photonics.

1068
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,160
Now this one, its headline feature

1069
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,080
is machine learning object detection.

1070
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,320
There's currently no face detection with this one,

1071
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,920
but there is active development in this area.

1072
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,360
And I ended up really liking this app for a while.

1073
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,640
And then the more I used it, the more I disliked it.

1074
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,040
I just found the interface kind of really cluttered.

1075
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,200
Now, the way I like to describe this

1076
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,560
is kind of designed by developer.

1077
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,160
It's one of those interfaces

1078
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,480
where clearly the people working on the project

1079
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,120
know every little bell and whistle,

1080
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,680
every little knob and dial to turn,

1081
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,320
but as a user coming to it fresh,

1082
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,160
I don't need to be presented with everything all at once.

1083
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,720
With a photo app in particular,

1084
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,040
the content should be front and center

1085
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,840
and then everything else should be available if I want it.

1086
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,040
There is a demo of Photonics at demo.photonics.org.

1087
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,440
Now the next one was actually a really interesting project.

1088
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,480
So it used to be called OwnPhotos

1089
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,280
and recently it was forked into the new project

1090
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,680
called LibrePhotos.

1091
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,120
This was probably,

1092
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,560
it was certainly in my top three of the apps I looked at.

1093
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,200
And there's a lot to like here.

1094
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:08,160
It's got all the important stuff like face recognition,

1095
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,760
geo lookups, object detection,

1096
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,560
and the developer recently added video support as well.

1097
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,480
And having just had a kid,

1098
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,120
I have totally changed my tune on video.

1099
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,520
Yeah, take as much video as you can, that's my advice.

1100
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,480
And particularly if it displays,

1101
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,160
just like Google Photos does,

1102
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,680
in the feed, in the timeline view,

1103
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,840
just like a photo would do.

1104
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,400
Also, and this one Brent might be of interest for you,

1105
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,080
it has a direct integration with Nextcloud via WebDAV,

1106
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,240
which enables a seamless import of images

1107
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,240
between those two applications.

1108
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,800
See, I like that because it starts to combine

1109
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,840
some applications to solve the whole solution space

1110
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,000
that Google Photos is offering,

1111
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,280
where it seems like so far,

1112
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,560
some of these are little bits and pieces.

1113
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,120
Is that what I'm getting?

1114
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,640
Right, whereas this is a sync and the photo library.

1115
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,600
And I like, I also like in here,

1116
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,600
they have a data visualization section

1117
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,400
that shows you timeline and word clouds and places tree.

1118
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,240
Oh, wow.

1119
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,080
That stuff's fun.

1120
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,720
Actually really do like the timeline stuff

1121
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,600
because I can go through there and look at,

1122
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,120
just discover a whole time period.

1123
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,480
And then pretty soon I'm starting to send pictures

1124
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,120
to my wife, oh, remember this?

1125
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,040
All of that kind of little thing,

1126
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,880
things that just kind of built into Google Photos

1127
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,720
and other software.

1128
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,960
It's nice to see that here in Libre photos.

1129
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:24,800
That's cool.

1130
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,000
Those data visualizations are cool,

1131
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,200
but ultimately, particularly the word cloud,

1132
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,320
I found it just to be a bit pointless.

1133
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,760
Like maybe if in the word cloud that's generated,

1134
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,280
so what happens is Libre photos will go through

1135
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,720
and scan your images and tag it

1136
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,840
with all the different objects it's found,

1137
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,360
you know, tree, monkey, dog.

1138
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,200
Hot dog.

1139
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,040
Hot dog.

1140
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,800
And it will generate a word cloud.

1141
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,120
And obviously the more times it finds the same word,

1142
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,040
the bigger the word becomes in the word cloud, right?

1143
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,120
Just like you'd expect.

1144
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,280
What I would expect when that happens

1145
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,280
is that I would then be able to click on that word

1146
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,440
in the web interface.

1147
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,720
And it would take me to that category of images.

1148
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,560
Yeah.

1149
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,680
Unfortunately, it doesn't do that right now.

1150
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,800
Ooh, you gotta be kidding.

1151
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,640
What's the point?

1152
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:11,480
That's no good.

1153
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:13,840
It's a small thing.

1154
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,280
But again, it's just another example

1155
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,240
of how it's designed by a developer

1156
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,200
as opposed to someone who's more focused

1157
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,560
perhaps on the user experience.

1158
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,440
Yeah, okay.

1159
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,280
All right.

1160
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,160
So Libre photos could be a contender,

1161
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,040
especially if you're in the next cloud space,

1162
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,480
but I have a sense there's something else out there.

1163
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,320
Honestly, man.

1164
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,160
There are so many.

1165
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,440
There are so many.

1166
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,440
I started off trying to write

1167
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,200
a couple of thousand word article.

1168
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:41,880
And over a week later, I'm tearing my hair out thinking,

1169
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,360
oh, there's so many options.

1170
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,880
So if I miss your favorite option,

1171
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,560
or we don't talk about it today,

1172
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,240
please, it's not a slight against you.

1173
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,800
Just let us know, linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

1174
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,640
All right.

1175
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,200
So the next one I'm gonna talk about is photo structure.

1176
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,760
Now this is the one that's got the really interesting

1177
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,960
kind of open source dilemma going on.

1178
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,560
So the application itself is closed source.

1179
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,800
There are several features that the developer

1180
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,600
has open sourced and upstreamed

1181
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,160
to various different projects.

1182
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,760
So it's kind of a, it's closed source,

1183
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,240
but it's aware of the open source ecosystem.

1184
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,080
So it's not on Adobe.

1185
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,640
It's not like an Oracle kind of level

1186
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,360
of closed source evilness,

1187
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,960
but it's also not full on freedom hippie open source either.

1188
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,520
Somewhere in the middle, interesting.

1189
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:32,320
Yeah, bear that in mind.

1190
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,800
The killer features of this app

1191
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,160
are based around photo organization.

1192
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,920
So Chris, this might be one for you.

1193
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,440
There are zero machine learning features, unfortunately,

1194
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,080
but what this one really excels at

1195
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,080
is image ingestion and management.

1196
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,000
So if you point this at a directory,

1197
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,840
it will support either existing file systems,

1198
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,760
or it will ingest and import images

1199
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,040
into its own file structure, which is still readable.

1200
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,280
It's not a database.

1201
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,520
It's just a bunch of files organized properly.

1202
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,640
It will also de-duplicate images

1203
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,800
and run on any major OS as a kind of a web app,

1204
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,200
but as a service, if that makes sense.

1205
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,560
So I run everything in a container

1206
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,960
that we're talking about here.

1207
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,120
And if you're saying that's the way you'll go to,

1208
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:20,680
but this one runs on any major OS that you'd like.

1209
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,520
Oh, okay.

1210
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,400
And it says it's been designed to handle

1211
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,280
a lifetime of photos and videos.

1212
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,440
Like all the best software,

1213
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,160
this one scratches an itch for the developer.

1214
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,480
And so it is closed source, but you can self-host it.

1215
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,280
You can run it on your own system.

1216
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,040
So it's a sustainable project, right?

1217
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,520
The developer can eat, and I think that's important.

1218
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,560
A lot of these projects are kind of

1219
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:42,840
one or two man operations,

1220
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,640
and PhotoStruxure is a one man operation,

1221
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,240
but it's his full-time job,

1222
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,560
and he can pay the bills and his mortgage with it.

1223
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,960
So he's motivated to keep working on it and add new features.

1224
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,800
And as a paid customer for PhotoStruxure,

1225
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,520
you get the ability to vote on the next features

1226
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,080
coming along and it's a meritocracy.

1227
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,400
So obviously the features with the most votes

1228
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,800
are the ones that he will work on

1229
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,640
because the people paying the bills have asked him to do so.

1230
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,480
I like that.

1231
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,160
Always nice to see software that runs and targets Linux

1232
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,880
and they've mentioned Docker right there

1233
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,600
pretty prominently, wonderful.

1234
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,440
I can live with that.

1235
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,920
All right, so PhotoStruxure looks like a serious contender,

1236
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,880
as long as I don't want the machine learning

1237
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,440
like base tagging stuff.

1238
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,600
Yeah, that is a shame.

1239
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,720
And I think obviously with time,

1240
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,920
those features will get added to it.

1241
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,080
But the thing I picked up most talking to Matthew

1242
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:34,960
was just how much care and attention and craftsmanship

1243
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,960
has gone into the backend of what's already there.

1244
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,600
By far and away, it's the most performant

1245
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,920
of any of the products that we're talking about today

1246
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,840
or any of the projects we're talking about.

1247
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,920
And I think the project has a bright future.

1248
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,320
Nice one, that had not been on my radar before.

1249
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,400
What else do we got?

1250
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,400
Well, we're moving into the kind of gallery apps,

1251
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,520
actually, no, before we do,

1252
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,520
I'll just talk about PhotoPrism.

1253
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,200
This one is open source,

1254
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,040
and there's a link to the demo in the show notes.

1255
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,560
Much like Libre Photos and Photonics,

1256
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,160
it also uses Google TensorFlow to do machine learning.

1257
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,360
It can automatically classify objects,

1258
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,920
but as of today, there's no face detection.

1259
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,640
Okay, now like our emailer,

1260
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,320
he only had a Raspberry Pi 3,

1261
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,520
so I don't think he can do TensorFlow.

1262
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,880
And what kind of requirements do I need?

1263
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,440
Do I need to have a Nvidia Tesla GPU

1264
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,040
to be able to use TensorFlow?

1265
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,720
I mean, you certainly could.

1266
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,680
You could use CUDA, I think is the Nvidia library

1267
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,680
that does that kind of stuff.

1268
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,280
But I'm just running this on an i5 eighth gen CPU.

1269
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,480
So it's only got six cores.

1270
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,320
It's not a super powerhouse or anything.

1271
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,840
Maybe it is compared to a Raspberry Pi,

1272
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,360
but it's not a data center.

1273
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,000
All right, that sounds pretty reasonable.

1274
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,160
So PhotoPrism uses TensorFlow to do all of that.

1275
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,600
And it also gives you a gallery

1276
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,200
to sort through all of that.

1277
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,800
I would imagine exposing the metadata

1278
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,640
and all that kind of stuff.

1279
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,120
I remember the UI.

1280
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,600
I remember checking it out for self-hosted,

1281
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,040
and it felt like it was really clean

1282
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,840
and simple and straightforward.

1283
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,200
I actually end up growing to hate it this week.

1284
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,600
Again, it's a design by developer problem.

1285
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,240
So if you look at the interface that I've got here,

1286
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,760
it's got eight pictures of airplanes.

1287
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,600
Actually, some of those were taken at the studio,

1288
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,240
by the way, do you remember when there was those planes

1289
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,400
flying around at the sprint?

1290
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,240
Yeah.

1291
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,600
A couple of those are from then.

1292
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,680
If you look at the pictures,

1293
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,040
if you click on an image, what would you expect to happen?

1294
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,520
I would expect the image to open.

1295
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,120
Nope, wrong, guess again.

1296
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,240
Oh no, what happens?

1297
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,360
What happens here is it begins

1298
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,360
a multi-image selection process.

1299
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,200
No.

1300
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,120
That's unacceptable.

1301
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,600
To open the image, you have to click on the tiny,

1302
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,000
tiny little translucent camera icon up in the top left.

1303
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,560
Yeah, that does seem kind of like a really simple thing,

1304
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,000
yet very frustrating thing.

1305
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,160
Which is also sometimes a magnifying glass

1306
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,280
with a plus in the middle of it.

1307
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,800
Right, right, right.

1308
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,440
And also sometimes a play button.

1309
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,080
And because it's a web app,

1310
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,480
God only knows what could be going on

1311
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,600
with your web browser at that moment,

1312
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,200
where the first click isn't even registered.

1313
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,960
Right, so there are little things with PhotoPrism

1314
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,760
that could use work, and again,

1315
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,920
it's mostly user interface and experience stuff.

1316
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,160
They do have really great documentation

1317
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:11,480
on a WebDAV feature, so much like Libre Photos,

1318
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,920
you can integrate this with Nextcloud,

1319
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,720
but also you can mount this via WebDAV

1320
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,600
from your desktop computer.

1321
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,480
So Brent, maybe this could be one for you.

1322
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:24,800
I'm thinking with DigiCam or Darktable or something.

1323
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,240
Yeah, it does sound really interesting

1324
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,800
because it seems to blend the internet world

1325
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:31,160
with my here at home in my cave world.

1326
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,280
And here's what I'm trying to wrap my head around, Brent.

1327
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,080
So you take all these photos, you know,

1328
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,240
you got a whole, I would imagine,

1329
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,760
a nice library of faces and objects.

1330
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,960
Have you ever considered how nice it would be

1331
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,720
to be able to just expose like every picture

1332
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,320
of this particular face or person

1333
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,760
or every photo that has this plant in it?

1334
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,560
Like that seems like that would be extremely useful

1335
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,720
for a professional.

1336
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,800
It's a feature I've dreamt of for decades.

1337
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,960
And so I will say, I will admit to absolutely everyone

1338
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,240
that my methods are deprecated

1339
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,240
and only because they've worked

1340
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:06,200
and I haven't really needed a better way,

1341
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,680
although you guys are all making me realize

1342
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,440
that I'm suffering a little bit

1343
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:11,800
without some of these features.

1344
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,640
So I am all ears.

1345
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,080
Hey Alex, I'm thinking we do

1346
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,640
a total self-hosted makeover for the photos

1347
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,440
for Brent in a future episode of self-hosted, you know?

1348
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,280
It's an intervention.

1349
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,360
Yeah, we'll show up.

1350
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,280
We'll have like this whole server set up for you.

1351
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,520
We'll show you the whole workflow

1352
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,720
and get the Brent stamp of approval and then deploy it

1353
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,400
and get all of your images recognized.

1354
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,240
And it'll be a full photo makeover.

1355
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,640
I'll expect a link to the gallery of that event.

1356
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,800
Okay, so that's PhotoPrism and it is open source.

1357
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,960
So that checks a box, it supports web dev.

1358
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,920
So that makes it pretty flexible.

1359
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,160
Is there any other ones we should mention?

1360
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,400
Cause you know, look, I wanted to mention,

1361
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,240
I think it was at Leachy, we've used that before.

1362
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,640
I think we still have that somewhere running actually.

1363
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,960
We do gallery.selfhosted.show.

1364
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,000
There's a few of my own personal images in there.

1365
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,200
And this one's really interesting

1366
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,560
cause it kind of somewhat blurs the line

1367
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:02,520
between a straightforward gallery app

1368
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,360
and a photo management app.

1369
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,440
And the reason I say that is because

1370
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,480
you can organize images into albums,

1371
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,920
but you can also edit the metadata of these images.

1372
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,720
Now, a lot of these programs that we've talked about

1373
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,760
have next to no image editing features.

1374
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,240
We're talking not a single one on this list

1375
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,920
allows you to crop an image.

1376
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,960
A couple of them allow you to rotate,

1377
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,560
Leachy's one of those.

1378
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,880
But I mean, I can't crop an image in any of these.

1379
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,280
I was, I couldn't believe that.

1380
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,840
Yeah, I think I'm kind of coming to the conclusion

1381
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:37,160
that my strategy for that would be local editing.

1382
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,280
So something like Shotwell or Darktable for local edits,

1383
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,280
which I think that's what you're doing now, Wes.

1384
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:46,520
And so that's why the ones that support WebDAV

1385
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,560
are kind of appealing to me

1386
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,480
because I could see using both tools.

1387
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,160
One is a viewing and searching tool and discovery tool

1388
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,600
that I can, oh, look at this great pic.

1389
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,000
I can quickly copy it and paste it into Telegram, right?

1390
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,040
That's one tool.

1391
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,840
And then the other tool is that one

1392
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,160
where I've gone a little bit in

1393
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,440
and I maybe crop something to make it a nicer shot

1394
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,280
or something like that.

1395
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,160
And I can save it back to the same source location.

1396
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,840
During one of those editing sessions,

1397
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,800
maybe when you have the itch

1398
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,960
or you're getting back from a trip

1399
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:11,960
and you're kind of going through things.

1400
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,840
Right, right.

1401
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,160
What would be a really nice feature

1402
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,840
is if you could use some of these apps we're talking about

1403
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,280
as your sort of photo organization method

1404
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,360
and then have this, let me dream here for a moment,

1405
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,560
have this method to just sort of,

1406
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,960
I don't know, you can't right click in here,

1407
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,640
but right click and go open in Darktable

1408
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,640
or open in Glimpse or something like that

1409
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,840
and then do your cropping and your photo adjusting.

1410
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,160
And that way they don't have to sort of rely on that stuff.

1411
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,400
Yeah, I think you've just described

1412
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,440
the mobile experience now.

1413
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,960
Mm-hmm, exactly.

1414
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,600
Dang it.

1415
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,920
Well, and the reality is whenever you wanna share stuff

1416
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,680
with family, oftentimes you're on the go

1417
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:53,080
or you've got five minutes while you're waiting

1418
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,840
on somebody else to do something or in a lineup at the bank.

1419
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,440
I say the bank, who goes to the bank anymore?

1420
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,400
But you know what I mean?

1421
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,240
Hey, I went and deposited a check in person this week

1422
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,560
for the first time in a long time.

1423
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,400
Where did you go?

1424
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,400
Caveman, welcome back.

1425
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,760
But I found even for me, like I'm sharing most of my stuff

1426
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:15,440
from mobile, not to clients, but to everybody else.

1427
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,800
And so that's an essential feature.

1428
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,720
I'll tell you what Brent, sharing images via link

1429
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:23,080
is actually a surprisingly difficult thing to get right

1430
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,520
apparently in this space.

1431
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,440
Lychee does this best in my opinion.

1432
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,200
It allows you to generate different URLs for social media,

1433
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,240
but also, and this is a really cool feature,

1434
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,680
Lychee will let you generate images automatically scaled

1435
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:37,120
to certain resolutions.

1436
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,480
That's directly in its sharing pane.

1437
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,320
That's Lychee, L-Y-C-H-E-E.

1438
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,720
And if you wanna see an example of it,

1439
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,960
you can go to gallery.selfhosted.show.

1440
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,640
And it's pretty straightforward.

1441
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,960
Do you think maybe this is the most straightforward

1442
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,280
of all of them to get up and running

1443
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,120
and just share photos with somebody?

1444
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,320
Yeah, I think it's probably my favorite app overall

1445
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,040
in this entire rundown.

1446
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,560
The downside is it has no machine learning features.

1447
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:05,360
So if you want that kind of search organization,

1448
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,760
it doesn't have that.

1449
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,640
Like you say in your article,

1450
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,960
it's a great front end to whatever else you're using

1451
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,480
to make your photos look great and organize them well.

1452
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,720
That's where it shines.

1453
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,080
So I have a link to some of these projects

1454
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,200
that we've mentioned here on the show.

1455
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,000
So that way you don't have to worry about the weird names

1456
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,040
at linuxunplug.com slash 409.

1457
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:26,680
Now, if I could just do one final little honorable mention.

1458
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:29,560
I came across an app called File Run on Self Hosted

1459
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,120
a few months ago,

1460
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,440
and I actually ended up using it quite a bit for photos

1461
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,800
because it has a bunch of image processing stuff

1462
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,120
in the background.

1463
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,480
And all File Run does is it's a web app

1464
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,240
that presents an underlying file system in the web browser.

1465
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,560
And it supports full text and has metadata search as well,

1466
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,320
which if you think about it,

1467
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,760
apart from the machine learning stuff it's missing,

1468
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,360
is actually half the battle.

1469
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,120
So this is at filerun.com,

1470
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,300
and this would totally be one of our tools

1471
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,680
in the total photo makeover for Brent, Alex.

1472
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,760
And the UI is surprisingly nice.

1473
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,560
For something that I've wanted for so long,

1474
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,840
just your files available in mobile

1475
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,280
or in a full web version in a really nice UI.

1476
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,180
And, although I don't really think

1477
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,080
you probably use this much,

1478
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,160
but it has plugins too for things like Google Apps

1479
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,460
and Office 365 and Autodesk and a lot of those things.

1480
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,160
Autodesk, what?

1481
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,320
Yeah, so you can pull in CAD files, isn't that funny?

1482
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,280
Why not, man?

1483
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,540
And if all you have lying around is a Raspberry Pi,

1484
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,240
this might be the way to go.

1485
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,040
Yeah, throw File Run on there,

1486
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,040
do your file uploads right there,

1487
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,040
and then maybe leechy on top of that

1488
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:38,640
to do some of the display and sharing.

1489
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,960
That could be a nice way to go.

1490
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,880
Absolutely, and I think it just highlights clearly

1491
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,680
that none of these apps check all of these boxes.

1492
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,840
You're gonna have to have probably NextCloud

1493
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,680
to get the images off your device,

1494
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,920
and then something else to organize and edit them.

1495
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,520
Well, actually something else to organize them,

1496
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,980
something else to edit them,

1497
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:00,480
like a DigiCam or whatever it might be.

1498
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,680
And then something else maybe to display them as well.

1499
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,040
So very quickly you've got a stack

1500
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,000
of three or four apps here.

1501
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,440
And I ended up coming to the conclusion

1502
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,180
that unless some of these apps

1503
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:14,680
are able to kind of pool together their resources,

1504
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,980
we're not gonna see a true Google Photos alternative

1505
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:22,640
that ticks all the boxes for some time.

1506
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,760
Yeah, and then it just has to, I suppose,

1507
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,520
be that question of pragmatism versus idealism,

1508
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,440
and how much work are you willing to put in for your photos?

1509
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,840
Right, here you get to and have to build your own pipeline

1510
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,840
with Google Photos, they've done it for you,

1511
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,160
but you don't get any input on how it works.

1512
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,680
And maybe for something like your photos

1513
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,080
that you wanna have a 25-year grasp on

1514
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,840
or something like that at a time,

1515
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,760
maybe that's worth getting out the old, you know,

1516
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,880
artisan, craftsman kind of mindset and building something.

1517
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,000
I think it might be for me.

1518
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,160
I've always been teetering on this.

1519
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,920
And I also sometimes wonder if perhaps

1520
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,640
it isn't maybe the perfect sweet spot

1521
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,640
to build something locally that's like this,

1522
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,800
and maybe still loop in some service to do backups,

1523
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,960
because that's how important the photos are to me.

1524
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,520
Well, Google Photos, I think, is still an excellent choice

1525
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,680
for your offsite backup.

1526
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,720
If you're following the 3-2-1 principle for your backups,

1527
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,320
Google Photos is a fantastic choice.

1528
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,120
I should also mention at this point that Amazon,

1529
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,960
if you're a Prime subscriber,

1530
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,080
has free unlimited photo storage for now.

1531
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,240
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

1532
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,800
Yep, that's just it.

1533
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,080
And it may be in some weird, twisted way,

1534
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,520
Google's transition to actually making you pay

1535
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,920
for the storage that you use for Google Photos

1536
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,400
may actually be the thing that makes it sustainable

1537
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,880
and stick around for a long time.

1538
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,800
And maybe that is in some weird ways a good thing.

1539
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,080
It doesn't mean they're not mining your data,

1540
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,920
but at least they're not just gonna randomly

1541
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,480
shut down the service on you.

1542
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,040
So if you wanna add it to your arsenal of photo options,

1543
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:54,240
that's a great way to go.

1544
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,560
I think it works best as a complimentary offsite backup

1545
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,920
and not the primary.

1546
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,760
And I think that's where having a local cache

1547
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,600
that I can then throw into these tools

1548
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,720
that we've just covered

1549
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,400
is gonna make me feel a lot more comfortable.

1550
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,880
So thanks for the rundown, Alex.

1551
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,080
Absolutely, you're very welcome.

1552
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:11,280
I mean, there's, like I say,

1553
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,280
there's loads and loads of other options

1554
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,120
we didn't get time to talk about today.

1555
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,240
You know, PyWeGo, PyGallery2, Pixel Fed,

1556
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,920
PhotoView, Thumbs Up, Koken.

1557
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,400
I mean, the list goes on and on.

1558
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,400
Let's UNLOCK and we'll get started.

1559
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,960
jupitrgarage.com is getting restocked

1560
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,400
with some brand new items.

1561
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,240
They're not in yet, but for the first time,

1562
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,960
we've reached that goal of clearing out a lot of the old,

1563
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,360
not everything, not everything,

1564
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,800
but we have made enough room to bring in some of the new,

1565
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,760
which was always, always the goal.

1566
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,960
We are beginning that process right now.

1567
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:51,280
I am gonna keep it simple and humble like we have been,

1568
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,520
you know, baby steps here,

1569
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,460
can grab the seasoned tux tee on sale right now.

1570
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,020
That's a shirt that I created.

1571
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:57,700
It's a new item.

1572
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:05,860
It is a all black t-shirt with a gray and dark gray bearded version of the tux

1573
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:07,460
holding the Jupiter broadcasting rocket.

1574
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:11,420
The, uh, the, the seasoned tux, as I call it.

1575
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:14,080
And, uh, it's on sale right now at Jupiter garage.com.

1576
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,780
If you'd like to grab one.

1577
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:24,380
And now for some feedback, Mark from Lenovo writes in.

1578
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,620
Hello, Chris and Wes.

1579
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:31,740
I'm the technical lead for the Linux PC team at Lenovo.

1580
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,460
Hello, Mark.

1581
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:39,420
I was listening to episode 405 and you mentioned the battery life on the X1 Carbon.

1582
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:43,740
I figured it would be interesting to reach out to the firmware slash hardware team

1583
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,980
here for their input.

1584
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:52,220
I've now got a bunch of battery related ACPI APIs that I need to go through and

1585
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,620
see how they fit into what the kernel has.

1586
01:01:54,660 --> 01:02:00,700
Although most of them are there already, but I also got some feedback on battery

1587
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,980
charging thresholds looking through the docs.

1588
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:10,460
One of the things I noted is that charging thresholds really depend on typical usage.

1589
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:11,980
So here's the scenario.

1590
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:17,300
If you regularly fully discharge the battery, then actually the default setting

1591
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:24,620
of starting to charge at 95% and going up to 100% is apparently fine.

1592
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:31,500
But in a different scenario, if you regularly somewhat discharge the battery, but not all

1593
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:37,700
the way, say operating between 50% and a hundred percent, then the techs recommend

1594
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:42,820
starting charging at 75% and stopping at 80%.

1595
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:48,300
And for a final scenario, if you're connected to power the majority of the time, in that

1596
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:51,780
case, you want to start at 45 stop at 50.

1597
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:55,780
I was surprised, frankly, at how small the windows were.

1598
01:02:56,220 --> 01:03:00,180
I expected to see something more like 30% to 80%.

1599
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:06,260
And I've also got some questions in to better understand typical degradation, like is

1600
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:10,660
dropping to 96% in the first six months actually normal?

1601
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:14,180
No idea what the curve looks like in most cases.

1602
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,260
Holler if you have any questions.

1603
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:20,500
Happy to forward those on to the hardware team to Mark.

1604
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:21,740
Well, thanks, Mark.

1605
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:25,580
I think the the the bit that stands out and that's from the Lenovo team that stands out

1606
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:29,700
to me is if you're connected to power the majority of the time with your ThinkPad, you

1607
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:33,580
should try to keep your battery charge in the 45 to 50% range.

1608
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,420
I wish I knew that earlier.

1609
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:36,460
Yeah. And Mark's right.

1610
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:39,580
That is a really that's a 5% range that is really small.

1611
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:42,140
I am achieving that with TLP right now.

1612
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:47,140
And it bit me once because, of course, I was I was off grid, open up the laptop.

1613
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:49,300
It only had 50% battery.

1614
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:50,820
Oh, right.

1615
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:53,180
I need to take action beforehand.

1616
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:58,020
But we got a bunch of feedback in about how people are extending battery life or managing

1617
01:03:58,020 --> 01:03:59,620
TLP on Linux.

1618
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:02,700
So if you've already sent an email to that regard, we received it.

1619
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:06,780
But if you haven't yet and you have some battery management tips or the ways that you've

1620
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:11,820
used TLP or things that you found that have extended your Linux battery life, please get

1621
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:15,780
those in now at Linux unplugged dot com slash contact, because I think we're going to do

1622
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:19,980
a batch of feedback next week and kind of put a cap on this battery discussion because

1623
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:24,180
I have received a few cool tricks from the audience that I want to relay to everybody.

1624
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:29,060
And I went on this trip the entire time using TLP, have some regrets, but also I think

1625
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:30,100
there was some positives to it.

1626
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:33,100
So we'll follow up next episode on that.

1627
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:37,300
And thank you to Mark for reaching out from Lenovo and getting some info straight from

1628
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:42,500
the team. I really appreciate the ability to pass on that to the community because, you

1629
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,700
know, that's straight from, as they say, the horse's mouth.

1630
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:50,420
So Linux unplugged dot com slash contact for your feedback and whatnot.

1631
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:52,580
We are back to our regular live time.

1632
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:58,740
So if you'd like to join us for a live episode, we do them on Tuesdays at noon Pacific, 3

1633
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,580
p.m. Eastern over at J.B.

1634
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:02,940
Live TV. Thank you to our members.

1635
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:06,580
Those of you who have become members, you get access to the limited ad version of the

1636
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:08,580
show and the full live stream.

1637
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:11,180
So thank you very much to our unplugged core members.

1638
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:12,980
You all are the very best.

1639
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:16,900
See you next week. Same bad time, same bad station.

1640
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:21,620
That's right. Either way, it comes out every week over at Linux unplugged dot com.

1641
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:25,820
You can go to Linux unplugged dot com slash subscribe to get the feeds for all different

1642
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:31,020
players that you like, and you can follow the show on the Twitter at Linux unplugged.

1643
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:35,660
You can follow the West at West Paine can follow me at Chris Lass.

1644
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:39,860
But you know what? It's really if you want to get something to show, it's probably best to

1645
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:42,740
use the contact page that works probably the best.

1646
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:46,260
But, you know, I haven't mentioned the matrix in a while and the major community continues

1647
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,180
to grow. Despite that, shout out to them.

1648
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:50,740
Info at Linux unplugged dot com slash matrix.

1649
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,820
We're in there. We're hanging out. It's a great spot.

1650
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:59,300
So thanks so much for joining us and we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1651
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:40,100
So has anybody given the old Google take out a try to get their photos out, Alex?

1652
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:41,380
I know you were experimenting with that.

1653
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,500
We talked about it in the show briefly, didn't we?

1654
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:51,220
And my link came in today, funnily enough, and I have I'm now the proud owner of a hundred

1655
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:54,300
and forty four two gigabyte files.

1656
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:57,300
That's how they gave me the takeout stuff.

1657
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,940
Holy. And then how do you download that?

1658
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:01,100
What's the UI to download?

1659
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:06,660
Is it a URL? Like it's an email with one hundred and forty four individual links in it.

1660
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:08,180
There's no download all button.

1661
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:10,500
You just have to go through them one by one.

1662
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:14,260
That's interesting because with Google Play Music, you had the option of downloading

1663
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:15,620
everything as a large zip file.

1664
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:18,020
That doesn't really seem like that great of an option, Alex.

1665
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:20,740
I got to say. But, yeah, I mean, come on.

1666
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:27,740
I've I've got 10, 15 years worth of images in there and every SLR image I've ever taken,

1667
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:30,180
every mobile image. So there's a lot of data in there.

1668
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:51,300
So one massive zip file wouldn't really be very feasible, I don't think.
