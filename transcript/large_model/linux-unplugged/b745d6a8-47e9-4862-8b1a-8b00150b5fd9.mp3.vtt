WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.540
So don't tell Noah, but I'm kind of becoming more of a Kodi guy and less of a Plex guy

00:05.540 --> 00:07.560
and less of an MB guy.

00:07.560 --> 00:13.360
I just have such a crappy internet connection at home that having local media is, not only

00:13.360 --> 00:19.040
is it way faster to play and makes fast forward and rewind possible, but I can do full resolution

00:19.040 --> 00:24.020
video like Blu-ray quality video and it plays.

00:24.020 --> 00:25.600
And Kodi is so great.

00:25.600 --> 00:26.600
Kodi's awesome.

00:26.600 --> 00:30.600
When you have multiple audio sources in a file or subtitles or anything and you just

00:30.600 --> 00:34.520
want to quickly use the remote to turn it on or switch audio tracks, it's so good at

00:34.520 --> 00:35.520
that.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.320
And the playback is so flawless with Kodi.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.320
That's awesome.

00:38.320 --> 00:43.400
I just, I am such a huge fan of Kodi and I kind of had moved away for a while because

00:43.400 --> 00:48.160
I was using Plex and having central storage, but that only works when you have a really

00:48.160 --> 00:49.160
fast connection.

00:49.160 --> 00:50.160
Right.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.160
When you live in society.

00:51.160 --> 00:52.160
Yeah, exactly.

00:52.160 --> 00:55.840
Wes, I just wanted to say thank you to Kodi and the Kodi folks.

00:55.840 --> 00:59.120
I am really looking forward to Kodi 17 when it comes out.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.120
Have you tried that MB plug-in?

01:01.120 --> 01:02.440
Not that it might not work for you now.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.440
No, you know I should have.

01:03.440 --> 01:04.440
Because I use that.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.440
I still have it.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.440
I've had plenty of experience with it.

01:06.440 --> 01:07.440
Now tell me about that.

01:07.440 --> 01:11.320
Well, because it just makes Kodi's library basically transparent to the MB back in store.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.120
What I haven't tried is using that and having your own local files.

01:14.120 --> 01:17.520
That'd be interesting because then you could have your local stuff and if you got back

01:17.520 --> 01:19.600
on the network you could have the full MB.

01:19.600 --> 01:23.920
So I have that set up with some friends and they stream it over the network so then it

01:23.920 --> 01:25.720
doesn't tax my MB server.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.400
But Kodi plays it locally.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.240
And you know what all those files are, Wes?

01:29.240 --> 01:31.560
All those files are freaking DRM free.

01:31.560 --> 01:36.280
That way we are celebrating International Day Against DRM, May 3rd, 2016.

01:36.280 --> 01:40.480
Oh yeah, here comes the weaponized lawnmower.

01:40.480 --> 01:41.480
It's coming again, Wes.

01:41.480 --> 01:42.480
Do you hear it?

01:42.480 --> 01:43.480
I've closed the windows.

01:43.480 --> 01:44.480
I've battened down the hatches.

01:44.480 --> 01:45.480
I've battened down the hatches.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.480
I took out the fan.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.480
We still have a weaponized lawnmower out there.

01:47.480 --> 01:51.640
So today is the 10th International Day Against DRM.

01:51.640 --> 01:57.760
And you, Wes, need to take a few steps to take actions against DRM.

01:57.760 --> 01:58.760
Are you ready?

01:58.760 --> 01:59.760
Are you ready?

01:59.760 --> 02:00.760
Here we go.

02:00.760 --> 02:04.120
Take a selfie.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.120
My beautiful face.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.120
Yeah, okay.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.120
So we need to take a selfie.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.120
Okay?

02:08.120 --> 02:09.120
So are you taking a selfie, Wes?

02:09.120 --> 02:11.840
So this is what it says, affectedbydesign.org.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.480
Take a selfie and sign the petition.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.880
Envision a future victory against DRM.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.120
So this is something you could do.

02:18.120 --> 02:21.840
So while you're taking a selfie, I want you to envision a future without DRM.

02:21.840 --> 02:23.680
This is how you can help me.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.640
You look really good there, Wes.

02:25.640 --> 02:30.920
You can add your graphics to your social media profile or your blog.

02:30.920 --> 02:35.340
You could submit a DRM horror story to the EFF.

02:35.340 --> 02:38.680
You could make a blog post or video or a song.

02:38.680 --> 02:42.400
Or you could share their DRM-free living guide with your friends.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.200
Those are statements that you can take for actions against DRM.

02:45.200 --> 02:52.640
Now, this is less stupid than telling everyone to go and DDoS the Apple store.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.640
Okay, all right.

02:53.640 --> 02:54.640
Okay.

02:54.640 --> 02:55.640
That was years past.

02:55.640 --> 02:56.640
Yeah.

02:56.640 --> 03:01.520
This is a positive campaign, raising awareness.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.560
I could get behind this.

03:03.560 --> 03:08.840
I'm not sure what my anti-DRM face is going to be that I'm going to pull when I do my

03:08.840 --> 03:10.920
selfie, but I'll have a good go.

03:10.920 --> 03:12.720
I have a recommendation.

03:12.720 --> 03:13.720
Shave your mustache.

03:13.720 --> 03:14.720
Definitely.

03:14.720 --> 03:15.720
Yeah.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.720
That's all you need.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.920
Oh, it's a little breezy in here on the lip.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.000
It's a little breezy.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.220
I just don't know about this defective by design.

03:26.220 --> 03:31.240
It just seems like it's been a bit of a snoozer from day one.

03:31.240 --> 03:32.280
It's never for 10 years now.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.000
It's failed to really get my interest.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.960
I do support it in principle.

03:36.960 --> 03:37.960
Yeah?

03:37.960 --> 03:39.360
Maybe I will post something.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.360
So hang on.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.360
Let me get this straight.

03:41.360 --> 03:44.960
I'm going to shave my mustache so that I look like an Amish person.

03:44.960 --> 03:45.960
Right.

03:45.960 --> 03:46.960
Is that what you want?

03:46.960 --> 03:47.960
Right.

03:47.960 --> 03:48.960
Yes.

03:48.960 --> 03:49.960
Yes.

03:49.960 --> 03:50.960
Yes.

03:50.960 --> 03:51.960
Ideally.

03:51.960 --> 03:52.960
I'm watching.

03:52.960 --> 03:53.960
Okay.

03:53.960 --> 03:54.960
That sounds like a great idea.

03:54.960 --> 03:55.960
You're watching.

03:55.960 --> 03:56.960
Wimpy's watching the playback right now.

03:56.960 --> 03:57.960
This is Linux Unplugged episode 143 for May 3rd, 2016.

03:57.960 --> 04:14.480
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that already has your gift

04:14.480 --> 04:16.400
picked out for Mother's Day.

04:16.400 --> 04:18.400
Yes, it's almost Mother's Day.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.440
My name is Chris.

04:19.440 --> 04:20.440
My name is Wes.

04:20.440 --> 04:23.480
Here's your official reminder before the weekend, everybody.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.480
Hello, Wes.

04:24.480 --> 04:25.480
Guess what?

04:25.480 --> 04:31.160
We've secretly made a big show for 143 coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged

04:31.160 --> 04:32.160
program.

04:32.160 --> 04:36.480
We have some fascinating open source updates from funding to projects that are missing

04:36.480 --> 04:37.480
deadlines and targets.

04:37.480 --> 04:38.480
Oh, I'm not saying anything.

04:38.480 --> 04:39.480
Shh.

04:39.480 --> 04:43.440
I'm not saying anything as well as some great updates.

04:43.440 --> 04:45.440
Another look at VR under Linux.

04:45.440 --> 04:50.080
We're going to discuss Subsonic going to closed source after years of open source.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.080
What?

04:51.080 --> 04:52.080
Yes, yes.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.240
And then don't tune out.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.760
We're actually not done talking about Ubuntu 16.04.

04:55.760 --> 04:56.760
No way.

04:56.760 --> 04:57.760
But don't worry.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.600
We wouldn't be doing it for a third week in a row unless we actually thought there was

05:00.600 --> 05:02.720
something genuinely worth your time to talk about.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.760
So you'll just have to trust us coming up in a little bit.

05:05.760 --> 05:07.600
Yes, and yes, it's true.

05:07.600 --> 05:11.240
I am mustache free this week.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.240
That's me brushing where the mustache once was.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.040
If it wasn't, but he's still handsome.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.240
We're going to power through it.

05:15.240 --> 05:25.720
And to help us, Mr. West brought us some extremely unique and delicious beers from Diamond Knot

05:25.720 --> 05:28.960
Brewery, a place special in my heart.

05:28.960 --> 05:29.960
I did not know this.

05:29.960 --> 05:30.960
No, you didn't.

05:30.960 --> 05:31.960
No, you didn't.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.160
I'm drinking the Binnacle Ale, the summer ale.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.160
I think that's how you say it.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.160
I believe so.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.160
And you'll be drinking.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.160
The brown ale.

05:37.160 --> 05:39.120
The brown ale.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.600
Now why is Diamond Knot near and dear to my heart?

05:42.600 --> 05:46.480
Now we're going to get into all the Linux-y stuff first, but before we do that, I want

05:46.480 --> 05:49.080
to go back in time, if we can, just really quickly.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.600
A different time in Chris's life.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.360
You know what's crazy about this?

05:52.360 --> 05:54.840
It was May 7th that we released this.

05:54.840 --> 05:59.840
It was probably about May 3rd in 2010 that I shot this video.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.440
So think about this, Wes.

06:01.440 --> 06:08.040
You brought me a beer almost like on the six year anniversary since I shot this video.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.240
That is kind of remarkable.

06:09.240 --> 06:13.560
Here we are at the Diamond Knot Brewery, the very place we are drinking these beers from.

06:13.560 --> 06:19.160
For beers tasty, which you may recall from days past, which, hold on, sorry.

06:19.160 --> 06:20.160
Hold on.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.920
So where we're at right now is the very highest point.

06:21.920 --> 06:25.080
We can look down at all the people of what we're getting into today.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.080
That's Wes.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.080
Yeah.

06:28.080 --> 06:36.600
So there's a, if you're watching the video version, a little tour of their brewery, which

06:36.600 --> 06:37.600
is nice.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.600
One of their breweries.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.360
We're going to go to their locations now.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.840
And the beard on this guy we're about to talk to.

06:42.840 --> 06:43.840
Oh, what's that in your hand?

06:43.840 --> 06:45.320
Oh, that is a delicious Bursky.

06:45.320 --> 06:49.160
All right, so here we are.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.240
We are still here at Diamond Knot and we've got Pat.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.760
Now Pat's the guy you want to talk to at Diamond Knot Brewery because he knows all about the

06:54.760 --> 06:55.760
different beers here.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.560
He is, I kid you not, the brewmaster.

06:57.560 --> 06:58.560
I want that title.

06:58.560 --> 07:01.360
What does a brewmaster do at Diamond Knot?

07:01.360 --> 07:03.960
Makes all bow to me.

07:03.960 --> 07:04.960
That's pretty rad.

07:04.960 --> 07:05.960
Nice, dude.

07:05.960 --> 07:06.960
So tell us a little bit.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.560
So we're in a, we're kind of in a, maybe for you, a kind of an older location, right?

07:10.560 --> 07:13.320
These are still in production, but this.

07:13.320 --> 07:19.560
I spent my first five years in this tiny space alone.

07:19.560 --> 07:20.560
This was a fun episode.

07:20.560 --> 07:25.860
So as brewmaster, I'm responsible basically for all beer operations here at Diamond Knot.

07:25.860 --> 07:29.600
So we do a series of interviews with these guys, find out about the brews they make.

07:29.600 --> 07:34.000
And if you guys are curious, I will put a link to this old shenanigans in the show notes.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.120
It is actually pretty cool to go behind the scenes and see all the different stuff they

07:37.120 --> 07:38.120
do.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.120
Yeah, it really is.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.120
Old episode of Beer is Tasty and we do an interview with the brewmaster from the very

07:42.120 --> 07:44.080
place that we're drinking beer from today.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.360
So that's pretty cool there, Wes.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.360
How neat is that?

07:46.360 --> 07:49.360
Thanks for bringing in the good old Diamond Knot Brewery.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.360
That's a fun one.

07:50.360 --> 07:51.360
All right.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.160
So let's not go any further without bringing our virtual lug.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.720
Time Appropriate Greetings, Mamba Room.

07:54.720 --> 07:55.720
Hello.

07:55.720 --> 07:56.720
Whiskey.

07:56.720 --> 07:57.720
Time Appropriate Greetings.

07:57.720 --> 07:58.720
Hello.

07:58.720 --> 07:59.720
Time Appropriate Greetings.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.720
Hello.

08:00.720 --> 08:01.720
Hello.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.720
Hello.

08:02.720 --> 08:03.720
Yes.

08:03.720 --> 08:04.720
Good to talk to you.

08:04.720 --> 08:08.680
But I wanted to, before we get into the super, super heavy stuff, I did want to maybe discuss

08:08.680 --> 08:11.480
really quickly DuckDuckGo.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.280
I'm personally a fan of DuckDuckGo.

08:13.280 --> 08:16.320
I like kind of what they're about.

08:16.320 --> 08:21.880
They've worked with JB in the past and so I wanted to just mention that they're still

08:21.880 --> 08:22.880
out there.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.880
They're still out there contributing to open source software and they've made some pretty

08:25.880 --> 08:31.660
big contributions recently, including some serious cash to some of our favorite open

08:31.660 --> 08:33.880
source projects and some important ones like SecureDrop.

08:33.880 --> 08:38.160
My name is Gabriel Weinberg and I'm the founder of DuckDuckGo.

08:38.160 --> 08:42.920
Six years ago, when DuckDuckGo was just me and the servers were still in my basement,

08:42.920 --> 08:47.760
I started donating to free and open source projects that I depended on every day.

08:47.760 --> 08:52.400
A lot of these projects were like DuckDuckGo in that they were labors of love by just a

08:52.400 --> 08:55.120
few people working in their spare time.

08:55.120 --> 08:59.520
I wanted them to know how important their projects were to me and to lend a little financial

08:59.520 --> 09:01.240
support where I could.

09:01.240 --> 09:06.600
So we've got $25,000 to the Freedom of Press Foundation for SecureDrop, which is a secure

09:06.600 --> 09:10.280
way for people to communicate like leaks and stuff like that.

09:10.280 --> 09:16.920
$25,000 to the FreeNet Project, $25,000 to the OpenBSD Foundation.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.680
Crypt Tech Project is $25,000.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.640
The Tor Project is $25,000.

09:20.640 --> 09:23.180
Fight for the Future gets $25,000.

09:23.180 --> 09:25.640
Open Source Technology Innovation Fund for FairCrypt gets $25,000.

09:25.640 --> 09:26.640
That's interesting.

09:26.640 --> 09:27.640
Yeah, I thought so.

09:27.640 --> 09:32.360
GPG Tools for GPG Mail, $25,000.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.360
Couple other ones in here.

09:33.360 --> 09:34.360
Pretty neat, Wes.

09:34.360 --> 09:35.360
That's a lot of money.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.360
Good old DuckDuckGo.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.960
Remember, just a reminder, if you haven't used them recently for your search.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.280
Go send a few searches their way.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.680
I imagine Popey's probably exhausted.

09:43.680 --> 09:48.560
However, I don't see him in this screenshot here, so maybe not.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.820
I imagine he was sitting in and watching both Baited Breath.

09:51.820 --> 09:58.040
But Michael Alibril over at Ferronix is bringing us the latest from the Ubuntu Online Summit

09:58.040 --> 09:59.040
for Ubuntu 16.10.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.040
16.10, Wes.

10:00.040 --> 10:01.040
Oh, yeah.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.040
The future.

10:02.040 --> 10:05.040
Get off your 16.04 high horse.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.040
Fine.

10:06.040 --> 10:10.880
Well, it's another setback for Unity 8 and Mirror, Michael writes.

10:10.880 --> 10:14.660
It's been confirmed that the Unity 8 desktop and the Mirror display server will not be

10:14.660 --> 10:18.800
the default for the desktop spin in Ubuntu 16.10.

10:18.800 --> 10:19.800
Yakety yak.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.800
That's a fun name.

10:21.800 --> 10:26.520
Unity 8 and Mirror will be available as opt-in features for users wanting to upgrade their

10:26.520 --> 10:27.520
desktop.

10:27.520 --> 10:31.760
But Unity 7 and Xorg will be the default for 16.10.

10:31.760 --> 10:35.600
So disappointed, Wes?

10:35.600 --> 10:37.440
I mean, I still want to try it.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.600
I'm curious to see when it lands.

10:39.600 --> 10:46.560
Maybe it makes sense to be in the next, you know, big update, but I'm not that surprised.

10:46.560 --> 10:51.760
Popey, was it ever really planned that 16.10 would be where Mirror would land?

10:51.760 --> 10:52.760
By default?

10:52.760 --> 10:53.760
Was that ever really a thing?

10:53.760 --> 10:54.760
I don't think so.

10:54.760 --> 10:55.760
It's a setback, Popey.

10:55.760 --> 10:56.760
It's a setback.

10:56.760 --> 10:57.760
Is it?

10:57.760 --> 11:04.080
Or is it just a really good idea to not dump stuff on people when it's not ready yet?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.080
Exactly.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.080
Which we learn from, you know, past experience.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.600
See also PulseAudio and Unity 7.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.600
Yeah.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.600
We've learned this.

11:11.600 --> 11:14.120
You know what would be a setback is it being a bomb and people hating it.

11:14.120 --> 11:16.120
That'd be a bit of a setback.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.120
Yeah.

11:17.120 --> 11:21.400
However, I do appreciate Larbal tuning in and following this stuff at the same time.

11:21.400 --> 11:24.420
So I don't want to give him too much crap because I am actually glad he's reporting

11:24.420 --> 11:25.560
on it.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.800
There's not a lot of original reporting in the Linux community.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.400
So it's actually nice to see some getting done.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.400
I don't know.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.400
A setback?

11:33.400 --> 11:36.680
Well, you can read it both ways.

11:36.680 --> 11:40.920
You know, either people want stuff to land like, come on, you need to have this stuff

11:40.920 --> 11:41.920
ready.

11:41.920 --> 11:42.920
I want to see it now.

11:42.920 --> 11:47.240
And then when we land it like now, they're upset because it's crap or it's not finished

11:47.240 --> 11:48.920
or there's something wrong with it.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.920
And then it's like, OK, well, what we'll do is we'll wait until it's ready.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.840
Oh, no, that's a setback.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.240
You should have landed it now when I asked you to.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.200
So move your entitlement and shove it somewhere else.

11:59.200 --> 12:05.880
I think where I kind of connect with it is that, well, once we finally switch over to

12:05.880 --> 12:07.440
X, that's going to be solved.

12:07.440 --> 12:10.920
Once we finally get to Y, that won't be a problem anymore.

12:10.920 --> 12:18.240
And where I felt like that came up a lot was Michael Dominic's recent tryout Linux series

12:18.240 --> 12:21.960
that he's really done for the last five weeks of Coda Radio, where he was trying out, you

12:21.960 --> 12:24.760
know, I'm going to create an app, I'm going to do this, I'm going to move over to Linux.

12:24.760 --> 12:25.760
And there's a lot of questions.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.440
It's like, yeah, yeah, I know that's a little weird right now.

12:27.440 --> 12:32.520
But when Unity 8 ships and there's an officially blessed sort of UI look that things are supposed

12:32.520 --> 12:37.280
to have and there's a clear path for distributing software and there's these snap packages to

12:37.280 --> 12:42.180
make it easy for you to be in control of updates for your user base, you're going to love it.

12:42.180 --> 12:46.740
And so there's all this pent-up anticipation for a payoff that we've all been waiting

12:46.740 --> 12:49.360
for now since Mir was announced.

12:49.360 --> 12:53.200
And so it's a setback in that, oh, we have to wait longer.

12:53.200 --> 12:54.200
That's how it's a setback.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.000
Yeah, you don't get your new toys right away.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.400
They're going to be available for testing, but they won't be available for general availability.

12:59.400 --> 13:03.280
And that's, if there's a setback, that's what it is, and I don't think it's a big deal.

13:03.280 --> 13:06.440
There was also at the UDS, I don't know, I didn't actually get a chance to watch it before

13:06.440 --> 13:11.520
the show, but Michael says that there was more talk about conversions apps, Ubuntu discourse

13:11.520 --> 13:16.920
closing unless Microsoft steps in, and handling legacy apps with Mir and Snappy.

13:16.920 --> 13:20.760
And in regards to Ubuntu Touch, it looks like there's consideration of skipping Cyanogen

13:20.760 --> 13:24.040
Mod 5 and going right to Cyanogen Mod 7.

13:24.040 --> 13:26.640
It's not necessarily there's anything in Android 6 everybody's excited about.

13:26.640 --> 13:30.360
It's more that there's things in Kernel 4.4 that everyone's excited about.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.360
Interesting.

13:31.360 --> 13:34.800
And I don't know, Pobi, if you have any information on this, this is the thing I'm the most interested

13:34.800 --> 13:39.360
in is I don't really understand the relationship between Canonical and UNAV, but it sounds

13:39.360 --> 13:45.440
like UNAV is going to be the way you get navigation under Ubuntu Touch, and there's more discussions.

13:45.440 --> 13:46.440
It already is.

13:46.440 --> 13:47.440
Right.

13:47.440 --> 13:48.440
It already is a default app on the phone.

13:48.440 --> 13:54.840
It's a community-maintained app, and we had a session where we discussed the future plans,

13:54.840 --> 14:00.440
and Nick Lesh and Marcos showed off some of the stuff they've got in development for the

14:00.440 --> 14:01.440
next release.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.440
Yeah, you sure did.

14:02.440 --> 14:03.440
There's your mug right there when I go to the UNAV.

14:03.440 --> 14:04.440
Yeah, sorry about that.

14:04.440 --> 14:05.440
Yeah, you look at that stash.

14:05.440 --> 14:11.040
You've got way too much facial hair on your face then, let me tell you.

14:11.040 --> 14:12.560
So anything of interest to know?

14:12.560 --> 14:15.960
Is there new developments coming with UNAV, or just better integration, what?

14:15.960 --> 14:17.240
I don't come here for my living shoes.

14:17.240 --> 14:20.560
I come here for advice on my facial hair.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.560
I know that.

14:21.560 --> 14:22.560
I know that.

14:22.560 --> 14:23.560
And your smell.

14:23.560 --> 14:24.560
You're doing good on that front.

14:24.560 --> 14:26.600
So what can you tell us about the UNAV stuff?

14:26.600 --> 14:30.780
Because as somebody who seriously would be considering Ubuntu Touch, good navigation

14:30.780 --> 14:33.520
is a pretty essential feature for me, especially somebody who likes to drive around.

14:33.520 --> 14:38.320
The stuff we were talking about for the next release was more to do with making the app

14:38.320 --> 14:44.160
work well on tablets and using the space well on a tablet, rather than just having one giant

14:44.160 --> 14:47.440
map and then when you click on something it takes over the whole screen.

14:47.440 --> 14:51.000
Having a split screen user interface where you have like a tab down the right hand side

14:51.000 --> 14:55.400
with your list of restaurants and then marks plotted on the left hand side showing the

14:55.400 --> 14:56.400
map.

14:56.400 --> 15:00.000
Kind of split screen like you've seen on some of our other applications, that kind of thing.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
It's early days.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
I'd like to try that.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.600
Yeah, I love doing nav on a tablet when I can.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.360
It's so much nicer than on the phone.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.360
All right.

15:07.360 --> 15:12.680
Well, before we get totally off of Ubuntu Mobile Touch and before we get into Mr. Skooky

15:12.680 --> 15:17.400
Sprite's HD Vive experience under Linux, something caught my attention.

15:17.400 --> 15:24.020
I don't know what this all means, but the title is Plasma Mobile, a new base system.

15:24.020 --> 15:29.520
At the last Academy, the Plasma team revealed their first prototype of a new Plasma Mobile.

15:29.520 --> 15:37.440
Now I know what you've all been thinking, finally, another rebuilt mobile platform based

15:37.440 --> 15:40.200
on Linux that nobody will use, finally.

15:40.200 --> 15:44.520
Well, Plasma Mobile is designed to work with any existing operating stack, so they're hoping

15:44.520 --> 15:48.140
since it works with any OS stack out there, you'll pick it up pretty quick.

15:48.140 --> 15:55.060
And so far, they've based on reference images that were based on Ubuntu Touch using an Android

15:55.060 --> 15:58.800
system inside an LXE container to make use of Android hardware abstraction layer.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.860
Their initial touch base was Ubuntu 15.04.

16:01.860 --> 16:04.440
Eventually their images started to diverge from Ubuntu Touch.

16:04.440 --> 16:09.640
For example, they upgraded the libhybris to an upstream version because libhybris or whatever

16:09.640 --> 16:13.800
it is, is too old for their context.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.980
They also got to a newer QT version.

16:15.980 --> 16:21.720
They upgraded Ubuntu 16.04 for the base, and they've integrated some neon packages.

16:21.720 --> 16:24.080
To simplify things further, they wanted to experiment to see if they could get their

16:24.080 --> 16:27.080
own operating system stack that can run on mobile devices.

16:27.080 --> 16:31.880
After they looked at their requirements, they have a base system of Cyanogen with ASOP-based

16:31.880 --> 16:39.100
Android or AOSP, and the Ubuntu neon system inside a Chirrut or container.

16:39.100 --> 16:46.960
So this is the new Plasma Mobile stack based on top of the hard work of Ubuntu Touch.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.940
Two things surprise me about this story.

16:48.940 --> 16:52.600
Number one, that they're sort of starting over again with their Plasma Mobile base.

16:52.600 --> 16:59.480
Number two is they're sort of unceremoniously using Ubuntu Touch, and I find that ironic

16:59.480 --> 17:06.280
because I just remember some of the biggest pushback came from the Plasma group about

17:06.280 --> 17:14.080
Canonical going off and doing their own thing, and here they are now using it as a base.

17:14.080 --> 17:15.280
You see in the irony there, Wes?

17:15.280 --> 17:17.040
I do see some irony there.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.200
And they're like, but we've totally diverged.

17:19.200 --> 17:24.200
We're no longer using Ubuntu base, well, except for 6.04 and neon packages.

17:24.200 --> 17:28.120
But other than that, we're no longer using Ubuntu as a base.

17:28.120 --> 17:29.120
I don't know.

17:29.120 --> 17:33.280
Maybe I'm being too hard, but that was just sort of the waft I got off this.

17:33.280 --> 17:36.700
Anybody in the Mumble Room have thoughts on this story?

17:36.700 --> 17:37.840
Another mobile platform, guys.

17:37.840 --> 17:42.560
Hey, I'd be curious to talk to someone who likes it, just tried it, but now it's new

17:42.560 --> 17:43.560
again.

17:43.560 --> 17:44.560
Can you hear the plane crash?

17:44.560 --> 17:45.560
Yeah.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.600
I just, I mean, I'm a fan of it.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.600
I'm a fan of, you know, people creating things with their passion.

17:49.600 --> 17:53.000
And it would be interesting if it was like, you know, on multiple types of devices and

17:53.000 --> 17:57.200
you could just be like, hey, I got a new device and the KDE mobile stuff works, Plasma mobile

17:57.200 --> 17:58.200
works great.

17:58.200 --> 18:02.640
Well, device isn't limited to you because that's the problem I have with so many mobile

18:02.640 --> 18:03.640
stuff coming up.

18:03.640 --> 18:07.800
It doesn't support like a simple tablet that I have, so I can't try it.

18:07.800 --> 18:11.720
Well, you know, being based on CyanogenLOD and AOSP.

18:11.720 --> 18:12.720
Hopefully that will help.

18:12.720 --> 18:13.720
Yeah.

18:13.720 --> 18:19.040
They're using LXC for the, you know, for Android, this is, LXC is very interesting, funny that

18:19.040 --> 18:21.040
we're going to be talking about that later today.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.040
Okay.

18:22.040 --> 18:26.400
So apparently not a lot, not a lot of comments, but they have proof of concept working on

18:26.400 --> 18:27.400
a Nexus device.

18:27.400 --> 18:31.360
So if you are curious about it, they do have it up and running.

18:31.360 --> 18:36.140
Using Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu TouchBase, and some of the Neon packages.

18:36.140 --> 18:37.520
They talk about moving quick, right?

18:37.520 --> 18:39.080
Talk about moving super quick.

18:39.080 --> 18:44.720
So a couple of weeks ago, we had a chance to talk about the HTC Vive.

18:44.720 --> 18:48.320
You know, that's the VR solution that has Valve's cooperation.

18:48.320 --> 18:52.080
The creators of SteamOS, you may remember them.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.080
Do you remember Valve?

18:53.080 --> 18:54.080
Oh, yeah.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.080
They make that Debian-based app.

18:55.080 --> 18:56.080
Yes, right.

18:56.080 --> 19:00.300
And so we all thought that if they were going to release a VR solution, theirs would have

19:00.300 --> 19:02.200
the best likelihood of supporting Linux.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.200
I mean, it's from Valve.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.760
Because you want to use it with your Steam machine.

19:04.760 --> 19:07.200
Their very own platform is SteamOS.

19:07.200 --> 19:11.560
So none of us were willing to put our money where our mouth was and actually try it.

19:11.560 --> 19:12.560
We're cheapskates.

19:12.560 --> 19:13.560
Yeah.

19:13.560 --> 19:14.560
We're just not crazy enough.

19:14.560 --> 19:16.800
But Mr. Skookiesprite did just that.

19:16.800 --> 19:23.320
He went out there, put his money where his mouth was, and got himself an HTC Vive, set

19:23.320 --> 19:26.600
it all up, connected it to his Linux box, and here's to report how it went.

19:26.600 --> 19:31.520
But first, before we get off mobile, let's talk about Ting, sponsor of the Linux Unplugged

19:31.520 --> 19:32.520
program.

19:32.520 --> 19:33.520
Linux.ting.com.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.520
Go there right now, won't you?

19:35.520 --> 19:36.520
Linux.ting.com.

19:36.520 --> 19:40.160
I tell you what I did, and I think this might be a great way for you to go.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.200
Get yourself a Nexus device from Google Play.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.200
Just do it.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.200
Don't play.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.200
Go get it from Play.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.200
You know what I'm saying?

19:46.200 --> 19:47.200
Don't think about it.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.200
Just order it.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.200
Here's why.

19:49.200 --> 19:56.880
If you're going to get yourself a mobile device, you know, I'm getting messages right now that

19:56.880 --> 19:57.880
are pretty funny.

19:57.880 --> 20:02.960
I love this Nexus 5 because I have been able to experiment with the heck out of this thing.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.840
And Ting is just like, oh, you want a mobile service provider?

20:04.840 --> 20:05.840
Yeah.

20:05.840 --> 20:06.840
It's smart in.

20:06.840 --> 20:07.840
It's mobile on demand.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.840
It's no contract.

20:08.840 --> 20:09.840
No other termination fee.

20:09.840 --> 20:10.840
You only pay for what you use.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.400
So I'm sitting here on Wi-Fi right now.

20:12.400 --> 20:16.120
I got Noah to set up a 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi network while he was here with his fancy Ubiquiti

20:16.120 --> 20:17.600
routers that he likes so much.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.600
I won't touch them.

20:18.600 --> 20:19.600
They're freedom hating.

20:19.600 --> 20:20.600
But he loves them.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.600
So he set up a 5 gigahertz network.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.520
I put the Nexus 5 on that, the 5X.

20:23.520 --> 20:28.840
I rolled back to Android M. Ting was honey badger about the entire process.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.400
They're totally cool.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.480
They have such a great service.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.640
And they have CDMA and GSM.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.360
So if you have a device that does both, you can pick and choose.

20:35.360 --> 20:39.360
If you have one that's compatible to the network, you can bring it over to Ting and get a $25

20:39.360 --> 20:40.360
service credit.

20:40.360 --> 20:42.600
I got three devices on my line.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.800
I'm paying like this.

20:43.800 --> 20:48.160
This is including Linux Fest, including the Linux Fest stuff, $40.

20:48.160 --> 20:49.160
That is impressive.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.160
Yeah.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.160
It's really great.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.160
Super nice dashboard.

20:52.160 --> 20:55.800
They have all kinds of devices from the Kyocera Dura, which starts at like $47.

20:55.800 --> 20:58.160
How do you even say that again, Chris?

20:58.160 --> 20:59.160
Kyocera Dura.

20:59.160 --> 21:00.160
Kyocera Dura.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.160
Yay.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.160
XT.

21:02.160 --> 21:05.440
Also, the LG 450 starts at $58.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.680
These are just really nice feature phones that have like a battery that lasts a week.

21:08.680 --> 21:11.320
You know, you just want a phone that lasts a week.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.880
Then they've got things like the LG Volt 2, $66.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.880
Motorola E, $74.

21:15.880 --> 21:18.800
Apple Internet Phone 4, $87.

21:18.800 --> 21:19.800
No contract.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.280
No early termination fee.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.760
You only pay for what you use.

21:22.760 --> 21:23.760
Unlocked.

21:23.760 --> 21:24.760
You own these devices.

21:24.760 --> 21:29.160
LG K7, just added to the Ting store, $143.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.360
Antutel One Touch IDOL 3, $178.

21:31.360 --> 21:34.440
Under $200 for a nice Android device.

21:34.440 --> 21:39.800
They go all the way up to the Samsung latest, the Motorola X, the Moto X.

21:39.800 --> 21:40.800
That's a nice phone.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.800
That is a nice phone.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.000
Internet Phone 5S, still a pretty good phone.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.640
Samsung's, the latest Samsung.

21:45.640 --> 21:47.200
Oh, what's that one right there?

21:47.200 --> 21:48.200
That 6P.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.200
Ooh.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.200
Look at that 6P.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.200
Yeah, totally.

21:51.200 --> 21:52.200
I know, right?

21:52.200 --> 21:53.600
They also just added the Galaxy S7.

21:53.600 --> 21:57.520
They've got all the great devices with no contract, no early termination fee, fanatically

21:57.520 --> 22:03.120
good customer support, unlimited devices on one account, no mysterious line items, no

22:03.120 --> 22:07.360
add-on charges, no contracts, no early termination fee.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.000
You just pay for what you use.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.400
You get started by going to linux.ting.com.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.400
Also check out their blog.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.520
They always have great app pics and stuff, and they're doing a giveaway of the Galaxy

22:15.520 --> 22:16.520
Note 5.

22:16.520 --> 22:17.520
Yeah.

22:17.520 --> 22:18.520
Linux.ting.com.

22:18.520 --> 22:22.640
Thank you, Ting, for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

22:22.640 --> 22:26.420
All right, Mr. Sprite, Mr. Skookie, Mr. Writer.

22:26.420 --> 22:29.360
Tell me about your experiences with HTC Vive.

22:29.360 --> 22:34.120
Do you mind telling us how much you spent, just sort of starting from there?

22:34.120 --> 22:39.120
How much you spent, how long the setup took, all of that?

22:39.120 --> 22:44.320
You know, Chris, I'm not sure you can see the incandescent rage that is fueling me at

22:44.320 --> 22:50.280
this moment, but those I've had interactions with in real life have been like, what's wrong

22:50.280 --> 22:51.280
with you?

22:51.280 --> 22:53.280
I'm like, it's the Vive!

22:53.280 --> 22:54.600
Okay, yeah.

22:54.600 --> 22:58.840
So my Vive arrived yesterday, took about two and a half hours to set up.

22:58.840 --> 22:59.840
Now hold on there.

22:59.840 --> 23:00.840
Hold on there.

23:00.840 --> 23:01.840
Two and a half hours.

23:01.840 --> 23:02.840
Wow.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.280
And it's not like Skookie Sprite is some slouch here.

23:04.280 --> 23:05.280
It's not like-

23:05.280 --> 23:06.280
Right, no.

23:06.280 --> 23:09.280
So what takes two and a half hours to set up about it?

23:09.280 --> 23:14.240
Okay, well, one of the great strengths, I think, about the Vive as a device is that

23:14.240 --> 23:18.160
it gives, quote unquote, full room virtual reality.

23:18.160 --> 23:23.880
So that means that you have to set up two base stations that are ideally positioned

23:23.880 --> 23:31.720
higher than you standing that have unimpeded line of sight between each other.

23:31.720 --> 23:37.100
And that means like either you're drilling stuff into walls or you're jury rigging, as

23:37.100 --> 23:39.680
I did, jury rigging a bunch of tripods and stuff.

23:39.680 --> 23:42.920
Right, that's how I would think you'd have to do is put them up on a bunch of tripods.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.480
Yeah, pretty much.

23:44.480 --> 23:49.740
And so that is, the cool thing is those don't have to actually be wired to the computer,

23:49.740 --> 23:54.760
but they do each have their own separate power adapters.

23:54.760 --> 23:57.960
So it was a challenge.

23:57.960 --> 24:02.320
And is this Windows only software to configure them?

24:02.320 --> 24:04.760
Like where do you start running the limitations here?

24:04.760 --> 24:10.480
Okay, so yesterday, I mean, I was so pumped, especially like, I was like, okay, this is

24:10.480 --> 24:11.480
great.

24:11.480 --> 24:14.760
Like I'll be able to have a whole week with this before I have to talk about it in the

24:14.760 --> 24:16.360
podcast, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

24:16.360 --> 24:21.000
And I cleared my entire afternoon, and so I started setting it up.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
And I'm just so pumped.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.920
I'm like, finally, because I mean, I had an Oculus SDK too, but long before they dropped

24:26.920 --> 24:30.120
support for it and blah, blah, blah.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.240
So I was super, super pumped about this.

24:32.240 --> 24:35.680
And I'm setting it up, and it's taking longer and longer.

24:35.680 --> 24:42.240
And I get it all set up, and the cables are just enormous, and it's a big, big nightmare.

24:42.240 --> 24:48.920
And that's when I realize, oh, wait, I haven't checked to see if this actually supports Linux

24:48.920 --> 24:51.040
because I'm having some problems.

24:51.040 --> 24:55.040
You know, getting the display to work correctly, and I'm like, oh, well, let's just go to the

24:55.040 --> 24:56.520
support site.

24:56.520 --> 25:01.080
And there's nothing for Linux.

25:01.080 --> 25:02.080
So then I'm like, okay, fine.

25:02.080 --> 25:06.800
I'll go to Steam VR, you know, because Steam VR, I mean, that's Valve, that's Steam.

25:06.800 --> 25:07.800
That's Steam OS.

25:07.800 --> 25:08.800
That's got to work.

25:08.800 --> 25:09.800
Linux.

25:09.800 --> 25:15.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's Windows only too now.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.840
So can you believe that?

25:17.840 --> 25:24.920
So not only do you have to have at least a decent modern graphics, you have to have a

25:24.920 --> 25:27.160
nice CPU.

25:27.160 --> 25:28.160
So what?

25:28.160 --> 25:32.640
I mean, realistically, you got to have a minimum $1,000 PC to run this thing, right?

25:32.640 --> 25:33.640
Well, yeah.

25:33.640 --> 25:34.640
Okay.

25:34.640 --> 25:40.320
So my pre-order or whatever, which I placed in like the eighth of the month, like two

25:40.320 --> 25:41.320
months ago.

25:41.320 --> 25:42.320
Yeah.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.200
So it took forever to get here.

25:44.200 --> 25:48.640
I think it was like 950 bucks all total.

25:48.640 --> 25:49.640
Not including the computer?

25:49.640 --> 25:50.640
No, of course not.

25:50.640 --> 25:51.640
Oh, right.

25:51.640 --> 25:52.640
Wow.

25:52.640 --> 25:53.640
Dude, are you kidding?

25:53.640 --> 25:57.640
I got like 28 terabytes in this here that I built.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.640
Yeah.

25:58.640 --> 25:59.640
Yeah.

25:59.640 --> 26:00.640
Yeah.

26:00.640 --> 26:01.640
This is a winner.

26:01.640 --> 26:02.640
This is a real winner.

26:02.640 --> 26:03.640
Well, no, here's the thing.

26:03.640 --> 26:08.140
Okay, so the Oculus doesn't include any control surfaces.

26:08.140 --> 26:15.240
This control, the Vive has these two really interesting, innovative little paddle sticks

26:15.240 --> 26:18.560
that you hold and they're actually really cool.

26:18.560 --> 26:23.640
It was very depressing when I had to pack it all up and file for a return yesterday

26:23.640 --> 26:25.720
after just deploying it.

26:25.720 --> 26:28.760
But Linux support, here's the bottom line.

26:28.760 --> 26:30.840
They say that Linux support is coming now.

26:30.840 --> 26:34.840
Meanwhile, they had promised Linux support from day one and they were very open about

26:34.840 --> 26:38.960
that in both their marketing and in their media campaign.

26:38.960 --> 26:43.160
And then they just rolled back on it on evidently the 22nd of last month after they shipped

26:43.160 --> 26:45.120
my unit.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.120
And I was the last person to hear about it.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.940
So that's a bummer.

26:48.940 --> 26:54.560
And do you feel like, I mean, Linux setup, Linux support aside, a two hour setup with

26:54.560 --> 26:58.080
this is an investment with these things you have to put up on tripods or mount to your

26:58.080 --> 26:59.080
wall.

26:59.080 --> 27:01.040
And this, are you kidding me?

27:01.040 --> 27:05.560
You know as well as I do that virtual reality is absolutely unbelievable.

27:05.560 --> 27:09.080
It's going to be the next transformative technology for the next three years.

27:09.080 --> 27:13.760
It's going to be a multi-billion dollar marketplace, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

27:13.760 --> 27:14.760
You're telling me.

27:14.760 --> 27:15.760
I don't know.

27:15.760 --> 27:16.760
I thought so.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.840
But then Wimpy started to convince me that virtual reality is a hoax and that you give

27:19.840 --> 27:22.440
me this story about a two hour setup.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.920
They don't even support their own platform.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.920
Forget the two hour setup.

27:25.920 --> 27:26.920
That's the big thing.

27:26.920 --> 27:31.760
Like the biggest thing that really depressed me about this and I, you know, because I had

27:31.760 --> 27:37.680
to do, I need some official quotes from HTC and Valve and so I was, you know, calling

27:37.680 --> 27:40.560
the PR people this morning.

27:40.560 --> 27:44.920
The most depressing thing to me is that it shows, first of all, even for getting Linux,

27:44.920 --> 27:49.840
it just shows like a total, I would not be confident in investing in this platform even

27:49.840 --> 27:54.280
if I didn't run Linux now because like, oh, well, you can't even, like you said, develop

27:54.280 --> 27:57.960
your own frigging platform, you know, wow, that's amazing.

27:57.960 --> 27:59.960
Wimpy, you must be listening to this.

27:59.960 --> 28:03.200
Do you hear this and think to yourself, this is exactly what you're saying.

28:03.200 --> 28:05.760
This is never going to be a consumer platform.

28:05.760 --> 28:08.840
Well, kind of.

28:08.840 --> 28:14.080
I mean, it's very early days at the moment, but certainly the barrier to entry in terms

28:14.080 --> 28:20.560
of the technology you need once you've got your bridle is expensive.

28:20.560 --> 28:22.800
Your bridle.

28:22.800 --> 28:28.480
Wimpy, have you ever actually sat down with any sort of virtual reality headset?

28:28.480 --> 28:29.480
I have.

28:29.480 --> 28:30.480
Okay, cool.

28:30.480 --> 28:31.480
So, all right, fine then.

28:31.480 --> 28:32.480
That's all I need to know.

28:32.480 --> 28:35.960
Then I will respectfully disagree with you.

28:35.960 --> 28:43.160
I've used three different generations of virtual reality headsets and other equipment and the

28:43.160 --> 28:48.960
graphics get better and nothing else about it is any more convincing or compelling than

28:48.960 --> 28:52.400
the very first iterations I saw in the 80s.

28:52.400 --> 28:58.440
You see, I totally disagree because I was there in the 90s and because I live in Vegas

28:58.440 --> 29:03.200
and we had the best arcades back then and we had some pretty compelling virtual reality

29:03.200 --> 29:09.600
stuff and so I wrote it all off until the Oculus Rift, which blew my mind.

29:09.600 --> 29:15.440
Like, awe for the awesome was just incredible, I thought.

29:15.440 --> 29:19.720
I think that eventually it will work for some games, but I think we're going to get a lot

29:19.720 --> 29:27.160
of rubbish games with rubbish implementations of VR and I've used 3D TV as an example of

29:27.160 --> 29:32.040
why VR isn't going to work and it's more to do with the fact that you have to have something

29:32.040 --> 29:36.760
on your head and this is worse than 3D TV because you have to have something on your

29:36.760 --> 29:39.680
head with a multitude of cables coming out of it.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.240
Yeah, that is problematic.

29:41.240 --> 29:45.680
Yeah, that's a big deal because it's not really virtual reality, you're just tethered to a

29:45.680 --> 29:46.960
computer somewhere.

29:46.960 --> 29:47.960
It's just ridiculous.

29:47.960 --> 29:53.080
There's a lot of issues that people, general consumers, just won't get over.

29:53.080 --> 29:57.080
They won't get over the cost, they won't get over the inconvenience and they won't get

29:57.080 --> 30:04.560
over the average implementation of games and more importantly, I think that the games are

30:04.560 --> 30:12.280
going to try and play to the VR capabilities in the same way you get 3D TVs for 3D.

30:12.280 --> 30:19.240
Yeah, totally, but by the same token, every new medium, especially in terms of the history

30:19.240 --> 30:25.840
of video games, has come with the same set of challenges and generally speaking, the

30:25.840 --> 30:30.400
new and better looking and more immersive technology has always won out, at least over

30:30.400 --> 30:34.400
the last 30 years in my opinion and I do agree, it's a big pain in the ass, but one of the

30:34.400 --> 30:40.880
cool things about the Vive that I really liked and was really hopeful about is this full

30:40.880 --> 30:47.080
scale, room scale virtual reality, like if you've seen the video of the chick using Google's

30:47.080 --> 30:54.660
tilt brush to paint in 3D, when you actually end up using that application with the Vive,

30:54.660 --> 31:00.560
it's really impressive except for the fact that it was on Windows so I packed it up and

31:00.560 --> 31:03.200
it's being returned.

31:03.200 --> 31:09.560
The reason for that is we all know how long that to-do list is when Linux support is on

31:09.560 --> 31:10.560
that to-do list.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.560
That to-do list never gets done.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.120
Those features never get implemented.

31:14.120 --> 31:19.680
Five years later, if you're lucky, they'll add Linux support and I, for one, I was comfortable

31:19.680 --> 31:25.240
paying my money, taking my chances with the Oculus SDK 2 because I wanted to develop for

31:25.240 --> 31:30.440
it specifically and I was like, okay, fine, Linux support is body whatever and then eventually

31:30.440 --> 31:33.160
six months later, they had the balls to come out and say, you know what, we're dropping

31:33.160 --> 31:34.160
this.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.480
We just want to do Windows stuff, which was okay.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.480
I paid my money.

31:37.480 --> 31:44.400
I totally, I totally bought, but these guys, these guys sold me this unit, not just like

31:44.400 --> 31:51.720
is rumored marketing, but one of the key selling points was this is being developed in, not

31:51.720 --> 31:59.860
just developed, but this is totally the partnership of Steam and Valve and HTC for Linux.

31:59.860 --> 32:02.520
Day one, Linux support, they dropped that.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.520
I mean, what?

32:03.520 --> 32:08.120
I'm going to wait two weeks until I can't return it and then find out six months later

32:08.120 --> 32:11.520
that they're not going to have Linux, you know, at all?

32:11.520 --> 32:13.960
I mean, cause I don't have time to play anything on Windows.

32:13.960 --> 32:18.920
I have to, I play 15 games a week for my podcast.

32:18.920 --> 32:22.920
So it's like, wow, you know, like I have no time for anything other than games that weren't

32:22.920 --> 32:23.920
on Linux.

32:23.920 --> 32:27.320
And the other thing that's depressing about it though is that I think this was a big moment

32:27.320 --> 32:34.120
for Linux from a hardware perspective to hit a general consumer market that actually has

32:34.120 --> 32:35.120
money.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.120
Video games are money.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.800
That's why Steam is such a big deal, you know, blah.

32:38.800 --> 32:45.120
It leverages the market share, makes FOSS and supporting free and open source products

32:45.120 --> 32:50.080
and hardware more important for, you know, graphics card manufacturers and stuff like

32:50.080 --> 32:51.080
that.

32:51.080 --> 32:52.080
And this is a big failure.

32:52.080 --> 32:58.120
When I see this too, I see it as a sort of a huge disappointment, but one that I, here's,

32:58.120 --> 33:00.840
here's where I'm going to get my temperature from, Skooky, and this is what I want to ask

33:00.840 --> 33:02.360
you.

33:02.360 --> 33:09.240
How much of the like configuring or aligning or calibrating or whatever you want to call

33:09.240 --> 33:14.080
it, how much of the setup of the devices requires like a Windows application?

33:14.080 --> 33:16.880
How much is...

33:16.880 --> 33:17.880
Basically all of it.

33:17.880 --> 33:18.880
You can't...

33:18.880 --> 33:20.120
So they're going to have to recreate all of that.

33:20.120 --> 33:23.720
They would theoretically have to redo all of that as Linux software to set this up.

33:23.720 --> 33:24.880
Well, hang on a second.

33:24.880 --> 33:28.760
The thing is, and they've been saying this for two years almost that they're, they were

33:28.760 --> 33:30.640
going to hit the street.

33:30.640 --> 33:33.120
It's not that they canceled Linux support.

33:33.120 --> 33:37.640
It's just that now it's on the to do list and they decide to do that, you know, two

33:37.640 --> 33:40.680
weeks ago, you know, after they've been shipping units to people.

33:40.680 --> 33:47.840
So it's, it's theoretically, it's still coming, but no, and I've, it's, it's almost impossible

33:47.840 --> 33:53.880
to, you need either HTC to, and I think it's legally complex for them.

33:53.880 --> 33:58.400
I haven't gotten an official quote from them just yet, but I should at four o'clock this

33:58.400 --> 33:59.400
afternoon.

33:59.400 --> 34:03.240
Anyway, it's legally complicated for that, for them because of the, their partnership

34:03.240 --> 34:08.840
with Steam and Valve, it's legally complicated for them to release their own Linux drivers

34:08.840 --> 34:12.080
because they're like kind of tied at the hip is my understanding.

34:12.080 --> 34:13.080
Makes me sad.

34:13.080 --> 34:19.200
If Steam VR can't run Linux, then, you know, HTC Vive can't run Linux, which doesn't make

34:19.200 --> 34:24.000
any sense to me because Steam VR is supposed to be built inside of Steam OS and that's

34:24.000 --> 34:25.000
supposed to be.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.720
I hate it when Wimpy's right, but right now Wimpy's right.

34:28.720 --> 34:29.720
So yeah.

34:29.720 --> 34:30.720
Okay.

34:30.720 --> 34:31.720
All right.

34:31.720 --> 34:35.320
So your closing thoughts, Mr. Wimpy.

34:35.320 --> 34:37.840
I told you so.

34:37.840 --> 34:38.840
Well said.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.360
Oh, hold on guys.

34:40.360 --> 34:43.320
The weaponized lawnmower is on its way back.

34:43.320 --> 34:46.440
Well, Skookie, thank you for giving it a shot and letting us know how it went.

34:46.440 --> 34:49.720
If people want to find your podcast where you talk about Linux gaming, where would they

34:49.720 --> 34:51.240
find it?

34:51.240 --> 34:52.240
Bestlinuxgames.com.

34:52.240 --> 34:53.240
Hey-o!

34:53.240 --> 34:57.000
And if you want to stick around towards the end, I wouldn't mind at the end of the show,

34:57.000 --> 34:58.480
maybe we could talk a little Tomb Raider.

34:58.480 --> 34:59.480
Oh, cool.

34:59.480 --> 35:00.480
Oh, yes.

35:00.480 --> 35:01.480
It's awesome.

35:01.480 --> 35:04.680
New Tomb Raider came out for Linux and I want to give you my thoughts on it.

35:04.680 --> 35:11.040
Before we jump into more stuff, I did want to mention briefly that OpenWRT got forked

35:11.040 --> 35:16.040
by some of its own developers, which is always actually, I think, kind of a good thing in

35:16.040 --> 35:17.040
a way.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.360
It means drama, but it also means the people with the new project...

35:19.360 --> 35:20.360
There's a passion there.

35:20.360 --> 35:21.360
Exactly.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.400
And they're calling it LEDE.

35:23.400 --> 35:26.240
It appears to be a move by new project leaders.

35:26.240 --> 35:29.120
It's a group of OpenWRT developers announced LEDE.

35:29.120 --> 35:34.640
Their fork of the project consists of a spin-off of OpenWRT with many of the same goals.

35:34.640 --> 35:38.280
It's, by the way, LEDE, short for Linux Embedded Development Environment.

35:38.280 --> 35:39.280
Brilliant, really.

35:39.280 --> 35:43.840
It will continue to focus on being a great embedded Linux distribution with a predictable

35:43.840 --> 35:45.800
release cycle and transparent decision-making.

35:45.800 --> 35:46.800
Hmm.

35:46.800 --> 35:49.520
I think that could go a long way.

35:49.520 --> 35:53.000
That's really one of the big limitations in that community right now, I think, is there's

35:53.000 --> 35:55.960
a lot of... Especially on the DDWRT side, there's a lot of things that are up in the

35:55.960 --> 35:59.200
air or a lot of you get your information from a forum post.

35:59.200 --> 36:02.820
And they say, look, we just looked at doing this because the core developer count was

36:02.820 --> 36:07.040
super low, unreliable infrastructure, and there was a lack of communication.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.040
No hard feelings?

36:08.040 --> 36:11.800
I mean, it sounds like maybe some, but I mean, it doesn't sound like it's a big dramatic

36:11.800 --> 36:12.800
thing.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.800
So LEDE, recently announced.

36:14.800 --> 36:15.800
You can find out more.

36:15.800 --> 36:19.520
We'll have a link in the show notes if you guys want to check that out.

36:19.520 --> 36:25.640
Now, a question came in that struck me yesterday that I thought, well, let's just briefly touch

36:25.640 --> 36:27.080
on it in the show.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.080
Yeah.

36:28.080 --> 36:33.520
XMittal points out we have LEDE, LXDE, LXLE, and LXQT.

36:33.520 --> 36:38.880
And don't forget, later today, we're going to talk about LXCE, or LXC, right, LXCE, and

36:38.880 --> 36:39.880
LXD.

36:39.880 --> 36:43.040
Uh-oh, weaponized lawnmower is back.

36:43.040 --> 36:44.040
Do you hear it?

36:44.040 --> 36:45.040
Do you hear it?

36:45.040 --> 36:46.040
Weaponized lawnmower.

36:46.040 --> 36:53.600
Okay, so Tetra wrote into the show and wanted to know about our power management solutions.

36:53.600 --> 36:59.160
And the reason why this struck me, Wes, it struck me deep, the reason why it struck me

36:59.160 --> 37:04.240
deep and hard was because it turned out to be the first bit of feedback I read right

37:04.240 --> 37:05.320
after my battery died.

37:05.320 --> 37:06.320
My battery died.

37:06.320 --> 37:07.320
Oh, boy.

37:07.320 --> 37:08.680
I couldn't work for like two hours.

37:08.680 --> 37:13.680
I got plugged back in, and I go to read this, and that's the question is, what's your power

37:13.680 --> 37:14.680
management strategy?

37:14.680 --> 37:18.000
And I thought, well, how freaking... What is it?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.000
What is it called?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.000
Serendipitous?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
Yeah, there you go.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
What's it called?

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
Serendipitous?

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Serendipitous.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.080
The reason why I read this is that my battery dies, and I open up my laptop, I go to get

37:26.080 --> 37:27.080
working again, and this is what I see.

37:27.080 --> 37:28.080
Clearly, you need a better solution.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.080
Yes, sir.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.080
There you go.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.080
Right there, Wes.

37:31.080 --> 37:32.680
So we're going to talk about that here on the show in just a moment.

37:32.680 --> 37:35.880
I want to find out what our virtual lug does, maybe what the chat room does.

37:35.880 --> 37:39.600
But first, I'm going to tell you what I do, and that is DigitalOcean.

37:39.600 --> 37:43.840
Head over to DigitalOcean.com and use our special promo code, DOUNPLUG.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.040
I love that promo code.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.040
All one word, Wes.

37:46.040 --> 37:47.040
It's lowercase.

37:47.040 --> 37:48.040
Just put it together.

37:48.040 --> 37:49.040
DOUNPLUG gives you a $10 credit.

37:49.040 --> 37:52.840
Now, DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering you the most

37:52.840 --> 37:56.600
intuitive way for you to get a super badass rig in the cloud in no time.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.360
Less than 55 seconds, you'll have the machine spun up.

37:58.360 --> 38:02.440
And if you only want to spend $5 a month, DigitalOcean's got you covered with 512 megabytes

38:02.440 --> 38:07.120
of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

38:07.120 --> 38:13.800
Now, we've been using DigitalOcean Droplets as our go-to Linux infrastructure on demand.

38:13.800 --> 38:14.800
We need a system.

38:14.800 --> 38:15.800
We just go to DigitalOcean now.

38:15.800 --> 38:16.800
Pin it up.

38:16.800 --> 38:20.320
It took a long time to increase our infrastructure for Linux Fest Northwest to make it possible

38:20.320 --> 38:21.320
to do what we needed to do.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.720
DigitalOcean, it was a no-brainer.

38:23.720 --> 38:27.240
And I'll be honest with you, one of the things I've done to make my management a little easier

38:27.240 --> 38:31.200
is I've added Noah's SSH key to my DigitalOcean profile.

38:31.200 --> 38:35.560
So now, when I want to collaborate on a Droplet with Noah, I can just add his key as a checkbox

38:35.560 --> 38:40.200
to any Droplet I'm creating, add my key, and I can add Rekai's key, boom, boom, boom.

38:40.200 --> 38:42.800
Now we all have SSH login to the new Droplet I've created.

38:42.800 --> 38:45.160
There's so many nice things about the DigitalOcean UI.

38:45.160 --> 38:46.280
You should totally check it out.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.280
They also have a great API.

38:47.280 --> 38:52.280
If you want to take advantage of some OSS code built around that API or you want to

38:52.280 --> 38:54.960
write some yourself, they have a really nice interface.

38:54.960 --> 39:00.800
But on top of that, they got locations, New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

39:00.800 --> 39:04.120
London, Toronto, Germany, all up in that business.

39:04.120 --> 39:08.440
Go get yourself a super fast, super fast Droplet.

39:08.440 --> 39:11.000
And they start at $5 a month and they got Ubuntu.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
They got Debian.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
They have Fedora.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
They have CentOS, CoreOS.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.000
And then you look at those hourly pricing, oh man.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
That is really slick.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.240
You can get a nice rig for like a couple hours and it pays very low.

39:20.240 --> 39:23.220
You want to do something for a little while, no big deal.

39:23.220 --> 39:26.760
If you have a horribly slow connection like I do at home, sometimes I'll spin up a DigitalOcean

39:26.760 --> 39:30.460
Droplet to download my distro of choice over Torrent and then I'll just suck it down over

39:30.460 --> 39:31.580
Wget later on.

39:31.580 --> 39:33.640
Last night it was like 80 degrees in Seattle.

39:33.640 --> 39:37.560
I didn't want my fan to kick on, but I wanted to compile a kernel, boom, DigitalOcean will

39:37.560 --> 39:38.560
do it for you.

39:38.560 --> 39:39.560
Seriously, it's nice.

39:39.560 --> 39:46.120
Also, they have one-click deployments of software just ready to go and they have fantastic,

39:46.120 --> 39:50.920
fantastic documentation, probably one that we've almost taken for granted.

39:50.920 --> 39:54.840
How to install the LAMP stack, Apache MySQL, PHP on Ubuntu 16.04.

39:54.840 --> 40:02.640
How to install NGINX, MySQL and PHP, the LIMP stack, LEMP, LIMP stack, which is NGINX on

40:02.640 --> 40:03.920
Ubuntu.

40:03.920 --> 40:06.200
How to install WordPress on Ubuntu.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.880
What's new in Ubuntu in 16.04.

40:08.880 --> 40:11.480
How to use NGINX and Let's Encrypt together.

40:11.480 --> 40:14.440
An introduction to configuration management.

40:14.440 --> 40:17.280
You can go from zero to like Linux Admin Hero on DigitalOcean.

40:17.280 --> 40:20.800
Or you know what, it's not just Linux, it's also FreeBSD too.

40:20.800 --> 40:23.520
I know, that's one of their more trickier things.

40:23.520 --> 40:26.760
They also have extremely good documentation on FreeBSD.

40:26.760 --> 40:30.960
But all the different distros, I mean everything they support, it's a really great, great service.

40:30.960 --> 40:36.440
And you can use our promo code DOUNPLUCT to get a $10 credit, try out their $5 rig, two

40:36.440 --> 40:38.760
months for free at DigitalOcean.com.

40:38.760 --> 40:42.360
Big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

40:42.360 --> 40:45.880
Okay Wes, I've talked about Subsonic before.

40:45.880 --> 40:50.160
In fact, Subsonic, when people would come to me and they'd say, hey Chris, what are

40:50.160 --> 40:51.800
you doing for media streaming?

40:51.800 --> 40:55.800
Hey Chris, what are you doing to listen to those sweet tunes?

40:55.800 --> 40:57.200
Yeah, exactly.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.840
Or what are you doing for podcast management?

40:59.840 --> 41:02.280
And this was a big one, and man did I love it, dude.

41:02.280 --> 41:06.240
I would have Subsonic centrally download my podcast and then I would listen to them and

41:06.240 --> 41:13.200
oh man, Subsonic was a great way to essentially set up Plex for your audio.

41:13.200 --> 41:17.440
And I had it installed, loved it, used the web UI, used all the different apps built

41:17.440 --> 41:18.440
off of it.

41:18.440 --> 41:24.880
Well, we have a little breaking news right here on the Unplugged program.

41:24.880 --> 41:27.040
Subsonic is going closed source.

41:27.040 --> 41:30.580
Starting with 6.0, Subsonic will no longer be open source.

41:30.580 --> 41:34.840
The main reason, according to one of the developers, is that the source code now contains software

41:34.840 --> 41:40.520
license codes that they purchased, literally what they said.

41:40.520 --> 41:46.240
Software license codes that I have purchased that shouldn't be used by Fork Projects.

41:46.240 --> 41:51.660
Now Subsonic West is one of these projects that has sort of been slowly moving towards

41:51.660 --> 41:53.680
this position for a while.

41:53.680 --> 41:57.200
It's one of these things that if you've been following the project, you kind of suspected

41:57.200 --> 41:58.200
this was coming.

41:58.200 --> 42:00.840
And it does happen from time to time in open source.

42:00.840 --> 42:05.320
And a couple of first reactions come to me like, well, who the hell are you?

42:05.320 --> 42:06.320
How dare you?

42:06.320 --> 42:07.320
Right?

42:07.320 --> 42:08.320
Of course, they're the developers and creators.

42:08.320 --> 42:09.320
They get to do whatever they like.

42:09.320 --> 42:11.020
Yeah, that's exactly who the hell they are.

42:11.020 --> 42:12.640
And then my other reaction is, well, screw you.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.280
I'll go find something else, right?

42:14.280 --> 42:15.840
Forking Subsonic by.

42:15.840 --> 42:16.840
Yeah.

42:16.840 --> 42:20.160
Anybody in the Mamba Room a Subsonic user before I move on from that?

42:20.160 --> 42:21.560
Because I think that's kind of a big deal.

42:21.560 --> 42:24.400
If you've been dependent on this open source project, it's been around for years and years,

42:24.400 --> 42:26.640
all of a sudden, closed source.

42:26.640 --> 42:27.640
Yeah.

42:27.640 --> 42:28.640
It sucks.

42:28.640 --> 42:34.640
I understand like with the complexities, especially like the licensing open source and keeping

42:34.640 --> 42:38.520
things free and open source is more difficult now than it's ever been.

42:38.520 --> 42:43.800
Keeping straight all the licenses of the stuff that you actually use to assemble your product.

42:43.800 --> 42:48.440
Anyway, Subsonic looked heavy handed to me anyway, but it still sucks.

42:48.440 --> 42:49.440
It was efficacious.

42:49.440 --> 42:50.440
Yeah.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.920
Now, Wimpy, you're a Subsonics user and donator.

42:52.920 --> 42:54.520
Tell me about Subsonics.

42:54.520 --> 42:59.720
Well, there are several tools like this, but I've had good success with Subsonic over the

42:59.720 --> 43:00.720
years.

43:00.720 --> 43:05.840
And once you start building up your library, I've got not a DigitalOcean droplet, but a

43:05.840 --> 43:11.520
VPS somewhere that runs my Subsonic stuff and it acts as offsite backup for our music.

43:11.520 --> 43:16.540
And it's my on the internet streaming service.

43:16.540 --> 43:21.960
So Subsonics is, is it a fork of Subsonic?

43:21.960 --> 43:24.120
No, sorry.

43:24.120 --> 43:30.000
Subsonic is what I'm using at the moment and yeah, and I understand there are forks of

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
Subsonics that I haven't used.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.880
And I've got a couple of that I'll talk about.

43:32.880 --> 43:38.880
So you, you are using the project that has now gone closed source in the new version?

43:38.880 --> 43:41.720
No, I haven't upgraded to the new version.

43:41.720 --> 43:42.720
And how do you feel about this?

43:42.720 --> 43:46.360
I mean, this is something, the only reason I ask you is because, you know, as longtime

43:46.360 --> 43:49.080
Linux users, from time to time this happens.

43:49.080 --> 43:53.640
Do you just roll with the punches when something like this happens or are you outraged and

43:53.640 --> 43:56.880
ready to take to the streets with pitchforks and a fire?

43:56.880 --> 43:58.360
I'm not outraged.

43:58.360 --> 44:02.760
I'm a little bit disappointed because I thought the reason that I was donating to this project

44:02.760 --> 44:08.880
was in order to keep it open source and now I've ended up funding a proprietary project.

44:08.880 --> 44:11.760
So I'm not super enthusiastic about that.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.240
This is my complaint right here.

44:13.240 --> 44:15.000
You just, yeah.

44:15.000 --> 44:20.080
I will be looking elsewhere in due course.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.560
What about if it's just remains free?

44:21.560 --> 44:25.840
Is that all it really takes, as long as it stays free, then you're good?

44:25.840 --> 44:28.280
I'm talking free as in freedom, not free as in beer.

44:28.280 --> 44:33.200
I have no problem paying for any, anything, like, you know, a service, you know, or like

44:33.200 --> 44:41.120
a podcast, like, you know, like Unfilter or whatever, or NPR, or any sort of software

44:41.120 --> 44:46.280
solution that's, you know, efficacious, I have no problem paying for it so long as it's

44:46.280 --> 44:47.280
free.

44:47.280 --> 44:50.240
I mean, it has to be, you know, free as in freedom, not free as in beer.

44:50.240 --> 44:54.920
Trevor Burrus So like Wimpy just touched on, there are several

44:54.920 --> 44:55.920
alternatives.

44:55.920 --> 45:01.800
Now, Subsonic kind of, it gives you a centralized on your land Spotify using your own library

45:01.800 --> 45:02.800
if you will.

45:02.800 --> 45:05.680
It also, it works with multiple media formats.

45:05.680 --> 45:07.040
It could also do some transcoding.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.880
It is in a lot of ways a lot like Plex too.

45:08.880 --> 45:13.160
It could go out and get metadata information, centralized playlists.

45:13.160 --> 45:19.560
So in that sort of same vein, Madsonic is one that I've heard a lot.

45:19.560 --> 45:22.600
Madsonic is a web-based media streamer.

45:22.600 --> 45:24.760
It's a fork of Subsonic.

45:24.760 --> 45:26.640
It is based on some Java.

45:26.640 --> 45:28.840
It runs on Linux.

45:28.840 --> 45:31.640
And one of the nice things about it, if you have constrained bandwidth, you can set upper

45:31.640 --> 45:35.080
limits on the music and it can re-encode some of the music for you if you want to stream,

45:35.080 --> 45:36.080
which is kind of nice.

45:36.080 --> 45:37.320
Matthew Feeney That is very nice, especially on, you know,

45:37.320 --> 45:38.320
you're on the bus or whatever.

45:38.320 --> 45:39.460
Trevor Burrus Yeah.

45:39.460 --> 45:42.120
And it's supposed to be easy to use.

45:42.120 --> 45:45.520
If you have, you know, 100,000 files in your music library, you're not going to have any

45:45.520 --> 45:46.520
problems.

45:46.520 --> 45:47.780
It's GPLed.

45:47.780 --> 45:51.000
And so that's, this is madsonic.org.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.280
You can find it at beta.madsonic.org.

45:53.280 --> 45:55.520
But you know, Wes, I'm going to tell you about the one that kind of caught my attention.

45:55.520 --> 45:58.080
The one that I kind of liked was Cherry Music.

45:58.080 --> 45:59.080
Matthew Feeney Ooh.

45:59.080 --> 46:00.080
Trevor Burrus Yeah, same thing.

46:00.080 --> 46:01.080
Matthew Feeney That's pretty cherry.

46:01.080 --> 46:05.040
Trevor Burrus GPL, easy to set up, get a go, blazingly fast

46:05.040 --> 46:06.040
search.

46:06.040 --> 46:07.040
Yep.

46:07.040 --> 46:08.040
They've got apps that work with it.

46:08.040 --> 46:10.040
It'll automatically go get the cover art.

46:10.040 --> 46:11.640
Super quick setup, which I think is really nice.

46:11.640 --> 46:13.200
Matthew Feeney I might stand this up pretty soon here.

46:13.200 --> 46:14.200
That looks awesome.

46:14.200 --> 46:15.200
Trevor Burrus Yeah, it does.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.200
Here, I'll show you a few screenshots.

46:16.200 --> 46:18.960
This is Cherry Music, kind of the same deal.

46:18.960 --> 46:22.280
For those of you that are familiar with Subsonic, the functionality will look familiar.

46:22.280 --> 46:23.280
Oh, the screen.

46:23.280 --> 46:24.720
Oh, there it goes.

46:24.720 --> 46:27.640
But the UI is a little nicer.

46:27.640 --> 46:31.400
So this is a really easy way to have like, if you want to have a bunch of your audio

46:31.400 --> 46:36.920
music on a central file server, but then have everyone have the same playlist throughout

46:36.920 --> 46:37.920
the house.

46:37.920 --> 46:41.960
This was always a problem that Angela and I had is we had the same music library a lot

46:41.960 --> 46:45.560
of the time where she'd have like, well actually for a long time she had her own library, I

46:45.560 --> 46:48.120
had my own library, we had our own playlists and all this.

46:48.120 --> 46:50.560
And then we wanted to like, well, we're going to have people over, let's have a playlist

46:50.560 --> 46:51.880
that plays in the living room.

46:51.880 --> 46:54.920
Okay, well whose computer did you know, and it was just like, oh, do you want to bring

46:54.920 --> 46:55.920
it up?

46:55.920 --> 46:56.920
Matthew Feeney Now you're choosing between them and switching.

46:56.920 --> 46:57.960
Trevor Burrus Yeah, and so then all the energy and effort

46:57.960 --> 46:58.960
goes into one spot.

46:58.960 --> 47:03.120
And that's why we set up Subsonic and we're able to have like party mix playlists and

47:03.120 --> 47:07.080
like Christmas playlists and she could go set it up on the thing and then I would just

47:07.080 --> 47:08.080
play it.

47:08.080 --> 47:09.080
Matthew Feeney That's awesome.

47:09.080 --> 47:10.080
Trevor Burrus It was a very nice setup.

47:10.080 --> 47:13.160
Plus, you're taking advantage of the centralized network storage at that point and you're just

47:13.160 --> 47:14.560
throwing this on top of it.

47:14.560 --> 47:18.280
So Cherry Music, which I like a lot, the URL is a little weird, so I'll just, you'll have

47:18.280 --> 47:21.840
to go find the link in the show notes, but I like that one.

47:21.840 --> 47:22.840
Amachi?

47:22.840 --> 47:23.840
Apanchi?

47:23.840 --> 47:24.840
Inagogo says it's…

47:24.840 --> 47:25.840
Matthew Feeney Ampachi?

47:25.840 --> 47:26.840
Trevor Burrus Ampachi.

47:26.840 --> 47:27.840
Ampachi.org.

47:27.840 --> 47:28.840
A-M-P-A-C-H-E.org.

47:28.840 --> 47:35.240
And also, it looks like Rekai is recommending Syrenza, which is another one there.

47:35.240 --> 47:36.240
Boy, there's a few of these.

47:36.240 --> 47:40.000
Cherry Music is the one I picked, but it looks like if you're in the chat room, you could

47:40.000 --> 47:43.640
totally score some links for a couple other alternatives as well.

47:43.640 --> 47:44.640
I'm going through all of them right now.

47:44.640 --> 47:46.600
There's a whole bunch in here.

47:46.600 --> 47:47.600
I like that one.

47:47.600 --> 47:54.000
You know, I should also mention, like Grandell is mentioning in the chat room, Plex is aggressively

47:54.000 --> 47:55.480
going after this category too.

47:55.480 --> 47:58.240
Plex is aggressively going after music.

47:58.240 --> 47:59.240
So this is another…

47:59.240 --> 48:00.240
Matthew Feeney I was about to say, yeah.

48:00.240 --> 48:02.960
Trevor Burrus This is bad timing on Subsonics' part because

48:02.960 --> 48:04.400
Plex is attempting to go this way too.

48:04.400 --> 48:06.320
Matthew Feeney And so many people have Plex at their house

48:06.320 --> 48:07.320
already.

48:07.320 --> 48:08.320
Trevor Burrus Well, Syrenza looks nice.

48:08.320 --> 48:09.320
This looks really nice, Rekai.

48:09.320 --> 48:10.320
Good find.

48:10.320 --> 48:11.320
That does look like a good one.

48:11.320 --> 48:12.320
And Ampachi.

48:12.320 --> 48:13.320
Ampachi.org.

48:13.320 --> 48:14.320
Ampachi or whatever.

48:14.320 --> 48:15.320
It looks really good too.

48:15.320 --> 48:16.320
Ooh, visualizers, Wes.

48:16.320 --> 48:17.320
Look at that.

48:17.320 --> 48:18.320
Hey, what's up?

48:18.320 --> 48:19.320
What's up?

48:19.320 --> 48:20.320
You get those visualizers.

48:20.320 --> 48:21.320
Yeah.

48:21.320 --> 48:28.320
So I guess I wanted to end just a quick note on…

48:28.320 --> 48:29.320
I don't know about you.

48:29.320 --> 48:30.320
You know what?

48:30.320 --> 48:34.040
I'll ask Wimpy because Wimpy has actually donated money.

48:34.040 --> 48:35.040
So let's ask Wimpy.

48:35.040 --> 48:37.560
Wimpy, did you have a sense this was coming?

48:37.560 --> 48:40.180
Because I'll be honest, I had a sense this was coming.

48:40.180 --> 48:45.800
Watching the Subsonic project, I had a feeling they were going this direction.

48:45.800 --> 48:49.960
Did you have that same feeling even as a donator?

48:49.960 --> 48:50.960
What was it?

48:50.960 --> 48:53.360
What was it that sort of set off your spider sense, if you will?

48:53.360 --> 48:56.320
Matthew Feeney It's the fact that when you install it, you

48:56.320 --> 49:01.760
have to put a license in to use it fully.

49:01.760 --> 49:09.800
It sort of very heavily influences you to donate in order to get a key.

49:09.800 --> 49:17.880
To use the product completely and it nags you and it felt like it was going this route.

49:17.880 --> 49:27.460
Some of the wording on the website sounded a bit plaintive about not getting the appropriate

49:27.460 --> 49:31.360
donations for the number of people using it and I just sort of got a sense that it was

49:31.360 --> 49:32.800
on its way.

49:32.800 --> 49:34.480
So yeah, I'm not surprised.

49:34.480 --> 49:41.360
I also am a Plex subscriber as well, but in my opinion, Plex isn't really there for music

49:41.360 --> 49:42.720
playback just yet.

49:42.720 --> 49:49.760
It's improved significantly in the last year or so, but it is not a good music manager

49:49.760 --> 49:53.280
and playlist organizer and player at all.

49:53.280 --> 49:55.160
Aaron Powell I agree.

49:55.160 --> 49:56.920
That's essentially my assessment of it too.

49:56.920 --> 50:02.360
So before we move, I did want to mention just really briefly the power management strategies.

50:02.360 --> 50:08.360
Is it still a thing in 2016 to go through a bunch of hoops to set up the perfect power

50:08.360 --> 50:10.200
management?

50:10.200 --> 50:15.040
And I ask you as someone who has sort of taken a backseat to this recently, I don't bother

50:15.040 --> 50:17.760
doing things like installing and configuring TLP.

50:17.760 --> 50:23.320
I don't really consider watching Power Top to see what's eating up all of my battery.

50:23.320 --> 50:29.480
I just assume that in 2016 I can install a modern operating system and not have to worry

50:29.480 --> 50:32.060
about power management.

50:32.060 --> 50:33.060
But maybe I'm wrong.

50:33.060 --> 50:34.060
And I'll start Wimpy with you.

50:34.060 --> 50:37.440
It sounds like you still think TLP is worth loading on if you have a laptop, correct?

50:37.440 --> 50:38.920
Wimpy Wimpy Yep.

50:38.920 --> 50:42.760
It's installed by default in Ubuntu Mate, has been for several releases now.

50:42.760 --> 50:44.800
Aaron Powell Now, what do you notice the difference?

50:44.800 --> 50:47.320
I mean, it must be a huge difference to make it default.

50:47.320 --> 50:50.480
Wimpy Wimpy Personally, I've noticed a significant difference

50:50.480 --> 50:51.760
in the power savings.

50:51.760 --> 50:57.280
That combined with managing your screen brightness appropriately because that can make a big difference.

50:57.280 --> 51:04.200
But there was another podcaster recently installed Ubuntu Mate on their main laptop.

51:04.200 --> 51:09.760
I won't say what distribution they replaced, but they were quoting a two-hour battery life

51:09.760 --> 51:13.200
improvement as a result of installing Ubuntu Mate.

51:13.200 --> 51:16.760
And the only significant difference there is that it comes pre-installed with TLP.

51:16.760 --> 51:22.280
And on some of my older computers, I can definitely measure the improvement in hours rather than

51:22.280 --> 51:23.280
minutes.

51:23.280 --> 51:27.280
Aaron Powell Hmm, Skookie, you said yes, definitely, if you're

51:27.280 --> 51:28.280
using Arch.

51:28.280 --> 51:29.280
Why do you say that?

51:29.280 --> 51:31.200
Wimpy Wimpy Oh, well, okay.

51:31.200 --> 51:35.440
So about three years ago, and I don't know if you remember this, but I got a Galaga Ultra

51:35.440 --> 51:37.800
Pro from System76.

51:37.800 --> 51:41.880
And I slapped Integra, I still run Arch on that.

51:41.880 --> 51:43.040
It's great.

51:43.040 --> 51:44.040
It's awesome.

51:44.040 --> 51:50.720
But in order to get anything other than like, literally, basic, basic, I mean, we're talking

51:50.720 --> 51:57.360
like, I would get like an hour and 15 minutes out of the battery until you had to go through

51:57.360 --> 52:04.640
the whole Arch horrific documentation, you know, that whole hour and a half long wall

52:04.640 --> 52:07.560
of text to configure everything appropriately.

52:07.560 --> 52:11.360
But now, you know, like I get, you know, four and a half hours.

52:11.360 --> 52:13.520
It's an older laptop, but it's still awesome.

52:13.520 --> 52:16.340
Aaron Powell Okay, Popey, I'm turning to you because I'm

52:16.340 --> 52:17.600
hoping you're going to tell me.

52:17.600 --> 52:18.840
I do nothing.

52:18.840 --> 52:23.800
I install Ubuntu, and I use it like a regular user and I get great battery life.

52:23.800 --> 52:24.800
Is that true?

52:24.800 --> 52:26.760
Or does Popey jump through hoops to get good battery life?

52:26.760 --> 52:31.160
Wimpy Wimpy So I recently had to reinstall on my new laptop.

52:31.160 --> 52:36.360
And I just installed it and I didn't do anything at all.

52:36.360 --> 52:42.360
However, I have somewhat worked around the issue, because my laptop has two batteries,

52:42.360 --> 52:45.880
one internal and one external, and I bought a second battery.

52:45.880 --> 52:52.280
So in the event that my power dies, I can just swap out the battery while I'm running

52:52.280 --> 52:53.280
and not have a problem.

52:53.280 --> 52:54.840
So I've kind of worked around the problem.

52:54.840 --> 52:57.700
Aaron Powell So you're kind of like I am sort of like that

52:57.700 --> 53:00.960
because with the Bonobo, the battery life was going to be two and a half hours, three

53:00.960 --> 53:03.380
hours regardless after a couple of years, right?

53:03.380 --> 53:07.120
It's a big desktop killer with a small and I just got I just became honey badger about

53:07.120 --> 53:08.680
the battery.

53:08.680 --> 53:13.360
But here I am with the Apollo now it was Skylake and I'm getting almost six hours without a

53:13.360 --> 53:14.360
lot of effort.

53:14.360 --> 53:18.960
And I'm starting to think, all right, well, maybe if I dial this in a little bit because

53:18.960 --> 53:23.200
I was in the middle of an awesome Minecraft mod exploration with the kids last night and

53:23.200 --> 53:28.640
then my battery died and I and my dad, my son was like, Dad, why didn't you bring your

53:28.640 --> 53:29.640
power cord?

53:29.640 --> 53:31.680
Well, I normally I don't need it.

53:31.680 --> 53:33.320
I didn't plan on running Java, son.

53:33.320 --> 53:34.320
I mean, right.

53:34.320 --> 53:35.320
Oh, my God.

53:35.320 --> 53:40.400
Do you ever just run power top and change all the configurable and this is the other

53:40.400 --> 53:46.400
thing is I have in the past, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

53:46.400 --> 53:50.920
This is CNN breaking news.

53:50.920 --> 53:55.880
Wimpy you're telling me seven hours and 30 minutes on your Apollo.

53:55.880 --> 53:56.880
Yes, comfortably.

53:56.880 --> 53:57.880
And it's OK.

53:57.880 --> 53:58.880
All right.

53:58.880 --> 53:59.880
There you go.

53:59.880 --> 54:00.880
I got to do it.

54:00.880 --> 54:03.200
I mean, if I could get another hour and a half out of my machine.

54:03.200 --> 54:04.200
Yeah.

54:04.200 --> 54:05.200
Holy smokes.

54:05.200 --> 54:09.040
I will say I also was using that Apricity OS, which based on Arch for a while, they

54:09.040 --> 54:10.520
have TLP installed by default.

54:10.520 --> 54:13.160
And that also I've noticed is run for quite a long time.

54:13.160 --> 54:14.160
All right.

54:14.160 --> 54:15.160
I'm going to put it looks here.

54:15.160 --> 54:16.160
Look at the archway.

54:16.160 --> 54:18.440
You pretty much just install it and start it and I'm going to do it.

54:18.440 --> 54:19.600
I'm going to have no excuse.

54:19.600 --> 54:20.600
I will give it a go.

54:20.600 --> 54:22.000
I'm going to put the link in the show notes.

54:22.000 --> 54:25.600
If you guys are curious about that, I will toss it in there.

54:25.600 --> 54:28.000
So it sounds like TLP in 2016.

54:28.000 --> 54:29.000
Still worth doing.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
Not that I didn't think it was.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.400
I'm just a little disappointed.

54:31.400 --> 54:32.640
Is that weird?

54:32.640 --> 54:38.160
I just wish that I just I guess I look at I look at like those love the frickin MacBook

54:38.160 --> 54:43.000
with the single USB port that supposedly gets 12 years of battery life and you breathe on

54:43.000 --> 54:46.160
it and it gets another two hours of battery life just by like breathing on it.

54:46.160 --> 54:51.080
I look at that and I go, man, I wish we had something kind of similar to that.

54:51.080 --> 54:55.120
But then with the Apollo, I get so damn close.

54:55.120 --> 54:56.960
Just seems like it might be worth a little bit.

54:56.960 --> 54:58.600
And the TLP setup requires no config.

54:58.600 --> 54:59.600
All right.

54:59.600 --> 55:00.600
Well, there you go.

55:00.600 --> 55:01.600
Yeah.

55:01.600 --> 55:02.600
So there you go.

55:02.600 --> 55:03.600
That seems like the way to go.

55:03.600 --> 55:04.600
Not to report back next week.

55:04.600 --> 55:05.600
See how long you can go.

55:05.600 --> 55:06.600
Yeah.

55:06.600 --> 55:10.120
I mean, I was also considering for a little while doing battery life tests more more like

55:10.120 --> 55:11.120
standardized.

55:11.120 --> 55:12.120
Yeah.

55:12.120 --> 55:13.760
But to me, it's a lot of work.

55:13.760 --> 55:17.000
It also it seems like it's so dependent on your workload, like your screen brightness

55:17.000 --> 55:18.080
is a huge part of it.

55:18.080 --> 55:19.840
So it feels like a little bit of black magic.

55:19.840 --> 55:23.960
Like people can talk big, but you have to put in a fair bit to like get a workload that

55:23.960 --> 55:25.920
you can use as an example consistently.

55:25.920 --> 55:26.920
Yeah.

55:26.920 --> 55:27.920
Yeah.

55:27.920 --> 55:28.920
Yeah.

55:28.920 --> 55:29.920
Yeah.

55:29.920 --> 55:30.920
OK.

55:30.920 --> 55:31.920
And you know what?

55:31.920 --> 55:34.960
If those of you out there in the audience have experimented a little bit with TLP and

55:34.960 --> 55:37.200
your different experience, I would just be I would like to know.

55:37.200 --> 55:40.920
I would like to know what you have seen out there.

55:40.920 --> 55:45.440
So links to everything we've talked about so far, including Cherry Music, Madsonic, TLP

55:45.440 --> 55:47.560
and all that stuff over at Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

55:47.560 --> 55:52.560
Just go look for episode 143 of the Unplugged program.

55:52.560 --> 55:59.480
We are about to talk a little bit about Linux containers, yes, Linux containers, everybody,

55:59.480 --> 56:04.580
and how they can be relevant to you and I. Wes, you are a soldier, sir.

56:04.580 --> 56:10.000
You have experimented and gone off and upgraded a bunch of your servers to Ubuntu 16.04.

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
That's right.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.200
You've begun experimenting with Linux containers.

56:13.200 --> 56:16.920
So before we get to all of that, I want to mention Linux Academy.

56:16.920 --> 56:22.360
If I say the word container and you go, I don't actually know what that means.

56:22.360 --> 56:26.920
If that thought has crossed the back of your head, maybe you should check out Linux Academy.

56:26.920 --> 56:28.580
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

56:28.580 --> 56:32.680
Go there to take advantage of the unplugged discount and support this show.

56:32.680 --> 56:33.680
Linux Academy.

56:33.680 --> 56:36.600
Just so you guys know, this is the essentials created by people that love Linux and want

56:36.600 --> 56:37.600
to spread the word.

56:37.600 --> 56:43.020
They wanted a platform, so they went and found a great group of developers and enthusiasts.

56:43.020 --> 56:44.020
They came together.

56:44.020 --> 56:45.200
They created the Linux Academy.

56:45.200 --> 56:50.460
They now have 2,379 self-paced courses, comprehensive study guides you get to download.

56:50.460 --> 56:55.200
You can be like a Skookie Sprite there and listen in the shower, download them.

56:55.200 --> 56:56.200
I love that story.

56:56.200 --> 56:59.840
And you know, Seth might have been the first person to tell me that he listens in the shower,

56:59.840 --> 57:04.000
but he was certainly not the last person to tell me that, which I think is kind of funny.

57:04.000 --> 57:07.040
They have scenario-based labs, which will put you right in the middle of every day,

57:07.040 --> 57:08.040
common tasks.

57:08.040 --> 57:11.540
They have nuggets that will go deep into one single topic, you know, might last about

57:11.540 --> 57:14.040
two minutes, might be an hour, depends on the topic.

57:14.040 --> 57:15.040
They have live events.

57:15.040 --> 57:16.520
They have instructor mentoring, which is huge.

57:16.520 --> 57:20.600
They'll teach you how to use all of the technology around Linux, the essentials, the advanced

57:20.600 --> 57:24.520
topics and the stuff that will make you money on Linux, the stuff you can use to improve

57:24.520 --> 57:29.320
your career, the stuff you can use to charge clients, the stuff you can use to better your

57:29.320 --> 57:30.320
knowledge set.

57:30.320 --> 57:33.400
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

57:33.400 --> 57:35.920
Graded server exercises will give you real results.

57:35.920 --> 57:36.920
It's nice.

57:36.920 --> 57:38.600
Seven plus distros to choose from.

57:38.600 --> 57:40.160
They're always updating the content.

57:40.160 --> 57:47.920
You know, I talked about containers kind of jokingly, but seriously, I can't envision

57:47.920 --> 57:50.180
a better resource to learn more about containers.

57:50.180 --> 57:52.160
Like they are passionate about this stuff.

57:52.160 --> 57:55.920
They were writing a courseware on Docker while other people were joking about it.

57:55.920 --> 58:00.000
They understand where things are going because they are so enthusiastic about this and they

58:00.000 --> 58:02.640
have a great, great set of courseware on containers.

58:02.640 --> 58:06.480
Now we're about to get into containers and if anything we talk about intrigues you, go

58:06.480 --> 58:12.480
check them out at LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

58:12.480 --> 58:13.480
All right, Mr. West.

58:13.480 --> 58:19.160
So you said to me, OK, Chris, I know we've talked about Ubuntu 16.04 a lot, but let's

58:19.160 --> 58:20.280
be real.

58:20.280 --> 58:23.520
We've mostly focused on the desktop where we've trashed on it a little bit.

58:23.520 --> 58:25.960
I mean, does anyone even use Linux on the desktop?

58:25.960 --> 58:26.960
I don't know.

58:26.960 --> 58:27.960
No, I kid.

58:27.960 --> 58:28.960
Obviously.

58:28.960 --> 58:29.960
Oh, my gosh.

58:29.960 --> 58:30.960
Oh, my gosh.

58:30.960 --> 58:36.240
But, you know, there's the whole other element of the Ubuntu server.

58:36.240 --> 58:38.720
The server where it's actually hugely successful.

58:38.720 --> 58:40.120
So have you used it at all?

58:40.120 --> 58:41.120
Yeah.

58:41.120 --> 58:42.120
Oh, yeah.

58:42.120 --> 58:43.120
Yeah.

58:43.120 --> 58:45.920
André, wait, do I have any local 16.04 servers?

58:45.920 --> 58:46.920
No.

58:46.920 --> 58:47.920
No, I don't.

58:47.920 --> 58:53.080
I only have, I only have digital ocean droplets, but we've got a handful of them now.

58:53.080 --> 58:55.240
And I don't really have anything to say.

58:55.240 --> 58:56.720
I guess that's a good thing.

58:56.720 --> 58:59.000
Yeah, they just they just freaking run.

58:59.000 --> 59:00.880
We've set up a software on them.

59:00.880 --> 59:02.640
We have some 14.04 droplets.

59:02.640 --> 59:05.840
We want to move to 16.04 because we I'll tell you one.

59:05.840 --> 59:06.840
OK, OK, OK.

59:06.840 --> 59:09.680
I'll tell you one thing that I have noticed.

59:09.680 --> 59:10.680
OK.

59:10.680 --> 59:15.480
It is a pain in the ass now to like it is a major pain in the ass to write and it scripts

59:15.480 --> 59:16.720
for upstart.

59:16.720 --> 59:18.880
And it's like the last thing I want to do.

59:18.880 --> 59:22.640
It's the last thing anybody on the JB crew wants to do is learn upstart at this point.

59:22.640 --> 59:23.640
Oh, my gosh.

59:23.640 --> 59:24.640
Yes.

59:24.640 --> 59:25.640
Who wants to learn upstart?

59:25.640 --> 59:26.640
No.

59:26.640 --> 59:27.640
It's dead.

59:27.640 --> 59:28.640
Yeah, exactly.

59:28.640 --> 59:29.640
And here's the other thing is that tons of the projects I've been using for a while now

59:29.640 --> 59:30.640
have system dnit scripts.

59:30.640 --> 59:31.640
Yep.

59:31.640 --> 59:32.640
They come.

59:32.640 --> 59:33.640
They're right there.

59:33.640 --> 59:34.640
Yes.

59:34.640 --> 59:35.640
Yes.

59:35.640 --> 59:36.640
Yes.

59:36.640 --> 59:38.640
So that is sort of the nicest thing about 16.04 is now I'm just like looking.

59:38.640 --> 59:43.000
I can use those examples and things, but that's pretty much the entire summary of my review

59:43.000 --> 59:44.000
from servers.

59:44.000 --> 59:45.000
It works.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.000
I don't really have any complaints.

59:46.000 --> 59:50.200
And it does everything I expect, which, by the way, exactly what I want on my server.

59:50.200 --> 59:51.200
It just it just it.

59:51.200 --> 59:52.200
Yeah, it's consistent.

59:52.200 --> 59:55.880
So you, however, you, however, have had a bit of a bigger route.

59:55.880 --> 59:58.880
I'm in the weird position of like, I mean, I use arch for a lot of things.

59:58.880 --> 01:00:01.920
It's the most what I'm most familiar these days with I know how to, you know, bend it

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:05.240
to my will get whatever I done need to do done with it.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:09.000
I'm in the position where I'm considering switching to Ubuntu for for a lot of my larger

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:15.880
services, mostly because of Lex D as they call it, which is Lex D 2.0 is just released

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:21.760
and that's their container lighter visor, they jokingly call it and it's and it's meant

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:27.600
to be a new way to interact with the Linux container or Lexi subsystem in the infrastructure

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.600
they've set up.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:32.160
So if you're not familiar, you can go to Linux containers.com, I believe.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:38.280
Yeah, Linux containers.org, dot org, backslash, Alex deep backslash, try dash it, which we

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:39.280
will have a link in the show.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.720
And you can give it a try right now.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.240
And it's a now hold on.

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.880
When you say give it a try.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:48.920
You mean I can go to a web page and I can spin up a Alex D container in real time?

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:49.920
Yeah, let's do it.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:50.920
Let's do it right now.

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:51.920
You want to do it?

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.920
OK, here we go.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:59.600
So I am at Linux containers.org, slash Alex D, slash try dash it again, link in the show.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.600
Yeah, where's the IPv6 connectivity, Chris?

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:02.600
Oh, the studio.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:03.600
I know, right?

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.680
So I'm going to say I've accepted the terms of service because, of course, I do.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.680
They're pretty reasonable.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:10.320
Now, they are going to start the container on the fly now because we just gave up the

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.320
URL.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320
It's going to get slow here.

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:16.960
But before it gets slow, you can see right here, Wes, right here, boom, I got a console.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.880
I got an Alex D container.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:23.320
I'm now root inside a container nested inside an Alex D install, which is sort of like Alex

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.320
D inception.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.320
Yes, right.

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.320
What am I seeing here, Wes?

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:27.320
What am I seeing?

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:32.080
You're seeing they ran Alex C exec container name bash, and it just gets you executed as

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:34.720
root inside the container, a bash shell.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:35.720
This is pretty cool.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:36.880
This is a pretty cool way to do it.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:37.880
Yeah, it's pretty neat.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.600
So one of the neat things that they've Alex C was pretty complicated to use.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:45.780
It's really neat to use if you've ever tried it, if you need like system level containers.

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:49.800
But there's a lot of things to learn and a lot of configuration things to set up.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:50.800
Sure.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.920
Alex D or Alex D, it's a lot simpler.

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.840
And so you can kind of just get an image going and they have default profiles set up.

01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:02.640
So the default one, it runs as an unprivileged container, meaning that it actually runs in

01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.680
a user namespace.

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.000
So that root in the container is no longer root on your host.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.600
It's actually matched to like UID 1 million or something like that.

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.600
So hopefully that get you some added security.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:17.680
But it also has like default profiles if you want to run Docker in there, you just change

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:21.400
your container to be on the Docker profile and they tweak some of the security settings

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:26.800
and the like nesting settings so that you can run Docker inside your container.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.920
So you're just starting to play with this.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:28.920
But how's the workflow?

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.920
But is it pretty easy to use?

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.920
It's neat.

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.640
So Alex C used kind of a template workflow, so where you'd use something like pack strap

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:37.880
or bootstrap or whatever to like get your container implemented on the machine you're

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:38.880
running it on.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:44.640
Lex D uses an image-based format, so you actually just have like a tar gz of your container

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.640
root file system.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:49.120
And it also takes great advantage of ZFS.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120
It's awesome.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:54.320
So like in 16.04 you just install the userland tools, the kernel module is built for you,

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.580
you just load that up.

01:02:55.580 --> 01:03:02.040
It has a pseudo LXD in it and it'll walk you through and it'll even set you up like a loopback

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.860
mounted ZFS file system if you want.

01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:06.520
So that's what I'm using on the laptop here.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:09.320
Or if you want to have, you know, you have actual like pool of disk to use, you can use

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.300
that or use one that you already have.

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:15.480
And so what that means is when you want to use like a new, they give you some image servers

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:18.960
by default with the like, you know, Ubuntu 16.04 container image.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.240
You can just pull that down.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:25.680
But once you have that image, every new container you start, it's just a copy on write copy

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.680
of that, right?

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.080
So it's basically free except for what you change it.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.080
That's slick.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.680
And all, again, super easy to set up.

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.480
And I've already set up like an archiver.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.560
So they don't have, they have like Alpine, they have Fedora.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:40.760
So you're saying, you're saying you have, okay, so for example, if I were to do this

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:46.960
on a, on a droplet, I could have an Ubuntu 16.04 droplet, but in the container run arch.

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:47.960
Yep, absolutely.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.280
So they don't have one provided on there.

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:55.240
They have like an image, images.linuxcontainers.org, where they have like Fedora, Cora, like lots

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:58.160
of prebuilt stuff for you, but arch wasn't one of them.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:01.320
But you just take a, you know, you make a reasonable arch file system, you package it

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.960
up in a tar and it's really easy to get it as your own.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:07.240
Then you can, they, the other neat thing is it's a networked, like it's all done over

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.360
a REST API.

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.900
That's like, that's how the client talks to it.

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:10.900
That's how you can talk to it.

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.920
They have Python bindings and it also talks over the network.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:18.700
So I can have a server here and then a server on a droplet somewhere and I can go make myself

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:20.320
a new image, have containers here.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:23.400
And if I make a container I really like here, I can just push it over to the server and

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.400
it will run there.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.400
That is nice.

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:26.400
Talk about rapid development.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:29.160
You can even snapshot up here, then push the snapshot up to this.

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.160
It's I'm really excited.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.640
I might have to change a lot of my infrastructure to use this now.

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:38.120
That is super, super neat and sounds like it didn't take a ton of time to figure out

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.120
how to get down.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.120
I'm consistently surprised with how easy it is.

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.120
Huh.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.120
I got to play with that.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.120
Cool.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.120
Okay.

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.520
So the chat room has been talking about a topic, Wes, that I want to cover before I

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:53.600
get to my Lara Croft review because there has been something we have done a few times

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:57.000
on the show is we've given Mr. Leo Laporte a hard time.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.320
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.440
About his Linux coverage.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:05.320
And so I feel like it's only fair when Leo sits down and does his homework and does a

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:08.400
pretty good job of it at that, that we give it some attention.

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:12.620
So I want to just play a moment from the recent, the new screensavers on some help he gave

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:13.620
on Linux.

01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:14.620
On the line.

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:17.800
Let's do it.

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.720
On the line with us right now.

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:23.280
I don't know your name, sir.

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.280
Who is this?

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.280
Jason.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.280
Jason is on the line.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.280
Hi, Jason.

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.280
Where are you calling from?

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.280
Hi, Leo.

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.280
Calling from Manhattan, Kansas.

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.280
I want to talk to you.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.280
There he is.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:35.120
So, Jason, tell us, tell us your question.

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.440
Well, I've been a long time Linux, sorry, Linux user.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.920
I grew up calling it Linux.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:40.920
I know.

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.920
I know.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.920
A lot of people did.

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:43.920
Yeah.

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.560
But I've got a handful of older computers, netbooks.

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:50.000
We're talking core two duos, nothing really older than that.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:56.600
I've tried some of the slimmed down versions of Linux, either Laboon 2 or LXDE, even Puppy

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.600
Linux.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.600
Puppy's a little too techie.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:04.040
I'd like something that, a slimmed down version that'll run well, looking to run Flash, DVDs.

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.040
Flash?

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:06.040
Flash.

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.040
I know.

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.040
Still trying to run YouTube.

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:12.800
Well, you don't need YouTube, doesn't need Flash anymore, so you can...

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:13.800
Oh, that's true.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:14.800
You're right.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.800
Yeah.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.800
I'm hoping that...

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.800
By the way, who needs Flash?

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:20.800
Twit.tv still runs Flash, because we use a player.

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:24.120
We don't have control of it that plays back Ustream and BitGravity, and they're using

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.120
Flash.

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:27.400
Although they're moving away from it, as our providers do.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.520
I'm hoping we won't see Flash much longer.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.520
It's dying, as everybody knows.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.960
As it should.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:33.960
So...

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:37.360
I'm looking for suggestions for something else that's...

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:42.560
Maybe not something else, but a different spin of Linux that works well with older hardware,

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.560
but not too techie.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:48.080
Something that I can put on it and basically hand to my mom.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:49.080
There's the kicker.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:51.960
Unfortunately, this is almost a contradiction in terms, right?

01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:56.320
I think this is kind of non-intuitive, but I've always said that the more a person is

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:59.000
a novice, the better the computer they need.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.560
Not the vice versa, because...

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:01.560
So he's been...

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.560
The vice versa.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:03.560
He's been talking about Linux a lot.

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:06.440
He goes into a whole description here about Cinnamon.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:07.440
He does a whole...

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.440
Professor Leo.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.440
Yeah.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.440
He gets all...

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:15.420
We use this kind of generic term Linux for something that's really so much more.

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:17.880
The only thing that's Linux is the stuff way down here.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.000
This is the kernel.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:27.180
And that's the stuff that Linus Torvalds wrote back in 1994 or 92 when he was a graduate

01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:28.960
student in Finland.

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:29.960
He wrote...

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:30.960
I feel like I'm in school.

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:31.960
What's nice about...

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:32.960
I know.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:33.960
And you know what's funny about this?

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.160
And I'll leave the link in the show notes if you guys want to watch the whole thing.

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:41.200
What's funny about this is it tells me two things about Linux adoption.

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.200
Number one, we are so screwed.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:45.360
And number two, it's great to have Leo as an advocate.

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:46.360
Yeah, it is.

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:51.120
The first thing it tells me is, and I'm not joking when I say this, you need a fricking

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:54.640
whiteboard if you're a Windows or Mac user to figure out, or I'm sorry, chalkboard in

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.600
this case, how to use Linux.

01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:59.760
Like Leo talks about the fact that he has a dozen thumb drives with different Linux

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:00.760
distros on there.

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:01.880
He talks about trying Debian.

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:02.940
He talks about trying Mint.

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:05.040
He talks about trying Zubuntu and Unity.

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.560
And he talks about trying Antigros.

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:13.520
He has gone through a sludge of crap to get to where he's at now.

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.520
It's too much.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.520
Right.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:19.080
It takes an average savvy Windows user to do what he's done.

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.080
So anyways, it's interesting.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.080
And I'm glad he's trying it.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.080
And it's a good advocate.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.840
But yeah, he actually seems to know what he's talking about.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:25.840
I'm impressed.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:26.840
Yeah.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:27.840
Yeah.

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:36.360
Now maybe he could play with LXDE and LXD or LXC, not LXDE, and tell us what he thinks.

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:37.360
Yeah.

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.840
I'm excited about that, Wes.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:39.840
OK.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:40.840
So let's get to it.

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.920
I've been teasing it all episode.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.800
Tomb Raider is finally here for Linux.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:52.240
The 2013 edition of Tomb Raider is available for Linux.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.480
And I had a chance to give it a try.

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:59.320
And I've got to say, I'm not too disappointed.

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:06.720
If you're watching here, Wes, this was something I played a little bit earlier on the livestream.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:09.120
This was me playing a little Tomb Raider.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.640
And the graphics are pretty good.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.520
Now if you're watching this back on the video version, you're watching an encoding of an

01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:15.520
encoding.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:18.520
So you know, the graphics are going to be what they are.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:19.520
Careful.

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:24.880
But I'll tell you, this game is fun.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.840
First of all, it's very immersive.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:33.480
The one downside I'll have is there's a lot of quick time events, like this right here.

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.480
You're running around.

01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:35.480
All of a sudden, it just takes over.

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:36.480
Now you just watch.

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:49.440
You have like a token key you have to press from time to time.

01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:52.760
But they do a good job of making Lara Croft feel like a real character.

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.760
That's awesome.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:54.760
Yeah.

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:57.800
And I'll tell you, Wes, I have a special connection.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.800
Look at that.

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:00.800
Very painful.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:01.800
Yeah.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:03.640
They are violent with Lara in this game.

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.640
They get really rough.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:05.640
Lara.

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:06.640
They are.

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:07.640
They are.

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:10.080
They are really rough with her, like ridiculously so.

01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:13.640
But you know, when I first played Tomb Raider, it was when I had a Matrox video card and

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:14.640
I upgraded it.

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:15.640
Oh, Matrox.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:16.640
Never heard that name for a while.

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:17.640
I know.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:18.840
And I popped in four megabytes of VRAM.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:21.840
I had a grand total from two megabytes to four megabytes.

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:25.320
And my four, my two megabyte upgrade came with the Tomb Raider CD.

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.320
Oh, very cool.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.320
Yeah.

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.320
That was my first Tomb Raider experience.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.320
I remember the original Tomb Raider.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.320
Yeah.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:34.760
So even though it's a 2013 game, it's still very fun for me to be able to try it.

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.320
And it supports Linux mail.

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.320
The graphics are great.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.320
Yeah.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.320
It looks beautiful.

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.320
Yeah.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.320
Sorry.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:48.760
The actress who does the voice work for Lara Croft, Keely Hawes, was recently on a TV

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:54.800
program talking about this, you know, and the work that she had to do and how much work

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.680
that she did in this new Lara Croft thing.

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:02.560
And she talked about the fact that her son loves to play the game and it's a bit weird

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:06.680
for her to hear her own voice screaming out at her son.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:07.680
Yeah.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.680
But it's awesome.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:12.760
Yeah, it is very cool to see these great games coming to Linux.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:19.280
And yeah, it's maybe not the best game ever, but I've really enjoyed playing it.

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.880
So if you're looking to buy a Steam game-

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.640
How are the system requirements, Chris?

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:25.600
Well, you got to have, that's actually one of the nice things I like about it is you

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:29.800
got to have, while you do have to have a decent system, Wes, they have a built in benchmark.

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:30.800
Oh, nice.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:31.960
So here, I'll launch it right now.

01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:34.400
So you can get a sense of if it's going to work on your rig.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.600
And I know how nice of a machine you have now.

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:41.920
Oh, so, and I don't know, Mr. Skookiesprite, have you had a chance to try out the new Tomb

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:42.920
Raider?

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.840
You know, doing your best Linux games podcast, you got to be trying these things, right?

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.840
Are you kidding?

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:52.520
I beat it in the first 14 hours of it coming out for Linux.

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:55.600
It like launched on Steam at like 11 o'clock at night.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:00.760
I was just going to bed and I'm like, oh, Tomb Raider, okay, well, I better probably

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:01.760
play this.

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:07.480
So I played it in one 10 hour sitting, and then I had meetings that morning and three

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:09.760
hours later, I finished it off 10 hours later.

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:10.760
I think it's awesome.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:14.040
It's one of the best adventure games I've ever played.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:16.580
And it's easily the best looking game I've ever played on Linux.

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:21.360
So I'm running the benchmark right now, which you say, benchmarks not so accurate, is it?

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:27.080
Oh, God, no, it's like, on mine, it says like the average is like, the average frame rate

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.880
is like 222 frames per second or something like that.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.160
It's just out of control.

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.200
It's like, it's old and weird.

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:37.680
So what I think it is, is I actually think that, I don't, I get like 80 or something.

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:38.680
I can't remember.

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:39.680
I'm benchmarking right now.

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:40.680
I'll tell you in a second.

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.600
But I think the game still has some glitches under Linux.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.520
There's a few performance glitches here and there.

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:50.040
I'll get a one benchmark for the frame rate and then I end up with a completely different

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.400
thing during gameplay.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.420
But as you watch this benchmark, you can see they add cool effects and stuff.

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:55.420
It's pretty nice.

01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:56.880
Go ahead, Scooby.

01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:00.640
One of the things that's weird, because like the second I beat it, I started playing it

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:03.920
again because that's how much I enjoyed it on hard.

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:10.280
And this time, I had some problems with janky camera angles in my first 20 hours of the

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.280
game.

01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:14.800
And it seems like either they pushed an update to it or something, but I have not had any

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.120
camera problems.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.840
And especially if you run it on normal instead of like high, to like the settings, it makes

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:26.160
a big difference in the performance because it cuts down on the reflections, I think.

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:27.160
Yeah, I agree.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.280
The benchmark is a little crazy.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:29.400
So I just got on the benchmark.

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:33.880
I got 80.6 minimum as my minimum frames per second.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:37.120
And I got max of 170.3 with an average of...

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.600
Yeah, that's not happening.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.820
That's crazy.

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:42.320
That's totally crazy.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.320
That's so ridiculous.

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.040
It's like during the menus.

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.040
Yeah.

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:51.880
Well, it's like they do like this cool panorama view where they like load more and more stuff.

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:55.880
So you'd think it'd be accurate, but it's got to be like some sort of best case scenario.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:56.880
I don't know.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:01.040
A couple of other just quick notes, Steam Sync works, so I played it for a little bit

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.040
on my computer upstairs.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:03.040
It's able to resume right away.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.040
Oh, I love that.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.040
Yeah.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:08.640
Also, Linux Game Cast and the Linux Gamer gave some great reviews of this game.

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:10.520
I'll have links to those in the show notes.

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:13.920
And Mr. Skookiesprite, again, give people a plug where they can find your podcast.

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.480
I assume you'll be talking about this.

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.480
Oh, yeah.

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.440
No, I already reviewed it on Saturday.

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.440
Atta boy.

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.440
Atta boy.

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.440

01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:28.560
I will have a link to that as well in the show notes, so that way you guys can follow

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.880
the reviews of all of that.

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:33.940
I'm excited to see a good game come out because this was like one of my first, like, I built

01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:38.940
a PC and then I upgraded from two megabytes of VRAM to four megabytes and got Tomb Raider.

01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:40.440
So yeah, right?

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.600
That was a big deal for me.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.600
I really thought that was huge.

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:48.560
Anyways, that'll pretty much wrap us up for this week's episode of The Unplugged Program.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:50.740

Slash contact.

01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:01.920
Mumble room, is there anything else that the collective hive mind wants to cover before

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.840
we wrap up on this week's episode?

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:05.840
Going once.

01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:06.840
Going twice.

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:15.600
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.600
Oh!

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:17.600
And there you have it.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:18.600
There you have it.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:23.480
RMS runs GNU slash K Windows.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.360

And we'll see you right back here, next Tuesday!

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:38.640
Hot tip from crack editor Rekai.

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.360
It looks like the Steam Controller is on sale right now.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.240
Have you ever given that another chance?

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.520
You know, I should, huh?

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.520
Especially with newer kernels?

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.520
40% off.

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.840
It seems like it might be worth time to give it another chance.

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:49.840
That's a good deal.

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:51.840
That is a good deal.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:57.280
So you know, when I shaved the stache on Sunday, I didn't think about how the children would

01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:58.280
react.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.280
Oh right, that's a big deal.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.960
I remember when my dad shaved his beard as a young child.

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:02.960
Yes!

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:03.960
It's like, who are you?

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:07.420
It is actually a big deal, and I totally didn't think about that, because I remember when

01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:09.920
my dad had a beard and then went to no beard.

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:10.920
It's a big deal.

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:12.020
It was a big deal!

01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:18.800
And so I shaved on Sunday afternoon, right, and then I saw the kids Monday.

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.400
And I gotta tell you, the reaction was not good.

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:22.400
No.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.080
Abby told me it was dumb.

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.640
Oh, wow, that's cold.

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.200
But you know what Dylan told me?

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:32.480
Dad, my dream is to grow a beard and a mustache.

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:33.480
How could you shave it?

01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:34.480
That's what my son said.

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:35.480
So how'd you explain it?

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:36.480
Did you tell him?

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:37.480
Dad, it's too funny.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:40.200
Uncle Noah did too well.

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:44.080
And then my youngest, my youngest said, Daddy, did you do that for Noah?

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:46.600
And I said, yes, Bella, I did it for Noah.

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:48.020
I hate Noah now.

01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:49.020
He took the beard away.

01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:51.440
You know what Bella said?

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:52.440
It's okay, Daddy.

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:53.440
I still like your hair.

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:58.520
I love my kids, dude.

01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.520
So perfect.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:02.280
So it was like, yeah, okay, good, good, that makes me feel better.

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:05.920
But all of them unanimously agreed, I gotta grow it back.

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.320
I gotta grow it back.

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:10.560
Now- Or you could shave, go all the way.

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.560
Go all the way?

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.560
Yeah.

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:13.560
I don't think so.

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.560
Oh, man.

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:20.880
You know, I am a geek because I totally love this post.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:23.720
And this was such a, this was clickbait for Linux users.

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:31.880
If I was a Linux fish, I would be cut, filleted, and served on a Alder wood platter right now

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:38.040
because Tech Mint totally got me with 20 funny commands for Linux.

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.640
Okay, all right.

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:41.000
Let's do it real fast.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.600
So first of all, did you know that there's something called, there's a package called

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.600
SL?

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:45.600
Do you know about SL?

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:46.600
Oh, yeah.

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:47.600
You do?

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.600
You do know about it?

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:49.600
Steam locomotive.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.600
Oh, look at you.

01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:51.600
All right.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.600
So let's, I'm gonna do a packer search for SL right now.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.800
I absolutely never install it, but I am familiar.

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.200
So oh boy, there's a whole bunch of stuff.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:59.280
I don't know, of course, a whole bunch of open SSL stuff came up when I searched for

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.280
that.

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:01.280
That was a horrible idea.

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:02.280
What was I thinking?

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:05.680
Of course, this is a total, absolute and complete, look at this list, dude.

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:07.760
This list is 20 pages long.

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:11.840
I just, okay, you know what I'm gonna do just for sake of content, I'm gonna just install

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.840
SL and see what we get.

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.840
Because why not, right?

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:15.840
Let's just find out.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:16.840
Well, I've got my container right here.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:17.840
All right.

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:18.840
So now I'm installed on my machine.

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:19.840
I'm gonna run SL.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:20.840
Are you ready?

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.280
So first of all, I want to launch it in a terminal window.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:23.280
So I'll hold it.

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.280
Here we go.

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:25.280
Let's go find out what SL is.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:26.280
SL.

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.280
It's a steam locomotive.

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:28.280
Look at that.

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.280
Isn't that beautiful?

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:31.280
It actually is really cool.

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:32.400
That is really cool.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:39.400
So there is this, there is this post over at TechBind about the 20 awesome Linux commands.

01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:40.400
You know what?

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:42.480
Hold on a second.

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.480
Telnet.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:45.600
I don't even know if I have Telnet installed.

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.320
Telnet and then blinkinglights.nl.

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.320
Let's see.

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:49.320
I don't even know.

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.320
Oh, classic.

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:51.320
Oh, I do have Telnet installed.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:52.320
All right.

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.860
So here we go.

01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:55.400
So what do I do, Wes?

01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.480
Do you know what I do after this point?

01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:58.480
Just watch.

01:19:58.480 --> 01:19:59.480
Just watch.

01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:01.280
Just stand by and watch.

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.440
Okay.

01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:03.440
I'm watching.

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:04.440
I maximize.

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:05.440
Maybe I don't need to maximize.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.440
Hmm.

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.160
So this is supposed to be the 20th century.

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.360
Oh yeah, here we go.

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:14.400
Yeah, it's Star Wars.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:15.400
It's Star Wars and the Terminal.

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:16.400
Oh yeah.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.400
I knew it.

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.400
I knew it.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:19.400
I knew it.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:20.400
Star Wars and the Terminal.

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.400
Oh, what's this one?

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.400
Command toilet.

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:23.400
I don't think I've heard of that one before.

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:24.400
No.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:25.400
Are you serious?

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:26.400
Number nine.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.400
Hold on.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.400
Hold on.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.400
Scroll your ass down there.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.400
Terminal.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.400
Okay.

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:32.400
Toilet.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.400
Install toilet.

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:34.400
All right.

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.400
Do you think toilet is a package in art?

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:36.400
Let's find out.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.400
It's a package everywhere.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.400
It's been around for years and years and years.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:39.960
How come I don't know about it?

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.360
This is what I'm asking myself.

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.680
How do you not know all of these?

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:43.920
I know.

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:49.080
This list is, not only is it horrible, obvious clickbait, but it is totally old command.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:52.240
Some of them are like, message of the day, like, okay.

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.240
I know about-

01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.240
Yes.

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.240
Yeah.

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:56.240
All right.

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:57.240
Okay.

01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:58.240
All right.

01:20:58.240 --> 01:20:59.240
I'm installing toilet right now.

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:00.240
All right.

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:01.240
And I'm going to run toilet.

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:02.240
I've never had a toilet command.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:03.240
Hold on.

01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.240
I don't want to run it in Guake.

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:06.160
I want to give toilet its own dedicated terminal.

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:10.200
So let me open up its own dedicated gnome terminal just for toilet.

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:11.200
Okay.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:12.200
All right.

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.200
Here we go.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:14.200
Tab completing toilet.

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.460
Are you ready, Wes?

01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:18.760
I've never been more ready.

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:19.760
What happens when you run it?

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.240
You have to give it some text.

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:22.240
Okay.

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:23.240
Oh, okay.

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:24.240
Off fart.

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:25.240
Oh.

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:26.240
Okay.

01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:27.240
So that's all it does?

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:28.240
Is it just-

01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:29.240
Do toilet dash dash gay.

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:30.240
And then the piece of text.

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:31.240
It's much nicer.

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:32.240
Dash dash gay?

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:33.240
Yes.

01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:37.200
Dash dash gay and then do I do the text on the same command line or do I wait for-

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:38.200
Yeah.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.200
Do toilet dash dash gay space.

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.200
Hello world or something.

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.200
Okay.

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.200
All right.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.200
Hello.

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:44.200
Do I need to use quotes?

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.200
No.

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:46.200
Hello world.

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.200
Okay.

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.200
Oh.

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.200
Now that is great.

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:50.200
Look at it.

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.200
It's a rainbow.

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:56.160
And if you do toilet dash dash gay dash dash IRC hello world, then it gives you all the

01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:58.480
ANSI codes that you could paste into IRC.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.400
You know, I think I have seen this before now that I see it.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.880
How did I not know about this?

01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.320
This is so wonderful.

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:05.320
Thank you, Popeye.

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.320
You're welcome.

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:12.160
I like that Popeye is our official expert on the toilet command.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.160
Thank you, Za.

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:14.160
Of course.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.160
There's a snap package in the store for toilets.

01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:34.160
Oh, beautiful.
