00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 27 for February 11th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,640
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's watching the Debian mailing

3
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,400
list and it's fresh all out of popcorn.

4
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,400
My name is Chris.

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,400
And my name is Matt.

6
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,440
Hey Matt, here we are.

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,960
We actually got the first word of it on Sunday as we were wrapping up last that it looked

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,840
like Debian was going to go with Systemd and I thought, okay, that's good, but let's not

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,840
run with it just yet.

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,160
It's not even crazy, because Debian doesn't just make decisions like that, right?

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,480
I don't just, boy, it has been an interesting couple of days.

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,680
And I know a lot of you are thinking, why do we care so much about an init system?

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,800
Well, we're going to talk about that a little bit.

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,840
There's a lot of actual larger ramifications.

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,480
I think a lot of people are very aware that Debian is the base of so many distributions

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,320
and a lot of things are changing in the Linux world.

17
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,600
And at the same time, some of these things are coming together.

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,360
And that's what the Systemd discussion isn't just happening at Debian, right?

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,200
It's been happening across all of the Linux distributions for a couple of years now.

20
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,400
And the Debian one has been one of the most watched and, unfortunately, not really been

21
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,520
the greatest example of open community collaboration.

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,720
And we could get into that whole discussion about should this stuff be on a public mailing

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,160
list, but it was.

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,760
And I kind of want to talk a little bit about that, too, and if maybe we've sort of sent

25
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,560
a bad signal to the rest of the industry.

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
We'll see.

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,040
I don't want to overstate it, but I think we'll discuss that aspect of it, too.

28
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,760
I think at the end of this episode, if you haven't been sure why this has been a topic

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,400
of interest for so many people, I hope by the time we're done, you will know why.

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,160
You'll feel like you've got a good grasp on it.

31
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,720
Hey, Matt, before we go too far, we should do a Valve update.

32
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,040
I just thought this was really cool.

33
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,240
I wanted to update a story we ran a couple of weeks ago and unplugged about Valve donating

34
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,320
games to Debian developers.

35
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,040
Well, they're expanding that program now to Ubuntu developers, too.

36
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
How about that?

37
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,640
That is exciting because it's not only showing that they're – because the Debian thing

38
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,680
could have been seen as a fluke, but I think the fact that they're being inclusive to

39
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,640
the Ubuntu guys as well is that they're saying, look, we really want Linux to take

40
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,320
off and we want to embrace those that put their time and energy into making Linux awesome.

41
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
And so they really get that.

42
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,320
Yeah.

43
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
1204 was there.

44
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,320
That was the distro they recommended.

45
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
That's right.

46
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
Yeah.

47
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,000
So, man, if they get Steam boxes, this is your chance now, guys.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,720
Go sign up to become a Debian developer or an Ubuntu developer.

49
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
Get your Steam box.

50
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,720
Because you never know.

51
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,640
What's going to happen, that's going to be next.

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,760
And there was – what was – there was another Valve story today, too.

53
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
Oh, that's right.

54
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
Right, right.

55
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,760
We were just talking about it on the pre-show.

56
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,400
Steam Dev Days, the videos from Steam Dev Days are now up and there's some of interest.

57
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,600
One we talked about on last is this switching to Linux, where Ikyulys went through some

58
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,280
of the reasons why switching to Linux, porting your game to Linux is not nearly as bad as

59
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,280
everybody thinks it is.

60
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,720
It's called getting started with Linux game development.

61
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,600
Anyways, all of the videos I think that are available now are linked on the SteamDevDays.com

62
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,320
page and I'm going to go through some of them.

63
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,880
And if there's something really crazy, I'll pull out and put it in the Linux Action Show

64
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
on Sunday.

65
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,360
But otherwise, you can just go check it out on your own because there's so many on there

66
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,640
that I'm sure we'd only be able to cover a tiny, tiny percentage of what was actually

67
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,440
said.

68
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,920
Speaking of last, on Sunday, one last little bit of business before we get into our main

69
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,400
topic of the day, Sunday, Linux Action Show, 10 a.m. Pacific, jblive.tv, the place to be

70
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,880
because it's episode 300.

71
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,120
Oh my goodness, big, big, big, big, big, big, huge, huge.

72
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,720
So we got a lot of stuff to talk about in episode 300.

73
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
We're going to celebrate.

74
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,040
It's not going to be, I haven't really decided how much of a regular Linux Action Show it's

75
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,040
going to be.

76
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,800
Probably depends on what's going on in the week.

77
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,400
But we have some stuff planned to talk about, so I'd really love to have you guys there

78
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,800
because it's a good one to join live and I think we'll have a good active community.

79
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
Maybe we can break the IRC server.

80
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,880
Maybe we'll load it up with so many people.

81
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,640
So I'd love to have you there this Sunday.

82
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,280
It'll be February 16th, I think that's it, yeah, 16th.

83
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,280
Yeah, I think that sounds right.

84
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,280
That sounds right.

85
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,080
And I think it's definitely one of those things to where if you don't normally show up for

86
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,200
a live show, make this the live show you show up for.

87
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,480
I think you'll be pretty glad you did.

88
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,120
Yeah, you know what?

89
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,920
It's better than getting bit by a dog.

90
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,600
This is true, especially if that dog wants to bite you.

91
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Yeah, yeah.

92
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,160
That was redundant, but you get the point.

93
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,640
Well, point well reiterated, Matt.

94
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,560
All right, well, so I want to take a second here and just thank Ting.

95
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,640
Ting is one of our sponsors this week and they're doing something really awesome.

96
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
So get started.

97
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,880
Go to linux.ting.com and if you're watching this live today, go over to their blog.

98
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,400
I don't know of any other cell phone company that would have done this.

99
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:06,760
Ting now, right now, if you go to ting.com slash blog, has the message up that a lot

100
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,920
of sites are running with today because it's take back the privacy day on the internet

101
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,000
and they have the call your legislators numbers and the submit for an email address right

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
here.

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,760
Ting is so out of control that the authors of the Patriot Act are sponsors of Lena Bill

104
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,760
to reign it in.

105
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,760
So they have these.

106
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,720
We have one running right now on the Jupiter Broadcasting website too.

107
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,600
Let's see if you go over to our, yeah, so here's the Jupiter Broadcasting website, thedaywefightback.org.

108
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,000
A lot of sites are doing this.

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,320
I just thought it was so awesome that Ting is one of them.

110
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
They didn't need to do this.

111
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,360
I mean, they, you know, but they did because Ting is, they're really kind of internet savvy

112
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,440
and that's one of the things I like about them quite a bit.

113
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,800
It shows in their dashboard too.

114
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,840
They have a really awesome and easy to use dashboard that follows web standards.

115
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,560
In fact, it even supports the Mozilla login system, which I like a lot.

116
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,840
We've had one of their developers on Coder Radio before to talk about it.

117
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,680
And what's great about Ting is there's no contracts, there's no early termination fees.

118
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,840
You only pay for what you use.

119
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,280
Each flat line is six dollars and then, you know, taxes and then it's just your usage.

120
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,400
If they take your message, your megabytes and your minutes, they add them all up at

121
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,800
the end of the month, whatever bucket you fall into, that's what you pay.

122
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
It's really straightforward.

123
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,000
You buy the device outright.

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You own it.

125
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,800
You're not paying some sort of subsidized price over the time of the device.

126
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
It's yours.

127
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,920
And one of the great things about Ting is every plan includes hotspot and tethering

128
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,600
and it's just part of your data usage.

129
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,160
You don't have to be in some sort of special plan.

130
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
You just turn it on.

131
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,200
You know that feature built into Android?

132
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,520
You should be able to just turn it on.

133
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,600
That's why, that's why Google put it there and that's how Ting works.

134
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,960
Ting also has awesome no-hold customer service.

135
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,080
You can give them a call anytime between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. eastern and an actual person

136
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
answers the phone.

137
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
What a concept!

138
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,120
I've been able to activate like 14 devices though, all through the dashboard.

139
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
It's really great.

140
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,640
They have an iPhone and Android app to manage your account as well.

141
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,640
And you can check them out by going to linux.ting.com.

142
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,240
They'll take $25 off your first device or $25 off your first month if you already have

143
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
a compatible device.

144
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,380
Check out their BYOD page.

145
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,400
I'm telling you, I've been using them for over a year and I love it.

146
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,340
They just, they just announced too that you can buy the Nexus Red phone from the Google

147
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,920
Play Store and put it on Ting.

148
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Just get the Ting.

149
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Oh, that's cool.

150
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
Yeah.

151
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
You know what's, you know what's actually really cool?

152
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,800
This, here's a, so not only do they have, not only are they like really savvy about

153
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,840
the net in general, but if I go over to their Google Plus page, I'm going to wait for this

154
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,900
bad boy to load up, they check out, here's how they, here's how they posted it.

155
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,120
This is on their Google Plus page.

156
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
Okay.

157
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
So they did this on social media.

158
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
Cool.

159
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,800
We're now selling the Nexus 5, but please don't buy it from us.

160
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,440
Order it on Google Play and save yourself 95 bucks.

161
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Okay.

162
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
Let me get this straight.

163
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,520
So they not only said, Hey look, you know, we want you to, we want you to put the money

164
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,520
back in your pocket and not in ours, but they're going to actually even provide you where to

165
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
go and do that.

166
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,520
I mean, that's really cool.

167
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,720
Here's their, here's their announcement on a fight against mass surveillance.

168
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,080
Help spread the word by sharing our blog posts and signing the official petition for every

169
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,480
share before the end of the day.

170
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,040
We're donating a dollar to the Electronic Frontier Foundation up to a maximum of $10,000.

171
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
Wow.

172
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,920
So go over to linux.ting.com.

173
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,800
See this is why I've always talked about vote with your wallet, support these kinds of companies.

174
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,000
And you know, we also had a listener reach out to them and ask them about Ubuntu Touch

175
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,640
and they said they're eagerly following that project.

176
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
So they're really kind of onto all of this stuff.

177
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,160
And I think you could go check them out, try out their savings calculator.

178
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,720
They just lowered their data rates.

179
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,640
Try the calculator again, see if it's even more of a deal for you than before.

180
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:21,060
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for being so damn awesome.

181
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,060
That's really cool.

182
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,060
Good guys.

183
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,060
Good stuff.

184
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,060
All right.

185
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,060
Let's jump in the mumble room.

186
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,060
Bring in the guys.

187
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,080
Um, guys, we got a couple of, uh, we got a couple of things I want to, I want to hammer

188
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,480
through before we jump into the, uh, to the Debian topic.

189
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,720
I want to read some of our feedback, but you guys feel free to chime in on any of the feedback

190
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
too.

191
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
All right.

192
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Our first email came from Dalek.

193
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
Hmm.

194
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Dalek, huh?

195
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Interesting.

196
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,920
He says, Hey Chris, I just wanted to comment on your recent snafu on last and your comments

197
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,600
in Coder Radio and Linux unplugged.

198
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,360
I gathered your report on something incorrectly and someone complained on Google Plus.

199
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,840
This was a, we mentioned that we, I reported that the KD Plasma next dates were firm when

200
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
they weren't.

201
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,400
I said, get over it.

202
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,440
He says to me, the only things that matter are number one, you owned up to it when you

203
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,160
found out that you were wrong.

204
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,560
It wasn't intentional and you're taking steps to address the issue.

205
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,360
If you made a, you have made a pledge to be more accurate and to me that is all that matters.

206
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,920
Mistakes can and will happen.

207
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,240
It is what you do about them that makes all the difference.

208
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,240
This is my opinion and I will probably get trolled for saying this, but you're doing

209
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,040
the KD project a favor by reporting on anything on the project.

210
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,560
Instead of hitting Google Plus to complain, they should come directly to you and say,

211
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,600
Hey Chris, you got this part wrong and you should probably fix it.

212
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,040
Oh, and by the way, insert a link here.

213
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,080
This is where the post about info that's correct is happening at.

214
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,680
I definitely agree with the latter part especially.

215
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,600
I think definitely going straight to the source versus a publicly bemoaning crap is definitely

216
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
the way to handle something.

217
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
Yeah, for sure.

218
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,520
Although sometimes, yeah, yeah, I mean, I don't know, see, here's where I fall down

219
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,200
on this is I kind of, I've been thinking about this a lot and I think mistakes will inevitably

220
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,720
happen because there's not a ton of original reporting happening in the Linux and open

221
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,720
source landscape.

222
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,440
A lot of it is blogs, it's rewrites of mailing list posts, it's pulling out company announcements

223
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,640
and then posting them online and then people either do meta coverage of them or they go

224
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,840
do some research on their own and do some, it's very little actual original reporting.

225
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,840
So when you are trying to do some original reporting or trying to just cover some of

226
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,760
the original reporting, there inevitably will be some errors that crop up just because that's

227
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
human nature.

228
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
Sure.

229
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:31,240
And I think as long as, we always try to follow up and make corrections in this show and I

230
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,680
think if the mistake is big enough, we make corrections in the main show itself and we're

231
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,120
very clear and open about it and plus in the subreddit, we get caught pretty quickly.

232
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,040
And I think as long as, one of the things about a podcast is you make it consumable

233
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,780
for one episode if somebody is just doing a drive by and they pick it up.

234
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,920
But what you really want to do is curate a long term community that can depend on quality

235
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,960
of content.

236
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,320
And I think as long as we're addressing that by continuing to do corrections and updates

237
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,520
down the road, then that audience is served in the long run and I think that's what really

238
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,520
matters.

239
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,920
So I'm always going to do my best not to have mistakes but when they do, I'll also always

240
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,680
do my best to make corrections.

241
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,200
And I think that's all you can really do.

242
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Yeah.

243
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Yeah.

244
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,520
Alright, well next bit of feedback comes in and this is from Red Hands Guitar.

245
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,520
Read Hands Guitar.

246
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,520
Read Hands Guitar.

247
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
Ah, well I'll get it eventually.

248
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,800
Give me about four more tries.

249
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,920
He says, he says, he's following up on an email we got at the end of Linux Unplugged

250
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,760
last week and the emailer said, hey, you know what, maybe I prefer Linux not to have that

251
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
big of an adoption.

252
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Let's keep it tight and small.

253
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,760
Right?

254
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,760
Make it a small community.

255
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,760
Maybe it doesn't need to go out to the masses.

256
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,440
And I think we all kind of kicked around and said, nah, to really be successful we need

257
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,680
to get a wider adoption.

258
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,360
He said, so Read Hands Guitar says, I think it would be, I think I would be satisfied

259
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,920
if Linux became as popular as the desktop OS as Mac OS is, but maybe even more would

260
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
be better.

261
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,680
I think the most beneficial kind of growth initially is to allow other kinds of growth

262
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,200
by hobbyist users, so we start there.

263
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,840
If we have a huge influx of hobbyists who can commit code, Linux and free software become

264
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,080
better products and give better impressions to more casual users.

265
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,880
I agree up until the last point.

266
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,560
The last point, generally speaking, the more coding and the more coders and things you

267
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:17,120
come into it, you do end up with better stuff, but a lot of times little things like UX and

268
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,240
stuff like that tend to go out the window, especially in the Linux space, so I don't

269
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
know.

270
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Maybe so.

271
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
Yeah.

272
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:34,040
See, I do kind of, I see some aspects of like, sometimes if you build something for the geeks,

273
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,480
that serves a point, that serves a purpose for a while.

274
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,840
That does help with getting you to a level of adoption on a class of user, a lot of times

275
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
it's sort of the trendsetter.

276
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,760
You know, Matt, one of the things that I know, I'm sure you must have noticed too, over the

277
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,800
last 20 years maybe, let's say, is like there used to be a day in an age when I would go

278
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,240
to a restaurant and if somebody dropped a computer term like modem or windows, I would

279
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,540
immediately pick that sucker up and be like, whoa, somebody just said something about a

280
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,640
computer in a public place.

281
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,280
And now these days, it's common vernacular to be throwing out, you know, Facebook, dot

282
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,560
com, Twitter, whatever, right?

283
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,240
So I think in some ways you could argue that the internet used to be a place only for the

284
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,360
geeks that eventually, because of the work they did and then the work to bring other

285
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,560
people to it, eventually it became appealing to the common person.

286
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,720
And I think the Linux desktop could be like that and the Linux desktop shares a lot of

287
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,400
similarities with the development of the internet in some ways.

288
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,760
The fractured nature of it, right?

289
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,920
The competing standards, all these things, but eventually it all sort of moves forward

290
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,560
as one big evolutionary organic beast and I kind of feel like in a way this phase the

291
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,320
Linux desktop is at right now could be its glory days in a sense where it's for the geeks,

292
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,040
it's really great if you're a nerd and you really want to tinker with your system and

293
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,560
you look at sort of the Ubuntuization of a desktop where they're putting a lot more polish

294
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,200
on there, they're changing things, polish might not be the right word, but they're

295
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,560
packaging and productizing it, going with their own display server because that fits

296
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,800
the needs of the product, not because it might technically be the better thing for everyone

297
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,000
in the community, but it helps them create a product that is good for general consumers

298
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,680
and so they're going that direction.

299
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,840
I think what Canonical and Ubuntu are doing right now is going to be the leading edge

300
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,360
of what's going to happen in a lot of products using Linux.

301
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,480
I think that's one way Linux will be brought to a lot more people.

302
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,720
It might not be that everybody has a big tower PC with a monitor and a keyboard and a mouse

303
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,160
hooked up to it and an Ethernet jack and power and all this kind of stuff, it might be tablets

304
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,640
and it might be Nest thermostats and it might be robots hooked into your Google Plus account

305
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,840
and all these kinds of things that are running Linux and eventually everyone will be using

306
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:56,400
Linux in every single way, it just might not be in the exact vision we have today.

307
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,120
That's a good point and I think in many ways we're already well into that direction as

308
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,680
it is, especially in the embedded markets and things like that, because I think the

309
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,640
desktop market is such a tough – it's like whack-a-mole in so many ways trying to

310
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,120
find that perfect sweet spot to where the market is saying, we don't care if it runs

311
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,400
Cheetos, we just want to make sure that it's accomplishing the tasks that I want to do.

312
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,480
Right, look at the huge success of Chromebooks now, right?

313
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,520
Yeah, exactly, because it accomplishes tasks versus what display server does it run and

314
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
whatnot.

315
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,320
I think what display server and that sort of thing, that stuff matters, but it matters

316
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,760
to a very compartmentalized group of people.

317
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,040
To people such as myself, I care, but getting someone like my wife or someone else to care,

318
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
that's a little bit tougher.

319
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,000
So it's going to be an interesting divide until we can begin to smooth out those edges

320
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I think.

321
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yeah.

322
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,800
Well, when we move forward, one weird crazy device at a time that we all think is going

323
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,240
to fail until it doesn't like Chromebooks, you know what I mean?

324
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,320
I honestly was a big Chromebook hater.

325
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,720
I still think it's a little wonky.

326
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,360
I tried it, but you know what, the market speaks, and I think a lot of it's price based,

327
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
but yeah.

328
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
I think they're cute.

329
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,800
I mean, I think they're like the ideal, I don't know, college student, teenager kind

330
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
of thing.

331
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
I mean, I think they're great for that.

332
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,840
It's like you drop it, you shrug, and you go buy a new one.

333
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:17,840
I think the Chromebook shows a version though where it's not just the DVR or the closed

334
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,600
camera system like who me is saying, it's like it's all devices.

335
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,600
All consumer devices, because it seems like you look at, we just had a really great chat

336
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,040
on Coderadio yesterday about how what Microsoft is really up against is their whole model

337
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,600
is software licensing, and that is completely vanishing.

338
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,360
Subscription models, reoccurring subscription models where it's essentially a license and

339
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,600
you're getting access to the program like Adobe Creative Cloud or Office 365, but selling

340
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,360
somebody an $80 OEM license when they go to build a product, that's going to go away.

341
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,240
We speculated about perhaps even Windows going completely free at some point in the next

342
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,780
year or two, especially with this new CEO stepping in.

343
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,800
And I think if they don't, there's really going to be no reason people don't use these

344
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,000
free operating systems when they just need a base level OS and they're building on top

345
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
of that.

346
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,960
You know, when you look at Chromebooks, right?

347
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Exactly.

348
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,480
Well, and I'm not super familiar with Windows 8, so I'm going to go out on a limb and say,

349
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,280
I assume that Microsoft still makes their business out of selling stickers, you know,

350
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,600
the little licensing stickers they like to put on computers.

351
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,840
You know, they are the biggest sticker based business I've ever seen.

352
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,040
And so if you lose that sticker, your CD becomes a coaster.

353
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:33,440
And I think they need to realize that that model is not only the worst customer experience

354
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,640
possible, but as you pointed out, it's not going to work.

355
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,760
Let's get out of stickers and let's, you know, maybe they can look into, I don't know, opening

356
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,880
up a nice pub or something.

357
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:49,320
So what really helped Windows back in the day was they had a really kind of good relationship

358
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,480
between their desktop product and their server products.

359
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,820
So if you ran, and that drove a lot of people to run Windows server and Windows desktops

360
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,720
in the business, which then drove a lot of people to buy Windows in the home because

361
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,240
they wanted to use what they're familiar with work.

362
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,560
You know, I remember my stepdad specifically didn't want to buy a Mac, didn't want to

363
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,760
use Ubuntu because the job he was working at used Windows XP and that's what he wanted.

364
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,040
He wanted to use exactly what they used at work at home.

365
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,960
That way he wouldn't have a problem at all.

366
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,560
And you know, to be frank, I understood the logic there.

367
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:23,600
I felt like, okay, I can totally empathize with that when you're not very comfortable

368
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,700
with computers.

369
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,240
And so in a sense, that's going away now with the whole bring your own device initiative

370
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,720
and a lot of those devices are Linux powered, primarily through Android and things like

371
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
that.

372
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,440
So Microsoft is transitioning to this whole cloud infrastructure, Azure, Office 365 subscription

373
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,200
models, and you know, also attempting to do the devices thing.

374
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,720
But the problem is Linux is already there on both fronts, on the cloud front and on

375
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,200
the devices front and not just like a little bit, right?

376
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Like it's dominant, like it's the boss there.

377
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,840
And so they are really going to be up.

378
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,480
This new CEO has a ton of work and I wonder if because Linux is already the boss on the

379
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,400
server space, it's already the boss on the device space, if you almost have that same

380
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,720
thing again where, well, because we run it on the server and because I have it on my

381
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,800
devices, I'm also going to put it on these other devices.

382
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,920
And just for developers and for companies that are just trying to wrap their head around

383
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,280
products and delivering a decent product, it almost just makes it easier for them to

384
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,560
just put everything Linux because, well, we're already using that on the servers over here,

385
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,440
we're writing code for that, we're already shipping these Android devices, we're writing

386
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
code for that.

387
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,440
So you know what?

388
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,000
Let's just make it all Linux.

389
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,360
And I think that's sort of the thing we could be seeing put in place right now.

390
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,960
I think we're seeing that and that is what Microsoft's up against and it's like this

391
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,260
silent monster.

392
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,520
It's not this big company, it doesn't have any one particular logo on it, but it's still

393
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,940
this massive battle that I don't think they're fully equipped to fight.

394
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,960
They're equipped to fight IBM's and Apple's and Oracle's, right?

395
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,320
That's who Microsoft is armed to fight.

396
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,880
Microsoft, in my opinion, is going to continue to eat their own face when it comes to the

397
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,040
consumer market.

398
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,000
They hired who seems to be a really nice guy.

399
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,120
I'm sure he's going to really means well and is going to do his very best and I'm sure

400
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
he's great.

401
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,440
I don't think that, but they continue to make the same mistake they've always made and that's,

402
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,200
oh, why bring in someone new that might be able to help us in our shortcomings when we

403
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,440
can hire someone from within again?

404
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,200
Granted, he's got some great skill sets and like I said, I'm sure he's very talented,

405
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,840
but it's the bigger problems they're still hiring within.

406
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,840
They really do.

407
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,480
They need somebody to go and do some weed whacking.

408
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,800
Now, Bacon Drinker, you were going to make a point that you think if Windows goes free,

409
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
it's better for Linux?

410
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,440
No, it's worse for Linux, sorry.

411
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,760
Oh, it's worse for Linux.

412
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,760
Tell me.

413
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,960
You think people will do…

414
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
It's the web browser model.

415
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,960
You say like, well, the web browser idea is to say like, when a web browser is, when you

416
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,560
see someone running IE, you switch them to Chrome or when someone's PC breaks and you

417
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,960
reinstall it, you switch them to Chrome.

418
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,240
Well, if someone's PC breaks, you haven't got the moral problem of torrenting Windows,

419
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,200
so you're probably going to install Windows for free anyway.

420
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,600
Yeah, but who's going to want to run Metro on it?

421
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,520
I mean, you know, I think Microsoft is solving that problem for us.

422
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,080
I think they are going to, I think web applications, HTML5, that kind of crap, the crap that we

423
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,620
all hate hearing the buzz terms about, are making Windows less relevant and I think Microsoft

424
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:11,200
is doing us all a favor by making Windows less relevant.

425
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:18,120
Paul Thrott over at winsupersite.com ran a story, I think, I can't remember what the

426
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,920
title was, but it was a good title, and he makes the case that he goes through and lists

427
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,520
all of the people that have lost their jobs, the entire divisions that they've done house

428
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,240
cleanings on, and he even proposes Balmer's loss of his job is because of what a catastrophe

429
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,960
Windows 8 is, and he writes, he says, he's talked to people in there that, you know,

430
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,120
they think it's worse than Vista, and they think, not in terms of sales, but in terms

431
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,640
of public image, and they think that they may have set Windows back a decade, is the

432
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,000
term they're using internally, that Windows has been set back a decade.

433
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Ouch.

434
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah.

435
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Not shocking, but ouch.

436
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,400
That's, that's pretty, you know, that's pretty damning.

437
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,720
And so some people are speculating now pretty openly, well Paul Thrott is the person I'm

438
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,160
talking about, but other people as well that, you know, maybe this, maybe the reason why

439
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,560
they went with Satya Nadella, I think is how you say the last name, Satya Nadella, is because

440
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,240
they just really have to double down and focus on no longer making Windows the center of

441
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
the Microsoft folks.

442
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,600
Remember back, I think we all remember that quote for Balmer saying, Windows is the future

443
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
of Microsoft.

444
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,360
Hey, we want to make an Xbox, you put Windows on it.

445
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,920
Hey, you want to make a device, put Windows on it.

446
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,960
Hey, you need that servers, doing something, put Windows on it, and then load SQL on it.

447
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,120
You got yourself a winning combo everybody.

448
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,640
And it was Windows this, Windows that, Windows this, Windows that.

449
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,920
Now it's all going to be about these reoccurring subscriptions, this Office 365, Azure, and

450
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
all these things.

451
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,280
But the problem with these is they inherently have a very high run cost.

452
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:44,420
And while that might work good in the rich Western worlds, it's not going to work good

453
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,440
in some of the poorer places in this world.

454
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,360
And it's never going to lock them in as a dominant force.

455
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,320
They're never going to be number one in cloud hosted services.

456
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,360
That's already been claimed really.

457
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,800
And they do it to themselves too.

458
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,520
It's like if you look at Office 365, which I've had some limited experience with, it's

459
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,800
been a couple of months, but when I looked at it, I'm thinking, okay, so compared to

460
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:08,140
the Google offerings, which are free, you want me to pay for something that for a non-enterprise

461
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:14,640
user isn't really compellingly different other than maybe visually different.

462
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,720
They seem to shoot themselves in the foot as soon as they launch something like that.

463
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:21,800
They launch these products and say, okay, how can we either overbrand it with too many

464
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,680
versions, charge something when quite frankly no one's going to pay for it, not out of

465
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,200
the enterprise anyway, and what the hell?

466
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
Their thinking doesn't make any sense.

467
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Yeah.

468
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
It's like a lack of focus.

469
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
I agree.

470
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
It really is.

471
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Craig.

472
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,400
We're also ignoring something kind of important that people will just use Windows because

473
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,880
they know Windows.

474
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,880
Yeah.

475
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,560
I've seen that change more and more though.

476
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,120
That is until they have a reason not to, and there's going to be a thousand different reasons

477
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
not to, I think.

478
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,000
Even if it's like tablets, right?

479
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,940
If you shift, if you're an average user and you shift 70% of your computing workload over

480
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:00,680
to a tablet when you're at home, like reading email, checking Facebook, all of these things,

481
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,600
tablets actually in some ways better at really.

482
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,480
So isn't that a loss for Microsoft?

483
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Just right there?

484
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,040
Even if people are just using the Windows desktop 70% less of the time?

485
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,760
Well, not just that, but I also know of three computer technicians here in town, one of

486
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:22,200
them who's a pretty big player, is tired of offering Microsoft's only solutions and has

487
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,400
now begun offering some Linux solutions.

488
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,920
He's not going to say this publicly because he has a Microsoft agreement, but the point

489
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,160
is that this is happening and he's actually, a lot of people are saying, oh, okay, well,

490
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,680
I want to do Windows 7 or Windows 8.

491
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,680
Oh, I have old hardware.

492
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,680
Oops, sorry, I'm screwed.

493
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,360
I've got to buy new peripherals because nothing's supported.

494
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,700
And so it's becoming a value proposition for him to offer them an operating system he can

495
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,280
still support and not look like a douchebag.

496
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,880
So and then tablets and things, that's more of a younger audience.

497
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,160
There's a pretty much 45 and up.

498
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,160
I don't know.

499
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,400
I think seniors, I think there's a pretty good use case and I say that because in our

500
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:03,680
own family, some of the older folks who had computer phobias, the family got them tablets

501
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,680
and they've really taken them.

502
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,920
And one of the things like on the Kindles that they really like is they can really increase

503
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,920
the size of the text.

504
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,200
So it makes it a lot easier for them to read.

505
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,440
Kindle fires have been pretty good.

506
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
Yeah, I've seen a few.

507
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,040
You know, my grandma hasn't had a computer her entire life and now is on email all the

508
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,600
time and she's emailing with the church group and constantly on the thing.

509
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
I mean, she's like.

510
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:28,680
So for her, and it wasn't just her, it was also several family members who were just

511
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:33,680
anti-technology, but once they got their hands on one, gosh, you know, it really was like

512
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,760
a pretty big transformation for them.

513
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
So I don't know.

514
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,640
And perhaps the other value for the family members too is that you're no longer, you

515
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,560
don't feel like you have to be afraid of it anymore, like you did with the Windows box.

516
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,880
Right, you're not worried about the malware, and it's so dead simple, it's like you just

517
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
turn it on, right?

518
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,520
You just turn it on and push the mail icon.

519
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,840
And honestly, for some of these people, like the barrier was the mouse, like they just

520
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
didn't know how to use a mouse.

521
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,680
Now they can touch the thing.

522
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,320
But Craig, you were going to make a point that it's convergence that's doing Windows

523
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
8.

524
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,120
Yeah, what I've seen while I worked at Memory Express was that the biggest issues with most

525
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,600
customers computers were that they didn't know how to use Windows 8 and that when they

526
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,460
went from a tablet to Windows 8, it still wasn't the same, even though they're made

527
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,840
the same.

528
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,360
And there's just a whole bunch of issues with people learning the new OS and they're

529
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,480
shooting themselves in the foot by making it too different without leaving in some key

530
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,200
information that helps people transition.

531
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,640
And by having a cell phone that acts like a tablet and a tablet that acts like a computer

532
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,680
is just confusing people even more.

533
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:43,520
Yeah, I think they didn't go far enough, like in the sense, like I think maybe the work

534
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:51,160
that's being done now by folks to have that device more like role change and then try

535
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,840
to be the same thing all the time.

536
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,040
I think that's probably the more winning recipe.

537
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,480
And it also makes more sense as devices get more powerful, they can afford to do that.

538
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
You know what I'm talking?

539
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,680
Like you put in a dock hooked up to a computer, you get a desktop UI.

540
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:09,800
I think the biggest problem is the model of quote convergence they went with.

541
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:14,920
In article they're going with a fairly similar UI and with Unity 8 applications should be

542
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,880
able to run across the different platforms.

543
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,120
The KDE plasma interface, you have the plasma that you have on the desktop, they'll be your

544
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,920
main plasma interface on a tablet.

545
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:31,480
Yeah, there's plasma active which is definitely very plasma driven and then the idea there

546
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:36,880
just like with Unity 8 would be that it would switch and I think as long, I think what we

547
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,280
are all worried about in those scenarios is that the applications in desktop mode will

548
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,280
feel like mobile applications and I think that's maybe almost impossible to avoid for

549
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,640
the first year or so as developers are just working on this stuff, adding features and

550
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,800
changing things based on user feedback because sometimes you just don't know until a couple

551
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,680
thousand people have banged on it for a while.

552
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:02,120
Sorry, I think the death of Windows 8 was in the desktop, not the tablet.

553
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,000
Yeah, for sure, yeah, absolutely.

554
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,480
Because if you look back at it, the uproar was really not being able to access the start

555
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
menu.

556
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,360
No, actually people are pretty positive about it in the mobile sense.

557
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,360
People love the tiles.

558
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,360
Ooh, the tiles.

559
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,240
Yeah, I definitely would say that when I was experiencing it and then listening to other

560
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,800
people talk about it, they loved it.

561
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Some of the lower end Windows tablets, they weren't real impressed with the performance

562
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,320
in comparison to other tablets but they did like the layout.

563
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,840
They felt it was easy to navigate but yeah, the desktop was a boy.

564
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,840
That's a mess.

565
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,120
All right, we got one more.

566
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,960
I think a KDE tablet would own them all for looks.

567
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
We will see.

568
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
We'll see.

569
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,080
Stay tuned and find out.

570
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,360
All right, so one bit of feedback.

571
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,320
Speaking of desktops, this is our last bit.

572
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,400
The traditional desktop, Voodoo 6, who says he was going to make it this week but I don't

573
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,400
see him in here.

574
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,200
He says, I've made fun of Mate in the past and now I feel kind of bad about it.

575
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,440
I listened to the show and decided to go grab the live CD and give it a run in VirtualBox

576
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,080
and I have to say I'm pretty impressed.

577
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,640
They've actually come a long way with Mate and made some improvements in all the right

578
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,040
places and also holy hell is it fast.

579
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,680
Even running from a live CD in VirtualBox with compositing enabled, it just zipped right

580
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:14,760
along and then later on, he said, I went ahead and set it up on one of my workstations and

581
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
I've been using it all morning.

582
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,760
It's really good stuff.

583
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,040
I felt like my opinion about the Mate desktop was changed during last week's episode too.

584
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,680
So it's cool to see that some of the folks in the audience felt that way.

585
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,720
All right, Matt, well before we jump into the Debian stuff and this is why we have a

586
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,800
big mumble room today, we got a lot of folks in there.

587
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,000
I think people have been following this topic with quite an interest and it's been one of

588
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,100
these things that has just, I mean it's been like, you could have sports commentary doing

589
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,660
a live stream of this at some point.

590
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,680
It has really just been a heck of a thing to watch.

591
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,520
So before we get to that, I want to thank DigitalOcean, our sponsor for this week's

592
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,120
episode of Linux Unplugged.

593
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,480
DigitalOcean is so great.

594
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,760
It's simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up

595
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,160
a cloud server.

596
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,800
These things are so super quick.

597
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,880
Users can create a cloud server in about 55 seconds.

598
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,040
I got it down to 47 seconds.

599
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,880
I believe, what, our record right now, was it 44 seconds?

600
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,880
Was that what it was?

601
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,880
I haven't seen that beat.

602
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,880
I think it was.

603
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,880
I think it was 44 because I think you had the record previously.

604
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,880
I did.

605
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,960
Now I kind of want to create another one just so I can try to beat 44 seconds.

606
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,960
I think I can do it.

607
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,080
I think I can do it because I'm getting the UI down.

608
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,680
It's so simple and intuitive.

609
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,080
I kind of just know where to go without even looking.

610
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,480
I could do it without even, with like one mouse tight, I don't know.

611
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,800
Anyways, DigitalOcean, check this out.

612
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,240
A little bit of an announcement here.

613
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,360
DigitalOcean has locations in New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam, and now Singapore.

614
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,120
They just added Singapore today, so congratulations to DigitalOcean.

615
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
Here's what's great.

616
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,960
Users, while you're over there and you can spin up this cloud server in 55 seconds, that's

617
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
awesome, right?

618
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Sure, that's good.

619
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,560
But check out what you get for $5.

620
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
You ready for this?

621
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,680
If you're a user of DigitalOcean for $5, you're going to get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte

622
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,240
SSD, a CPU, and one terabyte of transfer.

623
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,040
A terabyte of transfer is really quite a bit, and I love that it's a fixed cost.

624
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,920
Boom, I know exactly what I'm going to get, so you got to go check them out.

625
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,120
Just for their intuitive control panel, and they also allow you to replicate it on a much

626
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,400
larger scale with a really straightforward API.

627
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,680
So go over to DigitalOcean.com and check them out.

628
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,920
They got a great droplet system with images that are all ready to go.

629
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,240
You can pay by the hour if you just want to do testing for a little bit, tons of really

630
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,400
great features, and Linux fans, which I think you might be, will appreciate that they're

631
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,600
doing this all on top of KVM.

632
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:29,560
This is a great example of how Linux empowers a company to do a whole new category of product

633
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,480
that just a few years ago wasn't even possible.

634
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,940
This is just they're taking advantage of technology built into Linux.

635
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:41,740
They're using great hardware, tier one bandwidth, and it really just all comes together.

636
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:46,120
This is the kind of stuff as we're about to start talking about system D here in a little

637
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
bit.

638
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,680
It's this kind of stuff that when these distributions make these underlying infrastructure changes

639
00:31:51,680 --> 00:32:00,200
it has such wide reaching impacts, such ramifications, and the implementation of KVM into the Linux

640
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
kernel.

641
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,040
This is a great example of how something just blew up a whole new industry that is now providing

642
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,360
a whole new level of service at a whole new price never possible for, and what's even

643
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,660
better is you can get it for free for two months.

644
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:19,440
If you use our promo code LINUXUNPLUGGEDFEBRUARY when you check out Linux Unplugged February,

645
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,080
all one word will get you a $10 digital ocean credit.

646
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,800
You can use that $5 server for two months.

647
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,620
I've been running that $5 server for a while now and it just, man, Linux performs like

648
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,440
a champ and you combine it with those SSDs and their bandwidth, man it flies.

649
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,720
It's so great.

650
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,920
And the fact you can actually if you want to like say bang out an arch server, you can

651
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,720
and it's super fast, it's easy, what a great place to, it's like oh I wonder, I've heard

652
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,160
some things about this package, I've heard it enhances or hinders something, I can try

653
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,160
it out on the server.

654
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,220
It's like oh that's what it does.

655
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,960
You know without actually having to do anything locally.

656
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
It's great.

657
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,600
They're big fans of the Docker project too.

658
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,440
They're always really staying in sync with that project.

659
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,360
They're making it so awesome to deploy applications up on the server.

660
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
It's really cool.

661
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
So go check them out.

662
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,280
DigitalOcean.com, promo code LINUXUNPLUGGEDFEBRUARY and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for their

663
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,160
awesome support of Linux Unplugged.

664
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
Okay.

665
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:12,680
So, Ron do you want to start by bringing us up to date on, is he in here, Ron are you?

666
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,760
Yeah, Ron do you want to start by bringing us up to date on kind of where we're at right

667
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,240
now with the Debian init system because I got to be honest, I got to make a disclaimer.

668
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,600
After Sunday came around and we kind of looked like we were locked into system D, I sort

669
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,480
of stopped carrying a little bit just because it seemed like a lot of drama was, it seemed

670
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,040
like things were getting a little nasty, a little personal.

671
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,920
So what's happened in the last couple of days since like say Sunday, Rod?

672
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:42,840
Well the main issue is that they've kind of officially decided that system D is what they're

673
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:50,200
going with and the drama started with Ian kind of calling for a vote for BDale to be

674
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
pulled down as chairman.

675
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,840
That kind of pretty much backfired in him and people were starting to say that he needs

676
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,920
to be taken out of the TC.

677
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:05,160
So to kind of stave off that, right the technical committee, he decided to stave off that happening.

678
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:10,920
He kind of voluntarily is taking a break for a couple of days he said and then as soon

679
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:16,820
as that happened the next day BDale cast his vote which kind of solidified system D being

680
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,820
the choice.

681
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:23,940
And if I'm correct, tell me if I'm not, BDale because he's chair, in the case of a tie,

682
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,860
his vote counts as two votes.

683
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,600
So it'd be two votes for system D if there's a tie, right?

684
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,160
Anybody else know if that's true or not?

685
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:38,360
Well, I'm pretty sure it's something like that but it wasn't necessary because basically

686
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,880
Ian pulled himself out of voting.

687
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:45,320
And this is kind of interesting voluntarily standing down now, is that because did you

688
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,460
guys get the impression that's because people were accusing him of having some sort of ulterior

689
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,460
motive here?

690
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,760
What was the what was the reason for the step aside just because emotions were getting flaring

691
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
up and things like that?

692
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,160
It was getting really heated.

693
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,480
So whether that's why or not but essentially when he called for the BDale to be dropped

694
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,920
down, I think three people called for him to be kicked out.

695
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,920
Wow.

696
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,120
Okay, so I here's this is kind of stuff I just I'm not really that big on following

697
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,960
but I just wanted to sort of set up what's been going on so that way people have some

698
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,200
context of sort of the you know the scope of this decision that apparently is it's really

699
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,080
weighing on the on the Debian project here and what has really struck me on the onset

700
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:33,040
of all this is how it all seemed like a foregone conclusion to me and I think this is part

701
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,320
of why I've been so frustrated with this whole thing because technically speaking system

702
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,200
D seems like just from a pure technical standpoint the superior solution but then when you also

703
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,440
consider the things like the CLA and other and other problems that would be introduced

704
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,960
that also seems like it clearly eliminates upstart unless they want to take on some sort

705
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,960
of fork and then you look at other solutions like open RC that have a lot of critics it

706
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,000
always seemed like system D was the proper choice and the fact that system D is already

707
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,360
available in Debian testing seemed like it made it the obvious choice.

708
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,160
So what the hell what the hell am I not seeing here what am I not getting what is it what

709
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,920
is it they have been debating over what has been the big roadblock here for them making

710
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,680
a decision on this kind of thing and the reason why I almost sound a little upset is because

711
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,640
it's almost getting a little embarrassing at this point.

712
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,640
It's Debian though.

713
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,700
Well well it's pretty much done now it seems but they I'd say the only thing they were

714
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:37,040
really arguing over is the well two things is the CLA and the other kernel connection

715
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,920
which basically system D breaks that.

716
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:46,200
I guess what I'm worried about is this are we watching sort of the are we watching Debian

717
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,560
become an ineffective project or has it always been this bad and this is just sort of the

718
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,320
recent thing that highlights it I guess is that does that seem like a fair question?

719
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,600
Well I think it is I think you've mentioned before in the past that you know these type

720
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,840
of debates and discussions have pretty much always happened inside you know different

721
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:08,080
Linux communities but now with so many different mailing lists and people looking to put out

722
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,440
news articles the moment something gets said it gets repeated around so many times.

723
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:19,440
So I think it's just as you've stated in the past the speed at which we now broadcast this

724
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,800
these discussions and these disagreements has grown so much that now it seems like it's

725
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,720
worse than I believe it really is.

726
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,400
Yeah it's basically the same for it's been like the same for the past five years at least

727
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,400
that I can remember.

728
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
This one seems particularly bad though.

729
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,160
But it just didn't get as heated.

730
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,520
I think maybe that's why it's gotten the coverage it has and it's not just news outlets anymore

731
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,520
it's just general interested bystanders are tweeting out links to the mailing list it's

732
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,240
every every major new post is you know there's four posts of it to reddit.

733
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,400
Daredevil I want to give you a chance to chime in here what do you think?

734
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:56,840
You know what I was about just to say is that pretty much the discussions on the mailing

735
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:02,000
list is always a slow communication medium and until getting that it's just a matter

736
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,160
of we're constantly looking because it's an interesting project that's it.

737
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:14,520
But other decisions on Debian have been always sort of posing ethical and technical questions

738
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,000
they don't focus on only on the technical side.

739
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,040
Crossroads do you think this is a lack of focus problem?

740
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,360
I mean yeah I think that they want to I think that they want Debian to be available to as

741
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:32,000
many people as possible so they want it to even be available on the on the BSD and systems

742
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,520
and system D requires C groups that they won't run on BSD.

743
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,280
Popeye is our resident upstart fan I'm always interested to hear what you think.

744
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,200
I wouldn't say I'm necessarily an upstart fan.

745
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,520
I'm just poking.

746
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:52,520
Yeah I know I'm not so sure I mean I mentioned last time that there's more eyeballs on this

747
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:57,880
partly because you know there's more eyeballs on everything because of social media and

748
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:03,280
everyone wanting instant updates on everything and everyone reporting everything pretty quickly

749
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:09,060
after the event occurs and keeping an eye on mailing lists and that becomes news.

750
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:14,320
But also don't forget the other side which is a positive side Debian is much more popular

751
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,760
and much more heavily used than it ever was before so any of these discussions that happened

752
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,560
on a random Debian mailing list the only people who are interested were nerds whereas now

753
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:30,840
you've got Ubuntu users, Mint users, system D developers, Fedora users, Red Hat users,

754
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,360
all these people who are interested in Debian.

755
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,660
So there's a lot of focus on it not just from the media but also from people who have a

756
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,960
vested interest in what goes on in Debian.

757
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,400
I think that is a big point to underscore right there and Bank and Drinker you sounded

758
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,920
like you had a kind of a perspective from a new Linux user is this look like insanity

759
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,920
from the outside?

760
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,400
No it sort of looks like it's been overblown so the way I look at it is from what I can

761
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,800
see from a newbies perspective it sort of doesn't matter as much as it's been shown

762
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,880
us because from what I can see if system D isn't your thing you can just install upstart

763
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,880
or open RC.

764
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,320
Yeah I think you know I think this is part of I think there's I almost feel like there

765
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,920
was a bigger decision being made in a sense at the same time they were picking the init

766
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,680
system and I feel like that decision was do we want to unify a great part of the core

767
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,120
of Linux in a sense and some people feel like in part of doing that we're throwing out a

768
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:29,480
bit of the Unix philosophy and there's this constant reevaluation in the Linux community

769
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:35,960
about the our Unix roots versus practical needs and I feel like that was the meta discussion

770
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,400
being had and perhaps that's why the interest was so intense and the Debian committee technical

771
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,120
committee and the other Debian developers maybe felt the weight of that meta discussion

772
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,120
what do you guys think?

773
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:51,640
I also think sorry that it was a lot of it was emotion to be honest it was quite an emotional

774
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,240
discussion more than the technical one.

775
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,040
Go ahead Poppy.

776
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:01,760
Russ Albury posted a lengthy mail recently which kind of sought to explain some of the

777
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,000
stuff that went on on the list on the technical committee and the fact that these guys are

778
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,240
all friends and they get on fairly well and maybe people's perspective from the outside

779
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,640
is not the same perspective as those guys on the inside have.

780
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:22,040
Right right yeah that's fair Q5 why don't you chime in I know you had something to say.

781
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:27,800
Yeah I've talked with a lot of people recently about this and I've noticed a trend that there

782
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,040
seem to be a large number of people you were discussing about meta discussions that a lot

783
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,560
of people have become pro System D just because they're against some of the business moves

784
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,640
that Canonical has made and by extension I want to reject Canonical by rejecting Upstart.

785
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,840
So it's like a form of Canonical hate in a sense to just like System D because it's

786
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,840
not Upstart.

787
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:51,120
Yeah I've actually heard that statement from people before regarding System D versus Upstart

788
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:54,880
where people have said you know I don't really know much about System D I just don't want

789
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,200
Upstart to get it because that's what Canonical made.

790
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,600
I guess there's probably always some of that going on and I wonder too like I look at I

791
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:07,160
look at the big like down the road now what these kind of events do is they look really

792
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:12,040
dramatic while they're happening but in a sense I feel like a lot of consensus has been

793
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,920
built around System D now.

794
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,220
Like I think the end result is the rest of the community just had this massive conversation

795
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:23,720
and came to an agreement that they then all exerted upon the Debian community but as a

796
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:28,520
whole collective System D kind of went from this Lenard's interesting thing that he's

797
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:33,940
building for Red Hat to oh yeah this is probably the way that all Linux that can should go

798
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:38,640
but it's not the end of all Linux's that don't and I think I think but I do think it does

799
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,480
underscore this interesting consensus making process that happens as a result of these

800
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,600
big flare ups and in the end result the community the hive mind comes to larger conclusions

801
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,840
what do you think of that?

802
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:58,760
I'm inclined to agree with you and I think there are there's a lot of focus on these

803
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:04,320
things at the time but then later on we we move on like you know who really cares now

804
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,440
that Ubuntu move the buttons to the left hand side who really cares that Ubuntu doesn't

805
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:15,040
have GIMP on the CD who really cares that the CD is the image is over 800 megabytes

806
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:21,280
so only fits on a USB stick at the time these things seem so important it's like the Beatles

807
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,700
or Justin Bieber you know at the time it seems like it's massively important to everyone

808
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:31,040
on the planet right now but you skip skip forward three years and nobody gives a crap.

809
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:37,040
You know my favorite go-to for that is the whole Microsoft Novell deal that like we dedicated

810
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,080
like three weeks of the Linux action show to covering and everybody was ready to burn

811
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,560
Novell at the stake and here we are what three four year five years later and it doesn't

812
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,000
really seem to have made too much of a difference on anything and we were all worried that like

813
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,920
it was had some there was some sort of patent play at it that you know the Samba project

814
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:58,120
was doomed and all these kinds of things that really turned out not to be a big deal.

815
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,280
It's interesting how that comes about in hindsight because I mean at the time yeah that was you

816
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,600
know it was perceived as just like you know the the clouds are turning blood red and the

817
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,000
sun's gonna fall out of the sky and everything and I think the problem with this kind of

818
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,440
consensus building is there are now tools available to manipulate the hive and like

819
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:22,800
sort of and I think I think Lenart and crew kind of comes out looking like the good guys

820
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,120
and not the good guys but kind of look comes out looking better on this whole thing and

821
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,560
and really that was because he was able to go to his own Google Plus feed and have a

822
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:36,600
platform to influence a lot of people and what they were how they how they viewed it

823
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,120
and I think really you really think Lenart comes out being the good guy in this.

824
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:46,080
I do not necessarily in terms of like like like the traditional sense but in terms of

825
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:52,080
like the most logical maybe I don't know like like having the having the clearer perspective

826
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,800
of the group it's not the right way to put either I think I think he comes away looking

827
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,440
like he was he was right in the end maybe is that the way to put it?

828
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,320
So he may well be technically right but I challenge you to go back over the last six

829
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:10,120
months of Google Plus and whatever other mailing lists and find every occasion where Lenart

830
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:15,560
has taken potshots at upstart pointing out bug reports pointing out things that upstart

831
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,880
does or doesn't do.

832
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,880
Now I agree.

833
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,640
Now now now go back and find upstart developers doing the same thing and you know what you

834
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,640
won't find them.

835
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,080
I agree that that's not I don't really mean I don't mean all of that feed I just mean

836
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:30,360
like during the heat of the discussion he's able to go and have a platform that he was

837
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,960
able to influence a lot of people's thinking on the matter I mean I think if you look at

838
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,340
like r slash Linux a lot of people were just repeating things that he posted on his G plus

839
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:43,520
feed as if it was their own ideas and their own concepts and right it reminds me of an

840
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,000
American presidential campaign exactly all these kind of Google Plus messages need to

841
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,840
say underneath my name's Lenart Pottering and I approve of this message right it's that's

842
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,720
exactly what I mean and I think that's why we have to be a little bit worried about this

843
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:01,440
form of consensus building because it is ripe for manipulation and that's my point is that

844
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,600
and I say most of my opinion regarding this matter actually came out of these Linux unplugged

845
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:13,160
discussions and I kind of figured it was either going to be open RC or a system the nothing

846
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:17,520
against canonical nothing against technically against upstart but I don't think they would

847
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,320
have chosen that for the CLA crossroads I want to give you a chance to jump in to

848
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:29,960
I don't really think that anyone came out looking like a good guy because the system

849
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:35,120
D people what like Toby said we're going through and buying the bug reports and I almost looked

850
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,720
petty and an upstart folks were just kind of silent so I don't think when there's this

851
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,760
kind of arguing and this kind of tit for tat stuff if no one looks like a good guy good

852
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,080
guy might not have been the right way to put I was just trying to think of a way to kind

853
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:51,960
of frame it where I think people kind of rallied around the points he was making and kind of

854
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,720
decided to you know to pick up on what he was what he was championing championing well

855
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,760
I think I think he had technical accuracy on his side you know he was he was able to

856
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:06,400
point out the odd bug report here and there or point out where system D might be technically

857
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,400
superior and he and he certainly has that on his side and this it's very easy to rally

858
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:17,920
round someone who is articulate and able to express how their product is technically better

859
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,840
than someone else's but you don't have to be a douche when you do it that is that is

860
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:26,040
sort of the underscores like if you can if you can manage to if you manage to do all

861
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,400
that without offending a bunch of people that's sort of a win-win Baker drinker I wanted to

862
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:37,240
let you chime in on the sort of the state of the debate yeah so all girls receive some

863
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,120
as intense as it was Linux debate is sort of meant to be this way it sort of I was watching

864
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:47,760
a talk a TED talk with Linus Torvalds boss and he explained how intense debate comes

865
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,480
with a better decision at the end of day and I sort of think that people saying that the

866
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,880
way the debate was not gone so politely if you will is kind of wrong I think it debate

867
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,320
should be this way and it's worked out better it's actually almost been sickingly polite

868
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,520
in some ways like here's be Dale's announcement that they're going with system D he writes

869
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:11,220
thank you Anthony for your analysis of the votes per six dot three dot two I use my casting

870
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:16,000
vote to choose D as the winner therefore the resolution reads we exercise our power to

871
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,560
decide in case of overlapping jurisdiction six dot one dot two bias by assuring that

872
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,520
the default init system for Linux architectures in Jesse should be system D should the project

873
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,920
pass a general resolution before the release of Jesse asserting a position statement about

874
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:34,040
issues of the of the day on init systems that position replaces the outcome of this vote

875
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:38,000
and is adopted by the technical committee on its own decision that's a really interesting

876
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,280
way to speak you know it sounds like it's like a like legislation being I could well

877
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,360
yeah except the differences as things are actually happening that's true dubbing actually

878
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:52,160
has activity no the bigger thing there is I think that it's it's not only sounds official

879
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,680
but it'd be hard not to bust into laughter doing it really I would think yeah I mean

880
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,640
they wanted they want to make it official I suppose they are the way making history

881
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,200
with some of these decisions sure I guess there is that element to it all right guys

882
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:10,360
will any other comments before we round off this discussion I will just like I would just

883
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:17,680
like to say that actually earlier someone mentioned that the coverage like it wouldn't

884
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:23,640
matter because we thought it was important at the time but I think actually covering

885
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:28,960
such issues sometimes is what provokes people to think about the as an issue and actually

886
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:35,080
try to find the better the best resolution and not attempt misleading directions yeah

887
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,880
it does make for interesting back listening to when you go back and listen to the issues

888
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,360
of the day in a way it's sort of a living documentation of what happened in some sense

889
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,700
you know you get some of the nooks and crannies of the issue that you don't get when you look

890
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:50,880
back on it three five years later so it's kind of fun from that standpoint talk about

891
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:57,560
today and it you know open source and Linux so much is about building one piece at a time

892
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:03,000
and and it's at that in itself inherently calls for analysis and discussion about the

893
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,720
piece you're working on because every future piece after it is built on top of it so every

894
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,360
piece matters in a sense and I think this one in particular because of the weight of

895
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:14,440
the overall decision because of the meta discussion going on in the greater community it's been

896
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,900
going on for a couple of years now I think this one in particular reach beyond just the

897
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:25,120
interest of bloggers and podcasters and etc I think it really reached to the general user

898
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:29,020
like poppy made the excellent point it affects it affects so many people now because the

899
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:34,720
Debian project has grown and you know with with other huge projects like Ubuntu based

900
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,960
on it it is really it's an important player now and what's really interesting about it

901
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:45,140
is you could you could easily make it's one of our most important players and it is truly

902
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:50,360
community driven and we have just watched this process unfold I mean who knows what

903
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:55,420
kind of discussion there was internally at Red Hat before they set off on system D we

904
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,780
probably could glean some of it from mailing list but I bet you don't get the full scope

905
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:04,360
like you do here with Debian and it's just kind of interesting to watch it a truly community

906
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,960
based project go through this process and yeah I don't know if it's necessarily a bad

907
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,060
thing it took him as long as it did it just I wish it didn't get as heated and I wish

908
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:16,000
maybe people would give folks a little more slack and consider that you know they are

909
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,900
watching something from the outside I think yeah I think that's true I mean there's we

910
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,980
do need to be sensitive to the fact there may be a lot of underpinnings we're not aware

911
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:27,800
of and I have no problem with the amount of time that it takes but I think unless there

912
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:32,260
was actual like threats made against people or whatever I do think the emotional side

913
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:36,500
of it really is going to be hard to justify but the rest of it I would definitely agree

914
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,220
I think that there's no question there's got to be things we're not aware of that could

915
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,940
definitely get people a little bit riled but you know but we're all adults guys you know

916
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,160
we got to at some point you got to like the person that stepped away that's the right

917
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:51,420
approach that's good yeah it was a good decision you know if you're still kind of a little

918
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:56,200
stuck on all of this well I got good news because it's one of these things it's it's

919
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,160
maybe hard to wrap your brain around until you can play it as a video game well good

920
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,340
news we actually have a video game version of the Ubuntu init system debate I'll have

921
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:08,640
a link to the show notes you're kidding me no it's for real it's like it's it's here

922
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:12,260
we go I'm playing it right now it's an it's an attorney game yeah the Debbie in init case

923
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:16,300
get great emerald's trial and it explains to you what the hell's going on with all of

924
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:24,940
this in video game style there we go there we go yeah yeah what kind of achievement do

925
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:30,500
you get if you get the right one this is so this is so 80s awesome right now early 90s

926
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:35,060
awesome and so look I mean come on how is this not the best way it's like Final Fantasy

927
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:40,100
meets the Debbie in init debate I'm really disappointed that your idea of a game for

928
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:45,460
this is not flappy bird it kind of felt like watching flappy somebody play flappy bird

929
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:49,420
I'll tell you that yeah that's true well anyways I'll have a link to the Debbie in init case

930
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,900
in the in the show notes if you want to get in on some of that craziness and then you

931
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,780
know you get to learn a little something out and have fun this is true maybe next time

932
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:01,660
they'll take poppy's advice and make the flappy bird edition assuming that well and if you

933
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,940
install it on your phone and then you can flip it on eBay for 50 grand or what isn't

934
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:12,060
that crazy I know all right so Ben a 14 year old listener writes in and he says hey there

935
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:15,700
Chris and Matt I'm a 14 year old Linux user who would self proclaim himself as a Linux

936
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:20,380
geek and I'm an avid listener of Linux unplugged well hello Ben says I use arch well how about

937
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:25,420
that inspired by inspired by the arch challenge and roll my own arch Linux Raspberry Pi lamp

938
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:30,100
server as well as being a happy user of a custom rig built by myself oh man I want to

939
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:35,060
adopt you he says and more he says and the more I look around the amount of Linux advocates

940
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:40,160
of my generation is very a very small number and it worries me it worries me and surely

941
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:45,460
could be some concern to people of your generation as kids aren't getting sufficient education

942
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:49,940
about computers other kids my generation in my so-called IT classes don't seem to be educated

943
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:53,820
enough unless they really go and look for it like myself which most people will not

944
00:53:53,820 --> 00:54:00,780
do personally I I think that kids of my generation probably of others are not being stretched

945
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:05,740
and not getting the sufficient grounding they need I could be arrogant here although I reckon

946
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:11,500
I could teach my IT class better than my minimum wage teacher does well it sounds like you

947
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,020
might be able to which brings me on to my next point Linux doesn't seem relevant to

948
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:19,880
a lot of people and it seems somehow minor to them I have largely covered my thoughts

949
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:24,220
on the matter of Linux's popularity which I cover on a blog that I call the Linux situation

950
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:27,020
be great if you would just look over it and share your thoughts thanks for the thanks

951
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:30,340
guys and keep up the good work so Ben says that a lot of people don't find Linux relevant

952
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,820
anymore and the darn kids now we talked about this a little bit the darn kids aren't finding

953
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:38,620
Linux that interesting and I just saw an article I don't have a link to it I just saw an article

954
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:43,620
recently that said Linux should be part of IT curriculum and that doesn't yeah doesn't

955
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:47,420
that kind of make sense to for an IT curriculum that makes complete sense if you want to teach

956
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:51,500
computers teach them what teach them like to load a Linux distribution you can learn

957
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:56,220
so much about disk partitioning and so like if you're really taking a computer class it

958
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,540
almost doesn't make a disservice to use Windows because it's like teaching somebody how to

959
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:03,340
work on a car and you give them a car with the hood sealed that's right that's right

960
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:07,420
because I know I folks now that are suffering because of that they they specialized in Windows

961
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:11,300
and now we're having to backtrack and learn stuff that they could have had the opportunity

962
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:16,380
to learn a long time ago so it's actually become a hindrance yeah yeah go ahead I'm

963
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:26,300
sorry go ahead I was just gonna say that I think the biggest part of all this is mainly

964
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:31,020
like you know if you teach them one specific technology then a few years later you have

965
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:39,660
this big setback and what should really be the core part about it is teaching okay here's

966
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:45,660
the basic parts of the computer here's how to get a good sense for being able to read

967
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:53,820
error messages or whatever to basically give the foundation for a flexible mind about computing

968
00:55:53,820 --> 00:56:01,820
so that you know as time goes on you're able to adjust to whatever various things may come

969
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:07,540
in just because you have enough of a foundation that you're able to reason your way through

970
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:13,580
anything that gets put in front of you and and of course knowing how to use Google or

971
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:19,260
whatever to do your own research yeah well that sounds good but it's highly debatable

972
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:24,900
what is a good foundation so that would be hard to do a curriculum for yeah that's true

973
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:28,380
so the guy in here says he's part of this generation he has some thoughts on this go

974
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:37,060
ahead the guy hi Chris less yeah so I'm part of this newfangled teenage generation and

975
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:42,660
I just wanted to say that I really agree that there's not enough education about that this

976
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:48,300
sort of thing I go to a school with over a thousand kids and of them I'm one of maybe

977
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:52,820
like five people that's heard of Linux and I'm the only person that actually uses it

978
00:56:52,820 --> 00:57:01,120
that I'm aware of it's just a matter of people don't know go ahead everything that I learned

979
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:08,060
about Linux was just on my own I mean I first talked about it through a con what's it called

980
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:13,140
a conference and most people don't go to that sort of thing yeah yeah urban urban 120 go

981
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:23,140
ahead yes I think that I heard first of Linux one time that I was with some guys that know

982
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:29,780
a lot about computers but I actually started using Linux because I started watching news

983
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:39,780
action show and I figured out that it is awesome I'm 16 years old and in my school we mentioned

984
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:50,140
feelings that it exists but we in school views word views Microsoft everything is based on

985
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:56,420
not free software right and everything is from Microsoft or from other companies yeah

986
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:03,700
when we gave an assignment for school we need to we need to have it in font times new roman

987
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:11,260
which is from Microsoft and dots dots file and everything is based on the proprietary

988
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:17,380
solutions all right bit puffin go ahead yeah I was just thinking that this doesn't only

989
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:22,360
apply to like operating systems but also like software in general like for example in my

990
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:29,020
school with 3d program we learned Maya and Photoshop but it would have been better I

991
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:35,260
think if we learned gimp and blender because that we could use after school yeah you can

992
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:39,780
get on your own I know that's what you do like freelance work so yeah crossroads you're

993
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:44,700
from this generate that the generation we're speaking of what do you think I mean I go

994
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:50,620
to a school probably about 2000 there are very very few kids who know what Linux is

995
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:54,820
and I can say the word Linux or the word open source and I just get kind of this look like

996
00:58:54,820 --> 00:59:01,900
what are you talking about actually our home our homecoming King this year what is a Linux

997
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:09,100
nerd he's one of my best friends but um anyway I would love for there to be some basic computer

998
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:14,500
education because I've had people ask me why the Internet's broken and why I mean it's

999
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:18,940
just there needs to be something and even if it's not Linux there needs to be something

1000
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:24,940
like this is the Internet yeah I mean I do worry about getting down a path of like you

1001
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:29,140
see on Star Trek where the Captain Kirk arrives to the planet and it's being run by one giant

1002
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:32,980
computer and nobody knows how to how it works and they all think it's a god and they all

1003
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:37,940
worship it or something with her done I know you want to make a point go ahead I think

1004
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:43,220
the problem goes further than that I mean I've just completed university and the number

1005
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:49,100
of people that couldn't even install basic software was ridiculous so I don't even think

1006
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:54,140
they're teaching anything at all in IT classes so it's pretty much a joke isn't this isn't

1007
00:59:54,140 --> 01:00:00,620
this why tablets are seeing the success they are because it is really just so much easier

1008
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:04,580
for people to pick them up and install apps I mean I literally I mean I'm looking at people

1009
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:08,980
who've never used a computer in their lives and they're in their 50s 60s and even 70s

1010
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,900
and they're picking these things up and they're they're installing applications like Netflix

1011
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,300
and Kindle and they're using them and it's just blowing my mind I mean there's still

1012
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:22,460
kids my age who I had one girl come up to me and ask me how do I install this app and

1013
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:25,420
she was running she was an iPhone it's not like it's even difficult she didn't even know

1014
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:31,260
how to install an app well there is that daredevil I want to give you a chance to make your point

1015
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:38,300
so I actually think we can have a different view for a while on this matter I think in

1016
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:46,100
the overall picture IT education has been focused on application usage and getting just

1017
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:53,620
whatever the school is sponsored to sort of make advertising propaganda and at that point

1018
01:00:53,620 --> 01:01:01,260
I don't think it's a matter of what the school teaches but actually if we look at the user

1019
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:07,380
base that Linux has has been pretty much a matter of getting people into learning on

1020
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:12,380
their own and they actually become much more informed and at that point I think it benefits

1021
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:19,260
the overall community and helps actually introducing users not just as users but as also contributors

1022
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:24,820
or part of the community and I don't think that's a bad thing I think it could be improved

1023
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:32,700
and I think actually shows like this do their part on putting the word out I hope so and

1024
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:36,020
I think you're right to an extent that if it's important enough and people need to get

1025
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:39,100
a job done they eventually come across it in a lot of cases people don't know about

1026
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:44,100
Linux is simply because they've never needed to solve a problem that it solves all right

1027
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:49,380
well we got we got we're gonna wrap up with the last two here MW for her M woofer M woofer

1028
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:54,100
I like that I make you I apologize for that I never really thought about the name ever

1029
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:58,900
being pronounced out loud it's just my initials and then the first four characters in my last

1030
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:06,820
name so it's okay yeah well I was just gonna say that what I've been seeing more and more

1031
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:17,660
of is developing this blind spot where it's it's not quite fear but more just willful

1032
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:23,200
ignorance of some kind where they just say well it's a computer I probably can't understand

1033
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:27,500
it I'm not going to try to understand it and you know when when they have to do something

1034
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:32,420
on the computer they go in and they flail around but it's like they're developing this

1035
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:37,540
mental block that maybe at a lot of points they aren't even realizing is operating that's

1036
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:41,420
just keeping them from picking up information it's a computer therefore I'll never learn

1037
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:45,340
how to do it so therefore I just won't that kind of thing bacon drinker do you want to

1038
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:50,540
take us out with your last point yeah I think the problem lies in in modern technologies

1039
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:55,820
and I've succeeded some from the new generation but when you know when you go back in 10 20

1040
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:59,300
years when you have when you bought something you had a screw in the back of it and you

1041
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:02,780
could open it quite easily with the Phillips screwdriver and look inside but nowadays you've

1042
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:07,540
got like talk five screws on the MacBooks and glued to get the phones and it's no incentive

1043
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:11,740
to go ahead and open this stuff right in fact there's every incentive not to open it exactly

1044
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:16,140
damage it and void the warranty in the case of good phone and things like that yeah I

1045
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:20,620
don't truly own a device until you avoid its warranty that very good right very true or

1046
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:25,340
until you've taken it apart and put it back together again well let's let's take the rest

1047
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:29,300
of this in the post show discussion because I think that's a good a good point to wrap

1048
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:34,040
up to in a response to Ben's email and Ben I hope some of that's help provide some insights

1049
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:39,040
and you know one thing you can always do is show folks a way for folks to have a need

1050
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:44,380
to be solved a problem to be solved and show them how Linux solves that problem and I think

1051
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:47,820
once you show them make what it can do for them maybe it's maybe they want to finally

1052
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:51,740
get into some sort of application development maybe they want to set up a file server at

1053
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:55,380
home and run Plex honestly it always depends on the person you know that's one of the reasons

1054
01:03:55,380 --> 01:04:00,780
I used to love comp is is I used to show comp is off at work and clients and people just

1055
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:05,140
like oh my god what is that what how do you do that oh this is Linux let me show you and

1056
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:09,520
that was a door opener and nowadays I just had somebody over at my house a total computer

1057
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,700
noob and they were just blown away by Plex blown away by Plex could never see anything

1058
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:17,660
like Plex can't believe something like Plex exists it's incredible like well here's what

1059
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:20,660
you need and you know that could be an example well here let me set up a help you set up

1060
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:25,180
a Linux box install Ubuntu here we'll put Plex media server on it Bob's your uncle Bob's

1061
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:28,100
your uncle all right now well I think that's a good spot to wrap up here for this week's

1062
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:33,700
episode of Linux Unplugged you know I know I mentioned it earlier but you got to come

1063
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:37,780
over on Sunday to jblive.tv everybody and watch this we're gonna be doing Linux action

1064
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:41,400
show 300 don't worry I think we'll probably release it for download if you can't make

1065
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:47,300
it live but you know that's coming up yeah all right well very good Matt also I want
