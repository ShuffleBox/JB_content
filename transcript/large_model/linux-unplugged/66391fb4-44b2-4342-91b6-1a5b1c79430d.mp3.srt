00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 263, for August 21st, 2018.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,720
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's pushing all of the buttons,

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,080
installing the distros, and just happy to be here to talk about free software.

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,080
My name is Chris.

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,080
My name is Wes.

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,080
Hello, Wes.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,080
It's good to be with you, sir.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,080
I hope you're feeling well.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,080
Oh, yeah.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,080
I mean...

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,080
This smoke isn't getting to you?

12
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
It's very smoky.

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,080
I do feel cold-smoked, but I'm persevering, and more tasty.

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,080
Yeah.

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,720
We have some smoke in the Washington area.

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,760
It is thick out there, but that doesn't stop the Linux content coming down the pipe to

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,760
you.

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,960
Coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged program, Docker has found itself in a bit

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,800
of a controversy, and it's probably not the one you're thinking about.

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,820
It's one canonical found themselves in a long, long, long time ago, and it's one that sometimes

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,180
our friends over at Elementary OS get a hard time about, but somehow, when it's Docker,

22
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,180
it's egregious.

23
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,180
We'll tell you about that.

24
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,000
Plus, Flatpak has a big release.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
They're making a big stink.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,160
Some new features and some really exciting stuff is coming down the pipe for Flatpak.

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,160
We'll cover a couple of cool apps.

28
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,840
We'll get an update on some community events like Academy, AugCamp18, and one that's up

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,880
just around the corner, and then, at the end of the show, it seems there's a bit of a dispute

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,800
between Intel and Debian when it comes to distributing those firmware updates that are

31
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,600
fixing all of those problems, like Meltdown.

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,240
You see, in the last couple of months, there's been some changes in licensing verbiage, and

33
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,360
the Debian project is calling Intel out.

34
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,880
We'll tell you what's going on there and why Intel says, guys, guys, guys, there's nothing

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,880
to worry about.

36
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,560
And then, let's get your life in order.

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
Let's document things.

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,760
We'll give you a way to create your own man pages in seconds on your Linux box.

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,840
That's some stuff.

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
I'm excited.

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,180
And also, we have a full stack today.

42
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,180
We have a full stack.

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,440
So first of all, let's start with Brent.

44
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
Brent is here.

45
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
Hey, guys.

46
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
How's it going?

47
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,440
Good, good.

48
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
And the Mumble Room is here.

49
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
Hello, Virtual Lug.

50
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Hello.

51
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
Hello.

52
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,440
We got a Wimpy in there.

53
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
We got Joe in there.

54
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,800
We got Dan and Cassidy from Elementary OS in there today, plus just some favorites in there,

55
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,160
like Mr. Mac is in there as always.

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,140
Thomas from KDE is joining us to talk about Academy here in a little bit.

57
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,520
So we just have a full room.

58
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,400
I can't see everybody in the room, but I can see a lot of names in there, and that's a

59
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
good list.

60
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,080
So let's kick things off with the news, and that is that Docker is upsetting a lot of

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
people.

62
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,380
You see, Wes, they made a little change.

63
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,560
They made a change on how downloads work.

64
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,080
If you're downloading the Mac version or the Windows version of Docker, you now must provide

65
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,440
your email address before you can download Docker, that you have to go through an email

66
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,600
address that is associated with the Docker store.

67
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,760
So you also would have to then, I suppose, make a Docker store account.

68
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,760
Oh, man.

69
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,680
Is this like one of those white papers that no one ever wants to download ever?

70
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
No.

71
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,760
It's like the Docker community edition, like the full Docker software.

72
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,720
The regular Docker install.

73
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,480
To get that free software, you now have to log in with your store account.

74
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,080
That's a big change, or at least it seems like it to the end user.

75
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,400
What's their motivation here?

76
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,940
Well, so when it was brought out to them, they said, okay, all right, well, we appreciate

77
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,060
that this is bothering you, and we understand that this can feel like a nuisance, but we've

78
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,360
made this change to make sure we can improve the Docker for Mac and Windows experience

79
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,700
for users moving forward.

80
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,240
So the things don't need to change, we'll just close this issue, but you can feel free

81
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,640
to continue to comment, you know, because they're going to improve your experience.

82
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,760
You know, it's funny, it's like this was an issue, but then when that line started to

83
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,120
help improve your experience, then it just blew up, because it turns out anybody who's

84
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,500
clever enough to use Docker is clever enough to read through a marketing line when they

85
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,500
see one.

86
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Yeah, I think so.

87
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,480
And so the controversy really is around two things.

88
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,440
Number one, that they're using this bullshit to improve your experience line, and number

89
00:03:52,440 --> 00:04:00,000
two is that it is putting essentially free software behind a Docker store account, like

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
a Docker hub account.

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,200
And you have to log into that hub account to download the software.

92
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,640
Now presumably you could still compile it for yourself.

93
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,720
That's just not something users on those platforms are very much accustomed to doing.

94
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,040
Right, and it's not like they're going to go app get it on Windows.

95
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,480
Do we have any sympathy, either you Chris or anyone in the Mumble Room for the desire,

96
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,200
you know, we've been talking about elementary efforts, we've talked about Ubuntu wanting

97
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,440
more information from user installs.

98
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,800
Is there any legitimate purpose to the side of, you know, we just want more information

99
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,600
and does this process actually give them that?

100
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,620
Yeah, like what information?

101
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,900
So I, you know, I joked in the intro that both canonical and elementary OS have kind

102
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,760
of gotten heat for something similar.

103
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,680
And that is, you know, a download button where there's a dollar amount that you can enter.

104
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
That got people all kinds of upset too.

105
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,800
Now there's you don't have to sign up, you could just hit zero and download.

106
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,920
So I guess let's start there.

107
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,880
I'm kind of curious to know what the elementary OS guys.

108
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,920
So Dan, what do you think about this, this move?

109
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:59,000
And do you see a big difference between putting it behind a suggested pay what you want and

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,920
putting it behind an account where you have to have like an account on their service?

111
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,080
I think requiring an account makes it a lot harder that I think we should encourage the

112
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,440
monetization of software, especially if it's things we care about because we want them

113
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
to be around.

114
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,440
We want them to be long lasting.

115
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, we don't want, especially for really visible projects like Docker, you don't want

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,440
them to be controlled by special interests.

117
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,440
So Cassidy, I'm curious to know what you think about the messaging aspect of this.

118
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,720
It seems like whenever you make a move like this, you put free software behind a level

119
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,240
of nuisance, as they put it.

120
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,240
You really have to manage the messaging.

121
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,920
You know, you really have to be careful in how you handle that.

122
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
What are your thoughts on that?

123
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,380
Yeah, I think it's always really hard, especially when you're coming from a place where you're

124
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,380
making a change.

125
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,640
You know, you had this thing before and you could get it one way before and now you've

126
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,720
made a change and now you have to provide more information or something to get it.

127
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,800
That's a really tough move.

128
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,920
You know, when we basically rephrased our download to be paying for elementary OS, we

129
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,320
were really careful to always say you're paying for elementary OS.

130
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:06,280
You're not being heavily encouraged to optionally download or optionally donate or something.

131
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,440
We just said you're paying for it.

132
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,400
But you know, people didn't like that either too.

133
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,120
So it's always really tough.

134
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,160
Well, let's just keep moving right along and let's talk about Flatpak 1.0.

135
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,080
It's a big release from the team this week and Flatpak 1.0 comes with a collection of

136
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,940
new features that application developers can take advantage of.

137
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,700
The number one thing that will probably make a big change in your life is developers can

138
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,700
now mark their apps as end of life, which would indicate they're no longer supported.

139
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,640
There is a new mechanism for apps to restart themselves, which is useful if they have to

140
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,860
get access to something.

141
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,080
So a prompt comes up says, can I have access to this and you say yes.

142
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,720
And furthermore, Flatpak has seen a lot of stability improvements.

143
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,880
Some of the biggest changes though are the ecosystem, Flatpak hub has seen some nice

144
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
updates.

145
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,640
There's more and more apps on there now.

146
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,880
And they're pretty proud of this release.

147
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,760
There's several different posts about it.

148
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,540
And one feature that jumped out at me that I would like to poke wimpy about is this new

149
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:03,840
portal system that allows apps to create sandboxes and then restart themselves.

150
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,480
It allows applications to restart after they've been updated to start using a newer version

151
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,040
or to increase sandboxing for parts of the application.

152
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,280
Is this wimpy?

153
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
Is this this?

154
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,900
I've been hearing about this XGD portal, I think it's called, which is like a system

155
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,120
where applications could request access to say the camera.

156
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,120
And then the user at the time that goes to get a prompt at the time that tried to access

157
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,280
the camera and the user would accept or deny sort of like you see in your web browser.

158
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
Have you heard of this?

159
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,520
Yeah, yeah, I'm familiar with this.

160
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:39,160
And we did some work with upstream flat pack a few months ago.

161
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,040
So that portal integration exists in snaps as well.

162
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Ah, that was my next question.

163
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Yeah.

164
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,640
So we're all we're all we're all playing nicely in the same sample there.

165
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,880
Yeah, I like to hear that.

166
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,680
That's really great.

167
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,320
I want to know more about flat packs, peer to peer installs option.

168
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,880
That's not something I'm very familiar with either.

169
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,480
That seems like it could be interesting.

170
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,960
Another note here, they've gone the opposite way of Dropbox.

171
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,240
They no longer require a file system that has extended attributes.

172
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Nice.

173
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,400
Now most of the things when we talk about flat back, they tend to be pretty technical

174
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
topic.

175
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,680
The flat pack team seems to really like to talk about the technical details.

176
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,360
I mean, and those are important to get right.

177
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
Yeah, but you're right.

178
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,200
That has been a lot of the messaging, maybe less so than some of their competitors.

179
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,320
Yeah, like when when you hear about snaps, you hear about snap packages, you hear about

180
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
new applications.

181
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
Exactly.

182
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,320
You don't often hear a lot about the technology.

183
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,320
I mean, it's there.

184
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
If you go digging for it.

185
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
It's all out there.

186
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,480
If you're working with a certain Mr. Martin Wimpress, then it comes out.

187
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,320
So I thought that was interesting, just a different kind of communication mode.

188
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,480
But here's a little bit of the non technical stuff wrote by Alexander Larson.

189
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,360
He writes, most of my blog posts are about technical details.

190
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,800
But the reason for the existence of flat pack is not technical.

191
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,240
I created flat pack because the Linux application desktop ecosystem is fundamentally broken.

192
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,080
As an app developer, you have no sane way to distribute the results of your work to

193
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
users.

194
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,800
Unless you have massive resources, the only realistic way is to wait for distributions

195
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,920
to pick up your app.

196
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,160
But we know that's riddled with issues.

197
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
There's many problems there.

198
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,640
Not all distros will pick up an app, first of all.

199
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,440
And when they do, it's often a chicken and the egg problem where there's maybe like a

200
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,440
web API that has to get updated, but you have to have a different version of PHP on the

201
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
back end.

202
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,860
And so like there's this there's like this multi tier dependency situation that can sometimes

203
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,480
block app updates, right?

204
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,160
Some applications just are not well structured in a way not in bad in general, but just in

205
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,840
a way that with traditional Linux applications are structured.

206
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:36,480
And you also have this this inevitable disconnect and middleman between the application developer

207
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,480
and end user.

208
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,920
So if you have a bug in Mumble, let's say, you probably should be first checking the

209
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,760
Ubuntu bug tracker or the Fedora bug tracker for Mumble and see what the packager has in

210
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,280
there and see if it's a Fedora.

211
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,520
And then you get a reply back saying, no, this is an upstream bug.

212
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,640
And then as an end user, you know, you go upstream.

213
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,200
And I think this is a huge reason why we have all of these freeloaders of free software,

214
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,440
because it's just it's tedious.

215
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,580
It's tedious and it's almost it's almost just too disconnected.

216
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,320
And so with Flatpak, the goal is for the upstream developer to have control of updates.

217
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,880
If the developer fixes an important bug, a new stable version is released so that users

218
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,320
can immediately use it.

219
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,300
Any bugs filed will be against the latest stable version.

220
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:24,860
So the other thing that really does mean, I guess if you break it down, is that it means

221
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,100
when you report bugs as a user, it's useful to you.

222
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,920
There's a direct connection and you get immediate feedback and you get you get an immediate

223
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,320
state a new state of the app.

224
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,920
And I think that's really a good thing for a lot of type of applications.

225
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:45,400
But we are witnessing a fundamental paradigm shift in how software is deployed on Linux.

226
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,200
And we've seen other fundamental paradigm shifts before and we've survived just fine.

227
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,000
So it's nothing to get concerned about.

228
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,720
But the repo model truly is a sysadmin model and Flatpaks and snaps and Docker images and

229
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,840
app images.

230
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,360
Any way that you can easily distribute software and get it going is really the developer model

231
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,040
to distribute software.

232
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,520
And in the past, the sysadmins acted as a gatekeeper.

233
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,480
The repo was like a like an approved application.

234
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,840
Now in practice, was it really that?

235
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,840
Probably not.

236
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
Right.

237
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,840
I mean, really.

238
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
Come on, let's be honest.

239
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
People are probably just rushing to get the work in there sometimes.

240
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,000
They're not like doing extensive tests.

241
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,760
That's not true for all distros, but it's probably the case for some.

242
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,120
But it does represent a fundamental shift here.

243
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,580
You know, you had to be root.

244
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,500
You had to have access to the package management system.

245
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:40,680
The operating system was tracking all of those packages and you were in control of when you

246
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,800
updated them or didn't update them.

247
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:50,000
Now, with a lot of these things, Chrome started it really early on on Windows and Mac.

248
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,440
But it's you've just seen it take off.

249
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,640
You've seen it take off.

250
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,520
I'm struggling to think of a couple of examples on Linux desktop that currently auto update

251
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,000
that aren't snaps.

252
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,320
I can't think of any.

253
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,240
It just really hasn't taken off on the Linux desktop side, auto update of applications.

254
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,760
Maybe some electron apps, but those are bringing some methods from their other environments.

255
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,760
No, no.

256
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,960
So on with electron, the only auto update mechanism that exists is for Windows and Mac

257
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
OS.

258
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,520
And unless you're publishing, you know, via one of the container formats that supports

259
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,520
updates.

260
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,320
OK, so this is a big shift.

261
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,480
And how do we feel about that?

262
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,360
I think I'm good with it, you know, because you got to keep in mind these things are containered.

263
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,640
They have restricted access.

264
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,900
They're not they're not updating all of the libraries on your system.

265
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,880
They're not necessarily dependent on what version of GTK or Qt you have installed.

266
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:48,660
So the all of the reasons why you needed a master orchestrator to orchestrate your packages

267
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,640
are beginning to get chipped away.

268
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:56,480
What the only real argument I can still have here with it and concern would be, well, you're

269
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,320
you're fundamentally taking away my control.

270
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,440
Obviously, I could disable those update features, but defaults reign supreme.

271
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,120
What do you think about that lack of control fundamentally think about your computer?

272
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,320
How would you feel if we got to a point a couple of years where the majority of your

273
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,560
desktop applications were just self-updating all the time?

274
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
How would you feel about that?

275
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,160
I mean, I think in many ways we are there just in that so much of what we use is really

276
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,700
just a slim front end for back end servers.

277
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,480
And we don't control the rollouts of those APIs or that software.

278
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Hardly at all.

279
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
Yeah, you are right.

280
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,560
I think you are trading some control or at least easy understandability.

281
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,840
Now, most cases that you still have all of that, at least for open source things packaged

282
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,960
with these formats, but you're right.

283
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,360
It was a time with a system in where you could carefully craft, you could see all your dependencies,

284
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,920
you knew that, oh, yes, you've got all this dynamic linking.

285
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,640
And here's my one little app that I run, I trust all my system libraries that are maintained

286
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,920
in a sane way.

287
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,400
And it all kind of just fit together, at least if you had the software you needed.

288
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,240
The developer mindset of today are really just the the idea of I'm getting this package,

289
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,920
I know I'm getting it from this developer, I don't need the middleman, I just want it

290
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
to work.

291
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,960
So as long as you trust the upstream that you're getting those updates on, it might

292
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
be a good thing, right?

293
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,680
And there might be a little then more to have, you didn't have to wait as the developer for

294
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,600
your distribution to pick like, oh, yeah, this, we're pushing out a new release.

295
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,800
And this looks like a good version of this over here, we'll pull in that version, you

296
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,320
get to decide, hey, it's time, I feel good about this, it's stable, have at it.

297
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
I do like that.

298
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,600
That's why, you know, sometimes you'll have like stable versions of a snap, and you'll

299
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,660
have an edge version.

300
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:32,160
But Brent, I'm curious to know what you think, you know, using your computer as a professional

301
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,640
photo workstation, you would, I would imagine be a little alarmed if you opened up dark

302
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,480
table or something one day, and it was a totally different UI.

303
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,920
For anybody who's doing production, I think that it's critical to know that your system

304
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,520
isn't changing under you.

305
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,800
And so if you're, you know, on a deadline or something like that, then I don't know

306
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,320
if this auto update is exactly what you will want to have happen without some kind of schedule,

307
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
right?

308
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,920
And so I know one thing I hear so often on the Windows side of things is that that Windows

309
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,240
update just kills everybody during, you know, presentations, we've all seen it, right?

310
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,920
Just trying to get stuff done, and all of a sudden your computer changes under you.

311
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,600
I think a core part of the difference there is that it is the containerization and sandboxing,

312
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
right?

313
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,980
Like, Chris, you've certainly experienced, you did a bad arch update way too close to

314
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,800
a show, or maybe I did in reality.

315
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,400
And your system is not quite hosed, but unless you've done a lot of other work to do a rollback,

316
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,400
you just don't have that option.

317
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,660
And maybe you've tainted a lot of things on your system with a flat back, not so.

318
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,540
In the context of snaps, there's a couple of things to bear in mind there.

319
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:40,040
First of all, if an update happens beneath a running application, then that doesn't kill

320
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,300
or destroy the application that you're using.

321
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:50,200
The update happens in a new revision, and the next time you restart, you know, close,

322
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:55,840
rerun the application, then the update that happened in the background is applied effectively.

323
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:02,600
And also as an application publisher, you can take advantage of a facility called Trax.

324
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,600
So if you have, you know, major versions that introduce new and potentially breaking features,

325
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:15,560
then you can publish Trax by version or whatever, so that, you know, as a conservative user,

326
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,980
if you've opted into the 1.0 release, you can stay with that for as long as you want.

327
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:26,400
And then you make the decision to jump from the 1.0 release to the 2.0 release, for example.

328
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,840
Whereas if you want just security fixes, like everyone does, I want those automatically.

329
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:38,080
Features and, you know, improvements and maybe even bug fixes, not so sure about, but if

330
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,120
it's security patches, I want those while I'm not even at my computer.

331
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
Right.

332
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,160
And so, you know, the publisher will be producing their 1.0 dot, you know, whatever minor version,

333
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,880
and they would push their bug fixes and security fixes in there.

334
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,000
And then you can choose when you want to hop on to the, you know, the new release train

335
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
via a track.

336
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,160
And there are lots of publishers that are using that mechanism.

337
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:09,040
It will soon be possible with snaps to also install different versions of the same snap

338
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:15,000
in parallel side by side so you can have the old version and the future version installed

339
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
side by side.

340
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah.

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
All right.

342
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,280
So, Dan, the last word on this.

343
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
So, Dan, what are your thoughts?

344
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
Yeah.

345
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,420
I mean, I think something we also got to consider is that we're coming from a world where we're

346
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,400
used to applications only really being able to be updated every six months or every year

347
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,160
or whatever your distro release cycle is.

348
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:39,160
And app developers that are targeting the Linux desktop have really long release cycles.

349
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,240
Mainstream apps that are already used to faster release cycle models or software as a service

350
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,160
and things like that, they're used to doing more incremental changes.

351
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,560
But I think we're going to see more developers doing incremental changes.

352
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't think you're going to see like big, massive reworks of entire things that break

353
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
your workflow.

354
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,840
It's going to be little tweaks and refinements and you won't really notice changes like really

355
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,840
rapidly.

356
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
That makes sense.

357
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:06,360
And it would probably be much well received by end users, you know, small incremental

358
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,600
changes, just steady improvements.

359
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,720
It's also easier to get some feedback and make quick course corrections that way as

360
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
well.

361
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
Yeah.

362
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
All right.

363
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
I know we have more to talk about.

364
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,480
I don't know if we have time, but I just wanted to give you a couple of pics just from Flatpak

365
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,440
while we're talking about Flatpak and Flatpak Hub.

366
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,840
And the first one is PulseFX.

367
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,560
PulseFX is an audio manipulation tool.

368
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,400
And it's really great because if you just want to pop on a compressor or do a high pass

369
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,320
or a low pass on some audio or I do run it through an EQ, like maybe got a podcast that's

370
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,120
a little hard to understand or something like that, PulseFX will do that for you.

371
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,360
And then on the snap side, I noticed a new snap package came out this week that looks

372
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
really neat.

373
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,120
I always like having like an alternative web browser.

374
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,160
Like I've got my main browser, which is Firefox and I've got Chrome and I even have Opera

375
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,680
installed and Opera would be like the one that I do like that one off log into or, you

376
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,120
know, you know, when it's like no minimum extension.

377
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
So it's always really fast.

378
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,680
You got a lot of you maybe have got a big session going.

379
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,960
You want just another mindset.

380
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Yeah.

381
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,880
I noticed there is a tabless browser that just showed up in the Snap Store.

382
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,160
I'm looking for the name for right now.

383
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,520
I don't know if you happen to know it off the top of your head, Wimpy, by any chance.

384
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
It's Calibri.

385
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
Calibri.

386
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,520
Yeah.

387
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,320
That's what I mean when you search for Calibri.

388
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,040
So if you want to Google it, search for like Calibri browser or just do a snap find.

389
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,320
And that looked pretty neat, too.

390
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,440
So that that joins Opera recently is several browser options in the Snap Store.

391
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
It's pretty neat.

392
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,040
It makes it real easy when you want to bootstrap a new system.

393
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
That's for sure.

394
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Yeah.

395
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
All right.

396
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
So there is some some community news.

397
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,040
We're going to do a tight episode today because I got to get out of here for a doctor's appointment

398
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,520
just in about a half hour.

399
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,340
So it's going to be like a tight show.

400
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:46,560
So I want to get to Academy this week because that just wrapped up.

401
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,680
And Thomas has joined us.

402
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:52,260
He is a board member over at KDE and he went to Academy.

403
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:56,440
And so we thought we'd use this opportunity to pick his brain about what Academy is and

404
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,920
what kind of happened there and why KDE has an event like this and all that stuff.

405
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,440
So, Thomas, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

406
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
Thank you.

407
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,440
Hi.

408
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
Hi.

409
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,680
So why don't we start with a little bit about yourself and then we'll get to Academy.

410
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
Okay.

411
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
Yeah.

412
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:18,760
So, yeah, I've been in the KDE community since about 10 years or so.

413
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:25,400
And I've actually joined in the user experience usability team since now two years.

414
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:33,480
I've been on the board of directors of KDEV, which is the official organization of KDE.

415
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:41,440
And we do things like, for example, organize the Academy, which is the yearly KDE community

416
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,040
and contributors conference.

417
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Very good.

418
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,400
So if I recall correctly, it's a two-day event within like a couple of days or a few days

419
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,100
of workshops and whatnot and birds of the feather sessions and things like that.

420
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,040
So what's the goal of Academy?

421
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,160
Is this really like a time to bring people under the KDE umbrella together in one spot?

422
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,160
Yeah, exactly.

423
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
That's about it.

424
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,840
So it's, yeah, as you said, the two days of regular conference with talks where people

425
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,560
just update the community on what they've been up to.

426
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:19,160
It can be application developers, plasma developers, designers.

427
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:25,280
It's really just, yeah, seeing what others have been doing.

428
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,640
And then this is followed, as you said, by the what you call both days, which is workshops

429
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,920
and just communities discussing what they've what they plan for the next for the upcoming

430
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:44,480
year and or just some people gathering around a specific topic and just trying to come up

431
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,480
with new ideas.

432
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
Yeah, absolutely.

433
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,440
So give me an idea of what got done this year at Academy.

434
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,920
One very interesting thing this year was that we had several hardware vendors at Academy

435
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:03,000
who are going to use our technology in the near future.

436
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:14,000
So we had Pine64, who are making an ARM based cheap laptop, who are now going to use plasma

437
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,080
as a desktop available on there.

438
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:28,160
We had Mycroft, who, as you probably all know, making desktop AI and virtual digital assistant.

439
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:37,200
And they've become interested in us when one of us created an integration of Mycroft into

440
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Plasma Desktop and are now looking into more tighter cooperation with us.

441
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:54,160
And yeah, we also had Slimbook, who have now been doing the second KDE focused laptop.

442
00:22:54,160 --> 00:23:01,920
And we also had Purism, who will offer Plasma as one of the operating systems for the new

443
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,000
phone.

444
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,800
And yeah, having all of them at Academy was really interesting because they also talked

445
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:18,280
among each other and thought about how they could collaborate and also learned about what

446
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,600
kind of ways they could use our technology in their hardware.

447
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,520
So that is something which is fairly new for us and it's really exciting to be working

448
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,400
together with the industry, with hardware vendors.

449
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
No kidding.

450
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Yeah, I bet.

451
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,720
That sounds like it was immensely valuable to have everybody there and have specifically

452
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,820
those hardware folks there.

453
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:41,340
That is really exciting to see that interest in KDE and I assume the Plasma Desktop too.

454
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:46,140
So one of the number one questions that always comes into the show whenever we mention, oh,

455
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,880
Academy happened, is do you release any of the talks or any of the sessions or any videos

456
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
of the event?

457
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,880
Yeah, we do.

458
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,960
So it's all on the Academy website.

459
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,440
If you go, I think they're not available yet, but they will be available sometime in the

460
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,440
coming weeks.

461
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,400
You just go to the academy.kde.org website, then go to the program and then you have all

462
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:16,760
the sessions and then there's the video and the slides if the presenter has uploaded them.

463
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,640
But definitely the video is available for all the talks.

464
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Great.

465
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,640
And it moves around, right?

466
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,880
So I imagine it'll be somewhere different next year?

467
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,920
Yeah, definitely.

468
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,240
We haven't decided on a location yet.

469
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,840
So if somebody has an idea and has a team of people who would like to host an Academy,

470
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,840
then yeah, we're still open for suggestions.

471
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,880
And yeah, so far it's been always within Europe, but we are also open to any locations outside

472
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
of Europe.

473
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,360
So it will be interesting to see where Academy will happen next year.

474
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,960
All right, Canada, you heard it here first, Canada, you could totally host Academy next

475
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,960
year.

476
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,960
I'm just saying.

477
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
Brent, you could get that going, right?

478
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
We're going to work on it.

479
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,960
I'll see what I can do.

480
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
I'll talk to my people.

481
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
He's still getting one big room.

482
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
Chat it out.

483
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
That's fine.

484
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,320
I'm totally baggsy-ing this now before Popey hears about it.

485
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,920
Yeah, he went.

486
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,280
I was going to...

487
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,360
I'm hoping to hear his impressions on the Ubuntu podcast soon because...

488
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,400
You will hear all about Popey's impressions of Academy on Thursday when we release the

489
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,000
next episode of the Ubuntu podcast.

490
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,520
Well, I will, as always, be listening because I'll be curious to hear that.

491
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,280
Well, Thomas, thank you for coming on and telling us about it.

492
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,200
Is there anything else you want to relay to the audience?

493
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:30,520
I'll have academy.kde.org linked in the show notes so people can check that out and keep

494
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,640
an eye out for when the videos come.

495
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,040
Is there any other resources they should probably know about?

496
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:42,440
There's also dot.kde.org, which is our main news site and which had a summary of each

497
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:48,320
day and both the conference days and of the both days, so that can also be a quick entrance

498
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,320
point.

499
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
I see.

500
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
And there's some video up there, too.

501
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
Yeah.

502
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,320
All right.

503
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Well, if you're a Plasma and KDE fan, something you should be checking out.

504
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,800
Anyways, well, Thomas, thank you very much for coming on and taking the time to tell

505
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,200
us about it.

506
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,600
Sounds like it was a great event.

507
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,080
I'm really happy to hear that.

508
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,920
Now, while we're talking about community events, I would like to pick Mr. Wimpy's brain and

509
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,320
perhaps Joe, if he wants to share with the class, too, about AugCamp, which is another

510
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,040
event that I have not been to.

511
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:21,120
AugCamp just wrapped up, AugCamp 18 on August 18th and August 19th in 2018, and it sounds

512
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,960
like it's a pretty fun event.

513
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,760
At least according to the guys' voices, which sounds like they had a little too much to

514
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
drink.

515
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,120
So why don't we start with Wimpy?

516
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,080
How was your trip to AugCamp, Wimpy?

517
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,080
Well, as always, brilliant fun.

518
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,520
So started on the Friday.

519
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:44,480
I rolled out the Ubuntu podcast Battle Bus, picked Poppy up from the local station, then

520
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,400
we drove to meet Mark at his house, and then all the way up to Sheffield, and then out

521
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:55,000
for the social event on the Friday evening, the first meetup at AugCamp, which took place

522
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,720
in a pub in the town center, and we pretty much took over the whole top floor of this

523
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,680
pub, which was good.

524
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,600
Nice to see people you don't see very often, like Joe, for example.

525
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,720
I only see Joe maybe two or three times a year.

526
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,320
So good to catch up with Joe.

527
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,320
Yeah.

528
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,920
Now, what actually happens there, though?

529
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,560
I mean, what you just told me was you went out and had a good time.

530
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,960
And that is part of what happens, right, isn't it, Joe?

531
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,280
That's everything that happened for me, I'm afraid.

532
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
Honesty to the last.

533
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
Yeah.

534
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,280
Yeah.

535
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Why is that a bad thing, though, really?

536
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,400
I mean, if you go in there, you have a good time hanging out with Linux folks.

537
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
It's worth it, right?

538
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Yeah.

539
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:37,320
I just made the mistake that I drank too much on the Friday and then ended up not actually

540
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,680
waking up in time to see any of the talks and then making the exact same mistake on

541
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,680
the Saturday.

542
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:49,200
But thankfully, Wimpy and Poppy and Co actually managed to get up, so yeah, fill me in, man.

543
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,360
I was there, but I didn't see any of it.

544
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,040
So what did I miss?

545
00:27:53,040 --> 00:28:02,800
So Ogg Camp is a free culture unconference, and the organizers do arrange like a talk

546
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,400
every hour or so, so that there is something happening on the main stage.

547
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:13,240
So if you just turn up and everyone's feeling shy, there is something to sort of see and

548
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,820
learn from.

549
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:20,280
So there were three stages, the main auditorium and two smaller stages, and then there was

550
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:26,560
also a Coder Dojo, which was run by Ben Nuttall from the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

551
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:33,160
And that was basically a full weekend of teaching kids how to get started with programming and

552
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,320
make interesting Raspberry Pi projects.

553
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:43,800
And I spent most of Sunday morning up there and it was just chock full of games controllers

554
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:50,920
and micro bits and robot parts and projecting equipment and musical instruments and all

555
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:56,360
manner of stuff that they were furiously plugging together and hacking about with and making

556
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,360
projects out of it.

557
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,240
It was pretty fantastic to see.

558
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,240
I bet.

559
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,240
Hmm.

560
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,760
And then in terms of the talks, there's obviously the scheduled talks.

561
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,120
Some of those this year included somebody talking about, you know, configuration management

562
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,120
via the various tools that exist and giving people a primer on that.

563
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:23,320
And one of my favorite talks was by a guy who was running mainframe emulators on a Raspberry

564
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,760
Pi, which was just brilliant fun, yeah, really good fun.

565
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:33,580
So if you think that, you know, it's sort of those are the two extremes of, you know,

566
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,280
what you can expect to find, you know, and everything in between, you know, a little

567
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:44,040
bit about, you know, cooperative organizations and the, you know, the free culture and open

568
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,800
source communities.

569
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,260
And one, I think one or two live podcasts this year.

570
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:55,160
So we did a big mashup with Joe.

571
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,600
So that will be coming out on Joe's channel, he'll have details about that.

572
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:03,960
And a couple of, most of the podcasts in the UK sort of meet there and some of them do

573
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,440
their live shows from our camp as well.

574
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,520
I'm only just a little bit jealous, Chris.

575
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
I know.

576
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
I know.

577
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
Me too.

578
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,120
I was like, ah, ah, I want to go one of these days.

579
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
One of these days.

580
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
I'll just come hang out.

581
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
One of these years anyway.

582
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
Yeah.

583
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
I want to ride in the battle bus.

584
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
Me too.

585
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
That sounds like a good time.

586
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,960
The battle bus is fully Wi-Fi operational with power sockets for all popular makes and

587
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
models of laptops.

588
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
Very nice.

589
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,800
That is a battle bus.

590
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,520
That is a bus that's designed for an event.

591
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,640
It probably is.

592
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,720
Now I guess I should also give a mention to Foscon.

593
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,760
I won't be there, but I thought I'd mention it.

594
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,180
It's going to be in Philadelphia and it's coming up very soon.

595
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,880
So go check this out, foscon.us if you want to go.

596
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,720
And they are doing it, I think, August 25th, yep, August 25th.

597
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,480
So if you are in the Philadelphia area and would like to go to a free open source software

598
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,440
focused event, Foscon 2018 in the International House of Philadelphia.

599
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
Huh.

600
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,080
How about that, Wes?

601
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,080
Looks like it should be a good time.

602
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,160
I don't suppose you're just going to randomly be in Philadelphia in a couple days.

603
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,160
Alas, no.

604
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
No.

605
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
No.

606
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,160
No, probably not.

607
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
No, no.

608
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
No, neither will I.

609
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,160
But it does look like a good time.

610
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,240
For everyone who's lucky enough to be around that area.

611
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
So what's the verdict?

612
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,240
Is there going to be an odd camp?

613
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,240
Is this an odd camp?

614
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
Is it going strong?

615
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240
Is there an odd camp next year?

616
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,400
Is that being discussed yet?

617
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
Does anybody know?

618
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,840
There are already discussions about how to put on an odd camp again next year.

619
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:33,000
And the wonderful John Spriggs, also known as John the Nice Guy Spriggs, is starting

620
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
to bootstrap things.

621
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Oh.

622
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,600
There is already a Trello board, and there has been some activity this morning.

623
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,760
Very good.

624
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,720
So let's take a moment and thank the sponsors of this year's show.

625
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,360
And like I said, we're doing a tight one this week.

626
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,880
And I want to get to this Intel stuff, and I want to get to making your own man pages

627
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,040
with this cool command, because it's just the best.

628
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,600
So let's start by thanking Ting.

629
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,760
Go to linux.ting.com to get $25 off a device.

630
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,660
Or if you bring your own device, you get $25 in service credit.

631
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:03,480
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month, because it's smarter than unlimited.

632
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,800
If you use less, you pay less.

633
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,520
You pay for what you use wireless.

634
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,360
Nationwide coverage with no contracts.

635
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,000
However much you talk, text, or data you use, that's what you pay.

636
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,880
That's why I've been a Ting customer for over four years, and they've got a great control

637
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,880
panel.

638
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,880
Radically good customer.

639
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,880
Different than everybody.

640
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
Just better than everybody.

641
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,880
Customer service.

642
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,880
I mean, it's seriously better than everybody.

643
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,440
They have a bunch of really great devices, and Ting does a really good job of sorting

644
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,600
through devices that should get a lot more attention, but they just, from the general

645
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,320
tech press, from your Verge outlets, they just don't get that attention.

646
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,520
And there's so many good phones out there.

647
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,920
You don't have to spend $1,000 on a smartphone.

648
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,320
And whatever you are comfortable spending, you go to Ting's site, and you own that phone

649
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,320
outright.

650
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,320
It's yours.

651
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,320
There's no contract.

652
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,320
There's no other termination fee.

653
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,320
It's yours.

654
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,320
Look at that.

655
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,320
They have a 10-inch tab on here.

656
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,680
Oh, I haven't seen them sell on a tablet for a long time.

657
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
No.

658
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,680
$170 when you go to linux.ting.com.

659
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,680
That is not bad.

660
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,680
Yeah, with a 10-inch display?

661
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
Yeah.

662
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
That isn't bad.

663
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,680
Hmm.

664
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
Anyways, it's a great service.

665
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,200
I've been a customer for a long time.

666
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
I think you'll love it.

667
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,200
So go to linux.ting.com.

668
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,160
Something else I've been a customer for forever.

669
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
DigitalOsh.

670
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,160
DigitalOcean.

671
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,480
D-O dot C-O slash unplugged.

672
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:18,600
Give you a $100 credit when you sign up with a new account for 60 days, and you can try

673
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,600
out their infrastructure for 60 days.

674
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,600
With that $100 credit, you can do just about anything.

675
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
Wait, are you sure that's right?

676
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
$100 credit?

677
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
I know.

678
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
I'm waiting for them to figure out that they accidentally are still giving us that promo.

679
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
So hurry.

680
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm like, guys, go out there and use this, because they can't keep doing that, can they?

681
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,120
I mean, I don't know, man.

682
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,200
It's a great deal, though, because you can do so much stuff.

683
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,440
And every system has SSDs, and they've got 40-gigabit connections coming into the hypervisors,

684
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,780
a great dashboard.

685
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,780
It's only getting better.

686
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,960
There are a bunch of new dashboard changes that are just blowing my mind.

687
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,960
Yeah, really good.

688
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,520
Like, how often does that happen, where they do like a big shift like that, and it's not

689
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520
a total controversy?

690
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,520
I logged in.

691
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,120
They had made some changes, and it didn't stop me at all.

692
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,680
In fact, if anything, it was more intuitive.

693
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,720
Yeah, they really do get the design of that kind of stuff.

694
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,000
It's a great platform to get you up and going with Linux box in seconds, really.

695
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,640
Probably less than 55 seconds.

696
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,380
And you can play with something you've been wanting to try for a long time up on their

697
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,360
crazy fast infrastructure, and then pop it into production.

698
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:19,440
So go to do.co slash unplugged, and thank you to Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash

699
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
unplugged.

700
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,760
It's a platform to learn everything about Linux, the stuff that's going to look good

701
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,000
on your resume, the stuff that's going to give you critical thinking skills, and the

702
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,380
stuff you should just know, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

703
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:34,160
Every member has access to so much content, and they're always adding new content.

704
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:39,560
They've been expanding out their Google Cloud Platform, Azure, security, and of course,

705
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,640
the essentials of Linux itself.

706
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:45,700
It's interesting to really see how the market is growing so, so fast, and how Linux Academy

707
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:51,520
is impressively managing to keep up, despite the fact that their content is so rich and

708
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,240
deep that it can take, I don't know if they've ever released the number publicly, but making

709
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,560
content is always much harder than you think, and they can spend more than several months

710
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,320
working on one set of courseware.

711
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,440
Yeah, something that takes you just a few minutes to click through, or an hour or two

712
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,440
to finish.

713
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,760
And they will spend, because it's like developing a full product, with labs, and interactive

714
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:20,900
diagrams, and videos, and voiceovers, and text guides, and study cards, and downloadable

715
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,360
stuff that you can listen to, like audio, or personal study books, like if it's really

716
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
comprehensive.

717
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,200
And then if you ever get stuck, they've got a real human being that can help you, that

718
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,080
are topic experts, that are folks from the industry that Linux Academy has hired to not

719
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,980
only create the courseware, but to answer your questions with it too.

720
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,200
So a lot of times, when you get stuck, you are asking the person that created that courseware,

721
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:46,540
so not only are they a topic expert on that subject, but they're the ones that created

722
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,600
that course.

723
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,560
So it's really helpful.

724
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,600
It's so, so valuable, and that's just part of why Linux Academy is such a great value,

725
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,440
and you can try it seven days for free, when you go to linuxacademy.com, slash, unplugged.

726
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,160
That's linuxacademy.com, slash, unplugged.

727
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,880
You like my mic grab there?

728
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,880
Oh man, that was just, you're a professional broadcaster.

729
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,720
I appreciate a good mic grab, I bet.

730
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Grab me by the mic, I always say.

731
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,720
Wes, I've always said that, haven't I?

732
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,720
I've always said that.

733
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:14,220
Let's talk about this Intel firmware thing.

734
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:20,240
So Debian has labeled Intel firmware as now unredistributable by all OS vendors.

735
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,600
They're speaking for everyone there.

736
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,260
And this is something that catches my attention, because Debian is very careful about licensing,

737
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,200
and they really go through this kind of stuff.

738
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,360
And so here's essentially a breakdown of what happened.

739
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:39,280
Intel pushed out a new firmware update recently, and they reached out to some of the projects,

740
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,900
like Debian, and said, hey, new firmware needs to go out.

741
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,960
Can you package this up and send it?

742
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,360
To which Debian promptly responded, no, we can't, because you changed your license in

743
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,760
an incompatible way a month ago, and now we can no longer redistribute firmware updates.

744
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,720
And they link them to the text file that says, sorry, we can't do that.

745
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:05,440
And some folks have tweeted rather strong feelings about the situation that Intel is

746
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,000
putting users in.

747
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Here's one.

748
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,720
Intel really effed up on the foreshadow and SSBD microcode updates.

749
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:16,800
Beyond any of my wildest thoughts, they added a long license to the microcode that doesn't

750
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,520
allow redistribution, which is why Linux distributions won't be getting patched.

751
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,960
Well, we know that's not true.

752
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,960
They are already getting patched.

753
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,360
Right, and there are other distributions that are distributing these already.

754
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,920
So yeah, not universal.

755
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,680
So it was like, we tried to figure out what's going on here, and I dug around, and I found

756
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,620
a tweet by the corporate vice president and GM of Intel's Open Source Technology Center.

757
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,720
That seems like a good source to go to, right?

758
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,080
So dug in there, and here's his reply.

759
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,440
He says, this is just simply not true.

760
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,480
You see, this is now legalese.

761
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,380
The license section two, subsection three, grants rights needed for redistribution, specifically,

762
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:58,460
and he's quoting, distribute an object code representation of the software provided by

763
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,080
Intel through multiple levers of distribution.

764
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,860
We're happy to work with them if there's still concerns.

765
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:12,640
So now we have a Debian says and Intel says situation, and it sort of created this impasse.

766
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,200
And it's so funny how we get hung up on this kind of stuff.

767
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,040
And I'm sure eventually get resolved, and it'll probably be resolved in a way that's

768
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,800
beneficial for end users.

769
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,500
But it has caused quite the upset on this particular thing.

770
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,400
Lots of finger pointing at Intel for screwing this whole thing up.

771
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,960
And so the response has been, well, so now what?

772
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,960
So now what do we do?

773
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,680
So Debian looks at it a little further, and they say, well, here's the problem.

774
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,480
Above where you just told us to look, it says that, but before that, that we can't redistribute

775
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,480
it.

776
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,520
So we have ourselves a conflict within your license.

777
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,800
Your license says you cannot distribute, and then further down says you can distribute.

778
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,120
We don't know what to do here.

779
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,980
And as far as I know, the last time I looked into this issue, that's where it has landed.

780
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,920
It's landed on, eh, Debian's not really sure what to do.

781
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,560
And I mean, it does seem like they are working with Intel, and I've seen some other, you

782
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,520
know, asking people to don't just go harassing Intel.

783
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,920
They have their own channels, and things are being worked on.

784
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,920
Yeah, they are.

785
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,920
Yes.

786
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,600
It is kind of confusing, too, because like if you go download some of the tarballs here,

787
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,120
the previous microcode release doesn't have the license file in there.

788
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,600
But when prompted on the website, it pops up a thing that you do have to agree to the

789
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,160
license to get the link.

790
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,980
Now once you have the link, you can just download it.

791
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,780
On the latest one, no such pop up, but a license in the tarball.

792
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,000
So clearly there are some changes, and I can see why, you know, Debian does have a long

793
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,740
history of caring a lot about open source licensing.

794
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:33,220
And while often as end users we might feel it can be pedantic at times, it is actually

795
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,220
pretty important.

796
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,680
So I can understand why they would want to take the cautious side.

797
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
Yeah.

798
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,680
Yeah.

799
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,600
And I should also add that for a lot of these things, you know, you can rebuild the package

800
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,760
yourself pretty easily.

801
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,280
You can install the microcode manually.

802
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,160
If you are a, you know, a big cloud provider, this is not the problem that you're having.

803
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,120
It's more of a problem just for people like you and I.

804
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,120
Fair point.

805
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,120
Yeah.

806
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,120
Yeah.

807
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Yeah.

808
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,120
Just us end users getting screwed.

809
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,120
Yeah.

810
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,120
All right.

811
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,880
Well, I have a sense this is going to get worked out.

812
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,420
I really do.

813
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,480
And if anybody knows anything different, send me a tweet.

814
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
Let me know where this is going.

815
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,720
But I have a sense it's going to get worked out.

816
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,720
All right.

817
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,260
Well, then let's, let's, let's end on a way for people to create their own man pages.

818
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:16,240
Man pages are one of the greatest things that I didn't know about when I switched to Linux

819
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:22,620
initially until like six, seven months in because I was, I was very fortunate that I

820
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,460
started playing with Linux in high school.

821
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:28,860
And so that meant there was other high school kids that I could mess around with and we

822
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,720
all just bounced off each other, you know, look what you can do here.

823
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,720
Try this out.

824
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,720
Oh, this is red hat.

825
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,260
This is this, you know, this is Debbie and this is, you know, we just, that was our mode.

826
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:41,320
We didn't, and there was no Google cause I'm so old.

827
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,760
There was no like web search to go like look up commands.

828
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,900
So like not knowing that man existed was a huge oversight.

829
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:51,600
It's a way it's you, you could get away with never using man today and just searching everything

830
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
you need on Google.

831
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,720
Now, I don't recommend that you do that, but you're totally right.

832
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,920
You absolutely can.

833
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,800
And you probably just find some online man pages.

834
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Yeah.

835
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,280
So this is why this was egregious because there was a early on and some of you might

836
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,640
remember this, there was the Linux documentation project.

837
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,400
I don't know if that rings a bell for some of you out there.

838
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:14,320
And it was a valiant effort by a community on the internet to create a central repository

839
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:19,720
of documentation on how to do things, which was outdated immediately.

840
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,280
And obviously it was only applicable to certain distros, et cetera.

841
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,840
So it never really was that great of a resource.

842
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,600
And it couldn't compare to all of the other communities that are writing specifically

843
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,280
about their distros that Google now helps you surface.

844
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,640
So it took me a little while to find man, but once I found the man page system, I was

845
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,320
so impressed, like, wow, they just have this built in right here at the command line.

846
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,640
Like I can see example commands here.

847
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,160
And that's when I really went, you know, when I realized you could bring up a man page and

848
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,760
generally if you went all the way down to the bottom, there's a few example commands.

849
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,240
Offline just all of this knowledge right at your fingertips.

850
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,680
I feel like it's a bigger deal than we are capable of appreciating right now.

851
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,080
And I don't know if that sounds silly, but I feel like today it's like, oh yeah, no big

852
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
deal.

853
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,160
But if you think about what life was like when you couldn't just easily search for stuff,

854
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,040
that really, really helped.

855
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,000
And that's how life is today for things that are sort of unique to your own setup or your

856
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
own world.

857
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,840
And wouldn't it be nice if you could have your own man pages so you can remember how

858
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,840
to do stuff?

859
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:23,360
Well, that's where this handy command that I love the name of comes in.

860
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:29,720
It's called um, um, um, how do I?

861
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:34,520
And um is a command line utility for creating and maintaining your own set of man like help

862
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,520
pages.

863
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,600
Man being short for manual if you didn't know.

864
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,280
And I love this.

865
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,680
These man pages are written to be comprehensive, but what humans really need are just bullet

866
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,680
points.

867
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,400
So you could use um to just write your own bullet points and they would come out on the

868
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:54,920
command line and they include a couple of basic syntax formatting tips and a couple

869
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,740
of basic commands you can run and it's so neat.

870
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:05,360
It's a only available for Mac OS right now, but I just sent off a letter to the developer

871
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:10,600
today saying, Hey, and you know, I think that is also just because they've only packaged

872
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,040
it in homebrew cause I've got it running right here.

873
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,040
Well, that's awesome.

874
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,320
I was going to say, yeah, Hey, there is some ways to get this installed on Linux that don't

875
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,320
use brew.

876
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,640
I saw, I sent off a note to him today, so maybe we'll see something there, but yeah,

877
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,680
you can build it yourself.

878
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,680
And what do you think?

879
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,680
Well, okay.

880
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,160
So there are already ways to make man pages extensible and there's a lot of design in

881
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,760
man page systems that, you know, just to facilitate that a bit.

882
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,060
That said, I think there is something of a disconnect between people that are experts

883
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,060
and how to do that.

884
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,560
And then especially know, you know, how to typeset and create man pages in the proper

885
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,200
or at least historically correct ways.

886
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,280
I think again, where this tool maybe shines and we'll see how popular it becomes is that

887
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,700
that casual developer, you use man pages somehow, you don't really understand how it all works,

888
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:58,080
but if you can just type a command and you know, you just have to edit a markdown file.

889
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,600
It uses Pandoc and other stuff behind the scenes to convert that, display it with man

890
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,120
like utilities.

891
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,120
It does look nice.

892
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,280
And I just added a couple and it was really easy.

893
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,320
So I think that's the, that's the kicker right there.

894
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,320
Cool.

895
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,120
Now Brent, you've got a whole solution for your own man management right now.

896
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,360
Well, I would say it's my attempt at cobbling something like this together in the last several

897
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,360
years.

898
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:23,140
Um, I, and I'm sure I'm not the only one doing this, but, uh, I've just kind of started to

899
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:28,880
half hazardly keeping text files of notes of solutions and tricks and little shortcuts

900
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:35,080
of various commands and, uh, in basically just text files in a folder that gets synced

901
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,080
to all my machines.

902
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:41,500
And, uh, so it would be interesting to see it in a little bit of a slight ever so slightly

903
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,000
easier to access, um, solution like this.

904
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,280
I kind of like this idea.

905
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,280
Yeah.

906
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,640
Getting to sync would be like the next thing, right?

907
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,240
Sinking it across like maybe even like it wouldn't have to sync continuously just when

908
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,240
you update.

909
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,760
And there are, there are already some efforts for collaborative sorts of documentation.

910
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,440
It would be interesting to see some of those prepackaged and sets you could maybe go grab,

911
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,640
you know, Oh, I'm a, I'm a Ruby developer.

912
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,200
Give me a set that has a bunch of common Ruby tools and away I go.

913
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,000
Oh, I like that.

914
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Hmm.

915
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Hmm.

916
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
All right guys.

917
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,320
Well, like I said, it is a tight one today cause I have an, I have an appointment that

918
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,600
I cannot miss.

919
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,280
And so we're going to get out of here a little early today, but, uh, the, uh, unplugged show

920
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,380
is live on Tuesdays.

921
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:25,000
If you'd like to make it out next week, go to jblive.tv and it's, uh, also available

922
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,160
in your local time at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar.

923
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,440
Go get more West Payne.

924
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,920
He's on the TechSnap program, TechSnap.systems.

925
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:33,920
Go get more Wimpy.

926
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,920
He's on a Ubuntu podcast.

927
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,920
Go get that.

928
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,680
This Thursday sounds like it's going to be a great one.

929
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,360
You can find Dan and Cassidy over at Elementary OS.

930
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,420
We'll have their respective Twitter handles linked in our show notes and a big thank you

931
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:48,280
to Thomas for coming on the show today and chatting with us about Academy.

932
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,960
Much appreciated, Thomas, for that.

933
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,440
So even though it's a little short today, we're going to wrap it up there.

934
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,640
I'll leave you with just a couple of bits of wisdom.

935
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,600
We would love to have you subscribe to the RSS feed if you're not already.

936
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,680
You can go to linuxunplug.com to get links to all the stuff we talked about, specifically

937
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,800
Linux Unplugged slash 263 for links that are specific to this episode.

938
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,960
But while you're over there, you can go to the subscribe page and you can get all the

939
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,600
different ways to get this here episode every week.

940
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,600
And there's a lot of them.

941
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,600
There are.

942
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,160
There's different podcast directories and whatnot.

943
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,080
We try to make it wherever you want to be so you can find all of those resources at

944
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,600
linuxunplugged.com.

945
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,200
In the meantime, we're out of here.

946
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,920
I'm going to go get checked up.

947
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,880
Wes is going to go surf the smog.

948
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,080
And then that gives everyone plenty of time to prepare their questions for Ask Noah.

949
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:35,080
That's right.

950
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:54,500
Be safe out there.

951
00:46:54,500 --> 00:47:17,060
Oh, it's the Unplugged Show.

952
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,060
The Unplugged Show.

953
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,460
Well it was the Unplugged Show.

954
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,460
Yo.

955
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,460
Yeah it's all done now isn't it?

956
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,540
I gotta, I gotta, I never sing on mic.

957
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,080
I don't know it's like it's instinctual because I'm like sitting here fiddling with buttons

958
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,780
and stuff and I'm, I can't help it.

959
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,300
Next episode I'll just bring a little ukulele, you can back you up.

960
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,300
We'll just embrace it.

961
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,420
Get the unplugged band going.

962
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,420
I like that idea.

963
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,420
I like that.

964
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:39,740
Well guys thank you for making it and it was really good to hear from all of you.

965
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:40,740
Appreciate it very much.

966
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,740
Sorry I had to cut it short this week but it's so hot in here it's actually not that

967
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,740
bad.

968
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,780
It's, if we're gonna cut it short this would be the week to do it I guess.

969
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,780
Perfect.

970
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:53,780
We'll see you next week.
