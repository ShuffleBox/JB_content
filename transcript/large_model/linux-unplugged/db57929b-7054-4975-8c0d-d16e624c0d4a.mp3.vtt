WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.040
Gotta say happy birthday before we start the show to Debian.

00:04.040 --> 00:06.420
Debian turned 23 today.

00:06.420 --> 00:09.900
Happy birthday, Debian, and we'll be talking more about it later in the show.

00:09.900 --> 00:12.340
They have a really cool timeline we'll be covering.

00:12.340 --> 00:13.760
It is Debian Day.

00:13.760 --> 00:16.720
Let's start the show, everybody.

00:16.720 --> 00:33.280
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 158 for August 16, 2016.

00:33.280 --> 00:38.080
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's celebrating Debian's 23rd

00:38.080 --> 00:39.080
birthday.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.080
My name is Chris.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.080
My name is Wes.

00:41.080 --> 00:42.080
Hello, Wes.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.200
I am really looking forward to today's show.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.000
We have a fun show lined up.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.680
We got a bunch of really, really good updates from the community we're going to get into.

00:49.680 --> 00:53.840
Mr. Sipes is here from, or formerly from, the Mycroft Project to give us an update on

00:53.840 --> 00:55.720
what he's doing.

00:55.720 --> 00:59.800
We have some really good Firefox news, which is the first time I've got to say that for

00:59.800 --> 01:00.800
a while.

01:00.800 --> 01:01.800
It warms my heart.

01:01.800 --> 01:02.800
It does, doesn't it?

01:02.800 --> 01:03.800
It feels really good.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.420
And then I'm going to throw a challenge in Wes's face to see if he can get something

01:06.420 --> 01:08.860
done by the end of the show.

01:08.860 --> 01:12.680
Then later on in the show, we're going to celebrate Debian's birthday by talking about,

01:12.680 --> 01:18.760
of course, what the future holds for Debian, and where Debian may be going, and where some

01:18.760 --> 01:19.760
of the places it's come from.

01:19.760 --> 01:24.040
And a little look at the Debian timeline, which is super fascinating.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.000
Really some good stuff to share with you guys.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.280
And then we'll wrap it all up and see how Wes does on the challenge.

01:29.280 --> 01:33.560
So the question is going to be coming in pretty soon, because rumors have it that your friends

01:33.560 --> 01:36.160
in Cupertino will be releasing a new MacBook soon.

01:36.160 --> 01:38.200
Hey, oh, it's been about time.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.900
Jeez, it is ridiculous.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.720
And you know what's going to happen.

01:42.720 --> 01:47.900
The current models, which are still perfectly usable, will go up on eBay, and people can

01:47.900 --> 01:50.560
buy them for a reduced price.

01:50.560 --> 01:53.520
And we have a pretty common question that comes into the show.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.320
How do you install Linux on the MacBook?

01:55.320 --> 01:56.320
Does it work?

01:56.320 --> 01:57.320
What should I know about?

01:57.320 --> 01:58.320
So this week-

01:58.320 --> 02:00.120
Is it worth the amount of effort that might be required?

02:00.120 --> 02:01.640
Have you ever done this before?

02:01.640 --> 02:06.840
You know, I have, but it's been, oh boy, probably three years at least.

02:06.840 --> 02:07.840
So this week-

02:07.840 --> 02:09.320
Actually, I was installing Debian.

02:09.320 --> 02:10.320
Really?

02:10.320 --> 02:11.320
That's great.

02:11.320 --> 02:15.520
I'm going to see if by the end of the show, Wes can get Arch Linux or maybe Fedora Linux,

02:15.520 --> 02:17.800
where we'll see, running on a MacBook.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.600
It's like a late 2013 model, I think.

02:20.600 --> 02:24.400
And we'll kind of give you a report of what it's like to try it, if he can get the dedicated

02:24.400 --> 02:28.920
graphics working, the wireless working, and we'll give you a review, so that way some

02:28.920 --> 02:30.400
people out there, they just want that hardware.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.960
And this is an old production rig that we have that's like, it's good.

02:32.960 --> 02:36.520
I'd like to see if you could leave macOS on there, because I think a lot of people are

02:36.520 --> 02:37.680
going to want to do that.

02:37.680 --> 02:41.360
Based on the emails we've received, people want to do a boot, and I can understand that.

02:41.360 --> 02:42.360
Yeah, absolutely.

02:42.360 --> 02:43.360
And if you want to do more updates-

02:43.360 --> 02:50.200
Wes, I officially am handing you this Linux-unplugged branded thumb drive, which contains the latest

02:50.200 --> 02:53.200
official released Antigros image from last month.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.680
Sure, it's signed with the JB signing.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.200
Oh yeah, I checked it for sure.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.200
Oh yeah, for sure.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.200
Absolutely.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.200
So there you go, Wes.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.200
Good luck to you.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.200
Thank you, sir.

03:01.200 --> 03:06.600
There is a, it is already partitioned into two separate, well there's the OS 10 partition,

03:06.600 --> 03:09.840
because I've played with Linux on there before, is like already shrunk down.

03:09.840 --> 03:13.040
And so there is like a, there's like right now I just made it like fat or something for

03:13.040 --> 03:14.680
you that you can mess around with.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.160
So there you go, Wes.

03:16.160 --> 03:19.480
The challenge is officially launched.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.400
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.640
Hey, before we go any further, let's bring in our virtual lug to dig through the community

03:24.640 --> 03:25.640
updates.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.640
Time appropriate.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.640
Greetings, Mumble Room.

03:27.640 --> 03:28.640
Greetings, program.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.400
Greetings, how's it going?

03:30.400 --> 03:31.400
Very good.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.400
Hello.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.640
I am excited to share this Firefox news story with you guys.

03:34.640 --> 03:38.440
So we put it right here at the top of the community updates.

03:38.440 --> 03:42.680
Firefox 49 for Linux is going to be gaining plugin free support for Netflix and Amazon

03:42.680 --> 03:43.800
streaming.

03:43.800 --> 03:44.800
This is super nice.

03:44.800 --> 03:48.000
No more crazy workarounds, no more depending on Chrome.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.680
I know a lot of Firefox users who have Chrome installed just so they can watch Netflix.

03:52.680 --> 03:53.680
So this is cool.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.400
And it's really another plugin biting the dust.

03:56.400 --> 04:00.160
They're using that Widevine, how do you say that?

04:00.160 --> 04:01.160
Widevine.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.160
Widevine.

04:02.160 --> 04:05.720
Widevine technology, which is created by Google, I believe, right?

04:05.720 --> 04:07.960
But Google has released it freely.

04:07.960 --> 04:11.800
And now Firefox will be integrating that and they specifically plan to publish support

04:11.800 --> 04:17.540
for Linux users in September in Firefox 49.

04:17.540 --> 04:18.540
That is great.

04:18.540 --> 04:20.080
That's a big equalizer.

04:20.080 --> 04:23.720
This and electrolysis is making Firefox look super attractive again.

04:23.720 --> 04:26.360
Those days where you're just frustrated with Chrome for whatever reason and you're like,

04:26.360 --> 04:28.320
oh, maybe I'll use something else.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.320
Firefox is getting there.

04:29.320 --> 04:36.160
For me, the story around how plugins and extensions have to be refactored to support electrolysis

04:36.160 --> 04:39.040
might still be the final decision.

04:39.040 --> 04:44.640
But I know both – have you – I know you've looked at Vivaldi before.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.520
I was going to say both you and I have messed around with Vivaldi.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.840
Yeah, I used it probably for a week or two.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.760
Yeah, I've recently looked into it.

04:50.760 --> 04:55.040
Mr. Tennell there in the Mumba room has been playing around with it.

04:55.040 --> 04:59.840
Michael, has it been specifically – like, has it gotten to the point where it's specifically

04:59.840 --> 05:03.600
ready to switch from Chrome and it solves some of your Chrome frustrations or is it – where

05:03.600 --> 05:05.240
is Vivaldi at in your testing so far?

05:05.240 --> 05:10.440
Well, I mean, actually, I don't like Chrome at all because it does a lot of things I don't

05:10.440 --> 05:13.880
like and I prefer Firefox over everything.

05:13.880 --> 05:19.840
However, everything that I didn't like about Chrome has been solved in some way in Vivaldi.

05:19.840 --> 05:25.680
So the things that I – if I went from Firefox to Chrome, I would lose a lot of features,

05:25.680 --> 05:31.040
but all – well, 99% of the features that I would lose are available in Vivaldi.

05:31.040 --> 05:36.480
So the transition wouldn't be as bad for me to go from Vivaldi – go to Vivaldi, but

05:36.480 --> 05:40.920
whereas Chrome would basically just not even remotely be an option for me.

05:40.920 --> 05:41.920
Okay.

05:41.920 --> 05:47.600
So the tab hibernation specifically is one of the most important things I've seen because

05:47.600 --> 05:52.840
I set up a tab stack where you can put a bunch of tabs into one tab and then you can hibernate

05:52.840 --> 05:53.840
that whole stack.

05:53.840 --> 05:54.840
Oh, that is nice.

05:54.840 --> 05:59.000
So you can take, like, 30 tabs and then hibernate them all so you only have, like, two active

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
and you can jump to them wherever you want to.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.360
Oh, all right.

06:02.360 --> 06:03.880
That's really nice.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.600
I have heard – I've read about their – I just never really thought about using it in

06:06.600 --> 06:07.600
that way.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.920
That is a pretty compelling use case for me.

06:08.920 --> 06:15.000
Vivaldi is going to switch to Feasible when they have a sync solution.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.640
Web sync and bookmark sync is pretty critical.

06:17.640 --> 06:22.280
Like if I'm upstairs and I'm working on a Google doc for a show today, I have a current

06:22.280 --> 06:25.960
shows folder in my bookmark toolbar that all of my docs for the shows that week that I'm

06:25.960 --> 06:30.180
working on, as I create that doc, I drag it down into this folder and that becomes available

06:30.180 --> 06:33.800
on my machines here in the studio and my machines in my office.

06:33.800 --> 06:37.700
Pretty important to me to have that feature and Firefox has pretty good sync now.

06:37.700 --> 06:40.320
So that's one of the reasons I keep eyeing Firefox.

06:40.320 --> 06:46.120
Michael, while you're kind of up and center right now, have you followed at all this theme

06:46.120 --> 06:48.600
pack that makes GIMP look more like Photoshop?

06:48.600 --> 06:52.920
It's something that's been around for a while but just recently got updated and it really

06:52.920 --> 06:56.600
makes GIMP look and – work and look a lot like Photoshop.

06:56.600 --> 07:00.960
And I don't know how I feel about it, but I'm wondering if you've tried it.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.680
I tried it a long time ago.

07:02.680 --> 07:08.240
I haven't tried the latest version, but it works in the sense that it brings the UI to

07:08.240 --> 07:16.480
a more usable state and not the absurd every tool is like hidden at the bottom of the columns.

07:16.480 --> 07:24.200
I like overall, but it's not really necessary because a lot of the things that it does is

07:24.200 --> 07:25.520
not that much different.

07:25.520 --> 07:30.680
Like it does a dual column tool set instead of a single column tool set.

07:30.680 --> 07:33.160
That's cool, but I really don't care.

07:33.160 --> 07:38.640
But the only thing that GIMP has a problem with in my opinion is the fact of where they

07:38.640 --> 07:41.760
put the tools options section.

07:41.760 --> 07:47.280
And this theme pack changes or whatever pack it's called, changes it and moves it to the

07:47.280 --> 07:48.280
top right.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.860
So it gives it a lot more prominence.

07:49.860 --> 07:54.240
So that one feature, that one change is probably enough for me to use it.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.240
Yeah.

07:55.240 --> 07:58.280
So it uses some of the same icons, but really a big for probably a lot of switchers is it

07:58.280 --> 08:01.280
uses some of the same keyboard shortcuts, which is –

08:01.280 --> 08:06.920
Oh, and that's the most important part of me for me because I have a – I've used Photoshop

08:06.920 --> 08:12.760
for so long that when I go to GIMP, I have to remember – I have to re-learn every single

08:12.760 --> 08:14.720
time all the shortcuts.

08:14.720 --> 08:15.720
Yeah.

08:15.720 --> 08:20.720
Ryan, I kind of wanted to get your thoughts on dragging old design paradigms and ways

08:20.720 --> 08:25.280
of using things from our proprietary days into open source projects.

08:25.280 --> 08:31.260
Is this encumbering GIMP in a way that sort of prevents it from sort of branching out

08:31.260 --> 08:34.560
into a different UI design even if it's bad by some people's comparison?

08:34.560 --> 08:37.720
Is there maybe a downside to doing something like this to open source?

08:37.720 --> 08:42.200
It seems like it doesn't feel like something that happens to proprietary commercial applications.

08:42.200 --> 08:47.640
I don't think it's bad just because a lot of my friends who have moved from Photoshop

08:47.640 --> 08:53.120
to GIMP oftentimes complain about things not being where they're accustomed to and that

08:53.120 --> 08:55.960
it's a lot harder to continue using it.

08:55.960 --> 09:01.280
So I tell them about these different things like GIMP Shop and I saw this the other day

09:01.280 --> 09:07.440
and sent it over to my dad who used Photoshop for years and years and years before adopting

09:07.440 --> 09:13.920
GIMP and he likes this type of stuff because it puts things in a place that he expects

09:13.920 --> 09:14.920
it to be.

09:14.920 --> 09:15.920
Yeah.

09:15.920 --> 09:16.920
That makes sense.

09:16.920 --> 09:17.920
Yeah.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.840
For my mom who's been a graphic artist and literally lived inside the Adobe applications

09:19.840 --> 09:25.780
for the last 25 years, this would be just – it's just simply a matter of like Rotten

09:25.780 --> 09:31.080
was saying, Mr. Tunnell, that it is a mapping that's to your – it's like a muscle memory

09:31.080 --> 09:32.080
mapping.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.080
How's the challenge going there, Wes?

09:33.080 --> 09:36.120
I noticed you're inserting the boot drive or the thumb drive for the first time.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.640
Have you been doing research ahead of time?

09:38.640 --> 09:39.640
I did a little bit of research.

09:39.640 --> 09:40.640
I've got it booted.

09:40.640 --> 09:41.640
I'm just – there's some –

09:41.640 --> 09:42.640
Oh really?

09:42.640 --> 09:45.640
Let's just say the word Broadcom is a factor.

09:45.640 --> 09:46.640
Yes.

09:46.640 --> 09:47.640
That is an issue.

09:47.640 --> 09:52.400
Now, I wonder if we don't have an easy way to get you Ethernet either.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.400
That's OK.

09:53.400 --> 09:54.400
I'm working on a –

09:54.400 --> 09:57.760
It wasn't at Apple's best wisdom to include an Ethernet adapter in their pro laptop.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.760
You see, that's silly.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.520
Those are so floppy drive.

10:01.520 --> 10:06.880
I think I might even have a USB adapters in my bag but hopefully I won't need it.

10:06.880 --> 10:11.640
I wonder if anybody in the Mamba Room is – moving on from GIMP.

10:11.640 --> 10:12.640
I think we probably said our piece.

10:12.640 --> 10:17.920
I wonder if anybody in the Mamba Room is an Internet of Things advocate or skeptic because

10:17.920 --> 10:25.400
this next story is I think extremely good news for an actual manageable Internet of

10:25.400 --> 10:27.240
Things world.

10:27.240 --> 10:28.780
This is a big deal for Canonical.

10:28.780 --> 10:36.720
They just struck a deal that is going to put Ubuntu on AdventX x86 based gateways and they're

10:36.720 --> 10:39.200
going to be certified to fully support Ubuntu images.

10:39.200 --> 10:44.680
Now these Internet of Things gateways I think are a pretty sound way to go because you have

10:44.680 --> 10:51.040
your various janky, cheap endpoints that are distributed throughout your house that you're

10:51.040 --> 10:55.360
probably going to be replacing every couple of years and you have all of that connect

10:55.360 --> 11:00.480
back to a central gateway device that proxies – oh god, it's weird to hear a Mac sound

11:00.480 --> 11:01.480
on the show.

11:01.480 --> 11:02.480
Sounds terrible.

11:02.480 --> 11:03.480
That is weird.

11:03.480 --> 11:04.480
So –

11:04.480 --> 11:05.480
I apologize everyone.

11:05.480 --> 11:08.080
I got a little shook up there.

11:08.080 --> 11:14.200
So it acts as sort of a central proxy to handle like you could manage a lot of these things

11:14.200 --> 11:17.120
centrally from there on your land before it even has to go out to the Internet.

11:17.120 --> 11:21.680
So for that particular device to be the sort of central communication point, to be running

11:21.680 --> 11:27.120
something like an Ubuntu image that is supportable and updatable and likely more secure than

11:27.120 --> 11:32.400
some sort of off-created embedded OS by some hardware manufacturer, I think this is a huge

11:32.400 --> 11:33.400
win for that.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.400
Oh, look at that.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.960
I didn't even know I had that shot.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.680
Well, that's pretty fancy.

11:37.680 --> 11:41.320
So does anybody in the Mumba room have any thoughts on this, on the Internet of Things

11:41.320 --> 11:49.920
in general and ways we could prevent a Armageddon where all mayhem has been unleashed on us

11:49.920 --> 11:54.280
because these devices are out of date and unpatched?

11:54.280 --> 11:58.240
I like the idea in general as long as I get to control what it runs.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.240
Yeah, yeah.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.240
Yeah, that's for sure.

12:00.240 --> 12:06.520
Yeah, what it runs and how up to date it remains and how easy that process is are all pretty

12:06.520 --> 12:08.000
key for me, I think.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Yeah, go ahead.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Yeah, yeah.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.000
Very nice.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Very nice.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Sorry.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.840
We all know that like a lot of this stuff right now, we set it and it never gets updated.

12:18.840 --> 12:25.640
And so, I mean, that world in which some of these things actually run a legit like operating

12:25.640 --> 12:33.720
system that's used in other products and actually gets updates, like that's a win regardless.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.560
I'm delighted to see Mr. Pope here.

12:35.560 --> 12:39.640
I'd be kind of curious to hear your thoughts, Pope, about this particular Git.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.040
It seems like a pretty good position.

12:41.040 --> 12:46.440
Just your personal thoughts on this market for Ubuntu as somebody who's watched the platform

12:46.440 --> 12:48.680
for a long time and maybe the Internet of Things in general.

12:48.680 --> 12:49.680
So hi, Pope.

12:49.680 --> 12:50.680
Welcome back to the show.

12:50.680 --> 12:51.680
Hello.

12:51.680 --> 12:52.680
And your thoughts, sir.

12:52.680 --> 12:53.680
Yeah, it's funny.

12:53.680 --> 12:57.480
You know the old, there's no such thing as the cloud, just other people's computers.

12:57.480 --> 12:58.480
Yeah.

12:58.480 --> 13:04.000
I saw someone do a tweet earlier, I think yesterday, that said, there's no Internet

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
of Things.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.280
It's just many unpatched, vulnerable, small computers on the Internet.

13:09.280 --> 13:10.960
And that is so true.

13:10.960 --> 13:17.040
And having a platform that is updated, you know, I worry that my home gateways, but not

13:17.040 --> 13:22.520
just home stuff, corporate environment, there are devices on corporate networks of all kinds

13:22.520 --> 13:26.440
which are not updated, not patched, not centrally managed.

13:26.440 --> 13:31.360
And I think it's great that we're making inroads in companies that are making these devices

13:31.360 --> 13:39.400
that allow them to be centrally managed and updated and secure and have apps via a store

13:39.400 --> 13:40.400
installed on them.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.400
I think it's great.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.840
You know, but Google would tell us that we need something like Fuchsia to make this possible.

13:44.840 --> 13:45.840
Yeah.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.160
Can you tell me where I can download that?

13:48.160 --> 13:51.960
Apparently in the future, that's where you can download that.

13:51.960 --> 13:52.960
Okay.

13:52.960 --> 13:53.960
I'll be waiting.

13:53.960 --> 13:57.560
Wimpy, are you a bit of a skeptic on these particular device categories in general?

13:57.560 --> 14:01.760
The only reason I don't mean to label you as a skeptic, but you and I have shared similar

14:01.760 --> 14:06.040
thoughts on the past in regards to VR, which also seems to have the same kind of hype smell

14:06.040 --> 14:08.920
to it.

14:08.920 --> 14:09.920
I don't think Wimpy's there.

14:09.920 --> 14:10.920
Yeah.

14:10.920 --> 14:11.920
Oh, there you are.

14:11.920 --> 14:12.920
Hello, sir.

14:12.920 --> 14:13.920
Hi, Wimpy.

14:13.920 --> 14:14.920
Oh, hello.

14:14.920 --> 14:15.920
Hello.

14:15.920 --> 14:16.920
Can you hear me?

14:16.920 --> 14:17.920
Yep.

14:17.920 --> 14:18.920
Hello.

14:18.920 --> 14:19.920
I think you just have a delay.

14:19.920 --> 14:20.920
Okay.

14:20.920 --> 14:21.920
Yeah.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.960
Oh, dear.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.680
That's unfortunate.

14:26.680 --> 14:31.160
Is this the alloy device you're referring to or something else?

14:31.160 --> 14:32.160
It is.

14:32.160 --> 14:35.160
I think it's actually a not-yet-released device by Advantech.

14:35.160 --> 14:41.080
So it's basically a full-fledged x86 computer, and I don't think it's a shipping product

14:41.080 --> 14:42.080
yet.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.080
Oh, right.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.080
Yeah.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.080
Advantech Embedded Computing Group.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.080
Now, Poppy, if you know anything different, you want to correct me, but I believe that's

14:47.080 --> 14:51.600
the case.

14:51.600 --> 14:57.920
I don't have an issue with these devices so long as they can actually run Linux of any

14:57.920 --> 15:05.360
flavor because then you're able to put a Linux operating system on it after whatever platform

15:05.360 --> 15:12.960
they've tried to build out of open source tools and things have sort of passed away.

15:12.960 --> 15:17.560
It's when you get these things where their thing that runs Linux is like a heavily patched

15:17.560 --> 15:22.920
version and they've never open sourced the patches back so you can't, you know, reutilize

15:22.920 --> 15:27.000
the device fully without having to reverse engineer a load of stuff.

15:27.000 --> 15:32.040
Or if they have like an image that they build once in a while, like they use Rootstock or

15:32.040 --> 15:37.420
Rootstock NG or something, which builds a root file system that they deploy on the device

15:37.420 --> 15:42.000
and then that's it, ships out with that and no one gets any updates unless there's some

15:42.000 --> 15:48.200
kind of deep lead technical user who will go and download the latest image and flash

15:48.200 --> 15:49.200
it on the device.

15:49.200 --> 15:53.280
If it's got no internal way of updating itself, I don't want it on my network.

15:53.280 --> 15:59.000
I would much rather have devices that can check in with a central server, get an update,

15:59.000 --> 16:02.400
make sure I've got the latest version of apps, latest version of the core operating system,

16:02.400 --> 16:03.400
whatever that might be.

16:03.400 --> 16:06.520
And yeah, I agree with Martin.

16:06.520 --> 16:11.440
If it ships with some form of Linux, then at some point I could potentially put some

16:11.440 --> 16:13.720
other form of Linux that's more secure.

16:13.720 --> 16:14.940
What an excellent point that is.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.720
I think that's exactly it.

16:16.720 --> 16:21.260
And maybe the meta story there is by enabling Ubuntu on this thing, it's opening up for

16:21.260 --> 16:26.180
people like us to tinker if we wish, but also giving regular consumers that just use it

16:26.180 --> 16:30.800
with the stock Ubuntu image a pretty fair shot at what seems so far to be a security

16:30.800 --> 16:31.800
disaster.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.580
So either way, it seems like a positive story for even non-Ubuntu users.

16:34.580 --> 16:36.920
So I'm pretty excited about it.

16:36.920 --> 16:37.920
I like that stuff.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.480
And it always felt like it was like, okay, we're going to get Linux on these devices,

16:40.480 --> 16:45.400
but it's not going to be a Linux we trust or a Linux we understand, so if this is real

16:45.400 --> 16:46.400
Ubuntu, that'd be great.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.720
Yeah, I know that.

16:47.720 --> 16:51.620
And I know how to Google for things about Ubuntu, and I know how to read Stack Exchange,

16:51.620 --> 16:53.360
and I can do things with this.

16:53.360 --> 16:56.720
And it kind of goes back to my hesitations with FreeNAS.

16:56.720 --> 17:01.400
I like the product, and here in my business I use it, but in my home, I kind of want something

17:01.400 --> 17:02.920
I feel safe.

17:02.920 --> 17:08.760
If I ever got the wild hair to tinker with, I want to be able to.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.600
And I feel like with FreeNAS, I break it.

17:10.600 --> 17:12.760
Yeah, with FreeNAS, I feel like I break it when I tinker it.

17:12.760 --> 17:16.560
But if it's something that's Ubuntu-based, I grok that user space.

17:16.560 --> 17:17.760
I know what I'm doing there.

17:17.760 --> 17:22.080
Okay, so before we continue on, oh, you busted out a USB Ethernet adapter.

17:22.080 --> 17:24.000
I did happen to have it in my bag.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Holy crap!

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Respect!

17:26.000 --> 17:32.840
So, okay, I'm guessing connectivity is a major issue, especially for something like Antigros,

17:32.840 --> 17:34.240
which requires connectivity to install.

17:34.240 --> 17:38.040
And I've noticed you've brought the thumbstick back to your Sputnik laptop.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.040
What's going on?

17:39.040 --> 17:41.680
Well, for some reason it's not booting now, so I'm checking the integrity really quick.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.680
I'm also copying the Broadcom driver onto a second USB stick.

17:44.680 --> 17:45.680
Oh, clever, sir.

17:45.680 --> 17:50.120
So I will then hopefully be able to reboot, install that driver, and get it installed.

17:50.120 --> 17:53.080
Okay, so Ethernet could be tricky.

17:53.080 --> 17:55.280
That's what I assumed.

17:55.280 --> 17:59.340
If we wanted to take out the wireless here at the JB1 Studios, you could go around the

17:59.340 --> 18:03.640
corner and there is an exceptionally long Ethernet cord that powers our wireless that

18:03.640 --> 18:04.640
you could bring it in here.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.760
And I don't think it would take out any of our production systems because they're all

18:06.760 --> 18:07.760
Ethernet.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.480
So, hopefully we will all...

18:09.480 --> 18:16.680
Yeah, by the way, I think if you're going to dive into the realm of Linux on the MacBook,

18:16.680 --> 18:22.440
if you want to do that, go get yourself a USB Ethernet adapter because that's going

18:22.440 --> 18:23.920
to come in super handy.

18:23.920 --> 18:29.480
All right, so we have more updates to get into, and I want to do that, and Mr. Sipes

18:29.480 --> 18:31.480
is here and we definitely want to talk to him.

18:31.480 --> 18:35.720
So before we continue, let's mention our first sponsor.

18:35.720 --> 18:38.520
And that's Ting, my mobile service provider, check them out.

18:38.520 --> 18:42.080
Go over there right now to linux.ting.com and you'll save on your first device or if

18:42.080 --> 18:46.480
you bring a compatible device, they'll give you $25 in credit for your first month.

18:46.480 --> 18:49.320
Now, that's probably going to pay for your first month because the way Ting works is

18:49.320 --> 18:54.540
you only pay for what you use and there's just a $6 fee for the line plus Uncle Sam's

18:54.540 --> 18:58.960
cut like a mobster and then your usage, just your minutes, your messages, your megabytes.

18:58.960 --> 19:02.360
In fact, they just recently lowered their data prices, which is phenomenal, makes them

19:02.360 --> 19:04.440
incredibly competitive.

19:04.440 --> 19:12.640
And they have a system where if you just want to use your device like a couple of times

19:12.640 --> 19:17.180
a month for a few calls, you could save a ton of money.

19:17.180 --> 19:23.400
But if you have a busy month where you're making tons and tons of calls, like for me,

19:23.400 --> 19:29.160
in April, I'm on the phone every day, sometimes two hours a day.

19:29.160 --> 19:37.020
And I have like one month on Ting that's like maybe, I don't even know, $55, $65, $75 depending

19:37.020 --> 19:40.180
on if I'm also using quite a bit of data or something.

19:40.180 --> 19:46.380
And then the other months, it's $24, $25, $26, $30, $35, $40 depending on my usage.

19:46.380 --> 19:50.120
It averages out to be an incredible savings over two years over $2,000 and you can get

19:50.120 --> 19:53.120
a feel for it too by using their savings calculator on their page.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.120
It's really nice.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.460
Unlocked devices, no contracts, no other termination fees.

19:56.460 --> 19:59.520
You can get simple feature phones that just make great calls and have a week-long battery

19:59.520 --> 20:00.520
life.

20:00.520 --> 20:02.680
Or you can go get the Cadillac Android devices and everything in between.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.200
You should check out some of their devices.

20:04.200 --> 20:05.200
They all come unlocked.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.200
You own that device.

20:06.200 --> 20:07.320
They're not going to get in the way of updates.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.080
They don't play that carrier game.

20:09.080 --> 20:10.380
I love it.

20:10.380 --> 20:13.840
And they're backed by two cows who have been around since the dot com boom.

20:13.840 --> 20:14.840
Think about that.

20:14.840 --> 20:18.000
Imagine that, making money on the internet since before the dot com boom and actually

20:18.000 --> 20:22.540
doing it in a way that's great because you get great customer service with Ting.

20:22.540 --> 20:23.600
Check them out at linux.ting.com.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.160
It's a better way to do mobile.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.160
I love it.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.740
Thanks, Ting, for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

20:29.740 --> 20:34.000
So Mr. Ryan Sipes is joining us, and you've heard him jumping in a few times.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.680
And you may have also heard the news this week that he has departed from Mycroft, the

20:38.680 --> 20:42.560
project that we have talked about a lot on this show, and I'm sure it must have piqued

20:42.560 --> 20:44.740
the interest of a lot of our audience.

20:44.740 --> 20:48.640
So Ryan, first of all, I just wanted to say thanks for coming on the show.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.360
And how are you doing?

20:50.360 --> 20:51.360
I'm doing great.

20:51.360 --> 20:53.960
I have a bit more free time on my hands.

20:53.960 --> 20:54.960
That's OK.

20:54.960 --> 20:55.960
Good.

20:55.960 --> 20:59.400
Well, we appreciate you spending some of that podcasting with us then.

20:59.400 --> 21:04.800
So I imagine that you've probably gotten a lot of questions and seen a lot of different

21:04.800 --> 21:06.280
discussions happening online.

21:06.280 --> 21:09.680
Is there anything in particular you wanted to address or any particular feedback items

21:09.680 --> 21:11.240
you wanted to touch on?

21:11.240 --> 21:17.240
Mostly, I just wanted to assure everyone that Mycroft is licensed under the GPL version

21:17.240 --> 21:27.880
3 and that as a result, regardless of my involvement, the project can continue and people should

21:27.880 --> 21:33.040
feel just fine using it and implementing it into their projects.

21:33.040 --> 21:40.040
And that's all I'm willing to say right now about it really specifically.

21:40.040 --> 21:47.520
I think that if people are keeping up with me online, you have my blog post pulled up

21:47.520 --> 21:56.920
there, to just stay tuned and I will kind of bring people into more of the mindset behind

21:56.920 --> 21:57.920
that.

21:57.920 --> 22:03.600
But I was really just ready to move on to other projects and this was the best time

22:03.600 --> 22:04.600
to do it.

22:04.600 --> 22:11.000
So Ryan, I kind of wanted to talk about you in a different context for a second.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.920
Do you remember how long ago it was that the Mycroft funding campaign launched?

22:15.920 --> 22:18.200
I mean, that was probably the first time I'd really heard your name.

22:18.200 --> 22:22.920
How long ago was that, do you think?

22:22.920 --> 22:24.920
It was September of last year.

22:24.920 --> 22:30.080
Okay, so it's not even been a year yet.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.680
Here's what's pretty damn astonishing about that.

22:32.680 --> 22:40.840
A year ago, I wasn't thinking a lot about open source artificial intelligence personal

22:40.840 --> 22:43.040
system devices.

22:43.040 --> 22:46.240
It was obviously something the big guys were thinking about.

22:46.240 --> 22:49.560
It wasn't really something on my radar, which I think was a mistake.

22:49.560 --> 22:55.800
And then also, I had never heard the name Ryan Sipes before and I didn't know you from

22:55.800 --> 22:56.800
Adam.

22:56.800 --> 23:05.200
And now here we are less than a year later and artificial intelligence and voice recognition

23:05.200 --> 23:09.840
and intent parsing are something that we talk about all the time.

23:09.840 --> 23:14.720
And Ryan Sipes is a name that many people are all of a sudden familiar with.

23:14.720 --> 23:21.720
And what I find to be extremely illuminating about this particular situation is, at least

23:21.720 --> 23:30.240
in my view, it seems to demonstrate how quickly the open source community recognizes good

23:30.240 --> 23:37.520
work and talent and how that really can propel you into the general discussion very quickly

23:37.520 --> 23:42.960
just simply based on technical merits and a project that people are interested in.

23:42.960 --> 23:49.840
And that is really one of the most, I think, interesting sort of side meta stories about

23:49.840 --> 23:57.600
you and Mycroft is how quickly you've become sort of a common technology that we are discussing

23:57.600 --> 24:02.880
simply because it sounds fascinating on its technical merits and what kind of that says

24:02.880 --> 24:04.800
about our community.

24:04.800 --> 24:10.640
And I'm kind of wondering, Ryan, if you reflect on sort of some of – if you could

24:10.640 --> 24:16.200
reflect for a moment on what that process has been like going from nobody knew your

24:16.200 --> 24:21.560
name really and maybe I'm wrong on that but I certainly really didn't to now you're

24:21.560 --> 24:26.400
making videos on YouTube about Mycroft, you're going to System76 and you're getting interviewed

24:26.400 --> 24:31.920
on podcasts, you're having to make blog posts when you quit a job and tweet about

24:31.920 --> 24:35.520
it and then all the follow up that comes from that.

24:35.520 --> 24:38.480
What the hell has that been like for you?

24:38.480 --> 24:44.480
So I have been into open source software for a long time.

24:44.480 --> 24:53.040
And so I was always watching and seeing people who I thought were much more technically talented

24:53.040 --> 25:01.480
than I was shaping the conversations around the future of open source and kind of what

25:01.480 --> 25:04.600
projects were rising to the top.

25:04.600 --> 25:15.880
I think that the thing that happens is that after a while of being in this community,

25:15.880 --> 25:23.080
you start to want to share your ideas and you start to want to contribute back to – I

25:23.080 --> 25:28.120
had never used a server – I had never set up a server until somebody finally was like,

25:28.120 --> 25:32.960
hey, check out Ubuntu in 2005 or whatever.

25:32.960 --> 25:38.520
And when I started using the desktop Ubuntu, well then that opened my mind up to Linux

25:38.520 --> 25:43.560
and at the time I remember I wanted to host a website and people were saying like, oh

25:43.560 --> 25:52.240
you have to use this version of Windows Server and I just was able to get acquainted with

25:52.240 --> 25:57.520
all this technology because of open source and so since then you want to pay it forward

25:57.520 --> 26:06.640
and I got the opportunity to do so by introducing lots of people to a new technology that is

26:06.640 --> 26:11.720
going to shape the future of computing in a lot of big ways.

26:11.720 --> 26:17.920
Now before then, I actually was in the Mumble Room a couple of times before Mycroft ever

26:17.920 --> 26:18.920
came around.

26:18.920 --> 26:23.200
I talked about Kansas Linux Fest.

26:23.200 --> 26:26.280
I think when I spoke for myself though, I'm really kind of meaning in the broader – like

26:26.280 --> 26:29.320
Ryan Sipes as a name is probably not something – I don't think there's probably as many

26:29.320 --> 26:32.720
people that were talking about you before something very technically interesting came

26:32.720 --> 26:34.480
along that you were involved with.

26:34.480 --> 26:35.480
Right.

26:35.480 --> 26:38.480
Yeah, exactly.

26:38.480 --> 26:49.640
But now because of my experience at Mycroft, I am very happy to be able to use kind of

26:49.640 --> 26:56.120
the microphone that's given me to share other projects that I think that the open source

26:56.120 --> 27:00.740
community should be gathering around and should be aware of.

27:00.740 --> 27:03.560
One of these things is machine learning.

27:03.560 --> 27:04.560
Absolutely.

27:04.560 --> 27:07.320
That's an enormous opportunity.

27:07.320 --> 27:16.400
It's an enormous – it's an enormous just space that's going to blow up and we should

27:16.400 --> 27:17.400
be able to take advantage of that.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.400
We'll need something there.

27:18.400 --> 27:22.960
And the proprietary people are there now and will continue to be there so we need to be

27:22.960 --> 27:23.960
there too.

27:23.960 --> 27:24.960
Yeah.

27:24.960 --> 27:31.600
And there are projects like TensorFlow from Google and Cafe from Yahoo and a few others

27:31.600 --> 27:32.600
–

27:32.600 --> 27:33.600
You mean Verizon.

27:33.600 --> 27:34.600
– that are open source.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.600
Yeah, exactly.

27:35.600 --> 27:46.960
But I'm really excited to kind of go forward from here and continue to help shape maybe

27:46.960 --> 27:53.080
like open source AI and personal assistance.

27:53.080 --> 27:57.920
After a lot of self-reflection, I just found that I might have a better opportunity to

27:57.920 --> 28:03.880
do that on my own at this point.

28:03.880 --> 28:11.060
There are other projects that I hint at getting involved in in my blog post and I would love

28:11.060 --> 28:14.120
to come back and talk about them and share some things.

28:14.120 --> 28:21.840
I think that one of them the community will be familiar with and it's just a project

28:21.840 --> 28:24.960
that hasn't gotten a lot of play that I think is really important.

28:24.960 --> 28:30.200
And then there are some other ones that I'd like to talk about and see if we can't get

28:30.200 --> 28:35.800
some collaboration.

28:35.800 --> 28:39.120
But yeah, it's been a crazy wild ride.

28:39.120 --> 28:45.440
I met a lot of people who I considered to be celebrities including you, Chris.

28:45.440 --> 28:52.680
And it was kind of crazy when I posted the blog post to get calls from people who a year

28:52.680 --> 28:58.480
ago if you said that they were going to give me a call out of the blue, I would have told

28:58.480 --> 29:02.840
you that's just not possible, it's not going to happen.

29:02.840 --> 29:07.400
And so it's been a wild ride and it's not over.

29:07.400 --> 29:11.760
I think that there's so much more that I can do for the open source community.

29:11.760 --> 29:15.880
I think that there's so much more that we as a larger community, the Jupyter Broadcasting

29:15.880 --> 29:21.800
community, the Linux community can do and I'm excited to be a part of that.

29:21.800 --> 29:22.800
Absolutely.

29:22.800 --> 29:25.160
Yeah and you are always welcome to come and contribute to the shows because I always love

29:25.160 --> 29:29.680
hearing your take on stuff and I know you reflect on this stuff quite a bit and I've

29:29.680 --> 29:33.280
always sort of enjoyed following what you do and I'll continue to do so.

29:33.280 --> 29:35.080
So thanks for joining us, Ryan.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.880
And thanks for having me on.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.400
Maybe some of you guys can help explain this next story to me.

29:39.400 --> 29:40.400
Wes, I'm looking at you.

29:40.400 --> 29:42.920
I know you're in the middle of a challenge right now.

29:42.920 --> 29:47.880
But this sounds like a bad thing and I want you to talk me off the ledge, okay?

29:47.880 --> 29:51.960
Fake Linus Torvalds keys have been found in the wild and we need to knock it off with

29:51.960 --> 29:54.900
the short IDs ASAP.

29:54.900 --> 29:59.120
Apparently it's well known that PGP is vulnerable to short ID collisions and many experiments

29:59.120 --> 30:00.480
have been done to demonstrate that.

30:00.480 --> 30:07.760
But what I didn't know is that keys, fake keys, fake PGP or maybe GPG keys I guess,

30:07.760 --> 30:16.240
have been found for Linus, for Greg KH and other kernel developers in the wild recently.

30:16.240 --> 30:17.240
Holy shit!

30:17.240 --> 30:18.300
This seems bad to me.

30:18.300 --> 30:21.000
This seems like NSA Russia kind of hacking China bad.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.800
Well, it's really more just –

30:22.800 --> 30:23.800
Talk me down, Wes.

30:23.800 --> 30:27.240
You really shouldn't be using these short keys.

30:27.240 --> 30:30.360
A project called Evil 32 to try to demonstrate this.

30:30.360 --> 30:36.200
They took the web of trust, the usual one that you'll use if you are using PGP keys.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.200
Right.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.200
Yeah.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.200
Say that five times fast.

30:39.200 --> 30:43.280
Then they computed all of these brute force, you know, using GPUs and it looks like some

30:43.280 --> 30:46.840
people have been taking their publicly available files and uploading them to some of the key

30:46.840 --> 30:50.160
servers and so then people looking for them have found these.

30:50.160 --> 30:53.200
So it does sound bad.

30:53.200 --> 30:57.580
It is bad but we also know that these are not equivalent – they do not provide the

30:57.580 --> 31:00.880
kind of identification, the kind of security that we expect from them.

31:00.880 --> 31:04.240
PGP, GPG keys, don't do with the short IDs.

31:04.240 --> 31:06.520
Anybody else in the moment have any takes on the story because this is kind of one of

31:06.520 --> 31:11.600
those thick ones that it seems like something we know but probably the issue would be there's

31:11.600 --> 31:14.840
stuff out there already that is signed with these short keys.

31:14.840 --> 31:15.840
Short IDs, I guess.

31:15.840 --> 31:20.400
And I don't know if anybody else has insights in the Momba Room but that's our take on

31:20.400 --> 31:21.400
it.

31:21.400 --> 31:22.400
Yeah.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.400
Go ahead.

31:23.400 --> 31:33.320
So I don't think this actually is bad for the normal users of Linux but more on people

31:33.320 --> 31:37.880
that maintain distros and if they don't check it well then it's bad.

31:37.880 --> 31:41.240
Oh, good point.

31:41.240 --> 31:44.280
That is exactly who needs to be paying attention to this story.

31:44.280 --> 31:45.280
Well said, Mr. Z.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.280
Well said.

31:46.280 --> 31:47.280
Thank you.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.280
That is a really good point.

31:48.280 --> 31:55.280
I wanted to mention something that I think was well said and started a conversation that

31:55.280 --> 32:01.140
I think probably wasn't necessary but I wanted to give a shout out to Ninja Aaron who 23 hours

32:01.140 --> 32:05.600
ago created a Linux action show subreddit post saying a quick comment about the ButterFs

32:05.600 --> 32:11.680
coverage on the latest Linux action show and that's where we discussed the fact that the

32:11.680 --> 32:16.680
official ButterFs project Twitter account recommended people use ZFS or ZFS.

32:16.680 --> 32:17.680
That's pretty wild.

32:17.680 --> 32:21.680
That was wild and our story was really about the reaction to that but you know he makes

32:21.680 --> 32:22.800
a great point.

32:22.800 --> 32:29.220
He says that ButterFs is definitely having its issues but he makes a couple of good use

32:29.220 --> 32:36.440
case for ButterFs in this post and I guess I did want to mention like I'm not necessarily

32:36.440 --> 32:41.920
opposed to the idea of people that want to use ButterFs on their laptop that has an SSD

32:41.920 --> 32:42.920
drive.

32:42.920 --> 32:48.940
I don't really think ButterFs is like the devil file system.

32:48.940 --> 32:56.000
Really where I have an issue with the ButterFs advocacy, it really comes down to when people

32:56.000 --> 33:00.040
try to advocate that it should be used in a business slash enterprise setting, however

33:00.040 --> 33:04.200
you want to describe that.

33:04.200 --> 33:10.720
I started in IT in the year 2000, about – well actually really – actually that's not

33:10.720 --> 33:11.720
true.

33:11.720 --> 33:17.520
1997 was when I actually officially got paid in IT when I was – I was at that time desktop

33:17.520 --> 33:18.960
tech support.

33:18.960 --> 33:22.920
But one of the things that I had to – there was – I had two challenges over my career

33:22.920 --> 33:29.080
that were very much about data retention and then I had many challenges beyond that but

33:29.080 --> 33:34.200
there were some that were very particular legally mandated, very, very, very carefully

33:34.200 --> 33:41.620
audited use cases that I can't even really go into and in these scenarios, back then

33:41.620 --> 33:48.000
we used very, very cutting edge file systems that were very risky, mostly because that

33:48.000 --> 33:50.560
was all that was available at the time.

33:50.560 --> 33:55.640
And so it's not that I'm also like some holier than thou soapboxer who says oh you

33:55.640 --> 33:57.640
should never use ButterFs because you're a lunatic.

33:57.640 --> 34:01.240
I mean I've been the guy that's been putting in a file system that's a little edgy in

34:01.240 --> 34:02.240
production.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.620
I have on a lot of my systems.

34:03.620 --> 34:11.000
But there is sort of – I guess there is sort of this – it feels to me like there

34:11.000 --> 34:15.480
is this failure to look within a bit to sort of self-analyze and say we've made a mistake

34:15.480 --> 34:16.480
here.

34:16.480 --> 34:19.840
And so I wanted to acknowledge that while I have been sort of anti-ButterFs in the last

34:19.840 --> 34:24.140
few weeks as there's been more flaws, I also think there's many useful use cases

34:24.140 --> 34:29.780
for it and I wanted to give a shout out to Mr. Ninja Aaron for kind of very well stating

34:29.780 --> 34:34.960
that case and making me reflect on it a bit and go – I myself if I – actually for

34:34.960 --> 34:38.400
this MacBook here, I would absolutely consider ButterFs on there.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.440
You should have said that like two minutes ago.

34:40.440 --> 34:41.440
No, it's fine.

34:41.440 --> 34:42.440
What did you get?

34:42.440 --> 34:45.040
You're getting the XT4 just because I figured you wouldn't mind if it was a safe and solid

34:45.040 --> 34:46.040
choice.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.040
I don't mind.

34:47.040 --> 34:48.040
No.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.040
So you're actually that far, huh?

34:49.040 --> 34:50.360
So that means you got wireless working.

34:50.360 --> 34:51.360
Oh yeah.

34:51.360 --> 34:52.360
Ah.

34:52.360 --> 34:55.320
Now that wireless fix – this is one of the interesting things though is that wireless

34:55.320 --> 34:59.360
fix will not persist once you reboot into the main OS after it's been installed.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.360
No.

35:00.360 --> 35:03.960
But maybe I'll be smart enough to root into and install that preemptively.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.960
Thank you for the reminder.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.760
Damn it.

35:08.760 --> 35:12.080
You know Wes, I'm actually pretty impressed that you got the Wi-Fi working without any

35:12.080 --> 35:13.560
other connectivity.

35:13.560 --> 35:15.120
So what did you do?

35:15.120 --> 35:16.120
What did you do?

35:16.120 --> 35:19.760
So this is going to be – the number one challenge is these MacBooks – any recent

35:19.760 --> 35:22.160
MacBook doesn't have an Ethernet port.

35:22.160 --> 35:24.680
And everybody that's going to be doing this is going to run into this problem where they're

35:24.680 --> 35:26.560
not going to have Wi-Fi when they get in a live environment.

35:26.560 --> 35:29.880
So what did you do to enable networking without having a connection?

35:29.880 --> 35:34.280
Well I had conveniently – we're installing Antigros here and I had an Arch Linux little

35:34.280 --> 35:35.560
laptop right here.

35:35.560 --> 35:42.800
So I just ran make package, built the package, copied it on a USB drive, installed it, mod

35:42.800 --> 35:45.720
probed the broad cam drivers and away we went.

35:45.720 --> 35:46.720
Well played sir.

35:46.720 --> 35:47.720
Which I was very pleased.

35:47.720 --> 35:48.720
Everything worked perfectly.

35:48.720 --> 35:49.720
Well played.

35:49.720 --> 35:50.720
Network manager picked it right up.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.000
We were on the network.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.000
Damn.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.360
And also I'm impressed that you remembered the Wi-Fi password too because I didn't tell

35:56.360 --> 35:59.120
you what that was and you still – good job.

35:59.120 --> 36:02.640
Anybody have thoughts on ButterFS in the mumble room before we move on to just a quick shout

36:02.640 --> 36:03.640
out I have?

36:03.640 --> 36:07.320
I'll just say I'm excited for BcacheFS.

36:07.320 --> 36:10.200
We'll see when that's actually usable but –

36:10.200 --> 36:13.840
Is that a B-tree kind of like RAM based?

36:13.840 --> 36:14.840
Yeah.

36:14.840 --> 36:15.840
Yeah.

36:15.840 --> 36:16.840
Okay.

36:16.840 --> 36:17.840
All right.

36:17.840 --> 36:18.840
Tease me a little bit.

36:18.840 --> 36:19.840
Let's see.

36:19.840 --> 36:20.840
There's actually a Patreon for it.

36:20.840 --> 36:21.840
Are you serious?

36:21.840 --> 36:22.840
I mean maybe throw it.

36:22.840 --> 36:23.840
Wimpy why are you looking forward to it?

36:23.840 --> 36:24.840
Let's throw it right there.

36:24.840 --> 36:25.840
Oh my god.

36:25.840 --> 36:26.840
Okay.

36:26.840 --> 36:27.840
Maybe that'll explain it better than I could probably.

36:27.840 --> 36:39.120
Well Bcache is something that I've used to accelerate spinning drives by putting a Bcache

36:39.120 --> 36:48.040
partition on solid state to effectively create sort of a level two cache.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.040
This is great.

36:49.040 --> 36:54.000
And the authors behind Bcache realized that they were very close to actually having a

36:54.000 --> 36:56.280
full lock file system.

36:56.280 --> 37:01.920
So they're going the next step to implement it as a copy on write file system.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.240
They only have 38 patrons.

37:03.240 --> 37:05.920
I feel like maybe we could bump that up a little bit for them.

37:05.920 --> 37:11.720
So it's going to be a copyright on write file system like ZFS or Butterfess.

37:11.720 --> 37:13.240
They aim for good performance.

37:13.240 --> 37:17.240
They say significantly better than existing copy on write file systems comparable to the

37:17.240 --> 37:19.120
performance of Extended 4 or XFS.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.120
Hello.

37:20.120 --> 37:21.120
See we really need this.

37:21.120 --> 37:22.120
We're just embarrassing ourselves.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.120
Oh wow.

37:23.120 --> 37:27.680
Metadata and data checks on multiple devices including replication and other types of RAID,

37:27.680 --> 37:31.560
caching, compression, encryption, snapshots and scalable.

37:31.560 --> 37:35.260
It's been tested up to 50 terabytes and will eventually scale higher.

37:35.260 --> 37:40.200
We'll be working on stable with a small community of users.

37:40.200 --> 37:42.640
This is super exciting.

37:42.640 --> 37:46.360
And what I really like about it is and this is where I was trying to get to in the conversation

37:46.360 --> 37:51.040
on Sunday but I think I went off track is Butterfess when you look at the model almost

37:51.040 --> 37:57.240
seems like this funding model makes a lot of sense.

37:57.240 --> 38:02.300
It's just they would need way more support because it really is a full time job.

38:02.300 --> 38:04.800
It is a lot of work to do this properly.

38:04.800 --> 38:08.200
But this is this is great.

38:08.200 --> 38:12.280
So Bcash I'll put a link to the Patreon in the in the show notes so that could be really

38:12.280 --> 38:13.280
cool.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.280
I'll check it out more after the show.

38:14.280 --> 38:16.840
Has anybody tried it out?

38:16.840 --> 38:17.840
Just watching it?

38:17.840 --> 38:18.840
I have not now.

38:18.840 --> 38:19.840
Hmm.

38:19.840 --> 38:20.840
Hmm.

38:20.840 --> 38:21.840
Wimpy what would be your use?

38:21.840 --> 38:22.840
I've not tried it.

38:22.840 --> 38:23.840
But one day.

38:23.840 --> 38:24.840
One day.

38:24.840 --> 38:25.840
Yeah.

38:25.840 --> 38:30.840
As a principal file system on laptops for example.

38:30.840 --> 38:31.840
Yes.

38:31.840 --> 38:34.400
Oh could you imagine something like that.

38:34.400 --> 38:39.440
The features of that if we had OK so here's why it's a big deal.

38:39.440 --> 38:41.200
Here's why we need to get this right.

38:41.200 --> 38:46.040
So one of the things that true OS is that out that they're changing the name of true

38:46.040 --> 38:47.040
OS.

38:47.040 --> 38:48.040
Is that a is that an official thing.

38:48.040 --> 38:51.720
I hope I didn't anyways.

38:51.720 --> 38:52.720
Is that a thing.

38:52.720 --> 38:54.320
This is BSD unplugged.

38:54.320 --> 39:01.320
So PC BSD has the Lumos desktop environment and they they've done a lot of work on their

39:01.320 --> 39:07.000
file manager to integrate ZFS snapshots and backups and multiple versions into the file

39:07.000 --> 39:12.720
manager and that is honestly the level that we need to get at with the Linux desktop.

39:12.720 --> 39:18.280
And until we really kind of land on something until we really sort of solidify something

39:18.280 --> 39:21.400
like this we're not going to have it integrated to the desktop level like that.

39:21.400 --> 39:25.200
There's no way until it has mass adoption that's going to happen.

39:25.200 --> 39:29.360
And definitely one of the advantages that the PC BSD guys has is if you're going to

39:29.360 --> 39:33.240
go with it if you there they have one file system choice that supports all this stuff

39:33.240 --> 39:38.200
and that's ZFS and they can plan for that and they can exactly and it's the same advantage

39:38.200 --> 39:42.480
that once Apple gets off their ass and they finally get APFS working they'll do that and

39:42.480 --> 39:44.040
they'll integrate into time machine.

39:44.040 --> 39:48.760
And to be honest with you in some ways NTFS has been kicking our ass for a couple of years

39:48.760 --> 39:49.760
with shadow copy.

39:49.760 --> 39:54.760
I mean shadow volume copy has really saved my ass a couple of times when I was in IT

39:54.760 --> 39:59.900
and I it's one of the reasons why I wanted to use ButterFS here on our server that runs

39:59.900 --> 40:04.440
our VMs because it I mean it saved my ass a few times.

40:04.440 --> 40:09.880
So there is one story I want to talk about before we go any further into the show because

40:09.880 --> 40:14.160
last week I kind of offhandedly mentioned the Humble Bundle and was sort of like dismissive

40:14.160 --> 40:16.680
with their only three games that supported Linux.

40:16.680 --> 40:22.600
And then this week Humble Bundle 17 went live and all of the games all of the games in this

40:22.600 --> 40:26.640
bundle support Linux so I just I wanted to follow up on that because I gave them kind

40:26.640 --> 40:30.960
of a hard time last week and then they totally delivered this week with Humble Indie Bundle

40:30.960 --> 40:31.960
17.

40:31.960 --> 40:35.360
This is the Humble Indie Bundle and all the games freaking support Linux.

40:35.360 --> 40:36.360
That is awesome.

40:36.360 --> 40:40.280
Yeah if you pay more than ten dollars you get Nuclear Throne which is I think yeah I

40:40.280 --> 40:42.040
think that's one of the games I wanted.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.040
So we have a link.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.280
Octodad nice always a classic.

40:45.280 --> 40:47.680
I like that OMG Ubuntu has been writing about this too.

40:47.680 --> 40:48.680
Yeah that's nice.

40:48.680 --> 40:49.680
I think it is.

40:49.680 --> 40:52.160
I like that they're posting more over there they kind of slow down for a while and it

40:52.160 --> 40:55.120
seems like they've picked it back up and I think that's nice because it feels like there's

40:55.120 --> 40:56.720
a lot going on these days.

40:56.720 --> 41:00.680
It feels like things in some ways it's August and the news is slow but at the same time

41:00.680 --> 41:03.960
there is a lot of really we're on the precipice of the interesting things really hitting us

41:03.960 --> 41:07.920
and so that stuff is beginning to arrive and if you're watching closely like like that

41:07.920 --> 41:11.440
terminal we talked about that there are things beginning to land.

41:11.440 --> 41:14.480
It's like an incubation period right now and there's stuff happening it's kind of just

41:14.480 --> 41:16.200
not visible and soon it'll be popping up.

41:16.200 --> 41:19.160
And it feels like they're doing a decent job of percolating some of that stuff up and some

41:19.160 --> 41:24.660
of the stuff like the GIMP theme or arc theme stuff like that it's also just kind of nice

41:24.660 --> 41:26.940
as a daily driver it's nice to have that kind of stuff.

41:26.940 --> 41:31.680
So hats off to Joey over there for seemingly picking it up recently and really doubling

41:31.680 --> 41:35.480
down on content that I've been enjoying reading even as a non Ubuntu user I still find it

41:35.480 --> 41:39.160
kind of interesting which is got to be kind of a challenge for a site called OMG Ubuntu

41:39.160 --> 41:40.160
right.

41:40.160 --> 41:44.760
Hey before we go any further I'll tell you about a challenge I have and that is every

41:44.760 --> 41:48.520
time I need to do something it feels like I got to get a new computer well that's where

41:48.520 --> 41:53.360
DigitalOcean came in I am able to spin up a server in less than a minute now and that

41:53.360 --> 41:57.040
is a game changer for me when I want to try something out I spin up a droplet when I want

41:57.040 --> 42:00.120
to put something in production I use a droplet and when I want something just for family

42:00.120 --> 42:02.560
members I use a droplet.

42:02.560 --> 42:05.840
DigitalOcean is simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

42:05.840 --> 42:10.000
for you to spin up your own server on their kick ass infrastructure they have SSDs throughout

42:10.000 --> 42:14.240
the entire thing they got data centers all over the world they have multiple data centers

42:14.240 --> 42:19.000
in multiple cities they have private networking amongst your servers in certain areas which

42:19.000 --> 42:22.920
is a really cool feature and I'm just going to put this out there I have not actually

42:22.920 --> 42:26.980
done this yet but I'm going to admit Alan has been teasing me you could do a little

42:26.980 --> 42:30.660
free NAS thing on that back end now that they've got block storage you've got ZFS you could

42:30.660 --> 42:36.640
also do Ubuntu 16.04 with a little ZFS action and then do the back end block storage or

42:36.640 --> 42:42.160
you know what if you want to go crazy you could probably there's probably I mean it's

42:42.160 --> 42:46.960
block storage you could use butter fs2 yes you could you really could it's kind of fun

42:46.960 --> 42:51.160
because it's a it's SSD backed and you just attach it as you need it's on demand their

42:51.160 --> 42:55.240
pricing starts at five dollars a month and if you use our promo code and this is kind

42:55.240 --> 42:59.520
of nice if you use our promo code do unplugged you get a ten dollar credit and then you can

42:59.520 --> 43:03.240
try it out two months for free they have a really nice interface they have a super sweet

43:03.240 --> 43:07.360
API that tons of open source codes already been written around and I got to tell you

43:07.360 --> 43:12.160
now I've been using it I don't know a year and a half I'm not sure how long I've been

43:12.160 --> 43:17.120
using digital ocean but almost every week I've spent up a droplet at least for a little

43:17.120 --> 43:21.680
bit try something out and then destroy it and on occasion I keep it in production and

43:21.680 --> 43:25.880
I've been I've been really sort of changing the way I think about computing like when

43:25.880 --> 43:30.440
we wanted to start streaming on demand to a certain certain outlets that prefer you

43:30.440 --> 43:35.840
only stream when you are actually live it made sense to just take an existing configuration

43:35.840 --> 43:39.320
and sort of improve upon it and spin up a new droplet on demand using their API and

43:39.320 --> 43:42.600
then we just pay for it while we're using it it really is like it's like infrastructure

43:42.600 --> 43:47.640
on demand and it's it feels like 2016 you combine that now with their great tutorials

43:47.640 --> 43:51.420
and the huge community around it and the fact that not only do they run Linux on their entire

43:51.420 --> 43:55.400
infrastructure but they back a lot of the projects that we talked about in some capacity

43:55.400 --> 44:01.840
or another and a lot of the folks that we talked to interact with digital ocean in a

44:01.840 --> 44:07.920
way that I don't know if digital ocean really promotes properly because like there's been

44:07.920 --> 44:11.120
projects that have come along them and been sort of desperate for hosting and digital

44:11.120 --> 44:16.080
ocean has provided it to them for free and or worked out deals with it's not publicized

44:16.080 --> 44:19.160
very widely and the other thing like when they decided to bring on core OS is one of

44:19.160 --> 44:23.760
their distributions and and free BSD and those are just the two since they've been sponsors

44:23.760 --> 44:27.000
that I've had like some information about and so I'm not sure what they did in the past

44:27.000 --> 44:31.800
probably similar is they actually contact the upstream distribution and say we want

44:31.800 --> 44:35.520
to work with you we don't we they don't just like go grab the ISO image and make it work

44:35.520 --> 44:38.400
they're like we're gonna work with you on this let's get this going it's pretty cool

44:38.400 --> 44:41.920
that's very cool so use our promo code do you unplugged and a big thank you to digital

44:41.920 --> 44:46.400
ocean for sponsoring the program you know Chris if you didn't have a handy Arch Linux

44:46.400 --> 44:50.800
laptop you could there are some scripts out there to convert your droplets to Linux you

44:50.800 --> 44:55.000
could compile your you'd make do your make packages up there yeah that is something people

44:55.000 --> 44:58.720
could look into because it's Paul I think it's mostly made possible because they're

44:58.720 --> 45:04.280
kick-ass console yeah exactly so I want to talk about Debbie and today's its 23rd birthday

45:04.280 --> 45:08.540
and maybe we could talk about the future of Debbie in a little bit I wanted to reflect

45:08.540 --> 45:12.720
on something for a moment before we get any further this is from swampy over it does market

45:12.720 --> 45:20.080
where a YouTube account it's a video of Linus at Deb comp 14 which was in Portland which

45:20.080 --> 45:25.440
I think I think JB live stream to this I don't remember so I probably could have played from

45:25.440 --> 45:28.920
my own clip archive but credit to swampy for that for this clip here I'll start with something

45:28.920 --> 45:37.640
non-controversial no no I'm fine with controversial that's not usually my problem it's well known

45:37.640 --> 45:41.400
around these parts that in 2007 you did an interview where you said that although you've

45:41.400 --> 45:46.820
used many Linux distributions you had never used Debian because you found it difficult

45:46.820 --> 46:03.040
to install yes have you tried it since no that was quick so I'm sure it's gotten much

46:03.040 --> 46:09.800
easier to install it to me a distribution is I'm sorry you may want to close your ears

46:09.800 --> 46:15.680
now a distribution is not very interesting I wanted to be easy to install so that I can

46:15.680 --> 46:22.160
just get on with my life right which is mostly the kernel the closest I got to installing

46:22.160 --> 46:31.320
Debian was there was one machine I forget which one it was it may have been the MacBook

46:31.320 --> 46:39.720
Air that actually had trouble installing something and and Debian the installer would boot but

46:39.720 --> 46:44.320
then it didn't install there either and eventually I figured out what was the problem with that

46:44.320 --> 46:49.760
machine but but by then it was too late if there's a way to break installing an operating

46:49.760 --> 46:53.480
system I've found it multiple times and if there isn't one you already know if I found

46:53.480 --> 47:00.760
it and Debian last time super easy highly recommended trying maybe I should try I mean

47:00.760 --> 47:08.160
one of the problems I have is I am not an MIS person I mean I may do kernels and people

47:08.160 --> 47:13.360
think that that means that I'm technical but when it comes to actually maintaining machines

47:13.360 --> 47:19.400
I am a complete disaster it makes me feel better right it's funny that he's like so

47:19.400 --> 47:24.440
caught up making and well maintaining the kernel yeah you know the actually running

47:24.440 --> 47:31.440
of the yeah not that interesting okay that's fine Debian is one of my first Linux eyes

47:31.440 --> 47:36.840
it wasn't my first Linux eye but it was my mostly impressed it was the one I was most

47:36.840 --> 47:40.400
impressed by and the one that saved the day for us the most when we first started using

47:40.400 --> 47:46.040
Linux oh yeah and I so I don't know if it wasn't for Debian I don't know if if I would

47:46.040 --> 47:49.280
be a Linux user today really yeah well maybe I mean it might have still happened but I

47:49.280 --> 47:53.280
think it was definitely major seems to have been a rock-solid choice early on so that

47:53.280 --> 47:58.280
kind of people could latch on to it yeah yeah so I boy I really I really am really thankful

47:58.280 --> 48:04.040
to Debian because we had definitely tried it was old Red Hat it was way way before Fedora

48:04.040 --> 48:08.000
it was way way long time ago like Red Hat four and five and we were trying some of this

48:08.000 --> 48:12.840
stuff and when we were trying to do things like get the most current version of squid

48:12.840 --> 48:16.560
and it's funny to even talk about Debian in the context and getting a more current version

48:16.560 --> 48:20.120
but yeah literally our Red Hat distribution it shipped with a really ancient version of

48:20.120 --> 48:25.120
squid and Debian with apt-get made squid setup and then the other thing that was really nice

48:25.120 --> 48:30.400
about Debian is after after you installed a package via the internet which by the way

48:30.400 --> 48:36.640
back in the 90s that was magic that was magic that was that was unbelievable and it also

48:36.640 --> 48:41.960
still supported CDs which was great because we needed those and so to be able to install

48:41.960 --> 48:46.040
squid but then the next thing after installing squid where it would bring up like an end

48:46.040 --> 48:52.120
curses interface and ask me questions about what I want and and then to make it so easy

48:52.120 --> 48:56.440
to do that and set up email server that and they setting up an email server on Debian

48:56.440 --> 49:02.460
word nobody made it as easy and quick and then continued to keep it secure and up-to-date

49:02.460 --> 49:06.440
like Debian did it was just you could rely on the fact that they were so slow and they

49:06.440 --> 49:09.920
took so long to upgrade that you're gonna get a solid five years out of that machine

49:09.920 --> 49:13.960
and and you with solid updates and probably longer and then when you did ask gonna run

49:13.960 --> 49:18.080
and then when you did have to dist upgrade after five years or six years it was gonna

49:18.080 --> 49:24.600
work and that was that was what that made Linux so a safe bet for me and it made it

49:24.600 --> 49:30.200
it made it possible for us to fix major networking problems that we had so I I have a really

49:30.200 --> 49:34.920
soft spot for Debian then obviously it's sort of the the proto distro that so many things

49:34.920 --> 49:39.040
have so many things have come from and if you look at if you look at the success that

49:39.040 --> 49:43.200
Ubuntu has had and the on the cloud and all of that and the fact that those origins come

49:43.200 --> 49:47.600
from Debian it's really it's kind of incredible so I wanted to open up the mumble room and

49:47.600 --> 49:53.680
say hey guys what are your thoughts on maybe where Debian as a project itself is gonna

49:53.680 --> 50:00.680
go in the future where where does this where does the next five ten maybe even twenty years

50:00.680 --> 50:05.060
where does Debian go and I wanted to give the mumble room time to ping me in the chat

50:05.060 --> 50:08.600
room with their you know who wants to ever go so West while we while we give them time

50:08.600 --> 50:12.640
to let us know where they and it could be quick or long have you reflected on this at

50:12.640 --> 50:15.360
all since you know you and I were kind of chatting about this do you think Debian is

50:15.360 --> 50:19.920
gonna continue to be a dominant player in this space is it gonna continue to just be

50:19.920 --> 50:25.080
sort of the the foundation what's the next few years look like for Debian in your mind

50:25.080 --> 50:30.620
I'm kind of uncertain I've played with Debian 8 I've used it to run like free switch for

50:30.620 --> 50:35.960
example where there's some good like ansible recipes and other things that are freely available

50:35.960 --> 50:39.740
and I mean I find it a relatively pleasant environment they've got system D now it seems

50:39.740 --> 50:43.800
like you know it's pretty standard they have a huge amount of software available the Debian

50:43.800 --> 50:48.560
8 release is still very current the software there is you know good for most needs they've

50:48.560 --> 50:53.480
got their own PPA system in the works in the works I have not played with that or tried

50:53.480 --> 50:59.320
any of that but you know it's coming you know what I haven't looked at it's like it's like

50:59.320 --> 51:04.520
snap D that kind of thing that would be interesting as well but it does seem like a good place

51:04.520 --> 51:08.160
to run software but I don't know what I what I don't know and what I'm curious to hear

51:08.160 --> 51:13.520
from everyone else is what's the what's the enthusiasm like are people looking for it

51:13.520 --> 51:17.120
is it like when you're just looking to run the Linux for some reason does Debian leap

51:17.120 --> 51:20.960
to your mind should it leap to your mind well you know I'm gonna I see so Ryan's tagged

51:20.960 --> 51:24.780
me but first I'm actually gonna I'm gonna jump it over to wimpy just for a second because

51:24.780 --> 51:29.000
I have an idea where I feel like Debian is gonna grow a lot in the next five years and

51:29.000 --> 51:33.200
that's Raspbian at the Raspberry Pi and I'm wondering what wimpy thinks about that is

51:33.200 --> 51:37.840
you know because that's also a super popular trajectory for Ubuntu Mate it seems like a

51:37.840 --> 51:44.880
likely a likely continued area of success for Debian what are your thoughts wimpy I

51:44.880 --> 51:53.480
I think that's a little bit awkward actually because Raspbian isn't really part of the

51:53.480 --> 52:01.280
Debian community and I think Raspbian would do well to more closely align itself with

52:01.280 --> 52:09.600
Debian rather than sort of be an offshoot with its own repository sort of bolted on

52:09.600 --> 52:17.200
top so this is not a Debian issue more a Raspbian issue I would definitely like to see Raspbian

52:17.200 --> 52:22.760
become more closely aligned with Debian so maybe in the future there isn't a Raspbian

52:22.760 --> 52:28.920
there is just a Debian and everything you need to power everything on the Pi is in Debian

52:28.920 --> 52:37.900
proper rather than this sort of thing yeah and you know if you're absolutely right and

52:37.900 --> 52:41.320
if I'm right that this is gonna be a continued area of success for Debian that is just gonna

52:41.320 --> 52:46.480
get even more awkward that is really something that's a great point wimpy Ryan I want to

52:46.480 --> 52:51.180
give you a chance to jump in what do you think do you think there's gonna be another distro

52:51.180 --> 52:55.960
that will ever be surpassed as like the proto distro in this next few I mean this seems

52:55.960 --> 53:01.600
to be a solid spot for Debian right now yeah I think that you're right I if I pull out

53:01.600 --> 53:11.920
my crystal ball and I look at it though I think that we see we see like let's look at

53:11.920 --> 53:18.940
Ubuntu for instance sure I right now everything's based on Debian I don't know how long that's

53:18.940 --> 53:25.320
gonna last I think for the foreseeable future that's a for sure thing but the but I could

53:25.320 --> 53:31.680
see them since they've gained so much prominence in in the cloud and and across you know when

53:31.680 --> 53:36.420
you're deploying stuff there's so many people would just say yeah I deploy Ubuntu you know

53:36.420 --> 53:40.840
and they don't even think twice they just use whatever configuration management tool

53:40.840 --> 53:45.920
that they're gonna use on their cloud and just bang it's like spun up 20 machines yeah

53:45.920 --> 53:50.720
all running a workload and what's crazy is you see more and more of those running you

53:50.720 --> 54:02.200
know Docker images and like it it makes me wonder how long is it until until the until

54:02.200 --> 54:09.920
the Ubuntu guys say like hey they want to go a different direction than we do why don't

54:09.920 --> 54:16.120
we finally begin to break our reliance on them will snap be the press the thing that

54:16.120 --> 54:20.880
pushes it over the edge there perhaps interesting I think it's possible yeah sweet Lou as a

54:20.880 --> 54:25.360
user you say you don't really see a big difference between Debian and Ubuntu so do you just sort

54:25.360 --> 54:34.320
of default go Ubuntu yeah I've tried some Debian base some other Debian based OS's before

54:34.320 --> 54:41.320
and to me they just really didn't seem all that much different other than not you know

54:41.320 --> 54:53.440
a usable place to install stuff from you know besides one that begins with an S there I

54:53.440 --> 54:58.400
would say I would say yeah from a user usability perspective that's absolutely the case mini

54:58.400 --> 55:03.540
Mac you make the point that you kind of view Debian as a having a special role in the open

55:03.540 --> 55:09.560
source community yeah I see the Debian devs or the technical committee as somehow the

55:09.560 --> 55:16.440
moral authority hmm you remember the set of s discussion or adaptation of system D yeah

55:16.440 --> 55:22.920
I mean the work of Debian developers has still some impact yeah absolutely yeah you know

55:22.920 --> 55:27.760
geez mini Mac good point if we reflect on the system D discussion it really seems like

55:27.760 --> 55:32.960
there was a massive change in the discussion she's that bad thing I know there was a there

55:32.960 --> 55:39.360
was a big pivot when Debian when Debian decided to go system D and then when Debian did some

55:39.360 --> 55:45.760
of the legal legwork to make ZFS possible you immediately saw Ubuntu able to jump on

55:45.760 --> 55:52.080
that and those are two huge huge technology issues and social issues quote unquote in

55:52.080 --> 55:58.760
the Linux community that Debian was sort of the deciding authority on it's a great point

55:58.760 --> 56:04.040
what it what an interesting position for them to be in and and you know it also makes me

56:04.040 --> 56:08.480
think a little bit reflect a little bit on Ian Murdock and makes me miss him a little

56:08.480 --> 56:13.920
bit so there you go that is boy if if you want to play with something kind of neat and

56:13.920 --> 56:17.160
by the way mom or you still have a few chance a few minutes left or a minute left to jump

56:17.160 --> 56:20.720
in if you want but if you want to look at something kind of neat and the history of

56:20.720 --> 56:25.840
the Debian project we have timeline debian net linked in the show notes and you can scroll

56:25.840 --> 56:30.560
through this and look at some of the major activity in the Debian project over the years

56:30.560 --> 56:36.400
major milestones like Deb camps and huge bugs that were like news stories and first alphas

56:36.400 --> 56:40.480
and then of course the final beta really final releases and the betas and all that kind of

56:40.480 --> 56:44.400
stuff and also things like the the bug squashing parties in Cambridge and you kind of get a

56:44.400 --> 56:50.640
sense for the Debian project at a larger scale it's pretty neat and sees that you can also

56:50.640 --> 56:55.080
get a sense that there's still plenty of 2016 left to be filled out on that map and plenty

56:55.080 --> 56:59.000
of the future for Debian goes way back this is I don't know what tech they're using to

56:59.000 --> 57:04.480
generate this does it say it's really neat though yeah it's this tiny font down there

57:04.480 --> 57:07.840
I can't quite read it it's at the bottom you see how small that font is at the bottom of

57:07.840 --> 57:13.940
the page dang but somewhere down there probably tells you what they're using so happy birthday

57:13.940 --> 57:19.120
to Debian guys it's it's really cool we're really happy to have something like you around

57:19.120 --> 57:29.240
for so long so hats off and we give the as the special winners award to you yeah that's

57:29.240 --> 57:34.040
for Debian right there just for you guys all right so I want to get to the how the challenge

57:34.040 --> 57:40.080
is going and the reasons why this challenge was actually concocted in the first damn place

57:40.080 --> 57:43.400
and while you'll probably be hearing more about it pretty soon if I were a little bit

57:43.400 --> 57:51.080
of a crystal ball rubber what what did you what did you say crystal ball rubber Linux

57:51.080 --> 57:55.180
Academy comm slash unplug that's where you go to learn more about Linux Academy and support

57:55.180 --> 58:00.400
this show Linux Academy is a platform to learn the core fundamentals around Linux and then

58:00.400 --> 58:06.860
the stack around although I built on top of it as your AWS open stack Docker Python that

58:06.860 --> 58:10.680
all that stuff in that ecosystem that you hear about all the time that feels like our

58:10.680 --> 58:14.700
big major nebulous topics that you're not really quite sure where you'd ever even get

58:14.700 --> 58:19.480
started Linux Academy helps you put it in perspective and get it done Linux Academy

comm slash unplugged where you go to support this show try it out they'll put you in the

58:24.120 --> 58:28.580
middle of a real world scenario so you walk away with experience they have instructor

58:28.580 --> 58:32.920
mentoring when you need it they have customized learning plans that can adapt your availability

58:32.920 --> 58:37.980
even when you're super ass busy and as somebody who owns his own business and as a father

58:37.980 --> 58:43.400

58:48.820 --> 58:53.980
comprehensive study guide there's real value there participate in their note card system

58:53.980 --> 58:59.940
which is actually a pretty great experiment you might call it and enjoy their virtual

58:59.940 --> 59:03.880
labs which spin up on demand when you need them and give you SSH access with distributions

59:03.880 --> 59:08.500

59:08.500 --> 59:13.500
the world of certs this is a great resource Linux Academy comm slash unplugged in a big

59:13.500 --> 59:18.580
thank you Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program looks Academy comm slash

59:18.580 --> 59:25.500
unplugged okay Wes I heard you rebooting during that spot I heard you how's it going it's

59:25.500 --> 59:29.360
installed now we're working on getting it to show up in the bootloader you have a preference

59:29.360 --> 59:34.100
do you want refined do you not I don't know I don't know what's what's the difference

59:34.100 --> 59:38.900
this is this is all new to me I mean you can get it to work with the native EFI bootloader

59:38.900 --> 59:43.580
that seems good okay but you can also install refined which is kind of just a nice better

59:43.580 --> 59:47.780
what would make it easier to get the Nvidia graphics working because that's that's part

59:47.780 --> 59:51.060
of the question that's part of the question because I think that's like a kernel boot

59:51.060 --> 59:55.100
parameter because otherwise I think it uses the Intel graphics by default I believe so

59:55.100 --> 01:00:01.020
I want to talk about why this is happening because this is some crazy bull crap I mean

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:08.100
I actually I will be in full disclosure I will be honest with you the number one question

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:12.580
we have ever gotten into the Linux action show and Linux unplugged and I am literally

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:19.320
talking since episode one over a decade ago of Linux action show the number one question

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:25.220
we have gotten is how do I get Linux working on a MacBook and we answer it from time to

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:30.260
time but we never really fully go into it and so we're it's one of these things that

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:34.140
we're simply sick and tired of getting the question asked and so we just don't address

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:41.380
it a lot and I was I was I've been using the entryware Apollo as my daily driver at

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:48.960
home pretty much since my review and absolutely loving it and it is light right the battery

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:54.100
lasts for hours it's it's it's small enough that I can carry it and just bring it to work

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:58.700
when I need it not have to worry about bringing the power adapter and it's it is a very nice

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:04.920
machine and I have all my stickers all over it with I just I really enjoy it but then

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:11.940
No Man's Sky came out and that damn game I can't help but love it and it requires open

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:19.700
GL 4.5 support and SSE 4 I think and basically dedicated graphics and that's where the MacBook

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:24.940
came in yeah and I connected with okay so I sort of visualize myself as an audience

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:29.180
member I've either bought a used MacBook I've inherited a MacBook or I'm sick and tired

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:34.700
of Mac OS and Apple is not getting around updating this thing no and one of the things

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:38.180
that I know from previous testing experience is that Linux runs a hell of a lot faster

01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:43.900
on the MacBook than OS 10 does so the fact that this is a 2013 is going to feel it's

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:47.500
going to feel I estimate under Linux probably going to feel like a brand new machine like

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:51.420
it's probably gonna feel very fast I mean it's got the PCI SSD in there it's got dedicated

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:58.180
said not about using f2FS or whatever yeah it's got dedicated Nvidia graphics it's it's

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:03.140
got a it's got a wonderful retina screen on it it's it's a really it's a pretty nice laptop

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:06.900
is a nice lap and people generally accept that the MacBook is built well so the question

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:11.460
has always been how reasonable would Linux be on the MacBook because my intention is

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:17.300
I know this sounds ridiculous is to then install wine and then install No Man's Sky I eventually

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:22.120
I plan to also put OBS on there and do some broadcasting from because it does have a four

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:27.340
core processor as well sure yeah that would work well yeah so that's where that was sort

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:32.300
of the impetus for myself to want to try Linux on the MacBook and then that sort of sent

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:35.940
us down the path of trying to figure out well what do you need to know before you put Linux

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:38.220
on a MacBook and it definitely seems to be one of the things you have to get your head

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:44.500
around is what model of MacBook do you have and this is somewhat not obvious since Apple

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:50.180
just calls everything MacBook and if you have Mac OS on your system you can actually entertain

01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:53.660
this by going into the about back system and I have a screen I have a screenshot of this

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:57.500
in the show notes you go in there and it'll tell you like it's a late model something

01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:03.820
something you Google MacBook Pro late model 2013 and it will tell you the specific like

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:08.620
model number is like it's 11 comma 2 or something like that right West of my yes I believe so

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:12.140
yeah and there's like other ones like older ones are like you know different so it's it's

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:17.460
it's a major model number comma minor model revision and you find that you can find like

01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:21.260
arch wiki entries which for mine I've linked in the show notes that specifically tell you

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:26.660
about the little kind of esoteric tweaks you have to make to make it work on your particular

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:31.680
MacBook model and I as I look at this I think this could be a this could be a really great

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:36.580
Linux box if if all of this works out so I'm kind of really interested to see where it

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:41.100
goes I'll try the Thunderbolt out and then I can report back to the audience on on some

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:46.100
of my adventures with it I also was kind of wondering I was kind of wanted to pick Wimpy's

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:49.540
brain and ask him if he hears many people in the Ubuntu Mate community that are running

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:53.380
it on the MacBooks because that also crossed my mind as a possible distro if we couldn't

01:03:53.380 --> 01:04:02.340
get arch working yeah it does crop up from time to time mostly in discussions in the

01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:07.220
Ubuntu Mate community and if it's something that you're interested in doing then that

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:14.700
is the place to first search because it's a discourse so you can find the right discussions

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:20.980
easily and if your model hasn't been discussed then start a new thread and there are a few

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:29.900
people in there that can assist you with that it doesn't come up a lot it comes up a bit

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:36.420
but not not loads it's certainly not a major platform I'm seeing people use Ubuntu Mate

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:41.020
on I good I don't know I just don't at this point I don't know if I feel like recommending

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:46.460
it although maybe I'll feel differently after we try this I do see it as like it could so

01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:54.060
a couple of things have changed recently first of all based on some of my reading the roadblocks

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:58.980
of getting the wireless working the Broadcom wireless have been significantly reduced but

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:03.660
the big change which is in the more recent kernels been around for a little while now

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:09.860
but if you depends on your distro there is built-in kernel level support with the synaptics

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:14.580
driver for the MacBook touchpad or trackpad or whatever you want to call it and that was

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:18.380
something that used to be a sticking point on my particular model have you had to do

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:21.820
anything to get the trackpad working or has it been working no it's just been working

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:26.540
I mean it's not quite as nice as the default one but I've got scrolling I've been impressed

01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:33.380
the media keys have working even in live media what about the I can see the high dpc I support

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:37.220
gnome working nicely really you can see the tiny text on the console boot up and then

01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:41.020
yeah once you've got to the login screen really did gnome just automatically go high

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:47.980
dpi mode yeah no way really yeah at least in the integration now what about the keyboard

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:54.360
backlight that's a great question is that working can you turn that on oh yeah and it

01:05:54.360 --> 01:06:01.300
even has the like scrollable menu shut up really yeah wow that's actually pretty look

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:05.340
at gnome like kicking ass on that thing yeah so are you in the ins are you in the live

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:11.260
media right now are you in the installed meet ls well now I'm in the installed OS actually

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:14.780
I have to review how how it actually got here I was just kind of troubleshooting that but

01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:21.700
I rebooted again and I expected it to go into Mac OS X but it went right into yours so this

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:24.340
is really going to be nice to be able to play no man's sky at home if you get this working

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:30.020
with pretty excited I did a after tech talk yesterday I did a let's play with I guess

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:34.000
that's what I would I guess that's what the kids call it I did a let's play with my son

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.840
Dylan who is a huge minecrafter and there's definitely minecraft elements in no man's

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:43.940
sky and so it was a lot of fun you know he's seven years old so he gets to experience some

01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:47.700
of the stuff like kid does it's a lot of fun to experience it through a kid's eyes and

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:50.460
I think I'm going to post the let's play if you guys want to see it for the patrons at

01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:54.620
patreon.com slash today yeah so before we get out of here anybody else have thoughts

01:06:54.620 --> 01:07:00.260
about the Mac books or actually I know mr. to know they're in the mumble room wanted

01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:09.020
to also say give a little bit of love towards the Zen books are you still in there I think

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:13.080
you had to know I think you laugh but he wanted to say if you're looking at Mac books you

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:16.740
should consider the Zen books I think I probably summarized what he was going to say he had

01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:21.860
particular models in mind but okay he would say check out the Zen books so do you want

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:24.420
to continue on and we'll and then we'll just wrap up the show then we can cover in the

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:30.440
post-show how that sounds great okay all right so that brings 158 to a close Ryan thanks

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:34.020
a bunch for coming and man you are welcome to join us any week you have time is we're

01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:37.420
always live at this time so it was good to hear from you and I definitely look forward

01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.580
to what you're doing in the future where should people follow you if they want to kind of

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:48.140
stay tuned sure yeah they can follow me on Twitter at Ryan Lee Sipes R-Y-A-N-L-E-E-S-I-P-E-S

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:51.380
and thanks for having me on Chris I love it you bet man and why don't you link that in

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:54.780
the IRC so that way I can easily throw it in the show notes too so that way people can

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:59.580
lazy web that and sure they don't have to worry about spelling all right that brings

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:05.900
us to the end of this week's unplugged I tell you what Wes I'm damn impressed I think you

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:12.900
have so far essentially completed every damn ridiculous challenge I've thrown at you during

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:17.020
the show almost anyway coming close well I mean this is pretty much in there I think

01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:22.620
the dedicated graphics is within your reach man hopefully I am okay all right if you'd

01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:26.460
like to show up live it's a lot of fun join us over at jblive.tv go to Jupiterbroadcasting.com

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:29.940
slash calendar to get converted to your local time zone don't forget to follow me at Chris

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:34.620
LS and at Jupiter signal for the network LinuxActionShow.reddit.com is where you go for feedback and we'll

01:08:34.620 --> 01:09:01.780
see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:27.980
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:33.100
All right JBtitles.com thank you everybody it was a fun show I really enjoyed that and

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:38.820
also sincerely happy birthday to Debian I really appreciate Debian I mean it's not only

01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:43.460
has it been the basis of some of my most enjoyed and used OS's and continues to be the basis

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:48.180
for my favorite server platform Ubuntu but also I think it really was a big part of why

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:53.340
I got into Linux so thank you thank you Ubuntu thank you mumble room thank you chat room

01:09:53.340 --> 01:10:00.460
now let's go boat all right so where you at with that thing I've got it booting I'm making

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:08.740
sure the bootloader is actually working and getting the Wi-Fi back up nice all right let's

01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:15.700
see about that proprietary drivers JBtitles JBtitles so this is this is a MacBook with

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:21.940
an Nvidia chip in it yes yeah I think it's a 750 I think or a 760 and is this a new

01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:27.860
computer or one no no it's a it's a it's one that I used back in like before I think even

01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:34.820
before I hired Rekai for editing and then once Rekai came on board he had 50m ok 750m

01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:39.540
he got the dedicated Mac and then this sort of became like every time I wanted to do a

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:43.760
comprehensive video editing project this is my machine I would go to and still do to some

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:48.100
degree but I've been transitioning to KDN live more and more so I've had this sitting

01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:53.620
around and it's a late 2013 model that I and I actually think with an old Mac book you

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:57.620
have a better success rate with a slightly older model which is kind of bears out why

01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:00.420
I think you'll probably see more of these showing up on eBay when the new model comes

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:04.480
out because it's literally been too long and so they'll probably people throw their old

01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:09.500
models on eBay and you might have Linux users who want a particular build a quality of a

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:15.980
machine grabbing these and snapping these up perhaps so this is a pro 15 or some description

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:24.740
is it yes yeah it's a it's a late 2013 MacBook retina 15 inch with the 750m and the 1 terabyte

01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:33.900
SSD PCI SSD and 16 gigabytes of RAM and West did you decide on a bootloader well right

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:38.340
yeah right now it's just using the built-in EFI so like when you hold down the option

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:41.780
key or whatever it is the that's what I'm working on confirming interesting but we might

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:49.140
just install refined yeah look at you look at you it would be interesting to compare

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:54.780
battery life between the systems no TLP installed and awesome that would really interest me

01:11:54.780 --> 01:12:01.820
yeah I absolutely think this is not well optimized for the well I to be fair the cards are definitely

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:07.780
stacked against Linux however I was reading the arch wiki and it appears that LM sensors

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:13.780
now has some support but see I honestly the core issue I've never really been super compelled

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:21.400
to do this is the way Max are built they are Intel machines absolutely but they use a completely

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:27.100
different power management and cooling management architecture than a standard desktop PC and

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:31.940
honestly if I were Apple I would too because a CPI and all of that is just total shit so

01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:37.620
what Apple did is they created the SMC controller and the absence SMC controller is both hardware

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:42.620
and software and the software component is only available in Mac OS 10 and there's no

01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:47.780
open source equivalent to it because Apple holds all of the information and the SMC controller

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:55.140
is used by Mac OS 10 to escalate the fans with CPU usage so the OS is constantly monitoring

01:12:55.140 --> 01:13:01.000
the demands and predicted demands the predicted demands if you can if you can even believe

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.900
that of the OS workload based on your average workload and it preemptively throttles the

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:11.020
thermal management of the Mac based on whatever metrics that Apple can has come up with with

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:16.420
their black magic and there's just literally no way to translate that to Linux or Windows

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:20.380
it's the same problem for boot camp users who decide to run Windows 7 to 10 on their

01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:27.580
Mac hardware they have the same exact issue and in the past what I had done is I got a

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:33.820
program called SMC control and SMC control is a Mac OS program what you do is you can

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:39.820
use SMC control to hard set your fans to a certain RPM so that way at least there's

01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:44.620
some thermal cooling because otherwise what happens is without the SMC controller kicking

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:51.220
in via software ignition then the thermal limits of the actual hardware are what did

01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:52.220
take the fan usage.

01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:53.220
Yeah that's what you want.

01:13:53.220 --> 01:13:57.740
No so when you actually get to the full thermal limits of the Intel i7 processor that's when

01:13:57.740 --> 01:14:01.860
the fans cool when you get to the thermal limits of the GPU that's when the fans kick

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:08.780
on so by using SMC controller in Mac OS 10 I could set the fans at a steady like 5500

01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:13.700
RPM or 4000 RPM depending on my workload and then restart in the Linux.

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:19.500
If you shut down then the SMC controller reset and so if I booted from a cold boot right

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:25.140
into Linux I have no fan control but if I would first boot into Mac OS and then use

01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:29.740
SMC control which is a third-party utility that only supports most Macs and then use

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:34.660
that to set the fan and then reboot from that into Linux I could have proper thermal management.

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:38.980
So one of the things that appears to have changed since I had to do that rigmarole was

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:45.460
LM sensors appears to have some capacity to control the thermals on the MacBook now and

01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:50.620
so that could make a significant difference in battery life and it's absolutely an area

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:54.620
I'm gonna test versus Mac OS whatever the current release is.

01:14:54.620 --> 01:15:03.900
So I was just looking on eBay in the UK at that spec and they still sell used for around

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:06.340
£1,200 which is about $1,500.

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:07.900
Isn't it amazing?

01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:12.860
See I think Apple has always managed to have super good resale because they only at best

01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:15.020
release a model a year it seems.

01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:22.380
So you just if it's on it's sort of it's sort of like there's by their by their apparent

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:27.940
nonchalant attitude towards their hard Mac hardware customers they have created a very

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:36.540
robust aftermarket value for the MacBook but a but every time a new one comes out everything

01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:38.160
shifts down a bracket.

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.980
So that I believe this MacBook will probably shift down to about $800 once the new MacBook

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:47.140
comes out in September and this a Core i7.

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:50.540
Is that still a current model even though it's been around for a few years?

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:55.580
No no no no but because but the current model will shift down a price range and because

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:59.260
this is a model or two below the current model it'll this is going to come down significantly

01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:01.300
to about $800.

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:02.300
That's my estimation.

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:05.260
I could be totally wrong but that seems to be the history is because this is like two

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:09.460
models or three models behind this is going to be the this is going to be the real bottom

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:17.460
basement like still get an i7 still get Thunderbolt still get Retina still get PCIe storage but

01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:21.820
under $1,000 easily will be this I believe that'll be the price of this machine and

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:26.260
at that price range it almost becomes reasonable to experiment with Linux on it and just see

01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:30.480
well what the hell because I you know I it's a it's a six to eight hundred dollar MacBook

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:33.620
depending on spec and at well at the end of the day if it doesn't work I could just do

01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:37.560
Mac OS 10 with Linux and VMware and so I think you're gonna have a lot of Linux users that

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:42.420
will pick this thing up because they the cult of hardware worship around the MacBook they'll

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:46.360
pick this thing up they'll try putting Linux on it and so I was like this is probably something

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:48.460
that I'm gonna get a whole new wave of emails about.

01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:52.740
I'm kind of preemptively getting that yeah.

01:16:52.740 --> 01:16:59.100
And you're only excited about Linux on Mac because the hardware is decent.

01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:04.820
Well mostly what it's come down to is I want to start doing more remote broadcasts and

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:09.300
I need a pretty powerful system to run OBS because what I need to do is I need to bring

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:13.580
in I need to bring in a couple of RTMP streams I need to send out an RTMP stream and I need

01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:20.600
to record so I'm probably gonna look at and so something that's for cores is probably

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:27.200
going to be necessary soon for me on the go and the problem is is OBS is available for

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:34.820
Mac OS 10 and if I'm not careful because of simple practical demand and need of production

01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:39.640
I might accidentally use OBS on Mac OS I have to be careful it's like it's like somebody

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:43.740
who's an alcoholic I don't want to be around people that are I gotta I gotta make sure

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:47.680
that if we have Linux on this thing I just continue to use Linux so it's sort of preemptively

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:52.900
preparing for that it's also because I now want a Linux machine at home that has a dedicated

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:57.740
graphics card and that's kind of the big driver for me personally is all my Linux machines

01:17:57.740 --> 01:18:04.340
at home are Intel graphics and that's been fine but now that I want to play No Man's

01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:10.020
Sky at home it it's since I already have the hardware it's not like I'm buying the hardware

01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:13.980
if I if this was me buying it I would never do it but because I already have the hardware

01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:21.940
it seems like it's worth trying yeah definitely right and Linux does seem to run pretty damn

01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:27.980
fast on it like it's it's it's a it's interesting you know Apple's gotten a really bad rap for

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:30.380
how long it's been since they've updated the Mac books and I've been one of the people

01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:37.060
giving a hard time but this is the 2013 it still feels pretty damn fast it's once you

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:42.900
go SSDs and core i7 and all that it's a lot of but then it comes down to if you need things

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:47.220
like quicksync or other or or you know would be nice as a is a is a nicer graphics card

01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:51.660
like a 980 or something yeah that would be nice yeah or even a 1080 yeah a 980 I'm in

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:57.080
my new intro where oh oh yeah how is the best you have the Athena don't you how has that

01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:03.540
been going for you you it's epic yeah yeah honestly wimpy if I had the money if that

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:08.260
that would be my preferred route to go hands down absolutely see I feel like I can get

01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:13.060
in with I can get within a stone's throw distance of something like the Athena with the MacBook

01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:19.220
that I already own but I would yeah so are you running are you running a like a like

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:25.060
a like a like a multiple boot environment on this thing or is it just one distro I are

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:30.300
you game tell me all about it oh you can probably guess the name um I would I bet I bet I could

01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:39.220
yeah yeah no it's just one destroyed yeah where's it's got it that's it yeah yeah no

01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:45.900
it's um one distro so one one uh root disk which is an NVMe uh drive nice and then I

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:55.700
have uh two one terabyte um SSDs in there one is mounted as my home partition so just

01:19:55.700 --> 01:20:01.780
for me and the other is mounted under a separate profile that I have just for Steam so when

01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:07.300
I download the Steam games it goes to a separate disk and what that enables me to do is if

01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:15.860
I want to re you know play on the desktop or something like that I can just rsync that

01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:20.220
partition to the home directory of the Steam profile everywhere else so I don't have to

01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:25.220
keep down because I'm on you know wireless internet that's a problem I have at home too

01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:29.540
that's a great idea yeah so you don't have to do it with a separate disk you just have

01:20:29.540 --> 01:20:35.140
a separate profile that you just use for Steam and then you know you can just rsync that

01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:41.020
to your Steam profile Steam accounts you know on your other machines sorry do you log out

01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:45.900
when you want it when you want to game do you log out yeah yeah when I'm when I want to game

01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:50.780
I have a separate profile because I don't have any you know file sync services I have

01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:57.980
a very minimal desktop configuration I have the Compton manager going rather than com

01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:02.380
peers or something like that so it's it's specifically I am going to play a game right

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:05.780
now have you have you told with the idea I know you've probably seen there's tutorials

01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:10.780
to have like a separate big picture mode instance of x running or you can have login you can

01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:15.420
have user sessions that are only Steam big picture have you toyed with that idea yeah

01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:21.700
if I ever make a box to like go in the front room then I would do something like that but

01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:28.200
this is just on my machines I finished working I'm gonna play a game for half an hour log

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:34.080
out log into Steam and it auto starts you know the Steam client it doesn't go to big

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:38.640
picture automatically because you don't always want that but that's how I do it and it works

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:42.620
very well for me and it prevents me having to keep downloading gigabytes and gigabytes

01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:47.940
of stuff over and over and over again is clever I think I might try that I also heard in the

01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:54.020
Ubuntu podcast you're talking about it coming pretty handy at the snap sprint event yeah

01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:59.620
yeah so I lugged it along so I took my Apollo and the Athena with me to the snappy sprint

01:21:59.620 --> 01:22:08.940
event two very different laptops two very different laptops and the reason why is because

01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:16.580
the power supply or rather the internal battery on the Athena is really a UPS that lasts long

01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:24.160
enough for you to unplug the power in one location and walk to it's probably what two

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:28.580
hours two and a half hours yeah it's about yeah it's about two hours yeah so it's not

01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:33.540
that but you know when you compare it to the Apollo yes I I can comfortably get you know

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:39.600
over seven hours I describe the Apollo battery life as I it's one of those laptops where

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:44.340
I open up the I open up the laptop and I don't even consider when was the last time I had

01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:49.520
this on the power adapter that is such a feeling it's so nice yeah it makes it the perfect

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:56.180
go-to really quick at home laptop yeah and the new the new Apollo you can now get with

01:22:56.180 --> 01:23:04.460
16 gigs of RAM as well which is quite tasty yeah yeah so yeah I was using the Athena for

01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:12.340
building snaps because you can now build use snapcraft to build your snaps in Lexd containers

01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:18.420
so you can have multiple snaps building at the same time so consequently I was working

01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:23.220
on a snap start that building switch to a different workspace work on a different snap

01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:28.740
start that building and at one point I had seven or eight snaps building because that's

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:36.420
great just had loads of loads of disk performance it's got 64 gigs of RAM it can do eight threads

01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:41.900
it was just belting through that would be the perfect that's the perfect OBS remote

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:46.080
rig for me so down the road that might be where I go actually why while I'm picking

01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:52.220
your brain so I've been looking at pod publish and I have a secret project in the works that

01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:59.260
I think I want to use pod publish for and I wondered how hard do you think I'm thinking

01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:02.380
about enlisting somebody in the community to make some changes and I wanted to bounce

01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:07.620
it off you one of the things I would like to do is because I believe the pod publish

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:12.940
if I understand correctly one of the one of the files that it'll output is a like we've

01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:17.580
talked about before is an MKV ready for YouTube that takes the audio track and then takes

01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:22.500
a still image for that episode and repeats that still image that matches the length of

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:28.860
the audio track right yeah that's right what kind of changes do you think it they could

01:24:28.860 --> 01:24:32.820
be major I don't know do you think it would take to make it possible to have it loop like

01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:37.980
an mp4 what do you mean by loop an mp4 have a video that is just repeated through the

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:44.820
length of the thing yeah I imagine that'd be quite straightforward yeah that should

01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:50.140
be quite straightforward I love the idea of pod publish and it seems like should I tell

01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:56.100
you the thing I wanted to do yeah using ffmpeg there is a I'm not sure if they're called

01:24:56.100 --> 01:25:06.260
filters but there is a way to generate animations based on audio waveforms wanted to be yes

01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:14.100
was actually just have it you know a spectrograph you know waveform of the audio for the duration

01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:19.180
of the I have been trying to solve this problem since I launched I mean I mean Rick I might

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:24.100
know we have tried we have tried video editing plugins that will try with it try to generate

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:29.940
this I have spent I have spent good money trying to solve this problem well I found

01:25:29.940 --> 01:25:38.380
like half a dozen snippets of how to do this with ffmpeg and I couldn't achieve the exact

01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:43.560
result I wanted to achieve but I did find some reference stuff so if there's somebody

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:48.220
out there who wants to have a go at solving that that would be kind of neat because what

01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:51.740
you could do is have that overlaid on your still image you have your still image your

01:25:51.740 --> 01:25:56.840
cover art yeah it superimposes all of the text for the you know the the episode and

01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:03.740
title and all the rest of it and then you could have that you know spectrum going that

01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:08.700
is so that is so badly what I want that I so badly wanted that I've given up on it and

01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:13.900
I just I just I just assumed I'd have to I'd have to compromise with a mp4 loop because

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:20.100
that is the thing is is I YouTube is a viable publishing platform for a couple of reasons

01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:25.120
first of all it works for a lot of people to get around certain restrictions it's also

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:30.060
has a huge built-in user base existing it's great for discovery just ask the chat room

01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:33.700
a lot of them are in there because they found us on YouTube once and then decided to become

01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:42.020
podcast listeners and then last but not least it may it is it is YouTube links are fundamentally

01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:47.620
just more shareable than an mp3 file with a certain time index in the mp3 file and so

01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:51.080
if you ever want to have your podcast shared with somebody else it kind of has to be up

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:55.660
on YouTube so people can pass the link around but I don't want them just I don't want to

01:26:55.660 --> 01:27:01.300
publish something on YouTube and have people stare at a still image right yeah yeah I agree

01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:07.860
so I would like to do the the audio is there's there could be several podcasts now that end

01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:12.220
up using pod published from a snap and then if we make improvements to it like that it

01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:17.060
could be some podcasts to get that I supply publish for those that don't know is is we've

01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:20.860
talked about it just recently and I think last week show so check that out but it's

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:25.380
a tool that is currently installable as a snap so I have it installed on arch actually

01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:29.620
a surprise surprise and you run it through there you give it you give it your podcast

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:34.220
that you've done and it can output the files you need for people to download but also can

01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:39.220
create the WordPress post and what nots like that and has a I and I file where you specify

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:45.060
the different parameters and it then it it makes it very automated and for somebody who's

01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:49.940
very busy but has a couple of really fun podcast ideas up his sleeve it makes it feel more

01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:55.220
approachable you know a lot of that's just taken care of for you yeah so I'm really excited

01:27:55.220 --> 01:28:00.780
so I've got a fix coming to pod published in next couple of specifically the snap of

01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:05.260
pod publishing in the next couple of days I've had some feedback from running snaps

01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:11.820
on different distros where there's an issue with locales and it can get its pants in a

01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:17.060
twist so I've got a fix coming that will make that so after I install it from a snap it

01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:20.620
doesn't show up in my path does it until I log out and log back in is that is that is

01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:24.980
that how it does it should show it should show up what's the command I run then because

01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:35.420
when I ran this is a implementation detail about snap yeah so if you have a snap for

01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:43.940
say ffmpeg and there's only one binary that you're exposing from that snap called ffmpeg

01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:54.140
it goes half under slash snap lash bin ffmpeg pod publish has four executables in the snap

01:28:54.140 --> 01:29:00.300
so consequently the namespace for the binary is pod published dot and then the name of

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:06.900
the original executable so in your path you should have pod published dot publish underscore

01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:14.260
podcast for example and pod published dot encode underscore podcast and there's a couple

01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:22.040
of others specific to upload oh one one was specific to when I uploaded everything to

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:26.740
youtube for everything even to podcast had done which got us banned so that was the don't

01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:32.380
use that because you can ban yourself you uploaded you know 250 break your account script

01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:39.960
yeah yeah and there's another one that I forget what it does but the main to encode encode

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:47.660
and then publish so with snaps it's pod published dot encode underscore podcast okay and then

01:29:47.660 --> 01:29:54.820
just path to config file and in your config file you tell it where all of the paths to

01:29:54.820 --> 01:30:02.780
your assets are and stuff I'll send you a snippet of I'll redact some bits of the Ubuntu

01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:11.480
podcast okay any file because what we do is like nine tenths of the config file is just

01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:17.700
boilerplate yeah and we just have like six or seven things at the top of the file which

01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:26.860
are the episode number and the markdown for that episode I love it links and then it automatically

01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:31.500
drops all of those necessary markers into the rest of the configuration for you so you

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:39.260
don't have to do a full you know edit of a clean file every time you can start you know

01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:45.940
with a template and just change the few things at the top and it makes you know turning the

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:51.540
publishing round very fast what I like recorded this evening Laura's already updated are any

01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:56.820
files for our show notes so they're ready to go Mark's doing the edit this week which

01:30:56.820 --> 01:31:04.700
he'll do tomorrow so we turn around the publishing very quickly now yeah wow well done and does

01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:09.500
he edit an audacity because that's what I would that's what I'm I guess yeah we both

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:16.140
do yeah so on the Ubuntu podcast org website there's a page called about the show and most

01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:21.820
of that page is actually how we produce the show and all the software we use including

01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:29.060
the server stack and everything I encourage you to continue on pushing pod publish forward

01:31:29.060 --> 01:31:35.580
because it's I haven't really been super interested in automating audio pub podcast

01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:40.220
publishing for a long time and so I haven't really paid attention to it and Noah and I

01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:46.460
and Rekai and West even get helped in a little bit recently have been really working on what

01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:52.620
we are trying to create a way to bring video podcasting up to an entirely new level using

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:57.600
Linux and open source and we don't it's not an automated system but it will be a technology

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:04.900
stack that you use to create essentially super high quality I I think better than than anything

01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:10.160
I've ever seen before video produced podcasts even with remote hosts and whatnot and so

01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:14.480
I I like that you're sort of contributing at the audio end there which is still super

01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:18.900
obviously relevant and something I'm just kind of getting back into and at the same

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:24.000
time we're kind of working on creating sort of a stack that people could deploy to also

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:29.940
make podcasting video wise under Linux super straightforward really high quality so at

01:32:29.940 --> 01:32:34.660
both ends of both audio and video we're sort of working on automating and creating

01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:40.380
the best product under Linux and I think that's going to be really cool for media content

01:32:40.380 --> 01:32:44.420
producers who want to look at Linux and we may one day have these tools available to

01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:49.000
them that give it a edge up over some of the other desktops and we'll make them lead

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:53.340
to proprietary OS's just to publish yeah because really if you can make it easy for

01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:57.200
people to produce their content they'll go with whatever and if we can say this is

01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:01.720
what you use on Linux to make your audio podcast or your video podcasting it you can make really

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:06.420
nice reproducible episodes it automates the process for you it follows these standard

01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:12.440
conventions and this is this is I think something that the Mac has sort of gotten the default

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:16.140
nod to for a long time and maybe maybe maybe we'll make a little bit of a difference

01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:19.580
you know what didn't make it into my Nvidia shield TV review because it didn't even

01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:24.620
cross my mind to try this until I was just in my Google dashboard recently and I was

01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:30.140
you know in Google dashboard you can go back and you can play back all of your dictation

01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:33.780
so whenever you dictate to the keyboard you it'll Google actually keeps a recording of

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:36.980
that and you can play it back and it's kind of interesting because I play it back sometimes

01:33:36.980 --> 01:33:39.780
and I hear my kids in the background and stuff like that it's like it's almost like a little

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:44.540
time capsule up on Google a creepy little time capsule and so I decided to play back

01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:50.260
some of the recordings from the Nvidia shield TV and the audio is super super bad oh really

01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:54.100
and I didn't you know I didn't think that I didn't think about this in the review because

01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:57.400
it just didn't seem like something to eat it's not something you've had to think about

01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:01.220
before how good is the microphone so that way you can do voice dictation because that's

01:34:01.220 --> 01:34:04.900
a key way you interact with the Nvidia shield TV like all YouTube searches it kind of says

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:09.740
you know just hold this button down and talk to it and then it'll search and one of the

01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:14.340
things I discovered and the reason why I realized there might be something going on is I noticed

01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:19.380
that it started detecting Hadia's speech but not my so weird so I would give it to her

01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:22.620
she could search for things but I couldn't search for things hon will you search for

01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:28.420
me again it'll get old it is it is it is very embarrassing actually because it's like I

01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:32.140
sit there and I'll try like three or four times and I start saying it very I try to

01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:35.940
enunciate very clearly and then I have to give it to her and she's just says at once

01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:42.500
and then it's fine so you don't even exist I was a certain pitch let's see that was about

01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:45.300
I'm trying to figure out it doesn't tell me it doesn't really break it down by device

01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:51.660
which devices I was doing that's funny looking at some of the things I've said is kind of

01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:56.980
funny but what I discovered what I discovered is that the audio is really really scratchy

01:34:56.980 --> 01:35:01.180
from the Nvidia shield remote it just has a really crappy crappy that is unfortunate

01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:08.060
yeah it's interesting for Google to have like you know an evaluation of just like evaluating

01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:12.380
these as they come in and giving you like yeah these device has a nice little break

01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:15.740
colored meter or something yeah yeah exactly exactly I was trying to see if I could find

01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:21.100
an example for you this might be it yeah Android TV so let's see this is me saying starbound

01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:27.220
oh that's a dia having to say starbound because it wouldn't work for me she says it so well

01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:38.480
yeah well as he came you could hear it wasn't very good but let's see sage brown it does

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:53.100
sound like sage brown doesn't it round and here it says it got total chaos see how you

01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:59.220
can't you can't understand me you can't understand what I'm saying at all if the microphone is

01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:10.340
just horrible and there you got THR roundtable and there because I think you hear it cut

01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:20.660
out right there yeah yeah it's just so I and then here's me yeah I got that one clearly

01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:26.260
okay Google yeah and that one's from my phone you hear much better that one is so that's

01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:30.420
one thing I don't it's a it's a weird thing to amend to a review but I just kind of figured

01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:35.740
out recently and either really it really depends on where you where you hold it too yeah and

01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:39.540
okay yeah I was and I guess I also just revealed that I'm watching YouTube videos about starbound

01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:44.260
I didn't I didn't mean for that all right I'm excited to announce that Wes is in the

01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:49.960
market for a new switch that's right everyone I do networking switch at home and frames

01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:54.740
they need to go places it's important that they get there quickly what do you what is

01:36:54.740 --> 01:37:00.580
in your requirement list for a new switch quiet how important is quiet not that important

01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:04.660
it's going in the closet look at you with the dedicated networking closet I mean it's

01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:08.540
also there's a lot of other things in that closet but I mean there's gonna be a switch

01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:16.060
in there by dedicated I mean the closet that's right so managed yes I would like a managed

01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:21.260
V lands and all that shenanigans I don't I don't have like a huge need of a crazy number

01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:29.340
of ports but I would like it is your base base amount of ports probably 16 but I could

01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:35.860
get away with eight if it was a nice and and we're talking 100 megabits good absolutely

01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:41.220
not because I need gigabit my upstream is gigabit I need gigabit internally oh yeah

01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:45.060
you do so yeah you do that's really why I'm doing it it's like before everything I had

01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:49.820
your firewall has gigabit networking on it not my current edge device but I'm gonna replace

01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:54.660
that with a tower I have set up I just got a new Intel dual port Nick that I put in which

01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:59.220
I have not set up yet but just sitting there I can see it in LS PCI but I feel like this

01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:02.580
is it we might have an episode topic in the making because you're gonna do what straight

01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:06.820
up Linux right mm-hmm that's the intention I'm gonna try seeing out seeing how if I can

01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:10.940
just do that and how it work Wow so maybe I'll regret it maybe I'll convert it to a

01:38:10.940 --> 01:38:16.660
PF sense box I could always spin that up if you remind me before you go I have a I have

01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:20.460
a switch you could take a look at that you might want to consider it's a silent gigabit

01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:23.540
switch of course you don't care about noise too much but boy have I learned my lesson

01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:27.940
on that one and it's worked really well here in the studio for us oh that's good yeah I

01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:31.500
will have to look at that it's fanless too which is super nice yeah actually that might

01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:38.260
be what it is the anime the neck year GS 724 that might be exactly it in fact if somebody

01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:43.160
would find that on Amazon and ping Angela with it that's she needs that too so also

01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:47.940
I love the HP switches so shout out to Sonic 7-eleven in the chat room for mentioning the

01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:56.540
HP 1910 16g I some of the best switches in my there was a moment in my IT career where

01:38:56.540 --> 01:39:01.180
before HP switches and then there was a moment after HP switches and I'm being dead serious

01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:06.300
like it it was a game changer for me professionally because I constantly was battling with clients

01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:10.740
on the cost of switches they always wanted to lowball that particular component and HP

01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:15.220
switches came along and offered a super competitive product like competitive with Cisco high-end

01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:21.020
products for a much more reasonable price so what might be an $8,000 switch from Cisco

01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:26.540
was a $3,000 switch from HP and now and that price scale has reduced even further now it's

01:39:26.540 --> 01:39:30.840
it they make a good product so definitely love the HP's if you're if you're really looking

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:36.660
I mean so just as an example right I think Angela has like an eight-year-old HP gigabit

01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:45.700
switch 24 port fully managed it's been running non-stop for all damn near as long as I can

01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:52.500
think of I mean no can't it's it's got to be yeah eight years old and damn near eight

01:39:52.500 --> 01:39:56.320
years old West and it's got to be one of the best switches to this day that I've ever owned

01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:02.020
it's a really good one so big plug for HP switches but also I'll have to introduce you

01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:07.580
to my switch that I have in the garage
